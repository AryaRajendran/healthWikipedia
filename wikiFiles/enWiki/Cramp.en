'''Cramps''' are unpleasant, often painful sensations caused by muscle contraction or overshortening. Common causes of [[skeletal muscle]] cramps may include muscle fatigue, [[hyponatremia|low sodium]], [[hypokalemia|low potassium]], and/or [[Magnesium deficiency (medicine)|low magnesium]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}  [[Smooth muscle]] cramps may be due to [[menstruation]] or [[gastroenteritis]].

Muscle cramps may also be a symptom or complication of [[pregnancy]], [[kidney]] disease, [[thyroid]] disease, [[hypokalemia]], [[hypomagnesemia]] or [[hypocalcemia]] (as conditions), [[restless-leg syndrome]], [[varicose veins]],<ref>Bergin J. The Vein Book, Hardcover text, Editor Bergin J , 2007.</ref> and [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name="test2">[http://www.webmd.com/hw-popup/Muscle-cramps Muscle Cramps at WebMD]</ref>

[[Electrolyte]] disturbance may cause cramping and muscle [[tetany (medical sign)|tetany]], particularly [[hypokalaemia]] and [[hypocalcaemia]]. This disturbance arises as the body loses large amounts of [[interstitial fluid]] through [[sweat]]. This interstitial fluid comprises mostly water and table salt ([[sodium chloride]]). The loss of osmotically active particles outside of [[muscle]] cells leads to a disturbance of the [[osmotic]] balance and therefore shrinking of muscle cells, as these contain more osmotically active particles. This causes the calcium pump between the muscle [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] to short circuit; the calcium ions remain bound to the [[troponin]], continuing [[muscle contraction]].

As early as 1965, researchers observed that leg cramps and restless-leg syndrome result from excess [[insulin]], sometimes called [[hyperinsulinemia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=HJ|title=Spontaneous Leg Cramps and "restless Legs" Due to Diabetogenic Hyperinsulinism: Observations on 131 Patients|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|volume=13|pages=602–38|year=1965|pmid=14300967}}</ref> [[Hypoglycemia]] and [[reactive hypoglycemia]] are associated with excess insulin (or insufficient [[glucagon]]), and avoidance of low [[blood]] [[glucose]] [[concentration]] may help to avoid cramps.

===Smooth muscle cramps===
[[Smooth muscle]] contractions may be symptomatic of [[endometriosis]] or other health problems. Menstrual cramps may also occur before and during a female [[menstrual cycle]].

===Skeletal muscle cramps===
[[Skeletal muscle]]s can be voluntarily controlled. Skeletal muscles that cramp the most often are the [[Calf muscle|calves]], [[thighs]], and [[arches of the foot]]. Sometimes known as a [[Charley horse]] or corkie, this kind of cramp is associated with strenuous activity and can be intensely painful&mdash;though skeletal cramps can occur while relaxing. Around 40% of people who experience skeletal cramps are likely to endure extreme muscle pain, and may be unable to use the affected limb. It may take up to seven days for the muscle to return to a pain-free state.

====Nocturnal leg cramps====
[[Nocturnal]] leg cramps are involuntary muscle contractions that occur in the [[Gastrocnemius muscle|calves]], [[Sole (foot)|soles]] of the feet, or other muscles in the body during the night or (less commonly) while resting.
The duration of nocturnal leg cramps is variable with cramps lasting anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Muscle soreness may remain after the cramp itself ends. These cramps are more common in older people.<ref name="mayo">[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/night-leg-cramps/MY00410 Night leg cramps - Mayo Clinic]</ref> They happen quite frequently in teenagers and in some people while exercising at night. The precise cause of these cramps is unclear. Potential contributing factors include [[dehydration]], low levels of certain minerals ([[magnesium]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], and [[sodium]]), and reduced blood flow through muscles attendant in prolonged sitting or lying down. Nocturnal leg cramps (almost exclusively calf cramps) are considered 'normal' during the late stages of pregnancy. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}} They can, however, vary in intensity from mild to extremely painful.

Lactic acid can build up around the muscles which can trigger cramps; however, these happen during anaerobic respiration which happens when a person is exercising or engaging in an activity where the heart beat speeds up.  Medical conditions associated with leg cramps are cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, pregnancy, and lumbar canal stenosis.

Various medications may cause nocturnal leg cramps:<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archinternmed.2011.1029 | pages = archinternmed.2011.1029 | last = Garrison

Gentle stretching and massage, putting some pressure on the affected leg by walking or standing, or taking a warm bath or shower may help to end the cramp.<ref name="nytimes-ray">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/health/09qna.html|title=Q & A – A Charley Horse in Bed |last=Ray|first=C.

===Iatrogenic causes===
[[Statin]]s sometimes cause [[myalgia]] and cramps among other possible side effects. Raloxifene (Evista) is a medication associated with a high incidence of leg cramps.  Additional factors, which increase the probability for these side effects, are physical exercise, age, female gender, history of cramps, and [[hypothyroidism]]. Up to 80% of athletes using statins suffer significant adverse muscular effects, including cramps;<ref>
{{cite journal |author=Sinzinger H, O'Grady J |title=Professional athletes suffering from familial hypercholesterolaemia rarely tolerate statin treatment because of muscular problems |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=525–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15025753 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2003.02044.x |pmc=1884475}}</ref> the rate appears to be approximately 10–25% in a typical statin-using population.<ref>

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Muscle contraction}}
Skeletal muscles work as [[Antagonist (muscle)|antagonistic pairs]]. Contracting one skeletal muscle requires the relaxation of the opposing muscle in the pair. Cramps can occur when muscles are unable to relax properly due to [[myosin]] fibers not fully detaching from [[actin]] filaments. In skeletal muscle, ATP must attach to the myosin heads for them to disassociate from the actin and allow relaxation — the absence of ATP in sufficient quantities means that the myosin heads remains attached to actin. An attempt to force a muscle cramped in this way to extend (by contracting the opposing muscle) can tear muscle tissue and worsen the pain. The muscle must be allowed to recover (resynthesize ATP), before the myosin fibres can detach and allow the muscle to relax.

==Treatment==
Stretching and drinking plenty of fluids, such as water or Gatorade, may be helpful in treating simple muscle cramps.<ref name="PMID 8784961">PMID 8784961</ref> With exertional heat cramps due to [[electrolyte abnormalities]] (primarily sodium loss and not calcium, magnesium, and potassium) appropriate fluids and sufficient salt improves symptoms.<ref>{{doi|10.1016/S1440-2440(03)80005-1}}</ref>

===Medication===
[[Quinine]] is likely to be effective. However, due to side effects its use should only be considered if other treatments have failed and in light of these concerns.<ref name=Katzberg>{{cite journal |author=Katzberg HD, Khan AH, So YT |title=Assessment: Symptomatic treatment for muscle cramps (an evidence-based review): Report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology |journal=Neurology |volume=74 |issue=8 |pages=691–6 |year=2010 |pmid=20177124 |doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181d0ccca}}</ref>  [[Vitamin B complex]], [[naftidrofuryl]], [[lidocaine]], and [[calcium channel blockers]] may be effective for muscle cramps.<ref name=Katzberg/>  Research has also shown that pickle juice can be an effective remedy based on its high sodium and electrolyte content.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Gretchen|title=Phys Ed: Can Pickle Juice Stop Muscle Cramps?|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/phys-ed-can-pickle-juice-stop-muscle-cramps/|accessdate=9/11/2012}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Adequate conditioning, stretching, mental preparation, and adequate fluid/electrolyte balance are likely helpful in preventing muscle cramps.<ref name="PMID 8784961"/>
