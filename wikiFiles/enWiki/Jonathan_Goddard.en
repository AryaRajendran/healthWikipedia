His father Henry Goddard was a wealthy shipbuilder in [[Deptford]].<ref name = RCP>http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/heritage/munksroll/munk_details.asp?ID=1788</ref>  A student at the [[Magdalen Hall, Oxford]], he qualified in medicine at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{Venn|id=GDRT637J2|name=Goddard, Jonathan}}</ref> He joined the [[College of Physicians]] in 1643,<ref name = RCP/> and became physician to [[Charles I of England]] when he was held captive by Parliament. In the 1650s he was made Warden of [[Merton College, Oxford]] (1651), and was one of the '[[Oxford club]]' group around [[John Wilkins]].<ref>http://www.hertford.ox.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=158</ref> He was also a Member of Parliament for [[Oxfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxfordshire]] in the [[Barebone's Parliament]] of 1653.

He was one of five doctors attending Cromwell when he died (the others being [[George Bate]], [[John Bathurst]], [[Thomas Trapham]] and [[Laurence Wright]]).<ref>http://www.reformation.org/dr-george-bate.html</ref>

On the [[English Restoration]] of 1660, he lost his position at Merton. But his early position in the Royal Society was solid (he became a founding Fellow in November, 1660),<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27goddard%27%29 | title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher= Royal Society| accessdate= 24 January 2011}}</ref> and indeed at the beginning of 1661, when the Society was homeless and moved to Gresham College, it met in his lodgings.<ref>Margery Purvey, ''The Royal Society: Concept and Creation'' (1967), pp. 133.</ref>

He was buried in the chancel of Great St Helens church, London.
