'''Colorectal surgery''' is a field in medicine, dealing with disorders of the [[rectum]], [[anus]], and [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. The field is also known as '''proctology''', but the latter term is now used infrequently within medicine, and is most often employed to identify practices relating to the anus and rectum in particular.  The word ''proctology'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words πρωκτός ("''Proktos''"), meaning anus or hindparts, and λόγος ("''Logos''") meaning science or study.

Physicians specializing in this field of medicine are called colorectal surgeons or proctologists. In the United States, to become colorectal surgeons, these surgical doctors have to complete a general surgery residency, as well as a colorectal surgery fellowship, upon which they are eligible to be certified in their field of expertise by the [[American Board of Colon and Rectal Surgery]] or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Proctology]]. In other countries, [[certification]] to practice proctology is given to surgeons at the end of a 2-3 year subspecialty [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] by the country's board of surgery.

==Scope of the specialty==

Colorectal surgical disorders include:

* varicosities or swelling, and [[inflammation]] of [[vein]]s in the rectum and anus ([[Hemorrhoid]]s)
* unnatural cracks or tears in the anus ([[Anal fissure]]s)
* abnormal connections or passageways between the rectum or other anorectal area to the skin surface ([[Fistula]]s)
* severe [[constipation]] conditions
* [[fecal incontinence]]
* protrusion of the walls of the rectum through the anus ([[Rectal prolapse]])
* [[birth defect]]s such as the [[imperforate anus]]
* treatment of severe colic disorders, such as [[Crohn's disease]]
* cancer of the colon and rectum ([[Colorectal cancer]])
* repositioning of the rectal area if fallen out.
* [[anal cancer]] (rare)
* any injuries to the anus
* removal of objects deliberately inserted into anus

==Surgical treatment and diagnostic procedures==
Surgical forms of treatment for these conditions include: [[colectomy]], ileo/colostomy, [[polypectomy]], [[strictureplasty]], hemorrhoidectomy (in severe cases of [[hemorrhoids]]), anoplasty, and more depending on the condition the patient suffers from. Diagnostic procedures, such as a [[colonoscopy]], are very important in colorectal surgery, as they can tell the physician what type of diagnosis should be given and what procedure should be done to correct the condition. Other diagnostic procedures used by colorectal surgeons include: [[proctoscopy]], [[defecating proctogram|defecating proctography]], [[sigmoidoscopy]].   In recent times, the [[laparoscopic]] method of surgery has seen a surge of popularity, due to its lower risks, decreased recovery time, and smaller, more precise incisions achieved by using laparoscopic instruments.

Another new, revolutionary method of surgery, the CARP method (Compression Anastomotic Ring-locking Procedure) is underway in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}  This new method is fast becoming the preferred choice due to exceptional benefits to patients in regards to faster healing process, reliability, and quick leak-detection potential.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}  The reduced need for a protective stoma is another appealing attribute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}
