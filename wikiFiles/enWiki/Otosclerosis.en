'''Otosclerosis''' is an abnormal growth of bone near the [[middle ear]]. It can result in [[hearing loss]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000076785|otosclerosis}}</ref>

==Clinical description==
This is an inherited disease. Otosclerosis can result in conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss. The primary form of hearing loss in otosclerosis is [[conductive hearing loss]] (CHL) whereby sounds reach the ear drum but are incompletely transferred via the ossicular chain in the middle ear, and thus partly fail to reach the [[inner ear]] ([[cochlea]]). This usually will begin in one ear but will eventually affect both ears with a variable course. On [[audiometry]], the hearing loss is characteristically low-frequency, with higher frequencies being affected later. [[Sensorineural hearing loss]] (SNHL) has also been noted in patients with otosclerosis; this is usually a high-frequency loss, and usually manifests late in the disease. The causal link between otosclerosis and SNHL remains controversial.

Approximately 0.5% of the population will eventually be diagnosed with otosclerosis. Post mortem studies show that as many as 10% of people may have otosclerotic lesions of their temporal bone, but apparently never had symptoms warranting a diagnosis. Caucasians are the most affected race, with the prevalence in the Black and Asian populations being much lower. In clinical practice otosclerosis is encountered about twice as frequently in females as in males, but this does not reflect the true sex ratio. When families are investigated it is found that the condition is only slightly more common in women.<ref>Morrison AW (1970) Otosclerosis: a synopsis of natural history and management.

The hearing loss was long believed to grow worse during pregnancy, but recent research does not support this belief.<ref name=dSG2003>{{Cite book |last=de Souza |first = Christopher | last2= Glassock | first2=Michael |title=Otosclerosis and Stapedectomy: Diagnosis, Management & Complications |year=2003 |isbn=1-58890-169-6 |publisher=Thieme |location=New York, NY |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref name="pmid16222205">{{cite journal |author=Lippy WH, Berenholz LP, Schuring AG, Burkey JM |title=Does pregnancy affect otosclerosis? |journal=[[Laryngoscope]] |volume= 115|issue=10 |pages= 1833|year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16222205|doi=10.1097/01.MLG.0000187573.99335.85 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121607933/abstract}}</ref>

==Genetics==
The disease can be considered to be hereditary, but its [[penetrance]] and the degree of expression is so highly variable that it may be difficult to detect an inheritance pattern.  Most of the implicated genes are transmitted in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion. One genome-wide analysis associates otosclerosis with variation in [[reelin|RELN]] gene.<!--

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of otosclerosis is complex.  The key lesions of otosclerosis are multifocal areas of sclerosis within the endochondral temporal bone.  These lesions share some characteristics with [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget’s Disease]], but they are not thought to be otherwise related.  Histopathologic studies have all been done on cadaveric temporal bones, so only inferences can be made about progression of the disease histologically.  It seems that the lesions go through an active “spongiotic” / hypervascular phase before developing into “sclerotic” phase lesions.  There have been many genes and proteins identified that, when mutated, may lead to these lesions.  Also there is mounting evidence that [[measles virus]] is present within the otosclerotic foci, implicating an infectious etiology (this has also been noted in Paget’s Disease).

CHL in otosclerosis is caused by two main sites of involvement of the sclerotic (or scar-like) lesions.  The best understood mechanism is fixation of the [[stapes]] footplate to the [[oval window]] of the [[cochlea]].  This greatly impairs movement of the stapes and therefore transmission of sound into the inner ear (“ossicular coupling”).  Additionally the cochlea’s round window can also become sclerotic, and in a similar way impair movement of sound pressure waves through the inner ear (“acoustic coupling”).

SNHL in otosclerosis is controversial.  Over the past century, leading otologists and neurotologic researchers have argued whether the finding of SNHL late in the course of otosclerosis is due to otosclerosis or simply to typical [[presbycusis]].  There are certainly a few well documented instances of sclerotic lesions directly obliterating sensory structures within the cochlea and spiral ligament, which have been photographed and reported post-mortem.  Other supporting data includes a consistent loss of cochlear hair cells in patients with otosclerosis; these cells being the chief sensory organs of sound reception.  A suggested mechanism for this is the release of hydrolytic enzymes into the inner ear structures by the spongiotic lesions.

==Diagnosis==
Otosclerosis is traditionally diagnosed by characteristic
clinical findings, which include progressive conductive
hearing loss, a normal tympanic membrane, and no evidence
of middle ear inflammation. The cochlear promontory may have a faint pink tinge reflecting
the vascularity of the lesion, referred to as the [[Schwartz sign]].
Conductive hearing loss is usually secondary to impingement
of abnormal bone on the stapes footplate. This involvement
of the oval window forms the basis of the name fenestral
otosclerosis. The most common location of involvement of
otosclerosis is the bone just anterior to the oval window at a
small cleft known as the fissula ante fenestram. The fissula is
a thin fold of connective tissue extending through the endochondral
layer, approximately between the oval window and
the cochleariform process, where the tensor tympani tendon
turns laterally toward the malleus.

Imaging is usually not pursued in those with
uncomplicated conductive hearing loss and characteristic
clinical findings. Those with only conductive hearing loss
are often treated medically or with surgery without imaging.
The diagnosis may be unclear clinically in cases
of sensorineural or mixed hearing loss and may become apparent
only on imaging. Therefore, imaging is often performed
when the hearing loss is
sensorineural or mixed. The mechanism of sensorineural
hearing loss in otosclerosis is less well understood. It may result
from direct injury to the cochlea and spiral ligament from
the lytic process or from release of proteolytic enzymes into
the cochlea.

A high-resolution [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] shows very subtle bone findings. However, CT is usually not needed prior to surgery.

Otosclerosis on CT can be graded using the grading system suggested by Symons and Fanning.<ref>Lee TC, Aviv RI, Chen JM, Nedzelski JM, Fox AJ, Symons SP: CT grading of otosclerosis. American Journal of Neuroradiology, 2009 August, 30(7):1435-1439. Epub 2009 March 25.</ref> 
* Grade 1, solely fenestral; 
* Grade 2, patchy localized cochlear disease (with or without fenestral involvement) to either the basal cochlear turn (grade 2A), or the middle/apical turns (grade 2B), or both the basal turn and the middle/apical turns (grade 2C); and 
* Grade 3, diffuse confluent cochlear involvement (with or without fenestral involvement).

==Treatment==
{{See|Hearing aids|Stapedectomy}}
Treatment of otosclerosis relies on two primary options: [[hearing aid]]s (more recently including bone-conduction hearing aids) and a surgery called a [[stapedectomy]].  Hearing aids are usually very effective early in the course of the disease, but eventually a stapedectomy (or more frequently a variant called the stapedotomy) may be required for definitive treatment.  Early attempts at hearing restoration via the simple freeing the stapes from its sclerotic attachments to the oval window were met with temporary improvement in hearing, but the conductive hearing loss would almost always recur. A stapedectomy consists of removing a portion of the sclerotic stapes footplate and replacing it with an implant that is secured to the incus.  This procedure restores continuity of ossicular movement and allows transmission of sound waves from the eardrum to the inner ear. A modern variant of this surgery called a stapedotomy, is performed by drilling a small hole in the stapes footplate with a micro-drill or a laser, and the insertion of a piston-like prothesis. The success rate of either surgery depends greatly on the skill and the familiarity with the procedure of the surgeon.<ref name=dSG2003/> However, comparisons have shown stapedotomy to yield results at least as good as stapedectomy, with fewer complications, and thus stapedotomy is preferred under normal circumstances.<ref>Thamjarayakul T, Supiyaphun P & Snidvongs K, Stapes fixation surgery: Stapedectomy versus stapedotomy, Asian Biomedicine, 4(3): 429-434, 2010.</ref>

Other less successful treatments involve pharmaceuticals or orally ingested supplements. One is fluoride administration, which theoretically becomes incorporated into bone and inhibits otosclerotic progression. This treatment cannot reverse conductive hearing loss, but may slow the progression of both the conductive and sensorineural components of the disease process. Otoflour is one such widely used medicine, comprising sodium fluoride. Recently, some success has been claimed with a second such treatment, [[bisphosphonate]] medications that inhibit bone destruction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brookler K |title=Medical treatment of otosclerosis: rationale for use of bisphosphonates |journal=Int Tinnitus J |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=92–6 |year=2008 |pmid=19205157 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>http://www.freshpatents.com/-dt20090716ptan20090181108.php?type=description</ref><ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=9s7RQ74WgikC&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=Biphosphonate+otosclerosis&source=bl&ots=FW3U7hq0wr&sig=SLAZ4zS1Fo8NRCslUlH8wJIY8kE&hl=ru&ei=PA8dS9v8GJrImgOVyZHZAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Biphosphonate%20otosclerosis&f=false</ref> However, these early reports are based on non-randomized case studies that do not meet standards of clinical trials.<ref>Chole RA & McKenna M, Pathophysiology of otosclerosis, Otology & Neurotology, 22(2): 249-257, 2001.</ref> There are numerous side-effects to both pharmaceutical treatments, including occasional stomach upset, allergic itching, and increased joint pains which can lead to arthritis.<ref>[http://www.american-hearing.org/disorders/hearing/otosclerosis.html#treatment Otosclerosis] at the [[American Hearing Research Foundation]] Chicago, Illinois 2008.</ref> In the worst case, bisphosphonates may lead to [[osteonecrosis]] of the auditory canal itself.<ref>Polizzotto MN, Cousins Polizzotto & Schwarer AP, Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the auditory canal, [[British Journal of Haematology]], 132(1): 114, 2005.</ref> Finally, neither approach has been proven to be beneficial after the commonly preferred method of surgery has been undertaken.
