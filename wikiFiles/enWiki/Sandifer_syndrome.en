'''Sandifer syndrome''' (or ''Sandifer's'' [[syndrome]]) is a <ref name="NIH">http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Disease.aspx?PageID=4&diseaseID=9684</ref><ref name="Orpha">http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Disease_Search.php?lng=EN&data_id=10994&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseGroup=sandifer&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseType=Pat&Disease(s)%20concerned=Sandifer-syndrome&title=Sandifer-syndrome&search=Disease_Search_Simple</ref> [[paediatric]] medical disorder, characterised by [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] symptoms and associated [[Neurology|neurological]] features<ref name="Orpha"/><ref name="BMJ">http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/66/6/805</ref> There is a significant correlation between the syndrome and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD), however it is estimated to occur in less than 1% of children with reflux.<ref name="emed">http://www.emedicine.com/PED/topic2039.htm</ref>

== Symptoms and signs ==
Onset is usually confined to infancy and early childhood,<ref name="Orpha"/> with peak prevalence at 18–36 months.<ref name="emed"/>  In rare cases, particularly where the child is severely mentally impaired, onset may extend to adolescence.<ref name="emed"/>

The classical symptoms of the syndrome are [[spasmodic torticollis]] and [[dystonia]].<ref name="BMJ"/><ref name="emed"/><ref name="medscape">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/410654_3</ref>  Nodding and rotation of the head, neck extension, gurgling, writhing movements of the limbs, and severe hypotonia have also been noted.<ref name="BMJ"/>

Spasms may last for 1–3 minutes and may occur up to 10 times a day.  Ingestion of food is often associated with occurrence of symptoms; this may result in reluctance to feed.  Associated symptoms, such as [[epigastric]] discomfort, vomiting (which may involve [[Haematemesis|blood]]) and abnormal eye movements have been reported.  Clinical signs may also include anaemia.<ref name="Orpha"/>

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is made on the basis of the association of gastro-oesophageal reflux with the characteristic movement disorder. Neurological examination is usually normal. Misdiagnosis as benign infantile spasms or epileptic seizures is common, particularly where clear signs or symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux are not apparent. Early diagnosis is critical, as treatment is simple and leads to prompt resolution of the movement disorder.<ref name="Orpha"/>

== Treatment ==
Successful treatment of the associated underlying disorder, such as GERD or hiatal hernia, may provide relief.<ref name="emed"/>

== Prognosis ==
Sandifer syndrome is not typically life-threatening<ref name="emed"/> and prognosis is good.<ref name="Orpha"/>
