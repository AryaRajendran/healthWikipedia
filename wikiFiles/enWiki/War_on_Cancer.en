The '''War on Cancer''' refers to the effort to find a cure for [[cancer]] by increased [[cancer research|research]] to improve the understanding of cancer biology and the development of more effective [[cancer treatments]], such as [[Targeted therapy|targeted drug therapies]]. The aim of such efforts is to eradicate cancer as a major [[cause of death]]. The signing of the [[National Cancer Act of 1971]] by then [[Richard Nixon|U.S. President Richard Nixon]] is generally viewed as the beginning of the war on cancer, though it was not described as a "war" in the legislation itself.<ref name=NCAo71>{{cite web

===Obama-Biden Plan to Combat Cancer===

During their [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential campaign]] then Senators [[Barack Obama]] and [[Joe Biden]] published a plan to combat cancer that entailed doubling "federal funding for cancer research within 5 years, focusing on [[NIH]] and [[NCI]]" as well as working "with Congress to increase funding for the

Their plan would provide additional funding for:

* the study of health disparities and evaluation of possible interventions,
* and efforts to better understand genetic factors that can impact cancer onset and outcomes.

President Obama's [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 economic stimulus package]] includes $10 billion for the [[NIH]], which funds much of the [[cancer research]] in the U.S., and he has pledged to increase federal funding for cancer research by a third for the next two years as part of a drive to find "a cure for cancer in our time."<ref>{{cite news

A 2010 report from the [[American Cancer Society]] found that death rates for all cancers combined decreased 1.3% per year from 2001 to 2006 in males and 0.5% per year from 1998 to 2006 in females, largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colorectum) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). Cancer death rates between 1990 and 2006 for all races combined decreased by 21.0% among men and by 12.3% among women. This reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. Despite these reductions, the report noted, cancer still accounts for more deaths than [[heart disease]] in persons younger than 85 years.<ref>{{cite journal

An improvement in the number of cancer survivors living in the U.S. was indicated in a 2011 report by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] and the [[National Cancer Institute|NCI]], which noted that the number of cancer survivors in 2007 (11.7 million) increased by 19% from 2001 (9.8 million survivors). The number of cancer survivors in 1971 was 3 million. [[Breast cancer|Breast]], [[Prostate cancer|prostate]], and [[Colorectal cancer|colorectal]] cancers were the most common types of cancer among survivors, accounting for 51% of diagnoses. As of January 1, 2007, an estimated 64.8% of cancer survivors had lived ≥5 years after their diagnosis of cancer, and 59.5% of survivors were aged ≥65 years.<ref>{{cite web

Since there are many different forms of cancer with distinct causes, each form requires different treatment approaches. However, this research could still lead to therapies and cures for many forms of cancer. Some of the factors that have posed challenges for the development of [[Cancer#Prevention|preventive]] measures and anti-cancer drugs and therapies include the following:

Speaking on the occasion of the announcement of $1 billion in new funding for genome-based cancer research, Dr. [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]], director of the [[NIH]] claimed, "We are about to see a quantum leap in our understanding of cancer."<ref name=obamaSep09 /> [[Harold Varmus]], after his appointment to be the director of the [[NCI]], said we are in a "golden era for cancer research," poised to profit from advances in our understanding of the cancer genome.<ref name=Varmus2010_scifri />

In a cancer research funding announcement made by president Obama in September 2009, TCGA project is slated to receive $175 million in funding to collect comprehensive gene sequence data on 20,000 tissue samples from people with more than 20 different types of cancer, in order to help researchers understand the genetic changes underlying cancer. New, targeted therapeutic approaches are expected to arise from the insights resulting from such studies.<ref name=obamaSep09 />

====Cancer Genome Project====
The [[Cancer Genome Project]] at the [[Sanger Institute|Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]] aims to identify [[genetic variation|sequence variant]]s/[[mutation]]s critical in the development of human [[cancer]]s. The Cancer Genome Project combines knowledge of the [[human genome]] sequence with [[high-throughput screening|high throughput mutation detection]] techniques.<ref>{{cite web

===Cancer research supportive infrastructure===
Advances in [[information technology]] supporting cancer research, such as the [[National Cancer Institute|NCI]]'s [[caBIG]] project, promise to improve data sharing among cancer researchers and accelerate "the discovery of new approaches for the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and [[Cancer#Prevention|prevention]] of cancer, ultimately improving patient outcomes."<ref>{{cite web

==Modern cancer treatment==
===Cancer clinical trials===
Researchers are considering ways to improve the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and overall success rate of cancer clinical trials.<ref>{{cite book

Increased participation in rigorously designed clinical trials would increase the pace of research.  Currently, about 3% of people with cancer participate in clinical trials; more than half of them are patients for whom no other options are left, patients who are participating in "exploratory" trials designed to burnish the researchers' résumés or promote a drug rather than to produce meaningful information, or in trials that will not enroll enough patients to produce a [[statistically significant]] result.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Recommending a clinical trial to a patient normally causes physicians and cancer centers to lose time and money while increasing their legal risks and volume of paperwork.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Targeted tumor treatment===
A major challenge in cancer treatment is to find better ways to specifically target tumors with drugs and [[chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic agents]] in order to provide a more effective, localized dose and to minimize exposure of healthy tissue in other parts of the body to the potentially adverse effects of the treatments. The accessibility of different tissues and organs to anti-tumor drugs contributes to this challenge. For example, the [[blood–brain barrier]] blocks many drugs that may otherwise be effective against brain tumors. In November 2009, a new, experimental therapeutic approach for treating [[glioblastoma]] was published in which the anti-tumor drug [[Avastin]] was delivered to turmor site within the brain through the use of [[catheter|microcatheters]], along with [[mannitol]] to temporarily open the blood–brain barrier permitting delivery of the chemotherapy into the brain.<ref>{{cite news

==Public education and support==
An important aspect to the war on cancer is improving public access to educational and supportive resources, to provide individuals with the latest information about cancer [[Cancer#Prevention|prevention]] and [[Management of cancer|treatment]], as well as access to support communities. Resources have been created by governmental and other organizations to provide support for cancer patients, their families and caregivers, to help them share information and find advice to guide decision making.<ref>{{cite web
