'''Gluten sensitivity''' (also '''gluten intolerance''') is a spectrum of disorders, including [[coeliac disease|celiac disease]] and [[wheat allergy]], in which [[gluten]] has an adverse effect on the body. Symptoms include bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, diarrhea, muscular disturbances and bone or joint pain.<ref name="ReferenceA">Sapone A et al. Differential mucosal IL-17 expression in two gliadin-induced disorders: gluten sensitivity and the autoimmune enteropathy celiac disease. International Archives of Allergy and Immunology. 2010;152:75-80</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">Hadjivassiliou M et al. Myopathy associated with gluten sensitivity. Muscle Nerve. 2007;35:443-450</ref>

Gluten gives elasticity to [[dough]] helping it to rise and to keep its shape. It is found in many staple foods in the Western diet. It is a [[protein]] composite found in [[wheat]] and other grains, including [[barley]] and [[rye]] and processed foods thereof. Gluten is composed of a [[gliadin]] fraction (alcohol soluble) and a [[glutenin]] fraction (only soluble in dilute acids or alkali). Gluten is not naturally occurring in [[corn]], [[rice]], or [[oats]], but may be cross-contaminated by facilities that also process wheat, barley, or rye products.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of gluten sensitivity include bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain,constipation and diarrhea, and might present extraintestinal symptoms including muscular disturbances and bone or joint pain.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===Difference between idiopathic gluten sensitivity and celiac disease===
In a recent clinical paper, gluten sensitivity was defined as ''one or more of a variety of immunological, morphological or symptomatic manifestations that may also be shared by celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)''.<ref>Verdu EF, Armstrong D, Murray JA. Between celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome: The ‘No Man’s Land’ of Gluten Sensitivity. The American Journal of Gastroenterology. 2009;104(6):1587-1594</ref> In cases where there is reactivity to gluten, yet celiac disease and wheat allergy are eliminated as possibilities, gluten sensitivity may be considered. Whilst the general clinical picture for gluten sensitivity is similar to celiac disease in particular, it is usually less severe and neither anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies nor autoimmune comorbidities are found.

It is believed that approximately 40-50% of gluten sensitivity patients may have IgG or IgA anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA).<ref>Sapone A et al. (2010). Differential mucosal IL-17 expression in two gliadin-induced disorders: gluten sensitivity and the autoimmune enteropathy celiac disease. International Archives of Allergy & Immunology; 152: 75-80</ref><ref>Bizzaro N et al. (2010) Cutting edge issues in celiac disease and in gluten intolerance. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & immunology.</ref> There is also a study identifying approximately 50% of gluten sensitivity patients, few more than the general population, carry either HLA DQ 2 or 8.<ref>Sapone A et al. (2010). Differential mucosal IL-17 expression in two gliadin-induced disorders: gluten sensitivity and the autoimmune enteropathy celiac disease. International Archives of Allergy & Immunology; 152: 75-80.</ref> On closer inspection, it has also been found that such gluten-sensitive subjects lack histological lesions; fall below Marsh 2 ''celiac Disease'' score and indicating that there may be some infiltration of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. In addition, it has been found that they have normal intestinal permeability and an increased expression of Toll Like receptors 2 (TLR2) but no change in the cytokines involved in adaptive immune responses Th1 and Th17 such as IL-6, IL-17 A, IL 21, which are increased only in patients with celiac disease. The types of responses indicate an innate immune system involvement, but not autoimmune disease.

Gluten sensitivity should have a defined cause, although not apparent always with first examination, affected individuals should eventually fall into GSE or wheat allergy. Only rarely should gluten sensitivity be idiopathic. Idiopathic gluten sensitivity (IGS) arises ''spontaneously or from an obscure or unknown cause'' and may involve neuropathy, myopathy, dermal, or intestinal abnormalities. Anti-gliadin antibodies are the primary link between gluten and idiopathic sensitivity in instances "in which enteropathy or allergy are not clearly involved".<ref>Hadjivassiliou M, Grünewald R, Sharrack B, et al. (2003). "Gluten ataxia in perspective: epidemiology, genetic susceptibility and clinical characteristics". Brain 126 (Pt 3): 685–91. {{doi|10.1093/brain/awg050}}. PMID 12566288.</ref>

==Etiology==
When enteropathy develops in early childhood symptomatic disease is more rapidly evident. A survey of geriatrics with celiac disease in Finland revealed that the incidence of disease was much higher than the general population.<ref>A. Vilpulla, P. Collin, M. Maki et al (2008) "Undetected coeliac disease in the elderly. A biopsy-proven population-based study." Digestive and Liver Disease 40 (2008) 809-813</ref> Allergic disease may rise or fall with age; certain evidence points to the increased or daily use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory factors (aspirin, ibuprofen) as an increased risk factor for urticaria or anaphylaxis, and the sensitizing dose may include low-dose aspirin therapy used in the treatment of heart disease. Idiopathic disease appears largely late onset.

Researchers reported extreme fatigue and pain in patients without celiac disease, with gliadin antibodies. They called this a "non-celiac gluten intolerance" for which there is no explanation as to the mechanisms involved.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Biesiekierski, Jessica R et al | title=Gluten Causes Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Subjects Without Celiac Disease: A Double-Blind Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial|journal=Am J Gastroenterol | volume=106 | issue=3 |pages=508–514 | year=2011 | month=March | doi=10.1038/ajg.2010.487|url= | pmid = 21224837}}</ref>

==Causes of gluten sensitivity==

===''Triticeae'' and the potential role of selective evolution in gluten sensitivities===
The fruiting bodies of plants contain genes as well as reserves of nutrients that allow seedlings to grow. The enrichment of nutrients is an attractant to herbivores and omnivores. For annual grasses that release seeds during a brief period each year there is a need to protect seeds during maturation from insects or animals, which might stock seeds for year round usage. For wheat, alpha-gliadins are seed-storage proteins, but also act as inhibitors of alpha-amylase activity in some animals, particularly in insects.<ref name="pmid16628930">{{cite journal |author=Bandani AR |title=Effect of plant a-amylase inhibitors on sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps Puton (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae), alpha-amylase activity |journal=Commun.

===Immunochemistry of glutens===
{{Main|Gluten immunochemistry}}

[[Triticeae glutens|''Triticeae'' glutens]] are important factors in several inflammatory diseases. The immunochemistry can be subdivided into innate responses (direct stimulation of immune system), [[MHC class II|class II]] mediated presentation ([[HLA DQ]]), [[MHC class I|class I]] mediated stimulation of [[killer cells]], and [[antibody]] recognition. The responses to [[gluten]] proteins and [[polypeptide]] regions differs according to the type of gluten sensitivity. The response is also dependent on the genetic makeup of the [[human leukocyte antigen]] genes. In enteropathy, there are at least 3 types of recognition, [[innate immunity]] (a form of cellular immunity priming), HLA-DQ and antibody recognition of gliadin and transglutaminase.<ref name="pmid16766754">{{cite journal |author=van Heel DA, West J |title=Recent advances in coeliac disease |journal=Gut |volume=55 |issue=7 |pages=1037–46 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16766754 |doi=10.1136/gut.2005.075119 |url= |pmc=1856316}}</ref>

One study recommended biopsy samples running distally from the duodenum to avoid the risk of false negatives. Eliminating the possibility of celiac disease can generally be done by adding [[HLA-DQ]] typing, in which  [[HLA-DQ2|DQ2]] and [[HLA-DQ8|DQ8]] are found in enteropathy 98% of the time in Caucasians, [[HLA-DQ7#DQ7.5|DQ7.5]] the remaining 1.6% and 0.4% not found with either of these 3. Without ATA or HLA-DQ2/8 positivity, celiac disease is not likely the cause of the sensitivity.
In either case, other avenues of diagnostics, such as allergy testing are available.<ref name="pmid11063153">{{cite journal |author=Kaukinen K, Turjanmaa K, Mäki M, ''et al.'' |title=Intolerance to cereals is not specific for coeliac disease |journal=Scand.

From the perspective of gluten sensitivity there is no single definition of gluten that concisely defines all potentially pathogenic glutens. With wheat allergies, there can be a wide spectrum of species that may trigger allergies with similar proteins, the omega-gliadin proteins have similar proteins found in oats at high frequency, but omega-gliadin allergy is not a predictor of oat allergy or intolerance.<ref name="pmid6154431">{{cite journal | author = Baldo BA, Krilis S, Wrigley CW | title = Hypersensitivity to inhaled flour allergens.

Glutelins have not been characterized over broad taxa. With idiopathic gluten sensitivity, the antibodies that correlate with disease are [[anti-gliadin antibodies]]. Whether these antibodies are pathogenic or are indicators of circulating gliadin is unknown. For gluten-sensitive enteropathy, gliadin and homologous proteins from rye and barley cause disease. T-cell epitopes implicated in disease have been found in glutinous protein genes in all species sequenced within the tribe ''Triticeae''.<ref name=Kupper>{{cite journal | author = Kupper C | title = Dietary guidelines and implementation for celiac disease | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 128 | issue = 4 Suppl 1 | pages = S121–7 | year = 2005 | pmid=15825119 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.02.024}}</ref>

===Tolerable levels of gluten===
In summary of recent developments, oats can be tolerated in a gluten-free diet, but oat products should be limited in contamination from ''Triticeae'' derived gluten to 20 PPM (20&nbsp;mg per kg).

===Diets===
{{Main|Gluten-free diet}}
Gluten-free oats can provide a valuable source of fiber, vitamin B, iron, zinc and complex carbohydrates.<ref name="pmid12844381">{{cite journal |author=Størsrud S, Hulthén LR, Lenner RA |title=Beneficial effects of oats in the gluten-free diet of adults with special reference to nutrient status, symptoms and subjective experiences |journal=Br. J. Nutr. |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=101–7 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12844381 |doi= 10.1079/BJN2003872|url=}}</ref> Recent studies show that gluten-sensitive individuals on a gluten-free diet often get too much simple carbohydrate, too little fiber and vitamin B. Currently most guidelines do not include oats in a gluten-free diet. While this is likely to change, oats are not recommended within a year of diagnosis because of the oat-sensitive enteropathy (ASE) risk, the desire to establish a clinical baseline and complexity of the contamination issue.<ref name="Rashid">{{cite web

Consuming oats when anti-gliadin antibodies or gliadin are present increases anti-avenin antibodies, and may promote ASE. Duodenal biopsy may be recommended after oat consumption is initiated. The DQ phenotype of all 3 ASE individuals studied so far indicated DQ2 homozygotes are at risk for ASE. Preferably, newly diagnosed celiacs seek the help of a dietician. Guidelines are also available for the introduction of pure, uncontaminated oats into the gluten-free diet.<ref name="Rashid"/>
