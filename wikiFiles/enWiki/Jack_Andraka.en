'''Jack Thomas Andraka ''' (born in 1997) is an [[inventor]], [[scientist]] and [[cancer researcher]]. He is the 2012 [[Intel Science Fair]] grand prize winner. Andraka was awarded the [[Gordon E. Moore]] Award for his work in developing a new, rapid, and inexpensive method to detect an increase of a protein that indicates the presence of pancreatic, ovarian, and lung cancer during early stages when there is a higher likelihood of a cure. <ref name=Intel>

==Background==
Hailing from [[Crownsville, Maryland]], Jack Andraka has given a number of accounts of what inspired him to work on pancreatic cancer, including the death of his uncle and an acquaintance.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2270016/The-15-year-old-schoolboy-invention-revolutionise-cancer-detection.html | title=Did this 15-year-old just change the course of medicine?

In an interview with the [[BBC]], Jack said the idea for his pancreatic cancer test came to him while he was in biology class at [[North County High School]], drawing on the class lesson about [[antibodies]] and the article on analytical methods using [[carbon nanotubes]] he was surreptitiously reading in class at the time.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19291258  |title=US teen invents advanced cancer test using Google |work= BBC|date=20 August 2012 }}</ref> Afterward, he followed up with more research using [[Google Search]] on nanotubes and cancer biochemistry, aided by [[open access|free online scientific journals]].

He then contacted 200 professors at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]] with a plan, a budget, and timeline for his project in order to receive laboratory help. He had received nearly 200 rejection emails before he got a positive reply from Dr. Anirban Maitra, Professor of Pathology, Oncology, and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]].<ref name="smithsonian">{{cite web | last = Tucker | first = Abigail | title = Jack Andraka, the Teen Prodigy of Pancreatic Cancer | publisher = [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian magazine]]  | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Jack-Andraka-the-Teen-Prodigy-of-Pancreatic-Cancer-179996151.html | accessdate = 2012-12-28}}</ref>

The result of his project was a new [[dipstick]] type diagnostic test for pancreatic cancer using a novel paper sensor, similar to that of the diabetic test strip. This strip tests for the level of [[mesothelin]], a pancreatic cancer biomarker, in blood or urine, to determine whether or not a patient has early-stage pancreatic cancer. The test is over 90 percent accurate in detecting the presence of mesothelin.<ref name=Intel/> According to Andraka, it is also 168 times faster, 26,000 times less expensive (costing around three cents), over 400 times more sensitive than the current diagnostic tests and only takes five minutes to run. He says the test is also effective for detecting ovarian and lung cancer, due to the same mesothelin biomarker they have in common.<ref name=WSJ/>

Professor Maitra is very enthusiastic about Andraka's future. He told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' "You're going to read about him a lot in the years to come... What I tell my lab is, 'Think of Thomas Edison and the light bulb.' This kid is the Edison of our times. There are going to be a lot of light bulbs coming from him."<ref name=Burris/>

==Family interested in science==

The boys' father, Steve Andraka, is a [[civil engineer]]. Their mother, Jane Andraka, is an [[anesthetist]]. She told the ''Sun'' "... we're not a super-athletic family. We don't go to much football or baseball." "Instead we have a million [science] magazines [and] sit around the table and talk about how people came up with their ideas and what we would do differently."<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Burris|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-05-24/news/bs-ar-student-intel-winner-20120523_1_top-prize-grand-prize-intel-science-fair|title=North County Student Wins Intel Prize|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=2012-05-24|accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref>

Jack's older brother, Luke, won $96,000 in prizes at the [[Intel International Science and Engineering Fair]] in 2010, with a project that examined how acid mine drainage affected the environment.  In 2011, Luke won a [[Traditions and student activities at MIT#MIT THINK Competition|MIT THINK]] Award (Technology for Humanity guided by Innovation, Networking, and Knowledge), which recognizes students whose science projects benefit their communities.<ref name=Burris/>

==Method==
Andraka cultured [[MIA PaCa]] cells, from a commercial pancreatic carcinoma [[Cell culture|cell line]], which overexpress [[mesothelin]], a [[biomarker]] for pancreatic cancer. The mesothelin was isolated, concentrated and quantified with [[ELISA]].<ref name=SFS>{{cite web |url=http://apps.societyforscience.org/intelisef2012/project.cfm?PID=ME028&CFID=28485&CFTOKEN=10931553 |title= A Novel Paper Sensor for the Detection of Pancreatic Cancer |last=Andraka |first=Jack |publisher=Society for Science & the Public |accessdate= 22 August 2012 |work=ME028 (Andraka)}}</ref>  After optimization with the [[Western Blot]] assay, the human mesothelin-specific [[antibody|antibodies]] were mixed with [[single walled carbon nanotubes]] and used to coat strips of ordinary filter paper. This made the paper conductive. The optimal layering was determined using a [[scanning electron microscope]]. Cell media spiked with varying amounts of mesothelin was then tested against the paper biosensor and any change in the electrical potential of the sensor strip (due to the changing conductivity of the nanotubes) was measured, before and after each application. Specifically, what happened was this:

<blockquote>The antibodies would bind to the mesothelin and enlarge. These beefed-up molecules would spread the nanotubes farther apart, changing the electrical properties of the network: The more mesothelin present, the more antibodies would bind and grow big, and the weaker the electrical signal would become.<ref name=smithsonian/>
</blockquote>

A dose-response curve was constructed with an [[Coefficient of determination|R<sup>2</sup>]] value of .9992. Tests on human blood serum obtained from both healthy people and patients with chronic [[pancreatitis]], [[pancreatic cancer#Exocrine pancreas cancers |pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia]] (a precursor to pancreatic carcinoma), or pancreatic cancer showed a similar response. The sensorâ€™s limit of detection sensitivity was found to be 0.156 ng/mL; 10 ng/mL is considered the level of overexpression of mesothelin consistent with pancreatic cancer. Andraka's sensor costs $0.03 (to compare to a $800 cost of a standard test<ref>based on this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=n9yuAhusVts TEDx conference by Jack Andraka].</ref>) and 10 tests can be performed per strip, taking 5 minutes each. The method is 168 times faster, 26,667 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive than ELISA, and 25% to 50% more accurate than the [[CA19-9]] test.<ref name=SFS/>

Officials at Intel have said that Andraka's method is more than 90 percent accurate in detecting the presence of mesothelin.<ref name=Intel/> He has patented his method of sensing pancreatic cancer and is communicating with companies about developing an over-the-counter test.<ref name=BBC/>
