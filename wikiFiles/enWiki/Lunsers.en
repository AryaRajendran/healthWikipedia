'''Lunsers''' refers to the '''L'''iverpool '''U'''niversity '''N'''euroleptic '''S'''ide '''E'''ffect '''R'''ating '''S'''cale.

==Overview==
Within the field of [[psychiatry]], many simple and complex tools exist for the rating of such things as severity of illness and problems associated with the use of medications, for treating [[mental illness]]. The medications used to treat mental illness—particularly psychotic disorders—are referred to as anti-psychotics or [[neuroleptics]]. Both phrases, although generally used interchangeably, are not actually the same.

The lunsers is designed to monitor medication-induced side effects. This psychiatric assessment tools allows for the monitoring of side effects related to [[neuroleptic]] (or anti-psychotic) medications. The test is a self-reported check-tick box format with a predefined scale from "not at all" to "very much". The test asks 51 questions in all with a number being [[Red herring (plot device)|red herrings]] to test for people over-rating themselves. It has been proposed that this is useful for spotting [[malingerer]]s and [[hypochondriac]]s, however its intention in the original research proposal for Lunsers was to demonstrate the robustness and reliability of self-reporting.

There are seven subcategories in the overall results:
* [[Extrapyramidal system|Extrapyramidal]] – parkinsonion type side effects.
* [[Autonomic nervous system|Autonomic]] – related to uncontrollable side effects.
* [[Psychic]] – relating to the functioning of mind and emotion.
* miscellaneous/various – known side effects without category.
* [[Anticholinergic]] – side-effects impacting the choline system.
* [[Allergic reaction]].
* [[Prolactin]] – many neuroleptics affect hormones particularly prolactin.

And, of course, 
* red herrings – designed to trap people who over-rate symptoms.
