'''DICOM''' ('''Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine''') is a standard for handling, storing, printing, and [[data transmission|transmitting]] information in [[medical imaging]]. It includes a [[file format]] definition and a network [[communications protocol]]. The communication protocol is an application protocol that uses [[TCP/IP]] to communicate between systems. DICOM files can be exchanged between two entities that are capable of receiving image and patient data in DICOM format. The [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] (NEMA) holds the copyright to this standard.<ref>[http://medical.nema.org/dicom/geninfo/Brochure.pdf DICOM brochure], nema.org.</ref> It was developed by the DICOM Standards Committee, whose members<ref>[http://medical.nema.org/members.pdf MEMBERS of the DICOM STANDARDS COMMITTEE]</ref> are also partly members of NEMA.<ref>[http://www.nema.org/About/Pages/Members.aspx]</ref>

DICOM enables the integration of scanners, servers, workstations, printers, and network hardware from multiple manufacturers into a [[picture archiving and communication system]] (PACS). The different devices come with DICOM conformance statements which clearly state which DICOM classes they support. DICOM has been widely adopted by [[hospital]]s and is making inroads in smaller applications like dentists' and doctors' offices.

DICOM is known as [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association|NEMA]] standard PS3, and as [[ISO standard]] 12052:2006 "Health informatics -- Digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) including workflow and data management".

== History ==
[[File:Acrnema1.jpg|thumb|Front page of ACR/NEMA 300, version 1.0, which was released in 1985]]

DICOM is the First version of a standard developed by [[American College of Radiology]] (ACR) and [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] (NEMA).

In the beginning of the 1980s, it was very difficult for anyone other than manufacturers of [[computed tomography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] devices to decode the images that the machines generated. Radiologists and medical physicists wanted to use the images for dose-planning for [[radiation therapy]]. ACR and NEMA joined forces and formed a standard committee in 1983. Their first standard, ACR/NEMA 300, was released in 1985. Very soon after its release, it became clear that improvements were needed. The text was vague and had internal contradictions.

In 1988 the second version was released. This version gained more acceptance among vendors. The image transmission was specified as over a dedicated 2 pair cable (EIA-485). The first demonstration of ACR/NEMA V2.0 interconnectivity technology was held at Georgetown University, May 21â€“23, 1990.  Six companies participated in this event, DeJarnette Research Systems, General Electric Medical Systems, Merge Technologies, Siemens Medical Systems, Vortech (acquired by Kodak that same year) and 3M.  Commercial equipment supporting ACR/NEMA 2.0 was presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in 1990 by these same vendors.  Many soon realized that the second version also needed improvement. Several extensions to ACR/NEMA 2.0 were created, like Papyrus (developed by the University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland) and SPI (Standard Product Interconnect), driven by Siemens Medical Systems and Philips Medical Systems.

The first large-scale deployment of ACR/NEMA technology was made in 1992 by the US Army and Air Force, as part of the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7612705?dopt=Abstract MDIS (Medical Diagnostic Imaging Support)] program run out of Ft. Detrick, Maryland. Loral Aerospace and Siemens Medical Systems led a consortium of companies in deploying the first US military [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS (Picture Archiving and Communications System)]] at all major Army and Air Force medical treatment facilities and teleradiology nodes at a large number of US military clinics. DeJarnette Research Systems and Merge Technologies provided the modality gateway interfaces from third party imaging modalities to the Siemens SPI network.  The Veterans Administration and the Navy also purchased systems off this contract.

In 1993 the third version of the standard was released. Its name was then changed to "DICOM" so as to improve the possibility of international acceptance as a standard. New service classes were defined, network support added and the Conformance Statement was introduced. Officially, the latest version of the standard is still 3.0. However, it has been constantly updated and extended since 1993. Instead of using the version number, the standard is often version-numbered using the release year, like "the 2007 version of DICOM".

While the DICOM standard has achieved a near universal level of acceptance amongst medical imaging equipment vendors and healthcare IT organizations, the standard has its limitations.  DICOM is a standard directed at addressing technical interoperability issues in medical imaging.  It is not a framework or architecture for achieving a useful clinical workflow.  RSNA's [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE)]] initiative layered on top of DICOM (and [[HL7|HL-7]]) provides this final piece of the medical imaging interoperability puzzle.

=== Derivations ===

There are some derivations from the DICOM standard into other application areas. These include:
* DICONDE - ''Digital Imaging and Communication in Nondestructive Evaluation'', was established in 2004 as a way for [[nondestructive testing]] manufacturers and users to share image data.<ref>[http://www.astm.org/SNEWS/OCTOBER_2003/voelker_oct03.html http://www.astm.org: If a Picture Is Worth 1,000 Words, then Pervasive, Ubiquitous Imaging Is Priceless]</ref>
* DICOS - ''Digital Imaging and Communication in Security'' was established in 2009 to be used for image sharing in [[airport security]].<ref>[http://www.nema.org/prod/security/indust-Img.cfm http://www.nema.org: Industrial Imaging and Communications Section]</ref>

== DICOM data format ==

DICOM differs from some, but not all, data formats in that it groups information into [[data set]]s. That means that a file of a chest x-ray image, for example, actually contains the patient ID within the file, so that the image can never be separated from this information by mistake. This is similar to the way that image formats such as [[JPEG]] can also have embedded tags to identify and otherwise describe the image.

A DICOM data object consists of a number of attributes, including items such as name, ID, etc., and also one special attribute containing the image pixel data (i.e. logically, the main object has no "header" as such: merely a list of attributes, including the pixel data). A single DICOM object can have only one attribute containing pixel data. For many modalities, this corresponds to a single image. But note that the attribute may contain multiple "frames", allowing storage of cine loops or other multi-frame data. Another example is NM data, where an NM image, by definition, is a multi-dimensional multi-frame image. In these cases, three- or four-dimensional data can be encapsulated in a single DICOM object. Pixel data can be compressed using a variety of standards, including [[JPEG]], [[JPEG Lossless]], [[JPEG 2000]], and [[Run-length encoding|Run-length encoding (RLE)]]. [[LZW]] (zip) compression can be used for the whole data set (not just the pixel data), but this has rarely been implemented.

DICOM uses three different Data Element encoding schemes. With Explicit Value Representation (VR) Data Elements, for VRs that are not OB, OW, OF, SQ, UT, or UN, the format for each Data Element is: GROUP (2 bytes) ELEMENT (2 bytes) VR (2 bytes) LengthInByte (2 bytes) Data (variable length). For the other Explicit Data Elements or Implicit Data Elements, see section 7.1 of Part 5 of the DICOM Standard.

The same basic format is used for all applications, including network and file usage, but when written to a file, usually a true "header" (containing copies of a few key attributes and details of the application which wrote it) is added.

In addition to a Value Representation, each attribute also has a Value Multiplicity to indicate the number of data elements contained in the attribute.  For character string value representations, if more than one data element is being encoded, the successive data elements are separated by the backslash character "\".

== DICOM services ==

DICOM consists of many different services, most of which involve transmission of data over a network, and the file format below is a later and relatively minor addition to the standard.

=== Store ===

The DICOM Store service is used to send images or other persistent objects (structured reports, etc.) to a [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]] or workstation.

=== Storage commitment ===

The DICOM storage commitment service is used to confirm that an image has been permanently stored by a device (either on redundant disks or on backup media, e.g. burnt to a CD).  The Service Class User (SCU: similar to a [[Clientâ€“server model|client]]), a modality or workstation, etc., uses the confirmation from the Service Class Provider (SCP: similar to a [[Clientâ€“server model|server]]), an archive station for instance, to make sure that it is safe to delete the images locally.

=== Query/Retrieve ===

This enables a workstation to find lists of images or other such objects and then retrieve them from a [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]].

=== Modality worklist ===

This enables a piece of imaging equipment (a modality) to obtain details of patients and scheduled examinations electronically, avoiding the need to type such information multiple times (and the mistakes caused by retyping).

=== Modality performed procedure step ===

A complementary service to Modality Worklist, this enables the modality to send a report about a performed examination including data about the images acquired, beginning time, end time, and duration of a study, dose delivered, etc.
It helps give the radiology department a more precise handle on resource (acquisition station) use.  Also known as MPPS, this service allows a modality to better coordinate with image storage servers by giving the server a list of objects to send before or while actually sending such objects.

=== Printing ===

The DICOM Printing service is used to send images to a DICOM Printer, normally to print an "X-Ray" film. There is a standard calibration (defined in DICOM Part 14) to help ensure consistency between various display devices, including hard copy printout.

=== Off-line media (DICOM files) ===

The off-line media files correspond to Part 10 of the DICOM standard. It describes how to store medical imaging information on removable media. Except for the data set containing, for example, an image and demography, it's also mandatory to include the File Meta Information.

DICOM restricts the filenames on DICOM media to 8 characters (some systems wrongly use 8.3, but this does not conform to the standard). No information must be extracted from these names (PS3.10 Section 6.2.3.2). This is a common source of problems with media created by developers who did not read the specifications carefully.  This is a historical requirement to maintain compatibility with older existing systems. It also mandates the presence of a [[media directory]], the [[DICOMDIR]] file, which provides index and summary information for all the DICOM files on the media.
The DICOMDIR information provides substantially greater information about each file than any filename could, so there is less need for meaningful file names.

DICOM files typically have a .dcm file extension if they are not part of a DICOM media (which requires them to be without extension).

The [[MIME]] type for DICOM files is defined by RFC 3240 as application/dicom.

The [[Uniform Type Identifier]] type for DICOM files is org.nema.dicom.

There is also an ongoing media exchange test and "connectathon" process for CD media and network operation that is organized by the [[Integrating the Healthcare Environment|IHE]] organization.  [[MicroDicom]] is free Windows software for reading DICOM data.

== DICOM transmission protocol port numbers over IP ==

DICOM have reserved the following [[TCP and UDP port]] numbers by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA):
* 104 [[well-known port]] for DICOM over [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]. Since 104 is in the reserved subset, many operating systems require special privileges to use it.
* 2761 [[registered port]] for DICOM using [[Integrated Secure Communication Layer]] (ISCL) over TCP or UDP
* 2762 registered port for DICOM using [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) over TCP or UDP
* 11112 registered port for DICOM using standard, open communication over TCP or UDP
The standard recommends but does not require the use of these port numbers.

== Disadvantages of DICOM ==
A major disadvantage of the DICOM Standard is the possibility for entering probably too many optional fields. This disadvantage is mostly showing in inconsistency of filling all the fields with the data . Some image objects are often incomplete because some fields are left blank and some are filled with incorrect data.http://www.vcl.fer.hr/papers_pdf/Overview%20of%20the%20DICOM%20Standard.pdf
