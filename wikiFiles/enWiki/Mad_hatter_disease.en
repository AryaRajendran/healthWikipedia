'''Mad hatter disease''', or '''mad hatter syndrome''', is a commonly used name for [[occupational disease|occupational]] chronic [[mercury poisoning]] among [[hatmaker]]s  whose [[felting]] work involved prolonged exposure to [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapours. The neurotoxic effects included [[Intention tremor|tremor]] and the pathological shyness and irritability characteristic of [[erethism]].

Use of [[Mercury_poisoning#Inorganic_mercury_compounds|inorganic mercury]] in the form of [[mercuric nitrate]] to treat the fur of small animals for the manufacture of felt hats seems to have begun in 17th-century France and from there spread to England by the end of the century with the [[Huguenot]]s. By the [[Victorian era]] the hatters' condition had become proverbial, as reflected in popular expressions like "[[mad as a hatter]]" and the '''hatters' shakes'''. Similar phenomena had been described in [[St Petersburg]], Russia, in 1829. In France, the [[French Academy of Medicine|National Academy of Medicine]] described the health hazards in 1869, and in 1898 a law was passed to protect hatmakers from the risks of mercury exposure. In Britain, mercury poisoning among hatters had become a rarity by the turn of the 20th century. In the United States, where the occupational illness was thoroughly described in [[New Jersey]] in 1860, the practice continued until 1941; mercury poisoning in the hatmaking industries of [[Danbury, Connecticut]] gave rise to the expression the '''Danbury shakes'''. Hatmakers in [[Tuscany]], Italy, were also affected and exposed workers received [[Workers' compensation|financial compensation]].

Although [[Lewis Carroll]]'s iconic [[Mad Hatter]] character in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' has often been linked to the occupational hazards of hatmaking, it is thought that the character was directly inspired by the eccentric furniture dealer [[Theophilus Carter]].

Especially in the 19th century, [[Mercury_poisoning#Inorganic_mercury_compounds|inorganic mercury]] in the form of [[mercuric nitrate]] was commonly used in the production of [[felt]] for hats.<ref name="Columbia Encyclopedia">{{cite book|title=Columbia Encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|editor=Lagassé, Paul}}</ref>  During a process called carroting, in which furs from small animals such as rabbits, hares or beavers were separated from their skins and matted together, an orange-colored solution containing mercuric nitrate was used as a smoothing agent.

This process was initially kept a [[trade secret]] in France, where hatmaking rapidly became a hazardous occupation.  At the end of the 17th century the Huguenots carried the secret to England, following the [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]]. During the [[Victorian era]] the  hatters' malaise became proverbial, as reflected in popular expressions like "[[mad as a hatter]]" (see [[#Mad_as_a_Hatter|below]]) and "the hatters' shakes".<ref name=Waldron1983/><ref name=survey1924/><ref name=Bigham2005>{{cite journal|last=Bigham|first=Gary|coauthors=Henry, Betsy; Bessinger, Brad|title=Mercury—A Tale of Two Toxins|journal=Natural Resources & Environment|year=2005|volume=19|issue=4|pages=26–30, 71|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40924607|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>

The first description of symptoms of mercury poisoning among hatters appears to have been made in [[St Petersburg]], Russia, in 1829.<ref name=Buckell1946/> In the United States, a thorough occupational description of mercury poisoning among [[#Hatters_of_New_Jersey|New Jersey hatters]] was published locally by Addison Freeman in 1860.<ref name=Wedeen1989/><ref name=Freeman1860/> [[Adolph Kussmaul]]'s definitive clinical description of mercury poisoning published in 1861 contained only passing references to hatmakers, including a case originally reported in 1845 of a 15-year-old Parisian girl, the severity of whose tremors following two years of carroting prompted opium treatment.<ref name=Wedeen1989>{{cite journal|last=Wedeen|first=RP|title=Were the hatters of New Jersey 'mad'?|quote=What remains most remarkable about the hatters of New Jersey is that they expressed no anger about their working conditions.

In 1869, the [[French Academy of Medicine]] demonstrated the health hazards posed to hatmakers. Alternatives to mercury use in hatmaking became available by 1874. In the United States, a [[hydrochloride]]-based process was patented in 1888 to obviate the use of mercury, but was ignored.<ref name=Kitzmiller>{{cite web|last=Kitzmiller|first=Kathryn J|title=The Not-So-Mad Hatter: occupational hazards of mercury|url=http://www.cas.org/news/insights/science-connections/mad-hatter|work=Chemical Abstracts Service|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=9 March 2013|quote=What remains most remarkable about the hatters of New Jersey is that they expressed no anger about their working conditions.

In the United States, the mercury-based process continued to be adopted until as late as 1941, when it was abandoned mainly due to the wartime need for the heavy metal in the manufacture of detonators.<ref name=Wedeen1989/><ref name=Kitzmiller/> Thus, for much of the 20th century mercury poisoning remained common in the U.S. hatmaking industries, including those located in [[Danbury, Connecticut]] (giving rise to the expression the "Danbury shakes").<ref name=Bigham2005/><ref name=Buckell1946>{{cite journal|last=Buckell|first=M|coauthors=Hunter, D; Milton, R; Perry, KM|title=Chronic mercury poisoning. 1946|journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine|date=February 1993; originally published, 1946|volume=50|issue=2|pages=97–106|pmid=8435354}}</ref>

==Symptoms and effects==
{{Quote box |width=530px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote =
The man affected is easily upset and embarrassed, loses all joy in life and lives in constant fear of being dismissed from his job. He has a sense of timidity and may lose self control before visitors. Thus, if one stops to watch such a man in a factory, he will sometimes throw down his tools and turn in anger on the intruder, saying he cannot work if watched. Occasionally a man is obliged to give up work because he can no longer take orders without losing his temper or, if he is  a foreman, because he has no patience with men under him. Drowsiness, depression,  loss  of  memory and insomnia may occur, but hallucinations, delusions and mania are rare. <br> The most characteristic symptom, though it is seldom the first to appear, is mercurial tremor. It is neither as fine nor as regular as that of [[hyperthyroidism]]. It  may be  interrupted  every  few minutes by coarse jerky movements. It  usually begins in the fingers, but the eyelids, lips and tongue are affected early. As it progresses it passes to the arms and legs, so that it  becomes very difficult for
a man to walk about the workshop, and he may have to be guided to his bench. At this stage the condition is so obvious that it is known to the layman as "hatter's shakes."

==Hatters of New Jersey==
The experience of hatmakers in [[New Jersey]] is well documented and has been reviewed by Richard Wedeen.<ref name=Wedeen1989/> In 1860, at a time when the hatmaking industry in towns such as [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Orange, New Jersey|Orange]] and [[Bloomfield, New Jersey|Bloomfield]] was growing rapidly, a physician from Orange called J. Addison Freeman published an article titled "Mercurial Disease Among Hatters" in the ''Transactions of the Medical Society of New Jersey''. This groundbreaking paper provided a clinical account of the effects of chronic mercury poisoning among the workforce, coupled with an occupational description of the use of mercuric nitrate during carroting and inhalation of mercury vapour later in the process (during finishing, forming and sizing). Freeman concluded that "A proper regard for the health of this class of citizens demands that mercury should not be used so extensively in the manufacture of hats, and that if its use is essential, that the hat finishers' room should be large, with a high ceiling, and well ventilated."<ref name=Freeman1860>{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=J. Addison|title=Mercurial Disease Among Hatters|journal=Transactions of the Medical Society of New Jersey|year=1860|page=61-64|quote = During the winter of 1858–59 and following spring, there prevailed quite extensively among the hatters of Orange, Newark, Bloomfield, and Milburn a disease showing all the medical characteristics of Mercurial Salivation and [[Stomatitis]]. More than a hundred cases occurred in Orange alone. The usual symptoms were ulceration of the gums, loosening of the teeth, foeter of the breath, abnormal saliva, tremors of the upper extremities, or a shaking palsy,... the result of inhaling air impregnated with mercury vapor.}} (Cited in Wedeen, 1989)</ref>  Freeman's call for prevention went unheeded.

In 1878, an inspection of 25 firms around Newark conducted by Dr L. Dennis on behalf of the [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] Medical Society revealed "mercurial disease" in 25% of 1,589 hatters. Dennis recognized that this prevalence figure was probably an [[reporting bias|underestimate]], given the workers' fear of being fired if they admitted to being diseased. Although Dennis did recommend the use of fans in the workplace he attributed most of the hatters' health problems to alcohol abuse (thus using the [[Social stigma|stigma]] of drunkenness in a mainly immigrant workforce to justify the insanitary working conditions provided by employers).<ref name=Wedeen1989/><ref name=Dennis1878>{{cite journal|last=Dennis|first=L|title=Hatting: As effecting the health of operatives|journal=Report of the New Jersey State Board of Health|year=1878|volume=2|pages=67-85}} (Cited in Wedeen, 1989)</ref>

The surprise is that men can be induced to work at all in such death producing enclosures. It is hard to believe that men of ordinary intelligence could be so indifferent to the ordinary laws of health... It does not seem to have occurred to them that all the efforts to keep up wages... [are] largely offset by the impairment of their health, due to neglect of proper hygienic regulations of their workshops... And when the fact of the workmen in the sizing room, who stand in water, was mentioned, and the simple and inexpensive means by which it could be largely avoided was spoken of, the reply was that it would cost money and hat manufacturers did not care to expend money for such purposes, if they could avoid it.

Some voluntary reductions in mercury exposure were implemented after Lawrence T. Fell, a former [[journeyman]] hatter from Orange who had become a successful manufacturer, was appointed Inspector of Factories in 1883. In the late nineteenth century, a pressing health issue among hatters was [[tuberculosis]]. This deadly communicable disease was rife in the extremely [[hygiene|unhygienic]] wet and steamy enclosed spaces in which the hatters were expected to work (in its annual report for 1889, the New Jersey Bureau of Labor and Industries expressed incredulity at the conditions—box).  Two-thirds of the recorded deaths of hatters in Newark and Orange between 1873 and 1876 were caused by pulmonary disease, most often in men under 30 years of age, and elevated death rates from tuberculosis persisted into the twentieth century. Consequently, [[public health]] campaigns to prevent tuberculosis spreading from the hatters into the wider community tended to eclipse the issue of mercury poisoning. For instance, in 1886 J. W. Stickler, working on behalf of the [[New Jersey Board of Health]], promoted prevention of tuberculosis among hatters, but deemed mercurialism "uncommon", despite having reported tremors in 15–50% of the workers he had surveyed.<ref name=Wedeen1989/><ref name=Stickler1896/1887>{{cite journal|last=Stickler|first=JW|title=Hatters' consumption|journal=New York Medical Journal|date=1896|year=1896|volume=43|pages=598-602}}  (Cited in Wedeen, 1989) {{br}} {{cite book|last=Stickler|first=JW|title=Tenth Annual Report of the Board of Health of New Jersey and Report of the Bureau of Vital Statistics 1886|year=1887|publisher=John L.

While hatters seemed to regard the shakes as an inevitable price to pay for their work rather than a readily [[Disease prevention|preventable disease]], their employers professed ignorance of the problem. In a 1901 survey of 11 employers of over a thousand hatters in Newark and Orange, the head of the Bureau of Statistics of New Jersey, William Stainsby, found  a lack of awareness of any disease peculiar to hatters apart from tuberculosis and rheumatism (though one employer remarked that "work at the trade develops an inordinate craving for strong drink").<ref name=Wedeen1989/><ref name=Stainsby1901>{{cite book|last=Stainsby|first=W|title=Twenty-Fourth Annual Report of the Bureau of Statistics of New Jersey|year=1901|location=Trenton NJ|chapter=Diseases and Disease Tendencies of Occupations: The Glass Industry and the Hatting Industry.}} (Cited in Wedeen, 1989)</ref>

By 1934 the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] estimated that 80% of American felt makers had mercurial tremors. Nevertheless, [[trade union]] campaigns (led by the Unites States Hat Finishers Association, originally formed in 1854) never addressed the issue and, unlike in France, no relevant legislation was ever adopted in the United States. Instead, it seems to have been the need for mercury in the [[war effort]] that eventually brought to an end the use of mercuric nitrate in U.S. hatmaking; in a meeting convened by the U.S. Public Health Service in 1941, the manufacturers voluntarily agreed to adopt a readily available alternative process using [[hydrogen peroxide]].<ref name=Wedeen1989/>
