In [[medicine]], the '''Ottawa ankle rules''' are a set of guidelines for clinicians to help decide if a patient with foot or [[ankle]] pain should be offered [[X-ray]]s to diagnose a possible [[bone fracture]]. Before the introduction of the rules most patients with ankle injuries would have been imaged. However the vast majority of patients with unclear ankle injuries do not have bony fractures.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sujitkumar P, Hadfield JM, Yates DW |title=Sprain or fracture? An analysis of 2000 ankle injuries |journal=Arch Emerg Med |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=101–6 |year=1986 |month=June |pmid=3089238 |pmc=1285323 |doi= |url=}}</ref> As a result many unnecessary X-rays were taken, which was costly, time consuming and a slight health risk due to radiation exposure.  

==The Ottawa ankle rules==
Ankle X-ray is only required if there is any pain in the malleolar zone and any one of the following:
* Bone tenderness along the [[anatomical terms of location|distal]] 6&nbsp;cm of the [[anatomical terms of location|posterior]] edge of the [[tibia]] or tip of the [[medial malleolus]], OR
* Bone tenderness along the distal 6&nbsp;cm of the posterior edge of the [[fibula]] or tip of the [[lateral malleolus]], OR
* An inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency department for four steps.

Additionally, the Ottawa foot rules indicate whether a foot X-ray series is required. It states that it is indicated if there is any pain in the midfoot zone and any one of the following:
* Bone tenderness at the base of the fifth [[metatarsal]] (for foot injuries), OR
* Bone tenderness at the [[navicular]] bone (for foot injuries), OR
* An inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency department for four steps.

Certain groups are excluded, in particular [[pregnant]] women, and those with diminished ability to follow the test (for example due to [[head injury]] or [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]]). Several studies strongly support the use of the Ottawa Ankle Rules in children over 6 (98.5% sensitivity);<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dowling S, Spooner CH, Liang Y, ''et al.'' |title=Accuracy of Ottawa Ankle Rules to exclude fractures of the ankle and midfoot in children: a meta-analysis |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=277–87 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19187397 |doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2008.00333.x }}</ref> however, their usefulness in younger children has not yet been thoroughly examined.

==Utility of the Ottawa rules==

The rules have been found to have a very high [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]], moderate [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]], therefore a very low rate of [[Type I and type II errors|false negative]]s. Evidence in [[systematic review]]s supports the Ottawa ankle rules as an accurate instrument for excluding fractures of the ankle and mid-foot and reducing the number of unnecessary investigations.

The original study reported that the test was 100% sensitive and reduced the number of ankle X-rays by 36%.<ref name=stiell_1554175>{{cite journal | pmid = 1554175 | volume=21 | issue=4 | title=A study to develop clinical decision rules for the use of radiography in acute ankle injuries | year=1992 | month=April | author=Stiell IG, Greenberg GH, McKnight RD, Nair RC, McDowell I, Worthington JR | journal=Ann Emerg Med | pages=384–90}}</ref> A second trial with a larger number of patients replicated these findings.<ref name=stiell_8114236>{{cite journal | pmid = 8114236 | volume=271 | issue=11 | title=Implementation of the Ottawa ankle rules | year=1994 | month=March | author=Stiell IG, McKnight RD, Greenberg GH, ''et al.'' | journal=JAMA | pages=827–32}}</ref>  Subsequently, a multi-centre study explored the feasibility of implementing the rules on a wider scale.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/311/7005/594 | pmid = 7663253 | pmc=2550661 | volume=311 | issue=7005 | title=Multicentre trial to introduce the Ottawa ankle rules for use of radiography in acute ankle injuries.

==Generalization to other joints==
The original rules were developed for ankle and foot injuries only, but similar guidelines have been developed for other injuries such as the Ottawa Knee Rule.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stiell IG, Greenberg GH, Wells GA, ''et al.'' |title=Prospective validation of a decision rule for the use of radiography in acute knee injuries |journal=JAMA |volume=275 |issue=8 |pages=611–5 |year=1996 |month=February |pmid=8594242 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=275&page=611 |doi=10.1001/jama.275.8.611}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Stiell I |title=Ottawa Knee Rule |work=Clinical Decision Rules |publisher=Emergency Medicine Research Group, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute |url=http://www.ohri.ca/emerg/cdr/knee.html}}</ref>

==History==
This list of rules was published in 1992 by a team of doctors in the emergency department of the Ottawa Civic Hospital in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]].<ref name=stiell_1554175/>  Since the rules were formulated in Ottawa they were dubbed the ''Ottawa ankle rules'' by their creators a few years after their development, a title that has stuck.<ref name=stiell_8114236/>   In this respect, the naming of the rules is similar to that of the [[Bristol stool scale]] or the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] (GCS), which also take their names from the cities in which they were formulated.
