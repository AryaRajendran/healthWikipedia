'''Involution''' refers to the shrinking or return of an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] to a former size. At a cellular level, involution is characterized by the process of [[proteolysis]] of the [[basement membrane]] (basal lamina), leading to epithelial regression and [[apoptosis]], with accompanying [[stromal cell|stromal]] [[fibrosis]]. The consequent reduction in cell number and reorganization of stromal tissue leads to the reduction in the size of the organ.

==Examples==
===Thymus===
The [[thymus]] continues to grow between [[birth]] and [[puberty]] and then begins to [[atrophy]], a process directed by the high levels of circulating [[sex hormones]]. Proportional to thymic size, thymic activity ([[T cell]] output) is most active before [[puberty]]. Upon atrophy, the size and activity are dramatically reduced, and the organ is primarily replaced with [[fat]]. The atrophy is due to the increased circulating level of [[sex hormones]], and chemical or physical castration of an adult results in the thymus increasing in size and activity. <ref>Sutherland JS. Activation of thymic regeneration in mice and humans following androgen blockade. ''J Immunol'' 2005 15;175(4):2741-53</ref>

===Uterus===
Involution is the process by which the [[uterus]] is transformed from pregnant to non-pregnant state. It is a physiological process occurring after e.g. [[parturition]]; the [[hypertrophy]] of the [[uterus]] has to be undone since it does not need to house the [[fetus]] anymore. This process is primarily due the hormone [[oxytocin]].

===Mammary gland===
During [[pregnancy]] until after birth, [[mammary glands]] grow steadily to a size required for optimal milk production. At the end of [[breastfeeding]], the number of cells in the mammary gland becomes reduced until approximately the same number is reached as before the start of pregnancy.
