'''Epi-LASIK''' is a [[refractive surgery]] technique designed to reduce a person's dependency on [[eyeglasses]] and [[contact lenses]]. Invented by Dr. [[Ioannis Pallikaris]] ([[Crete]], [[Greece]]), the technique is basically an automatic [[photorefractive keratectomy|LASEK]] without [[alcohol]]:It can be better considered as superficial [[LASIK]]. The stromal bed is smoother than that obtained by mechanical methods or brush. Unlike alcohol (LASEK) there is no chance of damaging the limbal stem cells. It is also relatively less painful than LASEK.

# A device similar to a [[microkeratome]] (called epi-keratome) slides over the surface of the [[cornea]], just underneath  the epithelial layer of cells while suction is applied.
# The result is a hinged sheet of epithelium that is at least partially viable.
# It is reflected out of the way so that the [[ablation]] can take place.
# The sheet is repositioned and a bandage soft contact lens is placed on the eye.

Advantages
# Less damage to corneal nerves, hence safer in dry eyes
# If cornea is abnormal for LASIK, epilasik may still be an option

The first cases outside Greece were performed in September 2003.

==Complications==
Although relatively uncommon, the following are some of the more frequently reported complications of Epi-LASIK [http://www.complicatedeyes.org/complications.htm]:
* Slower or delayed epithelial healing
* Duplication of epithelium
*Over/undercorrection
*[[Visual acuity]] fluctuation
*Halos around light sources
*Starbursts around light sources
*Decentered ablation
*Corneal Haze
*Epithelium erosion
*Loss of epithelial flap
