'''Total body irradiation''' (TBI) is a form of [[radiotherapy]] used primarily as part of the preparative regimen for [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|haematopoietic stem cell (or bone marrow) transplantation]]. As the name implies, TBI involves irradiation of the entire body, though in modern practice the [[lung]]s are often partially shielded to lower the risk of radiation-induced lung injury.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gore EM, Lawton CA, Ash RC, Lipchik RJ |title=Pulmonary function changes in long-term survivors of bone marrow transplantation |journal=Int.

Additionally, high doses of total body irradiation can eradicate residual [[cancer]] cells in the transplant recipient, increasing the likelihood that the transplant will be successful.

Doses of total body irradiation used in bone marrow transplantation typically range from 10 to >12 [[gray (unit)|Gy]]. For reference, a dose of 4.5 Gy is [[Median lethal dose|fatal in 50% of exposed individuals]] without aggressive medical care.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090730004606/http://www1.va.gov/emshg/docs/Radiological_Medical_Countermeasures_Indexed-Final.pdf Department of Homeland Security Working Group on Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD) Preparedness], from the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]. Accessed May 29, 2008.</ref> Such high total body doses are made possible by spreading the total dose out between several sessions, or "fractions," with an interval of time in between allowing other normal tissues some time to repair some of the damage caused. However, at these doses, total body irradiation both destroys the patient's bone marrow (allowing donor marrow to engraft) and kills residual cancer cells. [[Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation#Non-myeloablative_.28or_.22mini.22.29_allogeneic_transplants|Non-myeloablative bone marrow transplantation]] uses lower doses of total body irradiation, typically about 2 Gy, which do not destroy the host bone marrow but do suppress the host immune system sufficiently to promote donor engraftment.

In modern practice, total body irradiation is typically fractionated. Early research in bone marrow transplantation by [[E. Donnall Thomas]] and colleagues demonstrated that this process of splitting TBI into multiple smaller doses resulted in lower toxicity and better outcomes than delivering a single, large dose.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thomas ED |title=Marrow transplantation for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in first remission |journal=N.

In addition to its use in bone marrow transplantation, total body irradiation has been explored as a treatment modality for high-risk [[Ewing sarcoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kinsella TJ |title=Intensive combined modality therapy including low-dose TBI in high-risk Ewing's Sarcoma Patients |journal=Int.
