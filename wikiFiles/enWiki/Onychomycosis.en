This condition may affect [[toenail]]s or [[fingernail]]s, but toenail infections are particularly common.  The prevalence of onychomycosis is about 6–8% in the adult population.<ref>{{cite web |title=Impact 07 – Dermatology |url=http://www.baybio.org/pdf/IMPACT07_Derm.pdf |format=PDF |year=2007 |publisher=Bay Bio |accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>

==Classification==
There are four classic types of onychomycosis:<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |last2=Berger |first2=Timothy G. |display-authors=3}}</ref>
* [[Distal subungual onychomycosis]] is the most common form of ''tinea unguium'', and is usually caused by ''Trichophyton rubrum'',  which invades the [[Fingernail|nail bed]] and the underside of the [[nail plate]].
* [[White superficial onychomycosis]] (WSO) is caused by fungal invasion of the superficial layers of the nail plate to form "white islands" on the plate. It accounts for only 10 percent of onychomycosis cases.  In some cases, WSO is a misdiagnosis of "keratin granulations" which are not a fungus, but a reaction to nail polish that can cause the nails to have a chalky white appearance.  A laboratory test should be performed to confirm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmecorner.com/macmcm/aapa/aapa2004_05.htm |title=AAPA |publisher=Cmecorner.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref>
* [[Proximal subungual onychomycosis]] is fungal penetration of the newly formed nail plate through the proximal [[nail fold]].  It is the least common form of ''tinea unguium'' in healthy people, but is found more commonly when the patient is immunocompromised.
* [[Candidal onychomycosis]] is ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' species invasion of the fingernails, usually occurring in persons who frequently immerse their hands in water. This normally requires the prior damage of the nail by [[infection]] or [[Physical trauma|trauma]].

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Oncymycosis.JPG|thumb|Onychomycosis]]
The most common symptom of a fungal nail infection is the nail becoming thickened and discoloured: white, black, yellow or green. As the infection progresses the nail can become brittle, with pieces breaking off or coming away from the toe or finger completely. If left untreated, the skin can become inflamed and painful underneath and around the nail. There may also be white or yellow patches on the nailbed or scaly skin next to the nail.<ref name=nhs>[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Fungal-nail-infection/Pages/Symptoms.aspx NHS Choices: Symptoms of fungal nail infection]</ref> There is usually no pain or other bodily symptoms, unless the disease is severe.<ref>{{Emedicine|derm|300|Onychomycosis}}</ref> People with onychomycosis may experience significant [[psychosocial]] problems due to the appearance of the nail, particularly when fingers – which are always visible – rather than toenails are affected.<ref name="pmid18793262">{{cite journal |author=Szepietowski JC, Reich A |title=Stigmatisation in onychomycosis patients: a population-based study |journal=Mycoses |volume= 52|issue= 4|page= 343|year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18793262 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0507.2008.01618.x |url=}}</ref>

[[Dermatophytids]] are fungus-free [[skin lesions]] that sometimes form as a result of a fungus infection in another part of the body. This could take the form of a [[rash]] or [[itch]] in an area of the body that is not infected with the fungus. Dermatophytids can be thought of as an [[allergic reaction]] to the fungus.

==Causes==
The causative [[pathogens]] of onychomycosis include dermatophytes, ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'', and nondermatophytic [[mold]]s. Dermatophytes are the [[fungi]] most commonly responsible for onychomycosis in the temperate western countries; while ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' and nondermatophytic [[mold]]s are more frequently involved in the tropics and subtropics with a hot and humid climate.<ref name="pmid16262878">{{cite journal |author=Chi CC, Wang SH, Chou MC |title=The causative pathogens of onychomycosis in southern Taiwan |journal=Mycoses |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=413–20 |year=2005 |pmid=16262878 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0507.2005.01152.x}}</ref>

===Dermatophytes===
''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' is the most common [[dermatophyte]] involved in onychomycosis. Other dermatophytes that may be involved are ''[[Trichophyton interdigitale|T. interdigitale]]'', ''[[Epidermophyton floccosum]]'', ''T. violaceum'', ''[[Microsporum gypseum]]'', ''[[Trichophyton tonsurans|T. tonsurans]]'', ''[[Trichophyton soudanense|T. soudanense]]'' (considered by some to be an African variant of ''T. rubrum'' rather than a full-fledged separate [[species]]) and the [[cattle]] [[ringworm]] fungus ''[[Trichophyton verrucosum|T. verrucosum]]''.  A common outdated name that may still be reported by medical laboratories is ''[[Trichophyton mentagrophytes]]'' for ''T. interdigitale''.  The name ''T. mentagrophytes'' is now restricted to the agent of [[favus]] skin infection of the [[mouse]]; though this fungus may be transmitted from [[mice]] and their [[dander]]s to humans, it generally infects skin and not nails.

===Other===
Other causative [[pathogens]] include ''Candida'' and nondermatophytic [[mold]]s, in particular members of the mold generation  ''[[Scytalidium]]'' (name recently changed to ''[[Neoscytalidium]]''), ''[[Scopulariopsis]]'', and ''[[Aspergillus]]''.
''Candida'' spp. mainly cause fingernail onychomycosis in people whose hands are often submerged in water. ''Scytalidium'' mainly affects people in the [[tropics]], though it persists if they later move to areas of [[temperate climate]].

Other molds more commonly affect people older than 60 years, and their presence in the nail reflects a slight weakening in the nail's ability to defend itself against fungal invasion.

===Risk factors===
Aging is the most common risk factor for onychomycosis due to diminished blood circulation, longer exposure to fungi, and nails which grow more slowly and thicken, increasing susceptibility to infection. Nail fungus tends to affect men more often than women, and is associated with a family history of this infection

Other risk factors include [[Perspiration|perspiring]] heavily, being in a humid or moist environment, [[psoriasis]], wearing socks and shoes that hinder ventilation and do not absorb perspiration, going barefoot in damp public places such as swimming pools, gyms and shower rooms, having [[athlete's foot]] (tinea pedis), minor skin or nail injury, damaged nail, or other infection, and having diabetes, circulation problems, which may also lead to lower peripheral temperatures on hands and feet, or a weakened immune system.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nail-fungus/DS00084/DSECTION=risk-factors Mayo Clinic – Nail fungus – risk factors]</ref>

==Diagnosis==
To avoid misdiagnosis as [[Psoriatic nails|nail psoriasis]], [[lichen planus]], [[contact dermatitis]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], nail bed [[tumor]] or [[yellow nail syndrome]], laboratory confirmation may be necessary. The three main approaches are [[potassium hydroxide]] smear, [[Tissue culture|culture]] and [[histology]]. This involves [[microscopic]] examination and culture of nail scrapings or clippings. Recent results indicate the most sensitive diagnostic approaches are direct smear combined with histological examination,<ref name="pmid17222296">{{cite journal |author=Karimzadegan-Nia M; Mir-Amin-Mohammadi A; Bouzari N, Firooz A |title=Comparison of direct smear, culture and histology for the diagnosis of onychomycosis |journal=Australas.

==Treatment==
Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging because the infection is embedded within the nail and is difficult to reach; full removal of symptoms is slow and may take a year or more, since new nail growth must entirely replace old, infected growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nailfungus.me/treatment.html |title=Nail Fungus Treatment |accessdate=2013-01-05}}</ref>

===Pharmacological===
Most treatments are either systemic [[antifungals|antifungal]] medications, such as [[clotrimazole]], [[terbinafine]] and [[itraconazole]], or topical, such as nail paints containing [[ciclopirox]] (ciclopiroxolamine) or [[amorolfine]].  There is evidence that combining [[Systemic administration|systemic]] and [[topical]] treatments is beneficial.<ref name="pmid11237081">{{cite journal |author=Rodgers P, Bassler M |title=Treating onychomycosis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=663–72, 677–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11237081 |doi= |url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/20010215/663.html}}</ref>

For superficial white onychomycosis, systemic rather than topical antifungal therapy is advised.<ref name="pmid17610995">{{cite journal |author=Baran R, Faergemann J, Hay RJ |title=Superficial white onychomycosis—a syndrome with different fungal causes and paths of infection |journal=J.

In July 2007 a meta-study reported on clinical trials for [[topical]] treatments of fungal nail infections.  The study included six randomised, controlled trials dating up to March 2005.<ref name="pmid17636672">{{cite journal |author=Crawford F, Hollis S |title=Topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD001434 |year=2007 |pmid=17636672 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001434.pub2 |editor1-last=Crawford |editor1-first=Fay}}</ref>  The main findings are:
* There is some evidence ciclopiroxolamine and [[butenafine]] are both effective, but both need to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least 1 year).
* There is evidence topical ciclopiroxolamine has poor cure rates, and that amorolfine might be substantially more effective.
* Further research into the effectiveness of antifungal agents for nail infections is required.

A 2002 study compared the efficacy and safety of medication with terbinafine in comparison to [[placebo]], itraconazole and [[griseofulvin]] in treating fungal infections of the nails.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Haugh M, Helou S, Boissel JP, Cribier BJ |title=Terbinafine in fungal infections of the nails: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials |journal=Br.

Dermatol. |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=118–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12100193 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.2002.04825.x}}</ref>  The main findings were for reduced fungus, terbinafine was found to be significantly better than itraconazole and griseofulvin, and terbinafine was better tolerated than itraconazole.

* A small study in 2004 showed ciclopirox [[nail paint]] was more effective when combined with topical [[urea cream]].<ref>{{cite news

* A 2007 randomised clinical trial with 249 patients showed a combination of amorolfine [[nail lacquer]] and oral terbinafine enhanced clinical efficacy and is more cost-effective than terbinafine alone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baran R |title=A multicentre, randomized, controlled study of the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of a combination therapy with amorolfine nail lacquer and oral terbinafine compared with oral terbinafine alone for the treatment of onychomycosis with matrix involvement |journal= British Journal of Dermatology|volume= 157|issue= 1|year=2007 |pmid=17553051 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2007.07974.x |pages=149–57 |author-separator=, |author2=Sigurgeirsson B |author3=Berker DD |display-authors=3 |last4=Kaufmann |first4=R. |last5=Lecha |first5=M. |last6=Faergemann |first6=J. |last7=Kerrouche |first7=N. |last8=Sidou |first8=F.}}</ref>

=== Heat ===

Research suggests that fungi are sensitive to heat, typically 40–60 °C.  The basis of laser treatment is to try heat the nail bed to these temperatures in order to disrupt fungal growth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Device-based Therapies for Onychomycosis Treatment|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/772259_2|accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>

A Pinpointe type{{clarify|date=August 2012}} laser is available in the USA and approved by the [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00935649 FDA] for onychomycosis treatment.

A [[Noveon]]-type laser, already in use by [[physicians]] for some types of [[cataract]] [[surgery]] on the eye, is used by some podiatrists, although the only scientific study on its efficacy {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, while showing positive results, included far too few test subjects for the laser to be proven generally effective.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.japmaonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/100/3/166 |journal=Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=166–177 |year=2010 |title=Treatment of mild, moderate, and severe onychomycosis using 870- and 930-nm light exposure |first=Adam S. |last=Landsman |pmid=20479446 |display-authors=1 |last2=Robbins |first2=AH |last3=Angelini |first3=PF |last4=Wu |first4=CC |last5=Cook |first5=J |last6=Oster |first6=M |last7=Bornstein |first7=ES}}</ref>

In 2011 several lasers were submitted for approval and two been cleared by the [[Food and Drug Administration]].<ref>{{cite web

Several companies have approval to market a Nd:YAG laser for onychomycosis treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medica.de/cipp/md_medica/custom/pub/content,oid,34955/lang,2/ticket,g_u_e_s_t/~/Light_Age_Inc._receives_FDA_approval_for_the_treatment_of_onychomycosis.html |title=Light Age Inc. receives FDA approval for the treatment of onychomycosis – MEDICA Trade Fair |publisher=Medica.de |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>

The wavelength of light produced by the lasers trialled is in the visible or infra-red range, and insufficiently high to produce direct dna damage as would be the case with ultra-violet lasers.

If heating is an effective treatment, then there would be many other low technology, low cost methods available to raise the temperature of the nail bed, including infra-red heating, warm air heating etc.

===Nail removal with BILO methodology===

With the BILO methodology, the foot nails will be removed layer by layer. The patient can we walk home at the same day without any help, because there is no surgery, no blood, no pain. To prevent Onychomycosis to came back, the BILO methodology recommends some patient-specific gymnastics to improve blood circulation. The nail removal is well documented <ref>{{cite web |title=Foot nail removal by BILO methodology |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZlSgIFcrX0 |accessdate=2013-04-17}}</ref> and recognized by some health insurance organizations, but the gymnastics is outside of conventional medicine.

==Complications==
Nail fungus can be painful and cause permanent damage to nails. It may lead to other serious infections if the immune system is suppressed due to medication, diabetes or other conditions. The risk is most serious for people with diabetes and with immune systems weakened by leukaemia or AIDS, or medication after organ transplant. Diabetics have vascular and nerve impairment, and are at risk of [[cellulitis]], a potentially serious bacterial infection; any relatively minor injury to feet, including a nail fungal infection, can lead to more serious complications.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nail-fungus/DS00084/DSECTION=complications Mayo clinic – Nail fungus: complications]</ref> [[Osteomyelitis]] (infection of the bone) is another, rare, possible complication.<ref name=nhs/>
