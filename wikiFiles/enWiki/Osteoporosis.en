'''Osteoporosis''' ("porous bones", from Greek: οστούν/''ostoun'' meaning "bone" and πόρος/''poros'' meaning "pore") is a [[disease]] of [[bone]]s that leads to an increased risk of [[bone fracture|fracture]].<ref name=AppTher>{{cite book |author=Brian K Alldredge; Koda-Kimble, Mary Anne; Young, Lloyd Y.; Wayne A Kradjan; B. Joseph Guglielmo |title=Applied therapeutics: the clinical use of drugs |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2009 |pages=101–3 |isbn=0-7817-6555-2}}</ref> In osteoporosis, the [[bone mineral density]] (BMD) is reduced, bone microarchitecture deteriorates, and the amount and variety of proteins in bone are altered. Osteoporosis is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as a bone mineral density of 2.5 [[standard deviation]]s or more below the mean peak bone mass (average of young, healthy adults) as measured by [[dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]]; the term "established osteoporosis" includes the presence of a [[fragility fracture]].<ref name=WHO1994>{{cite journal |author=WHO |title=Assessment of fracture risk and its application to screening for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Report of a WHO Study Group |journal=World Health Organization technical report series |volume=843 |pages=1–129 |year=1994 |pmid=7941614 }}</ref> The disease may be classified as primary type 1, primary type 2, or secondary.<ref name=AppTher/>

The form of osteoporosis most common in women after [[menopause]] is referred to as primary type 1 or postmenopausal osteoporosis. Primary type 2 osteoporosis or [[senile osteoporosis]] occurs after age 75 and is seen in both females and males at a ratio of 2:1. Secondary osteoporosis may arise at any age and affect men and women equally. This form results from chronic predisposing medical problems or disease, or prolonged use of medications such as [[glucocorticoid]]s, when the disease is called steroid- or [[glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis]].

The risk of osteoporosis fractures can be reduced with lifestyle changes and in those with previous osteoporosis related fractures medications. Lifestyle change includes diet, exercise, and [[Fall prevention|preventing falls]]. The utility of [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] is questionable in most. [[Bisphosphonate]]s are useful in those with previous fractures from osteoporosis but are of minimal benefit in those who have osteoporosis but no previous fractures. Osteoporosis is a component of the [[frailty syndrome]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Osteoporosis itself has [[asymptomatic|no symptoms]]; its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures. Osteoporotic [[fractures]] occur in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone; they are therefore regarded as fragility fractures. Typical fragility fractures occur in the [[vertebral column]], [[rib]], hip and [[wrist]].

===Fractures===
Fractures are the most dangerous aspect of osteoporosis. Debilitating acute and chronic pain in the elderly is often attributed to fractures from osteoporosis and can lead to further disability and early mortality.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Old|first=JL|coauthors=Calvert, M|title=Vertebral compression fractures in the elderly|journal=American Family Physician|year=2004|volume=69|issue=1|pages=111–6|pmid=14727827|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0101/p111.html|accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref> These fractures may also be asymptomatic. The symptoms of a [[vertebra]]l collapse ("[[compression fracture]]") are sudden [[back pain]], often with [[radicular pain]] (shooting pain due to nerve root compression) and rarely with [[spinal cord compression]] or [[cauda equina syndrome]]. Multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture, loss of height, and chronic pain with resultant reduction in mobility.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kim DH, Vaccaro AR |title=Osteoporotic compression fractures of the spine; current options and considerations for treatment |journal=The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=479–87 |year=2006 |pmid=16934715 |doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2006.04.013}}</ref>

Fractures of the long bones acutely impair mobility and may require [[surgery]]. [[Hip fracture]], in particular, usually requires prompt surgery, as serious risks are associated with it, such as [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]], and increased mortality.

Fracture risk calculators assess the risk of fracture based upon several criteria, including [[BMD]], age, smoking, alcohol usage, weight, and gender. Recognized calculators include [[FRAX]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://courses.washington.edu/bonephys/FxRiskCalculator.html|title= Fracture Risk Calculator|author=Susan Ott |accessdate=2009-11-03 }}</ref> and Dubbo.

===Falls risk===

The increased risk of falling associated with aging leads to fractures of the wrist, spine, and hip. The risk of falling, in turn, is increased by impaired eyesight due to any cause (e.g. [[glaucoma]], [[macular degeneration]]), [[balance disorder]], [[movement disorder]]s (e.g. [[Parkinson's disease]]), [[dementia]], and [[sarcopenia]] (age-related loss of [[skeletal muscle]]). [[Collapse (medical)|Collapse]] (transient loss of postural tone with or without loss of consciousness) leads to a significant risk of falls; causes of syncope are manifold, but may include [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s (irregular heart beat), [[vasovagal syncope]], [[orthostatic hypotension]] (abnormal drop in blood pressure on standing up), and [[seizure]]s. Removal of obstacles and loose carpets in the living environment may substantially reduce falls. Those with previous falls, as well as those with gait or balance disorders, are most at risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ganz DA, Bao Y, Shekelle PG, Rubenstein LZ |title=Will my patient fall? |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=1 |pages=77–86 |year=2007 |pmid=17200478 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.1.77}}</ref>

==Risk factors==
Risk factors for osteoporotic fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication in specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk is unavoidable.
[[Caffeine]] is not a risk factor for osteoporosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Waugh|first=EJ|coauthors=Lam, MA, Hawker, GA, McGowan, J, Papaioannou, A, Cheung, AM, Hodsman, AB, Leslie, WD, Siminoski, K, Jamal, SA, Perimenopause BMD Guidelines Subcommittee of Osteoporosis, Canada|title=Risk factors for low bone mass in healthy 40–60 year old women: a systematic review of the literature|journal=Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA|date=2009 Jan|volume=20|issue=1|pages=1–21|pmid=18523710|doi=10.1007/s00198-008-0643-x}}</ref>

===Nonmodifiable===
The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age (in both men and women) and [[female]] sex; [[estrogen]] deficiency following menopause or oophorectomy is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density, while in men, a decrease in [[testosterone]] levels has a comparable (but less pronounced) effect. While osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups, [[European ethnic groups|European]] or [[Asian people|Asian]] ancestry predisposes for osteoporosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Melton LJ |title=Epidemiology worldwide |journal=Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=1–13, v |year=2003 |pmid=12699289 |doi=10.1016/S0889-8529(02)00061-0}}</ref> Those with a [[family history (medicine)|family history]] of fracture or osteoporosis are at an increased risk; the [[heritability]] of the fracture, as well as low bone mineral density, are relatively high, ranging from 25 to 80%. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis.<ref name=Raisz/> Those who have already had a fracture are at least twice as likely to have another fracture compared to someone of the same age and sex.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ojo F, Al Snih S, Ray LA, Raji MA, Markides KS |title=History of fractures as predictor of subsequent hip and nonhip fractures among older Mexican Americans |journal=Journal of the National Medical Association |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=412–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17444431 |pmc=2569658}}</ref> A small stature is also a nonmodifiable risk factor associated with the development of osteoporosis.<ref name=AppTher/>

===Potentially modifiable===
* Excess [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]: Although small amounts of alcohol are probably beneficial (bone density increases with increasing alcohol intake), chronic heavy drinking (alcohol intake greater than three units/day) probably increases fracture risk despite any beneficial effects on bone density.<ref name="BMJosteoporosis">{{cite journal |author=Poole KE, Compston JE |title=Osteoporosis and its management |journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7581 |pages=1251–6 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17170416 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39050.597350.47 |pmc=1702459}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Berg KM, Kunins HV, Jackson JL ''et al.'' | title= Association between alcohol consumption and both osteoporotic fracture and bone density | journal=Am J Med | year=2008 | volume=121 | issue=5 | pages=406–18 | doi= 10.1016/j.amjmed.2007.12.012 | pmid=18456037 | pmc=2692368}}</ref>

A positive association exists between serum [[1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol]] levels and bone mineral density, while PTH is negatively associated with bone mineral density.<ref name="WHOcriteria"/>
* [[Tobacco smoking]]: Many studies have associated smoking with decreased bone health, but the mechanisms are unclear. Tobacco smoking has been proposed to inhibit the activity of osteoblasts, and is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis.<ref name="BMJosteoporosis"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wong PK, Christie JJ, Wark JD |title=The effects of smoking on bone health |journal=Clin.

* [[Malnutrition]]: Nutrition has an important and complex role in maintenance of good bone. Identified risk factors include low dietary [[calcium]] and/or phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, boron, iron, fluoride, copper, vitamins A, K, E and C (and D where skin exposure to sunlight provides an inadequate supply). Excess sodium is a risk factor. High blood acidity may be diet-related, and is a known antagonist of bone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jasminka Z.

* Endurance training: In female endurance athletes, large volumes of training can lead to decreased bone density and an increased risk of osteoporosis.<ref>{{Cite pmid|20975110}}</ref> This effect might be caused by intense training suppressing menstruation, producing [[amenorrhea]], and it is part of the [[female athlete triad]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|15048548}}</ref> However, for male athletes, the situation is less clear, and although some studies have reported low bone density in elite male endurance athletes,<ref>{{Cite pmid|8370698}}</ref> others have instead seen increased leg bone density.<ref>{{Cite pmid|9383270}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|10953900}}</ref>
* [[Heavy metals]]: A strong association between [[cadmium]] and lead with bone disease has been established. Low-level exposure to cadmium is associated with an increased loss of bone mineral density readily in both genders, leading to pain and increased risk of fractures, especially in the elderly and in females. Higher cadmium exposure results in [[osteomalacia]] (softening of the bone).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Staessen J, Roels H, Emelianov D, Kuznetsova T, Thijs L, Vangronsveld J, Fagard R | title = Environmental exposure to cadmium, forearm bone density, and risk of fractures: prospective population study.

===Medical disorders===
Many diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis.<ref name=ICSI>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070718014056/http://www.icsi.org/osteoporosis/diagnosis_and_treatment_of_osteoporosis__3.html |title=ICSI Health Care Guideline: Diagnosis and Treatment of Osteoporosis, 5th edition |accessdate=2008-04-08 |author=Simonelli, C ''et al.'' |month=July|year=2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement}}</ref> For some, the underlying mechanism influencing the bone metabolism is straightforward, whereas for others the causes are multiple or unknown.
* In general, [[immobilization]] causes bone loss (following the 'use it or lose it' rule). For example, localized osteoporosis can occur after prolonged immobilization of a fractured limb in a cast. This is also more common in active patients with a high bone turn-over (for example, athletes). Other examples include bone loss during [[space flight]] or in people who are bedridden or use wheelchairs for various reasons.
* [[Hypogonadism|Hypogonadal]] states can cause secondary osteoporosis. These include [[Turner syndrome]], [[Klinefelter syndrome]], [[Kallmann syndrome]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[andropause]],<ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'/> [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] amenorrhea or [[hyperprolactinemia]].<ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'/> In females, the effect of hypogonadism is mediated by estrogen deficiency. It can appear as early menopause (<45 years) or from prolonged premenopausal amenorrhea (>1 year). Bilateral [[oophorectomy]] (surgical removal of the ovaries) and [[premature ovarian failure]] cause deficient estrogen production. In males, testosterone deficiency is the cause (for example, andropause or after surgical removal of the [[testes]]).
* Endocrine disorders that can induce bone loss include [[Cushing's syndrome]],<ref name="WHOcriteria"/> [[hyperparathyroidism]],<ref name="WHOcriteria"/> [[thyrotoxicosis]],<ref name="WHOcriteria"/> [[hypothyroidism]], [[diabetes mellitus]] type 1 and 2,<ref name=OsteoporosisMen>{{cite journal|author=Ebeling PR|title=Clinical practice.

Those with an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop osteoporosis due to the inability to absorb calcium and/or vitamin D. Other micronutrients such as [[vitamin K]] or [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]] may also contribute.
* Patients with rheumatologic disorders such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]],<ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'/> [[ankylosing spondylitis]],<ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/330598-overview |title=Osteoporosis – Risk Factors, Screening, and Treatment |accessdate=2008-05-11 |last=Kohlmeier |first=Lynn Kohlmeier |year=1998 |publisher=Medscape Portals }}</ref> [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] and polyarticular [[juvenile idiopathic arthritis]] are at increased risk of osteoporosis, either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors (notably corticosteroid therapy). Systemic diseases such as [[amyloidosis]] and [[sarcoidosis]] can also lead to osteoporosis.
* [[Renal insufficiency]] can lead to [[osteodystrophy]].
* Hematologic disorders linked to osteoporosis are [[multiple myeloma]]<ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'/> and other [[monoclonal gammopathy|monoclonal gammopathies]],<ref name=OsteoporosisMen/> [[lymphoma]] and [[leukemia]], [[mastocytosis]],<ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'/> [[hemophilia]], [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[thalassemia]].
* Several inherited disorders have been linked to osteoporosis. These include [[osteogenesis imperfecta]],<ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'/> [[Marfan syndrome]],<ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'/> [[hemochromatosis]],<ref name="WHOcriteria"/> [[hypophosphatasia]], [[glycogen storage disease]]s, [[homocystinuria]],<ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'/> [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]],<ref name='medscapeosteoporosis'/> [[porphyria]], [[Menkes disease|Menkes' syndrome]], [[epidermolysis bullosa]] and [[Gaucher's disease]].
* People with [[scoliosis]] [[idiopathic|of unknown cause]] also have a higher risk of osteoporosis. Bone loss can be a feature of [[complex regional pain syndrome]]. It is also more frequent in people with Parkinson's disease and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].

===Medication===
Certain medications have been associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk; only steroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated, but evidence is emerging with regard to other drugs.
* [[Steroid-induced osteoporosis]] (SIOP) arises due to use of glucocorticoids – analogous to Cushing's syndrome and involving mainly the axial skeleton. The synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug [[prednisone]] is a main candidate after prolonged intake. Some professional guidelines recommend prophylaxis in patients who take the equivalent of more than 30&nbsp;mg hydrocortisone (7.5&nbsp;mg of prednisolone), especially when this is in excess of three months.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bone and Tooth Society of Great Britain, [[National Osteoporosis Society]], Royal College of Physicians |title=Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis |year=2003 |publisher=Royal College of Physicians of London |location=London, UK |isbn=1-86016-173-1 | url=http://bookshop.rcplondon.ac.uk/contents/pub89-a953a6c0-06c0-46d8-b79a-e951536d9070.pdf}}</ref> Alternate day use may not prevent this complication.<ref name=GIOP>{{cite journal|author=Gourlay M, Franceschini N, Sheyn Y| title=Prevention and treatment strategies for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporotic fractures |journal=Clin Rheumatol| year=2007|volume=26|issue=2|pages=144–53|pmid=16670825 |doi=10.1007/s10067-006-0315-1}}</ref>

The underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between [[bone resorption]] and [[Bone development|bone formation]]. In normal bone, [[matrix (biology)|matrix]] remodeling of bone is constant; up to 10% of all bone mass may be undergoing remodeling at any point in time. The process takes place in bone multicellular units (BMUs) as first described by Frost in 1963.<ref>Frost HM, Thomas CC. Bone Remodeling Dynamics. Springfield, IL: 1963.</ref> Bone is resorbed by [[osteoclast]] cells (which derive from the [[bone marrow]]), after which new bone is deposited by [[osteoblast]] cells.<ref name=Raisz>{{cite journal | author = Raisz L | title = Pathogenesis of osteoporosis: concepts, conflicts, and prospects | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 115 | issue = 12 | pages = 3318–25 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16322775 | url=http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/115/12/3318 | doi=10.1172/JCI27071 | pmc = 1297264}}</ref>

The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling. An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue.<ref name=Raisz/> Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. as a result of menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the [[uterus]] and [[Mammary gland|breast gland]]. The α-form of the [[estrogen receptor]] appears to be the most important in regulating bone turnover.<ref name=Raisz/> In addition to estrogen, [[calcium metabolism]] plays a significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the [[parathyroid gland]]s react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of [[calcitonin]], a hormone generated by the [[thyroid]] that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.<ref name=Raisz/>
[[Image:Active osteoblasts.jpg|thumb|Osteoblasts, several displaying a prominent Golgi apparatus, actively synthesizing osteoid containing two osteocytes.]]

The activation of osteoclasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which the receptor activator for [[NF-κB|nuclear factor κB]] ligand ([[RANKL]]) is one of best studied. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. [[lymphocyte]]s), and stimulates [[RANK]] (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB). [[Osteoprotegerin]] (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. RANKL, RANK and OPG are closely related to [[tumor necrosis factor]] and its receptors. The role of the [[Wnt signaling pathway]] is recognized, but less well understood. Local production of [[eicosanoid]]s and [[interleukin]]s is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover, and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis.<ref name=Raisz/>

[[Trabecular bone]] (or cancellous bone) is the sponge-like bone in the ends of long bones and vertebrae. [[Cortical bone]] is the hard outer shell of bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones, trabecular bone is more active, and is more subject to bone turnover and remodeling. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular bone break ("microcracks"), and are replaced by weaker bone. Common osteoporotic fracture sites, the wrist, the hip and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These areas rely on trabecular bone for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Around the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.<ref name=AppTher />

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:L1 2 vertebral fracture.jpg|thumb|Multiple osteoporotic wedge fractures demonstrated on a lateral thoraco-lumbar spine X-ray]]

The diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made using conventional radiography and by measuring the bone mineral density (BMD).<ref name="diagnosticimaging.com">{{cite journal|author=Guglielmi G, Scalzo G. |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/display/article/113619/1565165 |title=Imaging tools transform diagnosis of osteoporosis|journal=Diagnostic Imaging Europe|date=May 6, 2010|volume=26|pages=7–11}}</ref> The most popular method of measuring BMD is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. In addition to the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes; this may be done with [[blood tests]]. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem, investigations for [[cancer]] with [[metastasis]] to the bone, multiple myeloma, [[Cushing's disease]] and other above-mentioned causes may be performed.

===Conventional radiography===
Conventional radiography is useful, both by itself and in conjunction with CT or MRI, for detecting complications of [[osteopenia]] (reduced bone mass; preosteoporosis), such as fractures; for differential diagnosis of osteopenia; or for follow-up examinations in specific clinical settings, such as soft tissue calcifications, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteomalacia in renal osteodystrophy. However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images.

The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. Vertebral height measurements can objectively be made using plain-film X-rays by using several methods such as height loss together with area reduction, particularly when looking at vertical deformity in T4-L4, or by determining a spinal fracture index that takes into account the number of vertebrae involved. Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine, leading to what is known as [[hyperkyphosis|dowager's hump]].

===Dual-energy X-ray===
[[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DXA) is considered the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the [[bone density|bone mineral density]] is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young (30–40-year-old<ref name="WHOcriteria"/><sup>:58</sup>), healthy adult women reference population. This is translated as a [[Bone density#T-score|T-score]]. But because bone density decreases with age, more people become osteoporotic with increasing age.<ref name="WHOcriteria"/><sup>:58</sup> The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines:<ref name=WHO1994/><ref name="WHOcriteria">{{cite web | author=WHO Scientific Group on the Prevention and Management of Osteoporosis (2000 : Geneva, Switzerland) |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_921.pdf |title=Prevention and management of osteoporosis : report of a WHO scientific group| year=2003 |accessdate=2007-05-31 |format=PDF }}</ref>

The International Society for Clinical Densitometry takes the position that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone. It also states, for premenopausal women, Z-scores (comparison with age group rather than peak bone mass) rather than T-scores should be used, and the diagnosis of osteoporosis in such women also should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone.<ref name="pmid14742881">{{cite journal |author=Leib ES, Lewiecki EM, Binkley N, Hamdy RC |title=Official positions of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry |journal=J Clin Densitom |volume=7 |issue=1 | year=2004 |pmid=14742881 | doi=10.1385/JCD:7:1:1 |pages=1–5}} quoted in: [http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&doc_id=6567&nbr=4129 "Diagnosis of osteoporosis in men, premenopausal women, and children"]</ref>

===Biomarkers===
Chemical [[biomarkers]] are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation. The enzyme cathepsin K breaks down type-I collagen protein, an important constituent in bones. Prepared antibodies can recognize the resulting fragment, called a neoepitope, as a way to diagnose osteoporosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yasuda|first=Y|coauthors=Kaleta K, Brömme D|title=The role of cathepsins in osteoporosis and arthritis: Rationale for the design of new therapeutics|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|year=2005|volume=57|issue=7|pages=973–993|pmid=15876399|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2004.12.013}}</ref> Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarker for osteoporosis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meunier|first=Pierre|title=Osteoporosis: Diagnosis and Management|year=1998|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|isbn=1-85317-412-2}}</ref>

===Other measuring tools===
[[Quantitative computed tomography]] differs from DXA in that it gives separate estimates of BMD for trabecular and cortical bone and reports precise volumetric mineral density in mg/cm<sup>3</sup> rather than BMD's relative Z score. Among QCT's advantages: it can be performed at axial and peripheral sites, can be calculated from existing CT scans without a separate radiation dose, is sensitive to change over time, can analyze a region of any size or shape, excludes irrelevant tissue such as fat, muscle, and air, and does not require knowledge of the patient's subpopulation in order to create a clinical score (e.g. the Z-score of all females of a certain age). Among QCT's disadvantages: it requires a high radiation dose compared to DXA, CT scanners are large and expensive, and because its practice has been less standardized than BMD, its results are more operator-dependent. Peripheral QCT has been introduced to improve upon the limitations of DXA and QCT.<ref name="diagnosticimaging.com"/>

Quantitative [[ultrasound]] has many advantages in assessing osteoporosis. The modality is small, no ionizing radiation is involved, measurements can be made quickly and easily, and the cost of the device is low compared with DXA and QCT devices. The calcaneus is the most common skeletal site for quantitative ultrasound assessment because it has a high percentage of trabecular bone that is replaced more often than cortical bone, providing early evidence of metabolic change. Also, the calcaneus is fairly flat and parallel, reducing repositioning errors. The method can be applied to children, neonates, and preterm infants, just as well as to adults. Once microimaging tools to examine specific aspects of bone quality are developed, it is expected that quantitative ultrasound will be increasingly used in clinical practice.<ref name="diagnosticimaging.com"/>

Although osteoporosis patients have an increased mortality rate due to the complications of fracture, it is rarely lethal.

Hip fractures can lead to decreased mobility and additional risks of numerous complications (such as [[deep venous thrombosis]] and/or pulmonary embolism, and [[pneumonia]]). The six-month mortality rate following hip fracture is around 13.5%, and a substantial proportion (almost 13%) of people who have suffered a hip fracture need total assistance to mobilize after a hip fracture.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hannan EL, Magaziner J, Wang JJ, ''et al.'' |title=Mortality and locomotion 6 months after hospitalization for hip fracture: risk factors and risk-adjusted hospital outcomes |journal=JAMA |volume=285 |issue=21 |pages=2736–42 |year=2001 |pmid=11386929| doi = 10.1001/jama.285.21.2736}}</ref>

Vertebral fractures, while having a smaller impact on mortality, can lead to severe chronic pain of neurogenic origin, which can be hard to control, as well as deformity. Though rare, multiple vertebral fractures can lead to such severe hunch back ([[kyphosis]]), the resulting pressure on internal organs can impair one's ability to breathe.

Apart from risk of death and other complications, osteoporotic fractures are associated with a reduced health-related [[quality of life]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brenneman SK, Barrett-Connor E, Sajjan S, Markson LE, Siris ES |title=Impact of recent fracture on health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women |journal=J.

===Vertebral fractures===

Between 35 and 50% of all women over 50 had at least one [[vertebral fracture]]. In the United States, 700,000 vertebral fractures occur annually, but only about a third are recognized. In a series of 9704 women aged 68.8 on average studied for 15 years, 324 had already suffered a vertebral fracture at entry into the study and 18.2% developed a vertebral fracture, but that risk rose to 41.4% in women who had a previous vertebral fracture.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cauley JA, Hochberg MC, Lui LY ''et al.'' | year=2007 | title=Long-term Risk of Incident Vertebral Fractures |journal = JAMA |volume =298|pages=2761–67|doi= 10.1001/jama.298.23.2761 | pmid=18165669 | issue = 23}}</ref>

===Wrist===
In the United States, 250,000 [[Distal radius fracture|wrist fractures]] annually are attributable to osteoporosis.<ref name=RiggsEtAl2005/> Wrist fractures are the third most common type of osteoporotic fractures. The lifetime risk of sustaining a Colles' fracture is about 16% for white women. By the time women reach age 70, about 20% have had at least one wrist fracture.<ref name='Merkepid'>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/diseasemodules/osteoporosis/epidemiology.jsp |title=MerckMedicus Modules: Osteoporosis – Epidemiology |accessdate=2008-06-13 |publisher=Merck & Co., Inc |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071228030929/http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/diseasemodules/osteoporosis/epidemiology.jsp |archivedate = 2007-12-28}}</ref>

===Rib fractures===
Fragility fractures of the ribs are common in men as young as age 35. These are often overlooked as signs of osteoporosis, as these men are often physically active and suffer the fracture in the course of physical activity. An example would be as a result of falling while water skiing or jet skiing. However, a quick test of the individual's testosterone level following the diagnosis of the fracture will readily reveal whether that individual might be at risk.

==History==
The link between age-related reductions in bone density and fracture risk goes back at least to [[Astley Cooper]], and the term "osteoporosis" and recognition of its pathological appearance is generally attributed to the French pathologist [[Jean Lobstein]].<ref>Lobstein JGCFM. ''Lehrbuch der pathologischen Anatomie.'' Stuttgart: Bd II, 1835.</ref> The American endocrinologist [[Fuller Albright]] linked osteoporosis with the postmenopausal state.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Albright F, Bloomberg E, Smith PH |year=1940 |title= Postmenopausal osteoporosis |journal=Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians. |volume=55 |pages=298–305}}</ref> Bisphosponates, which revolutionized the treatment of osteoporosis, were discovered in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patlak M |title=Bone builders: the discoveries behind preventing and treating osteoporosis |journal=FASEB J. |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1677E–E |year=2001 |pmid=11481214 |doi= 10.1096/fj.15.10.1677e}}</ref>
