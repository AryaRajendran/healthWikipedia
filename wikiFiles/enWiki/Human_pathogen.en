A '''human pathogen''' is a [[pathogen]] ([[microbe]] or [[microorganism]] such as a [[virus]], [[bacterium]], [[prion]], or [[fungus]])  that causes [[disease]] in [[human]]s.

The human physiological defense against common pathogens (such as ''[[Pneumocystis]]'') is mainly the responsibility of the  [[immune system]] with help by some of the body's normal [[Human microbiome|flora and fauna]]. However, if the immune system or "good" microbiota are damaged in any way (such as by [[chemotherapy]], [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), or [[antibiotic]]s being taken to kill other pathogens), pathogenic [[bacteria]] that were being held at bay can proliferate and cause harm to the host. Such cases are called [[opportunistic infection]]. 

Some pathogens (such as the bacterium ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', which may have caused the [[Black Plague]], the ''[[Variola]]'' virus, and the [[Malaria]] protozoa) have been responsible for massive numbers of casualties and have had numerous effects on afflicted groups. Of particular note in modern times is HIV, which is known to have infected several million humans globally, along with the [[Influenza]] virus. Today, while many medical advances have been made to safeguard against infection by pathogens, through the use of [[vaccination]], [[antibiotics]], and [[fungicide]], pathogens continue to threaten human life. Social advances such as [[food safety]], [[hygiene]], and [[water treatment]] have reduced the threat from some pathogens.

==Types==
===Viral===
{{Further|Viral disease}}
Pathogenic viruses are mainly those of the families of: [[Adenoviridae]],  bacteria [[Picornaviridae]], [[Herpesviridae]], [[Hepadnaviridae]], [[Flaviviridae]], [[Retroviridae]], [[Orthomyxoviridae]], [[Paramyxoviridae]], [[Papovaviridae]], [[Polyomavirus]], [[Rhabdoviridae]], [[Togaviridae]]. Some notable pathogenic viruses cause smallpox, influenza, [[mumps]], [[measles]], [[chickenpox]], [[ebola]], and rubella. Viruses typically range between 20-300 nanometers in length.

===Bacterial===
{{Main|Pathogenic bacteria}}
Although the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial to ones body, a few pathogenic bacteria can cause [[infectious disease]]s. The most common bacterial disease is [[tuberculosis]], caused by the bacterium ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', which affects just about 2 million people mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases, such as [[pneumonia]], which can be caused by bacteria such as ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', and foodborne illnesses, which can be caused by bacteria such as ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]''. Pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as [[tetanus]], [[typhoid fever]], [[diphtheria]], [[syphilis]] and [[Hansen's disease]]. Bacteria can often be killed by antibiotics because the cell wall in the outside is destroyed and then the DNA. They typically range between 1 and 5 micrometers in length.

===Fungal===
{{Main|Pathogenic fungi}}
Fungi comprise a eukaryotic kingdom of microbes that are usually [[saprophyte]]s but can cause diseases in humans. Life threatening fungal infections in humans most often occur in immunocompromised patients or vulnerable people with a weakened immune system, although fungi are common problems in the immunocompetent population as the causative agents of skin, nail or yeast infections. Most antibiotics that function on bacterial pathogens cannot be used to treat fungal infections because fungi and their hosts both have eukaryotic cells. Most clinical fungicides belong to the [[Azole|azole group]]. The typical fungal spore size is 1-40 micrometer in length.

===Other parasites===
{{main|Human parasites}}
Some eukaryotic organisms, such as [[protists]] and [[helminths]], cause disease. One of the best known diseases caused by protists in the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]'' is [[malaria]]. These can range from 3-200 micrometers in length.

===Prionic===
{{Main|Prion}}
Prions are infectious pathogens that do not contain [[nucleic acid]]s. Prions are abnormal proteins whose presence causes some diseases such as [[scrapie]], [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease) and [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]].<ref>[http://www.mad-cow.org/~tom/prionSP.html ''The prion diseases''] STANLEY B. PRUSINER, Scientific American</ref> The discovery of prion as a new class of pathogen led [[Stanley B. Prusiner]] to receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1997.

===Animal pathogens===
Animal pathogens are disease-causing agents of wild and domestic animal species, at times including humans.<ref>Encyclopedia of Biological Invasions - Page 510 Daniel Simberloff, Marcel Rejmánek - 2011 "'''Pathogens, animal''' Graham J. Hickling University of Tennessee, Knoxville "Animal pathogens are disease-causing agents of wild and domestic animal species, at times including humans. In the context of invasion biology, the term usually .."</ref>

==Virulence==
[[Virulence]] (the tendency of a pathogen to cause damage to a host's [[Physical fitness|fitness]]) evolves when that pathogen can spread from a diseased host, despite that host being very debilitated.  An example is the malaria parasite which can spread from a person near death, by hitching a ride to a healthy person on a mosquito that has bitten the diseased person.  This is called [[horizontal transmission]] in contrast to [[vertical transmission]], which tends to evolve symbiosis (after a period of high morbidity and mortality in the population) by linking the pathogen's evolutionary success to the evolutionary success of the host organism.

[[Evolutionary medicine]] has found that under horizontal transmission, [[Optimal virulence|the host population might never develop tolerance to the pathogen]].

==Transmission==
{{main|Transmission (medicine)}}
Transmission of pathogens occurs through many different routes, including airborne, direct or indirect contact, sexual contact, through blood, breast milk, or other body fluids, and through the fecal-oral route. One of the primary pathways by which food or water become contaminated is from the release of untreated sewage into a [[drinking water]] supply or onto cropland, with the result that people who eat or drink contaminated sources become infected. In [[developing countries]] most sewage is discharged into the environment or on cropland; even in [[developed countries]] there are periodic system failures resulting in a [[sanitary sewer overflow]].

==Examples==
*''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' &mdash; the causative agent of [[anthrax]] in humans and animals.
*''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' &mdash; releases the most powerful [[neurotoxin]] leading to death from [[botulism]].
* ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' &mdash; the causative agent of most cases of [[tuberculosis]]
* ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]'' &mdash; the bacterium that causes [[leprosy]] (Hansen's disease)
* ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' &mdash; [[pneumonic plague|pneumonic]], [[septicemic plague|septicemic]], and the notorious [[bubonic plague|bubonic]] plagues (aka "[[Black Death]]")
* ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' &mdash; the etiologic agent of [[epidemic typhus|typhus fever]]
* ''[[Bartonella]]'' spp.
* [[Spanish influenza]] virus
