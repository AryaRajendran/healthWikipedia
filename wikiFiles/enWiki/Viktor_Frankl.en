His best-selling book ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' (published under a different title in 1959: ''From Death-Camp to Existentialism'', and originally published in 1946 as ''Trotzdem Ja Zum Leben Sagen: Ein Psychologe erlebt das Konzentrationslager'') chronicles his experiences as a [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]] inmate which led him to discover the importance of finding meaning in all forms of existence, even the most sordid ones, and thus a reason to continue living. Frankl became one of the key figures in [[existential therapy]] and a prominent source of inspiration for [[humanistic psychology|humanistic psychologists]].<ref name="Redsand2006">{{cite book|author=Anna Redsand|title=Viktor Frankl: A Life Worth Living|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3AXDwL6HwRAC|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=18 December 2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-618-72343-0}}</ref>

==Life before 1945==
Frankl was born in Vienna into a Jewish family of civil servants (''Beamtenfamilie''). His interest in psychology surfaced early. For the final exam ([[Matura]]) in [[Gymnasium (school)|''Gymnasium'']], he wrote a paper on the psychology of philosophical thinking. After graduating from ''Gymnasium'' in 1923, he studied medicine at the [[University of Vienna]] and later specialized in neurology and psychiatry, concentrating on the topics of depression and suicide. His early development was influenced by his contacts with [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]], although he would later diverge from their teachings.<ref name="Redsand2006" /><ref name="InstituteVienna">{{cite web|title=Viktor Fankl Life and Work|publisher=Viktor Frankl Institute Vienna|url=http://www.viktorfrankl.org/e/lifeandwork.html|year=2011|accessdate=May 2012}}</ref>

===Doctor, therapist===
During part of 1924 he became the president of the ''Sozialistische Mittelschüler Österreich'', a Social Democratic youth movement for high school students throughout Austria.<ref name="Frankl2000"/>{{rp|59}}

While still a medical student between 1928 and 1930, he organized and offered a special program to counsel high school students free of charge. The program involved the participation of psychologists such as Charlotte Buhler, and it paid special attention to students at the time when they received their report cards. In 1931, not a single Viennese student committed suicide. The success of this program grabbed the attention of the likes of [[Wilhelm Reich]] who invited him to Berlin.<ref name="Klingberg2001"/><ref name="InstituteVienna"/><ref name="Batthyany2010">{{cite book|author2=Viktor Emil Frankl|author1=Alexander Batthyany| title=The Feeling of Meaninglessness: A Challenge to Psychotherapy and Philosophy|chapter=Introduction: Viktor E.

From 1933 to 1937, Viktor Frankl completed his residency in neurology and psychiatry at the [[Steinhof (Vienna)|Steinhof Psychiatric Hospital]] in Vienna. He was responsible for the so-called ''Selbstmörderpavillon'', or "suicide pavilion". Here, he treated over 30,000 women prone to suicide.<ref name="Klingberg2001"/> In 1937, he established an independent private practice in neurology and psychiatry at Alser Strasse 32/12 in Vienna.<ref name="Klingberg2001"/>

Starting from the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938, he was prohibited from treating "[[Nazism and race|Aryan]]" patients due to his Jewish identity. In 1940 he started working at the [[Rothschild Hospital]], where he headed its neurological department. This hospital was the only one in Vienna to which Jews were still admitted. His medical opinions saved several patients from being euthanised via the [[Action T4|Nazi euthanasia program]]. In December 1941 he married Tilly Grosser.<ref name="Klingberg2001"/><ref name="Redsand2006" />

===Prisoner, therapist===
On 25 September 1942, Frankl, his wife and his parents were deported to the Nazi [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] Ghetto. There Frankl worked as a general practitioner in a clinic. When his skills in psychiatry were noticed, he was assigned to the psychiatric care ward in block B IV, establishing a camp service of "psychohygiene" or mental health care. He organized a unit to help newcomers to the camp overcome shock and grief. Later he set up a suicide watch, assisted by [[Regina Jonas]].<ref name="Klingberg2001"/><ref name=Kwiet1984>{{cite journal | last = Kwiet | first = Konrad | title = The Ultimate Refuge: Suicide in the Jewish Community under the Nazis | journal = Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 135–167 |year=1984 | url = | doi= 10.1093/leobaeck/29.1.135 }}</ref> On 29 July 1943, Frankl organized a closed event for the Scientific Society at Theresienstadt, and with the help of [[Leo Baeck]] he offered a series of open lectures, including "Sleep and Sleep Disturbances", "Body and Soul", "Medical Care of the Soul", "Psychology of Mountaineering", "How to keep my nerves healthy?", "Medical ministry", "Existential Problems in Psychotherapy", and "Social Psychotherapy".<ref name=Kwiet1984/> His father Gabriel died of pulmonary edema and pneumonia at Theresienstadt.<ref name="Klingberg2001"/><ref name="Redsand2006"/><ref name=Kwiet1984/>

On 19 October 1944, Frankl and his wife Tilly were transported to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], where he was processed. He was moved to [[Kaufering]], a Nazi concentration camp affiliated with [[Dachau concentration camp]], where he arrived on 25 October 1944. There he was to spend 5 months working as a slave laborer. In March 1945, he was offered to be moved to the so called rest-camp [[Türkheim]], also affiliated with Dachau. He decided to go to Türkheim, where he worked as a doctor until 27 April 1945, when Frankl was liberated by the Americans.<ref name="Klingberg2001"/><ref name="Redsand2006" />

Meanwhile, his wife Tilly was transferred from Auschwitz to the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where she died. Frankl's mother Elsa was killed by the Nazis in the gas chambers of Auschwitz, and his brother Walter died working in a mining operation that was part of Auschwitz. Apart from him, among Frankl's immediate relatives, the only survivor of the Holocaust was his sister Stella. She had escaped from Austria by emigrating to Australia.<ref name="Klingberg2001"/><ref name="Redsand2006" />

==Life after 1945==
Liberated after three years in concentration camps, Frankl returned to Vienna. During 1945 he wrote his world-famous book titled ''Trotzdem Ja Zum Leben Sagen: Ein Psychologe Erlebt das Konzentrationslager'' (translated: "...Saying Yes to Life in Spite of Everything: A Psychologist Experiences the Concentration Camp", known in English by the title ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' (1959). In this book, he described the life of an ordinary [[concentration camp]] inmate from the objective perspective of a psychiatrist.<ref name="Redsand2006" /><ref name="Frankl2006">{{cite book|author=Viktor Emil Frankl|title=Man's Search for Meaning|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F-Q_xGjWBi8C|accessdate=8 May 2012|date=1 June 2006|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-1427-1}}</ref>

After enduring the suffering in these camps, Frankl validated his hallmark conclusion that even in the most absurd, painful and dehumanized situation, life has potential meaning and that therefore even suffering is meaningful. This conclusion served as a strong basis for his [[logotherapy]] and [[Existential Therapy|existential analysis]], which Frankl had described before WWII.

An example of Frankl's idea of finding meaning in the midst of extreme suffering is found in his account of an experience he had while working in the harsh conditions of the Nazi's concentration camps: {{Quote|We stumbled on in the darkness, over big stones and through large puddles, along the one road leading from the camp. The accompanying guards kept shouting at us and driving us with the butts of their rifles. Anyone with very sore feet supported himself on his neighbor's arm. Hardly a word was spoken; the icy wind did not encourage talk. Hiding his mouth behind his upturned collar, the man marching next to me whispered suddenly: "If our wives could see us now! I do hope they are better off in their camps and don't know what is happening to us."

That brought thoughts of my own wife to mind. And as we stumbled on for miles, slipping on icy spots, supporting each other time and again, dragging one another up and onward, nothing was said, but we both knew: each of us was thinking of his wife. Occasionally I looked at the sky, where the stars were fading and the pink light of the morning was beginning to spread behind a dark bank of clouds. But my mind clung to my wife's image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness. I heard her answering me, saw her smile, her frank and encouraging look. Real or not, her look was then more luminous than the sun which was beginning to rise.

A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth – that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: ''The salvation of man is through love and in love.'' I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way—an honorable way—in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. For the first time in my life I was able to understand the meaning of the words, "The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory."<ref name="Frankl2006"/>{{rp|36–38}} }}

Frankl's concentration camp experiences thus shaped both his therapeutic approach and philosophical outlook, as reflected in his seminal publications. He often said that even within the narrow boundaries of the concentration camps he found only two races of men to exist: decent and unprincipled ones. These were to be found in all classes, ethnicities, and groups.<ref name="Frankl2006" />

In 1946 he was appointed to run the Vienna Polyclinic of Neurology. He remained there until 1971. In 1947 he married his second wife Eleonore Katharina Schwindt. She was a practicing Catholic and the couple respected each other's religious backgrounds, going to both church and synagogue, and celebrating Christmas and [[Hanukah]]. They had one daughter, Gabriele, who went on to become a child psychologist.<ref name="Klingberg2001"/><ref name="Redsand2006" /><ref name="Scully1995">{{cite news|last=Scully|first=Mathew|title=Viktor Frankl at Ninety: An Interview|work=First Things|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/08/004-viktor-frankl-at-ninety-an-interview-18|year=1995|accessdate=May 2012}}</ref>

In 1955 he was awarded a professorship of neurology and psychiatry at the [[University of Vienna]], and as visiting professor, he resided at [[Harvard University]] (1961), at [[Southern Methodist University]], Dallas (1966) and at [[Duquesne University]], Pittsburgh (1972).<ref name="InstituteVienna" /> He lectured and taught seminars all over the world and received 29 honorary doctoral degrees.<ref name="InstituteVienna" /><ref name="Scully1995"/> Frankl published 39 books, which were translated into as many as 40 languages.<ref name="InstituteVienna" />

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] awarded Frankl the 1985 [[Oskar Pfister Award]] for important contributions to religion and psychiatry.<ref name="Frankl2000">{{cite book|author=Frankl, Viktor|title=Man's search for ultimate meaning|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_hcQAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 May 2012|date=10 August 2000|publisher=Perseus Pub.|isbn=978-0-7382-0354-6}}</ref>

Frankl died of heart failure on 2 September 1997. He was survived by his wife Eleonore, his daughter Dr. Gabriele Frankl-Vesely, his grandchildren Katharina and Alexander, and his great-granddaughter Anna Viktoria.<ref name="dies at 92">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/04/world/dr-viktor-e-frankl-of-vienna-psychiatrist-of-the-search-for-meaning-dies-at-92.html|title=Dr. Viktor E.

==Legacy==
Frankl's [[logotherapy]] and [[existential therapy|existential analysis]] is considered the third Viennese School of Psychotherapy,<ref name="InstituteVienna" /> among the broad category that comprises [[existential therapy|existentialists]].<ref name="Yalom1980">{{Cite book| first= Irvin D.| last= Yalom| author-link= Irvin D. Yalom| title = Existential Psychotherapy| place= New York| publisher= BasicBooks| year= 1980| isbn= 0-465-02147-6}}</ref> For [[Irvin Yalom]], Frankl, "who has devoted his career to a study of an existential approach to therapy, has apparently concluded that the lack of meaning is ''the'' paramount existential stress. To him, existential neurosis is synonymous with a crisis of meaninglessness".<ref name="Yalom1980" />

He is thought to have coined the term ''Sunday neurosis''. The term refers to a form of anxiety resulting from an awareness in some people of the emptiness of their lives once the working week is over.<ref name="Boeree">{{cite web|last=Boeree|first=C. George|title=Viktor Frankl|publisher=Shippensburg University|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/frankl.html|year=2006|accessdate=7 March 2008}}</ref> Some complain of a void and a vague discontent.<ref name="Yalom1980" /> This arises from an existential vacuum, or feeling of meaninglessness, which is a common phenomenon and is characterised by the subjective state of boredom, apathy, and emptiness. One feels cynical, lacks direction and questions the point of most of life's activities.<ref name="Yalom1980"/>

Viktor Frankl once recommended that the [[Statue of Liberty]] on the [[East Coast of the United States]] be complemented by a [[Statue of Responsibility]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]:

{{quote|Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the [[Statue of Liberty]] on the East Coast be supplemented by a [[Statue of Responsibility]] on the West Coast.<ref name="Statueresponsibility">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/article_21e93a1f-94db-5533-9e5c-0560fff08972.html Statue of Responsibility|title=If freedom is to endure, liberty must be joined with responsibility.|last=Warnock|first=Caleb|date=May 8, 2005|work=Daily Herald|pages=A1|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}</ref>}}
