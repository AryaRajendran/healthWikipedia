The '''small saphenous vein''' (also '''short saphenous vein'''), is a relatively large [[vein]] of the superficial posterior [[leg]].  

==Path==
Its origin is where the dorsal vein from the [[fifth digit]] (smallest toe) merges with the [[dorsal venous arch of the foot]], which attaches to the [[great saphenous vein]].  It is a considered a [[superficial vein]] and is [[subcutaneous]] (just under the skin).  

From its origin, it courses around the lateral aspect of the foot (inferior and posterior to the [[lateral malleolus]]) and runs along the posterior aspect of the leg (with the [[sural nerve]]), passes between the heads of the [[gastrocnemius muscle]]. This vein presents a great number of variants concerning the point where it drains: 

Usually drains into the [[popliteal vein]] approximately at or above the level of the [[knee]] joint.

Is not rare to see the short saphenous vein joining the common gastrocnemius vein before drain in the popliteal vein.

Sometimes doesn't contact with the popliteal vein but go up to drain in the great saphenous vein at a variable level.

Instead draining in the popliteal vein it can merge with Giacomini's vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh.<ref>http://www.veinsurg.com/fr/biblio/echodoppler/echodoppler_15.php</ref>
