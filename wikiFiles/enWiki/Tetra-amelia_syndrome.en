'''Tetra-amelia syndrome''' (''[[wikt:tetra-|tetra-]]'' + ''[[amelia (birth defect)|amelia]]''), also called '''autosomal recessive tetraamelia''',<ref name=omim>{{OMIM|273395}}</ref> is a very rare [[autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]]<ref name=tar>{{cite pmid|14872406}}</ref> [[congenital disorder]] characterized by the absence of all four limbs. Other areas of the body are also affected by malformations, such as the face, skull, reproductive organs, anus and pelvis.<ref name=omim/> The disorder is caused by mutations in the [[WNT3]] gene.<ref name=tar/>

==Characteristics==
The syndrome causes severe malformations of various parts of the body, including the face and head, heart, nervous system, skeleton, and genitalia. In many cases, the lungs are underdeveloped, which makes breathing difficult or impossible. Because children with tetra-amelia syndrome have such serious medical problems, most are stillborn or die shortly after birth. Motivational speaker [[Nick Vujicic]] is one survivor of the syndrome and Japanese author and sports journalist [[Hirotada Ototake]] is another.

==Cause and genetics==

===The WNT3 Gene===
[[File:Autorecessive.jpg|thumb|right|Tetra-amelia syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[Biological_inheritance|inheritance]].]]
Researchers have found a mutation in the [[WNT3]] gene in people with tetra-amelia syndrome from one large family. This gene is part of a family of [[Wnt signaling pathway|WNT]] genes that play critical roles in development before birth. The WNT3 gene is located at human [[chromosome]] [[chromosome 17 (human)|17q21]].<ref>{{OMIM|165330}}</ref> 

The protein produced from the WNT3 gene is involved in the formation of the limbs and other body systems during embryonic development. Mutations in the WNT3 gene prevent cells from producing functional WNT3 protein, which disrupts normal limb formation and leads to the other serious birth defects associated with tetra-amelia syndrome.

===Genetics within families===
In some affected families, the cause of tetra-amelia syndrome has not been determined. Some researchers believe that unidentified mutations in WNT3 or other genes involved in limb development may be responsible for the disorder.
 
In most of the families reported so far, tetra-amelia syndrome appears to have an [[autosomal]] recessive pattern of inheritance.<ref name=omim/><ref name=tar/> This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an [[autosome]] (chromosome 17 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both [[genetic carrier|carry]] one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.

==Epidemiology==
{{expand section|date=May 2012}}
Tetra-amelia syndrome has been reported in only a few families worldwide. There are only eight known people in the world with tetra-amelia, one of whom resides in the [[Philippines]] and another in the [[UK]]. Another person living with the condition is [[Joanne O'Riordan]] of [[Millstreet]], [[Co. Cork|Cork]], [[Ireland]]. At the age of 16 she addressed the [[United Nations]] in New York. She appeared before the International Telecommunication Union’s conference ‘Girls in Technology’, receiving a standing ovation after delivering the keynote speech.
