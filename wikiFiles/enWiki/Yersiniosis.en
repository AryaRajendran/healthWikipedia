'''Yersiniosis''' is an [[infectious disease]] caused by a [[bacterium]] of the genus ''[[Yersinia]]''.  In the [[United States]], most yersiniosis infections among humans are caused by ''[[Y. enterocolitica]]''. Yersiniosis is mentioned as a specific zoonotic disease to prevent outbreaks in European Council Directive 92/117/EEC.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31992L0117:EN:HTML European Council Directive 92/117/EEC]</ref> It is also known as pseudotuberculosis.<ref name=Dictionary>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/medical_dictionary/ypsilon_yvon.html#yersiniosis |title=Yersiniosis |work=Medical Dictionary |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref>

Infection with ''Y. enterocolitica'' occurs most often in young children.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The infection is thought to be contracted through the consumption of undercooked meat products, unpasteurized milk, or water contaminated by the bacteria. It has been also sometimes associated with handling raw [[chitterling]]s.<ref name="pmid12967503">{{cite journal |author=Jones TF |title=From pig to pacifier: chitterling-associated yersiniosis outbreak among black infants |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=1007–9 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12967503 |pmc=3020614 |doi= |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no8/03-0103.htm}}</ref>

== Symptoms ==

Infection with ''Y. enterocolitica'' can cause a variety of [[symptom]]s depending on the age of the person infected, therefore it's often referred to as "monkey of diseases". Common symptoms in children are [[fever]], [[abdominal pain]], and [[diarrhea]], which is often bloody. Symptoms typically develop 4 to 7 days after exposure and may last 1 to 3 weeks or longer. In older children and adults, right-sided abdominal pain and fever may be the predominant symptoms, and may be confused with [[appendicitis]]. In a small proportion of cases, complications such as skin rash, joint pains, ileitis, erythema nodosum, and sometimes septicemia, acute arthritis<ref name=Dictionary></ref> or the spread of bacteria to the bloodstream ([[bacteremia]]) can occur.

==Treatment==

Treatment often requires aggressive antibiotic therapy, typically involving [[ciprofloxacin]], [[chloramphenicol]], [[ampicillin]], and [[polymyxin]].<ref name=Barron>

However, some gastoenterologists, especially in Scandinavia, consider antibiotic treatment mostly only when the patient has significant and persisting symptoms of [[gastroenteritis]]. [[Diarrhea]] caused by yersiniosis generally goes away on its own.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} 

In infants, however — particularly those who are 3 months old or younger — it can develop into a more serious condition called [[bacteremia]], an infection of the blood. Infants who contract yersiniosis are usually treated in a hospital.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
