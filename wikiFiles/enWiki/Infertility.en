'''Infertility''' primarily refers to the biological inability of a person to contribute to [[fertilization|conception]].  Infertility may also refer to the state of a woman who is unable to carry a pregnancy to [[full term]]. There are many biological causes of infertility, including some that medical intervention can treat.<ref name=pmid14569805>{{cite journal |author=Makar RS, Toth TL |title=The evaluation of infertility |journal=Am J Clin Pathol. |volume=117 |issue=Suppl |pages=S95–103 |year=2002 |pmid=14569805 }}</ref> Infertility has increased by 4 percent since the 1980s, mostly from problems with [[fecundity]] due to an increase in age.<ref>{{cite book|last=Maheshwari|first=A.|title=Human Reproduction|year=2008|Effect of female age on the diagnostic categories of infertility|pages=538–542}}</ref> About 40 percent of the issues involved with infertility are due to the man, another 40 percent due to the woman, and 20 percent result from complications with both partners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=B.|title=The infertile couple|year=1987|publisher=Churchill-Livingstone, Edinburgh}}</ref>

Women who are [[Fertility#Human fertility|fertile]] experience a natural period of fertility before and during [[ovulation]], and they are naturally infertile during the rest of the [[menstrual cycle]]. [[Fertility awareness]] methods are used to discern when these changes occur by tracking changes in cervical mucus or [[basal body temperature]].

==Definition==
Definitions of infertility differ, with demographers tending to define infertility as childlessness in a population of women of reproductive age, while the epidemiological definition is based on "trying for" or "time to" a pregnancy, generally in a population of women exposed to a probability of conception.<ref name="Doihumupddmr">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmr015 | title = Defining infertility--a systematic review of prevalence studies | year = 2011 | last1 = Gurunath | first1 = S. | last2 = Pandian | first2 = Z. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = R. A. | last4 = Bhattacharya | first4 = S. | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 575–88 | pmid = 21493634}}</ref> The time that needs to pass (during which the couple has tried to conceive) for that couple to be diagnosed with infertility differs between different jurisdictions. Existing definitions of infertility lack uniformity, rendering comparisons in prevalence between countries or over time problematic, and therefore data estimating the prevalence of infertility cited by various sources differs significantly.<ref name="Doihumupddmr" /> A couple that has tried unsuccessfully to have a child after a certain period of time (often a short period, but definitions vary) is sometimes said to be '''subfertile''', meaning less fertile than a typical couple. Both infertility and subfertility are defined as the inability to conceive after a certain period of time (the length of which vary), so often the two terms overlap.

===World Health Organization===
The World Health Organization defines infertility as follows:<ref>http://www.who.int/topics/infertility/en/</ref>

{{cquote|Infertility is the inability to conceive a child. A couple may be considered infertile if, after two years of regular sexual intercourse, without contraception, the woman has not become pregnant (and there is no other reason, such as breastfeeding or postpartum [[amenorrhoea]]). Primary infertility is infertility in a couple who have never had a child. Secondary infertility is failure to conceive following a previous pregnancy. Infertility may be caused by infection in the man or woman, but often there is no obvious underlying cause.}}

===United States===
One definition of infertility that is frequently used in the United States by reproductive endocrinologists, the doctors specializing in infertility, to consider a couple eligible for treatment is:
* a woman under 35 has not conceived after 12 months of contraceptive-free intercourse. Twelve months is the lower [[reference limit]] for ''Time to Pregnancy'' (TTP) by the World Health Organization.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cooper TG, Noonan E, von Eckardstein S, ''et al.'' |title=World Health Organization reference values for human semen characteristics |journal=Hum. Reprod. Update |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=231–45 |year=2010 |pmid=19934213 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmp048 |url=}}</ref>
* a woman over 35 has not conceived after 6 months of contraceptive-free [[sexual intercourse]].

These time intervals would seem to be reversed; this is an area where public policy trumps science. The idea is that for women beyond age 35, every month counts and if made to wait another 6 months to prove the necessity of medical intervention, the problem could become worse. The corollary to this is that, by definition, failure to conceive in women under 35 isn't regarded with the same urgency as it is in those over 35.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the NICE guidelines define infertility as failure to conceive after regular unprotected sexual intercourse for 2 years in the absence of known reproductive pathology.<ref name=nice>[http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG011publicinfoenglish.pdf] {{cite book |author= |title=Fertility: Assessment and Treatment for People with Fertility Problems |publisher=RCOG Press |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=1-900364-97-2 }}</ref>

===Other definitions===
Researchers commonly base demographic studies on infertility prevalence on a five-year period.<ref>http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/infertility/DHS-CR9.pdf</ref> Practical measurement problems, however, exist for any definition, because it is difficult to measure continuous exposure to the risk of pregnancy over a period of years.

===Primary vs. secondary infertility===
Couples with '''primary infertility''' have never been able to conceive,<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001191|Infertility}}</ref> while, on the other hand, '''secondary infertility''' is difficulty conceiving after already having conceived (and either carried the pregnancy to term or had a miscarriage). Secondary infertility is not present if there has been a change of partners (this follows tautologically from the convention of speaking of ''couples'', rather than individuals, as being infertile; if there is a change of partners, then a new couple is created, with its own chances to be infertile.)

==Prevalence==
Prevalence of infertility varies depending on the definition, i.e.
on the time span involved in the failure to conceive. 

*Some estimates suggest that worldwide "between three and seven per cent of all couples or women have an unresolved problem of infertility. Many more couples, however, experience involuntary childlessness for at least one year: estimates range from 12% to 28%." <ref>{{cite journal|last=Himmel|first=W.|title=Voluntary Childlessness and being Childfree|journal=British Journal of General Practice|year=1997|issue=415 |page=  |pmc=1312893|pmid=9101672|volume=47|last2=Ittner|first2=E|last3=Kochen|first3=MM|last4=Michelmann|first4=HW|last5=Hinney|first5=B|last6=Reuter|first6=M|last7=Kallerhoff|first7=M|last8=Ringert|first8=RH|pages=111–8}}</ref>

*Fertility problems affect one in seven couples in the UK. Most couples (about 84 out of every 100) who have regular [[sexual intercourse]] (that is, every two to three days) and who do not use contraception get pregnant within a year. About 92 out of 100 couples who are trying to get pregnant do so within two years.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/index.jsp?action=download&o=29271 NICE fertility guidance]</ref>
* Women become less fertile as they get older. For women aged 35, about 94 out of every 100 who have regular unprotected sexual intercourse get pregnant after three years of trying. For women aged 38, however, only 77 out of every 100 do so. The effect of age upon men's fertility is less clear.<ref name=autogenerated1/>
* In people going forward for IVF in the UK, roughly half of fertility problems with a diagnosed cause are due to problems with the man, and about half due to problems with the woman. However, about one in five cases of infertility has no clear diagnosed cause.<ref>[http://www.hfea.gov.uk/en/1215.html#Reasons_for_infertility HFEA Chart on reasons for infertility]</ref>
*In Britain, male factor infertility accounts for 25% of infertile couples, while 25% remain unexplained. 50% are female causes with 25% being due to [[anovulation]] and 25% tubal problems/other.<ref>{{cite book |author=Khan, Khalid; Janesh K. Gupta; Gary Mires |title=Core clinical cases in obstetrics and gynaecology: a problem-solving approach |publisher=Hodder Arnold |location=London |year=2005 |pages=152 |isbn=0-340-81672-4 }}</ref>
*In Sweden, approximately 10% of couples wanting children are infertile.<ref>Sahlgrenska University Hospital. (translated from the Swedish sentence: [http://sahlgrenska.se/upload/SU/omrade_oss/reproduktionsmedicin/Spermadonatorinformation.pdf "Cirka 10% av alla par har problem med ofrivillig barnlöshet."])</ref> In approximately one third of these cases the man is the factor, in one third the woman is the factor, and in the remaining third the infertility is a product of factors on both parts.

===Specific female causes===
{{Further|Female infertility}}
The following causes of infertility may only be found in females.
For a woman to conceive, certain things have to happen: intercourse must take place around the time when an egg is released from her ovary; the systems that produce eggs and sperm have to be working at optimum levels; and her hormones must be balanced.<ref>[http://www.hfea.gov.uk/en/802.html About infertility & fertility problems] from the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]].</ref>

For women, problems with [[fertilisation]] arise mainly from either structural problems in the [[Fallopian tube]] or uterus or problems releasing eggs. Infertility may be caused by blockage of the Fallopian tube due to malformations, infections such as [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]) and/or scar tissue. For example, [[Endometriosis]] can cause infertility with the growth of endometrial tissue in the Fallopian tubes and/or around the ovaries. Endometriosis is referred to as the "career women's disease" because it is usually more common in women in their mid-twenties and older, especially when postponed childbirth has taken place.<ref name="Lessey">Lessy, B.A. (2000) ''Medical management of endometriosis and infertility: 1089-1096.''</ref> 

Another major cause of infertility in women may be the inability to [[ovulate]]. Malformation of the eggs themselves may complicate conception.  For example, [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]] is when the eggs only partially developed within the ovary and there is an excess of male hormones. Some women are infertile because their ovaries do not mature and release eggs. In this case synthetic FSH by injection or Clomid (Clomiphene citrate) via a pill can be given to stimulate follicles to mature in the ovaries.

Other factors that can affect a woman's chances of conceiving include being over or underweight, or her age as female fertility declines sharply after the age of 35. Sometimes it can be a combination of factors, and sometimes a clear cause is never established.

Common causes of infertility of females include:
* ovulation problems (e.g. [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]], PCOS, the leading reason why women present to fertility clinics due to anovulatory infertility.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi =  10.1136/bmj.332.7539.434 | title =  Should obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome receive treatment for infertility? | year =  2006 | last1 =  Balen | first1 =  A.

* tubal blockage
* [[Pelvic inflammatory disease]]
* age-related factors
* uterine problems
* previous tubal ligation
* endometriosis
* [[advanced maternal age]]

===Specific male causes===
{{Further|Male infertility}}
The main cause of male infertility is low [[semen quality]]. In men who have the necessary reproductive organs to procreate, infertility can be caused by low sperm count due to endocrine problems, drugs, radiation, or infection.  There may be testicular malformations, hormone imbalance, or blockage of the man's duct system. Although many of these can be treated through surgery or hormonal substitutions, some may be more indefinite.<ref name="Mishail">Mishail, A., et al.(2009) ''Impact of a second semen analysis on a treatment decision making in the infertile man with [[varicocele]]: 1809-1811''</ref>
Infertility associated with viable, but immotile sperm may be caused by [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]].

===Combined infertility===
In some cases, both the man and woman may be infertile or sub-fertile, and the couple's infertility arises from the combination of these conditions. In other cases, the cause is suspected to be immunological or genetic; it may be that each partner is independently fertile but the couple cannot conceive together without assistance.

===Unexplained infertility===
{{Main|Unexplained infertility}}
In the US, up to 20% of infertile couples have unexplained infertility.<ref>[http://www.advancedfertility.com/unexplai.htm Unexplained Infertility Background, Tests and Treatment Options] Advanced Fertility Center of Chicago</ref> In these cases abnormalities are likely to be present but not detected by current methods. Possible problems could be that the egg is not released at the optimum time for fertilization, that it may not enter the fallopian tube, sperm may not be able to reach the egg, fertilization may fail to occur, transport of the zygote may be disturbed, or implantation fails. It is increasingly recognized that egg quality is of critical importance and women of advanced maternal age have eggs of reduced capacity for normal and successful fertilization. Also, [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] in [[folate pathway]] genes could be one reason for fertility complications in some women with unexplained infertility.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.02.025}}</ref>

==Assessment==
{{main|Fertility testing}}
If both partners are young and healthy and have been trying to conceive for one year without success, a visit to the family doctor could help to highlight potential medical problems earlier rather than later. The doctor may also be able to suggest lifestyle changes to increase the chances of conceiving.<ref>[http://www.hfea.gov.uk/en/804.html Infertility Help: When & where to get help for fertility treatment]</ref>

Women over the age of 35 should see their family doctor after six months as fertility tests can take some time to complete, and age may affect the treatment options that are open in that case.

A family doctor takes a medical history and gives a physical examination. They can also carry out some basic tests on both partners to see if there is an identifiable reason for not having achieved a pregnancy. If necessary, they refer patients to a fertility clinic or local hospital for more specialized tests. The results of these tests help determine the best fertility treatment.

==Treatment==<!-- This section is linked from [[Pro-choice]] -->
Treatment depends on the cause of infertility, but may include counselling, fertility treatments, which include in vitro fertilization. Treatment methods for infertility may be grouped as medical or complementary and alternative treatments. Some methods may be used in concert with other methods. Drugs used for women include Clomiphene citrate, Human menopausal gonadotropin, Follicle-stimulating hormone, Human chorionic gonadotropin, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, Aromatase inhibitor, Metformin.

=== At-home conception kit ===

In 2007 the FDA cleared the first at home tier one medical [[conception device]] to aid in conception. The key to the kit are cervical caps for conception. This at home [cervical cap] insemination method allows all the semen to be placed up against the cervical os for six hours allowing all available [[sperm]] to be placed directly on the [[cervical os]]. For low sperm count, low sperm motility, or a tilted cervix using a cervical cap aids conception. This is a prescriptive medical device, but not commonly prescribed by physicians.<ref>http://www.newsrx.com/pr_details.php?type=1&id=2904</ref>

=== At-home assessment ===

Prior to expensive fertility procedures, many women and couples turn to online sources to determine their chances of success. A [[take-home baby assessment]] can provide a best guess estimate compared with women who have succeeded with [[in vitro fertilization]], based on variables such as maternal age, duration of infertility and number of prior pregnancies.<ref>http://www.formyodds.com</ref>

=== Medical treatments ===

Medical treatment of infertility generally involves the use of [[fertility medication]], medical device, surgery, or a combination of the following. If the sperm are of good quality and the mechanics of the woman's reproductive structures are good (patent fallopian tubes, no adhesions or scarring), physicians may start by prescribing a course of ovarian stimulating medication. The physician may also suggest using a conception cap [[cervical cap]], which the patient uses at home by placing the sperm inside the cap and putting the [[conception device]] on the cervix, or intrauterine insemination (IUI), in which the doctor introduces sperm into the uterus during ovulation, via a catheter. In these methods, [[fertilization]] occurs inside the body.

If conservative medical treatments fail to achieve a full term pregnancy, the physician may suggest the patient undergo [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF). IVF and related techniques ([[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]], [[ZIFT]], [[Gamete intrafallopian transfer|GIFT]]) are called [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART) techniques.

ART techniques generally start with stimulating the ovaries to increase egg production. After stimulation, the physician surgically extracts one or more eggs from the ovary, and unites them with sperm in a laboratory setting, with the intent of producing one or more embryos. Fertilization takes place outside the body, and the fertilized egg is reinserted into the woman's reproductive tract, in a procedure called [[embryo transfer]].

Other medical techniques are e.g. [[tuboplasty]], assisted hatching, and [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]].

===Tourism===
{{Main|Fertility tourism}}
''Fertility tourism'' is the practice of traveling to another country for fertility treatments.<ref>http://www.wordspy.com/words/fertilitytourism.asp wordspy.com</ref> It may be regarded as a form of [[medical tourism]]. The main reasons for fertility tourism are legal regulation of the sought procedure in the home country, or lower price. [[In-vitro fertilization]] and [[donor insemination]] are major procedures involved.

==Ethics==
There are several ethical issues associated with infertility and its treatment.
*High-cost treatments are out of financial reach for some couples.
*Debate over whether health insurance companies (e.g. in the US) should be required to cover infertility treatment.
*Allocation of medical resources that could be used elsewhere
*The legal status of [[embryos]] fertilized [[in vitro]] and not transferred [[in vivo]]. (See also [[Beginning of pregnancy controversy]]).
*Pro-life opposition to the destruction of embryos not transferred [[in vivo]].
*IVF and other fertility treatments have resulted in an increase in [[multiple birth]]s, provoking ethical analysis because of the link between multiple pregnancies, [[premature birth]], and a host of health problems.
*Religious leaders' opinions on fertility treatments.
*Infertility caused by DNA defects on the Y chromosome is passed on from father to son. If [[natural selection]] is the primary error correction mechanism that prevents random mutations on the Y chromosome, then fertility treatments for men with abnormal sperm (in particular [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]]) only defer the underlying problem to the next male generation.

Many countries have special frameworks for dealing with the ethical and social issues around fertility treatment.

* One of the best known is the [[HFEA]] – The UK's regulator for fertility treatment and embryo research. This was set up on 1 August 1991 following a detailed commission of enquiry led by [[Mary Warnock]] in the 1980s

* A similar model to the HFEA has been adopted by the rest of the countries in the European Union. Each country has its own body or bodies responsible for the inspection and licencing of fertility treatment under the EU Tissues and Cells directive <ref>http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/cha/c11573.htm EU Tissues and Cells directive</ref>

* Regulatory bodies are also found in Canada <ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/reprod/agenc/index_e.html Assisted Human Reproduction Canada]</ref> and in the state of Victoria in Australia <ref>[http://www.ita.org.au/ ITA]</ref>

==Psychological impact==
The consequences of infertility are manifold and can include societal repercussions and personal suffering. Advances in assisted reproductive technologies, such as IVF, can offer hope to many couples where treatment is available, although barriers exist in terms of medical coverage and affordability. The medicalization of infertility has unwittingly led to a disregard for the emotional responses that couples experience, which include distress, loss of control, stigmatization, and a disruption in the developmental trajectory of adulthood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cousineau TM, Domar AD.|title=Psychological impact of infertility |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol. |volume=21 |issue=2|pages=293–308 |year=2007 |pmid=17241818 |doi=10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2006.12.003 }}</ref>

Infertility may have profound psychological effects. Partners may become more anxious to conceive, increasing [[sexual dysfunction]].<ref name=barrattberger>Donor insemination Edited by C.L.R. Barratt and I.D. Cooke. Cambridge (England): Cambridge University Press, 1993. 231 pages., page 13, citing Berger (1980)</ref> Marital discord often develops in infertile couples, especially when they are under pressure to make medical decisions.

The emotional losses created by infertility include the denial of motherhood as a rite of passage; the loss of one’s anticipated and imagined life; feeling a loss of control over one’s life; doubting one’s womanhood; changed and sometimes lost friendships; and, for many, the loss of one’s religious environment as a support system.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Recovery From Traumatic Loss: A Study of Women Living Without Children After Infertility |journal=Doctorate in Social Work (DSW) Dissertations.

==Social impact==
In many cultures, inability to conceive bears a stigma. In closed social groups, a degree of rejection (or a sense of being rejected by the couple) may cause considerable anxiety and disappointment. Some respond by actively avoiding the issue altogether; middle-class men are the most likely to respond in this way.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmidt L, Christensen U, Holstein BE |title=The social epidemiology of coping with infertility |journal=Hum Reprod. |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=1044–52 |year=2005 |month=Apr |pmid=15608029 |doi=10.1093/humrep/deh687 }}</ref>

In an effort to end the shame and secrecy of infertility, Redbook in October 2011 launched a video campaign, The Truth About Trying, to start an open conversation about infertility, which strikes one in eight women in the United States. In a survey of couples having difficulty conceiving, conducted by the pharmaceutical company Merck, 61 percent of respondents hid their infertility from family and friends.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The invisible pain of Infertility |journal=Redbook |year=2011 |month=October|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref> Nearly half didn't even tell their mothers. The message of those speaking out: It's not always easy to get pregnant, and there's no shame in that.

There are legal ramifications as well. Infertility has begun to gain more exposure to legal domains. An estimated 4 million workers in the U.S. used the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]] (FMLA) in 2004 to care for a child, parent or spouse, or because of their own personal illness. Many treatments for infertility, including diagnostic tests, surgery and therapy for depression, can qualify one for FMLA leave.  It has been suggested that infertility be classified as a form of disability.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Khetarpal|first=A|coauthors=Singh, S|title=Infertility: Why can't we classify this inability as disability?|journal=The Australasian medical journal|year=2012|volume=5|issue=6|pages=334–9|pmid=22848333|doi=10.4066/AMJ.2012.1290|pmc=3395292}}</ref>

==Infertility in Developing Countries==
Infertility is often not seen (by the West) as being an issue in developing or underdeveloped countries <ref>(Inhorn 2003 p1841)</ref>. This is because of assumptions about overpopulation problems and hyper fertility in developing countries and a perceived need for them to decrease their populations and birth rates <ref>(Lock and Nguyen 2011 p.269)</ref>. Because of this fertility treatments, even simple ones such as treatment for STIs that cause infertility, are usually not made available to individuals in these countries <ref>(Lock and Nguyen 2011 p.269-270)</ref>. Despite this, infertility has profound effects on individuals in developing countries, as the production of children is often highly socially valued and are vital for social security and health networks as well as for family income generation <ref>(Lock and Nguyen 2011 p.263)</ref>. Infertility in these societies often leads to social stigmatization and abandonment by spouses <ref>(Inhorn 2003 p.1842)</ref>.

==Fictional representation==
Perhaps except for [[Pregnancy in science fiction|infertility in science fiction]], films and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of [[assisted reproductive technology]] have had an upswing first in the latter part of the 2000s decade, although the techniques have been available for decades.<ref name=chicagotribune>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/art/chi-0621-fertility-dramasjun21,0,2997759.story chicagotribune.com Heartache of infertility shared on stage, screen] By Colleen Mastony, Tribune reporter. 21 June 2009</ref> Yet, the amount of people that can relate to it by personal experience in one way or another is ever growing, and the variety of trials and struggles is huge.<ref name=chicagotribune/>
