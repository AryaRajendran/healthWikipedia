'''Video game-related health problems''' can induce [[repetitive strain injury|repetitive strain injuries]], [[skin disorder]]s or other health issues.

Studies have mainly reported health problems in children, mainly boys.

Existing literature on gaming is inconsistent, and studies occasionally produce contradictory results. Some studies show strong correlations between gaming and psychological issues like increased aggression in males, and increased depression in females.<ref name="pmid19765501"/> Whilst another study claims that girls who gamed were less likely to experience depression but were more likely to get into fights. <ref name="pmid21078729">{{cite journal |author=Desai RA, Krishnan-Sarin S, Cavallo D, Potenza MN |title=Video-gaming among high school students: health correlates, gender differences, and problematic gaming |journal=Pediatrics |volume=126 |issue=6 |pages=1414–24 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21078729 |doi=|url=}}</ref>

A further study involving musculoskeletal symptoms and computer use among Finnish adolescents affirmed the association between musculoskeletal symptoms and computer usage.

Consistently long sessions of video game play also leads to an increased likelihood of lower back pain, according to a study conducted in a population of school children.

== Vision problems ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

Video game playing may be associated with vision problems.<ref name="pmid12441565"/> Extensive viewing of the screen can cause eye strain, as the cornea, pupil, and iris are not intended for mass viewing sessions of electronic devices. Using video games for too long may also cause headaches, dizziness, and chances of vomiting from focusing on a screen for too long.

However, certain studies have shown that video games can be used to improve various eye conditions. An investigation into the effect of action gaming on spatial distribution of attention was conducted and revealed that gamers exhibited an enhancement with attentional resources compared to non-gamers, not only in the periphery but also in central vision.<ref name="pmid17154785">{{cite journal |author=Green CS, Bravelier D|title=Effect of action video games on the spatial distribution of visuospatial attention |journal=J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform |volume=32 |issue=6 |page=1465-78 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17154785 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Further studies in 2011, concluded that a combination of video game therapy alongside occlusion therapy, would greatly improve the recovery of visual acuity in those experiencing [[Amblyopia]].<ref name="pmid21912514">{{cite journal |author=Li RW, Ngo C, Nguyen J, Levi DM|title=Video-game play induces plasticity in the visual system of adults with amblyopia. |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=9 |issue=8 |page= |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21912514 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001135 |url=}}</ref>

== Psychological problems ==
Some studies claim that excessive video game playing may lead to several adverse psychological affects. One such study claimed that excessive interaction with violent video games may lead to an increase in aggressive behaviour and decreases pro-social behaviour.<ref name="pmid11554666">{{cite journal |author=Anderson CA, Bushman BJ |title=Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: a meta-analytic review of the scientific literature |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=12 |issue=5 |page=353-359 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11554666 |doi= |url=}}</ref> A different study involving a mixture of male and female undergraduate students supports the previous fact and also claims that the effect is larger for men than for women. <ref name="doi10.1006">{{cite journal |author=Anderson CA, Bartholow BD |title=Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggressive Behavior: Potential Sex Differences |journal= Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=38 |issue=3 |page=283-290 |year=2002 |month=May|pmid= |doi=10.1006/jesp.2001.1502 |url=}}</ref> On the other hand, studies have also revealed that participation in pro-social video games increases pro-social cognitions and helpful behaviours. Sessions of pro-social video games are associated with reduced hostility and increased positive state affect; Violent video games proved to have the opposite effects.<ref name="pmid22549724>{{cite journal |author=Saleem M, Anderson CA, Gentile DA |title=Effects of Prosocial, Neutral, and Violent Video Games on College Students' Affect. |journal= Aggress Behav |volume= |issue= |page= |year=2012 |month=May|pmid= |doi=10.1002/ab.21427 |url=}}</ref>

Studies have concerning video game play and cerebral blood flow, concluded that after a session of violent video game play, the player would show a significant decrease in cerebral blood flow in the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], [[temporal cortex]], [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[fusiform gyrus]]. The decreased cerebral blood flow thus shows reduced or abnormal prefrontal cortex functions after video game playing. <ref name="pmid23137807">{{cite journal |author=Chou YH, Yang BH, Hsu JW, Wang SJ, Lin CL, Huang KL, Chien Chang A, Lee SM |title=Effects of video game playing on cerebral blood flow in young adults: A SPECT study. |journal= Psychiatry Res |volume= |issue=|page= |year=2012 |month=November|pmid=23137807 |doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2012.10.002 |url=}}</ref>

Violent video games also contribute to stress levels. A recent study states that violent video game players had lower cardiac coherence levels and higher aggression levels compared to non-violent game players. The study claims that it is quite possible that violent games increase aggression by inducing stress, however more studies are required to fully confirm this fact. <ref name="pmid23097053">{{cite journal |author=Hasan Y, Bègue L, Bushman BJ. |title=Violent video games stress people out and make them more aggressive. |journal= Aggress Behav.  |volume=39 |issue=1|page=64-70 |year=2013 |month=January|pmid=23097053 |doi=10.1002/ab.21454 |url=}}</ref> 

A study in 2009 showed greater depression amongst female video game players, and overall poorer health when compared to females who did not play video games.

== Video games and obesity ==
Video game play has been constantly associated with obesity. Many studies have been conducted on the link between television & video games and increased BMI ([[Body Mass Index]]).
