In [[medicine]], '''pulmonary hypertension''' (PH) is an increase of blood pressure in the [[pulmonary artery]], [[pulmonary vein]], or pulmonary capillaries, together known as the [[lung]] [[Pulmonary circulation|vasculature]], leading to [[dypsnea|shortness of breath]], [[dizziness]], [[fainting]], and other symptoms, all of which are exacerbated by exertion. Pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and [[heart failure]]. It was first identified by Dr. Ernst von Romberg in 1891.<ref>{{cite journal|last=von Romberg |first=Ernst |title=Über Sklerose der Lungenarterie|journal=Dtsch Arch Klin Med |language=German|year=1891-1892|volume=48|pages=197–206}}</ref> According to the most recent classification, it can be one of five different types: ''arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic'' or ''miscellaneous''.<ref name=Venice>{{cite journal |author=Simonneau G, Galiè N, Rubin LJ, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension |journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. |volume=43 |issue=12 Suppl S |pages=5S–12S |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15194173 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2004.02.037 | url=http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/full/43/12_Suppl_S/5S}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Because symptoms may develop very gradually, patients may delay seeing a physician for years. Common symptoms are [[shortness of breath]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], non-productive [[cough]], [[angina pectoris]], fainting or [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], [[peripheral]] [[oedema|edema]] (swelling around the ankles and feet), and rarely [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up blood).

[[Pulmonary]] ''venous'' [[hypertension]] typically presents with shortness of breath while lying flat or sleeping ([[orthopnea]] or [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]]), while pulmonary ''arterial'' hypertension (PAH) typically does not.

A detailed family history is established to determine whether the disease might be [[hereditary|familial]]. A history of exposure to drugs such as [[cocaine]], [[methamphetamine]], [[alcohol]] leading to [[cirrhosis]], and tobacco leading to [[emphysema]] are considered significant. A [[physical examination]] is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension, including a loud S2 (pulmonic valve closure sound), (para)sternal heave, jugular venous distension, pedal [[edema]], [[ascites]], [[Abdominojugular test|hepatojugular reflux]], [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] etc. Evidence of [[tricuspid insufficiency]] is also sought and, if present, is consistent with the presence of pulmonary hypertension.

==Causes and classification==
A 1973 meeting organized by the [[World Health Organization]] was the first to attempt classification of pulmonary hypertension. A distinction was made between primary and secondary PH, and primary PH was divided in the "arterial plexiform", "veno-occlusive" and "thromboembolic" forms.<ref>{{cite book | author=Hatano S, Strasser R | title=Primary pulmonary hypertension | publisher=World Health Organization | location=Geneva | year=1975}}</ref> A second conference in 1998 at [[Évian-les-Bains]] also addressed the causes of secondary PH (i.e. those due to other medical conditions),<ref>{{cite book | author=Rich S, Rubin LJ, Abenhail L ''et al.'' | title=Executive summary from the World Symposium on Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (Evian, France, September 6–10, 1998) | publisher=The World Health Organization | location=Geneva | year=1998 |url=http://www.who.int/ncd/cvd/pph.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020408173726/http://www.who.int/ncd/cvd/pph.html | archivedate=April 8, 2002}}</ref> and in 2003, the 3rd World Symposium on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension was convened in Venice to modify the classification based on new understandings of disease mechanisms. The revised system developed by this group provides the current framework for understanding pulmonary hypertension.<ref name=Venice/> The system includes several improvements over the former 1998 Evian Classification system. Risk factor descriptions were updated, and the classification of congenital systemic-to pulmonary shunts was revised. A new classification of genetic factors in PH was recommended, but not implemented because available data were judged to be inadequate.<ref name=Venice/>

The Venice 2003 Revised Classification system can be summarized as follows:<ref name=Venice/>
* WHO Group I - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
** Idiopathic (IPAH)
** Familial (FPAH)
** Associated with other diseases (APAH): [[collagen vascular disease]] (e.g. [[scleroderma]]), congenital shunts between the systemic and pulmonary circulation, [[portal hypertension]], [[HIV]] infection, drugs, toxins, or other diseases or disorders
** Associated with venous or capillary disease
* WHO Group II - Pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease
** Atrial or ventricular disease
** Valvular disease (e.g. [[mitral stenosis]])
* WHO Group III - Pulmonary hypertension associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxemia
** [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), [[interstitial lung disease]] (ILD)
** [[Sleep-disordered breathing]], alveolar hypoventilation
** Chronic exposure to high altitude
** Developmental lung abnormalities
* WHO Group IV - Pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thrombotic and/or embolic disease
** [[Pulmonary embolism]] in the proximal or distal pulmonary arteries
** Embolization of other matter, such as [[tumor]] cells or [[parasite]]s
* WHO Group V - Miscellaneous

The classification does not include [[sickle cell disease]],<ref name="pmid14985486">{{cite journal |author=Gladwin MT, Sachdev V, Jison ML, ''et al.'' |title=Pulmonary hypertension as a risk factor for death in patients with sickle cell disease |journal=N.

==Pathogenesis==
Whatever the initial cause, pulmonary ''arterial'' hypertension ([[Pulmonary hypertension#Classification|WHO Group I]]) involves the [[Vasoconstrictor|vasoconstriction]] or tightening of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood through the [[lungs]], much as it is harder to make water flow through a narrow pipe as opposed to a wide one. Over time, the affected blood vessels become both stiffer and thicker, in a process known as [[fibrosis]]. This further increases the blood pressure within the lungs and impairs their blood flow. In addition, the increased workload of the heart causes [[ventricular hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] of the [[right ventricle]], making the heart less able to pump blood through the lungs, ultimately causing [[right heart failure]] (a condition known as [[cor pulmonale]]). As the blood flowing through the lungs decreases, the left side of the heart receives less blood. This blood may also carry less oxygen than normal. Therefore it becomes harder and harder for the left side of the heart to pump to supply sufficient [[oxygen]] to the rest of the body, especially during physical activity.

Pathogenesis in pulmonary ''venous'' hypertension ([[Pulmonary hypertension#Classification|WHO Group II]]) is completely different. There is no obstruction to blood flow in the lungs. Instead, the left heart fails to pump blood efficiently, leading to pooling of blood in the lungs. This causes [[pulmonary edema]] and [[pleural effusion]]s.

In hypoxic pulmonary hypertension ([[Pulmonary hypertension#Classification|WHO Group III]]), the low levels of oxygen are thought to cause [[vasoconstriction]] or tightening of pulmonary arteries. This leads to a similar [[pathophysiology]] as pulmonary arterial hypertension.

In chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ([[Pulmonary hypertension#Classification|WHO Group IV]]), the blood vessels are blocked or narrowed with blood clots. Again, this leads to a similar [[pathophysiology]] as pulmonary arterial hypertension.

==Molecular pathology of PAH==
The molecular mechanism of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is not known yet, but it is believed that the endothelial dysfunction results in a decrease in the synthesis of endothelium-derived vasodilators such as [[nitric oxide]] and [[prostacyclin]]. Moreover, there’s a stimulation of the synthesis of vasoconstrictors such as [[thromboxane]] and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These results in a severe vasoconstriction and smooth muscle and [[adventitial]] hypertrophy characteristic of patients with PAH.<ref>Budhiraja R, Tuder RM, Hassoun. PM. Endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary hypertension. Circulation. 2004;109:159–165.</ref>
[[File:Molecular pathway of vasodilation mediated by cGMP.jpg|thumb|Molecular pathway of vasodilation mediated by nitric oxide]]
In normal conditions, the [[nitric oxide synthase]] produces nitric oxide from L-arginine in presence of oxygen. Adenylate-cyclase and gualynate-cyclase are activated in presence of nitric oxide and these enzymes produce [[cAMP]] and [[cGMP]] respectively. The cGMP is produced by a type of guanylate cyclase (which is a kind of pyrophosphate-liase cyclase): the soluble guanylate cyclase (or sGC), that catalyzes the formation of cGMP from GTP. sGC is a heterodimer made up of one  α subunit and one β sub-unit in each chain. It also contains a prosthetic [[heme group]], required for NO binding. The union of NO and sGC produces a conformational enzyme change that stimulates cGMP production.<ref name="tesi">Fosfodiesterasas del AMPc y del GMPc en el cerebro: Expresión en procesos neuroinflamatorios y neurodegenerativos. URL: http://www.tesisenred.net/bitstream/handle/10803/891/03.ERI_METODOS.pdf?sequence=4. Viewed 3 November 2012.</ref>

In the vascular endothelium, cGMP activates cGMP kinase or [[PKG]] (protein kinase G), which is a enzyme that belongs to a type of serine/threonine - specific protein [[kinase]]. PKG is a dimer composed of two similar polypeptides chains that share a common molecular structure. Each subunit contains a catalytic domain and regulatory domain. GMP-kinase activates potassium channels and subsequently the inhibition of calcium channels. Thus, this process leads to a reduction of intracellular calcium and finally a vasodilation.<ref>Ghofrani HA, Pepke-Zaba J, Barbera JA, et al. Nitric oxide pathway and phosphodiesterase inhibitors in pulmonary arterial hypertension. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2004;43:68S–72S.</ref>

Phosphodiesterase type V ([[PDE5]]), which is abundant in the pulmonary tissue, is a metalohydrolase that hydrolyzes the cyclic bond of cGMP in the presence of divalent cations (Zn<sup>2+</sup>). Actually, Zn<sup>2+</sup> union is necessary for PDE5 activity. In the N-terminal region (catalytic center) of PDE5 there is an aminoacid sequence (residues 142-526) that joins cGMP. This sequence of PDE5 is divided in two domains; GAF-A and GAF-B; but only GAF-A has the necessary affinity to bind cGMP. This union increases the catalytic activity and it is stabilized by a close serine phosphorylation (performed by a kinase). Consequently, the concentration of cGMP decreases and the vasodilation is stopped.<ref name="tesi" />

Patients with PAH produce less NO and others vasodilators and produce more vasoconstrictors. Consequently, this molecular pathway doesn’t work properly and it results in a constant vasoconstriction. For this reason, NO and PDE5 inhibitors such as tadalafil or sildenafil are possible therapies.<ref>Ghofrani HA, Pepke-Zaba J, Barbera JA, et al. Nitric oxide pathway and phosphodiesterase inhibitors in pulmonary arterial hypertension. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2004;43:68S–72S.</ref> Tadalafil, for example, causes a vasodilation mediated by nitric oxide in the pulmonary endothelium.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Phonocardiogram.jpg|thumb|Phonocardiogram and jugular venous pulse tracing from a middle-aged man with pulmonary hypertension caused by cardiomyopathy. The jugular venous pulse tracing demonstrates a prominent a wave without a c or v wave being observed. The phonocardiograms (fourth left interspace and cardiac apex) show a murmur of tricuspid insufficiency and ventricular and atrial gallops.]]
Because pulmonary hypertension can be of five major types, a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary ''arterial'' hypertension from ''venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic,'' or ''miscellaneous'' varieties..

A [[physical examination]] is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension. These include altered [[heart sounds]], such as a widely split S<sub>2</sub> or second heart sound, a loud P<sub>2</sub> or [[Pulmonary valve|pulmonic valve]] closure sound (part of the second heart sound), (para)sternal heave, possible S<sub>3</sub> or [[third heart sound]], and [[pulmonary regurgitation]]. Other signs include an elevated [[jugular venous pressure]], [[peripheral edema]] (swelling of the ankles and feet), [[ascites]] (abdominal swelling due to the accumulation of fluid), [[Abdominojugular test|hepatojugular reflux]], and [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]].

Further procedures are required to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension and exclude other possible diagnoses. These generally include [[pulmonary function test]]s; [[blood test]]s to exclude [[HIV]], [[autoimmune]] diseases, and liver disease; [[electrocardiography]] (ECG); [[arterial blood gas]] measurements; [[X-ray]]s of the chest (followed by high-resolution [[CT scan]]ning if [[interstitial lung disease]] is suspected); and ventilation-perfusion or [[V/Q scan]]ning to exclude chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Biopsy of the lung is usually not indicated unless the pulmonary hypertension is thought to be due to an underlying interstitial lung disease; further, lung biopsies are fraught with risks of bleeding due to the high intrapulmonary blood pressure. Clinical improvement is often measured by a "six-minute walk test", i.e. the distance a patient can walk in six minutes. Stability and improvement in this measurement correlate with better survival. Blood [[Brain natriuretic peptide|BNP]] level is also being used now to follow progress of patients with pulmonary hypertension. {{cn|date=July 2012}}

[[File:Pulmonary artery catheter english.JPG|thumb|Pulmonary artery catheter]]
Diagnosis of PAH requires the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Although pulmonary arterial pressure can be estimated on the basis of [[echocardiography]], pressure measurements with a [[Swan-Ganz catheter]] through the right side of the heart provides the most definite assessment. PAOP (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) and PVR (pulmonary vascular resistance) cannot be measured directly with [[echocardiography]]. Therefore diagnosis of PAH requires right-sided [[cardiac catheterization]]. A Swan-Ganz catheter can also measure the [[cardiac output]], which is far more important in measuring disease severity than the pulmonary arterial pressure.

Normal pulmonary arterial pressure in a person living at sea level has a mean value of 12–16&nbsp;mm Hg (1600–2100 Pa). Pulmonary hypertension is present when mean pulmonary artery pressure exceeds 25&nbsp;mm Hg (3300 Pa) at rest or 30&nbsp;mm Hg (4000 Pa) with exercise.

''Mean'' pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) should not be confused with systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP), which is often reported on [[echocardiogram]] reports. A systolic pressure of 40&nbsp;mm Hg typically implies a ''mean'' pressure of more than 25&nbsp;mm Hg. Roughly, mPAP = 0.61•sPAP + 2.

==Treatment==
Treatment is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. Since pulmonary ''venous'' hypertension is synonymous with [[congestive heart failure]], the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of [[diuretic]]s, [[beta blocker]]s, [[ACE inhibitor]]s etc., or to repair/replace the [[mitral valve]] or [[aortic valve]].

In PAH, lifestyle changes, [[digoxin]], [[diuretic]]s, oral [[anticoagulant]]s, and oxygen therapy are considered ''conventional'' therapy, but have never been proven to be beneficial in a randomized, prospective manner.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

High dose [[calcium channel blocker]]s are useful in only 5% of IPAH patients who are ''vasoreactive'' by [[Swan-Ganz catheter]]. Unfortunately, calcium channel blockers have been largely misused, being prescribed to many patients with non-vasoreactive PAH, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. The criteria for vasoreactivity have changed. Only those patients whose ''mean'' pulmonary artery pressure falls by more than 10&nbsp;mm Hg to less than 40&nbsp;mm Hg with an unchanged or increased cardiac output when challenged with [[adenosine]], [[epoprostenol]], or [[nitric oxide]] are considered vasoreactive.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barst RJ, McGoon M, Torbicki A, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnosis and differential assessment of pulmonary arterial hypertension |journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. |volume=43 |issue=12 Suppl S |pages=40S–47S |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15194177 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2004.02.032}}</ref> Of these, only half of the patients are responsive to [[calcium channel blocker]]s in the long term.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sitbon O, Humbert M, Jaïs X, ''et al.'' |title=Long-term response to calcium channel blockers in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension |journal=Circulation |volume=111 |issue=23 |pages=3105–11 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15939821 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.488486 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/short/111/23/3105}}</ref>

A number of agents have recently been introduced for primary and secondary PAH. The trials supporting the use of these agents have been relatively small, and the only measure consistently used to compare their effectivity is the "6 minute walk test". Many have no data on mortality benefit or time to progression.<ref name="pmid17877662">{{cite journal |author=Torres F |title=Systematic review of randomised, double-blind clinical trials of oral agents conducted in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension |journal=Int. J. Clin. Pract. |volume=61 |issue=10 |pages=1756–65 |year=2007 |pmid=17877662 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2007.01545.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2007.01545.x}}</ref>

===Vasoactive substances===
Many pathways are involved in the abnormal proliferation and contraction of the [[smooth muscle]] cells of the pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Three of these pathways are important since they have been targeted with drugs — [[endothelin receptor antagonist]]s, [[phosphodiesterase]] type 5 inhibitors, and prostacyclin derivatives.

Because inexpensive generic drugs for this disease are not widely available, the World Health Organization does not include them in its model list of [[essential medicines]].

====Prostaglandins====
[[Prostacyclin]] ([[prostaglandin]] I<sub>2</sub>) is commonly considered the most effective treatment for PAH. [[Epoprostenol]] (synthetic [[prostacyclin]], marketed as Flolan) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent [[central venous catheter]]. This delivery system can cause [[sepsis]] and [[thrombosis]]. Flolan is unstable, and therefore has to be kept on ice during administration. Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous (24/7), and interruption can be fatal. Other [[prostanoid]]s have therefore been developed. [[Treprostinil]] (Remodulin) can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful. An increased risk of sepsis with intravenous Remodulin has been reported by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]. [[Iloprost]] (Ilomedin) is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half life. [[Iloprost]] (marketed as Ventavis) was the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe, until the inhaled form of [[treprostinil]] was approved by the FDA in July 2009 and is marketed under the trade name Tyvaso. The inhaled form of administration has the advantage of selective deposition in the lungs with less systemic side effects, however coughing and throat irritation commonly occur. Oral and inhaled forms of Remodulin are under development. [[Beraprost]] is an oral prostanoid available in South Korea and Japan.

====Endothelin receptor antagonists====
The dual (ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub>) [[endothelin]] receptor antagonist [[bosentan]] (marketed as Tracleer) was approved in 2001. [[Sitaxentan]], a selective endothelin receptor antagonist that blocks only the action of ET<sub>A</sub>, has been approved for use in Canada, Australia, and the European Union, to be marketed under the name Thelin.<ref name="Thelin">{{cite web |date=2008-05-30 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUSBNG28335020070530 |title=UPDATE 1-Encysive gets Canadian approval for hypertension drug |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> Sitaxentan has not been approved for marketing by the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). In 2010, Thelin was withdrawn by Pfizer due to severe side effects. A new trial to address the FDA's concerns will begin in 2008. A similar drug, [[ambrisentan]] is marketed as Letairis in U.S. by [[Gilead Sciences]].<ref>{{cite press release | title = U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approves Gilead's Letairis Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension | publisher = [[Gilead Sciences]] | date = 2007-06-15 | url = http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_1016053 | accessdate = 2007-06-16}}</ref> In addition, another dual/nonselective endothelin antagonist, Actelion-1, from the makers of Tracleer, will enter clinical trials in 2008.

====Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors====
The U.S. FDA approved [[Sildenafil]], a selective inhibitor of [[cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5]] (PDE5), for the treatment of PAH in 2005. It is marketed for PAH as Revatio. In 2009, they also approved [[Tadalafil]], another PDE5 inhibitor, marketed under the name Adcirca.<ref>{{cite press release|date=2009-05-26|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/2009/05/26/FDA-approves-Adcirca-(tadalafil)-tablets-for-pulmonary-arterial-hypertension.aspx|title=FDA approves Adcirca (tadalafil) tablets for pulmonary arterial hypertension | accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref> PDE5 inhibitors are believed to increase pulmonary artery vasodilation, and inhibit vascular remodeling, thus lowering pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Tadalafil is taken orally, as well as sildenafil, and it is rapidly absorbed (serum levels are detectable at 20 minutes). The recommended dose is 40mg in one single dose per day and the T<sub>1/2</sub> ([[biological half-life]]) hovers around 17.5 hours in healthy subjects.<ref name="ciatacio2">Forgue ST, Patterson BE, Bedding. AW, et al. Tadalafil pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.

====Activators of soluble guanylate cyclase====
Soluble [[guanylate cyclase]] (sGC) is the intracellular receptor for [[Nitric oxide|NO]]. {{As of|April 2009}}, the sGC activators [[cinaciguat]] and [[riociguat]] are undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of PAH.

===Surgical===
[[Atrial septostomy]] is a surgical procedure that creates a communication between the right and left [[Atrium (heart)|atria]]. It relieves pressure on the right side of the heart, but at the cost of lower oxygen levels in blood (hypoxia).

[[Lung transplantation]] cures pulmonary arterial hypertension, but leaves the patient with the complications of transplantation, and a post-surgical [[median]] survival of just over five years.<ref name="SRTR">{{cite web |date=2006-05-01 |url=http://www.ustransplant.org/annual_reports/current/113_surv-new_dh.htm |title=2006 OPTN/SRTR Annual Report |publisher=US Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients |accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref>

[[Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy]] (PTE) is a surgical procedure that is used for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. It is the surgical removal of an organized [[thrombus]] (clot) along with the lining of the pulmonary artery; it is a very difficult, major procedure that is currently performed in a few select centers. Case series show remarkable success in most patients.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Treatment regimens for hypoxic and miscellaneous varieties of pulmonary hypertension have not been established. However, studies of several agents are currently enrolling patients. Many physicians will treat these diseases with the same medications as for PAH, until better options become available. Such treatment is called [[off-label use]].

===Monitoring===
Patients are normally monitored through commonly available tests such as:
* [[pulse oximetry]]
* [[arterial blood gas]] tests
* [[chest X-ray]]s
* serial [[ECG]] tests
* serial [[echocardiography]]
* [[spirometry]] or more advanced lung function studies

==Prognosis==
The [[NIH]] IPAH registry from the 1980s showed an ''untreated'' median survival of 2–3 years from time of diagnosis, with the cause of death usually being right ventricular failure ([[cor pulmonale]]). Although this figure is widely quoted, it is probably irrelevant today. Outcomes have changed dramatically over the last two decades. This may be because of newer drug therapy, better overall care, and earlier diagnosis (lead time bias). A recent outcome study of those patients who had started treatment with bosentan (Tracleer) showed that 89% patients were alive at 2 years.<ref name="pmid15684287">{{cite journal |author=McLaughlin VV, Sitbon O, Badesch DB, ''et al.'' |title=Survival with first-line bosentan in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension |journal=Eur.

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare disease with an incidence of about 2-3 per million per year<ref name="Rudarakanchana">{{cite journal | last=Rudarakanchana | first=N | coauthors= Trembath RC, Morrell NW | title=New insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension | journal=Thorax | volume=56 | issue=11 | pages=888–890 | date=November 2001 | pmid=11641516 | pmc=1745964 | doi=10.1136/thorax.56.11.888}}</ref> and a prevalence of about 15 per million. Adult females are almost three times as likely to present with IPAH than adult males. The presentation of IPAH within children is more evenly split along gender lines.

Other forms of PAH are far more common. In [[scleroderma]] the incidence has been estimated to be 6 to 60% of all patients, in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] up to 21%, in [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] 4 to 14%, in [[portal hypertension]] between 2 to 5%, in HIV about 0.5%, and in sickle cell disease ranging from 20 to 40%.

Diet pills such as [[Fen-Phen]] produced an annual incidence of 25-50 per million per year.

Pulmonary venous hypertension is exceedingly common, since it occurs in most patients symptomatic with congestive heart failure.

Up to 4% of people who suffer a [[pulmonary embolism]] go on to develop chronic thromboembolic disease including pulmonary hypertension.

Only about 1.1% of patients with [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] develop pulmonary hypertension with no other disease to explain the high pressure. [[Sleep apnea]] is usually associated with only very mild pulmonary hypertension, typically below the level of detection. On the other hand [[Pickwickian syndrome]] (obesity-hypoventilation syndrome) is very commonly associated with right [[heart failure]] due to pulmonary hypertension.
