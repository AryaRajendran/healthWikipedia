'''Maggie's Cancer Caring Centres''' are a network of drop-in centres in [[Great Britain]], which
aim to help anyone who has been affected by [[cancer]].  They are not intended as a replacement for conventional cancer therapy, but as a caring environment that can provide support, information and practical advice.  They are located nearby, but are separate from, existing [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals.

The [[Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator|Scottish registered]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] (registration number SC024414) which promotes, builds and runs the centres is formally named the '''Maggie Keswick Jencks Cancer Caring Trust''', but refers to itself simply as '''Maggie's'''. It was founded by and named after the late Maggie Keswick Jencks, who died of cancer in 1995. Like her husband, architectural writer and critic [[Charles Jencks]], she believed in the ability of buildings to uplift people. The buildings that house the centres have been designed by leading architects, including [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]] and [[Richard Rogers]].<ref>See [[Charles Jencks]] and [[Edwin Heathcote]], ''The Architecture of Hope: Maggie's Cancer Caring Centres'', London, Frances Lincoln, 2010. ISBN 978-0-7112-2597-8</ref>

[[Patron]]s of the charity include [[Frank Gehry]], [[Jon Snow]], [[Kirsty Wark]], and [[Sarah Brown (spouse)|Sarah Brown]], wife of former British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]]. {{Asof|2011}}, the charity's [[chief operating officer]] is Laura Lee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zf33k|title=Midweek| publisher=[[BBC]]| date= 16/03/2011| accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref>

==The centres==
===Edinburgh===
[[File:Maggie's Centre, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Maggie's Centre in [[Edinburgh]], designed by [[Richard Murphy (architect)|Richard Murphy]]]]
The first Maggie's Centre opened in [[Edinburgh]] in 1996, and is located within the [[Western General Hospital]] on Crewe Road. The centre is housed in a converted stable block. The conversion, designed by [[Richard Murphy (architect)|Richard Murphy]], was nominated for 1997 [[Stirling Prize]]. The centre was extended, again by Murphy, in 1999.

===Glasgow===
The Maggie's Centre in [[Glasgow]] is located at the [[Western Infirmary]] on Dumbarton Road, near the [[Kelvingrove Museum]]. The centre is housed in a former gatehouse lodge of the [[University of Glasgow]], renovated and altered by [[Page\Park Architects]]. Charles Jencks designed the landscaping around the site, and contributed a DNA sculpture for the garden.

===Dundee===
[[Image:Maggies centre Dundee.jpg|thumb|right|Maggie's Centre, [[Ninewells]], [[Dundee]], designed by [[Frank Gehry]]]]
[[Frank Gehry]]'s first building in the United Kingdom was the Maggie's Centre at [[Dundee]]. The centre opened in September 2003 at [[Ninewells Hospital]]. Gehry's design was named "Building of the Year" by the [[Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland]], and was also nominated for the 2004 [[RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture]].

===Highlands===
The Maggie's Centre in [[Inverness]], [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], is at [[Raigmore Hospital]], and was designed by [[Page\Park Architects]]. Landscape design and sculptures were again the work of Charles Jencks. The building opened in 2005, and won the 2006 RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture.

[[Image:MaggiesCentreKirkcaldy.JPG|thumb|left|Maggie's Centre, [[Fife]], designed by [[Zaha Hadid]]]]

===Fife===
The Maggie's Centre in [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]], opened in November 2006 at the [[Victoria Hospital (Kirkcaldy)|Victoria Hospital]]. The building was designed by [[Zaha Hadid]], and is her first built work in the UK.<ref>''Maggie's Centre, Kirkcaldy by Zaha Hadid'' Building Design online, 27 October 2006 [http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=3076101&origin=bdwknews]</ref> In the building there is emphasis placed on the transition between the natural and the man-made, and on the period between the hospital and home; the transition after having undergone treatment. There was an emphasis on clear and translucent glass, with powerfully sculptural cantilevers. The entrance facade is almost entirely made from glass. On the north side, the roof extension protects the entrance, while to the south, it provides shade. This can be seen as a fusion between form and function. Much thought has gone into the layout of the building, with the kitchen as the centre of the building and an informal atmosphere.

===London===
[[File:Maggie's Centre, Charing Cross, London.jpg|thumb|Maggie's Centre, London, designed by [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]]]]
The Maggie's Centre in [[London]] is located at [[Charing Cross Hospital]], west London. Opened in April 2008, the centre was designed by [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]] and was the first purpose-built Maggie's Centre in [[England]]. In May 2009 the centre won a [[RIBA]] award for architectural excellence and was named as London Project of the Year.<ref>''Rogers deserves recognition for this delightful building'' London Evening Standard, 21 May 2009 [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23696364-details/Rogers+deserves+recognition+for+this+delightful+building/article.do]</ref> On October 17, 2009 Richard Rogers and his team at Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners were awarded the [[Stirling Prize]] for the building, and subsequently donated the £20,000 prize money to the cancer care centre.

===Cheltenham===
Maggie's Cheltenham, beside [[Cheltenham General Hospital]], was opened by [[HRH The Duchess of Cornwall]] in October 2010. The centre was designed by [[Richard MacCormac|Sir Richard MacCormac]] of [[MJP Architects]], and the landscaping by Dr Christine Facer.<ref>''Duchess of Cornwall opens Cheltenham cancer care centre'' BBC News, 19 October 2010 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-11572873]</ref>

===Nottingham===
[[File:Maggies Cancer Care Center at Nottingham City Hospital.JPG|thumb|Nottingham, architect [[Piers Gough]]]]
Completed in 2011 [[Piers Gough]]'s imaginative and bold building for Nottingham's Maggies offers a " light, peaceful and non-institutional design (to) be a sanctuary for all those who walk through the door. Sheltered by trees, the centre (is) a homely, comfortable space next to the busy hospital, where anyone affected by cancer can come to relax. The centre is a safe space where visitors can engage with nature while being sheltered from the elements. From the outside the playful appearance entice(s) people to take a look through the door; once they do the harmony of light and space will create a uniquely welcoming environment.”<ref>http://www.maggiescentres.org/centres/nottingham/introduction.html</ref>

===South West Wales===
Maggie's South West Wales Centre at Singleton Hospital in [[Swansea]] was designed by the late Japanese Architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]] shortly before his death in 2007. The executive architects were [http://www.garbersjames.com/ Garbers and James] while the landscape design by Kim Wilkie was realised by [http://www.terrafirmaconsultancy.com Terra Firma]. The centre was opened in December 2011 by First Minister Carwyn Jones in the presence of guests of honour, Japanese ambassador Keiichi Hayashi, the family of architect Kisho Kurokawa, and Welsh footballer [[John Hartson]].

==Online Centre==
In addition to its established centres, Maggie's also has an Online Centre, free for anyone affected by cancer to use. The centre acts as a way for people to meet others in similar circumstances, support each other, learn about healthy living and relaxation and also get help in coping with difficult emotions.
