'''Edgar Hull, Jr.''' (February 20, 1904 &ndash; October 24, 1984), was a [[physician]] from [[Louisiana]] and in 1931 a founding faculty member of the [[Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans|Louisiana State University Medical Center]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].<ref name=lahist>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site25.php|title=Hull, Edgar|publisher=[[Louisiana Historical Association]], ''A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography''|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}</ref> In 1966, he became the first Dean of the  Louisiana State University School of Medicine at Shreveport (now the [[Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport]]).<ref name="lahist"/> After his retirement, Hull contradicted the [[historian]] [[T. Harry Williams]]' account of the [[assassination]] and death of [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[Huey Long]].<ref name=lahist/>

==Early years==
Hull was born in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]] in [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]] in southern [[Mississippi]], the son of Edgar Hull, Sr., and the former Alice Christine Rourke. He graduated from Pascagoula High School and studied pre-medicine from 1920–1921 and 1922-1923 at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. In between those years, he was a temporary [[schoolteacher]] at Bayou Cassotte in Jackson County, Mississippi.  From 1923-1927, Hull attended the [[Tulane University School of Medicine]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], from which he received his medical credentials. Hull then interned at the 108-bed Highland Sanitarium in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], the seat of [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]] in northwestern Louisiana. He stayed there for only six months before launching a private practice from 1929 to 1931 in  [[Pleasant Hill, Louisiana|Pleasant Hill]] in [[DeSoto Parish, Louisiana|DeSoto Parish]].<ref name=lahist/> 

In 1930, Hull married the former Louise Parham (died 1937) of Shreveport in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], Louisiana.<ref name=lahist/>

==Medical school pioneer==
On October 7, 1931, he returned to New Orleans and became one of the founding staff and faculty at the new LSU Medical Center, affiliated with Charity Hospital. In 1944, Hull was a Markle Fellow to [[Costa Rica]] and [[Guatemala]]. From 1950-1951, he was a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Professor]] to the [[University of Bologna]] in [[Bologna, Italy|Bologna]], [[Italy]]. In 1958, he was a consultant to [[Taiwan]]. He also performed consulting work in New Orleans at [[Touro Infirmary]] and Baptist Hospital. Shortly after Louise's death, he married the former Mallory Page Warren (1904–1986).<ref name=lahist/> Hull was acting head of the LSU School of Medicine in 1939 and chief administrator from 1940–1954 and 1960-1966. In between from 1954–1960, he was the medical school associate dean.<ref name=lahist/>
 
Hull was a pioneer in [[electrocardiography]] and a master of the American College of Physicians, a member of the American College of Gastroenterology, the American College of Cardiology, and the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] Physicians Guild. In 1966, he returned after many years to Shreveport to head the new LSU School of Medicine, which opened in 1969 partly in the facility of the former Confederate Memorial Medical Center. He worked to obtain national accreditation for what was only the second public medical school in Louisiana. He was the dean of the Shreveport campus from 1966–1973, when he retired at the age of sixty-nine to Pascagoula.<ref name=lahist/>

==Recalling Huey Long==
Hull reserved his comments on Huey Long's demise until after 1981, when the LSU Medical Center celebrated its 50th anniversary. His public recollections are incorporated in his 1983 memoirs entitled ''This I Remember: An Informal History of the Louisiana State University Medical Center in New Orleans.'' Unlike the LSU historian Williams, Hull claimed that after the shooting Long probably could not have been saved by any medical treatment. Moreover, Hull denied that Long died from medical or surgical incompetence.<ref name=lahist/> Hull also criticized his own conduct in the 1935 events surrounding Long's passing at the age of forty-two. Hull had called for an [[autopsy]] of the senator but not repeatedly, and he allowed himself to be overruled in the resulting tense situation.<ref name=lahist/>

==Death and legacy==
Hull died at the age of eighty in Pascagoula and is interred there at Greenwood Cemetery.<ref name=lahist/><ref>''A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'' bases its sketch of Dr. Hull on his memoirs; ''Directory of Medical Specialists,'' XIII (1968-1969); ''Louisiana's Family Doctor'', XIII (1966), 18-21; ''American Men and Women of Science'', 13th ed., III (1976); ''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'', obituary, October 27, 1984; and ''Orleans Parish Medical Society Bulletin'', (December 1984). Hull's public comments on Long's death were carried in ''L.S.U. Medical Alumni News'' (Fall 1983); the ''Times-Picayune'' carried a report on Hull, December 20, 1983; the [[Associated Press]] followed suit on December 21, 1983, with a Shreveport dateline.</ref>

Edgar and Mallory Page Hull had one son, the physician Edgar Warren Hull (born 1940) of Pascagoula.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carionltd.com/docfind.php?st=ms&letter=h&count=7|title=Doctors in MS for Letter H Hotchkiss - Hull|publisher=carionltd.com|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref> Hull also had a daughter with Louise Parham, Alice Louise (born 1936), who graduated from the LSU School of Medicine in 1962.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of LSU School of Medicine New Orleans |last=Klein |first=Russell | coauthors= Victoria Barreto Harkin |year=2010 |publisher=AuthorHouse  |isbn=1-4520-3094-4 |page=116 |accessdate=February 4, 2011}}</ref>

Hull is remembered through the Edgar Hull Society, founded in 1999 at the LSU School of Medicine to promote the study of internal medicine. The society was founded by a student, Shamita Shah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/internal_medicine/EHS-web/index.htm|title=The Edgar Hull Society|publisher=medschool.suhsc.edu|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}</ref>
