'''Sir James Jay''' (1732–1815) was an [[Thirteen Colonies|American]] [[physician]] and [[politician]]. He was brother of [[John Jay]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. While initially a supporter of American independence, he later changed his views becoming a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] and went into exile in London after the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] recognised independence.

==Medicine and education activism==
He was born in [[New York City]], studied medicine, and became a practicing physician.

He was instrumental in obtaining the endowments for [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s projected college (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) in [[Philadelphia]] (with [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|William Smith]], 1755) and [[Columbia University|King's (now Columbia) College]], New York. For the purpose of soliciting contributions for the latter college, he visited [[England]] in 1762, where he was knighted by the king, [[George III of England|George III]], in 1763.<ref name=nie/><ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|Jay, James}}</ref>

His writings include two pamphlets relating to the collections made for the colleges in America (1771 and 1774) and ''Reflections and Observations on the [[Gout]]'' (1772).<ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|Jay, James|year=1905|vb=1}}</ref>

==Politics==
Jay sat as a member of the New York legislature during the early years of the [[American War of Independence]] where he was a supporter of independence. He actively promoted the [[bill of attainder|Bill of Attainder]] and Confiscation which the legislature passed on 22 October 1779 directed at 59 loyalists.<ref name=appletons>{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Jay, John|year=1892|author=[[John Jay (lawyer)|John Jay]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring02/attainder.cfm|title=A Patriot, A Traitor, and a Bill of Attainder|author=Jack Lynch|publisher=history.org}}</ref> This bill was an anathema to Jay's brother John who saw it as persecuting people for their opinions.<ref name=jones>{{Cite book|author=Thomas Jones|title=History of New York during the Revolutionary War|pages=538–540|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h4crAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA538}}</ref>

In 1782, James connived to get himself arrested by the British so he could present a plan of reconciliation with Great Britain, as he was very suspicious of the French. He was treated as a spy, and imprisoned. [[Guy Carleton]] released him and allowed him to go to England. This led to suspicions about his loyalties among the revolutionaries.<ref name=appletons/><ref name=dab>{{Cite DAB|Jay, John|year=1936}}</ref> In a letter to Peter Van Schaak of 17 September 1782, John stated that “If after making so much bustle in and for America, he has, as it is surmised, improperly made his peace with Britain, I shall endeavour to forget that my father has such a son.” In 1813, James presented a “Narrative” to Congress which insisted that in Europe he worked to implement plans to attack British commerce and ports.<ref name=jones/> After the Revolution, the brothers had little contact with one another.<ref name=dab/>
