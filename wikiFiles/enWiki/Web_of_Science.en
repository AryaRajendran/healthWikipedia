'''Web of Science''' is an online academic [[citation index]] provided by [[Thomson Reuters]]. It is designed for providing access to multiple databases,  cross-disciplinary research, and in-depth exploration of specialized subfields within an [[academic discipline|academic or scientific discipline]]. As a citation index, any cited paper will lead to any other literature ([[conference proceedings|book]], [[academic journal]], [[proceedings]], etc.) which currently, or in the past, cites this work. In addition, literature which shows the greatest impact in a field covered by Web of Science, or more than one discipline, can be selectively obtained. For example, a paper's influence can be determined by linking to all the papers that have cited it. In this way, current trends, patterns, and emerging fields of research can be assessed. Web of Science has indexing coverage from the year 1900 to the present.<ref name=oview>

==Coverage==
The multidisciplinary coverage encompasses 11,261 journals (September 5, 2009) selected on the basis of [[impact factor|impact evaluations]]. This selection includes [[open-access journal]]s and over 12,000 [[academic conference|conferences]] each year (2009),  spanning multiple [[academic discipline]]s. Coverage includes the [[science]]s, [[social science]]s, [[the arts|arts]], and humanities, and across disciplines.<ref name=oview/><ref name=facts/> Web of Science does not cover all journals, and its coverage in some fields is less complete than in others.

Furthermore, as of September 5, 2009 the total file size for Web of Science is 46.1 million records, which includes 727,549,189 cited references (July 2009). This database records 65 million citations are  attributed to its contents, per year. Finally, it is described as the largest accessible citation database.<ref name=facts>[http://wokinfo.com/realfacts/qualityandquantity/  Bulleted fact sheet]. Thomson Reuters. 2010.</ref>

Titles of foreign-language publications are translated into English and so cannot be found by searches in the original language.<ref name=harvard-search>{{Cite web

==Abstracting and indexing==
The following  types of literature are indexed: [[peer review]]ed journals, original research articles, reviews, editorials, chronologies, abstracts, as well as other areas. Disciplines included in this index are  [[agriculture]], [[biological sciences]], [[engineering]], medical and [[life sciences]], [[physics|physical]] and [[chemical sciences]], [[anthropology]], law, [[library science]]s, [[architecture]], dance, music, film, and theater. Six citation databases encompasses coverage of the above disciplines.<ref name=UoOL/><ref name=included>

==Citation databases==
Web of Science has six available databases:<ref name=included/>
*[[Science Citation Index Expanded]] covers more than 7,100 notable journals encompassing 150 disciplines. Coverage is from the year 1900 to the present day.
*[[Social Sciences Citation Index]] covers more than 2,470 journals encompassing 50 social science disciplines. Moreover, this index covers 3,500 notable scientific and technical journals. Range of coverage is from the year 1956 to the present day.
*[[Arts & Humanities Citation Index]] covers more than  1,395 arts and humanities journals, in addition to certain items from more than 6,000 scientific and social sciences journals.
*[[Conference Proceedings Citation Index]] covers more than 110,000 journals and book-based proceedings in two editions: Science and Social Science and Humanities, encompassing 256 disciplines.
*[[Index Chemicus]] indexes more than 2.6 million compounds. The range of coverage is from 1993 to present day.
*[[Current Chemical Reactions]] indexes over one million reactions, and the range of coverage is from 1986 to present day. The '' INPI '' archives from 1840 to 1985 are also indexed in this database.

== Contents ==
The six [[citation index|citation indices]] listed above contain references which have been cited by other articles. One may use such citations to undertake cited reference searching, that is, locating articles that cite an earlier, or current publication. One may also search  citation databases by topic, by author, by source title, and by address. Two chemical databases,  ''Index Chemicus'' and  ''Current Chemical Reactions'' allow for the creation of structure drawings, thus enabling users to locate [[chemical compound]]s and reactions.

Institutions such as universities and the research departments of large corporations generally access the Web of Science from the [[Web of Knowledge]] index.

==Century of Social Sciences==
Expanding the coverage of Web of Science in November 2009, Thomson Reuters introduced, or established, '''Century of Social Sciences'''. This service contains files which trace social science research back to the year 1900.<ref name=InfoToNov2009>"''Thomson Reuters introduces century of social sciences''".
