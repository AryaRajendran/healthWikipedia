'''DirectHit''' is a pharmacodiagnostic test used to determine the [[tumor]] sensitivity or resistance to [[drug]] [[regimen]]s recommended for the treatment of [[breast cancer]] by the [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.i-newswire.com/ccc-diagnostics-inc-to-present/42194|title=CCC Diagnostics, Inc to Present Breast Cancer Study Results at Paris Conference from i-Newswire.com|author=CCC Diagnostics|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/7/1017|title=Aiming for a Direct Hit: Combining Molecular Imaging with Targeted Cancer Therapy - The Journal of Nuclear Medicine|author=M.

DirectHit was developed by CCC Diagnostics Inc., a [[biotechnology]] company established by former researchers from [[Johns Hopkins University]]. DirectHit was launched on 14 January 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.directhittest.com/news1.html|title=News - Breast Cancer CCC Diagnostics - CCC Diagnostics LLC|author=DirectHit Test Panel|accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref> Currently, it is the only available test for predicting treatment outcomes for [[anticancer]] [[chemotherapy]] drugs for breast cancer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cccdiag.com/news|title=Personalized Breast Cancer Treatment|author=CCC Diagnostics LLC|accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref>

==Technology==
DirectHit is based on quantitative [[immunofluorescence]] [[Nuclear technology#Medical applications|technology]]. According to recent studies, quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) can be applied to the standardization of [[protein]] analysis, resulting in increased sensitivity and reproducibility.<ref name=r1/> It is important to be able to quantitate the expression of predictive factors in breast cancer, because response to therapy is often dependent upon the concentration of particular proteins within the tissue.<ref name=r2/><ref name=r3/>

DirectHit utilizes [[monoclonal antibodies]] (mAb) corresponding to each [[biomarker]] to stain the tumor tissue samples. Slides are evaluated with a computerized, [[fluorescence]] [[microscopy]] system . Digital images are acquired through a CCCD camera. An algorithm was developed to process and analyze the digital images allowing direct relation between the amount of a specific protein within the [[cancer cell]]s of the tumor and response to the corresponding drug. Quantitative measurement of up to five signals in a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] can be obtained.

==Clinical Trials==
The DirectHit Panel for Breast Cancer was validated in retrospective clinical trials conducted at The [[University of Maryland]] [[University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center|Greenebaum Cancer Center]] and [[Harbor Hospital#Services Offered|Harborview Cancer Center]] in [[Baltimore]], MD. One key biomarker was selected as a correspondent to each drug, These biomarkers were identified as playing a significant role in [[cancer]] processes and as bearing a mechanistic relation to the action of the specified drug. The drug groups used as treatment and their related biomarkers are as follows: Trastuzumab/HER-2/neu,<ref name=r4/><ref name=r5/><ref name=r6/> Antiestrogens/Estrogen Receptor,<ref name=r7/><ref name=r8/><ref name=r9/><ref name=r10/> Taxanes/beta-tubulin III,<ref name=r11/><ref name=r12/><ref name=r13/><ref name=r14/><ref name=r15/><ref name=r16/> 5FU/Thymidylate Synthase.<ref name=r17/><ref name=r18/><ref name=r19/><ref name=r20/>

In these trials DirectHit analysis of [[estrogen]] receptor and HER-2/neu displayed a higher predictive accuracy for treatment outcomes with anti estrogen drugs and Trastuzumab than standard methods. In addition DirectHit displayed exceptional predictive accuracy for chemotherapy response (88%). DirectHit also displayed an extreme specificity for predictions of drug resistance (100%).<ref name=r21/>

==Cost==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2011}}
The cost of the DirectHit Panel for Breast Cancer is $3500. The use of DirectHit could result in significant cost savings because physicians will be able to customize treatment regimens for patients, eliminating ineffective drugs that would have otherwise been prescribed
If a 50% treatment failure rate is assumed for standard chemotherapy, then the use of the DirectHit Test Panel for Breast Cancer could result in potential savings of approximately $466M in drug costs alone for 40,000 late stage cancer patients in the United States. If ancillary costs are also considered, DirectHit testing could result in a total savings of $566M - $666M.
