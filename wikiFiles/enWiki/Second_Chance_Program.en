The '''Second Chance Program''' is a controversial [[detoxification]] and [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] program based on the ideas of [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of the [[Church of Scientology]]. It focuses on individuals convicted of [[substance abuse]] offenses. The program utilizes a combination of saunas, vitamins, minerals and oils to tackle the effects of drug addiction. Other elements of the program aim to improve the educational and social abilities of inmates, and to instil a moral code for them to live by. First established in [[Baja California]] in 1995, it has attracted controversy over its methods and claimed success rates. 

The program was proposed – but was rejected – for prisons in the states of [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]] and [[New York]]. Between 1995 and 2009 it operated in prisons in the Mexican cities of [[Tijuana]] and [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]] and in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] in the [[United States]]. Its Mexican operations were closed down after it lost government funding. Its only US operation was terminated in January 2009 by the [[Mayor of Albuquerque]]. By that time it had received more than $1.5 million dollars in public funding, but on closing it left debts of over $672,000 to the federal, state and city governments.

Scientology's relationship with the Second Chance organization has been a particular focus of contention, as the program uses many elements of Hubbard's doctrines that originated in, and are still used by, the Church of Scientology. The involvement of [[Nevada Assembly]] member [[Sharron Angle]] with Second Chance was a significant issue in the [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010|2010 United States Senate election]]s.

==Background==

Second Chance was established by Rick Pendery, a former real-estate developer and veteran Scientologist.<ref name="Etter-Program">{{cite news|last=Etter|first=Lauren|title=Program for prisoners draws fire over Scientology|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07019/755193-28.stm|date=January 19, 2007|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> During the 1970s he worked for [[Narconon]],<ref name="About Rick Pendery">{{cite web|title=About Rick Pendery|url=http://www.rickpendery.net/|author=Pendery, Rick|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}</ref> a [[drug rehabilitation]] program linked with the Church of Scientology,<ref name="Proctor-Base" /> eventually becoming Executive Director for the US-wide organization.<ref name="About Rick Pendery" /> He also worked in an official capacity for [[Criminon]], a Scientology-related program for prisoners that is based on L. Ron Hubbard's works.<ref name="Proctor-Base" /> In 1995 he established Second Chance, described as a "non-profit corporation that rehabilitates offenders in the criminal justice system" utilising L. Ron Hubbard's methods.<ref name="About Rick Pendery" />

==Establishments and proposed establishments==

===Mexico===
[[File:Second Chance states map.png|right|400px|thumb|Overview of Second Chance's presence in the US and Mexico]]
Pendery unsuccessfully sought to open a Second Chance program in a US prison, but succeeded in establishing the program in the state prison at [[Ensenada, Baja California]] in 1995. It was funded partly with his own money and partly with financial support from the Mexican government.<ref name="Etter-Program">{{cite news|last=Etter|first=Lauren|title=Program for prisoners draws fire over Scientology|date=January 19, 2007|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> It was subsequently approved for use in the state prison at [[Tijuana]], though that program was suspended due to prisoner moves.<ref name="Garcia-US">{{cite news|title=U.S. officials to visit Mexico prison to get look at drug program|url=http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20021121-9999_1m21prisons.html|last=Sánchez|first=Enrique García|date=November 21, 2002|work=San Diego Union-Tribune}}</ref>

The program was publicized in the United States and elsewhere, attracting a series of official visitors. The Spanish judge [[Baltazar Garzón]] was among the visitors, and the government of [[Guatemala]] was reported to be interested in the program.<ref name="Garcia-US" /> In October 2001, two officials from [[Erie County Holding Center]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] visited Ensenada at a Scientology patron's expense.<ref name="Sommer-Helping" /> They were impressed enough to appeal for $700,000 to introduce Second Chance to their own prison, although lack of funds put the project on hold.<ref name="Sommer-Helping" /> 

The Ensenada program was eventually shut down after losing its government funding.<ref name="Etter-Program" />

===Arizona===

Legislators in Arizona expressed interest in Second Chance in 2000-2001. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] state representative Mark Anderson sponsored an amendment in 2000 that would have appropriated $1.5 million to fund a Second Chance program. However, the amendment was defeated after the head of the [[Arizona Department of Corrections]] was strongly critical of Second Chance in hearings before the Arizona Senate Judiciary Committee, in which he noted that no nationally recognized drug treatment expert or institution had studied the program. He was concerned about its ties to Scientology and its methods.<ref name="Silverman" /> 

Arizona State Senators Tom Smith and Christine Weason visited the Ensenada Second Chance facility in 2001 and declared themselves impressed by it, though neither sought to introduce legislation regarding Second Chance in their own state. They pushed for the state government or private donors to find funding to support Second Chance,<ref name="Silverman">{{cite news|last=Silverman|first=Amy|title=Lock Up, Rub Down: State lawmakers push dubious Mexican drug rehab program|work=Phoenix New Times|date=November 15, 2001}}</ref> but the government rejected this idea; the cost of the program, at $15,000 a head, was regarded as prohibitive.<ref name="Vogel-Scientology">{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Ed|title=Scientology rehab: Guinn's office not interested|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=February 15, 2003}}</ref>

===Nevada===

Second Chance was promoted in [[Nevada]] by Republican Assemblywoman [[Sharron Angle]] from [[Reno, Nevada]]. In February 2003 she proposed legislation to establish Second Chance in Nevada for female prisoners and invited 35 legislators to accompany her on a trip to Ensenada to see the program in operation there. She had already twice visited Ensenada, once with a group of women legislators and later with [[Nevada Department of Corrections]] Director Jackie Crawford. She was impressed with the facility and sought to authorize a demonstration project in Nevada, supported by funding from the federal government.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nevada lawmaker promotes prison program with Scientology link|publisher=The Associated Press|date=February 11, 2003}}</ref> It emerged that the trip to Ensenada was being underwritten by Randall Suggs,<ref>{{cite news|last=Kieckhefer|first=Ben|title=Nevada Assemblywoman reveals trip sponsor|publisher=The Associated Press|date=February 12, 2003}}</ref> an Arizona businessman and wealthy Scientologist who was later to play a major role in bankrolling Second Chance in New Mexico.<ref name="Etter-Program" /> 

Angle's involvement with Second Chance attracted significant media and political interest. Assembly Majority Leader, Democrat [[Barbara Buckley]], advised legislators to vote against Angle's proposal and the office of Republican Governor [[Kenny Guinn]] indicated that they wanted nothing to do with it.<ref name="Vogel-Scientology" /> Angle received little support for her proposal and dropped the plan, blaming Democratic opposition.<ref name="Vogel-Quest">{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Ed|title=Quest for anti-drug program dies|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=February 18, 2003}}</ref>

====2010 United States Senate election controversy====

In 2010, Second Chance again became the subject of controversy in relation to that year's [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010|United States Senate election in Nevada]]. Angle's previous support for Second Chance was used in [[attack ad]]s by [[Sue Lowden]], her opponent for the Republican nomination, and incumbent Democratic Senator [[Harry Reid]]. An advert by Lowden portrayed Second Chance as a cushy health spa with inmates wearing prison uniform being tended to by attractive masseuses. The voiceover asserted that "Career politician and Senate candidate Sharron Angle sponsored a bill that would have used tax dollars to give massages to prisoners."<ref>{{cite news|last=Pearce|first=Ed|title=Adwatch: Spas, Massages and Politics |url=http://www.kolotv.com/news/headlines/95468544.html?ref=544|date=June 2, 2010|publisher=KOLO TV}}</ref> The same line of attack was used in a Harry Reid ad: "That's Sharron Angle. First, a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners. Now she wants to get rid of Medicare and Social Security. What's next?"<ref>{{cite news|last=Robison|first=Mark|title=Fact checker: To prove ads wrong, Angle must offer a plan|url=http://www.rgj.com/article/20100620/NEWS20/6200341/1321/news/Fact-checker--To-prove-ads-wrong--Angle-must-offer-a-plan|date=June 20, 2010|work=Reno Gazette-Journal}}</ref>

During a [[KVBC]]-hosted debate on the program "Face to Face with Jon Ralston", Angle was asked by Ralston "about recent whispers that an Angle legislative proposal to explore a program of massages and sweat-boxes for Nevada prisons was a strange foray into Scientology." Angle responded, "This program had a recividism rate of less than 10 percent. They aren’t massages. ... it was more of a karate chop. The sauna was a sweat box. When you’re in there with 30 guys it’s not exactly a sauna."<ref name="coolican">{{cite news| last = Coolican | first =J.

===New Mexico===

In 2002, Pendery gave a presentation on Second Chance to a conference of the [[National Foundation of Women Legislators]] being held in [[San Diego]], [[California]]. Sixty of them accepted his invitation to visit Ensenade to inspect the program. One of them, New Mexico Republican Anna Crook, was sufficiently impressed to ask the [[New Mexico Corrections Department]] to establish a pilot program. The department declined but Crook managed to obtain $350,000 for Second Chance from the 2004 federal appropriations bill. The majority of the remaining $300,000 required to fund the program was donated by Randall Suggs, a Scientologist who owned a stake in the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] baseball team. Another $300,000 was later allocated by the state of New Mexico.<ref name="Etter-Program" /> Crook convinced other New Mexico legislators to pass a bill allowing judges to sentence offenders to Second Chance in lieu of prison. To be eligible, inmates had to be facing imprisonment of six months to a year and had to have been diagnosed with chronic substance abuse problems. Prisoners with serious medical conditions or who had committed violent or sex offenses would not be accepted.<ref name="Proctor-Drug" />

The program was established in [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico. W. John Brennan, a former chief district judge who had been convicted in 2004 of drunk driving and cocaine possession, was hired by Second Chance as its President and was given the task of lobbying New Mexico judges to send inmates to attend the program.<ref name="Etter-Program" /> Second Chance received its first inmate in September 2006.<ref name="Etter-Program" /> In its first year it had several hundred referrals and on average housed about 65 inmates at a time in the old West Side jail in Albuquerque.<ref name="Proctor-Second">{{cite news|last=Proctor|first=Jeff|url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2141874/?lid=right-news-4|title=Second Chance removes last inmates from old jail building|date=January 25, 2009|work=Albuquerque Journal|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}</ref> Jurisdictions that sent inmates to Second Chance included [[Socorro County, New Mexico|Socorro]], [[Grant County, New Mexico|Grant]], [[Taos County, New Mexico|Taos]] and [[Sierra County, New Mexico|Sierra]] counties.<ref>{{cite news|last=Proctor|first=Jeff|title=Judges Differ on Second Chance|url=http://www.journalwest.com/1011553west01-10-09.htm|date=January 10, 2009|work=Albuquerque Journal|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}</ref>

Although the program had some support, mainly from rural parts of the state, it was controversial from the start. The program's unconventional methods, unwillingness to disclose its finances and ties to Scientology aroused controversy,<ref name="Proctor-Second" /> although Second Chance officials and a Scientology spokesperson said that there were no ties.<ref name="Etter-Program" /> Judge William Lang, the chief district judge in the Albuquerque area, was "highly suspicious" of the program. Lang cautioned many of New Mexico's district judges about the program, arguing that funding for treatment should go to existing programs that have a track record.<ref name="Etter-Program" /> He said that he was concerned by Second Chance's use of unlicensed substance abuse professionals, that its administrators were vague about its treatment model and that its corporate structure was unclear.<ref name="Proctor-Drug">{{cite news|author1=Proctor, Jeff|author2=Sandlin, Scott|title=Drug Offender Center Met With Skepticism|work=Albuquerque Journal|date=September 3, 2006}}</ref>  Sheriff Darren White [[Bernalillo County]] told the ''Albuquerque Journal'' that he was "very, very skeptical" about Second Chance and would prefer the criminal justice system to "fund what we already know works."<ref name="Proctor-Drug" /> Some judges, unconvinced of its effectiveness, refused to refer offenders.<ref name="Etter-Program" />

====Financial difficulties====

Second Chance faced increasing financial difficulties from its second year of operations. W. John Brennan distanced himself from Second Chance, criticizing the way it was being operated and managed. By the end of 2007, Bernalillo County had ceased sending prisoners to the program and Second Chance's income from state funding was below the anticipated level. To make up for the shortfall, Second Chance began "jail shopping" in 2008 – offering rural counties the chance to offload their overflow inmates, including women, at a discounted rate. It appealed to the New Mexico legislature for $3.6 million of further funding.<ref name="Proctor-Second" /> Although the proposal was again supported by state representative Anna Crook,<ref name="Herzenberg-Second">{{cite news|last=Herzenberg|first=Michael|title=Second Chance seeks state boost|publisher=KRQE News|date=February 21, 2007}}</ref> Second Chance was awarded only $600,000 in July 2008.<ref name="Proctor-Second" /> More money was raised from private donors but this was insufficient to cover expenses.<ref name="Proctor-Second" /> It laid off employees, missed payroll deadlines and was ordered by a court to pay $78,000 after failing to pay for its video security system.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff|title=NM rehab center housing overflow inmates|url=http://www.correctionsone.com/news/1843470-NM-rehab-center-housing-overflow-inmates/|work=Albuquerque Journal|date=December 18, 2008}}</ref> An additional blow came when Brennan was forced to resign from his post as President of Second Chance after being charged with committing false imprisonment and battery on a household member.<ref name="Herzenberg-Rehab" /> 

The effectiveness and methods of the program was also questioned. A study carried out by the [[University of New Mexico]] found that the program was taking in violent offenders, in violation of its criteria, and that judges sending inmates to the program were unclear about its mandate.<ref name="Herzenberg-Study" /> Following the presentation of the study to the New Mexico Legislature, [[Curry County, New Mexico|Curry County]] commissioners decided to end their contract with Second Chance. The commissioners stated that Second Chance had billed the county $4,500 without a signed contract and was not sending requested progress reports on the inmates in their care.<ref name="Johnson-Commissioners">{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Sharna|title=Commissioners decline to pursue rehabilitation program|url=http://www.cnjonline.com/news/commissioners-30446-county-rehabilitation.html|work=Clovis News Journal|date=October 7, 2008}}</ref>

====Investigation and termination====

In November 2008, state officials expressed concern that the program had become a "dumping ground" for prisoners from around the state, including those convicted of violent felonies.<ref name="Proctor-Second" /> Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren White commented: "They were established as a treatment facility and not a jail, and it appears to me that it's being run as such."<ref>{{cite news|title=Official backs off Second Chance inmates|last=Herzenberg|first=Michael|url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/politics/politics_krqe_albuquerque_official_backs_off_second_chance_inmates_200812192355|publisher=KRQE News|date=December 19, 2008}}</ref> Albuquerque Mayor [[Martin Chávez]] ordered an investigation to establish the status of the inmates and Second Chance was given a deadline in December 2008 to account for its inmates.<ref name="Bohman-Second" /> 

However, Albuquerque Public Safety Director Pete Dinelli accused Second Chance of transferring inmates out of the facility just before the deadline expired.<ref name="Bohman-Second" /> According to city officials, 40 inmates were bused to an Albuquerque homeless shelter and another eight inmates were loaded into a van and taken out of the county.<ref name="Inmates Moved">{{cite news|title=Second Chance Inmates Moved: 8 Are Driven Away in Van; 40 People Taken to Shelter|work=Albuquerque Journal|date=December 25, 2008}}</ref> The city's chief of police reported:

{{quote|"Acting upon a tip that inmates were going to be moved this morning from the Second Chance Center located on the West Mesa, I had personnel monitor the area. This morning between 7 and 10:30, officers observed 40 persons transported from Second Chance to St. Martin's Hospitality Center in Albuquerque. Additionally eight individuals were loaded in a van. The van was followed west on I-40 to the city limits. The van continued west from there to an unknown location."<ref name="Inmates Moved" />}}

The eight had been convicted of violent crimes; Dinelli commented that Second Chance appeared to be "deliberately deciding not to include those eight individuals. And to me failure to disclose is just as good as lying." It also emerged that Second Chance had violated its lease by building a large sauna inside the facility without permission.<ref name="Bohman-Second">{{cite news|last=Bohman|first=Dave|title=Second Chance responds to allegations|url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/politics/politics_krqe_albuquerque_second_chance_responds_to_allegations_20081225|publisher=KRQE News|date=December 25, 2008|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref>

Second Chance's lease was terminated by the city a few days later. Mayor Chávez said: "They simply didn't live up to their end of the agreement", citing Second Chance's housing of violent inmates and the apparent attempt to cover this up.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bohman|first=Dave|title=City pulls plug on Second Chance|url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/politics/politics_krqe_albuquerque_city_pulls_plug_on_second_chance_200812262319|publisher=KRQE News|date=December 28, 2008|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref> He accused Second Chance of misleading city and state officials, saying: "This program has been based on misrepresentation and deceit, and, frankly, I can't see how that would be the basis for a good recovery program."<ref name="Proctor-Base">{{cite news|last=Proctor|first=Jeff|title=Scientology Base Denied By Officials|url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2141873/?lid=right-news-5|work=Albuquerque Journal|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}</ref> He was strongly critical of Second Chance's attempt to "avoid our oversight, our scrutiny" and said: "It's very evident to me that they were attempting to avoid oversight by taxpayers. This is not going to be tolerated." The notice of termination also accused Second Chance of misusing its facility as a jail rather than as a substance abuse rehabilitation center.<ref>{{cite news|last=Proctor|first=Jeff|title=Mayor Evicts Second Chance: Center Violated Its Lease, City Says|url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2100782/|work=Albuquerque Journal|date=December 28, 2008|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}</ref>

The program was terminated with effect from January 31, 2009, and the remaining 20 or so inmates were returned to their original jurisdictions. Second Chance made an unsuccessful last-minute appeal to legislators to save it from closure.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rehab Center Tries To Garner Support: Letters Sent To State Legislators|url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2104788/|work=Albuquerque Journal|date=January 1, 2009|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref> By November 2008, it had received more than $1.5 million dollars in public funding<ref name="Herzenberg-Study" /> but by March 2009 it was reported to owe over $672,000 to the state, the city and the IRS in tax liens, utility bills and unpaid rent.<ref name="Owes">{{cite news|title=Records: Second Chance Owes $672K: City, State, IRS Among Unpaid|url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2232972/|work=Albuquerque Journal|date=March 20, 2009|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref>

==Corporate structure and links with Scientology==

The Second Chance program in Albuquerque was operated by two entities, against which tax liens were levied by the IRS and the state of New Mexico. The entities were Second Chance Program Inc., and Second Chance Center New Mexico LLC. Second Chance Program Inc. is a private nonprofit company while Second Chance Center is a private for-profit corporation. However, neither Second Chance's President Joy Westrum nor her husband, executive director Rick Pendery, have explained the roles or functions of the two entities.<ref name="Owes" /> Chief District Judge William Lang complained in 2006 that he was unclear about the corporate structure of Second Chance.<ref name="Proctor-Drug" />

From the start of Second Chance's involvement with the prison system in the United States, its close ties with Scientology have been a controversial issue. The materials used by Second Chance are licensed from [[Criminon]], another Scientology-related organization.<ref name="Sommer-Helping">{{cite news|last=Sommer|first=Mark|title=Helping Spread the Word|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/JeremyPerkins/Articles/buffalo-news-2005-02-01.html|date=February 1, 2005|work=The Buffalo News}}</ref> Its officials denied that it was based on Scientology. Joy Westrum said in 2007 that it was "utilizes a protocol that is based on the discoveries of Mr. Hubbard. Second Chance is a completely secular program."<ref name="Herzenberg-Second" /> 

However, according to former and current Second Chance employees interviewed by the ''Albuquerque Journal'', "everything that happens there is based in Scientology." Inmates and employees were required to go through courses and "ethics training" that were taken directly from Scientology; Scientology-related entities played a major role in operations at Second Chance; the program was predominately funded by wealthy Scientologist donors; and the program materials were taken directly from Narconon and Criminon, both run by Scientologists and classified by the IRS as "scientology-related entities". Several employees told the ''Journal'' that the program was merely a "front group" for Scientology. The Mayor of Albuquerque, Martin Chavéz, commented: "It was always represented to us that this program was totally secular, but that some of it was based on L. Ron Hubbard's teachings ... If in fact what they were doing out there was teaching people directly out of L. Ron Hubbard's books, well, that just adds fuel to the fire."<ref name="Proctor-Base" />

==Methodology==

The Second Chance Program consists of five core modules, combining course materials from [[Criminon]] and [[Narconon]], two other Scientology-related entities:

* Drug Rehabilitation Module
* Study Skills Module
* Self Respect Module
* Life Skills Module
* Reintegration Module<ref name="Guerin-Study">{{cite web|title=Second Chance Center Preliminary Process Evaluation Study|format=PDF|last=Guerin, Paul|publisher=Institute for Social Research,  University of New Mexico|date=October 2008}}</ref>

The first four modules are delivered in the facility, while the final Reintegration Module begins in the facility and continues after release. Each of the modules consists of a number of courses, as summarized below:<ref name="Guerin-Study" />

The program makes extensive use of saunas. In the case of the New Mexico Second Chance program, inmates spent four hours a day in the sauna, interrupted only by short breaks to drink water, eat raw vegetables or take a shower. The sauna sessions were preceded by exercise. Inmates were also required to take large doses of vitamins, minerals and olive oil. Participants perform "nerve assists" - a type of [[laying on of hands]] - on each other.<ref name="Garcia-Taking" />

The communication drills involve inmates sitting in pairs, three feet apart, and going through a series of exercises that can last for hours at a time. Some involve sitting face-to-face, eyes closed, in total silence. Others involve a technique called "bull-baiting", where one insults the other, who is expected to remain silent.<ref name="Garcia-Taking" /> The ''[[Santa Fe Reporter]]'' gave an example:

{{quote|"You stupid fat ass!" one goatee-wearing inmate blurts out at his pot-bellied "twin." When the recipient of the insult starts laughing, his provoking partner yells, "Flunk!"<ref name="Garcia-Taking" />}}

Another drill requires inmates to sit opposite each other, look each other in the eye and read lines from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''.<ref name="Etter-Program" />

===Theoretical basis===

Second Chance's program is based on what are said to be "secular discoveries" made by L. Ron Hubbard.<ref name="Proctor-Base" /> In particular, it draws on five key elements – the [[Purification Rundown]],<ref name="Proctor-Base" /> [[Study Technology]],<ref name="About-SCP">{{cite web|title=About the Second Chance Program|work=The Truth About Second Chance|url=http://www.thetruthaboutsecondchance.com/about_second_chance.html|accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> Hubbard's book ''[[The Way to Happiness]]'',<ref name="Proctor-Base" /> communication drills originally developed for [[Auditing (Scientology)|Scientology auditing]] and an [[Ethics (Scientology)|ethical framework derived from Scientology]].

The sauna-based part of the program is based on Hubbard's belief that the body's [[fatty tissue]] accumulate drugs and other toxins over time. This is said to contribute to cravings, which make it harder to overcome addiction.<ref name="Garcia-Taking" /> The use of vitamins, minerals and oils is supposed to dislodge toxins stored in body fat, which is then sweated out during sauna sessions. However, this belief has been criticized by medical experts. Professor [[William R. Miller (psychologist)|Bill Miller]] of the University of New Mexico told the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that he did not know of any scientific basis for it, and commented: "It wasn't clear to me what sort of scientific basis there was even for the conception of the program to begin with."<ref name="Etter-Program" /> A similar program was reviewed by the [[National Council Against Health Fraud]], which found that such detoxification methods do the opposite of what Hubbard claimed. Instead of releasing fat into the bloodstream, high doses of [[niacin]] block the release of fat and can damage the liver.<ref name="Silverman" />

According to Second Chance, it uses "cutting-edge study technology from [[Applied Scholastics]]",<ref name="About-SCP" /> another Scientology-related organization. Study Technology is based on the idea that there are three fundamental barriers to learning. These are said to be a "lack of mass", when there is no object to illustrate a concept; a "skipped gradient", when difficult material needs to be studied incrementally, and a "misunderstood word", which can be resolved by using dictionaries in a process called "word clearing."<ref name=Helfand-Hubbard>{{cite news|last=Helfand|first=Duke|title=Special Report: Hubbard Teachings in Public Classrooms|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 27, 1997}}</ref> David G.

The British sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] comments that Study Technology forms a key element of Scientology indoctrination by "assist[ing] those who are slow in grasping the principles of the movement." Its underlying principle is that a failure to understand a text is due not to the text being faulty – such as it being nonsensical – but because the reader has failed to understand a word or concept. Thereby, Wallis notes, "the individual learns to doubt his own judgement; to locate some meaning in the undoubted mystification of much of Hubbard's writing; or to acquiesce to some half-comprehended and yet half-incomprehensible statement in the hope that all will be made clear to him at some later point." The extreme tedium of "word clearing" leads, in Wallis's view, to "a further suspension of the individual's critical faculty, or to its inhibition, and to the ready acceptance of Hubbard's formulations as intrinsically meaningful."<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=Roy|title=The Road to Total Freedom: A Sociological Analysis of Scientology|pages=231–232|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|isbn=0-435-82916-5}}</ref>

''The Way To Happiness'' is described by Joy Westrum of Second Chance as "a nonreligious moral code written by L.

Criminon's ''Ups and Downs in Life'' course, which Second Chance uses, teaches the concept of "[[Suppressive Person]]s" and "Potential Trouble Sources".<ref name="Urban Institute">{{cite book|title=The Criminon Program Evaluation: Phase I|url=http://www.criminon.org/studies/urban_institute_phase1.pdf|author1=La Vigne, Nancy G.|author2=Naser, Rebecca L.|author3=Owens, Colleen|publisher=Urban Institute Justice Policy Center|date=January 2006}}</ref> These concepts come from Scientology. Ruth A. Tucker wrote that the concept appeared to have first been introduced into Scientology in the 1960s "as membership grew and as authoritarian control [by Hubbard] increased." Tucker notes that many of those who joined Scientology during this period were "well-educated people who prided themselves in independent thinking [who] struggled with the idea of allowing any other individual to completely dominate their opinions."<ref>Ruth A.

==Claimed success rates and certifications==

An investigation in 2008 by New Mexico news television station [[KRQE]] found that Second Chance had a success rate far below what was claimed. Although it claimed that only 10% of its graduates went on to reoffend, Second Chance's own figures obtained by KRQE showed that the recidivism rate was closer to 32%. Some of the failures were among Second Chance's own instructors, six of whom had subsequently been charged with offenses ranging from drug dealing to smuggling contraband into a jail.<ref name="Herzenberg-Rehab">{{cite news|last=Herzenberg|first=Michael|title=Rehab center carries low success rate|url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/search/Rehab_center_carries_low_success_rate_386160|date=July 21, 2008|publisher=KRQE News}}</ref> A study carried out by the University of New Mexico found that within 100 days of graduation, 8.6% of Second Chance graduates committed new crimes and 22.9% violated their probations.<ref name="Herzenberg-Study">{{cite news|last=Herzenberg|first=Michael|title=Study questions drug-treatment results|url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/politics/politics_krqe_santa_fe_study_questions_drug_treatment_results_200811180035_rev1|publisher=KRQE News|date=November 18, 2008|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}</ref> Officials in Curry County, New Mexico stated that thirteen inmates from the county had undergone the program but only three graduated, two of whom subsequently returned to jail.<ref name="Johnson-Commissioners" />

A different study of Second Chance in Mexico by Dr. Alfonso Paredes claimed that the program had a recidivism rate for those who completed the program of less than 10 percent. However, the ''Albuquerque Journal'' noted that Dr. Paredes was reported to have studied Scientology<ref name="Proctor-Base" /> (he is listed as having achieved the Scientology status of "[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]" in 1991<ref>{{cite journal|title=Scientology Service Completions|work=Source|publisher=Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization|issue=74|date=February 1991}}</ref>) and he is also on the advisory board of Narconon.<ref name=Garcia-Taking>{{cite news|last=Garcia|first=David Alire|title=Taking Chances|url=http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-1508-taking-chances.html|date=March 28, 2007|accessdate=July 3, 2010|work=Santa Fe Reporter}}</ref> The University of New Mexico criminologist, Paul Guerin, who carried out a study into Second Chance, was skeptical of the claims made by Paredes: "They need to drop this Mexican study. There's not a program ever that has produced those kinds of results."<ref name=Garcia-Taking />

As of March 2007, Second Chance was not certified by the [[Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities]] (CARF).<ref name=Garcia-Taking /> Second Chance's website lists certifications for Narconon, but none for itself.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Truth About Second Chance - Certifications|url=http://www.thetruthaboutsecondchance.com/certifications.html|accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref>
