There are many subtypes of ANAs such as [[anti-Ro antibodies]], [[anti-La antibodies]], [[anti-Sm|anti-Sm antibodies]], [[anti-nRNP|anti-nRNP antibodies]], [[anti-Scl-70 antibodies]], [[anti-dsDNA antibodies]], [[anti-histone antibodies]], antibodies to nuclear pore complexes,  [[anti-centromere antibodies]] and [[sp100 nuclear antigen|anti-sp100 antibodies]]. Each of these antibody subtypes bind to different proteins or protein complexes within the nucleus. They are found in many disorders including [[autoimmunity]], [[cancer]] and [[infection]], with different prevalences of antibodies depending on the condition. This allows the use of ANAs in the diagnosis of some autoimmune disorders, including [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[Sjögren's syndrome]], [[Scleroderma]], [[polymyositis]], [[dermatomyositis]], [[autoimmune hepatitis]] and [[drug-induced lupus erythematosus|drug induced lupus]].<ref name ="pmid10629135">Kavanaugh A, Tomar R, Reveille J, Solomon DH, Homburger HA.

Arch Pathol Lab Med 2000;124:71–81.PMID 10629135.</ref>

The ANA test detects the autoantibodies present in an individuals [[blood serum]]. The common tests used for detecting and quantifying ANAs are [[indirect immunofluorescence]] and [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA). In immunofluorescence, the level of autoantibodies are reported as a [[titer|titre]]. This is the highest dilution of the serum at which autoantibodies are still detectable. Positive autoantibody titres at a dilution equal to or greater than 1:160 are usually considered as clinically significant. Positive titres of less than 1:160 are present in up to 20% of the healthy population, especially the elderly. Although, positive titres of 1:160 or higher are strongly associated with autoimmune disorders, they are also found in 5% of healthy individuals. Autoantibody screening is usefull in the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and monitoring levels help to predict the progression of disease.<ref name ="pmid10629135"/><ref name="pmid19121207">{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Y|coauthors=Bhatia, A; Minz, RW|title=Antinuclear antibodies and their detection methods in diagnosis of connective tissue diseases: a journey revisited.|journal=Diagnostic pathology|date=2009 Jan 2|volume=4|pages=1|pmid=19121207}}</ref><ref name="pmid12848970">{{cite journal |author=Yamamoto K|title=Pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome |journal=Autoimmun Rev |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=13–8 |year=2003|month=January |pmid=12848970 |doi=|url=}}</ref>

==Immunity and autoimmunity==
The human body has many defence mechanisms against [[pathogen]]s, one of which is [[humoral immunity]]. This defence mechanism produces [[antibodies]] (large [[glycoproteins]]) in response to an immune stimulus. Many cells of the immune system are required for this process, including [[lymphocyte]]s ([[T-cell]]s and [[B-cell]]s) and [[antigen presenting cell]]s. These cells coordinate an immune response upon the detection of foreign proteins ([[antigen]]s), producing antibodies that bind to these antigens. In normal physiology, lymphocytes that recognise human proteins ([[autoantigen]]s) either undergo programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) or become non-functional. This [[self-tolerance]] means that lymphocytes should not incite an immune response against human cellular antigens. Sometimes, however, this process malfunctions and antibodies are produced against human antigens, which may lead to autoimmune disease.<ref name ="isbn080537146X"/>

==ANA subtypes==
ANAs are found in many disorders, as well as some healthy individuals. These disorders include: [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE), [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Sjögren's syndrome]], [[scleroderma]], [[polymyositis]], [[dermatomyositis]], [[primary biliary cirrhosis]], [[drug-induced lupus erythematosus|drug induced lupus]], [[Raynaud's phenomenon]], [[autoimmune hepatitis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[discoid lupus]], [[thyroid disease]], [[fibromyalgia]], [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], [[juvenile idiopathic arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[juvenile dermatomyositis]], [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura|idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura]], [[infection]] and [[cancer]]. These antibodies can be subdivided according to their specificity, and each subset has different propensities for specific disorders.<ref name ="pmid10629135"/><ref name="pmid20961429">{{cite journal |author=Malleson PN, Mackinnon MJ, Sailer-Hoeck M, Spencer CH |title=Review for the generalist: The antinuclear antibody test in children – When to use it and what to do with a positive titer |journal=Pediatr Rheumatol Online J |volume=8 |issue= |pages=27 |year=2010|pmid=20961429 |pmc=2987328 |doi=10.1186/1546-0096-8-27 |url=}}</ref>

===Extractable nuclear antigens===
[[Extractable nuclear antigen]]s (ENA) are a group of [[autoantigen]]s that were originally identified as antibody targets in people with autoimmune disorders. They are termed ENA because they can be extracted from the cell nucleus with saline.<ref name ="pmid10629135"/><ref name="pmid16338206">{{cite journal|last=Damoiseaux|first=JG|coauthors=Tervaert, JW|title=From ANA to ENA: how to proceed?|journal=Autoimmunity reviews|date=2006 Jan|volume=5|issue=1|pages=10–7|pmid=16338206}}</ref> The ENAs consist of [[ribonucleoprotein]]s and non-[[histone]] proteins, named by either the name of the donor who provided the prototype serum (Sm, Ro, La, Jo), or the name of the disease setting in which the antibodies were found (SS-A, SS-B, Scl-70).<ref name="pmid11899137">{{cite journal|last=Wenzel|first=J|coauthors=Gerdsen, R; Uerlich, M; Bauer, R; Bieber, T; Boehm, I|title=Antibodies targeting extractable nuclear antigens: historical development and current knowledge.|journal=The British journal of dermatology|date=2001 Dec|volume=145|issue=6|pages=859–67|pmid=11899137}}</ref>

====Anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B====
[[File:SSA SSB ANA.jpg|thumb|Speckled [[Immunofluorescence]] staining pattern of anti-nuclear antibodies on HEp-20-10 cells. This staining pattern is seen with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies.]]
[[Anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies|Anti-Ro]] and [[Anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies|anti-La]] antibodies, also known as SS-A and SS-B, respectively, are commonly found in primary [[Sjögren's syndrome]]; an [[autoimmune disorder]]that affects the [[exocrine gland]]s. The presence of both antibodies are found in 30–60% of Sjögren's syndrome, anti-Ro antibodies alone are found in 50–70% of Sjögren's syndrome and 30% of SLE with cutaneous involvement, and anti-La antibodies are rarely found in isolation.<ref name="pmid19121207"/><ref name="pmid20833272">{{cite journal|last=Hernández-Molina|first=G|coauthors=Leal-Alegre, G; Michel-Peregrina, M|title=The meaning of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies in primary Sjögren's syndrome.|journal=Autoimmunity reviews|date=2011 Jan|volume=10|issue=3|pages=123–5|pmid=20833272}}</ref> Anti-La antibodies are also found in SLE, however Sjögren's syndrome is normally also present.<ref name="pmid15226160">{{cite journal|last=Kassan|first=SS|coauthors= Moutsopoulos, HM|title=Clinical manifestations and early diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome.|journal=Arch Intern Med.|date=2004 Jun|volume=164|issue=12|pages=1275–84|pmid=15226160}}</ref> Anti-Ro antibodies are also found less frequently in other disorders including autoimmune liver diseases, [[coeliac disease]], autoimmune rheumatic diseases, cardiac neonatal [[systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus erythematosus]] and [[polymyositis]].<ref name = "pmid20854935">{{cite journal|last=Defendenti|first=C|coauthors=Atzeni, F; Spina, MF; Grosso, S; Cereda, A; Guercilena, G; Bollani, S; Saibeni, S; Puttini, PS|title=Clinical and laboratory aspects of Ro/SSA-52 autoantibodies.|journal=Autoimmunity reviews|date=2011 Jan|volume=10|issue=3|pages=150–4|pmid=20854935}}</ref><ref name ="pmid15158743">{{cite journal|last=Venables|first=PJ|title=Sjögren's syndrome.|journal=Best practice & research.

The 60kDa [[DNA]]/RNA binding protein and 52kDa [[T-cell]] regulatory protein are the best characterised antigens of anti-Ro antibodies. Collectively, these proteins are part of a [[ribonucleoprotein]] (RNP) complex that associate with the hyRNAs, hY1-hY5. The La antigen is a 48kDa [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] termination factor of [[RNA polymerase III]], which associates with the Ro-RNP complex.<ref name="pmid11899137"/><ref name="pmid20833272"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Deshmukh|first=US|coauthors=Bagavant, H; Lewis, J; Gaskin, F; Fu, SM|title=Epitope spreading within lupus-associated ribonucleoprotein antigens.|journal=Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)|date=2005 Nov|volume=117|issue=2|pages=112–20|pmid=16095971}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ben-Chetrit|first=E|title=The molecular basis of the SSA/Ro antigens and the clinical significance of their autoantibodies.|journal=British journal of rheumatology|date=1993 May|volume=32|issue=5|pages=396–402|pmid=8495261}}</ref>

The mechanism of antibody production in Sjögren's syndrome is not fully understood, but apoptosis (programmed cell death) and [[molecular mimicry]] may play a role.<ref name="pmid12848970"/> The Ro and La antigens are expressed on the surface of cells undergoing apoptosis and may cause the inflammation within the salivary gland by interaction with cells of the immune system. The antibodies may also be produced through molecular mimicry, where cross reactive antibodies bind to both virus and human proteins. This may occur with one of the antigens, Ro or La, and may subsequently produce antibodies to other proteins through a process known as [[epitope spreading]]. The retroviral gag protein shows similarity to the La protein and is proposed as a possible example for molecular mimicry in Sjögren's syndrome.<ref name="pmid12848970"/><ref name ="pmid15158743"/>

==== Anti-Sm ====
Anti-Smith (Anti-Sm) antibodies are a very specific marker for SLE. Approximately 99% of individuals with anti-Sm antibodies have the disease, but only 20% of people with SLE have the antibodies. They are associated with [[central nervous system]] involvement, [[kidney disease]], [[lung fibrosis]] and [[pericarditis]] in SLE, but they are not associated with disease activity. The antigens of the anti-Sm antibodies are the core units of the [[snRNP|small nuclear ribonucleoprotein]]s (snRNPs), termed A to G, and will bind to the U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs. Most commonly, the antibodies are specific for the B, B' and D units.<ref name="pmid7604300">{{cite journal|last=von Mühlen|first=CA|coauthors=Tan, EM|title=Autoantibodies in the diagnosis of systemic rheumatic diseases.|journal=Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism|date=1995 Apr|volume=24|issue=5|pages=323–58|pmid=7604300}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Lyons|first=R|coauthors=Narain, S; Nichols, C; Satoh, M; Reeves, WH|title=Effective use of autoantibody tests in the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune disease.|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=2005 Jun|volume=1050|pages=217–28|pmid=16014537}}</ref> Molecular and epidemiological studies suggest that anti-Sm antibodies may be induced by molecular mimicry because the protein shows some similarity to [[Epstein-Barr virus]] proteins.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zieve|first=GW|coauthors=Khusial, PR|title=The anti-Sm immune response in autoimmunity and cell biology.|journal=Autoimmunity reviews|date=2003 Sep|volume=2|issue=5|pages=235–40|pmid=12965173}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Migliorini|first=P|coauthors=Baldini, C; Rocchi, V; Bombardieri, S|title=Anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies.|journal=Autoimmunity|date=2005 Feb|volume=38|issue=1|pages=47–54|pmid=15804705}}</ref>

====Anti-nRNP/anti-U1-RNP====
[[anti-nRNP|Anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein (anti-nRNP) antibodies]], also known as anti-U1-RNP antibodies, are found in 30–40% of SLE. They are often found with anti-Sm antibodies, but they may be associated with different clinical associations. In addition to SLE, these antibodies are highly associated with [[mixed connective tissue disease]]. Anti-nRNP antibodies recognise the A and C core units of the snRNPs and because of this they primarily bind to the U1-snRNP.<ref name="pmid7604300"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Benito-Garcia|first=E|coauthors=Schur, PH; Lahita, R; American College of Rheumatology Ad Hoc Committee on Immunologic Testing, Guidelines|title=Guidelines for immunologic laboratory testing in the rheumatic diseases: anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibody tests.|journal=Arthritis and rheumatism|date=2004 Dec 15|volume=51|issue=6|pages=1030–44|pmid=15593352}}</ref> The immune response to RNP may be caused by the presentation of the nuclear components on the cell membrane in apoptotic blebs.

====Anti-Jo-1====
Although anti-Jo-1 antibodies are often included with ANAs, they are actually antibodies to the cytoplasmic protein, [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase|histidyl tRNA sythetase]].<ref name="pmid16338206"/> They are highly associated with [[polymyositis]] and [[dermatomyositis]], and are rarely found in other connective tissue diseases. Around 20–40% of polymyositis is positive for Jo-1 antibodies and most will have interstitial lung disease, HLA-DR3 and HLA-DRw52 [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) markers; collectively known as Jo-1 syndrome.<ref name="pmid7604300"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=WA|coauthors=Wetzel, W; Friedländer, R; Lange, R; Sörensen, HF; Lichey, HJ; Genth, E; Mierau, R; Gromnica-Ihle, E|title=Clinical and serological aspects of patients with anti-Jo-1 antibodies—an evolving spectrum of disease manifestations.|journal=Clinical rheumatology|year=2000|volume=19|issue=5|pages=371–7|pmid=11055826}}</ref>

===Anti-dsDNA===
[[File:ANA - dsDNA antibody.png|thumb|dsDNA antibody. The variable regions (yellow) are complementary to the dsDNA strands. These antibodies are found commonly in the sera of people with SLE.]]
[[Anti-dsDNA antibodies|Anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies]] are highly associated with SLE. They are a very [[sensitivity and specificity|specific]] marker for the disease, with some studies quoting nearly 100%.<ref name ="pmid10629135"/> Data on [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] ranges from 25–85%. Anti-dsDNA antibody levels, known as titres, correlate with disease activity in SLE; high levels indicate more active lupus. The presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies is also linked with [[lupus nephritis]] and there is evidence they are the cause. Some anti-dsDNA antibodies are cross reactive with other antigens found on the [[glomerular basement membrane]] (GBM) of the kidney, such as [[heparan sulphate]], [[collagen]] IV, [[fibronectin]] and [[laminin]]. Binding to these antigens within the kidney could cause [[inflammation]] and [[complement fixation]], resulting in kidney damage. It is also possible that the anti-dsDNA antibodies are internalised by cells when they bind membrane antigens and then are displayed on the cell surface. This could promote inflammatory responses by T-cells within the kidney. It is important to note that not all anti-dsDNA antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis and that other factors can cause this symptom in their absence. The antigen of anti-dsDNA antibodies is [[dsDNA|double stranded DNA]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mok|first=CC|coauthors=Lau, CS|title=Pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus.|journal=Journal of clinical pathology|date=2003 Jul|volume=56|issue=7|pages=481–90|pmid=12835292}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Yung|first=S|coauthors=Chan, TM|title=Anti-DNA antibodies in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis—the emerging mechanisms.|journal=Autoimmunity reviews|date=2008 Feb|volume=7|issue=4|pages=317–21|pmid=18295737}}</ref>

===Anti-histone antibodies===
[[Anti-histone antibodies]] are found in the serum of up to 75–95% of people with [[drug-induced lupus erythematosus|drug induced lupus]] and 75% of idiopathic SLE. Unlike anti-dsDNA antibodies in SLE, these antibodies do not fix complement. Although they are most commonly found in drug induced lupus, they are also found in some cases of SLE, [[scleroderma]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and undifferentiated connective tissue disease. Many drugs are known to cause drug induced lupus and they produce various antigenic targets within the nucleosome that are often cross reactive with several histone proteins and DNA. [[Procainamide]] causes a form of drug-induced lupus that produces antibodies to the histone H2A and H2B complex.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vasoo|first=S|title=Drug-induced lupus: an update.|journal=Lupus|year=2006|volume=15|issue=11|pages=757–61|pmid=17153847}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=U|coauthors=Zandman-Goddard, G|title=Drug-induced lupus: an update.|journal=Autoimmunity reviews|date=2010 Nov|volume=10|issue=1|pages=46–50|pmid=20656071}}</ref>

===Anti-gp210 and anti-p62===
Both [[anti-glycoprotein-210 antibodies|anti-glycoprotein-210]] (anti-gp210) and [[anti-p62 antibodies|anti-nucleoporin 62]] (anti-p62) antibodies are antibodies to components of the nuclear membrane and are found in [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] (PBC). Each antibody is present in approximately 25–30% of PBC. The antigens of both antibodies are constituents of the [[nuclear membrane]]. gp210 is a 200kDa protein involved in anchoring components of the [[nuclear pore]] to the nuclear membrane. The p62 antigen is a 60kDa nuclear pore complex.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=T|coauthors=Guan, T; Gerace, L|title=Molecular and functional characterization of the p62 complex, an assembly of nuclear pore complex glycoproteins.|journal=The Journal of cell biology|date=1996 Aug|volume=134|issue=3|pages=589–601|pmid=8707840}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Mackay|first=IR|coauthors=Whittingham, S; Fida, S; Myers, M; Ikuno, N; Gershwin, ME; Rowley, MJ|title=The peculiar autoimmunity of primary biliary cirrhosis.|journal=Immunological reviews|date=2000 Apr|volume=174|pages=226–37|pmid=10807519}}</ref>

===Anti-centromere antibodies===
[[File:CENTROMERE.jpg|thumb|[[Immunofluorescence]] staining pattern of anti-centromere antibodies on HEp-20-10 cells.]]

CENP-A is a 17kDa [[histone H3]]-like protein. CENP-B is an 80kDa DNA binding protein involved in the folding of [[heterochromatin]]. CENP-C is a 140kDa protein involved in [[kinetochore]] assembly. CENP-D is a 50kDa protein of unknown function, but may be [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to another protein involved in [[chromatin condensation]], [[RCC1]]. CENP-E is a 312kDa protein from the [[kinesin]] motor protein family. CENP-F is a 367kDa protein from the nuclear matrix that associates with the kinetochore in late [[G2 phase]] during mitosis. CENP-A, B and C antibodies are most commonly found (16–42% of systemic sclerosis) and are associated with Raynaud's phenomenon, [[telangiectasia]]s, lung involvement and early onset in systemic sclerosis.<ref name="pmid12718748"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Rattner|first=JB|coauthors=Mack, GJ; Fritzler, MJ|title=Autoantibodies to components of the mitotic apparatus.|journal=Molecular biology reports|date=1998 Jul|volume=25|issue=3|pages=143–55|pmid=9700050}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Renz|first=Harald|title=Autoimmune diagnostics|publisher=De Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-11-022864-9}}</ref>

===Anti-sp100===
[[sp100 nuclear antigen|Anti-sp100 antibodies]] are found in approximately 20–30% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] (PBC). They are found in few individuals without PBC, and therefore are a very specific marker of the disease. The sp100 antigen is found within nuclear bodies; large protein complexes in the nucleus that may have a role in cell growth and differentiation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Worman|first=HJ|coauthors=Courvalin, JC|title=Antinuclear antibodies specific for primary biliary cirrhosis.|journal=Autoimmunity reviews|date=2003 Jun|volume=2|issue=4|pages=211–7|pmid=12848948}}</ref>

===Anti-PM-Scl===
Anti-PM-Scl antibodies are found in up to 50% of [[PM/Scl overlap syndrome|polymyositis/systemic scleorosis (PM/SSc) overlap syndrome]]. Around 80% of individuals with antibodies present in their blood serum will have the disorder. The presence of the antibodies is linked to limited cutaneous involvement of PM/SSc overlap syndrome. The antigenic targets of the antibodies are components of the [[RNA]]-processing [[exosome complex]] in the [[nucleolus]].<ref name="pmid12718748"/> There are ten proteins in this complex and antibodies to eight of them are found at varying frequencies; PM/Scl-100 (70–80%), PM/Scl-75 (46–80%), hRrp4 (50%), hRrp42 (21%), hRrp46 (18%), hCs14 (14%), hRrp41 (10%) and hRrp40 (7%).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mahler|first=M|coauthors=Raijmakers, R|title=Novel aspects of autoantibodies to the PM/Scl complex: clinical, genetic and diagnostic insights.|journal=Autoimmunity reviews|date=2007 Aug|volume=6|issue=7|pages=432–7|pmid=17643929}}</ref>

The presence of ANAs in blood can be confirmed by a screening test. Although there are many tests for the detection of ANAs, the most common tests used for screening are indirect immunofluoresence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).<ref name="pmid22133120">{{cite journal |author=Granito A, Muratori P, Quarneti C, Pappas G, Cicola R, Muratori L |title=Antinuclear antibodies as ancillary markers in primary biliary cirrhosis|journal=Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=65–74 |year=2012 |month=January|pmid=22133120 |doi=10.1586/erm.11.82 |url=}}</ref> Following detection of ANAs, various subtypes are determined.<ref name ="pmid10629135"/>

===Indirect immunofluorescence===
Indirect [[immunofluorescence]] is one of the most commonly used tests for ANAs. Typically, HEp-2 cells are used as a substrate to detect the antibodies in human serum. Microscope slides are coated with HEp-2 cells and the serum is incubated with the cells. If antibodies are present then they will bind to the [[antigen]]s on the cells; in the case of ANAs, the antibodies will bind to the nucleus. These can be visualised by adding a fluorescent tagged (usually [[Fluorescein isothiocyanate|FITC]] or rhodopsin B) anti-human antibody that binds to the antibodies. The molecule will fluoresce when a specific wavelength of light shines on it, which can be seen under the microscope. Depending on the antibody present in the human serum and the localisation of the antigen in the cell, distinct patterns of fluorescence will be seen on the HEp-2 cells.<ref>{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Wulf B.

====HEp-2====
[[File:ANA NUCLEOLAR 3.jpg|thumb|left|Nucleolar staining pattern of ANAs.]] Until around 1975, when HEp-2 cells were introduced, animal tissue was used as the standard substrate for immunofluorescence.<ref name="pmid19121207"/> HEp-2 cells are currently one of the most common substrates for ANA detection by immunofluorescence. They are superior to the previously used animal tissues because of their large size and the high rate of [[mitosis]] (cell division) in the [[cell line]]. This allows the detection of antibodies to mitosis-specific antigens, such as centromere antibodies. They also allow identification of anti-Ro antibodies, because [[acetone]] is used for [[fixation (histology)|fixation]] of the cells (other fixatives can wash the antigen away).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keren|first=DF|title=Antinuclear antibody testing.|journal=Clinics in laboratory medicine|date=2002 Jun|volume=22|issue=2|pages=447–74|pmid=12134471}}</ref>

There are many nuclear staining patterns seen on HEp-2 cells; homogeneous, speckled, nucleolar, nuclear membranous, centromeric, nuclear dot and pleiomorphic. The homogeneous pattern is seen when the condensed [[chromosomes]] and interphase [[chromatin]] stain. This pattern is associated with anti-dsDNA antibodies, antibodies to nucleosomal components and anti-histone antibodies. There are two speckled patterns; fine and coarse. The fine speckled pattern has fine nuclear staining with unstained [[metaphase]] chromatin, which is associated with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. The coarse staining pattern has coarse granular nuclear staining, caused by anti-U1-RNP and anti-Sm antibodies. The nucleolar staining pattern is associated with many antibodies including anti-Scl-70, anti-PM-Scl, anti-fibrillarin and anti-Th/To. Nuclear membrane staining appears as a fluorescent ring around the cell nucleus and are produced by anti-gp210 and anti-p62 antibodies. The centromere pattern shows multiple [[nuclear dots]] in interphase and mitotic cells, corresponding to the number of chromosomes in the cell. Nuclear dot patterns show between 13–25 nuclear dots in [[interphase]] cells and are produced by anti-[[sp100 nuclear antigen|sp100]] antibodies. Pleiomorphic pattern is caused by antibodies to the [[proliferating cell nuclear antigen]].<ref name="pmid7604300"/><ref name ="pmid11863229"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Nesher|first=G|coauthors=Margalit, R; Ashkenazi, YJ|title=Anti-nuclear envelope antibodies: Clinical associations.|journal=Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism|date=2001 Apr|volume=30|issue=5|pages=313–20|pmid=11303304}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sack|first=U|coauthors=Conrad, K; Csernok, E; Frank, I; Hiepe, F; Krieger, T; Kromminga, A; Landenberg, Pv; Messer, G; Witte, T; Mierau, R; die deutsche EASI-Gruppe (European Autoimmunity Standardization, Initiative)|title=Autoantibody detection by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells.|journal=Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)|date=2009 Jun|volume=134|issue=24|pages=1278–82|pmid=19499499}}</ref>

====''Crithidia luciliae''====
[[File:CRITHIDIA 2.jpg|thumb|Immunofluorescence staining pattern of anti-dsDNA antibodies on ''C. luciliae''substrate. The kinetoplast located near the flagellum is stained, indicating the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies in a person with systemic lupus erythamatosus.]]
''[[Crithidia luciliae]]'' are [[flagellate|haemoflaggelate]] [[single celled organism|single celled]] [[protist]]s. They are used as a substrate in immunofluorescence for the detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies. They possess an [[organelle]] known as the [[kinetoplast]] which is a large [[mitochondrion]] with a network of interlocking circular dsDNA molecules. After incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies and fluorescent-labelled anti-human antibodies, the kinetoplast will fluoresce. The lack of other nuclear antigens in this organelle means that using ''C.luciliae'' as a substrate allows for the specific detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies.<ref name ="pmid10629135"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Slater|first=NG|coauthors=Cameron, JS; Lessof, MH|title=The Crithidia luciliae kinetoplast immunofluorescence test in systemic lupus erythematosus.|journal=Clinical and experimental immunology|date=1976 Sep|volume=25|issue=3|pages=480–6|pmid=786521}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=TA|coauthors=Englund, PT|title=The structure and replication of kinetoplast DNA.|journal=Annual review of microbiology|year=1995|volume=49|pages=117–43|pmid=8561456}}</ref>

===ELISA===
[[Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA) uses antigen-coated [[microtitre plate]]s for the detection of ANAs. Each well of a microtitre plate is coated with either a single antigen or multiple antigens to detect specific antibodies or to screen for ANAs, respectively. The antigens are either from cell extracts or recombinant. Blood serum is incubated in the wells of the plate and is washed out. If antibodies that bind to antigen are present then they will remain after washing. A secondary anti-human antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as [[horseradish peroxidase]]. The enzyme reaction will produce a change in colour of the solution that is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to the antigen.<ref name="pmid19121207"/><ref name="pmid16126186"/><ref name="isbn0-412-05601-1">{{cite book |author=Deshpande, S.

==History==
[[File:LECell.jpg|thumb|LE cell]]
The [[LE cell]] was discovered in [[bone marrow]] in 1948 by Hargraves ''et al.''<ref>Hargraves M, Richmond H, Morton R. ''Presentation of two bone marrow components, the tart cell and the LE cell.'' Mayo Clin Proc 1948;27:25–28.</ref> This was the first indication that processes affecting the cell nucleus were responsible for SLE. In 1959 it was discovered that serum from individuals with SLE contained antibodies that precipitated with saline extracts of nuclei, known as [[extractable nuclear antigens]] (ENAs). This led to the characterisation of ENA antigens and their respective antibodies.  Thus, anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies were discovered in 1966 and 1971, respectively. In the 1970s, the anti-Ro/anti-SS-A and anti-La/anti-SS-B antibodies were discovered. The Scl-70 antibody was known to be a specific antibody to scleroderma in 1979, however the antigen (topoisomerase-I) was not characterised until 1986. The Jo-1 antigen and antibody were characterised in 1980.<ref name ="pmid10629135"/><ref name ="pmid15158743"/>
