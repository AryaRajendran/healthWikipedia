In [[medicine]], the '''hygiene [[hypothesis]]''' states that a lack of early childhood exposure to infectious agents, [[symbiotic]] microorganisms (e.g., [[gut flora]] or [[probiotic]]s), and parasites increases susceptibility to [[allergy|allergic]] diseases by suppressing natural development of the [[immune system]]. It is hypothesized that the [[Th1_cell#Recognition_.28Signal_1.29|T<sub>H</sub>1]] polarized response is not induced early in life leaving the body more susceptible to developing T<sub>H</sub>2 induced disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Strachan DP |title=Family size, infection and atopy: the first decade of the "hygiene hypothesis" |journal=Thorax |volume=Suppl 1 |issue= 90001|pages=S2–10 |series=55 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10943631 |pmc=1765943 |url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10943631 |doi=10.1136/thorax.55.suppl_1.S2}}</ref> The rise of [[autoimmune disease]]s and [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] in young people in the developed world has also been linked to the hygiene hypothesis.<ref>Evidence that childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with an infectious agent linked to hygiene conditions.

==History==
Although the idea that exposure to certain infections may decrease the risk of an allergy is not new, David P. Strachan was one of the first people to formally suggest the theory in an article published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' (now the ''BMJ''), in 1989.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Strachan DP |title=Hay fever, hygiene, and household size |journal=BMJ |volume=299 |issue=6710 |pages=1259–60 |year=1989 |month=November |pmid=2513902 |pmc=1838109 |doi=10.1136/bmj.299.6710.1259 }}</ref> In this article, the hygiene hypothesis was proposed to explain the observation that [[hay fever]] and [[eczema]], both allergic diseases, were less common in children from larger families, which were presumably exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings, than in children from families with only one child.

The hygiene hypothesis has been extensively investigated by [[immunology|immunologists]] and [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] and has become an important theoretical framework for the study of allergic disorders. It is used to explain the increase in allergic diseases that has been seen since industrialization, and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries. The hygiene hypothesis has now expanded to include exposure to [[symbiotic]] bacteria and parasites as important modulators of immune system development, along with infectious agents.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Grammatikos | first1 = AP | title = The genetic and environmental basis of atopic diseases. | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18608118 | journal = Annals of medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 7 | pages = 482–95 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18608118 | doi = 10.1080/07853890802082096 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Allergic diseases are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to harmless [[antigens]] driven by a [[t helper cell|T<sub>H</sub>2]]-mediated immune response.  Many [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es elicit a [[t helper cell|T<sub>H</sub>1]]-mediated immune response, which down-regulates T<sub>H</sub>2 responses. The first proposed mechanism of action of the hygiene hypothesis stated that insufficient stimulation of the T<sub>H</sub>1 arm, stimulating the cell defence of the immune system, leads to an overactive T<sub>H</sub>2 arm, stimulating the antibody-mediated immunity of the immune systems, which in turn led to allergic disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Folkerts G, Walzl G, Openshaw PJ |title=Do common childhood infections 'teach' the immune system not to be allergic? |journal=Immunol Today |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=118–20 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10777250 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167569900015826 |doi=10.1016/S0167-5699(00)01582-6}}</ref>

The first proposed mechanistic explanation for the hygiene hypothesis cannot explain the rise in incidence (similar to the rise of allergic diseases) of several T<sub>H</sub>1-mediated [[autoimmunity|autoimmune diseases]], including [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (IBD), [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS), and [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type I diabetes]].  The major proposed alternative mechanistic explanation is that the developing immune system must receive stimuli (from infectious agents, symbiotic bacteria, or parasites) in order to adequately develop [[regulatory T cell]]s, or it will be more susceptible to autoimmune diseases and allergic diseases, because of insufficiently repressed T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 responses, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bufford JD, Gern JE |title=The hygiene hypothesis revisited |journal=Immunol Allergy Clin North Am |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=247–62, v–vi |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15878454 |doi=10.1016/j.iac.2005.03.005 }}</ref>

==Breadth of the hypothesis==
The hygiene hypothesis has expanded from eczema and hay fever to include exposure to several varieties of microorganisms and parasites, with which humans coexisted throughout much of our evolutionary history, as necessary for balanced and regulated immune system development.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gold DR,Wright R |title=Population disparities in asthma |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=89–113 |year=2005 |pmid=15760282 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.26.021304.144528 |last2=Wright |first2=R}}</ref>  In recent times, the development of hygienic practices, elimination of childhood diseases, widespread use of antibiotics, and relative availability of effective medical care have diminished or eliminated exposure to these microorganisms and parasites during development.  Examples of organisms that may be important for proper development of T regulatory cells include [[lactobacillus|lactobacilli]], various [[mycobacterium|mycobacteria]], and certain [[Parasitic worm|helminths]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rook GA,Brunet LR |title=Old friends for breakfast |journal=Clin Exp Allergy |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=841–2 |year=2005 |pmid=16008666 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2222.2005.02112.x |last2=Brunet |first2=LR}}</ref>

==Supporting evidence==
The hygiene hypothesis is supported by epidemiological data, but there is currently no plausible explanation for the inverse relationship between infections and certain diseases. Studies have shown that various immunological and autoimmune diseases are much less common in the developing world than the industrialized world and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world.<ref name="pmid12910582">{{cite journal |author=Gibson PG, Henry RL, Shah S, Powell H, Wang H |title=Migration to a western country increases asthma symptoms but not eosinophilic airway inflammation |journal=[[Pediatr.

Studies in mice have shown that exposure of young mice to viruses can result in a decreased incidence of [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type I diabetes]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oldstone MB |title=Prevention of type I diabetes in non obese diabetic mice by virus infection |journal=Science |volume=239 |issue=4839 |pages=500–2 |year=1988 |month=January |pmid=3277269 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3277269 |doi=10.1126/science.3277269}}</ref>

They showed that in a state of too few long lived T-cells, because of lack of infections, not enough short lived T-cells could be produced by long lived T-cells during homeostatic expansion. Therefore, more auto reactive T-cells will divide in such a state, causing multiplying auto reactive T-cells with a greater risk of causing autoimmune diseases like [[type I diabetes]] or [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=King C, Ilic A, Koelsch K, Sarvetnick N |title=Homeostatic expansion of T cells during immune insufficiency generates autoimmunity |journal=Cell |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=265–77 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15084263 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867404003356 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00335-6}}</ref>

One conclusion is that a clean environment, with lack of infections (like early life infections) increases the risk of an autoimmune disorder.

T<sub>H</sub>2 immune disorders such as [[asthma]] and other [[allergy|allergic diseases]] are probably related to the hygiene hypothesis {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}. A baby has many T<sub>H</sub>2 cells, which stimulate the production of antibodies. When not sufficiently stimulated with early life diseases, the immune system will have too many T<sub>H</sub>2 cells present, leading to a greater risk of T<sub>H</sub>2 immune disorder. If a child is exposed to infection diseases then the cell defense will be stimulated via T<sub>H</sub>1 cells causing a reduction of T<sub>H</sub>2 cells and subsequently a reduction of antibody stimulation by T<sub>H</sub>2 and therefore a lower risk of developing an allergic disease such as [[asthma]]. Unfortunately, [[vaccines|vaccination]] only uses the T<sub>H</sub>2 mechanism. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In developed countries where childhood diseases were eliminated, the asthma rate for youth is approximately 10%. In the 19th century, asthma was a very rare disease. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Several pieces of experimental evidence also support the hygiene hypothesis.

==Helminthic therapy==
{{Main|Helminthic therapy}}
{{See also|Effects of parasitic worms on the immune system}}
The use of [[parasitic worms]] (also known as helminths) to treat the types of disease described by the hygiene hypothesis is being studied in the UK, USA and Australia.

Because of the promise shown by this research, two versions of [[Helminthic therapy]], using ''[[Trichuris suis]]'' ova or ''[[Necator americanus]]'' larvae, have become available.

Helminthic therapy is the treatment of [[autoimmune disease]]s and [[immune disorder]]s by means of deliberate infestation with a [[helminth]] or with the ova of a helminth. Helminthic therapy is currently being studied as a promising treatment for several (non-viral) [[autoimmune disease]]s including [[Crohn's disease]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hunter MM, McKay DM |title=Review article: helminths as therapeutic agents for inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Aliment.

In addition to the treatment of immune disorders the anti-inflammatory effects of helminth infection are prompting interest and research into diseases that involve inflammation but that are not currently considered to include autoimmunity or immune dysregulation as a causative factor. Heart disease and arteriosclerosis both have similar epidemiological profiles as autoimmune diseases and both involve inflammation. Nor can their increase be solely attributed to environmental factors. Recent research has focused on the eradication of helminths to explain this discrepancy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Magen E, Borkow G, Bentwich Z, Mishal J, Scharf S |title=Can worms defend our hearts?

==Alternative hypotheses==
{{SectOR|date=May 2012}}
There are many other hypotheses which aim to explain the increase in [[Allergy|allergies]] in developed nations, many of which are also related to the other. A few other major areas of focus in the literature include infant feeding, over-exposure to certain allergens and exposure to certain pollutants.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Infant feeding covers a range of topics which include whether babies are breast fed or not and for how long, when they are introduced to solid foods and the type of these foods, whether they are given cow's milk and even the types of processing that the milk undergoes. Numerous articles{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} have reported that over-exposure to certain allergens in occupational situations can cause allergic diseases, such as [[Laboratory animal allergy]], [[Bird fancier's lung|bird lung]], [[farmer's lung]], and bakers lung (See [[Wheat allergy]]). The third of these theories suggests that pollution (such as [[diesel exhaust]]) might be responsible for the increase of these diseases; however, some also claim that developed nations have also been becoming cleaner, and much more so than in the bleak [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] years of the early [[industrial revolution]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

For immunological conditions related to Strachan's original version of the hygiene hypothesis, such as [[atopy]] and [[asthma]], the [[pool chlorine hypothesis]] was proposed by Albert Bernard and his colleagues as an alternative hypothesis based on [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] evidence in 2003.<ref>{{cite journal
