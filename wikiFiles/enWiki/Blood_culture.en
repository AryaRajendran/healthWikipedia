'''Blood culture''' is a [[microbiological culture]] of [[blood]]. It is employed to detect [[infections]] that are spreading through the bloodstream (such as [[bacteremia]], [[septicemia]] amongst others). This is possible because the bloodstream is usually a sterile environment.

==History==
Blood cultures were pioneered in the early 20th century.

==Purposes==
When a patient shows signs or symptoms of a systemic infection, results from a blood culture can verify that an infection is present, and they can identify the type (or types) of microorganism that is responsible for the infection.  For example, blood tests can identify the causative organisms in severe [[pneumonia]], [[puerperal fever]], [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], neonatal [[epiglottitis]], [[sepsis]], and [[fever of unknown origin]] (FUO). However, negative growths do not exclude infection.

==Risks==
The usual risks of venipuncture and the occurrence of false positive results (3+%) leading to inappropriate treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Madeo M, Davies D, Owen L, Wadsworth P, Johnson G, Martin C |title=Reduction in the contamination rate of blood cultures collected by medical staff in the accident and emergency department |journal=Clinical effectiveness in Nursing |volume=7 |pages=30–32 |year=2003 }}</ref>

==Method==
A minimum of 10 ml of blood is taken through [[venipuncture]] and injected into two or more  "blood bottles" with specific [[Growth medium|media]]  for [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[anaerobic organism]]s. A common media used for anaerobes is [[thioglycollate broth]].

The blood is collected using aseptic technique.  This requires that both the tops of the culture bottles and the venipuncture site of the patient are cleaned prior to collection with swabs 70% [[isopropyl alcohol]].<ref>{{cite journal

To  maximise the diagnostic yield of blood cultures multiple sets of  cultures (each set consisting of aerobic & anaerobic vials filled  with 3–10  mL) may be ordered by medical staff. A common protocol used in US  hospitals includes the following:

* Set 1 = L. antecubital fossa at 0 minutes
* Set 2 = R. antecubital  fossa at 30 minutes
* Set 3 = L. or R. antecubital fossa at 90 minutes

Ordering multiple sets of cultures increases the  probability of discovering a pathogenic organism in the blood and  reduces the probability of having a positive culture due to skin  contaminants.

After inoculating the culture vials, advisably with new needles and not the ones used for venepuncture, they are sent to the clinical pathology microbiology department.  Here the bottles are entered into a blood culture machine, which  incubate the specimens at body temperature. The blood culture instrument  reports positive blood cultures (cultures with bacteria present, thus  indicating the patient is "[[bacteremic]]"). Most cultures  are monitored for 5 days after which negative vials are removed.

If  a vial is positive, a microbiologist will perform a Gram Stain on the  blood for a rapid, general ID of the bacteria, which they will report to  the attending physician of the bacteremic patient. The blood is also  subcultured or "subbed" onto agar plates to isolate the pathogenic  organism for culture and suceptibility testing, which takes up to 3  days. This culture & sensitivity (C&S) process identifies the  species of bacteria. Antibiotic sensitivities are then assessed on the  bacterial isolate to inform clinicians on appropriate antibiotics for  treatment.
