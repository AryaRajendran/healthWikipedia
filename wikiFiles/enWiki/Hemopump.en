'''Hemopump''' is an [[impeller]] like [[pump]] used in patients who have [[cardiogenic shock]], need high-risk [[angioplasty]], or develop postcardiotomy pump failure.The Hemopump system is simple, inexpensive, and well tolerated by the blood elements. Its design allows flexibility in supporting patients during [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] and high risk angioplasty, as well as in rescuing patients with low cardiac output.

The idea of the '''hemopump''' was conceived by Dr Richard Wampler in 1975 while he worked as a public health consultant in [[Egypt]]. It was designed around 1982 while Dr Wampler worked with Nimbus Corporation in Rancho Cordova, [[California]]. As a temporary cardiac assist system, it is intended to assume up to 80% of the workload of the resting heart for at least 7 days, thus giving the heart in cardiogenic shock the opportunity to rest and recover.

==Hemopump system components==
THE CONSOLE

The power is derived from [[Alternating current|AC]] lines with [[battery backup]] for portable use.This is incorporated into a console. The console is attached to patient's bed or can be carried in hand. It also contains controls and alarms required to operate the pump.

THE PUMP

The pump is made up of [[stainless steel]]. An [[Archimedes screw]] rapidly turning (25,000 [[RPM]]) pumps the blood. The pump is attached to a [[silicone]] inflow [[cannula]]. It is threaded to the [[aorta]] through an [[artery]] in the groin ([[Femoral artery]] or Descending Aorta) and placed into the aorta just above the [[aortic valve]] and the cannula will be across the valve into the left [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]].
