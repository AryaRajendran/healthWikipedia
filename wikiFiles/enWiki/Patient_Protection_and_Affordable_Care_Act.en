The PPACA is aimed at increasing [[health insurance coverage in the United States|the rate of health insurance coverage for Americans]] and reducing the overall costs of health care.

The PPACA includes numerous provisions to take effect over several years [[#Provisions|beginning in 2010]]. There is a [[grandfather clause]] on policies issued before then that exempt them from many of these provisions, but other provisions may affect existing policies.
* [[Guaranteed issue]] will require policies to be issued regardless of any medical condition, and partial [[community rating]] will require insurers to offer the same premium to all applicants of the same age and geographical location without regard to gender or most [[pre-existing condition]]s (excluding [[tobacco]] use).<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.bcbsm.com/healthreform/pubs/ppaca_insurance_reform_2014.pdf |title=2014 Insurance Reforms under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) |publisher=Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Pool |first=Gentrie |url=http://www.asjonline.com/Exclusives/2010/10/Pages/After-PPACA-The-Future-of-the-Health-Insurance-Underwriter.aspx |title=After PPACA: The Future of the Health Insurance Underwriter &#124; LifeHealthPro |publisher=Asjonline.com |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Selected Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA) implementation dates of interest to RNs as caregivers, RNs as patients, and RNs as employees |url=http://www.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/Policy-Advocacy/HealthSystemReform/Health-Care-Reform-Legislation-Timeline.pdf |publisher=Nursingworld.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref>
* A shared responsibility requirement, commonly called an [[Health insurance mandate|individual mandate]],<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.perkinsaccounting.com/our-story/litigation-support-accounting-firm-newsroom/perkins-news-bulletin/health-insurance-legislation/health-insurance-legislation-mandates.html |title=Perkins Accounting Firm Newsroom Bulletin Health Insurance Legislation Mandates |publisher=Perkinsaccounting.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Keely |first=Cheryl |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/community/emergingissues/blogs/spotlightonhealthcarereform/archive/2010/12/13/federal-judge-rejects-commerce-clause-argument-finds-ppaca-health-insurance-individual-mandate-is-unconstitutional.aspx |title=Federal Judge Rejects Commerce Clause Argument, Finds PPACA Health Insurance Individual Mandate is Unconstitutional |publisher=Lexisnexis.com |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref> requires that all individuals not covered by an [[Employer-sponsored health insurance|employer sponsored health plan]], [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or other public insurance programs, secure an approved private-insurance policy or pay a penalty, unless the applicable individual is a member of a recognized religious sect exempted by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], or waived in cases of financial hardship.<ref name="ksr_hlth" />
* [[Health insurance exchange]]s will commence operation in each state, offering a marketplace where individuals and small businesses can compare policies and premiums, and buy insurance (with a government subsidy if eligible).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/exchanges/index.html |title=Affordable Insurance Exchanges |publisher=HealthCare.gov |date=August 18, 2011|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref>

* The text of the law expands Medicaid eligibility to include all individuals and families with incomes up to 133% of [[Federal poverty level|the poverty level]], effectively 138%, and simplifies the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|CHIP]] enrollment process. In ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'', the Supreme Court effectively allowed states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion, and some states have stated their intention to do so. States that choose to reject the Medicaid expansion can set their own Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which in many states are significantly below 133% of the poverty line; in addition, many states do not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on insurance plans purchased through exchanges are not available to those below 100% of the poverty line, this may create a coverage gap in those states.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/05/what-happens-if-a-state-opts-out-of-medicaid-in-one-chart/ |title=What Happens if a State Opts Out of Medicaid, in One Chart |author=Kliff, Sarah |date=July 5, 2012 |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=July 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcarereformmagazine.com/article/health-reform-and-medicaid-expansion.html |title=Health Reform and Medicaid Expansion|publisher=HealthCare Reform Magazine|date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familiesusa.org/assets/pdfs/health-reform/Enrollment-Policy-Provisions.pdf|title=Enrollment Policy Provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act |publisher=Families USA |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref>

===Funding===
The PPACA's provisions are funded by a variety of taxes and offsets. Major sources of new revenue include a much-broadened [[Taxation in the United States#Medicare tax|Medicare tax]] on incomes over $200,000 and $250,000, for individual and joint filers respectively, an annual fee on insurance providers, and a 40% [[excise tax]] on [[Cadillac insurance plan|"Cadillac" insurance policies]]. The income levels are not adjusted for inflation, leaving the possibility of increased taxes on incomes over 250,000 inflation-adjusted dollars after more than two decades without indexing through.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703932904574511794170939688.html The Return of the Inflation Tax], ''Wall Street Journal'' November 6, 2009.</ref> There are also taxes on pharmaceuticals, high-cost diagnostic equipment, and a 10% federal [[sales tax]] on [[tanning bed|indoor tanning services]]. Offsets are from intended cost savings such as changes in the [[Medicare Advantage]] program relative to traditional Medicare.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0321/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-will-pay-for-reform |title=Health care reform bill 101: Who Will Pay for Reform? |author=Grier, Peter |date=March 21, 2010 |publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}</ref>

Summary of tax increases: (ten-year projection)
* Increase Medicare tax rate by .9% and impose added tax of 3.8% on unearned income for high-income taxpayers: $210.2&nbsp;billion

===Effective at enactment===

* The [[Food and Drug Administration]] is now authorized to approve generic versions of [[biologic medical product|biologic]] drugs and grant biologics manufacturers 12&nbsp;years of exclusive use before generics can be developed.<ref name='ksr_list1'>{{cite web|url=http://www.kff.org/healthreform/8060.cfm|title=Health Reform Implementation Timeline|accessdate=2010-03-30|publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation}}</ref>
* The Medicaid drug [[Rebate (marketing)|rebate]] (paid by drug manufacturers to the states) for brand name drugs is increased to 23.1% (except the rebate for clotting factors and drugs approved exclusively for pediatric use increases to 17.1%), and the rebate is extended to Medicaid managed care plans; the Medicaid rebate for non-innovator, multiple source drugs is increased to 13% of average manufacturer price.<ref name='ksr_list1' />
* A non-profit [[Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute]] is established, independent from government, to undertake [[comparative effectiveness research]].<ref name='ksr_list1' /> This is charged with examining the "relative health outcomes, clinical effectiveness, and appropriateness" of different medical treatments by evaluating existing studies and conducting its own. Its 19-member board is to include patients, doctors, hospitals, drug makers, device manufacturers, insurers, payers, government officials and health experts. It will not have the power to mandate or even endorse coverage rules or reimbursement for any particular treatment. Medicare may take the Institute's research into account when deciding what procedures it will cover, so long as the new research is not the sole justification and the agency allows for public input.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/36135106/ns/health-health_care/ |title=True or false?

The regulations that implement this provision are in subpart I of 42 CFR part 412 (§412.150 through §412.154).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program.html|title=Readmissions Reduction Program}}</ref> Starting in October, an estimated total of 2,217 hospitals across the nation will be penalized; however, only 307 of these hospitals will receive this year's maximum penalty, i.e., 1 percent off their base Medicare reimbursements. The penalty will be deducted from reimbursements each time a hospital submits a claim starting Oct. 1. The maximum penalty will increase after this year, to 2 percent of regular payments starting in October 2013 and then to 3 percent the following year. As an example, if a hospital received the maximum penalty of 1 percent and it submitted a claim for $20,000 for a stay, Medicare would reimburse it $19,800. Together, these 2,217 hospitals will forfeit more than $280 million in Medicare funds over the next year, i.e., until October 2013, as Medicare and Medicaid begin a wide-ranging push to start paying health care providers based on the quality of care they provide. The $280 million in penalties comprises about 0.3 percent of the total amount hospitals are paid by Medicare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2012/August/13/medicare-hospitals-readmissions-penalties.aspx|title=Medicare To Penalize 2,217 Hospitals For Excess Readmissions}}</ref>

* Section 2708 to the Public Health Service Act becomes effective, which prohibits patient eligibility waiting periods in excess of 90 days for group health plan coverage.

===Background===
{{Main|Health care reform in the United States|Health care reform debate in the United States|Health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration}}

Health care reform was a major topic of discussion during the [[2008 Democratic presidential primaries]]. As the race narrowed, attention focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, [[New York]] Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] and the eventual nominee, [[Illinois]] Senator Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45&nbsp;million Americans estimated to be without health insurance at some point during each year. One point of difference between the plans was that Clinton's plan was to require all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual [[health insurance mandate]]), while Obama's was to provide a [[subsidy]] but not create a direct requirement. During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|general election]] campaign between Obama and the Republican nominee, [[Arizona]] Senator [[John McCain]], Obama said that fixing health care would be one of his four priorities if he won the presidency.<ref name="Sep2008FirstPresidentialDebate">{{Cite news | url = http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/debates/transcripts/first-presidential-debate.html | title = The First Presidential Debate | date = September 26, 2008 | work = The New York Times }}</ref>

During the August 2009 summer congressional recess, many members went back to their districts and entertained town hall meetings to solicit public opinion on the proposals. Over the recess, the [[Tea Party movement]] organized protests and many [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] groups and individuals targeted congressional town hall meetings to voice their opposition to the proposed reform bills.<ref name="reuterstimeline"/> 

To maintain the progress of the legislative process, when Congress returned from recess, in September 2009 President Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress supporting the ongoing Congressional negotiations, to re-emphasize his commitment to reform and again outline his proposals.<ref name="Sep2009JointAddress">{{cite web

The reform proposals that ultimately became the Senate bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, bore similarities to prior healthcare reform proposals introduced by Republicans. The bill's drafters had deliberately drawn on bipartisan ideas to increase the chances of getting the necessary votes for passage. In particular, the idea of an individual mandate coupled with subsidies for private insurance, as an alternative to public insurance, was considered a way to get Universal Health Insurance that could win the support of the Senate. Many healthcare policy experts have pointed out that the "individual mandate" requirement to buy health insurance was contained in many previous Republican/conservative proposals for healthcare legislation, going back as far as 1989.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/02/07/the-tortuous-conservative-history-of-the-individual-mandate/ "The Tortuous History of Conservatives and the Individual Mandate"]</ref> Among these past proposals: In 1993 Senator [[John Chafee]] introduced the Health Equity and Access Reform Today Act which contained a "Universal Coverage" requirement with a penalty for non-compliance.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2010/February/23/GOP-1993-health-reform-bill.aspx |title=Summary Of A 1993 Republican Health Reform Plan |publisher=Kaiserhealthnews.org |date=2010-02-23 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Graphics/2010/022310-Bill-comparison.aspx |title=Chart: Comparing Health Reform Bills: Democrats and Republicans 2009, Republicans 1993 |publisher=Kaiserhealthnews.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> Advocates for the 1993 bill which contained the "individual mandate" included prominent Republicans who today oppose the mandate, namely Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Charles Grassley (R-IA), Robert Bennett (R-UT), and Christopher Bond (R-MO).<ref>[http://healthcarereform.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004182 "History of the Individual Health Insurance Mandate, 1989-2010 Republican Origins of Democratic Health Care Provision"]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/03/31/149767150/in-1993-republicans-proposed-a-mandate-first |title=In 1993 Republicans Proposed A Mandate First |publisher=NPR }}</ref> In 1994 Senator [[Don Nickles]] introduced the Consumer Choice Health Security Act which also contained an individual mandate with a penalty provision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradostatesman.com/content/991732-ag-suthers-couldn%3Ft-be-more-wrong-his-decision-file-lawsuit |title=AG Suthers couldn't be more wrong in his decision to file lawsuit |publisher=Coloradostatesman.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> However, [[Don Nickles|Nickles]] removed the mandate from the act shortly after introduction, stating that they had decided "that government should not compel people to buy health insurance."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/opinion/gop-and-health-mandate.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1333652503-360xnkv/rpzNURZGZh5Vdw | work=The New York Times | title=G.O.P. and Health Mandate | date=February 26, 2012}}</ref> 

Experts have also pointed out that the healthcare legislation that emerged from Congress in 2009 and 2010 is patterned, largely, after former Republican Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney's [[Massachusetts health care reform|state healthcare plan]] which also contains the individual mandate.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2011/06/28/romneycare_vs_obamacare/ "RomneyCare vs. ObamaCare"]</ref> In addition to having received bipartisan support in Massachusetts, the PPACA drafters believed they could win support by showing areas of success of the Massachusetts reform and building on it's ideas to achieve a national system. The same adviser, Jonathan Gruber, who had worked on reform in Massachusetts, consulted the drafters of the PPACA.

There were many threats made against members of Congress and many were assigned extra protection.<ref name=WashPost-04092010>{{cite news | title=Anger over health-care reform spurs rise in threats against Congress members |last=Horwitz|first=Sari|last2=Pershing|first2=Ben| date=April 9, 2010 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/08/AR2010040805476.html?nav=hcmodule | work =[[The Washington Post]] | accessdate = April 9, 2010 }}</ref>

With the Republican minority in the Senate vowing to filibuster any bill that they did not support, requiring a cloture vote to end debate, 60 votes would be necessary to get passage in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Cohn |url=http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/the-treatment/why-reform-survived-august |title=Why Reform Survived August |publisher=NewRepublic.com |date=2009-09-07 }}</ref> Initially, at the start of the [[111th_United_States_Congress#Party_summary|111th Congress]], Democrats had only 58 votes (the Senate seat in Minnesota that would be won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, and Arlen Specter was still a Republican). To reach 60 votes, negotiations were undertaken to satisfy the demands of moderate Democrats, and to try and bring aboard several Republican Senators (particular attention was given to Bob Bennett, Chuck Grassley, Mike Enzi, and Olympia Snowe). Negotiations continued even after July 7 - when [[Al Franken]] was sworn into the Senate and by which time [[Arlen Specter|Senator Arlen Specter]] had switched parties - because of disagreements over the bill's substance (which was still being drafted in Committee), and because moderate Democrats hoped to win bipartisan support. However, on August 25, before the bill could come up for a vote, [[Ted Kennedy]] (a staunch and long-time advocate for Health Care Reform) succumbed to his terminal brain cancer, depriving Democrats of a crucial 60th vote. Attention was drawn to [[Olympia Snowe|Senator Snowe]] as the potential replacement because of her vote in favor of the draft bill in the Finance Committee on October 15, however she explicitly warned that this did not mean she would support the final bill.<ref name="Jonathan Cohn">{{cite web|author=Jonathan Cohn |url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/75077/how-they-did-it |title=How They Did It |publisher=NewRepublic.com |date=2010-05-21 }}</ref> 

When [[Paul G. Kirk|Paul Kirk]] was appointed as Senator Kennedy's temporary replacement on September 24, regaining Democrat's 60th vote, negotiations turned to the demands of moderate Democrats to finalize their support, whose votes would be necessary to break the Republican filibuster. [[Harry Reid|Majority Leader Harry Reid]] focused on satisfying the centrist members of the Democratic caucus until the hold-outs narrowed down to Connecticut [[Joe Lieberman|Senator Joe Lieberman]] (an independent who caucused with Democrats) and Nebraska [[Ben Nelson|Senator Ben Nelson]].

After a final 13-hour negotiation, Nelson's support for the bill was won after two concessions: a compromise on abortion, modifying the language of the bill "to give states the right to prohibit coverage of abortion within their own insurance exchanges" (requiring consumers to pay for the procedure out-of-pocket, if the state decided it); and an amendment to offer a higher rate of [[Medicaid]] reimbursement for Nebraska.<ref name="reuterstimeline"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Cohn |url=http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/the-treatment/breaking-nelson-says-yes-makes-60 |title=BREAKING: Nelson Says Yes; That Makes 60 |publisher=NewRepublic.com |date=2009-12-19 }}</ref>  The latter half of the compromise was derisively referred to as the "Cornhusker Kickback"<ref>{{cite news|title='Cornhusker' Out, More Deals In: Health Care Bill Gives Special Treatment|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/03/18/cornhusker-kickback-gets-boot-health/|date=March 19, 2010|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> (and was later repealed by the subsequent reconciliation amendment bill).

With Democrats having [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|lost a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate]], but having already passed the Senate bill with 60 votes on December 23; the most viable option for the proponents of comprehensive reform was for the House to abandon its own health reform bill, the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]], and pass the Senate's bill (The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) instead. Various health policy experts encouraged the House to pass the Senate version of the bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-treatment/47-health-policy-experts-including-me-say-sign-the-senate-bill |title=Pollack-The New Republic-January 22, 2010 |publisher=Tnr.com |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> However, House Democrats were not happy with the content of the Senate bill and had expected to be able to negotiate changes in a (House-Senate) Conference before passing a final bill. With that option off the table (as any bill that emerged from Conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to be passed in the Senate over another Republican filibuster); the House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill (ultimately the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010|Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act]]), which could be passed via the [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation]] process.<ref name="nytimesjourney"/><ref name="Reconciliationprimer">{{cite web|author=Jonathan Chait |url=http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/jonathan-chait/brief-reconciliation-primer |title=A Brief Reconciliation Primer |publisher=NewRepublic.com |date=2010-02-20 }}</ref> Unlike the regular order, reconciliation is not subject to a [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] (which requires 60 votes to break), but the process is [[Byrd Rule|limited to budget changes,]] which is why it was never able to be used to pass a comprehensive reform bill (with its inherently non-budgetary regulations as in the PPACA) in the first place.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Cohn |url=http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/the-treatment/reconciliation-why-most-dems-dont-want-go-there |title=Reconciliation: Why Most Dems Don't Want to Go There |publisher=NewRepublic.com |date=2009-09-21 }}</ref> Whereas the already passed Senate bill could not have been put through reconciliation, most of House Democrats' demands were budgetary: "these changes -- higher subsidy levels, different kinds of taxes to pay for them, nixing the Nebraska Medicaid deal -- mainly involve taxes and spending.

The remaining obstacle was a pivotal group of pro-life Democrats, initially reluctant to support the bill, led by Congressman [[Bart Stupak]]. The group found the possibility of federal funding for [[abortion]] was substantive enough to cause their opposition to the bill. The Senate bill had not included language that satisfied their abortion concerns, but they could not include additional such language in the reconciliation bill, as they were obviously outside the scope of the process with its budgetary limits. Instead, President Obama issued [[Executive Order 13535]], reaffirming the principles in the [[Hyde Amendment]].

====Effects on insurance premiums====

For the effect on health insurance premiums, the CBO referred<ref name="CBO-Reid-Dec2009"/>{{Rp|15}} to its November 2009 analysis<ref name=CBOPremiumEffect>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=10781&type=1 |title=An Analysis of Health Insurance Premiums Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act |publisher=Cbo.gov |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> and stated that the effects would "probably be quite similar" to that earlier analysis. The analysis forecasts that by 2016, for the non-group market comprising 17% of the market, premiums per person would increase by 10 to 13% but that over half of these insureds would receive subsidies that would decrease the premium paid to "well below" premiums charged under current law. For the small group market, 13% of the market, premiums would be impacted 1 to −3% and −8 to −11% for those receiving subsidies; for the large group market comprising 70% of the market, premiums would be impacted 0 to −3%, with insureds under high premium plans subject to excise taxes being charged −9 to −12%. The analysis was affected by various factors, including increased benefits particularly for the nongroup markets, more healthy insureds due to the mandate, administrative efficiencies related to the health exchanges, and insureds under high-premium plans reducing benefits in response to the tax.<ref name=CBOPremiumEffect/>

The [[Associated Press]] reported that, as a result of PPACA's provisions concerning the [[Medicare Part D coverage gap]] (between the ''initial coverage limit'' and the ''catastrophic coverage threshold'' in the [[Medicare Part D]] [[prescription drug]] program), individuals falling in this "donut hole" would save about 40 percent.<ref name="shrinks">{{cite web| last = Alonso-Zaldivar | first = Ricardo| title = AP Newsbreak: Medicare's drug coverage gap shrinks| publisher = [[Businessweek]]| date = November 27, 2011| url = http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9R93OMO3.htm| accessdate = October 25, 2012}}</ref> Almost all of the savings came because, with regard to brand-name drugs, PPACA secured a discount from pharmaceutical companies.<ref name="shrinks"/> The change benefited more than two million people, most of them in the middle class.<ref name="shrinks"/>

The non-partisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimates that "about 4 million" (3.9 million or 1.2% of the [[List of countries by population|population]]) will pay the penalty in 2016.<ref>Congressional Budget Office, "[http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12033/12-23-selectedhealthcarepublications.pdf Selected CBO Publications Related to Health Care Legislation, 2009-2010]," Congress of the United States, December 2010, pp 71,73.</ref> In September 2012, the CBO estimated that nearly six million will pay a $1,200&nbsp;penalty in 2016. Also, nearly 80&nbsp;percent of those who will face the penalty would be making up to or less than five times the federal poverty level. This would work out to $55,850&nbsp;or less &nbsp;for an individual and $115,250&nbsp;or less for a family of four.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Alonso-Zaldivar|first=Ricardo|title=Tax penalty to hit nearly 6M uninsured people|publisher=Associated Press|date=2012-09-19|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jmIII4FgDvIW-bij_fdHF4v0Whbw?docId=48328c71af0241c39aef95fda77612f7|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ApAsoQ8h|archivedate=2012-09-20|deadurl=no }}</ref>

In January 2013, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] ruled that only the cost of covering the individual employee but not their family can be used for determining whether the cost of employer-based health coverage exceeds 9.5 percent of the worker’s household income, which is necessary to obtain taxpayer-subsidized coverage on the new health insurance exchanges starting in 2014. ''The New York Times'' said this could leave millions of Americans unable to afford family coverage under their employers’ plans and ineligible for subsidies to buy coverage elsewhere.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/a-cruel-blow-to-american-families.html "A Cruel Blow to American Families"] ''New York Times'', February 2, 2013</ref>

In March 2013, a report by The Lewin Group subsidiary of [[UnitedHealth Group]], sponsored and published by the [[Society of Actuaries]], predicted that insurers' claims costs in the individual health insurance market could rise an average of 32&nbsp;percent nationally by 2017. Insurers in some states could see claims costs in the individual health insurance market go up higher than that with increases estimated at 80&nbsp;percent in Ohio and Wisconsin, and 60&nbsp;percent in California, Idaho, Maryland and Indiana. States such as New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts could see decreases of 13–14&nbsp;percent in insurers' claims costs in the individual health insurance market, however. The effect on insurance premiums was outside the scope of the study and was not addressed in the report.  Larry Levitt, a health policy analyst from the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], cautioned that the Lewin Group study did not factor in efforts in the reform to control costs, and assumes huge increases in the individual market (which compromises just 6% of those under 65 currently); in contrast, Levitt said "I don't think anyone expects significant [cost] increases in the employer market," where the majority of Americans get their health insurance. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius also indicated that some cost increase in the individual market was expected because the standard of insurance allowed in the health care exchanges (run by the states or the federal government) would be higher quality than that generally available currently (and thus more expensive), and that the government subsidies provided to make insurance affordable weren't included in the Lewin Group estimates.<ref name="Haught 2013">{{cite web|author=Haught, Randy ([[UnitedHealth Group|The Lewin Group]]); Aherns, John ([[UnitedHealth Group|OptumInsight]])|date=March 26, 2013|title=Cost of the future newly insured under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)|location=Schaumburg|publisher=[[Society of Actuaries]]|url=http://cdn-files.soa.org/web/research-cost-aca-report.pdf|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}<br/>{{cite news|last=Aigner-Treworgy|first=Adam|date=March 27, 2013|title=Health care law will raise insurers' costs, actuaries say|work=CNN politicalticker... blog|publisher=[[CNN|CNN.com]]|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/27/health-care-law-will-raise-insurers-costs-actuaries-say/|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}<br/>{{cite web|last=Robertson|first=Lori|date=April 5, 2013|title=Health insurance premium spin|location=Philadelphia|publisher=[[FactCheck.org]]|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2013/04/insurance-premium-spin/|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}</ref>

====Coverage for contraceptives====

The PPACA includes a [[contraception|contraceptive]] coverage mandate that, with the exception of churches and houses of worship, applies to all employers and educational institutions. These regulations<ref name="Final Rule">{{cite web|title=Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – Final Rules|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2012-02-15/2012-3547/content-detail.html|publisher=Federal Register, GPO|accessdate=February 15, 2012|author=Dept.

The initial regulations proved controversial among Christian hospitals, [[Catholic Charities|Christian charities]], [[List of Roman Catholic universities and colleges in the United States|Catholic universities]], and other enterprises owned or controlled by religious organizations that oppose contraception on doctrinal grounds.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cohn|first=Jonathan|title=Religious Institutions Matter.

====CBO deficit reduction estimates====
[[File:CBO - Budget Impact of Affordable Care Act - March 2012.png|thumb|300px|right|CBO – Deficit reduction under ACA]]
The 2011 comprehensive CBO estimate projected a net deficit reduction of more than $200 billion during the period 2012–2021.<ref name="CBO22077">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/22077 |title=CBO's Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010 |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |date=March 30, 2011 |accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref><ref name="CBO43104">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43104 |title=Another Comment on CBO's Estimates for the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |date=March 16, 2012 |accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref> CBO estimated in March 2011 that for the 2012–2021 period, the law would result in net receipts of $813 billion, offset by $604 billion in outlays, resulting in a $210 billion reduction in the deficit.<ref name="CBO22077"/>

In 2012, the CBO updated its cost estimates for a portion of the bill, but did not update its estimate of the net deficit impact of the whole bill (which was still estimated to reduce budget deficits overall).<ref name="CBO43080"/> The ACA's provisions related to insurance coverage were projected earlier in 2012 to have a net cost of $1,252 billion over the 2012–2022 period; that amount represented a gross cost to the federal government of $1,762 billion, offset in part by $510 billion in receipts and other budgetary effects (primarily revenues from penalties and other sources). The addition of 2022 to the projection period had the effect of increasing the costs of the coverage provisions of the ACA relative to those projected in March 2011 for the 2012-2021 period because that change added a year in which the expansion of eligibility for Medicaid and the subsidies for health insurance purchased through the exchanges would have been in effect. This estimate was made prior to the Supreme Court's ruling regarding the expansion of Medicaid program to the individual states however.<ref name="CBO43076" /> CBO and JCT now estimate that the insurance coverage provisions of the ACA will have a net cost of $1,168 billion over the 2012–2022 period—compared with $1,252 billion projected in March 2012 for that 11-year period—for a net reduction of $84 billion. (Those figures do not include the budgetary impact of other provisions of the ACA, which in the aggregate reduce budget deficits.)<ref name="CBO43472">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43472 |title=CBO's Estimates for the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act Updated for the Recent Supreme Court Decision |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |date=July 24, 2012 |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>

[[Uwe Reinhardt]], a [[health economist]] at Princeton, wrote that "The rigid, artificial rules under which the Congressional Budget Office must score proposed legislation unfortunately cannot produce the best unbiased forecasts of the likely fiscal impact of any legislation", but went on to say "But even if the budget office errs significantly in its conclusion that the bill would actually help reduce the future federal deficit, I doubt that the financing of this bill will be anywhere near as fiscally irresponsible as was the financing of the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Modernization Act of 2003]]."<ref>{{cite news |title=Wrapping Your Head Around the Health Bill |author=[[Uwe Reinhardt]] |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 24, 2010 |url=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/wrapping-your-head-around-the-health-bill/ |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>

[[Douglas Holtz-Eakin]], CBO director during the George W. Bush administration, who later served as the chief economic policy adviser to U.S. Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, alleged that the bill would increase the deficit by $562&nbsp;billion because, he argued, it front-loaded revenue and back-loaded benefits.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/opinion/21holtz-eakin.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Real Arithmetic of Health Care Reform | first=Douglas | last=Holtz-Eakin | date=March 21, 2010}}</ref>

''[[The New Republic]]'' editors [[Noam Scheiber]] (an economist) and [[Jonathan Cohn]] (a noted health care policy analyst), countered critical assessments of the law's deficit impact, arguing that it is as likely, if not more so, for predictions to have underestimated deficit reduction than to have overestimated it. They noted that it is easier, for example, to account for the cost of definite levels of subsidies to specified numbers of people than account for savings from [[Preventive medicine|preventive health care]], and that the CBO has a track record of consistently overestimating the costs of, and underestimating the savings of health legislation;<ref>{{cite news |title=Is the CBO Biased Against Health Care Reform? |author=Noam Scheiber |work=The New Republic |date=September 17, 2009 |url=http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-stash/the-cbo-biased-against-health-care-reform }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite news |title=The GOP's Trick Play |author=Jonathan Cohn |work= The New Republic |date=January 21, 2011 |url=http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/81941/trick-play }}</ref> "innovations in the delivery of medical care, like greater use of [[electronic medical record]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalrecords.com/physicians/electronic-medical-records-deadline |title=Electronic Medical Records (Health Information Technology)}}</ref> and financial incentives for more coordination of care among doctors, would produce substantial savings while also slowing the relentless climb of medical expenses... But the CBO would not consider such savings in its calculations, because the innovations hadn't really been tried on such large scale or in concert with one another – and that meant there wasn't much hard data to prove the savings would materialize."<ref name=autogenerated3 />

[[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David Walker]], former [[Comptroller General of the United States|U.S. Comptroller General]] now working for [[The Peter G. Peterson Foundation]], has stated that the CBO estimates are not likely to be accurate, because it is based on the assumption that Congress is going to do everything they say they're going to do.<ref name="deficit_david_walker_cbo_innacurate">{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/03/health_overhaul_another_promis.html|title=Health Overhaul Another Promise U.S. Can't Afford: Expert|last=James|first=Frank|date=March 19, 2010|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2010-04-07}}</ref> The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] objected: in its analysis, Congress has a good record of implementing Medicare savings.

====Effect on health care cost trends====
In a May 2010 presentation on "Health Costs and the Federal Budget", CBO stated:
:Rising health costs will put tremendous pressure on the federal budget during the next few decades and beyond. In CBO's judgment, the health legislation enacted earlier this year does not substantially diminish that pressure.

CBO further observed that "a substantial share of current spending on health care contributes little if anything to people's health" and concluded, "Putting the federal budget on a sustainable path would almost certainly require a significant reduction in the growth of federal health spending relative to current law (including this year's health legislation)."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11544/Presentation5-26-10.pdf |title=Health Costs and the Federal Budget |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref>

Jonathan Gruber, an influential consultant who helped develop both the Affordable Care Act and the Massachusetts Health Care reform that preceded it, acknowledges that the Affordable Care Act is not ''guaranteed'' to significantly 'bend the curve' of rising health care costs: 
:"The real question is how far the ACA will go in slowing cost growth. Here, there is great uncertainty—mostly because there is such uncertainty in general about how to control cost growth in health care. There is no shortage of good ideas for ways of doing so... There is, however, a shortage of evidence regarding which approaches will actually work—and therefore no consensus on which path is best to follow.  In the face of such uncertainty, the ACA pursued the path of considering a range of different approaches to controlling health care costs... Whether these policies by themselves can fully solve the long run health care cost problem in the United States is doubtful. They may, however, provide a first step towards controlling costs—and understanding what does and does not work to do so more broadly."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/6829 |last=Gruber|first=Jonathan|title=The Impacts Of The Affordable Care Act: How Reasonable Are The Projections?}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Gruber|first=Jonathan|title=Health Care Reform: What It Is, Why It's Necessary, How It Works|year=2011|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=United States|isbn=978-0-8090-5397-1|pages=101}}</ref>

The [[Business Roundtable]], an association of [[CEOs]], commissioned a report from the [[Consultant|consulting company]] [[Hewitt Associates]] that found that the legislation "could potentially reduce that trend line by more than $3,000 per employee, to $25,435" with respect to insurance premiums. It also stated that the legislation "could potentially reduce the rate of future health care cost increases by 15% to 20% when fully phased in by 2019". The group cautioned that this is all assuming that the cost-saving government pilot programs both succeed and then are wholly copied by the private market, which is uncertain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/19/barack-obama/obama-says-health-reform-legislation-could-reduce-/|title=Obama says health reform legislation could reduce costs in employer plans by up to $3,000|last=Farley|first=Robert|date=March 19, 2010|publisher=PolitiFact.com|accessdate=2010-04-07}}</ref>

====Expenditure estimates====
In 2012, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) projected PPACA will require more than $1.7 trillion in gross federal spending over the period 2012–2022, some of which will be offset by penalties and tax increases related to coverage, resulting in net spending of more than $1.2 trillion for the insurance portion of the bill. However, this is only a partial accounting for the impact of the bill, excluding some offsetting expense reductions and revenue increases that result in a net deficit reduction.<ref name=fewer>{{cite web|last=Pecquet |first=Julian |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/health-reform-implementation/215795-cbo-health-law-to-cost-less-cover-fewer-people-than-first-thought |title=CBO: Obama's health law to cost less, cover fewer people than first thought – The Hill's Healthwatch |publisher=Thehill.com |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref><ref name="CBO43076" /><ref name="CBO43080">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43080 |title=CBO Releases Updated Estimates for the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate= |quote=''Supplemented by'' [http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43104 Another Comment on CBO's Estimates for the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act], March 16, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sahadi |first=Jeanne |url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/13/news/economy/health-reform-costs |title=Health reform coverage cost falls slightly – Mar. 13, 2012 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date= March 13, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref>

====Public opinion====
Polls indicate support of health care reform in general, but became more negative in regards to specific plans during the legislative debate over 2009 and 2010, and the Act that was ultimately signed in 2010 remains controversial with opinions falling along party lines. Polling averages show a plurality with negative opinions of the law, with those in favor trailing by single digits.<ref name="swanson">{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/30/healthplan_n_725503.html | work=The Huffington Post | first=Emily | last=Swanson | title=Health Care Plan: Favor / Oppose | date=July 30, 2009}}</ref><ref name="rcp">{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_and_democrats_health_care_plan-1130.html |title=Obama and Democrats' Health Care Plan |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' found opinions were starkly divided by age, with a solid majority of seniors opposing the bill and a solid majority of those younger than 40 in favor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-03-23-health-poll-favorable_N.htm|title=Poll: Health care plan gains favor|last=Page|first=Susan|date=March 24, 2010|work=USA Today|accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref>

Specific elements are very popular across the political spectrum, with the notable exception of the mandate to purchase insurance. Democrats favor the law, while most Republicans and Independents did not. For example, a Reuters-Ipsos poll during June 2012 indicated the following:
*56% of Americans overall were against the law, with 44% supporting it. By party affiliation, 75% of Democrats, 27% of Independents, and 14% of Republicans favored the law overall.
*82% favored banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.
*61% favored allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26.
*72% supported requiring companies with more than 50 employees to provide insurance for their employees.
*61% opposed requiring all U.S. residents to own health insurance. By party affiliation, 19% of Republicans, 27% of Independents, and 41% of Democrats favored the mandate that all Americans buy health insurance.<ref name=most>{{cite news|last=Zengerle |first=Patricia |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/24/us-usa-campaign-healthcare-idUSBRE85N01M20120624 |title=Reuters-Most Americans Oppose Health Law But Like the Provisions|publisher=Reuters.com |date= June 24, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}</ref>

====Term "Obamacare"====

The term "Obamacare" was originally coined by opponents, notably Mitt Romney in 2007, as a pejorative term. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the term was first put in print in March 2007, when health care lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott penned it in a health industry journal. "We will soon see a '[[Rudy Giuliani|Giuliani]]-care' and 'Obama-care' to go along with '[[John McCain|McCain]]-care,' '[[John Edwards|Edwards]]-care,' and a totally revamped and remodeled '[[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]]-care' [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|from the 1990s]]", Schulte Scott wrote.<ref name="CNN20120625Obamacare" /><ref name="NYT20120325">{{cite news|title=Fighting to Control the Meaning of ‘Obamacare’|url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/25/us/politics/fighting-to-control-the-meaning-of-obamacare.html|accessdate=June 29, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 25, 2012|author=Amanda Cox, Alicia Desantis and Jeremy White}}</ref> The expression Obamacare first was used in early 2007 generally by writers describing the candidate’s proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured according to research by Elspeth Reeve at [[The Atlantic]] magazine.<ref name="NYT20120803" /> The word was first uttered in a political campaign by [[Mitt Romney]] in May 2007 in [[Des Moines]], [[Iowa]]. Romney said: "[[Massachusetts health care reform|In my state, I worked on health care for some time.]] We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over health care'. And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care.

==Repeal efforts==

===111th Congress===
Reps. [[Steve King]] of [[Iowa]] and [[Michele Bachmann]] of [[Minnesota]], both Republicans, introduced bills in the House to repeal PPACA shortly after it was passed, as did Sen. [[Jim DeMint]] in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Brien |first=Michael |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/88323-house-and-senate-republicans-quick-to-release-repeal-bills |title=GOP quick to release 'repeal' bills |work=The Hill |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> None of the three bills were considered by either body.

===112th Congress===
In 2011, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted 245–189 to approve a bill entitled "Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act" (H.R.2),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR00002:|title=Bill Summary & Status – 112th Congress (2011–2012) – H.R. 2 |publisher=[[THOMAS]] |date=2011-01-19}}</ref> which, if enacted, would repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the health care-related text of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

On June 28, 2012, following the law being ruled as constitutional by the Supreme Court, House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] stated that the House would again vote to repeal the law in July when Congress returns from recess.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2012-06-28/health-care-romney-obama/55893858/1?csp=34news |title=Romney, GOP leaders pledge to repeal health care law |newspaper=USA Today |last=Kucinich |first=Jackie |date=June 28, 2012 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303561504577494682627914026.html |title=Romney, GOP Pledge to Repeal Health Law |last=Boles |first=Corey |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=June 28, 2012 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77939.html |title=Health care decision: House GOP to renew repeal effort |last1=Sherman |first1=Jake |last2=Raju |first2=Manu |last3=Kim |first3=Seung Min |work=Politico |date=June 28, 2012 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref> On July 11, 2012, the House of Representatives voted to repeal the law with 5 Democrats and all 239 Republicans voting in favor of the repeal.<ref name="H.R.6079">{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/07/11/house-approves-obamacare-repeal-in-first-vote-since-court-ruling/ | publisher=FoxNews | title=House approves ObamaCare repeal in first vote since Supreme Court ruling| date=July 11, 2012}}</ref><ref name="thirtythree">{{cite news| url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/house-obamacare-repeal-thirty-third-times-the-charm/ | publisher=ABC News | title=House Obamacare Repeal: Thirty-Third Time’s the Charm? | date=July 11, 2012}}</ref> This was the 31st effort by the House of Representatives to repeal the bill in the 112th Congress.<ref name="thirtyone">{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-07-11/health/bal-republicans-repeal-health-reform_1_house-votes-repeal-care-reform-bill |title=House of representatives votes to repeal health reform for the 31st time |last1=Walker |first1=Andrea K. |work=Baltimore Sun |date=July 11, 2012 |accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref> With President Obama's reelection and the Democrats expanding their majority in the Senate following the [[United States general elections, 2012|2012 elections]], Republicans conceded that repeal almost certainly will not occur.<ref>http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/health-reform-implementation/266689-conservatives-are-begin-to-admit-defeat-in-their-three-year-war-against-obamacare</ref>

====Job consequences of repeal====
One argument put forth in favor of repeal was that, as stated by a spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, "This is a job-killing law, period."<ref name="jobkilling"/> The House Republican leadership justified its use of the term "job killing" by contending that PPACA would lead to a loss of 650,000 jobs, and attributing that figure to a report by the Congressional Budget Office.<ref name="jobkilling">{{cite web | last = Jackson | first = Brooks | coauthors = Lori Robertson| title = A 'Job-Killing' Law?| publisher = [[FactCheck]] | date = January 7, 2011| url = http://factcheck.org/2011/01/a-job-killing-law/ | accessdate = 2011-01-23}}</ref> However, [[FactCheck]] noted the 650,000 figure was not included in the CBO report that was referred to, and said that the Republican statement "badly misrepresents what the Congressional Budget Office has said about the law. In fact, CBO is among those saying the effect [on employment] 'will probably be small.'"<ref name="jobkilling"/> [[PolitiFact]] also rated the Republican statement as False.<ref>{{cite web | last = Farley | first = Robert | coauthors = Angie Drobnic Holan | title = The health care law a 'job killer'? The evidence falls short | publisher = [[PolitiFact.com]] | date = January 20, 2011 | url = http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/20/eric-cantor/health-care-law-job-killer-evidence-falls-short/ | accessdate = 2011-01-23}}</ref> 

[[Jonathan Cohn]], citing the projections of the CBO, summarized that the primary employment effect of the PPACA is to alleviate job-lock: "people who are only working because they desperately need employer-sponsored health insurance will no longer do so."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cohn|first=Jonathan|title=Sorry, The CBO Did Not Say Health Reform Kills 800,000 Jobs.|url=http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/jonathan-chait/83310/sorry-the-cbo-did-not-say-health-reform-kills-800000-jobs }}</ref> He concluded that "reform’s only significant employment impact was a reduction in the labor force, primarily because people holding onto jobs just to keep insurance could finally retire"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cohn|first=Jonathan|title=Obamacare, Good for the Economy.|url=http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/plank/104035/obamacare-romney-economy-benefit-job-regulation-noam }}</ref> once they have health insurance outside of their jobs.

====Effect of repeal proposals on federal budget projections====
The non-partisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimated that repealing the entire PPACA (including both its taxing and spending provisions) would increase the net 2011–2021 federal deficit by $210&nbsp;billion.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Republican politicians disagreed, arguing that estimate was based on unrealistic assumptions; House Speaker [[John Boehner]] said, "I don't think anyone in this town believes that repealing Obamacare is going to increase the deficit."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/01/06/health.care/index.html | publisher=CNN | title=Analysis: Health care repeal will cost $230&nbsp;billion | date=January 6, 2011}}</ref> In May 2011, CBO analyzed proposals to prevent the use of appropriated funds to implement the legislation, and wrote that "a temporary prohibition, extending through the remainder of fiscal year 2011, would reduce the budget deficit by about $1.4&nbsp;billion in 2011 but would increase deficits by almost $6&nbsp;billion over the 2011–2021 period... CBO cannot determine whether changes in spending under a permanent prohibition would produce net costs or net savings relative to its baseline projection, which assumes full implementation."<ref name="CBO41472">{{cite web|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/41472 |title = Analysis Of A Permanent Prohibition On Implementing The Major Health Care Legislation Enacted In March 2010 |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |date=May 26, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref>

Revised CBO accounting, based on the latest repeal effort passed in the House of Representatives (H.R.&nbsp;6079) on July 11, 2012 and taking into account the Supreme Court's ruling concerning the expansion of Medicaid by the States, that, on balance, the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting the ''Repeal of Obamacare Act'' legislation would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of $109&nbsp;billion over the 2013–2022 period. Specifically, CBO estimates that H.R.&nbsp;6079 would reduce direct spending by $890&nbsp;billion and reduce revenues by $1&nbsp;trillion between 2013 and 2022, thus adding $109&nbsp;billion to federal budget deficits over that period.<ref name="H.R.6079" /><ref name="CBO43471">{{cite web |url=http://cbo.gov/publication/43471 |title=Letter to the Honorable John Boehner providing an estimate for H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare Act |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |date=July 24, 2012 |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}</ref>

==Temporary waivers==
Interim regulations have been put in place for a specific type of employer-funded insurance, the so-called "mini-med" or limited-benefit plans, which are low-cost to employers who buy them for their employees, but cap coverage at a very low level. Such plans are sometimes offered to low-paid and part-time workers, for example in fast food restaurants or purchased direct from an insurer. Most company-provided health insurance policies starting on or after September 23, 2010 and before September 23, 2011 may not set an annual coverage cap lower than $750,000,<ref name="ELYB">[http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/limits/limits.html The Affordable Care Act: Eliminating Limits on Your Benefits] HHS web site</ref> a lower limit that is raised in stages until 2014, by which time no insurance caps are allowed at all. By 2014, no health insurance, whether sold in the individual or group market, will be allowed to place an annual cap on coverage. The waivers have been put in place to encourage employers and insurers offering mini-med plans not to withdraw medical coverage before the full regulations come into force (by which time small employers and individuals will be able to buy non-capped coverage through the exchanges) and are granted only if the employer can show that complying with the limit would mean a significant decrease in employees' benefits coverage or a significant increase in employees' premiums.<ref name="ELYB" />

Among those receiving waivers were employers, large insurers, such as [[Aetna]] and [[Cigna]], and union plans covering about one million employees. [[McDonald's]], one of the employers that received a waiver, has 30,000 hourly employees whose plans have annual caps of $10,000. The waivers are issued for one year and can be reapplied for.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/07insure.html | work=The New York Times | first=Reed | last=Abelson | title=U.S. Waivers After Threats of Lost Health Coverage | date=October 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/business/2782232,Waivers-on-healthreform.article | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | title=30 Companies Get One-Year Waiver From Health Reform Rule | date=October 7, 2010}}</ref> Referring to the adjustments as "a balancing act", [[Nancy-Ann DeParle]], director of the Office of Health Reform at the White House, said, "The president wants to have a smooth glide path to 2014."<ref name="nytimes.com"/> On January 26, 2011, HHS said it had to date granted a total of 733 waivers for 2011, covering 2.1&nbsp;million people, or about 1% of the privately insured population.<ref>"[http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/approved_applications_for_waiver.html Annual Limits Policy: Protecting Consumers, Maintaining Options, and Building a Bridge to 2014]", HHS-CMS-CCIIO, see section "Applications for Waiver of the Annual Limits Requirements"</ref> In June 2011, the Obama Administration announced that all applications for new waivers and renewals of existing ones have to be filed by September 22 of that year, and no new waivers would be approved after this date.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43445375/ns/politics/ |title=Obama administration to end health care waivers |agency=Associated Press |publisher=msnbc.com |date=June 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref>
