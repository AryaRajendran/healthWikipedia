The '''Shanghai Stem Cell Institute''' is an institute in [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China]] dedicated to [[stem cell research]].

==The institute==
The institute, located within the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] under the [[School of Medicine]] faculty, is entirely funded by the government of the People's Republic of China.<ref name=niche>[http://blogs.nature.com/reports/theniche/2007/12/shanghai_stem_cell_conference_1.html Shanghai stem cell conference promises more to come]</ref><ref>Linzhao Cheng, Lei Xiao, Fanyi Zeng and Alex Zhang, 10 January 2008, [http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/abstract/S1934-5909%2807%2900326-8 Stem Cells Shine in Shanghai]</ref>

In 2007, the first Shanghai International Symposium on Stem Cell Research took place at the Shanghai Jiatong University, in which the institute first received widespread notage.<ref name=niche/>

==IPS cell breakthrough==
On July 24, 2009, the first publication of a successful breakthrough in [[Stem cell research]] was released,<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124839803784477915.html Chinese Scientists Reprogram Cells to Create Mice] - WSJ</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1912375,00.html Mice Research Shows Promise of Adult Stem Cells] - TIME</ref> where Chinese researchers from the Shanghai Stem Cell Institute, led by Professor Fanyi Zeng, successfully reprogrammed [[adult stem cell]]s to be able to differentiate into any body cell, as in the case with standard [[embryonic stem cell]]s, the cells in question known as "[[induced pluripotent stem cells]]" (IPS cells). The IPS cells were obtained by genetically reprogramming the skin cells of mice to acts like embryonic stem cells, which then were able to differentiate into all forms of body tissue.<ref name=webmd>[http://www.webmd.com/news/20090723/mice-made-from-mouse-skin-cells Mice Made From Mouse Skin Cells: Chinese Studies Confirm Potential of Skin Cells Reprogrammed to Act Like Embryonic Stem Cells] - WebMD</ref> The researchers have managed to use the IPS cells to create every type of cell in a mouse, creating entire mouse pups using the technique. This is the first time the technique has been used to make an entire mouse.

This breakthrough, published in the journals ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''Cell Stem Cell'' and developed independently by two teams in China, may possibly depreciate the usage of stem cells obtained from human embryos.<ref name=abc>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/24/2635308.htm Mice pups bred from adult stem cells] - Australian Broadcasting Corporation</ref> The oldest living mice created by the technique are nine months old and are reproducing, albeit showing signs of abnormalities. "This gives us hope for future therapeutic intervention using patients' own re-programmed cells in our far future," according to Professor [[Zeng Fanyi|Fanyi Zeng]].<ref name=abc/> A total of 27 mice were successfully born from the first generation of mice created from the IPS cells which were able to reproduce without any issues.<ref name=webmd/>
