{{hatnote|This article is about avulsion injuries other than [[Avulsion fracture|fractures]]. For non-medical uses, see [[Avulsion (disambiguation)]].}}

In [[medicine]], an '''avulsion''' is an injury in which a body structure is forcibly detached from its normal point of insertion by either [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] or surgery (from the Latin ''avellere'', meaning "to tear off").<ref>{{cite web|title=Avulsion|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/avulsion|work=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref> The term most commonly refers to a surface trauma where all layers of the [[skin]] have been torn away, exposing the underlying structures (i.e.â€”[[subcutaneous tissue]], [[muscle]], [[tendons]], or [[bone]]). This is similar to an [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasion]] but more severe, as body parts such as an eyelid or an ear can be partially or fully detached from the body.

==Types of avulsions==
* Skin

* Ear
* Eyelid
* Nail
* Nerve (brachial plexus)
* Tooth
* Periosteal
* Surgical


==Skin avulsions==
The most common avulsion injury, skin avulsions usually occur during motor vehicle collisions. The severity of avulsion ranges from skin flaps (minor) to [[degloving]] (moderate) and [[amputation]] of a finger or limb (severe). [[fascia|Suprafascial]] avulsions are those in which the depth of the removed skin reaches the [[subcutaneous tissue]] layer, while subfascial avulsions extend deeper than the subcutaneous layer.<ref name="jeng">Jeng, S.F., & Wei, F.C. (1997, May). Classification and reconstructive options in foot plantar skin avulsion injuries. '' Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery, 99(6)'', 1695-1703.</ref> Small suprafascial avulsions can be repaired by suturing, but most avulsions require skin grafts or reconstructive surgery.

===Rock climbing===
In [[rock climbing]], a "flapper" is an injury in which parts of the skin are torn off, resulting in a loose flap of skin on the fingers.<ref>[http://www.rockclimbing.com/Articles/Introduction_to_Climbing/Climbing_Dictionary_528.html#f]</ref> This is usually the result of friction forces between the climber's fingers and the [[Climbing hold|holds]], arising when the climber slips off a hold.

To fix this injury and to be able to continue climbing, many climbers will apply sports tape to the flapped finger to cover up the sensitive area of broken skin. Some climbers may even use super-glue to adhere the loose skin back to the finger.

==Ear avulsions==
The ear is particularly vulnerable to avulsion injuries because of its position on the side of the head.<ref name="medscape">Davison, S. P., & Bosley, B. N. (2008). ''Ear, Reconstruction and Salvage''. Retrieved January 15, 2009, from [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1288828-overview].</ref> The most common cause of ear avulsions is human bites, followed by falls, motor vehicle collisions, and dog bites.<ref name="medscape" /> A partially avulsed ear can be reattached through [[suturing]] or [[microvascular surgery]], depending on the severity of the injury.<ref>Nahai, F., Hayhurst, J.

==Eyelid avulsions==
[[Eyelid]] avulsions are uncommon,<ref>Goldberg, S.H., Bullock, J.D., & Connelly, P.J. (1992). Eyelid avulsion: A clinical and experimental study. ''Ophthalmic Plastic And Reconstructive Surgery, 8(4)'', 256-261.</ref> but can be caused by motor vehicle collisions,<ref name="huerva" /> dog bites,<ref name="avram">Avram, D.R., Hurwitz, J.J., & Kratky, V.

''Canadian Journal Of Ophthalmology, 26(6)'', 334-337.</ref><ref name="soueid" /> or human bites.<ref name="avram" /> Eyelid avulsions are repaired by [[suturing]] after a [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] is performed to determine where damage to the muscles, nerves, and blood vessels of the eyelid has occurred.<ref name="huerva">Huerva, V., Mateo, A.J., & Espinet, R. (2008, January). Isolated medial rectus muscle rupture after a traffic accident. ''Strabismus, 16(1)'', 33-37.</ref> More severe injuries require [[Reconstructive plastic surgery|reconstruction]], however, this usually results in some loss of function and subsequent surgeries may be necessary to improve structure and function.<ref>deSousa, J.L., Leibovitch, I., Malhotra, R., O'Donnell, B., Sullivan, T., & Selva, D.

(2006, January). Microsurgical replantation of total upper eyelid avulsion. ''Annals of Plastic Surgery, 56(1)'', 99-102.</ref> Sometimes [[Botox#Medical_uses|botulinum toxin]] is injected into the eyelid to paralyze the muscles while the eyelid heals.<ref name="huerva" />

==Nail avulsions==
Trauma to the [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] can cause the nail plate to be torn from the nail bed.<ref>[http://www.utahmountainbiking.com/firstaid/nailavul.htm Nail Avulsions]</ref> Unlike other types of avulsion, when a nail is lost, it is not typically reattached. Following the loss of the nail, the nail bed forms a germinal layer which hardens as the cells acquire [[keratin]] and becomes a new nail.<ref>Rischer, C.E., & Easton, T.A. (1995). ''Focus on human biology'' (2<sup>nd</sup>ed.). New York: Harper Collins College Publishers.</ref> Until this layer has formed, the exposed nail bed is highly sensitive, and is typically covered with a non-adherent [[Dressing (medical)|dressing]], as an ordinary dressing will stick to the nail bed and cause pain upon removal.<ref>National Center for Emergency Medicine Informatics. ''Nail Off''. Retrieved January 16, 2009, from [http://www.ncemi.org/cse/cse1004.htm].</ref> In the average person, fingernails require 3 to 6 months to regrow completely, while toenails require 12 to 18 months.

==Brachial plexus avulsions==
In [[brachial plexus]] avulsions, the brachial plexus (a bundle of nerves that communicates signals between the spine and the arms, shoulders, and hands) is torn from its attachment to the [[spinal cord]]. One common cause of brachial plexus avulsions is when a baby's shoulders rotate in the birth canal during delivery, which causes the brachial plexus to stretch and tear.<ref>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. ''NINDS Erb-Duchenne and Dejerine-Klumpke Palsies Information Page''. Retrieved January 15, 2009, from [http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brachial_plexus_birth/brachial_plexus_birth.htm].</ref> It occurs in 1-2 out of every 1,000 births.<ref>American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. ''Erb's Palsy (Brachial Plexus Birth Injury)''. Retrieved January 15, 2009, from [http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00077&return_link=0].</ref> Shoulder trauma during motor vehicle collisions is another common cause of brachial plexus avulsions.<ref name="binder">Binder, D. K., Lu, D. C., & Barbaro, N. M. (2005, October). Multiple root avulsions from the brachial plexus. ''Neurosurgical Focus, 19(3)''.</ref> Detachment of the nerves can cause pain and loss of function in the arms, shoulders, and hands. [[Neuropathic pain]] can be treated with medication, but function can only be restored through surgical reattachment or nerve grafts.<ref name="binder" /> For intractable pain, a procedure called [[Cancer pain#Neurosurgery|dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning]] can be effective.<ref name="binder" />

==Tooth avulsions==
During a tooth avulsion, a tooth is completely or partially (such that the [[dental pulp]] is exposed) detached from its [[Tooth socket|socket]]. Secondary (permanent) teeth can be replaced and stabilised by a dentist.<ref name="merck">Merck Manual Online. ''Fractured and Avulsed Teeth''. Retrieved January 15, 2009, from [http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec08/ch096/ch096b.html?qt=avulsion&alt=sh].</ref> Primary (baby) teeth are not replaced because they tend to become infected and to interfere with the growth of the secondary teeth.<ref name="merck" /> A completely avulsed tooth that is replaced within one hour of the injury can be permanently retained.<ref name="merck" /> The long-term retention rate decreases as the time that the tooth is detached increases, and eventually [[root resorption]] makes replacement of the tooth impossible.<ref name="merck" /> To minimize damage to the root, the tooth should be kept in milk or sterile [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] while it is outside the mouth.<ref name="merck" /><ref name="mosby">Kidd, P. S., Sturt, P. A., & Fultz, J. (2000). ''Mosby's emergency nursing reference'' (2nd <sup>ed</sup>.). St. Louis: Mosby, Inc.</ref>

==Periosteal avulsions==
During a periosteal avulsion, the [[periosteum]] (a fibrous layer that surrounds a bone) detaches the bone's surface. An example of a periosteal avulsion is an [[Alpsa lesion|ALPSA]] (anterior labral periosteal sleeve avulsion).

==Surgical avulsions==
An avulsion is sometimes performed surgically to relieve symptoms of a disorder, or to prevent a chronic condition from recurring. Small incision avulsion (also called [[ambulatory phlebectomy]]) is used to remove [[varicose vein]]s from the legs in disorders such as [[chronic venous insufficiency]].<ref>Society for Vascular Surgery. ''VascularWeb: Chronic Venous Insufficiency''. Retrieved January 15, 2009, from [http://www.vascularweb.org/patients/NorthPoint/Chronic_Venous_Insufficiency.html].</ref> A nail avulsion is performed to remove all or part of a chronic [[ingrown nail]].<ref>American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. ''Ingrown Toenail''. Retrieved January 15, 2009, from [http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00154&return_link=0].</ref> [[Facial nerve]] avulsion is used to treat the involuntary twitching involved in [[Blepharospasm|benign essential blepharospasm]].<ref name="mccord">McCord, C.D. Jr., Coles, W.H., Shore, J.W., Spector, R., & Putnam, J.R. (1984, February). Treatment of essential blepharospasm: Comparison of facial nerve avulsion and eyebrow-eyelid muscle stripping procedure.
