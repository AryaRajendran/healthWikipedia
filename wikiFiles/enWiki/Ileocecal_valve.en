The '''ileocecal valve''', or '''ileocaecal valve''', is a papillose structure with physiological [[sphincter muscle]] situated at the junction of the [[small intestine]] (ileum) and the [[large intestine]], with recent evidence indicating an anatomical sphincter may also be present in humans.<ref name=IC>{{cite journal | last1 = Pollard | first1 = MF | last2 = Thompson-Fawcett | first2 = MW | last3 = Stringer | first3 = MD | title = The human ileocaecal junction: anatomical evidence of a sphincter | journal = Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–9 | year = 2012 | pmid = 21863224 | doi = 10.1007/s00276-011-0865-z }}</ref> Its critical function is to limit the reflux of colonic contents into the [[ileum]].<ref>Barret KE.

'The ileocecal valve is distinctive because it is the only site in the GI tract which is used for Vitamin B12 and bile acid absorption.[citation needed]'

Excerpt from abstract:
'The ileocaecal valve, however, does play a substantial role, in that, on the one hand, it performs sphincter and barrier functions against ileocolic reflux of bacteria, while, on the other, its removal involves excision of the right colon (reserve area for reabsorption of water and ions) and of the terminal ileum (a site specialized in absorption of vitamin B12 and bile salts).'

Excerpt from Abstract:
'The loss of the ileocecal valve and ileum segment accelerates intestinal transit time, which does not allow for complete digestion and absorption of food. Water and electrolytes remain associated with undigested food particles and may overwhelm the absorptive capacity of the colon, resulting in an osmotic diarrhea. A second problem is vitamin B12 deficiency. Surgical reduction of sites in the terminal ileum for active and exclusive uptake of vitamin B12 might lead to hypovitaminosis. If this is unrecognized, patients may develop irreversible neurologic injury.'

Functionally, roughly two litres of fluid enters the colon daily through the ileocecal valve.

==Histology==
The [[histology]] of the ileocecal valve shows an abrupt change from a [[Intestinal villus|villous]] mucosa pattern of the ileum to a more colonic mucosa. A thickening of the [[muscularis mucosa]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, which is the [[smooth muscle]] tissue found beneath the mucosal layer of the [[digestive tract]]. A thickening of the [[muscularis externa]] is also noted.<ref name=IC/>

There is also a variable amount of [[lymphatic tissue]] found at the valve.<ref>Burkitt HG, Young B, Heath JW.  ''Wheater's Functional Histology'': a text and colour atlas.  Churchill Livingstone, London, 1993.</ref>

==Clinical significance==
During [[colonoscopy]], the ileocecal valve is used, along with the [[Vermiform appendix|appendiceal orifice]], in the identification of the [[cecum]].  This is important, as it indicates that a complete colonoscopy has been performed.  The ileocecal valve is typically located on the last fold before entry into the cecum, and can be located from the direction of curvature of the appendiceal orifice, in what is known as the [[bow and arrow sign]].<ref>Cotton PB, Williams CB.  ''Practical Gastrointestinal Endoscopy'' Blackwell Publishers, London, 1996</ref>

Intubation of the ileocecal valve is typically performed in colonoscopy to evaluate the distal, or lowest part of the [[ileum]].  Small bowel endoscopy can also be performed by [[double-balloon enteroscopy]] through intubation of the ileocecal valve.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = AS | last2 = Waxman | first2 = I | last3 = Semrad | first3 = C | last4 = Dye | first4 = C | title = Balloon-assisted intubation of the ileocecal valve to facilitate retrograde double-balloon enteroscopy | journal = Gastrointestinal endoscopy | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 987–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16301054 | doi = 10.1016/j.gie.2005.09.002 }}</ref>

==Pathology==
[[Tumor]]s of the ileocecal valve are rare, but have been reported in the literature.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yörük | first1 = G | last2 = Aksöz | first2 = K | last3 = Buyraç | first3 = Z | last4 = Unsal | first4 = B | last5 = Nazli | first5 = O | last6 = Ekinci | first6 = N | title = Adenocarcinoma of the ileocecal valve: report of a case | journal = The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 268–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 16249985 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Song | first1 = HJ | last2 = Ko | first2 = BM | last3 = Cheon | first3 = YK | last4 = Ryu | first4 = CB | last5 = Lee | first5 = JS | last6 = Lee | first6 = MS | last7 = Shim | first7 = CS | title = Isolated ileocecal lymphoma | journal = Gastrointestinal endoscopy | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 293–4 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15729248 | doi = 10.1016/S0016-5107(04)02548-9 }}</ref>

==Etymology==
It was described by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physician [[Nicolaes Tulp]] (1593–1674), and thus it is sometimes known as '''Tulp's valve'''.
