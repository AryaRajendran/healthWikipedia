'''Uplifting Athletes''' is a non-profit organization of current American [[college football]] players, benefiting those with [[rare disease]]s. The group was established in 2003 and is a [[501(c)|501(c)3]].

The organization was founded in 2003 by a group of [[Penn State Nittany Lions football]] players who turned an annual [[Powerlifting|weightlifting]] competition into a [[fundraiser]]. [[Wide receiver]] Scott Shirley's father was diagnosed with [[Renal cell carcinoma|kidney cancer]] in 2003. When Shirley turned to his teammates for support, he discovered three others also had fathers battling the disease. Because so few (less than 200,000) Americans are diagnosed with kidney cancer, funds to fight the disease are scarce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/RareDiseaseList.aspx|title= Rare Diseases and Related Terms|publisher=National Institute of Health Office of Rare Diseases|accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref> Two of Shirley's teammates, [[offensive tackle]] Damone Jones and [[Center (American football)|center]] Dave Costlow, saw an opportunity for student-athletes to use their high-profile and access to the media to promote awareness and raise funds for under-served charities. The three formed Uplifting Athletes later that year.<ref name="Uplifting Athletes">{{cite web|url=http://www.upliftingathletes.org|title= Uplifting Athletes|publisher=Scott Shirley, Uplifting Athletes|accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref>

==Chapters==
Uplifting Athletes' founding chapter is at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]]. The football team there has designated the [[Kidney Cancer Assn.|Kidney Cancer Association]] as their charity. To date the team has raised over $300,000 dollars for that charity. The Penn State chapter raises funds through its annual weight-lifting competition, '''Lift for Life'''.<ref name="Uplifting Athletes"/> The competition features teams of four players competing in 11 strength and conditioning events, such as [[bench press]] and the "giant tire flip."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psuliftforlife.org/lfl/event_history.htm|title= Lift for Life|publisher=Lift for Life|accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref> 

Subsequent chapters have formed at other Universities.  Some of the earlier chapters to form include:
*A chapter at [[Boston College]] benefiting [[Ewing's sarcoma]]
*One at [[Colgate University]] benefiting [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]]
*A chapter at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] benefiting [[cystic fibrosis]]. 
*A chapter at [[Ohio State University]] has also chosen to support the Kidney Cancer Association. Members of OSU's football team hold a [[Electronic sports|video game tournament]] to support the cause. 
*There are also chapters and events in other states, from Florida to California.

In 2009, the Penn State and University of Maryland chapters of Uplifting Athletes hosted events for [[Rare Disease Day]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pennstate.scout.com/2/840030.html | accessdate=February 17, 2009 | date=February 17, 2009 | title=Uplifting Athletes Tackling Video Tourney | publisher=[[Scout.com]]}}</ref>

In June 2010, for the first time in Uplifting Athletes History, leaders of all current chapters met in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] at the offices of Uplifting Athletes for a conference to share ideas and learn how to improve the performance of their chapters. The student-athletes learned from industry experts and guest lecturers about such things a better decision making, budgeting, and marketing.<ref>http://upliftingathletes.org/uplifting-athletes-news/uplifting-athletes-leadership-conference-set-june-12-13</ref>
