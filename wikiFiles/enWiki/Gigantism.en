'''Gigantism''',  also known as '''giantism''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] γίγας ''gigas'', "[[wiktionary:giant|giant]]", plural γίγαντες ''gigantes''), is a condition characterized by excessive growth and height significantly above [[average height|average]]. In humans, this condition is caused by over-production of [[growth hormone]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000044375|Gigantism}}</ref> in childhood resulting in persons between 7 feet (84 inches) (2.13 m) and 9 feet (108 inches) (2.74 m) in height.

==Terminology==

The term is typically applied to those whose height is not just in the upper 1% of the population but several [[standard deviation]]s above mean for persons of the same sex, age, and ethnic ancestry. The term is seldom applied to those who are simply "tall" or "above average" whose heights appear to be the healthy result of normal [[genetics]] and nutrition. Gigantism is usually caused by a [[Pituitary adenoma|tumor on the pituitary gland]] of the brain. It causes growth of  the hands, face, and feet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.question.com/link/gigantis.html |title=Gigantism |publisher=Question.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref> In some cases the condition can be passed on genetically through a mutated gene.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/health/06giant.html In a Giant’s Story, a New Chapter Writ by His DNA - By Gina Kolata. The New York Times, January 5, 2011]</ref>

Other names somewhat obsolete for this pathology are hypersoma (Greek: ''hyper'' over the normal level; ''soma'' body) and somatomegaly (Greek; ''soma'' body, genitive ''somatos''  of the body; ''megas'', gen. ''megalou'' great).
In the past, while many of them were social outcasts because of their height, some (usually unintentionally) found employment in [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm I]]'s famous [[Potsdam Giants]] regiment.

Many of those who have been identified with gigantism have suffered from multiple health issues involving their [[circulatory system|circulatory]] or [[skeletal system]].

== In history, art and literature ==
{{main|Giant (mythology)}}
Reports of gigantism exist throughout history, with some nations and tribes taller than others.

The giants of Crete are listed in various historic sources, beginning with [[Helios|Titan]], a Greek mythological giant, and including Gigantus, after whom giants and gigantism are named.<ref>It is interesting to note that Goliath is a Greek name and that the [[Philistines]] originated from the Greek and other Mediterranean islands.</ref>  [[Rhodes]] is another island where giants were said to have lived, with the [[Colossus of Rhodes]] a giant statue of a giant patron god [[Helios]]. [[Goliath]], another giant, mentioned in the [[Bible]], was a Philistine warrior who was slain by David in a battle between the Israelites and the Philistines.

== Diagnosis ==
Hypersecretion of [[growth hormone]] causes gigantism in children and [[acromegaly]] in adults.  Evaluation of growth hormone hypersecretion cannot be excluded with a single normal GH level due to diurnal variation.  However, a random blood sample showing markedly elevated GH is adequate for diagnosis of GH hypersecretion.  Additionally, a high-normal GH level that fails to suppress with administration of glucose is also sufficient for a diagnosis of GH hypersecretion.<ref>De Mais, Daniel.  ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. ASCP Press, Chicago, 2009.</ref>

Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) is an excellent test for evaluation of GH hypersecretion.  It does not undergo diurnal variation and will thus be consistently elevated in GH hypersecretion and therefore patients with gigantism.  A single normal IGF-1 value will reliably exclude GH hypersecretion.<ref>De Mais, Daniel.  ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. ASCP Press, Chicago, 2009.</ref>
