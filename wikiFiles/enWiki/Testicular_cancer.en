'''Testicular cancer''' is [[cancer]] that develops in the [[testicle]]s, a part of the [[male]] reproductive system.

In the United States, between 7,500 and 8,000 diagnoses of testicular cancer are made each year.<ref>{{Cite book | year = 2003 | title = Cancer Facts and Figures 2003 | publication-place = Atlanta, GA | publisher = American Cancer Society | url = http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2003PWSecured.pdf | accessdate = 2008-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | year = 2007 | title = Cancer Facts and Figures 2007 | publication-place = Atlanta, GA | publisher = American Cancer Society | url = http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2007PWSecured.pdf | accessdate = 2008-04-24}}</ref> In the UK, approximately 2,000 men are diagnosed each year.<ref>[http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/testis/ CancerStats, 2007 UK incidence data], Cancer Research UK.</ref>  Over his lifetime, a man's risk of testicular cancer is roughly 1 in 250 (0.4%).

Testicular cancer has one of the highest cure rates of all cancers: in excess of 90 percent overall; almost 100 percent if it has not spread ([[Metastasis|metastasized]]).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=American Cancer Society |url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicularcancer/overviewguide/testicular-cancer-overview-survival-rates |accessdate=2012-11-10 |title=Testicular Cancer Overview}}</ref> Even for the relatively few cases in which malignant cancer has spread widely, modern [[chemotherapy]] offers a cure rate of at least 80%.<ref name=motzerjama>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1001/jama.299.6.672 |author= Feldman DR |coauthors= Bosl GJ, Sheinfeld J, Motzer RJ |date= February 13, 2008 |title= Medical treatment of advanced testicular cancer |journal= [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume= 299 |issue= 6 |pages= 672–684 |pmid= 18270356 |url= http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/299/6/672 |accessdate= June 24, 2011 }}</ref> 

Not all lumps on the testicles are tumors, and not all tumors are malignant (cancerous). There are many other conditions, such as [[testicular microlithiasis]], [[epididymal cyst]]s, and [[appendix testis]] (hydatid of Morgagni), which may be painful but are non-cancerous.

==Classification==
Although testicular cancer can be derived from any cell type found in the testicles, more than 95% of testicular cancers are [[germ cell tumor]]s.  Most of the remaining 5% are [[sex cord-gonadal stromal tumour]]s derived from [[Leydig cell]]s or [[Sertoli cell]]s.  Correct diagnosis is necessary to ensure the most effective and appropriate treatment.  To some extent, this can be done via blood tests for [[tumor marker]]s, but definitive diagnosis requires examination of the [[histology]] of a specimen by a [[pathologist]].

Most pathologists use the [[World Health Organization]] classification system for testicular tumours:<ref>Eble J.N., Sauter G., Epstein J.I., Sesterhenn I.A.

==Signs and symptoms==
One of the first signs of testicular cancer is often a lump or swelling in the testes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescent and adults including  routine testicular self-exams.<ref>{{cite web|title=Screening for Testicular Cancer|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspstest.htm|work=uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|publisher=[[United States Preventive Services Task Force{{!}}U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]]|accessdate=4 December 2011|month=April|year=2011}}</ref> However, the American Cancer Society suggests that some men should examine their testicles monthly, especially if they have a family history of cancer, and the American Urological Association recommends monthly testicular self examinations for all young men.<ref>{{cite web|title=Can testicular cancer be found early?|url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/TesticularCancer/DetailedGuide/testicular-cancer-detection|work=Testicular Cancer: Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Staging|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=4 December 2011|month=19 January|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Testicular Self Examination (TSE)|url=http://www.urologyhealth.org/urology/index.cfm?article=101|publisher=[[American Urological Association]]|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref>

It is not very common for testicular cancer to spread to other organs, apart from the lungs. However, if it has, the following symptoms may be present:

*shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]), [[cough]] or coughing up blood ([[hemoptysis]]) from metastatic spread to the lungs<ref name=harrison16th /><ref name=afp2008 />
*a lump in the neck due to metastases to the lymph nodes<ref name=harrison16th /><ref name=afp2008 />

==Genetic defects==
Most testicular germ cell tumors have too many [[chromosomes]], and most often they are [[triploid]] to [[tetraploid]]. An isochromosome 12p (the short arm of chromosome 12 on both sides of the same centromere) is present in about 80% of the testicular cancers, and also the other cancers usually have extra material from this chromosome arm through other mechanisms of genomic amplification.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Atkin NB, Baker MC |title=Specific chromosome change, i(12p), in testicular tumours? |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8311 |page=1349 |year=1982 |month=December |pmid=6128640 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Seminoma.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] (high magnification) of a [[seminoma]]. [[H&E stain]].]]
The main way testicular cancer is diagnosed is via a lump or mass inside the testis. More generally, if a young adult or adolescent has a single enlarged testicle, which may or may not be painful, this should give doctors reason to suspect testicular cancer.

Other conditions may also have symptoms similar to testicular cancer:
*[[Epididymitis]] or [[Epididymitis|epididymoorchitis]]
*[[Hematocele]]
*[[Varicocele]]

Incorrect or mistaken diagnosis can delay access to appropriate treatment; this is thought to occur in up to 25% of cases {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The nature of any palpated lump in the [[scrotum]] is often evaluated by scrotal [[ultrasound]], which can determine exact location, size, and some characteristics of the lump, such as cystic vs solid, uniform vs heterogeneous, sharply circumscribed or poorly defined. The extent of the disease is evaluated by [[CT scan]]s, which are used to locate [[metastasis|metastases]].

The [[differential diagnosis]] of testicular cancer requires examining the [[histology]] of tissue obtained from an [[inguinal orchiectomy]] - that is, surgical excision of the entire [[testis]] along with attached structures ([[epididymis]] and [[spermatic cord]]). A [[biopsy]] should not be performed, as it raises the risk of spreading cancer cells into the scrotum.

Inguinal orchiectomy is the preferred method because it lowers the risk of cancer cells escaping. This is because the lymphatic system of the scrotum, through which white blood cells (and, potentially, cancer cells) flow in and out, links to the lower extremities, while that of the testicle links to the back of the abdominal cavity (the [[retroperitoneum]]).  A transscrotal biopsy or orchiectomy will potentially leave cancer cells in the scrotum and create two routes for cancer cells to spread, while in an inguinal orchiectomy only the retroperitoneal route exists.

Blood tests are also used to identify and measure [[tumor marker]]s (usually [[protein]]s present in the bloodstream) that are specific to testicular cancer. [[Alpha-fetoprotein|AFP alpha1 feto protein]], [[Beta-HCG]], and [[Lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]] are the typical markers used to identify testicular cancer.

A pregnancy test may be used to identify high levels of Beta-HCG, however the first sign of testicular cancer is normally a lump.<ref>http://abcnews.go.com/Health/CancerPreventionAndTreatment/pregnancy-test-man-joke-reveals-testicular-cancer/story?id=17653036#.UJqDuG80UR8</ref>

===Staging===
After removal, the testicle is fixed with [[Bouin Solution|Bouin's solution]]<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=[[Journal of Clinical Pathology]]|title=DNA and RNA obtained from Bouin's fixed tissues|date=2011-09-29|work=cancer.org|pmc=1770606|volume=58|issue=3|pmid=15735167|last1=Bonin|first1=S|last2=Petrera|first2=F|last3=Rosai|first3=J|last4=Stanta|first4=G|pages=313–6|doi=10.1136/jcp.2004.016477|journal=Journal of clinical pathology}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2469362/|publisher=[[Journal of Clinical Pathology]]|title=Lectin-binding sites in normal human testis?|accessdate=29 September 2011|date=2011-09-29|work=cancer.org}}</ref> because it better conserves some morphological details such as nuclear conformation. Then the testicular tumor is staged by a [[pathologist]] according to the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors as published in the [[American Joint Committee on Cancer|AJCC]] Cancer Staging Manual.  Testicular cancer is categorized as being in one of three [[Cancer staging|stages]] ([[TNM staging system|which have subclassifications]]).  The size of the tumor in the testis is irrelevant to staging.<ref>http://www.cancerstaging.org/cstage/CSPart1Manual.pdf</ref>  In broad terms, testicular cancer is staged as follows:
*Stage I: the cancer remains localized to the [[testis]].
*Stage II: the cancer involves the testis and [[metastasis]] to [[Retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]] and/or [[Paraaortic lymph node]]s ([[lymph node]]s below the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]).
*Stage III: the cancer involves the testis and [[metastasis]] beyond the [[Retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]] and [[Paraaortic lymph node]]s.  Stage 3 is further subdivided into non-bulky stage 3 and bulky stage 3.<ref name="titleTesticular Cancer Resource Center's Staging Page">{{cite web |url=http://tcrc.acor.org/staging.html |title=Testicular Cancer Resource Center's Staging Page |accessdate=2007-12-13 |work=}}</ref>

Further information on the detailed staging system is available on the website of the [[American Cancer Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/TesticularCancer/DetailedGuide/testicular-cancer-staging|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|title=How is testicular cancer staged?|accessdate=12 July 2011|date=2011-01-19|work=cancer.org}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The three basic types of treatment are [[surgery]], [[radiation therapy]], and [[chemotherapy]].<ref>{{cite web
| url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/testicular/HealthProfessional/page8
| title=Testicular Cancer Treatment (PDQ)

}}</ref>

Surgery is performed by [[urologist]]s; radiation therapy is administered by [[radiation oncologist]]s; and chemotherapy is the work of medical [[oncologist]]s. In most patients with testicular cancer, the disease is cured readily with minimal long-term [[morbidity]]. While treatment success depends on the stage, the average survival rate after five years is around 95%, and stage 1 cancers cases (if monitored properly) have essentially a 100% survival rate (which is why prompt action, when testicular cancer is a possibility, is extremely important).

=== Initial treatment  (orchiectomy)===
 {{main|Orchiectomy}}
{{see also|Monorchism}}

The initial treatment for testicular cancer is surgery to remove the affected testicle (orchiectomy). While it may be possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a testis while leaving the testis functional, this is almost never done, as the affected testicle usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire testicle. Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that testicle.
 
Since only one testis is typically required to maintain fertility, hormone production, and other male functions, the afflicted testis is almost always removed completely in a procedure called [[inguinal orchiectomy]]. (The testicle is almost never removed through the scrotum; an incision is made beneath the belt line in the inguinal area.)  In the UK, the procedure is known as a '''radical orchidectomy'''.

===Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection (RPLND)===
In the case of [[nonseminoma]]s that appear to be stage I, surgery may be done on the [[Retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]]/[[Paraaortic lymph node|Paraaortic]] [[lymph node]]s (in a separate operation) to accurately determine whether the cancer is in stage I or stage II and to reduce the risk that [[malignant]] testicular cancer cells that may have [[Metastasis|metastasized]] to lymph nodes in the lower abdomen.  This surgery is called [[retroperitoneal lymph node dissection]] (RPLND).  However, this approach, while standard in many places, especially the United States, is out of favor due to costs and the high level of expertise required to perform successful surgery. The urologist may take extra care in the case of males who have not fathered children, to preserve the nerves involved in ejaculation.

Many patients are instead choosing surveillance, where no further surgery is performed unless tests indicate that the cancer has returned. This approach maintains a high cure rate because of the growing accuracy of surveillance techniques.

=== Adjuvant treatment ===
Since testicular cancers can spread, patients are usually offered [[adjuvant therapy|adjuvant treatment]] - in the form of [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiotherapy]] - to kill any cancerous cells that may exist outside of the affected testicle.   The type of adjuvant therapy depends largely on the [[histology]] of the tumor (i.e. the size and shape of its cells under the microscope) and the stage of progression at the time of surgery (i.e. how far cells has 'escaped' from the testicle, invaded the surrounding tissue, or spread to the rest of the body). If the cancer is not particularly advanced, patients may be offered careful surveillance by periodic [[CT scans]] and blood tests, in place of adjuvant treatment.

Before 1970, survival rates from testicular cancer were low. Since the introduction of [[adjuvant therapy|adjuvant chemotherapy]], chiefly platinum-based drugs like [[cisplatin]] and [[carboplatin]], the outlook has improved substantially. Although 7000 to 8000 new cases of testicular cancer occur in the United States yearly, only 400 men are expected to die of the disease.

In the UK, a similar trend has emerged: since improvements in treatment, survival rates have risen rapidly to cure rates of over 95%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Testicular Cancer survival statistics|url=http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/testis/survival/|work=cancerresearchuk.org|publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]]|accessdate=4 December 2011|month=9 October|year=2009}}</ref>

===Radiation therapy===
[[Radiation]] may be used to treat stage 2 seminoma cancers, or as [[adjuvant]] (preventative) therapy in the case of stage 1 seminomas, to minimize the likelihood that tiny, non-detectable tumors exist and will spread (in the inguinal and para-aortic [[lymph nodes]]).  Radiation is ineffective against and is therefore never used as a primary therapy for [[nonseminoma]].

===Chemotherapy===

==== Non-seminoma ====

Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for non-seminoma when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (that is, stage 2B or 3).  The standard [[chemotherapy protocol]] is three, or sometimes four, rounds of [[Bleomycin]]-[[Etoposide]]-[[Cisplatin]] (BEP). BEP as a first-line treatment was first reported by Professor [[Michael Peckham]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Peckham |first1= MJ |last2= Barrett |first2= A | last3= Liew |first3= KH |last4= Horwich |first4= A |last5= Robinson |first5= B| last6= Dobbs |first6= HJ |last7= McElwain|first7= TJ| last8= Hendry|first8= WF|  year= 1983 |title= The treatment of metastatic germ-cell testicular tumours with bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP).|journal= British Journal of Cancer |volume= 47 |pages= 613–619 |pmid= 6189504
|pmc= 2011384 | doi=10.1038/bjc.1983.99 | issue=5}}</ref> The landmark trial published in 1987 which established BEP as the optimum treatment was conducted by Dr. [[Lawrence Einhorn]] at [[Indiana University]].<ref name="Chemotherapy - BEP and EP">{{cite web |url=http://www.tc-library.com/chemotherapy-bep-and-ep/ |title=Chemotherapy - BEP and EP |accessdate=2009-02-16 |work=}}</ref> An alternative, equally effective treatment involves the use of four cycles of [[Etoposide]]-[[Cisplatin]] (EP).

Lymph node surgery may also be performed after chemotherapy to remove masses left behind (stage 2B or more advanced), particularly in the cases of large [[nonseminoma]]s.

==== Seminoma ====

As an [[adjuvant]] treatment, use of [[chemotherapy]] as an alternative to radiation therapy in the treatment of seminoma is increasing, because radiation therapy appears to have more significant long-term side effects (for example, internal scarring, increased risks of secondary malignancies, etc.).  Two doses, or occasionally a single dose of [[carboplatin]], typically delivered three weeks apart, is proving to be a successful [[adjuvant]] treatment, with recurrence rates in the same ranges as those of [[radiotherapy]]. The concept of [[carboplatin]] as a single-dose therapy was developed by Tim Oliver, Professor of Medical Oncology at [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=MRC trial shows single dose of drug is as effective as two weeks' radiotherapy for testicular cancer|url=http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC001863|work=News and Publications|publisher=[[Medical Research Council (UK){{!}}Medical Research Council]]|accessdate=4 December 2011|month=22 July|year=2005}}</ref> However, very long term data on the efficacy of adjuvant carboplatin in this setting do not exist. 

Since seminoma can recur decades after the primary tumor is removed, patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy should remain vigilant and not assume they are cured 5 years after treatment.

==Prognosis==
In the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', treatment of testicular cancer has been called one of the success stories of modern medicine, with sustained response to treatment in more than 90% of cases, regardless of stage.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1056/NEJMbkrev59744 |last= Huang |first= William C. |date= June 5, 2008 |title= Book Review: Urological Oncology |journal= [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume= 358 |issue= 23 |page= 2527 |publisher= Massachusetts Medical Society |issn= 1533-4406 |url= http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMbkrev59744 |accessdate  = August 9, 2010 }}</ref> Because of advances in chemotherapy, cure rates now approach 85% overall, with better than 95% for localized disease and 80% for metastatic disease—the best response by any solid tumor.<ref name=motzerjama />

===Surveillance===
For many patients with stage I cancer, adjuvant (preventative) therapy following surgery may not be appropriate and patients will undergo surveillance instead.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Krege |first=S. |last2=Beyer |first2=J. |last3=Souchon |first3=R. |last4=Albers |first4=P. |last5=Albrecht |first5=W. |last6=Algaba |first6=F. |last7=''et al.'' |title=European consensus conference on diagnosis and treatment of germ cell cancer: a report of the second meeting of the European Germ Cell Cancer Consensus group (EGCCCG): part I |journal=European Urology |year=2008 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=478–496 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2007.12.024 |first7=Michael |last8=Bodrogi |first8=István |last9=Bokemeyer |first9=Carsten |pmid=18191324 }}</ref> The form this surveillance takes, e.g. the type and frequency of investigations and the length time it should continue, will depend on the type of cancer ([[Nonseminoma|non-seminoma]] or [[seminoma]]), but the aim is to avoid unnecessary treatments in the many patients who are cured by their surgery, and ensure that any relapses with [[metastasis|metastases]] (secondary cancers) are detected early and cured. This approach ensures that chemotherapy and or radiotherapy is only given to the patients that need it. The number of patients ultimately cured is the same using surveillance as post-operative “adjuvant” treatments, but the patients have to be prepared to follow a prolonged series of visits and tests.

For both non-seminomas and seminomas, surveillance tests generally include physical examination, blood tests for tumour markers, chest x-rays and [[CT Scan|CT scanning]].  However, the requirements of a surveillance programme differ according to the type of disease since, for seminoma patients, relapses can occur later and blood tests are not as good at indicating relapse.

CT scans are performed on the abdomen (and sometimes the pelvis) and also the chest in some hospitals. Chest x-rays are increasingly preferred for the lungs as they give sufficient detail combined with a lower false-positive rate and significantly smaller radiation dose than CT.

The frequency of CT scans during surveillance should ensure that relapses are detected at an early stage while minimising the radiation exposure.

For patients treated for stage I non-seminoma, a randomised trial ([[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] TE08<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rustin |first=G. J. |last2=Mead |first2=G. M. |last3=Stenning |first3=S. P. |last4=Vasey |first4=P. A. |last5=Aass |first5=N. |last6=Huddart |first6=R.

P. |last8=Joffe |first8=J. K. |last9=Harland |first9=S. J. }}</ref>) showed that, when combined with the standard surveillance tests described above, 2 CT scans at 3 and 12 months were as good as 5 over 2 years in detecting relapse at an early stage.

For patients treated for stage I seminoma who choose surveillance rather than undergoing adjuvant therapy, there have been no randomised trials to determine the optimum frequency of scans and visits, and the schedules vary very widely across the world, and within individual countries. In the UK there is an ongoing clinical trial called TRISST.<ref>{{cite web|title=A trial to find the best way of using scans to monitor men after treatment for seminoma testicular cancer (TRISST MRC TE24)|url=http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/trials/a-trial-to-find-the-best-way-of-using-scans-to-monitor-men-after-treatment-for-seminoma-testicular-cancer|work=CancerHelp UK|publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]]|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Would it be better to use MRI scans instead of CT scans to monitor men with early stage testicular cancer?

MRI is being investigated because it does not expose the patient to radiation and so, if it is shown to be as good at detecting relapses, it may be preferable to CT. It is possible that one or more centres in Canada may join the trial in the next year or so.

For more advanced stages of testicular cancer, and for those cases in which radiation therapy or chemotherapy was administered, the extent of monitoring (tests) after treatment will vary on the basis of the circumstances, but normally should be done for five years in uncomplicated cases and for longer in those with higher risks of relapse.

===Fertility===
A man with one remaining testis can lead a normal life, because the remaining testis takes up the burden of [[testosterone]] production and will generally have adequate fertility.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/196_test.html {{Dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> However, it is worth the (minor) expense of measuring hormone levels before removal of a testicle, and sperm banking may be appropriate for younger men who still plan to have children, since fertility may be lessened by removal of one testicle{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, and can be severely affected if extensive [[chemotherapy]] and/or [[radiotherapy]] is done.

Less than five percent of those who have testicular cancer will have it again in the remaining testis.  A man who [[castration|loses both testicles]] will normally have to take hormone supplements (in particular, [[testosterone]], which is created in the testicles), and will be infertile, but can lead an otherwise normal life.

==Epidemiology==
Testicular cancer is most common among Caucasian men and rare among men of African descent.<ref name="titleCancer of the testicle Causes - Health encyclopaedia - NHS Direct">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=85&sectionId=5 |title=Cancer of the testicle Causes - Health encyclopaedia - NHS Direct |accessdate=2007-12-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071210081436/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=85&sectionId=5 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-10}}</ref> Testicular cancer is uncommon in Asia and Africa. Worldwide incidence has doubled since the 1960s, with the highest rates of prevalence in [[Scandinavia]], [[Germany]], and [[New Zealand]].

Higher rates of testicular cancer in western nations have been linked to use of cannabis. A study conducted by the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] and funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]], published in the journal ''[[Cancer (journal)|Cancer]]'' March 15, 2009, linked long term use of cannabis to an increased risk for testicular cancer with the scientists concluding that cannabis is harmful to the human endocrine and reproductive system.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090209075631.htm|title=Marijuana Use Linked To Increased Risk Of Testicular Cancer|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |doi=|date=2009-03-15|accessdate=|last1=Daling|first1=Janet|last2=Swartz|first2=Stephen|journal=Cancer}}</ref><ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/138372.php Testicular Cancer Risk Linked To Marijuana Smoking ] Medical News Today 02-09-2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/cannabis-linked-to-testicular-cancer-1604487.html Cannabis linked to testicular cancer ].

Incidence among African Americans doubled from 1988 to 2001 with a bias towards [[germinoma|seminoma]]. The lack of significant increase in the incidence of early-stage testicular cancer during this timeframe suggests that the overall increase was not due to heightened awareness of the disease.

Although testicular cancer is most common among men aged 15–40 years, it has three peaks: infancy through the age of four as [[teratoma]]s and [[yolk sac tumor]]s, ages 25–40 years as post-pubertal seminomas and nonseminomas, and from age 60 as spermatocytic seminomas.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Leendert H.

A major risk factor for the development of testis cancer is [[cryptorchidism]] (undescended testicles).  It is generally believed that the presence of a tumor contributes to cryptorchidism;  when cryptorchidism occurs in conjunction with a tumor then the tumor tends to be large.  Other risk factors include [[inguinal hernia]]s, [[Klinefelter syndrome]], and <ref>{{cite journal

==In other animals==
Testicular tumors occur also in animals.  In [[horse]]s, these include [[interstitial cell tumor]]s and teratomas.  Typically, the former are found in older [[stallion]]s (affected stallions may become extremely vicious, suggesting excessive production of [[androgen]]), and the latter are found in young horses and are large.<ref>{{cite book
