'''Pharyngitis'''  ({{IPAc-en|icon|f|ær|ɨ|n|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|t|ɨ|s}}) comes from the [[Classical language|Greek word]] [[pharynx]] ''pharanx'' meaning [[throat]] and the suffix -itis meaning inflammation.  It is an [[inflammation]] of the throat.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|dorland/six|pharyngitis}}</ref> In most cases it is quite painful, and is the most common cause of a [[sore throat]].<ref name="Rosen2010"/>

Like many types of inflammation, pharyngitis can be [[acute (medicine)|acute]]&nbsp;– characterized by a rapid onset and typically a relatively short course&nbsp;– or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]]. Pharyngitis can result in very large [[tonsils]] which cause trouble swallowing and breathing. Pharyngitis can be accompanied by a [[cough]] or [[fever]], for example, if caused by a [[systemic infection]].

Most acute cases are caused by [[virus|viral]] infections (40–80%), with the remainder caused by [[bacteria]]l infections,  [[fungus|fungal]] infections, or irritants such as [[pollutant]]s or [[chemical substance]]s.<ref name="Rosen2010"/><ref name="Acerra">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/764304-overview |title=Pharyngitis |author=Acerra JR |work=eMedicine |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Treatment of viral causes are mainly symptomatic while bacterial or fungal causes may be amenable to [[antibiotics]] and [[anti-fungal]] respectively.

==Classification==
Pharyngitis is a type of inflammation, most commonly caused by an [[upper respiratory tract infection]]. It may be classified as acute or chronic. An acute pharyngitis may be catarrhal, purulent or ulcerative, depending on the virulence of the causative agent and the immune capacity of the affected individual. Chronic pharyngitis is the most common otolaringologic disease and may be catarrhal, hypertrophic or atrophic.

If the inflammation includes [[tonsillitis]], it is called pharyngotonsillitis.<ref name=Ped2006>{{cite journal |author=Rafei K, Lichenstein R |hi
|journal=Pediatr. Clin. North Am. |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=215–42 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16574523 |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2005.10.001 |url=}}</ref> Another sub classification is [[nasopharyngitis]] (the common cold).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2010/MB_cgi?field=uid&term=D014069 |title=www.nlm.nih.gov |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Cause==
The majority of cases are due to an infectious organism acquired from close contact with an infected individual.

===Infectious===
;Viral
These comprise about 40–80% of all infectious cases and can be a feature of many different types of viral infections.<ref name=Rosen2010>{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice |edition=7th |last=Marx |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |at=Chapter 30 |url= }}</ref><ref name="Acerra"/>
*[[Adenovirus]] – the most common of the viral causes. Typically the degree of neck [[lymph node]] enlargement is modest and the throat often does not appear red, although it is very painful.
*[[Orthomyxoviridae]] which cause [[influenza]] – present with rapid onset high temperature, headache and generalised ache. A sore throat may be associated.
*[[Infectious mononucleosis]] ("glandular fever") caused by the [[Epstein-Barr virus]]. This may cause significant lymph gland swelling and an [[exudative]] tonsillitis with marked redness and swelling of the throat. The [[heterophile test]] can be used if this is suspected.
*[[Herpes simplex virus]] can cause multiple [[mouth ulcers]].
*[[Measles]]
*[[Common cold]]: [[rhinovirus]], [[coronavirus]], [[respiratory syncytial virus]], [[parainfluenza virus]] can cause infection of the throat, ear, and lungs causing standard cold-like symptoms and often extreme pain.

;Bacterial
A number of different bacteria can infect the human throat.  The most common is [[Group A streptococcus]], however others include ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'', ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila pneumoniae]]'', and ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]''.<ref name=NEJM2001>{{cite journal |author=Bisno AL |title=Acute pharyngitis |journal=[[N Engl J Med]] |volume=344 |issue=3 |pages=205–11 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11172144 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM200101183440308 }}</ref>

;;Streptococcal pharyngitis
[[File:Pos strep.JPG|thumb|A case of strep throat]]
[[Streptococcal pharyngitis]] or strep throat is caused by [[group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus]] (GAS).<ref name=Review10>{{cite journal |author=Baltimore RS |title=Re-evaluation of antibiotic treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis |journal=Curr. Opin. Pediatr. |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=77–82 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=19996970 |doi=10.1097/MOP.0b013e32833502e7 |url=}}</ref>  It is the most common bacterial cause of cases of pharyngitis (15–30%).<ref name=NEJM2001/> Common symptoms include [[fever]], [[sore throat]], and large [[lymph nodes]].  It is a contagious infection, spread by close contact with an infected individual.  A definitive diagnosis is made based on the results of a throat culture.  [[Antibiotics]] are useful to both prevent complications and speed recovery.<ref name=Review09>{{cite journal |author=Choby BA |title=Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=383–90 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19275067 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

;;Fusobacterium necrophorum
''[[Fusobacterium necrophorum]]'' are normal inhabitants of the oropharyngeal flora. Occasionally however it can create a [[peritonsillar abscess]].  In 1 out of 400 untreated cases [[Lemierre's syndrome]] occurs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Centor RM |title=Expand the pharyngitis paradigm for adolescents and young adults |journal=[[Ann Intern Med]] |volume=151 |issue=11 |date=2009-12-01 |pages=812–5 |pmid=19949147 |doi= 10.1059/0003-4819-151-11-200912010-00011}}</ref>

;;Diphtheria
[[Diphtheria]] is a potentially life threatening upper respiratory infection caused by ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'' which has been largely eradicated in developed nations since the introduction of childhood [[vaccination]] programs, but is still reported in the [[Third World]] and increasingly in some areas in [[Eastern Europe]]. Antibiotics are effective in the early stages, but recovery is generally slow.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

;;Others
A few other causes are rare, but possibly fatal, and include parapharyngeal space infections: [[peritonsillar abscess]] ("quinsy"), [[submandibular space infection]] (Ludwig's angina), and [[epiglottitis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=pc_id/4421&selectedTitle=1~150&source=search_result |title=UpToDate Inc. |work= |accessdate=}} (registration required)</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Reynolds SC, Chow AW |title=Severe soft tissue infections of the head and neck: a primer for critical care physicians |journal=[[Lung (journal)|Lung]] |date=2009 Sep-Oct |volume=187 |issue=5 |pages=271–9 |pmid=19653038 |doi=10.1007/s00408-009-9153-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bansal A, Miskoff J, Lis RJ |title=Otolaryngologic critical care|journal=[[Crit Care Clin]] |date=2003 Jan |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=55–72 |pmid=12688577 |doi=10.1016/S0749-0704(02)00062-3}}</ref>

;Fungal
Some cases of pharyngitis are caused by [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]] such as [[Candida albicans]] causing [[Oral candidiasis|oral thrush]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

=== Non-infectious ===
Pharyngitis may also be caused by mechanical, chemical or thermal irritation, for example cold air or [[acid reflux]]. Some medications may produce pharyngitis such as [[pramipexole]] and [[antipsychotic]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bidocs.boehringer-ingelheim.com/BIWebAccess/ViewServlet.ser?docBase=renetnt&folderPath=/Prescribing+Information/PIs/Mirapex/Mirapex.pdf |title=Mirapex product insert  |author= |year=2009 |format=PDF |work= |publisher=Boehringer Ingelheim |pages= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/olanzapine |title=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition  |author= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=Elsevier |pages= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>

It is hard to differentiate a viral and a bacterial cause of a sore throat based on symptoms alone.<ref name=IDSA2012/> Thus often a throat swab is done to rule out a bacterial cause.<ref name="pmid1565052">{{cite journal |author=Del Mar C |title=Managing sore throat: a literature review. I. Making the diagnosis |journal=[[Med J Aust]] |volume=156 |issue=8 |pages=572–5 |year=1992 |pmid=1565052 |doi=}}</ref>

The modified [[Centor criteria]] may be used to determine the management of people with pharyngitis. Based on 5 clinical criteria, it indicates the probability of a streptococcal infection.<ref name=Review09/>

One point is given for each of the criteria:<ref name=Review09>{{cite journal |author = Choby BA | title = Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 79 | issue = 5 | pages = 383–90 | year = 2009 | month = March | pmid = 19275067 | doi =  | url =http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0301/p383.html }}</ref>
*Absence of a cough
*Swollen and tender cervical lymph nodes
*Temperature >{{convert|38.0|C|F}}
*Tonsillar exudate or swelling
*Age less than 15 (a point is subtracted if age >44)

The McIsaac criteria adds to the Centor:<ref name="pmid22566485">{{cite journal| author=Fine AM, Nizet V, Mandl KD| title=Large-Scale Validation of the Centor and McIsaac Scores to Predict Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis. | journal=Arch Intern Med | year= 2012 | volume=  | issue=  | pages=  | pmid=22566485 | doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2012.950 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=22566485  }} </ref>
* Age less than 15: add one point
* Age greater than 45: subtract one point

The [[Infectious Disease Society of America]] however recommends against empirical treatment and considers antibiotics only appropriate following positive testing.<ref name=IDSA2012/> Testing is not needed in children under three as both group A strep and [[rheumatic fever]] are rare, except if they have a sibling with the disease.<ref name=IDSA2012>{{cite journal|last=Shulman|first=ST|coauthors=Bisno, AL; Clegg, HW; Gerber, MA; Kaplan, EL; Lee, G; Martin, JM; Van Beneden, C|title=Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis: 2012 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.|journal=Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America|date=2012 Sep 9|pmid=22965026}}</ref>

==Management==
The majority of time treatment is symptomatic.  Specific treatments are effective for bacterial, fungal, and herpes simplex infections.

===Medications===
* [[Analgesics]] such as [[NSAIDs]] and [[acetaminophen]] can help reduce the pain associated with a sore throat. (Note: Don't use salicylates, like aspirin, for influenza: Increased risk of [[Reye's syndrome]])<ref name=Thomas>{{cite journal |author=Thomas M, Del Mar C, Glasziou P |title=How effective are treatments other than antibiotics for acute sore throat? |journal=[[Br J Gen Pract]] |volume=50 |issue=459 |pages=817–20 |year=2000 |month=October |pmid=11127175 |pmc=1313826 |doi= }}</ref>
* [[Steroid]]s (such as [[dexamethasone]]) have been found to be useful for severe pharyngitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hayward G, Thompson M, Heneghan C, Perera R, Del Mar C, Glasziou P |title=Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=339 |issue= |pages=b2976 |year=2009 |pmid=19661138 |pmc=2722696 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.b2976|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=740 |title=Do steroids reduce symptoms in acute pharyngitis? |publisher=BestBets.org |accessdate=2009-01-14}}</ref>
*  Viscous [[lidocaine]] relieves pain by numbing the mucus membranes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/lidocaine_viscous/article.htm |title=LIDOCAINE VISCOUS (Xylocaine Viscous) side effects, medical uses, and drug interactions. |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>
* [[Antibiotic]]s are useful if a bacterial infection is the cause of the sore throat. For viral infections, antibiotics have no effect.<ref name="pharyngitis-cochrane">{{cite journal |author=Del Mar CB, Glasziou PP, Spinks AB |title=Antibiotics for sore throat |journal=[[Cochrane Library|Cochrane Database Syst Rev]] |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000023 |year=2004 |pmid=15106140 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000023.pub2 |editor1-last=Del Mar |editor1-first=Chris}} - Meta-analysis of published research</ref>
* Oral analgesic solutions, the active ingredient usually being [[Phenol]], but also less commonly [[Benzocaine]], [[Cetylpyridinium chloride]] and/or [[Menthol]]. [[Chloraseptic]] and [[Cēpacol]] are two examples of brands of these kinds of analgesics.
