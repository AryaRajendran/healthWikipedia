'''Histrionic personality disorder''' ('''HPD''') is defined by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] as a [[personality disorder]] characterized by a pattern of excessive emotionality and [[attention-seeking]], including an excessive need for approval and inappropriately [[seduction|seductive]] behavior, usually beginning in early adulthood. These individuals are lively, dramatic, vivacious, enthusiastic, and [[flirtatious]]. HPD affects four times as many women as men.<ref name=seligman /> It has a [[prevalence]] of 2–3% in the general population, and 10–15% in inpatient and outpatient mental health institutions.<ref name=dsmiv>{{cite book|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=22&sectionid=1892638#4017|chapter=Chapter 16: Personality Disorders|title=DSM-IV-TR Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=2000}}</ref>

HPD lies in the dramatic cluster of personality disorders.<ref name="WebMD" /> People with HPD have a high need for attention, make loud and inappropriate appearances, [[exaggerate]] their behaviors and emotions, and crave stimulation.<ref name=WebMD /> They may exhibit sexually provocative behavior, express strong emotions with an impressionistic style, and can be easily influenced by others. Associated features include [[egocentrism]], [[self-indulgence]], continuous longing for appreciation, and persistent [[psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behavior to achieve their own needs.

==Characteristics==
People with HPD are usually high-functioning, both socially and professionally. They usually have good [[social skills]], despite tending to use them to manipulate others into making them the center of attention.<ref name=Cleveland>{{cite web | publisher=The Cleveland Clinic | title =Histrionic Personality Disorder | url=http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/health-info/docs/3700/3795.asp?index=9743 | accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> HPD may also affect a person's social and/or [[romance (love)|romantic]] relationships, plus their abilities to cope with losses or failures. They may seek treatment for [[Clinical depression]] when romantic (or, other close personal) relationships end.

Individuals with HPD often fail to see their own personal situation realistically, instead dramatizing and exaggerating their difficulties. They may go through frequent job changes, as they become easily bored and may prefer withdrawing from [[frustration]] (instead of facing it). Because they tend to crave [[novelty]] and excitement, they may place themselves in risky situations. All of these factors may lead to greater risk of developing clinical depression.<ref name=ADAM>{{cite web | title=Histrionic personality disorder | publisher=PubMed Health | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002498/ %7C accessdate 17 June 2012}}</ref>
Additional characteristics may include:
* [[Exhibitionist]] behavior
* Constant seeking of reassurance or approval
* Excessive sensitivity to [[criticism]] or disapproval
* Pride of own personality and unwillingness to change, viewing any change as a threat
* Inappropriately [[seductive]] appearance or behavior of a sexual nature
* Using somatic symptoms (of physical illness) to garner attention
* A need to be the center of [[attention seeking|attention]]
* Low tolerance for frustration or [[delayed gratification]]
* Rapidly shifting emotional states that may appear superficial or exaggerated to others
* Tendency to believe that relationships are more intimate than they actually are
* Making rash decisions<ref name=Cleveland />
* Blaming personal failures or disappointments on others
* Being easily influenced by others, especially those who treat them approvingly
* Being overly dramatic and emotional<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002498/</ref>

Some histrionics change their seduction technique into a more maternal/paternal style as they age.<ref name="AMN"/>

===Mnemonic===
A [[mnemonic]] that can be used to remember the characteristics of histrionic personality disorder is "PRAISE ME":<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pinkofsky|first=HB|title=Mnemonics for DSM-IV personality disorders|journal=Psychiatric services|location=Washington, D.C.|year=1997|month=September|volume=48|issue=9|pages=1197–8|pmid=9285984}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Personality Disorders|url=http://www.personalityresearch.org/pd.html|date=March 2001|accessdate=2 May 2, 2006}}</ref>
* '''P'''rovocative (or seductive) behavior
* '''R'''elationships are considered more intimate than they actually are
* '''A'''ttention-seeking
* '''I'''nfluenced easily
* '''S'''peech (style) wants to impress; lacks detail
* [[Labile affect|'''E'''motional lability]]; shallowness
* '''M'''ake-up; physical appearance is used to draw attention to self
* '''E'''xaggerated emotions; theatrical

==Causes==
The cause of histrionic personality disorder is unknown, but childhood events such as deaths or illnesses in the immediate family (which present constant anxiety), divorce of parents, and [[genetics]] may be involved. HPD is more often diagnosed in women than men; men with some similar symptoms are often diagnosed with [[narcissistic personality disorder]].<ref name=seligman>{{cite book
 | last = Seligman | first = Martin E.P.
 | title=Abnormal Psychology | publisher=W. W. Norton & Company| year=1984 | chapter=Chapter 11 | isbn=0-393-94459-X}}</ref>

Little research has been conducted to determine the biological sources, if any, of this disorder. [[psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] theories incriminate [[Authoritarian Parent|authoritarian]] or distant attitudes by one (mainly the mother) or both of parents, along with conditional love based on expectations the child can never fully meet.<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web | last =Bienenfeld|first=David| publisher=WebMD | title =Personality Disorders | url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3472.htm | year = 2006 |work=Medscape Reference| accessdate=10 January 2007}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The person's appearance, behavior, and history, along with a [[psychological evaluation]], are usually sufficient to establish a diagnosis. There is no test to confirm this diagnosis. Because the criteria are subjective, some people may be wrongly diagnosed.<ref name=psych-central />

===DSM-IV-TR===
The most recent edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], DSM IV-TR, defines histrionic personality disorder (in [[Personality disorder#Cluster B (dramatic, emotional or erratic disorders)|Cluster B]]) as:<ref name=dsmiv />
{{quote|A pervasive pattern of excessive [[emotionality]] and attention-seeking, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:
* is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of attention
* interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior
* displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions
* consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self
* has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail
* shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and [[exaggerated]] expression of emotion
* is suggestible, i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances
* considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are}}

The DSM-IV requires that a diagnosis for any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of [[Personality disorder#Diagnosis|general personality disorder criteria]].

===ICD-10===
The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-10]] lists histrionic personality disorder as:<ref name="icd10">{{cite book|title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10)|year=2010|chapter=Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders (F00-F99)|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F60.4|publisher=World Health Organization}}
({{ICD10|F|60|4|f|60}})</ref>{{quote|[A] personality disorder characterized by:
* shallow and labile affectivity,
* self-dramatization,
* theatricality,
* exaggerated expression of emotions,
* suggestibility,
* egocentricity,
* self-indulgence,
* lack of consideration for others,
* easily hurt feelings, and
* continuous seeking for appreciation, excitement and attention.}}

It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of [[Personality disorder#General diagnostic criteria 2|general personality disorder criteria]].

===Comorbidity===
Most histrionics also have other mental disorders. Comorbid conditions include: [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], and [[narcissistic personality disorder]]s,<ref name=Hales>Hales E and Yudofsky JA, eds, The American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Psychiatry, Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., 2003</ref> as well as [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]],{{cn|date=April 2013}} [[anxiety disorders]], [[panic disorder]], [[somatoform disorders]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[substance use disorder]]<ref>[http://www.health.am/psy/histrionic-personality-disorder/ Armenian Medical Network]</ref> and [[attachment disorder]]s, including [[reactive attachment disorder]].{{cn|date=April 2013}}

===Millon's subtypes===
[[Theodore Millon]] identified six subtypes of histrionic personality disorder. Any individual histrionic may exhibit none or one of the following:<ref name="Millon">Millon, Theodore (2004).

==Treatment==
Treatment is often prompted by depression associated with dissolved romantic relationships. Medication does little to affect the personality disorder, but may be helpful with symptoms such as depression.<ref name=psych-central>{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/disorders/sx17t.htm#psych |title=Psych Central: Histrionic Personality Disorder Treatment|publisher=Psych Central}}</ref> Treatment for HPD itself involves [[psychotherapy]], including [[cognitive therapy]].<ref name=WebMD />

==Epidemiology==
