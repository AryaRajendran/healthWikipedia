'''Brain herniation''' is a deadly side effect of very high [[intracranial pressure]] that occurs when a part of the [[human brain|brain]] is squeezed across structures within the [[human skull|skull]]. The brain can shift across such structures as the [[falx cerebri]], the [[tentorium cerebelli]], and even through the [[foramen magnum]] in the base of the skull (through which the [[spinal cord]] connects with the brain).  Herniation can be caused by a number of factors that cause a [[mass effect (medicine)|mass effect]] and increase [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP): these include [[traumatic brain injury]], [[intracranial hemorrhage]], or [[brain tumor]].<ref name="Barr07">{{cite book |author= Barr RM, Gean AD, Le TH |editor=Brant WE, Helms CA |chapter=Craniofacial trauma |title=Fundamentals of Diagnostic Radiology |publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2007 |isbn=0-7817-6135-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-11-17 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Sossht2t5XwC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=extra-axial+intra-axial |page= 69}}</ref>  

Herniation can also occur in the absence of high ICP when mass lesions such as hematomas occur at the borders of brain compartments. In such cases local pressure is increased at the place where the herniation occurs, but this pressure is not transmitted to the rest of the brain, and therefore does not register as an increase in ICP.<ref name="Gruen02">{{cite journal |author=Gruen P |title=Surgical management of head trauma |journal=Neuroimaging Clinics of North America |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=339â€“43 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=12391640 |doi=10.1016/S1052-5149(02)00013-8 }}</ref>

Because herniation puts extreme pressure on parts of the brain and thereby cuts off the blood supply to various parts of the brain, it is often fatal. Therefore, extreme measures are taken in hospital settings to prevent the condition by reducing [[intracranial pressure]], or decompressing (draining) a hematoma which is putting local pressure on a part of the brain.

There are two major classes of herniation: supratentorial and infratentorial. Supratentorial herniation is of structures normally above the tentorial notch and infratentorial is of structures normally below it.<ref name="Orlando Regional">Orlando Regional Healthcare, Education and Development. 2004.

===Uncal herniation===
In uncal herniation, a common subtype of transtentorial herniation, the innermost part of the [[temporal lobe]], the [[uncus]], can be squeezed so much that it moves towards the [[tentorium cerebelli|tentorium]] and puts pressure on the [[brainstem]], most notably the midbrain.<ref name="Shepherd">Shepherd S. 2004. [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2820.htm "Head trauma."] Emedicine.com.  Retrieved on January 28, 2007.</ref> The tentorium is a structure within the [[human skull|skull]] formed by the dura mater of the meninges.  Tissue may be stripped from the [[cerebral cortex]] in a process called [[decortication]].<ref name="McCaffrey">McCaffrey P. 2001.  [http://www.csuchico.edu/~pmccaff/syllabi/SPPA336/336unit11.html "The neuroscience on the web series: CMSD 336 neuropathologies of language and cognition."] California State University, Chico. Retrieved on August 7, 2007. </ref>

The uncus can squeeze the [[third cranial nerve]], which may affect the [[parasympathetic]] input to the [[human eye|eye]] on the side of the affected nerve, causing the [[pupil (eye)|pupil]] of the affected eye to [[Pupillary dilation|dilate]] and fail to constrict in response to light as it should. Pupillary dilation often precedes the somatic motor effects of cranial nerve III compression, which present as deviation of the eye to a "down and out" position due to loss of innervation to all [[ocular muscles|ocular motility muscles]] except for the lateral rectus (innervated by cranial nerve VI) and the superior oblique (innervated by cranial nerve IV). The symptoms occur in this order because the parasympathetic fibers surround the motor fibers of CNIII and are hence compressed first.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Compression of the ipsilateral [[posterior cerebral artery]] will result in ischemia of the ipsilateral primary visual cortex and contralateral visual field deficits in both eyes (contralateral [[homonymous hemianopsia]]).

Another important finding is a ''false localizing sign'', the so called [[Kernohan's notch]], which results from compression of the [[contralateral]] [[cerebral crus]] containing descending [[corticospinal tract|corticospinal]] and some [[corticobulbar tract|corticobulbar]] tract fibers. This leads to [[ipsilateral]] (same side as mass) [[hemiparesis]] (as these tracts are above their decussation where they are compressed). Since the corticospinal tract predominately innervates flexor muscles, extension of the leg may also be seen. With increasing pressure and progression of the hernia there will be distortion of the brainstem leading to [[Duret hemorrhage]]s (tearing of small vessels in the [[parenchyma]]) in the median and paramedian zones of the [[mesencephalon]] and [[pons]]. The rupture of these vessels leads to linear or flamed shaped hemorrhages. The disrupted brainstem can lead to [[decorticate posture]], respiratory center depression and death. Other possibilities resulting from brain stem distortion include [[lethargy]], slow heart rate, and [[mydriasis|pupil dilation]].<ref name="McCaffrey"/>  Uncal herniation may advance to central herniation.<ref name="Orlando Regional"/>

A complication of an uncal herniation is a Duret hemorrhage. This results in the midbrain and pons being compressed, possibly causing damage to the [[reticular formation]]. If untreated, death will ensue.

===Central herniation===
In ''central herniation'', the [[diencephalon]] and parts of the [[temporal lobes]] of both of the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s are squeezed through a notch in the [[tentorium cerebelli]].<ref name="Shepherd"/><ref name="Cornell">Cornell. 1998.  Introduction to neuropathology. Reaction to injury: Brain histology." Cornell University Medical College. </ref>  Transtentorial herniation can occur when the brain moves either up or down across the tentorium, called ascending and descending transtentorial herniation respectively; however descending herniation is much more common.<ref name="Barr07"/>  Downward herniation can stretch branches of the [[basilar artery]] (pontine arteries), causing them to tear and bleed, known as a [[Duret hemorrhage]]. The result is usually fatal.<ref name="Cornell"/> Radiographically, downward herniation is characterized by obliteration of the [[suprasellar cistern]] from temporal lobe herniation into the tentorial hiatus with associated compression on the cerebral peduncles.  Upwards herniation, on the other hand, can be radiographically characterized by obliteration of the quadrigeminal cistern. Intracranial hypotension syndrome has been known to mimic downwards transtentorial herniation.

===Cingulate herniation===
[[File:Subfalcine-herniation-001.jpg|thumb|Subfalcine herniation on CT]]
In ''cingulate'' or ''subfalcine herniation'', the most common type, the innermost part of the [[frontal lobe]] is scraped under part of the [[falx cerebri]], the dura mater at the top of the head between the two [[brain hemisphere|hemispheres of the brain]].<ref name="Shepherd"/><ref name="dawodu">Dawodu ST. 2007. [http://www.emedicine.com/pmr/topic212.htm Traumatic brain injury: Definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology.] Emedicine.com. Retrieved on January 28, 2007.</ref> Cingulate herniation can be caused when one hemisphere swells and pushes the [[cingulate gyrus]] by the falx cerebri.<ref name="Orlando Regional"/> This does not put as much pressure on the brainstem as the other types of herniation, but it may interfere with [[blood vessel]]s in the frontal lobes that are close to the site of injury (anterior cerebral artery), or it may progress to central herniation.<ref name="Shepherd"/>  Interference with the blood supply can cause dangerous increases in ICP that can lead to more dangerous forms of herniation.<ref name="hudson">Kristi Hudson.  2006. [http://dynamicnursingeducation.com/class.php?class_id=37 Brain Herniation Syndromes - 2 Nursing CEs.] Dynamic Nursing Education.  Retrieved on September 6, 2007.</ref>  Symptoms for cingulate herniation are not well defined.<ref name="hudson"/>  Usually occurring in addition to uncal herniation, cingulate herniation may present with [[abnormal posturing]] and [[coma]].<ref name="Orlando Regional"/>  Cingulate herniation is frequently believed to be a precursor to other types of herniation.<ref name="hudson"/>

===Transcalvarial herniation===
In ''transcalvarial herniation'', the brain squeezes through a fracture or a surgical site in the skull.<ref name="Orlando Regional"/> Also called "external herniation", this type of herniation may occur during [[craniectomy]], surgery in which a flap of skull is removed, preventing the piece of skull from being replaced.<ref name="Barr07"/>

===Upward herniation===
Increased pressure in the posterior [[Posterior cranial fossa|fossa]] can cause the [[cerebellum]] to move up through the tentorial opening in ''upward'', or ''cerebellar herniation''.<ref name="Shepherd"/>  The [[midbrain]] is pushed through the tentorial notch. This also pushes the midbrain down.

==={{anchor|coning}}Tonsillar herniation===
In ''tonsillar herniation'', also called ''downward cerebellar herniation'',<ref name="Orlando Regional"/> or "coning", the cerebellar tonsils move downward through the [[foramen magnum]] possibly causing compression of the lower brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord as they pass through the foramen magnum.<ref name="Shepherd"/> Increased pressure on the brainstem can result in dysfunction of the centers in the brain responsible for controlling respiratory and cardiac function.

Tonsillar herniation of the [[cerebellum]] is also known as a [[Chiari Malformation]] (CM),  or previously an Arnold Chiari Malformation (ACM).  There are at least three types of Chiari malformation that are widely recognized, and they represent very different disease processes with different symptoms and prognosis.  These conditions can be found in asymptomatic patients as an incidental finding, or can be so severe as to be life-threatening.  This condition is now being diagnosed more frequently by radiologists, as more and more patients undergo MRI scans of their heads.  Cerebellar ectopia is a term used by radiologists to describe cerebellar tonsils that are "low lying" but that do not meet the radiographic criteria for definition as a Chiari malformation.  The currently accepted radiographic definition for a Chiari malformation is that cerebellar tonsils lie at least 5mm below the level of the foramen magnum.  Some  clinicians have reported that some patients appear to experience symptoms consistent with a Chiari malformation without radiographic evidence of tonsillar herniation.  Sometimes these patients are described as having a 'Chiari [type] 0'.

There are many suspected causes of tonsillar herniation including: decreased or malformed posterior fossa (the lower, back part of the skull) not providing enough room for the cerebellum; hydrocephalus or abnormal CSF volume pushing the tonsils out. Connective tissue disorders, such as [[Ehlers Danlos Syndrome]], can be associated. 

For further evaluation of tonsillar herniation, CINE flow studies are used. This type of MRI examines flow of CSF at the cranio-cervical joint.  For persons experiencing symptoms with seemingly Max herniation, especially if the symptoms are better in the supine position and worse upon standing/upright, an upright MRI may be useful.<ref name="Gruen02"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Decorticate.PNG|thumb|450px|right|Decorticate posturing, with elbows, wrists and fingers flexed, and legs extended and rotated inward]]
Brain herniation frequently presents with [[abnormal posturing]]<ref name="Gruen02"/> a characteristic positioning of the limbs indicative of severe brain damage.  These patients have a lowered [[Altered level of consciousness|level of consciousness]], with [[Glasgow Coma Score]]s of three to five.<ref name="Gruen02"/> One or both pupils may be dilated and fail to constrict in response to light.<ref name="Gruen02"/> Vomiting can also occur due to compression of the [[vomiting center]] in the [[medulla oblongata]].

==Treatment and prognosis==
[[Image:Brain injury with herniation MRI.jpg|thumb|right|MRI showing damage due to herniation. This patient was left with residual disabilities including those involving movement and speech.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rapid progression of traumatic bifrontal contusions to transtentorial herniation: A case report |journal=Cases journal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=203 |year=2008 |pmid=18831756 |pmc=2566562 |doi=10.1186/1757-1626-1-203 |url= http://www.casesjournal.com/content/1/1/203 |author1=Rehman T |author2=Ali R |author3=Tawil I |author4=Yonas H |author-separator=,}}</ref>]]

Treatment involves removal of the etiologic mass and [[decompressive craniectomy]]. Brain herniation can cause severe disability or death. In fact, when herniation is visible on a [[CT scan]], the prognosis for a meaningful recovery of neurological function is poor.<ref name="Gruen02"/> The patient may become paralyzed on the same side as the lesion causing the pressure, or damage to parts of the brain caused by herniation may cause paralysis on the side opposite the lesion.<ref name="Cornell"/> Damage to the [[midbrain]], which contains the [[reticular activating network]] which regulates [[consciousness]], will result in [[coma]].<ref name="Cornell"/> Damage to the cardio-respiratory centers in the [[medulla oblongata]] will cause [[respiratory arrest]] and (secondarily) [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name="Cornell"/> Current{{When|date=October 2012}} investigation is underway regarding the use of neuroprotective agents during the prolonged post-traumatic period of brain hypersensitivity associated with the syndrome.
