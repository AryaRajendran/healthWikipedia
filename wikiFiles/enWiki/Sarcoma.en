A '''sarcoma''' (from the Greek ''sarx'' (σάρκα) meaning "flesh") is a [[cancer]] that arises from transformed [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of [[mesenchyma|mesenchymal]] origin. Thus, [[malignant tumor]]s made of cancerous [[bone]], [[cartilage]], [[fat]], [[muscle]], [[vascular]], or [[hematopoietic]] tissues are, by definition, considered sarcomas. This is in contrast to a malignant tumor originating from [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells, which are termed [[carcinoma]]. Human sarcomas are quite rare.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement is sorely lacking in specificity, and, without citation, is otherwise unjustified|date=March 2013}} Common malignancies, such as [[Breast cancer|breast]], [[Colon cancer|colon]], and [[Lung cancer|lung]] cancer, are almost always carcinoma.

===Tissue===
Sarcomas are given a number of different names based on the type of tissue from which they arise.  For example, [[osteosarcoma]] arises from [[bone]], [[chondrosarcoma]] arises from [[cartilage]], [[liposarcoma]] arises from [[fat]], and [[leiomyosarcoma]] arises from [[smooth muscle]].

===Grade===
In addition to being named based on the tissue of origin, sarcomas are also assigned a grade (low, intermediate, or high) based on the presence and frequency of certain cellular and subcellular characteristics associated with malignant biological behavior. Low grade sarcomas are usually treated surgically, although sometimes [[radiation therapy]] or [[chemotherapy]] are used. Intermediate and high grade sarcomas are more frequently treated with a combination of [[surgery]], [[chemotherapy]] and/or [[radiation therapy]].<ref name=Buecker05>{{cite journal |author=Buecker, P |title=Sarcoma: A Diagnosis of Patience |journal=ESUN |volume=2 |issue=5 |year=2005 |url=http://sarcomahelp.org/articles/patience.html | accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref>  Since higher grade tumors are more likely to undergo [[metastasis]] (invasion and spread to locoregional and distant sites), they are treated more aggressively.  The recognition that many sarcomas are sensitive to chemotherapy has dramatically improved the survival of patients. For example, in the era before chemotherapy, long term survival for patients with localized osteosarcoma was only approximately 20%, but now has risen to 60–70%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Longhi A, Errani C, De Paolis M, Mercuri M, Bacci G |title=Primary bone osteosarcoma in the pediatric age: state of the art |journal=Cancer Treat Rev. |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=423–36 |year=2006 |month=Oct |pmid=16860938 |doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2006.05.005 |url=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Surgery is important in the treatment of most sarcomas.<ref name=Morris05>{{cite journal |author=Morris, C |title=
Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma (MFH) |journal=ESUN |volume=2 |issue=2 |year=2005 |url=http://sarcomahelp.org/mfh.html| accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref> Limb sparing surgery, as opposed to amputation, can now be used to save the limbs of patients in at least 90% of extremity tumor cases.<ref name=Morris05/> Additional treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, may be administered before and/or after surgery.<ref name=Buecker05/> Chemotherapy significantly improves the prognosis for many sarcoma patients, especially those with bone sarcomas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baker, L |title=

*[[Liposarcoma]] treatment consists of surgical resection, with chemotherapy not being used outside of the investigative setting. Adjuvant radiotherapy may also be used after surgical excision for liposarcoma.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1102007|Liposarcoma Treatment & Management|treatment}}</ref>
*Rhabdomyosarcoma is treated with [[surgery]], [[radiotherapy]], and/or [[chemotherapy]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Rhabdomyosarcoma |publisher=Boston Children's Hospital |url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site1068/mainpageS1068P0.html}}</ref> The majority of rhabdomyosarcoma patients have between a 50–85% survival rate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wexler, L |title=

*Osteosarcoma is treated with surgical resection of as much of the cancer as possible, often along with [[neoadjuvant chemotherapy]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1256857|Osteosarcoma Treatment & Management|treatment}}</ref> Radiotherapy is a second alternative although not as successful.

==Epidemiology==
Sarcomas are quite rare with only 15,000 new cases per year in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Borden EC, Baker LH, Bell RS, ''et al.'' |title=Soft tissue sarcomas of adults: state of the translational science |journal=Clin Cancer Res. |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=1941–56 |year=2003 |month=Jun |pmid=12796356 |url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12796356}}</ref>  Sarcomas therefore represent about one percent of the 1.5 million new cancer diagnoses in that country each year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cancer Facts & Figures 2009 |publisher=American Cancer Society |url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/STT/content/STT_1x_Cancer_Facts__Figures_2009.asp?from=fast}}</ref> 

[[Gastrointestinal stromal tumor]] (GIST) is the most common form of sarcoma, with approximately 3,000-3,500 cases per year in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tran T, Davila JA, El-Serag HB |title=The epidemiology of malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors: an analysis of 1,458 cases from 1992 to 2000 |journal=Am J Gastroenterol |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=162–8 |year=2005 |month=Jan |pmid=15654796 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2005.40709.x |url=}}</ref>  

Sarcomas affect people of all ages.  Approximately 50% of bone sarcomas and 20% of soft tissue sarcomas are diagnosed in people under the age of 35.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Darling, J |title=A Different View of Sarcoma Statistics |journal=ESUN |volume=4 |issue=6 |year=2007 |url=http://sarcomahelp.org/articles/sarcoma-statistics.html | accessdate=2012-10-06}}</ref> Some sarcomas, such as [[leiomyosarcoma]], [[chondrosarcoma]], and [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]] (GIST), are more common in adults than in children. Most high-grade bone sarcomas, including [[Ewing's sarcoma]] and [[osteosarcoma]], are much more common in children and young adults.
