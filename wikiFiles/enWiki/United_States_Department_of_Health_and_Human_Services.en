The '''United States Department of Health and Human Services''' ('''HHS'''), also known as the '''Health Department''', is a [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet-level]] department of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] with the goal of protecting the [[health]] of all Americans and providing essential human services. Its [[motto]] is "Improving the health, safety, and well-being of America". Before the separate federal [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] was created in 1979, it was called the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).

==History==
[[File:Flag of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.png|thumb|left|The flag of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, which consists of the department's seal on a blue field.]]
<!-- Family Support Administration redirects here -->
President [[Warren G. Harding|Harding]] proposed a Department of Education and Welfare as early as 1923, and similar proposals were also recommended by subsequent presidents, but for various reasons were not implemented.<ref name='Eisenhower 1953-03-12'>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=9794 |title=Special Message to the Congress Transmitting Reorganization Plan of 1953 Creating the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare |accessdate=2012-01-06 |last=Eisenhower |first=Dwight |date=1953-03-12 }}</ref> The Department was only created thirty years later under Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 pursuant to authority granted in the Reorganization Act of 1949, in which the president was allowed to create or reorganize executive branch departments as long as neither house of Congress passed a legislative veto. This power to create new departments was removed after 1962, and in the early 1980s the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] declared [[legislative veto]]es unconstitutional.  

Unlike statutes authorizing the creation of other executive departments, the contents of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 were never properly codified within the United States Code, although Congress did codify a later statute ratifying the Plan.  Today, the Plan is included an appendix to Title 5 of the United States Code.  The result is that HHS is the only executive department whose statutory foundation today rests on a confusing combination of several codified and uncodified statutes.  

The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was renamed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 1979,<ref>[http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t17t20+4573+0++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2820%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%283508%29%29%3ACITE Office of the Law Revision Counsel, U.S. House of Representatives, Title 20, Section 3508]</ref> when its education functions were transferred to the newly created [[United States Department of Education]] under the [[Department of Education Organization Act]].<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/53070589 Full text of the Department of Education Organization Act], P.L. 96-88</ref> HHS was left in charge of the Social Security Administration, agencies constituting the Public Health Service, and Family Support Administration. 

In 1995, the [[Social Security Administration]] was removed from the Department of Health and Human Services, and established as an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States Government.

HHS is administered by the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]], who is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS) is the main division of the HHS and is led by the [[United States Assistant Secretary for Health|Assistant Secretary for Health]]. The current Secretary, [[Kathleen Sebelius]] is the Vice-Chair of the [[United States Interagency Council on Homelessness]], and the Department of Health and Human Services is a member of the Council, which is dedicated to preventing and ending homelessness in America. 

The [[Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]], the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed service]] of the PHS, is led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] who is responsible for addressing matters concerning public health as authorized by the Secretary or by the Assistant Secretary of Health in addition to his or her primary mission of administering the Commissioned Corps. The [[Office of Inspector General]] (OIG) investigates criminal activity for HHS. The [[special agent]]s who work for OIG have the same title series "1811", training and authority as other federal criminal investigators, such as the [[FBI]], [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], [[DEA]] and [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. However, OIG Special Agents have special skills in investigating [[white collar crime]] related to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] fraud and abuse. Organized crime has dominated the criminal activity relative to this type of fraud.  

HHS-OIG investigates tens of millions of dollars in Medicare fraud each year. In addition, OIG will continue its coverage of all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]] by its multi-agency task forces (PSOC Task Forces) that identify, investigate, and prosecute individuals who willfully avoid payment of their child support obligations under the Child Support Recovery Act. 

HHS-OIG agents also provide protective services to the Secretary of HHS, and other department executives as necessary.

In 2002, the department released [[Healthy People 2010]], a national strategic initiative for improving the health of Americans.

==Strengthening Communities Fund==
In June 2010 the Department of Health and Human Services created the Strengthening Communities Fund<ref>{{cite web|first=U.S department of health and human services|title=Strengthening Communities Fund|url=http://www.hhs.gov/recovery/programs/scf/index.html}}</ref> as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment]] act.  The fund was appropriated $50 million to be given as grants to organizations in the United States who were engaged in Capacity Building programs.  The grants were given to two different types of [[capacity builders]]:

* State, Local and Tribal governments engaged in capacity building: grants will go to state local and tribal governments to equip them with the capacity to more effectively partner with faith-based  or non-faith based nonprofit organizations.<ref>{{cite web|first=Department of human health and services|title=American Recovery and Reinvestment Act|url=http://www.hhs.gov/recovery/reports/plans/pdf20100610/ACF%20SCF%20June%202010.pdf|publisher=HHS}}</ref> 
:: Capacity building in this program will involve education and outreach that catalyzes more involvement of nonprofit organizations in economic recovery
and building up nonprofit organization's abilities to tackle economic problems.  State, Local and Tribal governments can receive up to $250,000 in two year grants
* [[Nonprofit]] Social Service Providers engaged in capacity building: they will make grants available to nonprofit organizations who can assist other nonprofit organizations in organizational development, program development, leadership, and evaluations.  Nonprofits can receive up to $1 million in two year grants.

==Organization==
===Internal Structure===
The Department of Health and Human Services is led by the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services]], a member of the [[United States Cabinet]] appointed by the [[President of the United States]] with the consent of the [[United States Senate]].

The Secretary and Deputy Secretary are further assisted by seven Assistant Secretaries, who serve as top Departmental administrators.
