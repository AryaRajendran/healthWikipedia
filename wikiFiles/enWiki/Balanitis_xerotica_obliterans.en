'''Balanitis xerotica obliterans'''  is a [[dermatology|dermatological]] (skin) condition affecting the male genitalia. It was first described by Stuhmer in 1928, though earlier reports describe what may have been the same condition.<!--

BXO commonly occurs on the [[foreskin]] and [[glans penis]].<!--

[[Atrophy|Atrophic]] white patches appear on the affected area,<!--

and commonly, a whitish ring of indurated (hardened) tissue usually forms near the tip that may prevent retraction.<ref name="keogh2005" />

== Epidemiology ==
The true [[prevalence]] of Balanitis xerotica obliterans is controversial and unclear. One study calculated a rate of 0.6% of boys are affected by their 15th birthdays.<!--

Another reported a rate of 0.07%.<!--

However, a review noted that "with a high degree of suspicion and [[histology|histologic]] examination, the condition will prove to be much more frequent than one generally believes."<!--

According to some authors, the disease most frequently affects middle-aged men.<ref name="keogh2005" /> However, a large study reported that the age distribution was similar from 2 to 90 years of age, except for men in their twenties, who were at twice the risk.<ref name="kizer2003" /> The same study found that [[black people|black]] and [[Hispanic]] men had approximately twice the risk of white men. The authors suggested possible reasons for this, including access to health care, differences in neonatal circumcision rates, and climate differences.

Mallon ''et al.'' found that Balanitis xerotica obliterans was related to circumcision status. Adjusting for age, lack of circumcision was associated with an [[odds ratio]] of 53.55. The finding was [[statistical significance|statistically significant]].<ref name="mallon2000">{{cite journal | author = Mallon E, Hawkins D, Dinneen M, Francics N, Fearfield L, Newson R, Bunker C | title = Circumcision and genital dermatoses | journal = Arch Dermatol | volume = 136 | issue = 3 | pages = 350–4 | year = 2000 | month = March | pmid = 10724196 | doi = 10.1001/archderm.136.3.350}}</ref>
However, Balanitis xerotica obliterans has also been noted to occur after late circumcision, especially when performed for [[phimosis]].<ref name="freeman1941" /><ref name="mallon2000" /><ref name="kizer2003" />

== Etiology ==
What [[etiology (medicine) |causes]] Balanitis xerotica obliterans is uncertain. However, some possibilities have been suggested.

Some studies have shown that patients with  also show signs of suffering from [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] disorders.<ref name="azurdia1999">{{cite journal | author = Azurdia R, Luzzi G, Byren I, Welsh K, Wojnarowska F, Marren P, Edwards A | title = Lichen sclerosus in adult men: a study of HLA associations and susceptibility to autoimmune disease | journal = [[British Journal of Dermatology]] | volume = 140 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–83 | year = 1999 | month = January | pmid = 10215772 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2133.1999.02611.x}}</ref><!--

However, this finding is not repeated in every study.<ref name="meyrickthomas1983" />

Infection from "[[human papilloma virus]] (serotype 16 in particular), [[spirochaete|spirochetes]] and atypical [[mycobacterium|mycobacteria]]" has also been suggested as a cause.<ref name="kizer2003" /> Additional suggestions include "[[pemphigus|pemphigus vulgaris]] and chronic nonspecific bacterial [[balanitis]]".<!--

=== Relationship to phimosis ===

=== Relationship to lichen sclerosus ===
Many researchers regard Balanitis xerotica obliterans as [[lichen sclerosus et atrophicus]] (LSA) of the penis, LSA is also known as [[lichen sclerosus]] (LS). Lately Balanitis xerotica obliterans was coded as part of LSA by Medical literature search tool [[MEDLINE|Medline]].<!--

However, Mallon ''et al.'' suggest that Balanitis xerotica obliterans "may be a consequence of other fibrosing [[dermatosis|dermatoses]], such as [[lichen planus]] and cicatricial pemphigoid."<ref name="mallon2000" /> When occurring on the male genitals, the term 'Balanitis xerotica obliterans' is traditionally used.<ref name="keogh2005" />

== Prevention ==
There is no known means of preventing BXO. However, one study reports that the data "suggest that circumcision prevents or protects against common infective penile dermatoses."<ref name="mallon2000" />

== Prognosis ==
BXO is chronic and often progressive.<ref name="keogh2005" /> Please see the following section on treatment.

The condition may cause [[pain]], [[irritation]], and disturbance of [[sexual intercourse|sexual function]].<ref name="edwards1996" />

In later stages, a [[urinary meatus|meatal]] [[stenosis|stricture]] may occur, causing [[urinary retention]].<ref name="freeman1941" /><ref name="keogh2005" /> This may result in [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] or [[kidney]] damage.<ref name="keogh2005" />

The coronal sulcus and [[frenulum]] may be destroyed.<ref name="keogh2005" />

[[Phimosis]] or [[paraphimosis]] may occur.<ref name="keogh2005" />

Several studies indicate that BXO may play a pre-[[cancer]]ous role,<!--

Depasquale ''et al.'' note that many surgeons do not send circumcision specimens for histology. They caution that this practice "is becoming medicolegally indefensible in a litigation-conscious society, where the clinical sequelae of BXO are often misinterpreted by the patient as surgical errors."<ref name="depasquale2000" />
