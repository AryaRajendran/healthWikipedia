Treatment consists of simple removal of the polyp and prognosis is generally good. About 1% of cervical polyps will show [[neoplastic]] change which may lead to [[cancer]]. They are most common in post-[[Menstruation|menstrual]], pre-[[Menopause|menopausal]] women who have been pregnant.
==Cause==
The cause of cervical polyps is uncertain, but they are often associated with inflammation of the cervix.<ref>{{cite web

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Cervical polyp.jpg|thumb|cervical polyp in ultrasound]]
Cervical polyps can be seen during a [[pelvic examination]] as red or purple projections from the [[cervical canal]].<ref name="Medline" /> Diagnosis can be confirmed by a cervical [[biopsy]] which will reveal the nature of the cells present.<ref name="Medline" />

==Treatment==
Cervical polyps can be removed using ring [[forceps]].<ref>{{cite web

==Prognosis==
99% of cervical polyps will remain benign and 1% will at some point show [[neoplastic]] change.<ref>{{Cite web

==Structure==
Cervical polyps are finger-like growths, generally less than 1&nbsp;cm in diameter.<ref name="Medline" /><ref name="PGU" /> They are generally bright red in colour, with a spongy texture.<ref name="TZ" /> They may be attached to the cervix by a stalk (pedunculated) and occasionally [[prolapse]] into the [[vagina]] where they can be mistaken for [[endometrial polyp]]s or [[submucosa]]l [[fibroid]]s.<ref name="PGU" />
