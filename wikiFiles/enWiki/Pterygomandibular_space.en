The '''pterygomandibular space''' is a [[fascial spaces of the head and neck|fascial space of the head and neck]] (sometimes also termed [[fascia]]l spaces or tissue spaces). It is a [[potential space]] in the head and is paired on each side. It is located between the [[medial pterygoid muscle]] and the medial surface of the [[ramus of the mandible]]. The pterygomandibular space is one of the four [[compartment (anatomy)|compartment]]s of the [[masticator space]].<ref name="Hupp 2008">{{cite book|last=Hupp JR, Ellis E, Tucker MR|title=Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323049030|pages=317–333|edition=5th ed.}}</ref>

==Location and structure==
===Anatomic boundaries===
The boundaries of each pterygomandibular space are:<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 
* the posterior border of the [[buccal space]] anteriorly
* the [[parotid gland]] posteriorly
* the lateral pterygoid muscle superiorly
* the inferior border of the mandible (lingual surface) inferiorly
* the medial pterygoid muscle medially (the space is superficial to medial pterygoid)
* the ascending ramus of the mandible laterally (the space is deep to the ramus of the mandible)

===Communications===
the communications of each pterygomandibular space are:<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 
* to the buccal space anteriorly
* to the [[lateral pharyngeal space]] and [[peritonsillar space]] medially (around the medial pterygoid muscle).
* to the [[submasseteric space]] laterally (around the ramus of the mandible)
* to the [[parotid space]] posteriorly
* to the [[infratemporal space|deep temporal/infratemporal space]] superiorly

===Contents===
In health, the space contains:
* the [[mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve]],<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 
* the [[inferior alveolar artery]] and vein,<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 
* the [[sphenomandibular ligament]].<ref name="Khoury 2011">{{cite journal|last=Khoury|first=JN|coauthors=Mihailidis, S; Ghabriel, M; Townsend, G|title=Applied anatomy of the pterygomandibular space: improving the success of inferior alveolar nerve blocks.|journal=Australian dental journal|date=2011 Jun|volume=56|issue=2|pages=112-21|pmid=21623801}}</ref>

==Clinical relevance==
The pterygomandibular space is the area where [[local anesthetic]] solution is deposited during an [[inferior alveolar nerve block]], a common procedure used to anesthetize the distribution of the inferior alveolar nerve. Rarely, [[pathogenic]] micro-organisms from the mouth may be seeded into the pterygomandibular space during this injection and cause a [[needle tract infection]] of the space.<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> It is also occasionally reported that the needle breaks off and is retained in the pterygomandibular space during this injection.<ref name="Bedrock 1999">{{cite journal|last=Bedrock|first=RD|coauthors=Skigen, A; Dolwick, MF|title=Retrieval of a broken needle in the pterygomandibular space.|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association (1939)|date=1999 May|volume=130|issue=5|pages=685-7|pmid=10332133}}</ref> Minor oral surgery is then required to remove the fractured needle.<ref name="Bedrock 1999" /> Due to its high vascularity, injections into the pterygomandibular space carry a high risk of [[intravascular injection]] (injecting into a blood vessel).<ref name="Taghavi Zenouz 2008">{{cite journal|last=Taghavi Zenouz|first=A|coauthors=Ebrahimi, H; Mahdipour, M; Pourshahidi, S; Amini, P; Vatankhah, M|title=The Incidence of Intravascular Needle Entrance during Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block Injection.|journal=Journal of dental research, dental clinics, dental prospects|date=2008 Winter|volume=2|issue=1|pages=38-41|pmid=23285329|pmc=3533637 }}</ref><!-- primary source, used content from background section rather than original research section --> Another possible complication of an inferior alveolar nerve block occurs when the needle is placed too deep, passing through the pterygomandibular space and into the parotid gland behind. Branches of the [[facial nerve]] run through the substance of the parotid gland and so this is manifest as a transient [[facial palsy]]. The pterygomandibular space is one of the possible spaces into which a tooth may be displaced into during [[dental extraction]], e.g. of a maxillary [[wisdom tooth]].<ref name="Ozer 2013">{{cite journal|last=Ozer|first=N|coauthors=Uçem, F; Saruhanoğlu, A; Yilmaz, S; Tanyeri, H|title=Removal of a Maxillary Third Molar Displaced into Pterygopalatine Fossa via Intraoral Approach.|journal=Case reports in dentistry|date=2013|volume=2013|pages=392148|pmid=23476814|pmc=3580928}}</ref> A [[mandibular fracture]] in the angle region may also be the cause of a pterygomandibular space infection.<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 

The signs and symptoms of an isolated pterygomandiublar infection may include [[trismus]] (difficulty opening the mouth), however there is not usually any externally visible facial swelling.<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> Intra-orally, there may be swelling and [[erythema]] (redness) or the anterior tonsillar pillar (the [[Palatoglossal arch]]) and deviation of the [[uvula]] to the unaffected side.<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> The airway may be compressed. Treatment is by surgical [[incision and drainage]], and the incision may be placed inside the mouth or two incision may be used, one inside the mouth and one outside.<ref name="Hupp 2008" />

===Odontogenic infections===
[[Odontogenic infection]]s may spread to involve the pterygomandibular space, and the most common teeth responsible for this are the mandibular second and third molar teeth.<ref name="Hargreaves 2010">{{cite book|last=Hargreaves KM, Cohen S (editors), Berman LH (web editor)|title=Cohen's pathways of the pulp|year=2010|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-0-323-06489-7|pages=590–594|edition=10th}}</ref>
