'''Vision therapy''', also known as '''[[vision training]]''', is used to improve vision skills such as eye movement control, eye focusing and coordination, and the teamwork of the two eyes. It involves a series of procedures carried out under professional supervision, usually by a specially-trained [[optometrist]].

Vision therapy can be prescribed when a comprehensive eye examination indicates that it is an appropriate treatment option for the patient. The specific program of therapy is based on the results of standardized tests, the needs of the patient, and the patient's signs and symptoms. Programs typically involve eye exercises and the use of lenses, prisms, filters, occluders, specialized instruments, and computer programs. The course of therapy, which may take from several weeks to several months, is closely monitored by the therapist.<ref name="AOA2"> {{cite web | url = http://www.aoa.org/x7856.xml | title = Vision Therapy | accessdate = 2012-05-05 | publisher = American Optometric Association}}</ref><ref name="AOA3"> {{cite news | title = Vision Therapy | date = 1999-06-25 | publisher = American Optometric Association | url = http://www.aoa.org/x5411.xml | work = Information for Health Care and Other Allied Professionals A Joint Organizational Policy Statement of the American Academy of Optometry and the American Optometric Association | accessdate = 2012-05-05}}</ref>

==Historical development==
Various forms of visual therapy have been used for centuries.<ref name="Helveston">{{cite journal | last1 = Helveston | first1 = EM | title = Visual training: current status in ophthalmology | journal = American journal of ophthalmology | volume = 140 | issue = 5 | pages = 903–10 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16310470 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajo.2005.06.003 }}</ref> The concept of vision therapy was introduced in the late nineteenth century for the non-surgical treatment of [[strabismus]]. This early and traditional form of vision therapy was the foundation of what is now known as [[orthoptics]].<ref>Georgievski Z, Koklanis K, Fenton A, Koukouras I. Victorian orthoptists' performance in the photo evaluation of diabetic retinopathy. Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology, 2007, 35(8): 733-738. [Pubmed Link]</ref>

In the first half of the twentieth century, orthoptists, working with [[ophthalmologists]], introduced a variety of training techniques mainly designed to improve binocular function. In the second half of the twentieth century, vision therapy began to be used by optometrists and paramedical personnel to treat conditions ranging from uncomfortable vision to poor reading and academic performance. It has also been used specifically to improve eyesight, and even to improve athletic performance.<ref name='Helveston'/>

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, most vision therapy is done by optometrists. Based on assessments of claims and studies of published data, ophthalmologists claim that, except for near point of convergence exercises, vision therapy lacks documented evidence of effectiveness.<ref name='Helveston'/>

==Current definitions in clinical practice==
{{ref improve section|date=May 2012}}
Vision Therapy encompasses a wide variety of non-surgical methods<ref name="Aetna">Aetna. [http://www.aetna.com/cpb/data/CPBA0489.html Aetna Clinical Policy Bulletins: Vision Therapy.] Retrieved August 2, 2006.</ref> {{citation broken|date=May 2012}} which some {{by whom|date=May 2012}} have divided into two broad categories based on their clinical acceptance and general practice by [[eyecare professional]]s:

*1) '''Orthoptic Vision Therapy''', also known as [[orthoptics]].
It may be prescribed to patients with problems of visual related skills required for [[reading (process)|reading]], [[asthenopia|eye strain]], visually induced [[headaches]], [[strabismus]] and/or [[diplopia]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It is commonly practiced by [[optometrist]]s and [[behavioral optometry|behavioral optometrists]] - however, more specialized problems are co-managed between [[orthoptist]]s and [[ophthalmologist]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Australia |url=http://joboutlook.gov.au/pages/occupation.aspx?search=skillshortages&code=2514 |title=Optometrists and Orthoptists |publisher=Job Outlook |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2012}}

*2) '''Behavioral Vision Therapy''', or '''Visual Integration Vision Therapy''' (also known as behavioral or [[behavioral optometry|developmental optometry]]).<ref name="AOA1">American Academy of Ophthalmology. [http://www.aao.org/education/library/cta/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&PageID=1224 Complementary Therapy Assessment: Vision Therapy for Learning Disabilities.] Retrieved August 2, 2006.</ref>

Behavioural Vision Therapy does not limit itself to disorders of the [[visual system]]. For example, [[behavioral optometry|Behavioral Optometrists]] hold that the sensitivity of a [[professional athlete]]'s [[peripheral vision]] on the playing field may have enhanced responsiveness to fast moving objects with vision therapy, beyond the normal realm general improvement with practicing their sport. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} [[Ophthalmologist]]s and [[orthoptist]]s do not endorse these exercises as having clinically significant validity for improvements in vision.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Furthermore, absent of any visual pathology they view perceptual-motor deficiencies as being in the sphere of either [[speech therapy]], [[occupational therapy]] or [[physical therapy]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

*3) '''Perception (motor) Therapy'''
Although the problems may have visual consequences, the visual system itself may be intact. Common management of [[Management of dyslexia|dyslexia]] and [[sensory processing disorder]]s by [[Speech and language pathology|Speech Pathologists]] and [[Occupational Therapy|Occupational Therapists]] for pathological or neurological conditions such as [[hemispatial neglect]] is viewed as outside of the realm of what is classified here as 'behavioural vision therapy'. This differentiation is primarily based on these disorders having widespread and independent efficacy of treatment.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Orthoptic visual therapy==
{{Dablink|for more detail, see also [[Orthoptics]].}}

Orthoptics aims to treat [[binocular vision]] disorders such as [[strabismus]], and [[diplopia]]. Key factors involved include: Eye Movement Control, Simultaneous Focus at Far, Sustaining Focus at Far, Simultaneous Focus at Near, Sustaining Focus at Near, Simultaneous Alignment at Far, Sustaining Alignment at Far, Simultaneous Alignment at Near, Sustaining Alignment at Near, Central Vision (Visual Acuity) and Depth Awareness.<ref name="College of Optometrists in Vision Development">COVD. [http://www.covd.org/Home/ChildrensVisionLearningMonth/17VisualSkills/tabid/274/Default.aspx] Retrieved July 27, 2010.</ref>

Some of the exercises used are:
*Near point of [[Convergence (eye)|convergence]] exercises (i.e. "pencil push-ups"),
*Base-out prism reading, stereogram cards, computerized training programs are used to improve fusional vergence.<ref name="emedicine">Bartis, MJ. ''[http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic553.htm Convergence Insufficiency.]'' eMedicine. January 25, 2005.</ref>
*The wearing of [[convex lenses]]
*The wearing of [[Biconcave lens|concave lenses]]
* "Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises" also employ various eye exercises, however, these are designed to alleviate vestibular disorders, such as dizziness, rather than eye problems.<ref name="dizziness-and-balance1">{{cite web|url=http://www.dizziness-and-balance.com/treatment/rehab/cawthorne.html |title=Cawthorne-Cooksey Exercises for Dizziness |publisher=Dizziness-and-balance.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}</ref>
* Antisuppression exercises - this is being less commonly practiced, although occasionally it may be used.

There is widespread acceptance of orthoptic therapy indications for:
*Convergence insufficiency.  Patients who experience eyestrain, "tired" eyes, or diplopia (double vision) while reading or performing other near work, and who have convergence insufficiency may benefit from orthoptic treatment.  Patients whose outward drift occurs at distance rather than at near distance are less ideal candidates for treatment.
*Intermittent exotropia.<ref name="Zhang KK 2007">Zhang KK, Koklanis K, Georgievski Z. Intermittent exotropia: A review of the natural history and non-surgical treatment outcomes. Australian Orthoptic Journal, 2007, 39(1): 31-37.</ref> This is often linked to convergence insufficiency.

[[Convergence insufficiency]] is a common [[binocular vision]] disorder characterized by [[asthenopia]], eye fatigue and discomfort.<ref>Bartiss M. [http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic553.htm "Convergence Insufficiency."] eMedicine.com. Retrieved August 2, 2006.</ref> Asthenopia may be aggravated by close work and is thought by some to contribute to reading inefficiency.<ref name="AOA1"/> In 2005, the Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (CITT) published two large, randomized clinical studies examining the efficacy of orthoptic vision therapy in the treatment of symptomatic convergence insufficiency. Although neither study examined reading efficiency or comprehension, both demonstrated that computerized home orthoptic exercises, when combined with weekly in-office vision therapy, were more effective than "pencil pushups" (a commonly prescribed home-based treatment) for improving the symptoms of asthenopia and the [[convergence (eye)|convergence]] ability of the eyes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Scheiman | first1 = M | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = GL | last3 = Cotter | first3 = S | last4 = Cooper | first4 = J | last5 = Kulp | first5 = M | last6 = Rouse | first6 = M | last7 = Borsting | first7 = E | last8 = London | first8 = R | last9 = Wensveen | first9 = J | title = A randomized clinical trial of treatments for convergence insufficiency in children | journal = Archives of ophthalmology | volume = 123 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–24 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15642806 | doi = 10.1001/archopht.123.1.14 }}</ref><ref>Scheiman M, Mitchell GL, Cotter S, Kulp MT, Cooper J, Rouse M, Borsting E, London R, Wensveen J.

==Behavioural visual therapy==
Behavioural VT aims to treat problems including difficulties of visual attention and concentration, which behavioral optometrists classify as visual information processing weaknesses. These manifest themselves as an inability to sustain focus or to shift focus from one area of space to another.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  Some assert that poor [[eye tracking]] affects reading skills, and that improving tracking can improve reading.<ref>[http://www.childrensvision.com/vision_therapy.htm ]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref>

This includes vision therapy for: Peripheral Vision, Color Perception, Gross Visual-Motor, Fine Visual-Motor, and Visual Perception.<ref name="College of Optometrists in Vision Development"/>

Some of the exercises involve the use of:
*Marsden balls
*Rotation trainers
*Syntonics
*Balance board/beams
*Saccadic fixators
*Directional sequencers

Behavioral vision therapy is practiced primarily by optometrists after doing extra studies in this area. Major optometric organizations, including the [[American Optometric Association]], the [[American Academy of Optometry]], the [[College of Optometrists in Vision Development]], and the [[Optometric Extension Program]], support the assertion that non-strabismic visual therapy does not directly treat learning disorders, but rather addresses underlying visual problems which are claimed to affect learning potential.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Vision, learning and dyslexia. A joint organizational policy statement of the American Academy of Optometry and the American Optometric Association | url = http://www.aoa.org/x1910.xml | journal = Journal of the American Optometric Association | volume = 68 | issue = 5 | pages = 284–6 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9170793 }}</ref>

Major organizations, including the [[International Orthoptic Association]] and the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] have alternatively so far concluded that there is no current validity for clinically significant improvements in vision with Behavioural Vision Therapy, therefore they do not practice it.

===Efficacy of behavioural visual therapy===

In 1988, a review of 238 scientific articles was published in the ''Journal of the American Optometric Association'' widely defined vision therapy as "a clinical approach for correcting and ameliorating the effects of eye movement disorders, non-strabismic binocular dysfunctions, focusing disorders, strabismus, amblyopia, nystagmus, and certain visual perceptual (information processing) disorders." - and thereby did not discriminate between orthoptic and behavioural visual therapy. The paper was positive about vision therapy generally: "It is evident from the research that there is scientific support for the efficacy of vision therapy in modifying and improving oculomotor, accommodative, and binocular system disorders, as measured by standardized clinical and laboratory testing methods for patients of all ages for whom it is properly undertaken and employed."<ref>The 1986/1987 Future of Visual Development/Performance Task Force. "Special Report: The efficacy of optometric vision therapy." ''J Am Optom Assoc''. 1988;59:95-105. PMID 3283203</ref>

A more recent (2005) review concluded less positively that: ''"Less robust, but believable, evidence indicates visual training may be useful in developing fine stereoscopic skills and improving visual field remnants after brain damage. As yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in the mainstream literature supporting the use of eye exercises in the remainder of the areas reviewed, and their use therefore remains controversial."''<ref name="Rawstron">{{cite journal	| author=Rawstron JA, Burley CD, Elder MJ | journal=J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus | year=2005 | volume=42 | issue=2 | pages=82–8 | title=A systematic review of the applicability and efficacy of eye exercises	| pmid=15825744}}</ref>

In 2006, noted neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] published a case study about "Stereo Sue", a woman who had regained her [[stereo vision]], absent for 48 years, after undergoing vision therapy. The article was published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, which is fact-checked but not peer-reviewed, very few details were given of the exact therapies used and the article discussed only one case of stereo rehabilitation.<ref name=Sacks>{{cite news | author=Oliver Sacks | title=A Neurologist's Notebook: "Stereo Sue" | publisher=The New Yorker | date=June 19, 2006 | page=64}}</ref>  However, the woman described by Sacks, [[Susan R. Barry|Susan Barry]], a neurobiology professor at Mt. Holyoke College, subsequently published a book, "Fixing My Gaze." The book discusses multiple case histories and details the therapy procedures and the science underlying them.

A systematic review of the literature on the effects of vision therapy on visual field defects published in 2007 concluded that it was unclear to what extent patients benefited from [[vision restoration therapy]] (VRT) as "no study has given a satisfactory answer." The authors concluded that ''scanning compensatory therapy'' (SCT) seemed to provide a more successful rehabilitation, and simpler training techniques, therefore they recommended SCT until the effects of VRT could be defined.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry|year=2007|volume=78|issue=6|pages=555–64|title=The effect of visual training for patients with visual field defects due to brain damage: a systematic review|author=Bouwmeester L, Heutink J, Lucas C.|url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/78/6/555.long|doi=10.1136/jnnp.2006.103853|pmid=17135455|pmc=2077942}}</ref>

A 2008 review of the literature concluded that "there is a continued paucity of controlled trials in the literature to support behavioural optometry approaches. Although there are areas where the available evidence is consistent with claims made by behavioural optometrists ... a large majority of behavioural management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated."<ref name=Barrett>{{cite journal | author=Brendan T. Barrett | journal=Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics | volume=29 | issue=1 | year=2008 | pages=4–25 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-1313.2008.00607.x | title=A critical evaluation of the evidence supporting the practice of behavioural vision therapy | pmid=19154276}}</ref>

Other than for [[strabismus]] (such as intermittent [[exotropia]]<ref name="Zhang KK 2007"/>) and [[convergence insufficiency]], the consensus among ''ophthalmologists'', ''orthoptists'' and ''pediatricians'' is that non-strabismic visual therapy lacks documented evidence of effectiveness.<ref name="Helveston"/><ref name=Rawstron/> In 1998, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]], and [[American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus]] issued a policy statement regarding the use of vision therapy specifically for the treatment of ''learning problems'' and ''dyslexia.'' According to the statement: "No scientific evidence exists for the efficacy of eye exercises ('vision therapy')... in the remediation of these complex pediatric neurological conditions."<ref name=JointStatement1998>{{cite web | publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, American Academy of Ophthalmology. | url=http://www.aao.org/about/policy/upload/Learning-Disabilities-Dyslexia-and-Vision.pdf | title=Policy Statement: Learning Disabilities, Dyslexia, and Vision | date=September, 1998}}</ref> More recently, in 2004, the American Academy of Ophthalmology released a position statement asserting that there is no evidence that vision therapy retards the progression of ''myopia'', no evidence that it improves visual function in those with ''hyperopia'' or ''astigmatism,'' or that it improves ''vision lost through disease processes.''<ref name=AAOph2004>{{cite web | publisher=American Academy of Ophthalmology | url=http://www.aao.org/education/guidelines/cta/training.cfm | title=Complementary Therapy Assessment: Vision Training for Refractive Errors | year=2004 | accessdate=2008-04-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071015183505/http://aao.org/education/guidelines/cta/training.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-15}}</ref> This was also supported by the International Orthoptic Association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalorthoptics.org/ |title=International Orthoptic Association |publisher=Internationalorthoptics.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}</ref>

The Joint Statement mentioned above<ref name="JointStatement1998" /> was criticised at the time by Merrill Bowan, a vision therapy enthusiast, for being biased, with the author of a rebuttal concluding "The AAP/AAO/AAPOS paper contains errors and internal inconsistencies. Through highly selective reference choices, it misrepresents the great body of evidence from the literature that supports a relationship between visual and perceptual problems as they contribute to classroom difficulties.".<ref name=Bowan>Bowan, M. Learning disabilities, dyslexia, and vision: a subject review--a rebuttal, literature review, and commentary. Optometry. 2002 Sep;73(9):553-75.</ref> The author also states that the Joint Statement presents an unsupported opinion by implication that Optometrists claim that vision therapy cures the learning problem.  A similar criticism could be levelled at the 2004 American Academy of Ophthalmology paper which implies that vision therapy is claimed to treat "vision lost through disease processes".  There is a common theme that critics of vision therapy seem to do by placing vision therapy under the same banner with alternative therapies.  By implication, the lack of evidence for the alternative therapies is cited as a lack of evidence for vision therapy.  No supporting evidence is given that vision therapy is actually used to treat eye disease or vision lost through disease processes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Some optometrists take a slightly different view. In 1999 a joint statement by the [[American Academy of Optometry]], the [[American Optometric Association]], the [[College of Optometrists in Vision Development]] and [[Optometric Extension Program|Optometric Extension Program Foundation]] reported: "Many visual conditions can be treated effectively with spectacles or contact lenses alone; however, some are most effectively treated with vision therapy....Research has demonstrated that vision therapy can be an effective treatment option for ''ocular motility problems, non-strabismic binocular disorders, strabismus, amblyopia, accommodative disorders (and) visual information processing disorders.''"<ref name=Optometry1999>{{cite web | publisher=American Academy of Optometry | url=http://covd.org/Portals/0/Vision-Therapy%20-%20JOPS%20AAO%20&%20AOA.pdf | title=Vision Therapy a joint organizational policy statement | year=1999}}</ref>

==Eye exercises==
{{ref improve section|date=May 2012}}
The eye exercises used in vision therapy can generally be divided into two groups; those employed for "strabismic" outcomes and those employed for "non-strabismic" outcomes, to improve eye health.

Some of the exercises used are
*Near point of [[Convergence (eye)|convergence]] training, or the ability for both eyes to focus on a single point in space,
*Base-out prism reading, [[stereogram]] cards, computerized training programs are used to improve fusional vergence.<ref name="emedicine" />{{failed verification|date=May 2012}}
*The wearing of [[convex lenses]]
*The wearing of [[Biconcave lens|concave lenses]]
* "Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises" also employ various eye exercises, however, these are designed to alleviate vestibular disorders, such as dizziness, rather than eye problems.<ref name="dizziness-and-balance1"/>
* Antisuppression exercises - this is no longer commonly practiced, although occasionally it may be used.

The eye exercises used in Behavioural Vision Therapy, also known as Developmental Optometry is practiced primarily by Behavioural Optometrists.  Behavioural Vision Therapy therapy aims to treat problems including difficulties of '''visual attention and concentration''', which may manifest themselves as an inability to sustain focus or to shift focus from one area of space to another.

Some of the exercises used are:
*Marsden balls
*Rotation trainers
*Syntonics
*Balance board/beams
*Saccadic fixators
*Directional sequencers

Ophthalmologists and orthoptists do not endorse these exercises as having clinically significant validity for improvements in vision. Usually they see these perceptual-motor activities being in the sphere of either [[speech therapy]] or [[occupational therapy]].

Fusional Amplitude and Relative Fusional Amplitude training
*Designed to alleviate [[convergence insufficiency]]. The CITT study (Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial) was is a randomized, double blind multi-centre trial (high level of reliability) indicates that Orthoptic Vision Therapy is an effective method of treatment of convergence insufficiency (CI). Both optometry and ophthalmology were co-authors of this study.

*Designed to alleviate intermittent [[exotropia]]<ref>Zhang KK, Koklanis K, Georgievski Z. Intermittent Exotropia: A Review of the Natural History and Non-surgical Treatment Outcomes. Australian Orthoptic Journal, 2007;39(1):31-37.</ref> or other less common forms of strabismus.

==Controversy==
Some ophthalmologists are skeptical about the efficacy of "vision therapy" stating that it lacks data and is mostly anecdotal.<ref name="stlbeacon1">{{cite web | url=https://www.stlbeacon.org/#!/content/17515/vision_therapy_part_2|title=Ophthalmologists express skepticism about vision therapy|date=30 Nov 2010|publisher=St. Louis Beacon |author=Jo Seltzer}}</ref> In 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics along with the American Academy of Ophthalmology "essentially declared war" on developmental optometry, as Judith Warner wrote in a New York Times article.<ref name="stlbeacon1"/><ref name="nytimes1">{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/magazine/14vision-t.html?pagewanted=all|title=Concocting a Cure for Kids With Issues|publisher=|date=10 March 2010|author=Judith Warner}}</ref> Even within the field of optometry the U.K. College of Optometrists noted the "Continued absence of rigorous scientific evidence to support behavioral management approaches" in the second college of Optometrists report.  <ref name="nytimes1"/> The American Academy of Pediatrics also essentially declared war on behavioral optometry. In 2009 it reviewed 35 years of the literature in support of vision therapy and issued a statement — in conjunction with other ophthalmological associations — condemning the therapy and its contention that it could help with learning disabilities. Visual problems, it claimed, are not the basis for learning disabilities.<ref name="nytimes1"/> It issued a stern warning about the seductions of treatments that sound convincing but aren’t based on science: “Ineffective, controversial methods of treatment such as vision therapy may give parents and teachers a false sense of security that a child’s learning difficulties are being addressed, may waste family and/or school resources and may delay proper instruction or remediation.”<ref name="nytimes1"/> The website by the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology adn Strabismus states: "Behavioral vision therapy is considered to be scientifically unproven" and "There is no evidence that vision therapy delays the progression or leads to correction of myopia."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aapos.org/terms/conditions/108 |title=Vision Therapy — AAPOS |publisher=Aapos.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}</ref>
