In 1997 Congress established per-person [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] spending limits, or ''therapy cap'' for nonhospital outpatient therapy, but responding to concerns that some people with Medicare need extensive services, it has since placed temporary moratoriums on the caps.    The '''therapy cap''' is a combined $1,810 (USD) Medicare cap for physical therapy and speech language pathology, and a separate $1,810 cap for occupational therapy.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=35598 Therapy cap]</ref>

Medicare patients requiring rehabilitation from disabilities, car accidents, hip injuries, stroke, and other ailments would be limited to roughly two months worth of treatments at an outpatient therapy clinic.  Any patients that exceed the cap, whether they are healed or not, would have to stop therapy, or pay for the therapy services out of their own pocket.<ref>[http://www.painfixers.com/2006_09_01_archive.html Monetary cap translates to 2 months]</ref>

==Controversy==
Several medical associations and organizations including the [[American Physical Therapy Association]] and [[American Occupational Therapy Association]] have lobbied against therapy caps because the bill restricted disabled seniors, stroke patients, and other severe cases from receiving therapy treatments.<ref>[http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?section=Stop_the_Therapy_Cap_and_Fee_Schedule_Cuts&Template=/TaggedPage/TaggedPageDisplay.cfm&TPLID=298&ContentID=34782 APTA advocacy]</ref>

Another controversy is the original bill combined physical therapy and speech therapy together allowing only a shared $1810 per calendar year for both therapy services.    This error has yet to be corrected by congress, further limiting therapy services to outpatients.

==Studies==
The [[Government Accountability Office]] have concluded through an independent study that the therapy caps are not meeting the needs of patients.<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0659.pdf GAO study on therapy cap]</ref>

The Study and Report on Outpatient Therapy Utilization by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released on September 2002 concluded that older patients require more therapy than what the cap allowed: “patients who are female, older, minorities, live in certain geographic regions, require the services of institutional providers and suffer from complex medical conditions are more likely to require more costly outpatient therapy services than the general outpatient therapy population.”

The [[American Heart Association]] concluded that the Medicare caps are costing the government more money in the long run, especially to stroke patients.  According to their study, arbitrary caps on rehabilitation therapies punish stroke patients who often undergo needed extensive rehabilitation programs.  More than 5.4 million Americans, including 4.4 million people with Medicare, are living with the consequences of stroke. The failure to properly treat and rehabilitate stroke patients costs $21.8 billion annually in lost productivity and disability expenses.<ref>[http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Therapy_Cap&CONTENTID=27321&TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&tr=y&auid=1276176 Letter to Congress From AHA]</ref>
