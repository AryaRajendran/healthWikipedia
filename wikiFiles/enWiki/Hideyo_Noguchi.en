{{Japanese name|Noguchi}}
{{nihongo|'''Hideyo Noguchi'''|野口 英世|''Noguchi Hideyo''|extra=November 24, 1876 – May 21, 1928}}, also known as {{nihongo|Seisaku Noguchi|野口 清作|''Noguchi Seisaku''}}, was a prominent Japanese [[bacteriologist]] who discovered the agent of [[syphilis]] as the cause of progressive paralytic disease in 1911.

==Early life==
Noguchi Hideyo was born in [[Inawashiro, Fukushima|Inawashiro]], [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima prefecture]] in 1876.  When he was one and a half years old he fell down into a fireplace and suffered a burn injury on his left hand. There was no doctor in the small village, but one of the men examined the boy. "The fingers of the left hand are mostly gone," he said, "and the left arm and the left foot and the right hand are burned; I know not how badly."

In 1883 he entered Mitsuwa elementary school. Thanks to generous contributions from his teacher Kobayashi and his friends, he was able to receive surgery on his badly burned left hand. He recovered about 70% mobility and functionality in his left hand through the operation.

Noguchi decided to become a doctor to help those in need. He apprenticed himself to {{nihongo|Dr. Kanae Watanabe|渡部 鼎|''Watanabe Kanae''}}, the same doctor who had performed the surgery on his hand. He entered Saisei Gakusha, which later became [[Nippon Medical School]]. He passed the examinations to practice medicine when he was twenty years old in 1897. He showed signs of great talent and was supported in his studies by Dr. [[Morinosuke Chiwaki]]. In 1898, he changed his first name to Hideyo after reading a novel about a doctor who had the same name - Seisaku - as him. The doctor in the novel was intelligent like Noguchi, but became lazy and ruined his life.

==Career==
In 1900 Noguchi moved to the [[United States]], where he obtained a job as a research assistant with Dr. [[Simon Flexner]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and later at the [[Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research]]. He thrived in this environment.<ref>Flexner, James Thomas. (1996). [http://books.google.com/books?id=zHUQdmAlX-4C&pg=PA51&dq=hideyo+noguchi&lr=&client=firefox-a&sig=A-TRnP-lyJslsJauKPsRlrJ_Lmw#PPA51,M1  ''Maverick's Progress,'' pp. 51]-52.</ref>  At this time his work concerned [[poisonous snakes]].  In part, his move was motivated by difficulties in obtaining a medical position in Japan, as prospective employers were concerned about the impact the hand deformity would have on potential patients. In a research setting, this handicap became a non-issue.  He and his peers learned from their work and from each other. In this period, a fellow research assistant in Flexner's lab was Frenchman [[Alexis Carrel]], who would go on to win a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1912;<ref>Gray, Christopher. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E6D81739F936A15751C0A9679C8B63&scp=1&sq=hideyo+noguchi&st=nyt  " Streetscapes/Rockefeller University, 62nd to 68th Streets Along the East River; From a Child's Death Came a Medical Institute's Birth,"] ''New York Times.'' February 25, 2001.</ref> and Noguchi's work would later attract the Prize committee's scrutiny.<ref>Japanese Government Internet TV: [http://nettv.gov-online.go.jp/eng/prg/prg1143.html  "Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize," streaming video 2007/04/26]</ref>  The Nobel Foundation archives have been only recently opened for public inspection; and what was once only speculation is now confirmed. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1913-1915, 1920, 1921 and 1924-1927.<ref name=nominationdb>{{cite web|title=Nomination Database - Physiology or Medicine|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/nomination/nomination.php?action=simplesearch&string=Noguchi&start=1|work=nobelprize.org Nomination Database|publisher=Nobel Media|accessdate=7 August 2011}}</ref>

While working at the [[Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research]] in 1911, he was accused of inoculating orphan children with syphilis.<ref>BASELESS CHARGE AGAINST DR. NOGUCHI; Libel Action May Arise Out of a Charge by the Anti-Vivisectionists. http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50712FB3E5813738DDDA80A94DD405B828DF1D3</ref> Although he was acquitted of any wrongdoing, this is considered to be an early instance of [[unethical human experimentation in the United States|unethical human experimentation]].<ref>Hideyo Noguchi's Luetin Experiment and the Antivivisectionists. Susan Eyrich Lederer Isis Vol. 76, No. 1 (Mar., 1985), pp. 31-48 http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/232791?uid=3739832&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21101605085737</Ref>

In 1913, he demonstrated the presence of ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' (syphilitic spirochete) in the brain of a progressive paralysis patient, proving that the spirochete was the cause of the disease.  Dr. Noguchi's name is remembered in the binomial attached to another spirochete, ''Leptospira noguchii''.<ref>Dixon, Bernard. [http://forms.asm.org/microbe/index.asp?bid=27061  "Fame, Failure, and Yellowjack,"] ''Microbe Magazine'' ([[American Society for Microbiology]]). May 2004.</ref>

In 1918, Noguchi traveled extensively in [[Central America]] and [[South America]] to do research for a [[vaccine]] for [[yellow fever]], and to research [[Oroya fever]], [[poliomyelitis]] and [[trachoma]]. He believed that yellow fever was caused by [[spirochaete]] [[bacteria]] instead of a [[virus]], and spent much of the next ten years attempting to prove this theory. His work on yellow fever was widely criticized as taking an inaccurate approach which was contradicting contemporary research, and confusing yellow fever with other pathogens. In 1927-28 three different papers appeared in medical journals which discredited his theories.<ref name="kantha">SS Kantha. "[http://www1.gifu-u.ac.jp/~srikanth/srikantha_library/file/History%20of%20science/Kitasato%20Arch%201989%20p1-9.pdf Hideyo Noguchi's Research on Yellow Fever (1918-1928) In The Pre-Electron Microscope Era]". ''Kitasato Arch. of Exp. Med.'', 62.1 (1989), pp.1-9</ref> Happily, it turned out he had confused yellow fever with [[leptospirosis]], and his "yellow fever" vaccine was successfully used to treat the latter disease.

==Death==
In 1928, Noguchi traveled to [[Africa]] in an attempt to prove his findings about yellow fever. While working in [[Accra]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (modern-day [[Ghana]]) he died from [[yellow fever]] on May 21, 1928,<ref>{{cite news |first= Wireless|last= To|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dr. Noguchi is Dead, Martyr of Science.

==Impact==
While Noguchi was famous during his lifetime, later research was not able to reproduce many of his claims including having discovered the causes of polio, rabies, syphilis, trachoma, and yellow fever.<ref>{{cite book |author=Grant J |title=Corrupted Science| publisher= Facts, Figures & Fun, 2007 |isbn=978-1-904332-73-2 |page=43}}</ref>  His finding that ''Noguchia granulosis'' causes trachoma was questioned within a year of his death, and overturned shortly thereafter.<ref>Beret E.

''Tom Rivers: reflections on a life in medicine and science: an oral history memoir''. M.I.T. Press, 1967. pp.95-98.</ref> Noguchi's frequent failures have often been attributed to his tendency to work in isolation without the skeptical eye of fellow researchers.<ref>Wilson 1959, p. 9.</ref><ref name="kantha"/> The Rockefeller Institute's flawed system of peer review is also a frequent subject of criticism.<ref>Isabel Rosanoff Plesset, ''Noguchi and his patrons''</ref>

Noguchi's most famous contribution is his identification of the causative agent of syphillis (the bacteria Treponema pallidimn) in the brain tissues of patients suffering from partial paralysis due to meningoencephalitis. Other lasting contributions include the use of snake venom in serums, the identification of the [[leishmaniasis]] pathogen and of [[Carrion's disease]] with Oroya fever. His claim to have grown a culture of syphilis has proven [[Reproducibility|irreproducible]].<ref>[http://www.cao.go.jp/noguchisho/doc/academic-achievements-e.pdf Dr. Hideyo Noguchi’s Academic Achievements and Contribution to Africa]</ref>

==Honors during Noguchi's lifetime==

[[File:1000 yen banknote 2004.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Hideyo Noguchi on 1000 yen banknote]]
Noguchi was honored with both Japanese and foreign decorations.  He received honorary degrees from a number of universities.

==Human experimentation==
In 1911 and 1912 at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City, Noguchi was working to develop a syphilis skin test similar to the tuberculin skin test. The subjects were recruited from clinics and hospitals in New York. In the experiment, Noguchi injected an extract of syphilis called luetin under the subjects' upper arm skin. Skin reactions varied among healthy subjects and syphilis patients by the disease's stage and its treatment. Of the 571 subjects, 315 had syphilis. The remaining subjects were "controls" who did not have syphilis and were orphans or hospital patients. The hospital patients had nonsyphilitic diseases, such as malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. Finally, of the controls, were normal individuals, mostly children between the ages of 2 and 18 years. Critics at the time noted that Noguchi violated the rights of orphans and hospital patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Noguchi H | year = 1912 | title = Experimental research in syphilis with especial reference to Spirochaeta pallida (Treponema pallidum) | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 58 | issue = 16| pages = 1163–1172 }}</ref><ref>Lederer SE.

In Noguchi's defense, Rockefeller Institute business manager [[Jerome D. Greene]] wrote a letter to the anti-[[vivisection]] society which had protested the experiment. Greene pointed out that Noguchi had tested the extract on himself before administering it to subjects, and his fellow researchers had done the same. Nevertheless, in May 1912 the New York Society for the Prevention for Cruelty to Children asked the New York district attorney to press charges against Noguchi; he declined.<ref>Susan E. Lederer.
