'''Hypertriglyceridemia''' denotes high (''hyper-'') blood levels (''-emia'') of [[triglyceride]]s, the most abundant [[fat]]ty molecule in most organisms. Elevated levels of triglycerides are associated with [[atherosclerosis]], even in the absence of [[hypercholesterolemia]] (high [[cholesterol]] levels), and predispose to [[cardiovascular disease]]. Very high triglyceride levels also increase the risk of [[acute pancreatitis]]. Hypertriglyceridemia itself is usually symptomless, although high levels may be associated with skin lesions known as ''[[xanthoma]]s''.<ref name=CPG2012/>

The diagnosis is made on [[blood test]]s, often performed as part of [[Screening (medicine)|screening]]. Once diagnosed, other blood tests are usually required to determine whether the raised triglyceride level is caused by other underlying disorders ("secondary hypertriglyceridemia") or whether no such underlying cause exists ("primary hypertriglyceridaemia"). There is a hereditary predisposition to both primary and secondary hypertriglyceridemia.<ref name=CPG2012/>

Weight loss and dietary modification may be effective in hypertriglyceridemia. The decision to treat hypertriglyceridemia with medication depends on the levels and on the presence of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Very high levels that would increase the risk of pancreatitis is treated with a drug from the [[fibrate]] class. [[Niacin]] and [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s as well as drugs from the [[statin]] class may be used in conjunction, with statins being the main drug treatment for moderate hypertriglyceridemia where reduction of cardiovascular risk is required.<ref name=CPG2012/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Most people with elevated triglycerides experience no symptoms. Some forms of primary hypertriglyceridemia can lead to specific symptoms: both familial chylomicronemia and primary [[Combined hyperlipidemia|mixed hyperlipidemia]] include skin symptoms (eruptive [[xanthoma]]), eye abnormalities (lipemia retinalis), [[hepatosplenomegaly]] (enlargement of the [[liver]] and [[spleen]]), and neurological symptoms. Some experience attacks of abdominal pain that may be mild episodes of pancreatitis. Eruptive xanthomas are 2-5&nbsp;mm papules, often with a red ring around them, that occur in clusters on the skin of the trunk, buttocks and extremities.<ref name=Yuan2007>{{cite journal |author=Yuan G, Al-Shali KZ, Hegele RA |title=Hypertriglyceridemia: its etiology, effects and treatment |journal=CMAJ |volume=176 |issue=8 |pages=1113–20 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17420495 |pmc=1839776 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.060963 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/176/8/1113.full}}</ref> [[Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia]] causes larger, tuberous xanthomas; these are red or orange and occur on the elbows and knees.

[[Acute pancreatitis]] occurs in people whose triglyceride levels are above 1000&nbsp;mg/dl (11.3&nbsp;mmol/l).<ref name=CPG2012/><ref name=Yuan2007/><ref name=Tsuang2009>{{cite journal |author=Tsuang W, Navaneethan U, Ruiz L, Palascak JB, Gelrud A |title=Hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis: presentation and management |journal=Am.

==Causes==
{{unsourced-section|date=September 2012}}

*High [[carbohydrate]] diet 
*[[Idiopathic]] (constitutional)
*[[Obesity]]
*[[Diabetes mellitus]] and [[insulin resistance]] - it is one of the defined components of [[metabolic syndrome]] (along with [[central obesity]], [[hypertension]], and [[hyperglycemia]])
*Excess [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] intake
*[[renal failure]], [[Nephrotic syndrome]]
* Genetic predisposition; some forms of familial [[hyperlipidemia]] such as familial [[combined hyperlipidemia]] i.e. Type II hyperlipidemia
*[[Lipoprotein lipase deficiency]] - Deficiency of this water soluble [[enzyme]], that hydrolyzes [[triglyceride]]s in [[lipoprotein]]s, leads to elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood.
* [[Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency]] or [[Cholesteryl ester storage disease]]
* Certain medications e.g. [[isotretinoin]], [[estrogen]], [[hydrochlorothiazide]] diuretics, [[beta blockers]], [[protease inhibitors]]
* [[Hypothyroidism]] (underactive thyroid)
* [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus]]
* Glycogen storage disease type 1.

==Treatment==
{{expand-section|date=September 2012}}
For people with mildly or moderately high levels of triglycerides lifestyle changes are recommended.<ref name=CPG2012/> This may include restriction of carbohydrates and fat in the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. Medications are recommended in those with high levels of triglycerides, with [[fibrate]]s being recommended first.<ref name=CPG2012/>
