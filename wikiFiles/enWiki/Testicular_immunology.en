Testicular Immunology is the study of the [[immune system]] within the [[testis]]. It includes an investigation of the effects of [[infection]], [[inflammation]] and immune factors on testicular function. Two unique characteristics of '''testicular immunology''' are evident: (1) the testis is described as an [[immunologically privileged site]], where suppression of immune responses occurs; and, (2) some factors which normally lead to inflammation are present at high levels in the testis, where they regulate the development of [[sperm]]  instead of promoting inflammation.

==Immune cells found in the testis==

Immune cells of the human testis are not as well characterized as those from rodents, due to the rarity of normal human testes available for experiment. The majority of experiments have studied the rat testis due to its convenience: it is a relatively large size and is easily extracted from experimental animals.

=== Macrophages ===
[[Macrophages]] are directly involved in the fight against invading micro-organisms as well as being [[antigen-presenting cells]] which activate [[lymphocytes]].

=== B-Lymphocytes ===
[[B-lymphocytes]] take part in the [[adaptive immune response]] and produce antibodies. These cells are not normally found in the testis, even during inflammatory conditions. The lack of B-lymphocytes in the testis is significant, since these are the antibody-producing cells of the immune system. Since anti-sperm antibodies can cause infertility, it is important that antibody-producing B-lymphocytes are kept separated from the testis.

=== T-lymphocytes ===
[[T-lymphocytes]] (T-cells) are white blood cells which take part in cell-mediated immunity. They are often found within tissues where they can be activated by antigen-presenting cells upon infection. They are present in rat <ref name=HedgerMP>{{cite journal |author=Hedger MP, Meinhardt A |title=Local regulation of T cell numbers and lymphocyte-inhibiting activity in the interstitial tissue of the adult rat testis |journal=J Reprod Immunol. |volume=48 |pages=69–80 |year=2000 |pmid=11011073 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(00)00071-1 |issue=2}}</ref><ref name=Pollanena>{{cite journal |doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0820437 |author=Pöllänen P, Maddocks S|title=Macrophages, lymphocytes and MHC II antigen in the ram and the rat testis |journal=J Reprod Fertil. |volume=82 |pages=437–445 |year=1988 |pmid=3163001 |issue=2}}</ref> and human testes,<ref name=Pollanenb>{{cite journal |author=Pöllänen P, Niemi M |title=Immunohistochemical identification of macrophages, lymphoid cells and HLA antigens in the human testis |journal=Int J Androl. |volume=10 |pages=37–42 |year=1987 |pmid=3294605 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2605.1987.tb00163.x |issue=1}}</ref> where they constitute approximately 10 to 20% of the immune cells present, as well as mouse <ref name=elDemiry>{{cite journal |author=el-Demiry M, James K |title=Lymphocyte subsets and macrophages in the male genital tract in health and disease.

=== Mast cells ===
[[Mast cells]] are regulators of immune responses, particularly those against [[parasitism|parasites]]. They are also involved in the development of [[autoimmune diseases]] and [[allergy|allergies]]. Mast cells have been found in relatively low numbers in the testes of humans, rats, mice, dogs, cats, bulls, boars and deer.<ref name=Anton>{{cite journal |author=Anton F, Morales C, Aguilar R, Bellido C, Aguilar E, Gaytán F |title=A comparative study of mast cells and eosinophil leukocytes in the mammalian testis |journal= Zentralbl Veterinarmed A. |volume=45 |pages=209–218 |year=1998 |pmid=9697421 |issue=4 }}</ref><ref name=Fijak>{{cite journal |author=Fijak M, Meinhardt A |title=The testis in immune privilege |journal= Immunol Rev. |volume=213 |pages=66–81 |year=2006 |pmid=16972897 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00438.x }}</ref> In the mammalian testis mast cells regulate testosterone production.<ref name=Fijak/> There are two lines of evidence that restriction of mast cell activation in the testis could be beneficial during treatment of inflammatory conditions; (1) In experimental models of testicular inflammation, mast cells were present in 10-fold greater numbers and showed signs of activation,<ref name=Iosub>{{cite journal |author=Iosub R, Klug J, Fijak M, Schneider E, Fröhlich S, Blumbach K, Wennemuth G, Sommerhoff CP, Steinhoff M, Meinhardt A |title=Development of testicular inflammation in the rat involves activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 |journal= J Pathol. |volume=208 |pages=686–698 |year=2006 |pmid=16450334 |doi=10.1002/path.1938 |issue=5 }}</ref> and (2) Treatment with drugs which stabilize mast cell activation has proved beneficial in treating some types of male infertility.<ref name=Yamamoto>{{cite journal |author=Yamamoto M, Hibi H, Miyake K |title=New treatment of idiopathic severe oligozoospermia with mast cell blocker: results of a single-blind study |journal= Fertil Steril. |volume=64 |pages=1221–1223 |year=1995 |pmid=7589684 |issue=6 }}</ref><ref name=Hibi>{{cite journal |author=Hibi H, Kato K, Mitsui K, Taki T, Yamada Y, Honda N, Fukatsu H, Yamamoto M |title=Treatment of oligoasthenozoospermia with tranilast, a mast cell blocker, after long-term administration |journal= Arch Androl. |volume=48 |pages=415–419 |year=2002 |pmid=12425762 |issue=6 |doi=10.1080/01485010290099200  }}</ref><ref name=Matsuki>{{cite journal |author=Matsuki S, Sasagawa I, Suzuki Y, Yazawa H, Tateno T, Hashimoto T, Nakada T, Saito H, Hiroi M. |title=The use of ebastine, a mast cell blocker, for treatment of oligozoospermia |journal= Arch Androl. |volume=44 |pages=129–132 |year=2000 |pmid=10746869 |doi=10.1080/014850100262290 |issue=5 }}</ref>

=== Eosinophils ===
[[Eosinophils]] directly fight parasitic infections and are involved in allergic reactions. They have been found in relatively low numbers in the rat, mouse, dog, cat, bull and deer testes.<ref name=Anton/> Almost nothing is known about their significance or function in the testis.

===Neutrophils===
[[Neutrophils]] are white blood cells which are present in the blood but not normally in tissues. They move out from the blood into tissues and organs upon infection or damage. They directly fight invading pathogens such as bacteria. Neutrophils are not found in the rodent testis under normal conditions but can enter from the blood supply upon infection or inflammatory stimulus. This has been demonstrated in the rat after injection with bacterial cell wall components to produce an immune reaction.<ref name="O'Bryan">{{cite journal |author=O'Bryan MK, Schlatt S, Phillips DJ, de Kretser DM, Hedger MP. |title= Bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation compromises testicular function at multiple levels ''in vivo'' |journal= Endocrinology |volume=141 |pages=238–246 |year=2000 |pmid=10614644 |doi= 10.1210/en.141.1.238 |issue=1 }}</ref> Neutrophils also enter the rat testis after treatment with hormones that increase the permeability of blood vessels.<ref name=Berghb>{{cite journal |author=Bergh A, Widmark A, Damber JE, Cajander S.|title= Are leukocytes involved in the human chorionic gonadotropin-induced increase in testicular vascular permeability? |journal= Endocrinology |volume=119 |pages=589–590 |year=1986 |pmid=3732138 |issue=2 |doi=10.1210/endo-119-2-586}}</ref> In humans, neutrophils have been found in the testis when associated with some tumors.<ref name=Akhtar>{{cite journal |author=Akhtar M, al-Dayel F, Siegrist K, Ezzat A |title=Neutrophil-rich Ki-1-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma presenting as a testicular mass |journal= Mol Pathol |volume=9 |pages=812–815 |year=1996 |pmid=8871921 |issue=8  }}</ref> In rat experiments, [[testicular torsion]] leads to neutrophil entry into the testis.<ref name=Lysiak>{{cite journal |author=Lysiak JJ |title= The role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 in the mammalian testis and their involvement in testicular torsion and autoimmune orchitis |journal= Reprod Biol Endocrinol |volume=2 |pages=9 |year=2004 |pmid=15012831 |doi= 10.1186/1477-7827-2-9 |pmc=404472 }}</ref> Neutrophil activity in the testis is an inflammatory response which needs to be tightly regulated by the body, since inflammation-induced damage to the testis can lead to infertility.<ref name=Adamopoulos>{{cite journal |author=Adamopoulos DA, Lawrence DM, Vassilopoulos P, Contoyiannis PA, Swyer GI |title= Pituitary-testicular interrelationships in mumps orchitis and other viral infections |journal= Histopathology |volume=6 |pages=1177–1180 |year=1978 |pmid=346165 |issue=6121 |pmc=1604202 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.6121.1177}}</ref><ref name=Wallgren>{{cite journal |author=Wallgren M, Kindahl H, Larsson K |title= Clinical, endocrinological and spermatological studies after endotoxin in the ram |journal= Zentralbl Veterinarmed A. |volume=36 |pages=90–103 |year=1989 |pmid=2501956 |issue=2 }}</ref> It is assumed that the role of the immunosuppressive environment of the testis is to protect developing sperm from inflammation.

==Immune privilege in the testis==

Sperm are immunogenic - that is they will cause an autoimmune reaction if transplanted from the testis into a different part of the body. This has been demonstrated in experiments using rats by Lansteiner (1899) and Metchinikoff (1900),<ref name="HedgerBook"/><ref name=Fijak/> mice <ref name=Kohno>{{cite journal |author=Kohno S, Munoz JA, Williams TM, Teuscher C, Bernard CC, Tung KS. |title=Immunopathology of murine experimental allergic orchitis |journal= J Immunol. |volume=130 |pages=2675–2682 |year=1983 |pmid=6682874 |issue=6 }}</ref> and guinea pigs.<ref name=Teuscher>{{cite journal |author=Teuscher C, Wild GC, Tung KS |title=Immunochemical analysis of guinea pig sperm autoantigens |journal= Biol reprod. |volume=26 |pages=218–229 |year=1982 |pmid=7039703 |doi=10.1095/biolreprod26.2.218 |issue=2 }}</ref> The likely reason for this is that sperm first mature at puberty, after [[immune tolerance]] is established, therefore the body recognizes them as foreign and mounts an immune reaction against them. Therefore, mechanisms for their protection must exist in this organ to prevent any autoimmune reaction. The [[blood-testis barrier]] is likely to contribute to the survival of sperm. However, it is believed in the field of testicular immunology that the blood-testis barrier cannot account for all immune suppression in the testis, due to (1) its incompleteness at a region called the [[rete testis]] <ref name=Fijak/> and (2) the presence of immunogenic molecules outside the blood-testis barrier, on the surface of [[spermatogonia]].<ref name="HedgerBook"/><ref name=Fijak/>  Another mechanism which is likely to protect sperm is the suppression of immune responses in the testis.<ref name=Kern/><ref name="O'Bryana">{{cite journal |author=O'Bryan MK, Gerdprasert O, Nikolic-Paterson DJ, Meinhardt A, Muir JA, Foulds LM, Phillips DJ, de Kretser DM, Hedger MP |title=Cytokine profiles in the testes of rats treated with lipopolysaccharide reveal localized suppression of inflammatory responses |journal=Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol. |volume=288 |pages=R1744–R1755 |year=2005 |pmid=15661966 |issue=6 |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00651.2004}}</ref> Both the suppression of immune responses and the increased survival of grafts in the testis have led to its recognition as an [[immunologically privileged site]].

The two main features of immune privilege in the rat testis are;
* a diminishment in the activation of testicular macrophages by infections such as bacteria,<ref name=Kern/><ref name="O'Bryana" /> and
* a defect in the activation of T-cells when antigen is presented to them, leading to the absence of an [[adaptive immune response]] to sperm in the testis.<ref name=Fijak/>{{Additional citation needed|date=September 2011}}
It is also predicted that the high level of inflammatory [[cytokines]] in the testis contributes to immune privilege.<ref name=Fijak/>

===Immune privilege in rodents and other experimental animals===

===How does the testis suppress immune responses?===

How the testicular environment suppresses the immune response is only partially understood. Recent experiments have uncovered a number of biological processes that most likely contribute to immune privilege in the testes of rodents:
* 1.  Experiments in the rat have shown that [[Sertoli cells]] can help protect from graft rejection. These cells were isolated from the testis, then added to transplants of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas ([[islets of Langerhans]]), resulting in increased graft survival.<ref name=Korbutt>{{cite journal |author=Korbutt GS, Elliott JF, Rajotte RV |title=Cotransplantation of allogeneic islets with allogeneic testicular cell aggregates allows long-term graft survival without systemic immunosuppression |journal= Diabetes |volume=46 |pages=317–322 |year=1997 |pmid=9000711 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.46.2.317 |issue=2 }}</ref> Molecules released by the Sertoli cells are predicted to protect the graft.<ref name=Selawry/>
* 2.  It is likely that the testicular environment itself is inhibiting the activation of T-cells, in order to protect the developing sperm which are immunogenic.<ref name=Hedgerc>{{cite journal |author=Hedger, MP, Meinhardt, A |title=Local regulation of T cell numbers and lymphocyte-inhibiting activity in the interstitial tissue of the adult rat testis |journal= J Reprod Immunol. |volume=48 |pages=69–80 |year=2000 |pmid=11011073 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(00)00071-1 |issue=2}}</ref><ref name=Kerna>{{cite journal |author=Kern S, Maddocks S. |title=Indomethacin blocks the immunosuppressive activity of rat testicular macrophages cultured in vitro |journal= J Reprod Immunol. |volume=28 |pages=189–201 |year=1995 |pmid=7473430 |doi=10.1016/0165-0378(95)91391-Q |issue=3}}</ref> The fluid present in the testis is a potent inhibitor of the activation of T-cells under laboratory conditions.<ref name=Hedgerc/>
* 3.  The diminishment of the testis inflammatory response is likely to result from relatively low levels of inflammatory cytokines released by activated testicular macrophages.<ref name=Kern/><ref name="O'Bryana" />

Since protection of developing sperm is so important to the survival of a species, it would not be surprising if more than one mechanism were in use.

==Immune factors regulate normal testis function==

Curiously, the testis contains factors such as [[cytokines]], which are usually only produced upon infections and tissue damage. The cytokines interleukin-1α ([[Interleukin 1|IL-1]]α), [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] and [[Activin]] A are found in the testis, often at high levels.<ref name=Gustafsson>{{cite journal |author=Gustafsson K, Sultana T, Zetterström CK, Setchell BP, Siddiqui A, Weber G, Söder O |title=Production and secretion of interleukin-1alpha proteins by rat testis|journal= Biochem Biophys Res Commun. |volume=297 |pages=492–497 |year=2002 |pmid=12270120 |doi=10.1016/S0006-291X(02)02239-8 |issue=3 }}</ref><ref name=Syed>{{cite journal |author=Syed V, Gérard N, Kaipia A, Bardin CW, Parvinen M, Jégou B |title=Identification, ontogeny, and regulation of an interleukin-6-like factor in the rat seminiferous tubule |journal= Endocrinology |volume=132 |pages=293–299 |year=1993 |pmid=8380379 |doi=10.1210/en.132.1.293 |issue=1 }}</ref><ref name=Gerard>{{cite journal |author=Gérard N, Syed V, Bardin W, Genetet N, Jégou B. |title=Sertoli cells are the site of interleukin-1 alpha synthesis in rat testis |journal= Mol Cell Endocrinol. |volume=82 |pages=R13–R16 |year=1991 |pmid=7588293 |doi=10.1016/0303-7207(91)90019-O |issue=1}}</ref><ref name=Lee>{{cite journal |author=Lee W, Mason AJ, Schwall R, Szonyi E, Mather JP |title=Secretion of activin by interstitial cells in the testis |journal= Science |volume=243 |pages=396–398 |year=1989 |pmid=2492117 |doi=10.1126/science.2492117 |issue=4889}}</ref><ref name=deKretser>{{cite journal |author=de Kretser DM, Robertson DM |title=The isolation and physiology of inhibin and related proteins |journal= Biol Reprod. |volume=40 |pages=33–47 |year=1989 |pmid=2493821 |doi=10.1095/biolreprod40.1.33 |issue=1 }}</ref> In other tissues, these cytokine would promote inflammation, but here they control testis function.

Further research is required to define the functional roles of these immune factors in the testis.

==The effects of infections and immune responses on the testis==
===Mumps===

[[Mumps]] is a viral disease which causes swelling of the salivary glands and testes. The mumps virus lives in the upper respiratory tract and spreads through direct contact with saliva.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/mumps/in-short-adult.htm]''Mumps In-Short''.</ref> Prior to widespread vaccination programs, it was a common childhood disease. Mumps is generally not serious in children, but in adults, where sperm have matured in the testis, it can cause more severe complications, such as infertility.

===Sexually transmitted diseases===

[[Gonorrhea]] is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacteria ''Niesseria gonorrhea'' which can lead to testicular pain and swelling. Gonorrhea also infects the female reproductive system around the cervix and uterus, and can grow in the mouth, throat, eyes and anus.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/std/Gonorrhea/STDFact-gonorrhea.htm]''Gonorrhea - CDC Fact Sheet''.</ref> It can be effectively treated with antibiotics, however, if untreated, gonorrhea can cause infertility in men. [[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]] is caused by the sexually transmitted bacteria ''Chlamydia trachomatis'' which infects the genitals. It more commonly affects women, and if untreated, can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/STDFact-Chlamydia.htm]''Chlamydia - CDC Fact Sheet''.</ref> Serious symptoms in men are rare, but include swollen testicles and an unusual discharge from the penis. It is effectively treated with antibiotics.

===Anti-sperm antibodies===

Anti-sperm antibodies are produced by cells of the [[adaptive immune system]] and are the cause of approximately 7% of male infertility incidences. They can bind to sperm, inhibiting their movement, stopping recognition and entry into the egg, or targeting sperm for destruction when they reach the female reproductive tract <ref name=Hendry>{{cite journal |author=Hendry, WF |title=Detection and treatment of antispermatozoal antibodies in men|journal= Reprod Fertil Dev. |volume=1 |pages=205–220 |year=1989 |pmid=2682806 |doi=10.1071/RD9890205 |issue=3}}</ref><ref name=Kremer>{{cite journal |author=Kremer J, Jager S.|title=The significance of antisperm antibodies for sperm-cervical mucus interaction|journal= Autoimmunity |volume=7 |pages=781–784 |year=1992 |pmid=1500475 |issue=6}}</ref>

===Testicular torsion===

[[Testicular torsion]] is a condition of physical twisting of the testis which results in cutting off the blood supply. It leads to damage that, if not treated within a few hours, causes the death of testicular tissue, and requires removal of the testis to prevent [[gangrene]], and therefore can cause infertility.<ref name=Ringdahl>{{cite journal |author= Ringdahl E, Teague L.|title=Testicular torsion |journal= Am Fam Physician. |volume=74 |pages=1739–1743 |year=2006 |pmid=17137004 |issue= 10}}</ref>

===Autoimmune orchitis===

[[Orchitis]] is a condition of testicular pain involving swelling, inflammation and possibly infection. Orchitis can be caused by an [[autoimmune reaction]] (autoimmune orchitis) leading to a reduction in fertility. Autoimmune orchitis is rare in humans, compared to anti-sperm antibodies.<ref name="HedgerBook"/> To study orchitis in the testis, autoimmune orchitis has been induced in the rodent testis. The disease starts with the appearance of testicular antibodies, then movement of [[macrophages]] and [[lymphocytes]] from the blood stream into the testis, breaking of the physical interactions between the developing sperm and [[Sertoli cells]], entry of [[neutrophils]] or [[eosinophils]], and finally death of the developing sperm, leading to infertility.<ref name=Kohno>{{cite journal |author=Kohno S, Munoz JA, Williams TM, Teuscher C, Bernard CC, Tung KS |title= Immunopathology of murine experimental allergic orchitis|journal= J Immunol. |volume=130 |pages=2675–2682 |year=1983 |pmid=6682874 |issue=6 }}</ref><ref name=Doncel>{{cite journal |author= Doncel GF, Di Paola JA, Lustig L |title=Sequential study of the histopathology and cellular and humoral immune response during the development of an autoimmune orchitis in Wistar rats |journal= Am J Reprod Immunol |volume=20 |pages=44–51 |year=1989 |pmid=2803528 |issue= 2 }}</ref><ref name=Zhou>{{cite journal |author=Zhou ZZ, Zheng Y, Steenstra R, Hickey WF, Teuscher C |title=Actively-induced experimental allergic orchitis (EAO) in Lewis/NCR rats: sequential histo- and immunopathologic analysis|journal= Autoimmunity |volume=3 |pages=125–134 |year=1989 |pmid=2491624 |doi=10.3109/08916938909019961 |issue=2 }}</ref>

===Inflammation models in the rodent===

Experiments in rats have examined, in fine detail, the course of testicular events during a bacterial infection. In the short term (3 hours) multiple inflammatory factors are produced and released by testicular [[macrophages]]. Examples are [[prostaglandin E2]],<ref name=Kern>{{cite journal |author=Kern S, Maddocks S |title=Indomethacin blocks the immunosuppressive activity of rat testicular macrophages cultured ''in vitro'' |journal= J Reprod Immunol. |volume=28 |pages=189–201 |year=1995 |pmid=7473430 |doi=10.1016/0165-0378(95)91391-Q |issue=3 }}</ref><ref name=Winnall/> inducible [[nitric oxide synthase]] (iNOS),<ref name="O'Bryan" /><ref name=Gerdprasert>{{cite journal |author=Gerdprasert O, O'Bryan MK, Muir JA, Caldwell AM, Schlatt S, de Kretser DM, Hedger MP |title= The response of testicular leukocytes to lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation: further evidence for heterogeneity of the testicular macrophage population |journal= Cell Tiss Res. |volume=308 |pages=277–285 |year=2002 |pmid=12037584 |doi= 10.1007/s00441-002-0547-6 |issue=2 }}</ref> TNFα<ref name=Hutson>{{cite journal |author=Hutson JC |title= Secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha by testicular macrophages |journal= J Reprod Immunol. |volume=23 |pages=63–72 |year=1993 |pmid=8429525 |doi= 10.1016/0165-0378(93)90027-F |issue=1 }}</ref> and IL-1β, although at lower levels than other tissues.<ref name=Kern/><ref name="O'Bryana" /> Non-immune cells of the testis such as  [[Sertoli cells]] and [[Leydig cells]] also able to respond to bacteria.<ref name=Syed/><ref name=Gerardb>{{cite journal |author=Gérard N, Syed V, Jégou B |title=Lipopolysaccharide, latex beads and residual bodies are potent activators of Sertoli cell interleukin-1 alpha production |journal= Biochem Biophys Res Commun. |volume=185 |pages=154–161 |year=1992 |pmid=1599451 |doi=10.1016/S0006-291X(05)80969-6 |issue=1 }}</ref> During a bacterial infection, testosterone levels and the amount of testicular [[interstitial fluid]] are reduced.<ref name="O'Bryan" /> Neutrophils enter the testis about 12 hours after infection.<ref name="O'Bryan" /> Importantly, there is damage to the developing sperm, which start to die under severe infections.<ref name="O'Bryan" /><ref name=Liew>{{cite journal |author= Liew SH, Meachem SJ, Hedger MP |title= A stereological analysis of the response of spermatogenesis to an acute inflammatory episode in adult rats |journal= J Androl |volume=28 |pages=176–185 |year=2007 |pmid=16988326 |doi= 10.2164/jandrol.106.000752 |issue= 1 }}</ref> Despite all the data on the effects of bacteria on normal testis parameters, there is little experimental data regarding its effect on rodent fertility.
