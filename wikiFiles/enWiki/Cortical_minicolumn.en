A '''cortical minicolumn''' is a [[cortical column|vertical column]] through the [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] layers of the brain, comprising perhaps 80&ndash;120 [[neuron]]s, except in the [[primate]] [[striate cortex|primary visual cortex]] (V1), where there are typically more than twice the number.  There are about 2×10<sup>8</sup> minicolumns in humans.<ref name="Towards cortex sized artificial neural systems">Towards cortex sized artificial neural systems, Christopher Johansson and Anders Lansner, ''Neural Networks'', Vol. 20 #1, pp48–61, Elsevier, January 2007</ref> From calculations, the diameter of a minicolumn is about 28–40&nbsp;µm.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Minicolumns grow from [[progenitor cell]]s within the embryo and contain neurons within multiple layers (2 - 6) of the cortex.<ref>Jeff Hawkins, Sandra Blakeslee "On Intelligence" p. 94</ref>

Many sources support the existence of minicolumns, especially [[Vernon Mountcastle|Mountcastle]],<ref>The columnar organization of the neocortex, Vernon B. Mountcastle, ''Brain'', Vol. 20 #4, pp701–722, Oxford University Press, April 1997</ref> with strong evidence reviewed by Buxhoeveden and Casanova<ref>The minicolumn hypothesis in neuroscience, Daniel P. Buxhoeveden and Manuel F. Casanova, ''Brain'', Vol. 125 #5, pp935–951, Oxford University Press, May 2002.</ref> who conclude "...  the minicolumn must be considered a strong model for cortical organization" and "<nowiki>[the minicolumn is]</nowiki> the most basic and consistent template by which the neocortex organizes its neurones, pathways, and intrinsic circuits".  See also [http://williamcalvin.com/1990s/1995Handbook.htm Calvin's Handbook] on cortical columns.

Cortical minicolumns can also be called '''cortical microcolumns'''.<ref>http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~ccruz/micros/index.html</ref> Cells in 50&nbsp;µm minicolumn all have the same receptive field; adjacent minicolumns may have very different fields (Jones, 2000). 

==Size==
The minicolumn measures of the order of 40–50&nbsp;µm in transverse diameter (Mountcastle 1997, Buxhoeveden 2000, 2001); 35–60&nbsp;µm (Schlaug, 1995, Buxhoeveden 1996, 2000, 2001); 50&nbsp;µm with 80&nbsp;µm spacing (Buldyrev, 2000), or 30&nbsp;µm with 50&nbsp;µm (Buxhoeveden, 2000).  Larger sizes may not be of human minicolumns, for example Macaque monkey V1 minicolumns are 31&nbsp;µm diameter, with 142 pyramidal cells (Peters, 1994) — 1270 columns per mm<sup>2</sup>.  Similarly, the cat V1 has much bigger minicolumns, ~56&nbsp;µm (Peters 1991, 1993) .

The size can also be calculated from area considerations: if cortex (both hemispheres) is 1.27×10<sup>11</sup> µm<sup>2</sup> then if there are 2×10<sup>8</sup> minicolumns in the cortex then each is 635&nbsp;µm<sup>2</sup>, giving a diameter of 28&nbsp;µm (if the cortex area were doubled to the commonly quoted value, this would rise to 40&nbsp;µm).  Johansson and Lansner<ref name="Towards cortex sized artificial neural systems"/> do a similar calculation and arrive at 36&nbsp;µm (p51, last para).

Downwards projecting axons in minicolumns are ≈10&nbsp;µm in diameter, periodicity and density similar to those within the cortex, but not necessarily coincident (DePhilipe, 1990).
