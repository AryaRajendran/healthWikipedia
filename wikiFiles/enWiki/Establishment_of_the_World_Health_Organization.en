The '''Establishment of the [[World Health Organization]]''' occurred on 7 April 1948, when its new constitution was ratified by a twenty-sixth nation. Its establishment followed a period of discussions and consultation following [[World War II]] and the formation of the [[United Nations]], of which it formed part.

==History==
An international sanitary conference was held in Venice in 1892, prompted in part by the spread of [[Asiatic cholera]] earlier in that century.<ref name="bmj1948"/> The first international organization to cover this area was the [[Pan-American Sanitary Bureau]] in 1902, followed by the ''[[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]]'' in Paris in 1909. The [[League of Nations Health Organization]] was established following the First World War inside the [[League of Nations]] framework, although it did not subsume other health organizations.<ref>{{cite web |title=League of Nations Health Organization |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/health_org_1931.pdf |year=1931 |format=pdf |publisher=League of Nations Information Section, Geneva (digitised by WHO) |accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> These efforts were hampered by the Second World War, during which [[UNRRA]] also played a role in international health initiatives.<ref name="bmj1948"/>

During the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]], references to health had been incorporated into the [[United Nations Charter]] at the request of [[Brazil]]. It similarly passed a declaration that an international health body would be set up, co-authored by Brazil and China.<ref name="shimkin">{{cite journal|title=The World Health Organization |first=Michael B. |last=Shimkin|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=104 |number=2700 |date=27 September 1946 |pages=281–283 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |jstor=1674843}}</ref> The [[India]]n politician [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] also gave his opinion in favour of starting WHO.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1948.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization |page=54|format=PDF|title=Chronicle of the World Health Organization, April 1948|accessdate=18 July 2007}}</ref>

In February 1946, the [[Economic and Social Council of the United Nations]] helped draft the constitution of the new body. The draft constitution began to be signed by representative of 61 countries in June 1946, to come into force when ratified by 26 countries. Until that happened, an Interim Commission of 18 countries would prepare.<ref name="bmj1948">{{cite journal |title=World Health Organization |journal=The British Medical Journal |volume=2 |number=4570 |date=7 August 1948|pages=302–303 |publisher=BMJ Publishing Group |jstor=25364565}}</ref> The use of the word "world", rather than "international", emphasised the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve.<ref name="bmj1948"/> The constitution of WHO was developed from four documents, submitted by the French, British, United States and Yugoslav governments. There was a common consensus that membership should not be limited to members of the United Nations and to this effect other countries were allowed to send observers to the drafting process.<ref name="shimkin"/> The International Health Conference met between 19 June and 22 July 1946, attended by representatives of all 51 members of the UN, 13 non-member countries, 3 [[Allied Commission]] and 10 international organizations. Dr. [[Thomas Parran]] served as president of the conference. The two most discussed issues were the role of the [[Soviet Union]] (which accepted a place) and the integration of other international organizations, which was agreed and would be managed. The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 61 countries by 22 July 1946, which an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' described as "an historic day". It thus became the first specialised agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed.<ref name="shimkin"/> Its constitution formally came into force on the first [[World Health Day]] on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf|format=PDF|title=Chronicle of the World Health Organization, 1947|accessdate=18 July 2007}}</ref> The transfer was authorized by a Resolution of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]].<ref name="UN_ARES61I">{{UN document |docid=A-RES-61(I) |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=1 |resolution_number=61 |accessdate=14 November 2007|title=Establishment of the World Health Organization |date=14 December 1946}}</ref> The ''Office International d'Hygiène Publique'' was incorporated into the Interim Commission of the World Health Organization on 1 January 1947.<ref name="iriye2002">{{Cite book|last=Iriye|first=Akira|title=Global Community: The Role of International Organizations in the Making of the Contemporary World|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=2002|isbn=052023179}}</ref>

The first meeting [[World Health Assembly]] finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of US$5&nbsp;million (then GBP£1,250,000) for the 1949 year. Dr. [[Andrija Stampar]] was the Assembly's first president, and Dr. [[G. Brock Chisholm]] was appointed Director-General of WHO, having severed as Executive Secretary during the planning stages.<ref name="bmj1948"/> Its first priorities were [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, [[maternal health|maternal]] and [[child health]], nutrition and environmental hygiene. Its first legislative act was concerning the compilation of accurate statistics on the spread and morbidity of disease. It pushed quickly to establish five regional offices to complement is central staff in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.<ref name="bmj1948"/> The logo of the World Health Organization features the [[Rod of Asclepius]] as a symbol for healing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.org.ph/ |title=World Health Organization Philippines |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref>
