The '''lipid hypothesis''' was one of two [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] (the other being the [[chronic endothelial injury hypothesis]]) developed in the 1850s to explain the [[pathogenesis]] of [[atherosclerosis]]. It proposes a connection between [[plasma cholesterol level]] and the development of [[coronary heart disease]].

It was proposed by the German [[pathologist]] [[Rudolf Virchow]] in 1856 and suggested that blood [[lipid]] accumulation in arterial walls causes atherosclerosis.<ref name="Virchow">{{cite book | last = Virchow | first = Rudolf | at = Phlogose und Thrombose im Gefäßsystem |chapter=Gesammelte Abhandlungen zur wissenschaftlichen Medizin |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=rsRXAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Gesammelte%20Abhandlungen%22%20%22zur%20wissenschaftlichen%20Medizin%22%201856&pg=RA5-PA47#v=onepage&q=%22Phlogose%22&f=false| work=Vierteljahrschrift für die praktische Heilkunde | publisher = Staatsdruckerei Frankfurt | year = 1856 | location = Germany}}</ref>{{Not in source|date=August 2011}}<!--I do not think the citation is saying what is claimed in the text - this needs a RS saying Virchow suggested or proposed -- which one actually ??? ... --> Since the emergence of [[cardiovascular disease]] as a major cause of death in the Western world in the middle of the 20th century, the lipid hypothesis received greater attention.

==Lipid hypothesis of atherogenesis==
===Early studies and origin===
In 1913, a study by Nikolai Anitschkow showed that feeding rabbits [[cholesterol]] could induce symptoms similar to atherosclerosis, suggesting a role for cholesterol in atherogenesis.<ref name="Anitschkow1">{{cite journal|author= Anitschkow NN, Chatalov S | title = Über experimentelle Cholesterinsteatose und ihre Bedeutung für die Entstehung einiger pathologischer Prozesse | journal = Zentralbl Allg Pathol | date = 1913 | volume = 24 | pages = 1–9}}</ref><ref name="Anitschkow2">{{cite journal|author= Anitschkow NN | title = Über die Veränderungen der Kaninchenaorta bei experimenteller Cholesterinsteatose | journal = Beitr Pathol Anat | date = 1913 | volume = 56 | pages = 379–404}}</ref> In 1951, Duff and McMillian formulated the lipid hypothesis in its modern form in a review which appeared in the ''[[American Journal of Medicine]]''.<ref name="Duff">{{cite journal|author= Duff GL, McMillian GC | title = Pathology of atherosclerosis | journal = Am J Med | date = 1951 | volume = 11 | pages = 92–108 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(51)90011-3|pmid= 14837929|issue= 1}}</ref> One of the best known early modern proponents that [[saturated fat]]s and [[cholesterol]] in the blood are the cause of heart disease was [[Ancel Keys]], whose first paper on the topic was published in 1953,<ref name="Keys1">{{cite journal |author=Keys A |title=Atherosclerosis: a problem in newer public health |journal=Journal of the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=118–39 |year=1953 |pmid=13085148}}</ref> and whose book ''Eat Well and Stay Well'',<ref name="Keys2">{{cite book | last = Keys | first = Ancel | title = Eat Well and Stay Well | publisher = Doubleday | date = 1959 | location = United States | isbn = 0-385-06575-2}}</ref> helped the issue gain popular awareness.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ancel Keys Obituary | publisher = The American Physiological Society | url = http://www.the-aps.org/membership/obituaries/ancel_keys.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-15 }}</ref>

===Scientific consensus===
Since the middle of the 20th century, the lipid hypothesis proposing that [[saturated fat]]s and [[cholesterol]] in the blood are a major factor in cardiovascular disease has been the focus of research seeking to prove or disprove its validity. The interpretation of this research has resulted in the general acceptance of the lipid hypothesis as scientific fact by the end of the century.<ref name="partv"/> While it has attracted controversy, the [[scientific consensus]] was early on in its favor. A survey conducted in 1978 found that a large majority of researchers and practitioners were supportive of the validity of the lipid hypothesis.<ref name="Norum">{{cite journal|author= Norum KR | title = Some present concepts concerning diet and prevention of coronary heart disease. | journal = Nutr Metab | date = 1978 | volume = 22 | pages = 1–7 | pmid = 619310|issue= 1}}</ref> In this survey, 211 prominent researchers in the field were questioned about the association of the plasma cholesterol biomarker and the link of disease to diet. 90% responded with the following answers:

The [[National Institute of Health]] held a consensus development conference reviewing the scientific evidence in 1984, during which a panel of 14 experts unanimously voted "yes" on the questions of whether blood cholesterol was causal and whether reducing it would help to prevent heart disease.<ref name="Steinberg06">{{cite journal|author= Steinberg D | title = An interpretive history of the cholesterol controversy, part IV: The 1984 coronary primary prevention trial ends it - almost | journal = J Lipid Res | date = 2006 | volume = 47 | pages = 1–14 | pmid = 16227628 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.R500014-JLR200|issue= 1}}</ref> The panel concluded:

As of the end of the 1980s, the evidence accumulated through studies resulted in general acceptance of the lipid hypothesis and the rejection of the "cholesterol controversy",<ref name="Steinberg89">{{cite journal|author= Steinberg D | title = The cholesterol controversy is over.

Nowadays, the term "lipid hypothesis" is commonly used by the opponents of the [[scientific consensus]] concerning the role of [[cholesterol]] in [[atherosclerosis]] and [[cardiovascular disease]], such as members of [[The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics]] founded in 2003 by critic [[Uffe Ravnskov]].

===Controversy===
====Cholesterol controversy of atherogenesis====
During the 1970s and 1980s, some researchers and practitioners considered the lipid hypothesis as unverified due to the lack of proof at that time that lowering blood cholesterol levels resulted in decreased risk for atherosclerosis.<ref name="Rifkind">{{cite journal |author=Rifkind B, Levy R |title=Testing the lipid hypothesis. Clinical trials |journal=Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960) |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=80–3 |year=1978 |pmid=619863}}</ref> Some skeptics were questioning its validity by arguing that the studies supporting it were flawed.<ref name="Oliver">{{cite journal |author=Oliver M |title=Lipid lowering and ischaemic heart disease |journal=Acta Med.

A documentary film titled [[Fat Head (documentary)|''Fat Head'']] (2009) covers, in the second half of the movie, the origin and the propagation of  the lipid hypothesis. The film chronicles the claims made by the main proponents of the lipid hypothesis, how their work influenced the nutrition guidelines published by the U.S. government, and the alleged lack of scientifically valid statistical evidence for those claims.

==Other lipid hypotheses==
===Alzheimer's lipid hypothesis and cholesterol controversy===
A new "cholesterol controversy" is emerging out of the research of the pathogenesis of [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD). A "lipid hypothesis of AD" has been proposed that suggests a connection between cholesterol and changes in brain lipids found in Alzheimer-type neuropathology.<ref name="Kivipelto">{{cite journal|author= Kivipelto M, Solomon A, Blennow K, Olsson AG, Winblad B | title = The new cholesterol controversy - a little bit of history repeating? | journal = Acta Neurol Scand | year = 2006 | volume = 114 Suppl 185 | pages = 1–2 | pmid = 16866903|doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0404.2006.00678.x}}</ref>

===Lipid hypothesis of osteoporosis===
The "lipid hypothesis of [[osteoporosis]]" postulates that lipids involved in causing heart disease also contribute to causing osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is characterized by a decrease of [[bone marrow]] cells, or [[osteoblast]]s, and an increase of fat cells, or [[adipocyte]]s. The formation of osteoblasts from preosteoblasts is reduced by oxidized lipids and in mice fed with a high fat diet. Observations from this model suggest that [[LDL]] oxidation products can cause osteoporosis through changing the developmental fate of bone cells leading to a reduced number of osteoblasts and increased numbers of fat cells.<ref name="Parhami">{{cite journal |author=Parhami F, Jackson SM, Tintut Y, Le V, Balucan JP, Territo M, Demer LL |title=Atherogenic diet and minimally oxidized low density lipoprotein inhibit osteogenic and promote adipogenic differentiation of marrow stromal cells |journal= J.

===Lipid hypothesis of cold tolerance===
In [[plant]]s and [[microbe]]s, changes in the lipid composition of [[cell membrane]]s have been linked to cold tolerance.<ref name="Finegold">{{cite journal |author=Finegold L |title=Molecular aspects of adaptation to extreme cold environments |journal=Adv Space Res |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=257–64 |year=1986 |pmid=11537829 |doi=10.1016/0273-1177(86)90094-3}}</ref> The enhanced resistance to cold treatment appears to be caused by an increased amount of fatty acid desaturases produced under cold stress transforming saturated into unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane.
