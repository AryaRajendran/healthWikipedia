'''Rhabdomyolysis''' {{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|r|æ|b|d|ɵ|m|aɪ|ˈ|ɒ|l|ɨ|s|ɪ|s}} is a condition in which damaged [[skeletal muscle]] tissue (Greek: ῥαβδω ''rhabdo-'' striped μυς ''myo-'' muscle) breaks down (Greek: λύσις ''–lysis'') rapidly. Breakdown products of damaged [[muscle fiber|muscle cells]] are released into the bloodstream; some of these, such as the protein [[myoglobin]], are harmful to the [[kidney]]s and may lead to [[acute kidney injury|kidney failure]]. The severity of the symptoms, which may include [[myalgia|muscle pains]], [[vomiting]] and [[mental confusion|confusion]], depends on the extent of muscle damage and whether kidney failure develops. The muscle damage may be caused by physical factors (e.g. [[Crush syndrome|crush injury]], strenuous exercise), [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]], [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]], and [[infection]]s. Some people have a hereditary muscle condition that increases the risk of rhabdomyolysis. The diagnosis is usually made with [[blood test]]s and [[urinalysis]]. The mainstay of treatment is generous quantities of [[intravenous]] fluids, but may include [[dialysis]] or [[hemofiltration]] in more severe cases.<ref name="CritCare2005"/><ref name=Bosch/>

Rhabdomyolysis and its complications are significant problems for those injured in disasters such as earthquakes and bombings. Relief efforts in areas struck by earthquakes often include medical teams with the skills and equipment to treat survivors with rhabdomyolysis. The disease was first described in the 20th century, and important discoveries as to its mechanism were made during [[The Blitz|the Blitz of London]] in 1941.<ref name="Vanholder2000"/> [[Horse]]s may also suffer from rhabdomyolysis from a variety of causes.<ref name=Aleman/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
The symptoms of rhabdomyolysis depend on the severity of the condition, and whether kidney failure develops. Milder forms of rhabdomyolysis may not cause any muscle symptoms, and the diagnosis is based on abnormal [[blood test]]s in the context of other problems. More severe rhabdomyolysis is characterized by [[Myalgia|muscle pain]], tenderness, [[Muscle weakness|weakness]] and [[edema|swelling]] of the affected muscles.<ref name=Bosch/> If the swelling is very rapid, as may happen after someone is released from under a collapsed building, the movement of fluid from the bloodstream into damaged muscle may cause [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. Other symptoms are [[nonspecific symptom|nonspecific]] and result either from the consequences of muscle tissue breakdown or from the condition that originally led to the muscle breakdown.<ref name=CritCare2005>{{cite journal |author=Huerta-Alardín AL, Varon J, Marik PE |title=Bench-to-bedside review: rhabdomyolysis – an overview for clinicians |journal=Critical Care |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=158–69 |year=2005 |pmid=15774072 |doi=10.1186/cc2978|url=http://ccforum.com/content/9/2/158 | pmc=1175909}}</ref><ref name=Bosch>{{cite journal |author=Bosch X, Poch E, Grau JM |title=Rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=361 |issue=1 |pages=62–72 |year=2009 |pmid=19571284 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra0801327}}</ref><ref name="AmFamPract2002">{{cite journal |author=Sauret JM, Marinides G, Wang GK |title=Rhabdomyolysis |journal=American Family Physician |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=907–12 |year=2002 |pmid=11898964 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0301/p907.html}}</ref> Release of the components of muscle tissue into the bloodstream causes disturbances in [[electrolyte]]s, which can lead to [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[mental confusion|confusion]], [[coma]] or [[cardiac arrhythmia|abnormal heart rate and rhythm]]. The urine may be dark, often described as "tea-colored", due to the presence of [[myoglobin]].

Swelling of the damaged muscle occasionally leads to [[compartment syndrome]]&mdash;compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and [[blood vessel]]s, in the same [[fascial compartment]]&mdash;leading to the loss of blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures.

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Myoglobin.png| upright | thumb | Schematic diagram of [[myoglobin]], a heme-containing protein that participates in oxygen storage in normal muscle but is responsible for kidney damage in rhabdomyolysis | alt=Structural drawing of the myoglobin molecule]]
Damage to skeletal muscle may take various forms. Crush injuries and other physical causes damage [[myocyte|muscle cells]] directly or interfere with their blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell [[metabolism]]. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including [[sodium|sodium ions]]. The swelling itself may lead to destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium in the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] leads to continuous [[muscle contraction]] and depletion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the main carrier of energy in the cell.<ref name="Vanholder2000">{{cite journal |author=Vanholder R, Sever MS, Erek E, Lameire N |title=Rhabdomyolysis |journal=Journal of the American Society of Nephrolology |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=1553–61 |date=1 August 2000|pmid=10906171 |url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/11/8/1553.full}}</ref><ref name=Elsayed/> ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx.<ref name=Bosch/> The persistent contraction of the muscle cell leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.<ref name=Bosch/>

[[Neutrophil granulocyte]]s—the most abundant type of [[white blood cell]]—enter the muscle tissue, producing an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] reaction and releasing [[reactive oxygen species]],<ref name="Vanholder2000"/> particularly after crush injury.<ref name=Bosch/> Crush syndrome may also cause [[reperfusion injury]] when blood flow to decompressed muscle is suddenly restored.<ref name=Bosch/>

The swollen, inflamed muscle may directly compress structures in the same [[fascial compartment]], causing [[compartment syndrome]]. The swelling may also further compromise blood supply into the area. Finally, destroyed muscle cells release potassium ions, [[phosphate]] ions, the [[heme]]-containing protein [[myoglobin]], the [[enzyme]] [[creatine kinase]] and [[uric acid]] (a breakdown product of [[purine]]s from [[DNA]]) into the blood. Activation of the coagulation system may precipitate [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].<ref name="Vanholder2000"/> [[Hyperkalemia|High potassium levels]] may lead to potentially fatal [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|disruptions in heart rhythm]]. Phosphate binds to calcium from the circulation, leading to [[hypocalcemia|low calcium levels in the blood]].<ref name="Vanholder2000"/>

Rhabdomyolysis may cause renal failure by several mechanisms. The most important problem is the accumulation of myoglobin in the [[Nephron#Renal tubule|kidney tubules]].<ref name=Bosch/><ref name=Vanholder2000/><ref name=Elsayed/> Normally, the blood protein [[haptoglobin]] binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin.<ref name=Elsayed/> [[Myoglobinuria]], the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in [[blood plasma|plasma]] exceeds 0.5–1.5&nbsp;[[gram per litre|mg/dl]]; once plasma levels reach 100&nbsp;mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient for it to be visibly discolored.<ref name=Bosch/> About 200&nbsp;grams of muscle needs to be destroyed for visible myoglobinuria to occur.<ref name=Ropper>{{cite book | editor=Ropper AH, Brown RH | title=Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology | edition=8th | author=Ropper AH, Brown RH | chapter=45: Electrophysiologic and laboratory aids in the diagnosis of neuromuscular disease | year=2005 | pages=1092–1109 | publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | location=New York | isbn=0-07-141620-X | doi=10.1036/0071469710}}</ref> As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the [[wikt:filtrate|filtrate]], myoglobin interacts with [[Tamm-Horsfall protein|Tamm–Horsfall protein]] in the [[nephron]] to form [[Urinary cast|casts]] (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation.<ref name=Bosch/> Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to renal impairment: low blood pressure leads to [[vasoconstriction|constriction of the blood vessels]] and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to [[acute tubular necrosis]], the destruction of the cells of tubules.<ref name=Vanholder2000/><ref name=Elsayed/> [[Glomerular filtration rate]] falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with [[vitamin D]] processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.<ref name="Vanholder2000"/>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:CK1I0E.png|right|thumb|alt=Colored schematic drawing of the creatine kinase enzyme|The [[CKM (gene)|M-subunit]] of [[creatine kinase]]. In skeletal muscle, creatine kinase exists predominantly in dimers containing two M-subunits, also referred to as "CK-MM".]]
A diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in anyone who has suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, but it may also be identified at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised or increasing [[creatinine]] and [[Blood urea nitrogen|urea]] levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.<ref name=CritCare2005/><ref name="Vanholder2000"/>

===General investigations===
The most reliable test in the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis is the level of [[creatine kinase]] (CK) in the blood. This enzyme is released by damaged muscle, and levels above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) indicate rhabdomyolysis. Depending on the extent of the rhabdomyolysis, concentrations up to 100,000&nbsp;[[enzyme unit|U]]/l are not unusual.<ref name="Vanholder2000"/> CK concentrations rise steadily for 12&nbsp;hours after the original muscle injury, remain elevated for 1–3&nbsp;days and then fall gradually.<ref name=CritCare2005/> Initial and peak CK levels have a linear relationship with the risk of acute renal failure: the higher the CK, the more likely it is that kidney damage will occur.<ref name=Brancaccio2010>{{cite journal |author=Brancaccio P, Lippi G, Maffulli N |title=Biochemical markers of muscular damage |journal=[[Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine]] |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=757–67 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20518645 |doi=10.1515/CCLM.2010.179}}</ref> There is no specific concentration of CK above which renal impairment definitely occurs; concentrations below 20,000&nbsp;U/l are unlikely to be associated with a risk of renal impairment, unless there are other contributing risk factors. Mild rises without renal impairment are referred to as "hyperCKemia".<ref name=Bosch/><ref name=Ropper/> Myoglobin has a short half-life, and is therefore less useful as a diagnostic test in the later stages.<ref name=CritCare2005/> Its detection in blood or urine is associated with a higher risk of renal impairment.<ref name=Brancaccio2010/> Despite this, use of urine myoglobin measurement is not supported by evidence as it lacks [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] and the research studying its utility is of poor quality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rodríguez-Capote K, Balion CM, Hill SA, Cleve R, Yang L, El Sharif A |title=Utility of urine myoglobin for the prediction of acute renal failure in patients with suspected rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=55 |issue=12 |pages=2190–7 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19797717 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2009.128546 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/55/12/2190}}</ref>

Elevated concentrations of the enzyme [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH) may be detected.<ref name=Elsayed/><ref name=Brancaccio2010/> Other markers of muscle damage, such as [[aldolase]], [[troponin]], [[Carbonic anhydrase III, muscle specific|carbonic anhydrase type 3]] and [[Heart-type fatty acid binding protein|fatty acid-binding protein]] (FABP), are mainly used in chronic muscle diseases.<ref name=Brancaccio2010/> The [[transaminase]]s, enzymes abundant in both liver and muscle tissue, are also usually increased; this can lead to the condition being confused with acute liver injury, at least in the early stages. The incidence of actual acute liver injury is 25% in people with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis; the mechanism for this is uncertain.<ref name=CritCare2005/>

[[Hyperkalemia|High potassium levels]] tend to be a feature of severe rhabdomyolysis.<ref name=CritCare2005/> [[Electrocardiography]] (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, as suggested by the presence of [[T wave]] changes or broadening of the [[QRS complex]].<ref name=Weisberg/> Low [[calcium in biology|calcium]] levels may be present in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.<ref name=CritCare2005/>

[[Urinalysis]] by [[urine test strip]] may reveal a positive result for "blood", even though no [[red blood cell]]s can be identified on [[microscopy]] of the urine; this occurs because the reagent on the test strip reacts with myoglobin.<ref name="Vanholder2000"/> The same phenomenon may happen in conditions that lead to [[hemolysis]], the destruction of red blood cells; in hemolysis the [[blood serum]] is also visibly discolored, while in rhabdomyolysis it is normal.<ref name=Elsayed/><ref name=Ropper/> If kidney damage has occurred, microscopy of the urine also reveals [[urinary cast]]s that appear pigmented and granular.<ref name=Bosch/>

===Complications===
[[Compartment syndrome]] is a clinical diagnosis, i.e. no [[diagnostic test]] conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct measurement of the pressure in a fascial compartment,<ref name="Vanholder2000"/> and the difference between this pressure and the blood pressure,<ref name=Shadgan2008>{{cite journal |author=Shadgan B, Menon M, O'Brien PJ, Reid WD |title=Diagnostic techniques in acute compartment syndrome of the leg |journal=Journal of Orthopedic Trauma |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=581–7 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18758292 |doi=10.1097/BOT.0b013e318183136d}}</ref> may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.<ref name=Shadgan2008/><ref name=Shadgan2010>{{cite journal |author=Shadgan B |title=Current thinking about acute compartment syndrome of the lower extremity |journal=Canadian Journal of Surgery |volume=53 |issue=5 |pages=329–34 |year=2010 |month=October |pmid=20858378 |pmc=2947124 |author-separator=, |author2=Menon M |author3=Sanders D |display-authors=3 |last4=Berry |first4=G |last5=Martin Jr |first5=C |last6=Duffy |first6=P |last7=Stephen |first7=D |last8=O'Brien |first8=PJ}}</ref>

[[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]], another complication of rhabdomyolysis and other forms of critical illness, may be suspected on the basis of unexpected bleeding or abnormalities in hematological tests, such as a decreasing [[platelet]] count or prolongation of the [[prothrombin time]]. The diagnosis can be confirmed with standard blood tests for DIC, such as [[D-dimer]].<ref name=Favaloro>{{cite journal |author=Favaloro EJ |title=Laboratory testing in disseminated intravascular coagulation |journal=Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=458–67 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20614398 |doi=10.1055/s-0030-1254055}}</ref>

===Underlying disorders===
If an underlying muscle disease is suspected, for instance if there is no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, it may be necessary to perform further investigations.<ref name=Elsayed/> During an attack, low levels of [[carnitine]] in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders.<ref name=Warren/> Disorders of [[glycolysis]] can be detected by various means, including the measurement of [[lactic acid|lactate]] after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis,<ref name=Warren/> while an exaggerated response is typical of [[mitochondrial disease]]s.<ref name=Guis2005/> [[Electromyography]] (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, [[Glycogen storage disease type V|McArdle's disease]] and [[phosphofructokinase deficiency]] show a phenomenon called ''cramp-like contracture''.<ref name=Ropper/> There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.<ref name=Warren/><ref name=Elsayed/>

[[Muscle biopsy]] can be useful if an episode of rhabdomyolysis is thought to be the result of an underlying muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of [[necrosis|cell death]] or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months.<ref name=Bosch/> The [[Histopathology|histopathological]] appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterised by ''ragged red fibers''.<ref name=Warren/> Biopsy sites may be identified by [[medical imaging]], such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]], as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.<ref name=Guis2005>{{cite journal | author=Guis S, Mattei JP, Cozzone PJ, Bendahan D | title=Pathophysiology and clinical presentations of rhabdomyolysis | journal=Joint Bone Spine | year=2005 | volume=72 | issue=5 | pages=382–91 | pmid=16214072 | doi=10.1016/j.jbspin.2004.04.010}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The main goal of treatment is to treat shock and preserve kidney function. Initially this is done through the administration of generous amounts of [[intravenous fluid]]s, usually [[Saline (medicine)|isotonic saline]] (0.9% [[weight per volume]] [[sodium chloride]] solution). In victims of crush syndrome it is recommended to administer intravenous fluids even before they are extracted from collapsed structures.<ref name="Vanholder2000"/><ref name=Sever>{{cite journal | author=Sever MS, Vanholder R, Lameire M | title=Management of crush-related injuries after disasters | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | year=2006 | volume=354 | issue=10 | pages=1052–63 | pmid=16525142 | doi=10.1056/NEJMra054329}}</ref> This will ensure sufficient circulating volume to deal with the muscle cell swelling (which typically commences when blood supply is restored), and to prevent the deposition of myoglobin in the kidneys.<ref name="Vanholder2000"/> Amounts of 6 to 12&nbsp;liters over 24&nbsp;hours are recommended.<ref name="Vanholder2000"/><ref name=Greaves2003>{{cite journal | author=Greaves I | title=Consensus statement on the early management of crush injury and prevention of crush syndrome | journal=Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps | year=2003 | volume=149 | issue=4 | pages=255–9 | pmid=15015795 | url=http://www.ramcjournal.com/2003/dec03/greaves.pdf | format=PDF | author-separator=, | author2=Porter K | author3=Smith JE | display-authors=3}}</ref> The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300&nbsp;ml/h in adults),<ref name=Warren/><ref name=Greaves2003/> unless there are other reasons why this might lead to complications, such as a history of [[heart failure]].<ref name=Greaves2003/>

While many sources recommend additional intravenous agents to reduce damage to the kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting.<ref name=Elsayed/> [[Mannitol]] acts by [[osmosis]] to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies and there is a risk of worsening renal function.<ref name=Bosch/> The addition of [[bicarbonate]] to the intravenous fluids may alleviate [[acidosis]] (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more [[alkaline]] to prevent cast formation in the kidneys,<ref name=Bosch/><ref name=Warren/> but there is limited evidence that it has benefits above saline alone, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues.<ref name="CritCare2005"/><ref name="Vanholder2000"/><ref name=Elsayed/> If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above.<ref name=Greaves2003/> [[Furosemide]], a [[loop diuretic]], is often used to ensure sufficient urine production,<ref name="CritCare2005"/><ref name="Vanholder2000"/> but evidence that this prevents renal failure is lacking.<ref name=HoSheridan>{{cite journal | author=Ho KM, Sheridan DJ | title=Meta-analysis of frusemide to prevent or treat acute renal failure | journal=BMJ | year=2006 | volume=333 | pages=420–25 | doi=10.1136/bmj.38902.605347.7C | pmc=1553510 | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7565/420.long | pmid=16861256 | issue=7565}}</ref>

===Electrolytes===
In the initial stages, electrolyte levels are often abnormal and require correction. High potassium levels can be life-threatening, and respond to increased urine production and renal replacement therapy (see below).<ref name=Warren/> [[Hyperkalemia#Treatment|Temporary measures]] include the administration of calcium to protect against cardiac complications, [[insulin]] or [[salbutamol]] to redistribute potassium into cells, and infusions of bicarbonate solution.<ref name=Weisberg>{{cite journal |author=Weisberg LS |title=Management of severe hyperkalemia |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=36 |issue=12 |pages=3246–51 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18936701 |doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e31818f222b}}</ref>

Calcium levels initially tend to be low, but as the situation improves calcium is released from where it has precipitated with phosphate, and vitamin D production resumes, leading to [[hypercalcemia]] (abnormally high calcium levels). This "overshoot" occurs in 20–30% of those people who have developed kidney failure.<ref name="CritCare2005"/><ref name=Elsayed/>

===Acute renal impairment===
[[File:Haemofilter.png|thumb|A hemofiltration machine | alt=Photograph of a hemofiltration machine]]
Kidney dysfunction typically develops 1–2&nbsp;days after the initial muscle damage.<ref name="CritCare2005"/> If supportive treatment is inadequate to manage this, [[renal replacement therapy]] (RRT) may be required.<ref name=Elsayed/> RRT removes excess potassium, acid and phosphate that accumulate when the kidneys are unable to function normally and is required until kidney function is regained.<ref name="CritCare2005"/>

Three main modalities of RRT are available: [[hemodialysis]], [[hemofiltration|continuous hemofiltration]] and [[peritoneal dialysis]]. The former two require access to the bloodstream (a [[dialysis catheter]]), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done several times a week in [[chronic kidney disease]], is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of [[anticoagulant]] drugs is not necessary.<ref name="Vanholder2000"/><ref name=Sever/> Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin,<ref name=Elsayed/> but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit.<ref name="CritCare2005"/><ref name="Vanholder2000"/> Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury,<ref name="Vanholder2000"/> and it may be less effective than the other modalities.<ref name="CritCare2005"/>

===Other complications===
[[Compartment syndrome]] is treated with surgery to relieve the pressure inside the muscle compartment and reduce the risk of compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. [[Fasciotomy]] is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring [[debridement]] (removal of non-viable tissue) and [[skin grafting]] in the process.<ref name=Shadgan2010/> The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.<ref name=Sever/><ref name=Greaves2003/>

[[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]] generally resolves when the underlying causes are treated, but [[supportive treatment|supportive measures]] are often required. For instance, if the [[thrombocytopenia|platelet count drops]] significantly and there is resultant bleeding, platelets may be administered.<ref name=Levi>{{cite journal |author=Levi M |title=Disseminated intravascular coagulation |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=2191–5 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17855836 |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000281468.94108.4B}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis depends on the underlying cause and whether any complications occur. Rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney impairment in patients with traumatic injury may have a [[mortality rate]] of 20%.<ref name=CritCare2005/> Admission to the intensive care unit is associated with a mortality of 22% in the absence of acute kidney injury, and 59% if renal impairment occurs.<ref name=Bosch/> Most people who have sustained renal impairment due to rhabdomyolysis fully recover their renal function.<ref name=Bosch/>

==Epidemiology==
The exact incidence of rhabdomyolysis is difficult to establish, because different definitions have been used.<ref name=Bosch/><ref name="AmFamPract2002"/> In 1995, hospitals in the U.S. reported 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis.<ref name="AmFamPract2002"/> Up to 85% of people with major traumatic injuries will experience some degree of rhabdomyolysis.<ref name=CritCare2005/> Of those with rhabdomyolysis, 10–50% develop acute kidney injury.<ref name=CritCare2005/><ref name=Bosch/> The risk is higher in people with a history of illicit drug use, alcohol misuse or trauma when compared to muscle diseases, and it is particularly high if multiple contributing factors occur together.<ref name=Bosch/> Rhabdomyolysis accounts for 7–10% of all cases of acute kidney injury in the U.S.<ref name=Bosch/><ref name=Elsayed/>

Crush injuries are common in major disasters, but especially so in earthquakes. The aftermath of the [[1988 Spitak earthquake]] prompted the establishment, in 1995, of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force, a working group of the [[International Society of Nephrology]] (a worldwide body of kidney experts). Its volunteer doctors and nurses assisted for the first time in the [[1999 İzmit earthquake]] in [[Turkey]], where 462 people received dialysis, with positive results. Treatment units are generally established outside the immediate disaster area, as [[aftershock]]s could potentially injure or kill staff and make equipment unusable.<ref name=CritCare2005/><ref name=Sever/>

==History==
[[File:Blitzaftermath.jpg|right|thumb|Investigations of people injured in collapsed buildings during [[The Blitz|the Blitz of London]] led to numerous discoveries in the mechanisms underlying renal impairment in rhabdomyolysis. | alt=Historical photograph of a building severely damaged by air-raid bombing; firefighters are putting out a blaze in the ruins.]]
The Bible may contain an early account of rhabdomyolysis. In {{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:31–33}}, the Pentateuch says that the Jews demanded wholesome food while traveling in the desert; God sent quail in response to the complaints, and people ate large quantities of quail meat. A plague then broke out, killing numerous people. Rhabdomyolysis after consuming quail was described in more recent times and called ''[[coturnism]]'' (after ''[[Coturnix]]'', the main quail genus).<ref name=Warren/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Ouzounellis T | title=Some notes on quail poisoning | journal=JAMA |date=16 February 1970 | volume=211 | issue=7 | pages=1186–7 | pmid=4904256 | doi=10.1001/jama.1970.03170070056017}}</ref> Migrating quail consume large amounts of [[Conium|hemlock]], a known cause of rhabdomyolysis.<ref name=CritCare2005/>

In modern times, early reports from the [[1908 Messina earthquake]] and World War I on renal failure after injury were followed by studies by London physicians Eric Bywaters and Desmond Beall, working at the [[Royal Postgraduate Medical School]] and the [[National Institute for Medical Research]], on four victims of [[The Blitz]] in 1941.<ref name=Warren/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Bywaters EG, Beall D|title=Crush injuries with impairment of renal function|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1941|volume=1|issue=4185|pages=427–32|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4185.427|pmid=20783577 | pmc=2161734}} Reprinted in {{cite journal|author=Bywaters EG, Beall D|title=Crush injuries with impairment of renal function |journal=Journal of the American Society of Nephrology |date=1 February 1998|volume=9|pages=322–32| pmid=9527411| url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/9/2/322.full.pdf+html|issue=2 | format=PDF }}</ref><ref name=Bywaters1990>{{cite journal | author=Bywaters EG | title=50 years on: the crush syndrome | journal=BMJ | year=1990 | volume=301 | issue=6766 | pages=1412–5 | pmc=1679829 | pmid=2279155 | doi=10.1136/bmj.301.6766.1412}}</ref> Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine of victims by [[spectroscopy]], and it was noted that the kidneys of victims resembled those of patients who had [[hemoglobinuria]] (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of the kidney damage).

==Other animals==
In animals, rhabdomyolysis mainly affects horses.<ref name=Merck>{{cite web | title=Myopathies and myositides | work=Merck Veterinary Manual, 9th edition (online version) | url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/toc_91000.htm | year=2005 | accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> Horses can develop a number of muscle disorders, many of which may progress to rhabdomyolysis. Of these, some cause isolated attacks of rhabdomyolysis (e.g. dietary deficiency in [[vitamin E]] and [[selenium]], poisoning associated with pasture or agricultural poisons such as [[organophosphate]]s), while others predispose to exertional rhabdomyolysis (e.g. the hereditary condition [[equine polysaccharide storage myopathy]]).<ref name=Aleman>{{cite journal | author=Aleman M | title=A review of equine muscle disorders | journal=Neuromuscular Disorders | year=2008 | month=Apr | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=277–87 | pmid=18395447 | doi=10.1016/j.nmd.2008.01.001}}</ref> 5–10% of [[thoroughbred]] horses and some [[standardbred]] horses suffer from the condition [[equine exertional rhabdomyolysis]]; no specific cause has been identified, but an underlying muscle calcium regulation disorder is suspected.<ref name=Aleman/>

Rhabdomyolysis affecting horses may also occur in outbreaks; these have been reported in many European countries, and later in Canada, Australia, and the United States. It has been referred to as "atypical myopathy" or "myoglobinuria of unknown etiology". No single cause has yet been found, but various mechanisms have been proposed,<ref name=Atypical>{{cite journal | author=Votion DM, Serteyn D | title=Equine atypical myopathy: a review | journal=Veterinary Journal | year=2008 | volume=178 | issue=2 | month=Nov | pages=185–190 | doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.02.004 | pmid=18375157}}</ref> and a seasonal pattern has been observed.<ref name=Aleman/> Very high creatine kinase levels are detected, and mortality from this condition is 89%.<ref name=Aleman/>
