[[Image:Heart left atrial appendage tee view.jpg|thumb|The [[left atrial appendage]] is the [[windsock]]-like structure shown to originate from the [[left atrium]] (three o'clock).]]
'''Left atrial appendage occlusion''' is a treatment strategy to prevent [[thrombosis|blood clot formation]] in [[atrial fibrillation]] (AF). In this [[Cardiac arrhythmia|heart rhythm disorder]], blood clots form in the [[left atrial appendage]] (LAA) in 90% of cases.<ref name="pmid8572814">{{cite journal |author=Blackshear JL, Odell JA |title=Appendage obliteration to reduce stroke in cardiac surgical patients with atrial fibrillation |journal=Ann. Thorac. Surg. |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=755–9 |year=1996 |month=February |pmid=8572814 |doi=10.1016/0003-4975(95)00887-X |url=}}</ref>
During [[cardiac catheterization]], an expandable [[nitinol]] frame can be introduced into the appendage.

LAA occlusion can be used as an alternative for patients who cannot use [[oral anticoagulants]] such as [[warfarin]], although it has been studied and approval is sought as an alternative in patients who are eligible for oral anticoagulants. Some patients can not take anticoagulants because of a recent or previous bleeding, non-[[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]] or pregnancy (17% in one study<ref name="pmid8074598">{{cite journal |author=Gottlieb LK, Salem-Schatz S |title=Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation.

A sizeable portion of patients (21% in the above mentioned study<ref name="pmid8074598"/>) eligible for anticoagulants are not offered them, or are not taking them. This goes especially for the [[elderly]], although studies have indicated that they can also benefit from anticoagulants.<ref name="pmid17693178">{{cite journal |author=Mant J, Hobbs FD, Fletcher K, ''et al'' |title=Warfarin versus aspirin for stroke prevention in an elderly community population with atrial fibrillation (the Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged Study, BAFTA): a randomised controlled trial |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9586 |pages=493–503 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17693178 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61233-1 |url=}}</ref>

==Devices and alternatives==
On April 23, 2009 an [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] Advisory panel voted 7 to 5 in favor of approval of the '''WATCHMAN device''' (by Atritech Inc., [[Plymouth]], [[Minnesota]]) for use in patients with non-valvular AF in centers with [[heart surgery]] backup.<ref name="FDA_Advisory">Michael O’Riordan. [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/701873 FDA Advisory Panel Votes 7 to 5 to Recommend Approval of Watchman LAA Closure Device]. Heartwire ([[Medscape]]), April 23, 2009.</ref> The panel also advised creation of a registry and a certification program for physicians who implant the device. This decision was based on the results of the PROTECT-AF trial<ref name="pmid16644311">{{cite journal |author=Fountain RB, Holmes DR, Chandrasekaran K, ''et al'' |title=The PROTECT AF (WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic PROTECTion in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) trial |journal=Am. Heart J. |volume=151 |issue=5 |pages=956–61 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16644311 |doi=10.1016/j.ahj.2006.02.005 |url=}}</ref> (presented at the 2009 [[American College of Cardiology]] Scientific Sessions<ref>Susan Jeffrey.

March 28, 2009.</ref>), which showed less [[hemorrhagic stroke]] with the device compared to treatment with warfarin; [[stroke]] and all-cause mortality outcomes were non-inferior.

Another device termed '''PLAATO''' (percutaneous left atrial appendage transcatheter occlusion) was the first LAA occlusion device,<ref name="pmid11997272">{{cite journal |author=Sievert H, Lesh MD, Trepels T, ''et al'' |title=Percutaneous left atrial appendage transcatheter occlusion to prevent stroke in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation: early clinical experience |journal=Circulation |volume=105 |issue=16 |pages=1887–9 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=11997272 |doi= 10.1161/01.CIR.0000015698.54752.6D|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11997272}}</ref><ref name="pmid15992628">{{cite journal |author=Ostermayer SH, Reisman M, Kramer PH, ''et al'' |title=Percutaneous left atrial appendage transcatheter occlusion (PLAATO system) to prevent stroke in high-risk patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation: results from the international multi-center feasibility trials |journal=J.

although it is no longer being developed by its manufacturer (Appriva Medical, Inc. from [[Sunnyvale, CA]]).
In 210 patients receiving the PLAATO device, there was an estimated 61% reduction in the calculated stroke risk.<ref>Bayard Y, Omran H, Kramer P ''et al'' (2005). "Worldwide experience of percutaneous left atrial appendage transcatheter occlusion (PLAATO)". ''J. Neurol. Sci.''  '''238''': S70–S70 [abstract].</ref>

Both LAA occlusion systems are introduced into the [[right atrium]] and are then passed into the [[left atrium]] through a [[patent foramen ovale]] or through a puncture hole. These small iatrogenic atrial septal defects usually disappeared within six months.<ref name="pmid17261703"/><ref>Schmidt H, Hammerstingl C, von der Recke G, Hardung D, Omran H (2006).

''J. Am. Coll. Cardiol.'' '''47''': 36A.</ref> Although these are catheter-based techniques, they are generally performed under [[general anaesthesia]].

The [[Amplatzer device]], used to close atrial septal defects, has also been used to occlude the left atrial appendage.<ref> name=pmid14571497>{{cite journal |author=Meier B, Palacios I, Windecker S, ''et al'' |title=Transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion with Amplatzer devices to obviate anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation |journal=Catheter Cardiovasc Interv |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=417–22 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14571497 |doi=10.1002/ccd.10660 |url=}}</ref><ref> Amplatzer left atrial appendage occlusion: Single center 10-year experience.

Transcatheter patch obliteration of the LAA has also been reported.<ref name=pmid17261703>{{cite journal |author=Onalan O, Crystal E |title=Left atrial appendage exclusion for stroke prevention in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation |journal=Stroke |volume=38 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=624–30 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17261703 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000250166.06949.95 |url=}}</ref>

The LAA can also be surgically removed simultaneous with other cardiac procedures such as the [[maze procedure]] or during [[mitral valve]] surgery.<ref name="pmid12514671">{{cite journal |author=Crystal E, Lamy A, Connolly SJ, ''et al'' |title=Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study (LAAOS): a randomized clinical trial of left atrial appendage occlusion during routine coronary artery bypass graft surgery for long-term stroke prevention |journal=Am.

Finally, the left atrial appendage has been closed in a limited number of patients using a [[thoracoscopy|chest keyhole surgery]] approach.<ref name="pmid10856866">{{cite journal |author=Johnson WD, Ganjoo AK, Stone CD, Srivyas RC, Howard M |title=The left atrial appendage: our most lethal human attachment!

==Adverse events and limitations==
The main [[adverse event]]s related to this procedure are [[pericardial effusion]], incomplete LAA closure, dislodgement of the device, blood clot formation on the device requiring prolonged oral anticoagulation, and the general risks of catheter-based techniques (such as [[air embolism]]).<ref name="pmid17397680">{{cite journal |author=Sick PB, Schuler G, Hauptmann KE, ''et al'' |title=Initial worldwide experience with the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage system for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation |journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. |volume=49 |issue=13 |pages=1490–5 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17397680 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.035 |url=}}</ref>
The left atrium anatomy can also preclude use of the device in some patients.<ref name="pmid16996847">{{cite journal |author=Fountain R, Holmes DR, Hodgson PK, Chandrasekaran K, Van Tassel R, Sick P |title=Potential applicability and utilization of left atrial appendage occlusion devices in patients with atrial fibrillation |journal=Am. Heart J. |volume=152 |issue=4 |pages=720–3 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16996847 |doi=10.1016/j.ahj.2006.05.001 |url=}}</ref>

Following implantation, a [[transesophageal echocardiography]] has to be performed to judge completeness of closure and the presence of blood clots. Patients need to use low dose [[aspirin]] indefinitely, and prolonged [[clopidogrel]] can be prescribed as well; oral anticoagulants are needed following implantation of the WATCHMAN device to allow blood vessel lining to form around the device (endothelialization).

Theoretical concerns surround the role of the LAA in [[thirst]] regulation and water retention because it is an important source of [[atrial natriuretic factor]].<ref name="pmid7455689">{{cite journal |author=Zimmerman MB, Blaine EH, Stricker EM |title=Water intake in hypovolemic sheep: effects of crushing the left atrial appendage |journal=Science |volume=211 |issue=4481 |pages=489–91 |year=1981 |month=January |pmid=7455689 |doi= 10.1126/science.7455689|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7455689}}</ref><ref name="pmid9699572">{{cite journal |author=Yoshihara F, Nishikimi T, Kosakai Y, ''et al'' |title=Atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and body fluid balance after bilateral atrial appendectomy by the maze procedure |journal=J.
