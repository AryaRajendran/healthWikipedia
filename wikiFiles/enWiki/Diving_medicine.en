[[File:Decompression chamber.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Photograph of the cramped interior of a cylinder containing two benches and two diver trainees|A [[recompression chamber]] is used to treat some diving disorders, and for training divers to recognise the symptoms.]]

'''Diving medicine''', also called '''undersea and hyperbaric medicine''' (UHB), is the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of conditions caused by humans entering the undersea environment. It includes the effects on the body of pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how relationships of a diver's fitness to dive affect a diver's safety.

[[Hyperbaric medicine]] is a corollary field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber is used as a treatment for two of the most significant diving related illnesses, [[decompression illness]] and [[arterial gas embolism]].

Diving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accidents and diving fitness. The field includes the effect of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure on the human body and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety.

In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications.

Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and an important part of diver education.

== Range and scope of diving medicine ==
{{further|Diving disorders|List of signs and symptoms of diving disorders|List of diving hazards and precautions}}
The scope of diving medicine must necessarily include conditions that are specifically connected with the activity of diving, and not found in other contexts, but this categorization excludes almost everything, leaving only deep water blackout, isobaric counterdiffusion and high pressure nervous syndrome. A more useful grouping is conditions that are associated with exposure to variations of ambient pressure. These conditions are largely shared by aviation and space medicine. Further conditions associated with diving and other aquatic and outdoor activities are commonly included in books which are aimed at the diver, rather than the specialist medical practitioner, as they are useful background to diver first aid training.

The scope of knowledge necessary for a practitioner of diving mediciene includes the medical conditions associated with diving and their treatment, physics and physiology relating to the underwater and pressurised environment, the standard operating procedures and equipment used by divers which can influence the development and management of these conditions, and the specialised equipment used for treatment.

== Diagnostics ==
{{main|List of signs and symptoms of diving disorders}}
The [[Medical sign|signs]] and [[symptoms]] of [[diving disorders]] may present during a dive, on surfacing, or up to several hours after a dive. [[Underwater diving|Divers]] have to breathe a gas which is at the same pressure as their surroundings, which can be much greater than on the surface. The [[ambient pressure]] underwater increases by {{convert|1|atm|kPa|lk=in}} for every {{convert|10|m|ft}} of depth.<ref name="BE9" />

The principal conditions are: [[decompression illness]] (which covers [[decompression sickness]] and [[arterial gas embolism]]); [[nitrogen narcosis]]; [[high pressure nervous syndrome]]; [[oxygen toxicity]]; and [[pulmonary barotrauma]] (burst lung). Although some of these may occur in other settings, they are of particular concern during diving activities.<ref name="BE9" />

The disorders are caused by [[breathing gas]] at the high pressures encountered at depth, and divers will often breathe a gas mixture different from air to mitigate these effects. [[Nitrox]], which contains more [[oxygen]] and less [[nitrogen]] is commonly used as a breathing gas to reduce the risk of decompression sickness at [[Recreational diving|recreational depths]] (up to about {{convert|40|m|ft}}). [[Helium]] may be added to reduce the amount of nitrogen and oxygen in the gas mixture when diving deeper, to reduce the effects of narcosis and to avoid the risk of oxygen toxicity. This is complicated at depths beyond about {{convert|150|m|ft|-2}}, because a helium–oxygen mixture ([[heliox]]) then causes high pressure nervous syndrome.<ref name="BE9" /> More exotic mixtures such as [[hydreliox]], a hydrogen–helium–oxygen mixture, are used at extreme depths to counteract this.<ref name="Abraini1994" />

=== Decompression sickness ===
[[Decompression sickness]] (DCS) occurs when gas, which has been breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the [[Tissue (biology)|body tissues]], forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an [[artery]] leading to damage to the [[nervous system]], [[paralysis]] or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the [[U.S. Navy]], with [[neurological]] symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. [[Pulmonary]] DCS is very rare in divers.<ref name="Powell-p70" />

=== Pulmonary barotrauma and arterial gas embolism ===
If the breathing gas in a diver's [[lungs]] cannot freely escape during an ascent, the lungs may be expanded beyon their compliance, and the lung tissues may rupture, causing [[pulmonary barotrauma]] (PBT). The gas may then enter the [[Circulatory system|arterial circulation]] producing [[arterial gas embolism]] (AGE), with effects similar to severe [[decompression sickness]].<ref name="BE10-5-p557" /> Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms.

=== Nitrogen narcosis ===
[[Nitrogen narcosis]] is caused by the pressure of dissolved gas in the body and produces [[wikt:impairment|impairment]] to the [[nervous system]]. This results in alteration to thought processes and a decrease in the diver's ability to make judgements or calculations. It can also decrease [[motor skills]], and worsen performance in tasks requiring [[manual dexterity]]. As depth increases, so does the pressure and hence the severity of the narcosis. The effects may vary widely from individual to individual, and from day to day for the same diver. Because of the perception-altering effects of narcosis, a diver may not be aware of the symptoms, but studies have shown that impairment occurs nevertheless.<ref name="BE9-2-p301" />

=== High pressure nervous syndrome ===
[[Helium]] is the least [[narcotic]] of all gases, and divers may use [[Breathing gas|breathing mixtures]] containing a proportion of helium for dives exceeding about {{convert|40|m|ft}} deep. In the 1960s it was expected that helium narcosis would begin to become apparent at depths of {{convert|300|m|ft|-2}}. However, it was found that different symptoms, such as [[tremors]], occurred at shallower depths around {{convert|150|m|ft|-2}}. This became known as [[high pressure nervous syndrome]], and its effects are found to result from both the absolute depth and the speed of descent. Although the effects vary from person to person, they are stable and reproducible for the individual.

=== Oxygen toxicity ===
Although [[oxygen]] is essential to life, in concentrations significantly greater than normal it becomes [[toxic]], overcoming the body's natural defences ([[antioxidants]]), and causing [[Necrosis|cell death]] in any part of the body. The [[lungs]] and [[brain]] are particularly affected by high [[partial pressures]] of oxygen, such as are encountered in diving. The body can tolerate partial pressures of oxygen around {{convert|0.5|bar|kPa psi|lk=in}} indefinitely, and up to {{convert|1.4|bar|kPa psi}} for many hours, but higher partial pressures rapidly increase the chance of the most dangerous effect of [[oxygen toxicity]], a [[convulsion]] resembling an [[epileptic seizure]].<ref name="BE9-4-358" /> [[Susceptible individual|Susceptibility]] to oxygen toxicity varies dramatically from person to person, and to a smaller extent from day to day for the same diver.<ref name="BE9-4-376" /> Prior to convulsion, several symptoms may be present&nbsp;– most distinctly that of an [[Aura (symptom)|aura]].

== Treatments ==
Treatment of diving disorders depends on the specific disorder or combination of disorders, but two treatments are commonly associated with first aid and definitive treatment where diving is involved. These are first aid oxygen administration at high concentration, which is seldom contraindicated, and generally recommended as a default option in diving accidents where there is any significant probability of [[hypoxia]],{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is the definitive treatment for most incidences of [[decompression illness]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. Hyperbaric treatment using other breathing gases is also used for treatment of decompression sickness if HBO is inadequate.

=== Oxygen therapy ===
{{main|Oxygen therapy}}
The administration of oxygen as a medical intervention is common in diving medicine, both for first aid and for longer term treatment.

=== Recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy ===
{{main|Hyperbaric medicine}}
Recompression treatment in a hyperbaric chamber was initially used as a life-saving tool to treat decompression sickness in caisson workers and divers who stayed too long at depth and developed decompression sickness. Now, it is a highly specialized treatment modality that has been found to be effective in the treatment of many conditions where the administration of oxygen under pressure<ref>{{cite web|author=Ernest S Campbell, MD, FACS |url=http://www.scuba-doc.com/hbo.html |title=HBO...Indications, contraindications, links references |publisher=Scuba-doc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-16}}</ref> has been found to be beneficial. Studies have shown it to be quite effective in some [[Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society|13 indications]] approved by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uhms.org/ |title=uhms.org |publisher=uhms.org |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-03-16}}</ref>

Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is generally preferred when effective, as it is usually a more efficient and lower risk method of reducing symptoms of decompression illness, but in some cases recompression to pressures where oxygen toxicity is unacceptable may be required to eliminate the bubbles in the tissues in severe cases of decompression illness.

== Training of divers and support staff in relevant first aid ==

=== Divers ===
A basic knowledge understanding of the causes, symptoms and first aid treatment of diving related disorders is part of the basic training for most recreational and professional divers, both to help the diver avoid the disorders, and to allow appropriate action in case of an incident resulting in injury.

==== Recreational divers ====
A recreational diver has the same duty of care to other divers as any ordinary member of the public, and therefore there is no obligation to train recreational divers in first aid or other medical skills. Nevertheless, first aid is training is recommended by most, if not all, recreational diver training agencies.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Recreational diving instructors and divemasters, on the other hand, are to a greater or lesser extent responsible for the safety of divers under their guidance, and therefore are generally required to be trained and certified to some level of rescue and first aid competence, as defined in the relevant training standards of the certifying body. In many cases this includes certification in [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and Oxygen administration for diving accidents.

==== Professional divers ====
Professional divers usually operate as members of a team with a duty of care for other members of the team. Divers are expected to act as standby divers for other members of the team and the duties of a standby diver include rescue attempts if the working diver gets into difficulties. Consequently, professional divers are generally required to be trained in fescuoe procedures appropriate to the modes of diving they are certified in, and to administer first aid in emergencies. The specific training, competence and registration for these skills varies, and may be specified by state or national legislation or by industry codes of practice. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Diving supervisors have a similar duty of care, and as they are responsible for operational planning and safety, generally are also expected to mange emergency procedures, including the first aid that may be required. The level of first ait training, competence and certification will generally take this into account.

*In South Africa, registered commercial and scientific divers must hold current certification in first aid at the national Level 1, with additional training in oxygen administration for diving accidents, and registered diving supervisors must hold Level 2 first aid certification.<ref name="SADR 2009" />
*Offshore diving contractors frequently follow the [[IMCA]] recommendations.

=== Diver Medic ===
A diver medic is a member of a dive team who is trained in advanced first aid.<ref name="IMCA" />
A Diver Medic recognised by IMCA must be capable of administering First Aid and emergency treatment, and carrying out the directions of a doctor pending the arrival of more skilled medical aid, and therefore must be able to effectively communicate with a doctor who is not on site, and be familiar with diving procedures and compression chamber operation. The Diver Medic must also be able to assist the diving supervisor with decompression procedures provide advice as to when more specialised medical help should be requested, and must be fit to provide treatment in a hyperbaric chamber in an emergency, and must therefore hold a valid certificate of medical fitness to dive.<ref name="IMCA D 020" />

Training standards for Diver Medic are described in the IMCA Scheme for Recognition of Diver Medic Training.<ref name="IMCA D 020" />
