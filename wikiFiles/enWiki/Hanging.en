{{About|death by hanging||Hang (disambiguation)}}
{{Capital punishment}}

'''Hanging''' is the suspension of a person by a [[Ligature strangulation|ligature]]. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' states that hanging in this sense is "specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck", though it formerly also referred to [[crucifixion]] and death by [[impalement]] in which the body would remain "hanging".  Hanging has been a common method of [[capital punishment]] since [[medieval]] times, and is the official execution method in many countries and regions today.
 
Hanging oneself describes a method of [[suicide]] in which a person applies a ligature to the neck and brings about unconsciousness and then death, by means of partial suspension or partial weight-bearing on the ligature. This method has been most often used in prisons or other institutions, where full suspension support is difficult to devise. The earliest known use of the word in this sense was in [[Anno Domini|A.D.]] 1300.<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50102310?query_type=word&queryword=hang&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=4&search_id=ytyG-jULKok-8630&hilite=50102310 OED Entry] (requires subscription).</ref>

{{See also|Official Table of Drops}}
There are four ways of performing a judicial hanging – suspension hanging, the short drop, the standard drop, and the long drop. A mechanised form of hanging, the [[upright jerker]], was also experimented with in the 18th century, with a variant of it used today in [[Iran]].

===Suspension===
Suspension, like the short drop, causes death by using the weight of the body to tighten the trachea with the noose. Prisoners are often reported to have little or no struggle before they go limp, because their [[jugular vein]] and [[carotid arteries]] are blocked and blood flow to the brain is reduced. The person slowly dies of [[strangulation]], which typically takes between ten and twenty minutes, resulting in a considerably more protracted, grisly and painful death as compared to the standard or long drop hanging.

===Short drop===
The short drop is performed by placing the condemned prisoner on the back of a cart, horse, or other vehicle, with the noose around the neck. The object is then moved away, leaving the person dangling from the rope. A ladder was also commonly used with the condemned being forced to ascend, after which the noose was tied and the ladder pulled away or turned (hence the colloquial slang for hanging "to be turned off"), leaving the condemned hanging. Another method involves using a stool, which the condemned is required to stand on, being kicked away. 

As with suspension hanging, the condemned prisoner slowly dies of [[strangulation]], which typically takes between ten and twenty minutes, resulting in a considerably more protracted, grisly and painful death as compared to the standard or long drop hanging, which is intended to kill by using the shock of the initial drop to fracture the [[spinal column]] at the neck. Before 1850, the short drop was the standard method for hanging, and is still common in [[suicides]] and extrajudicial hangings (such as [[lynchings]] and [[summary execution]]s) which do not benefit from the specialized equipment and drop-length calculation tables used by the newer methods.

Yet another short drop variant is the Austro-Hungarian "pole" method, in which:
* The condemned is made to stand before a specialized vertical pole or pillar, approximately {{convert|10|ft}} in height
* A rope is attached around the condemned's feet and routed through a pulley at the base of the pole
* The condemned is hoisted to the top of pole by means of a sling running across the chest and under the armpits
* A narrow diameter noose is looped around the prisoner's neck, then secured to a hook mounted at the top of the pole
* The chest sling is released, and the prisoner is rapidly jerked downward by the assistant executioners via the foot rope.
* The executioner stands on a stepped platform approximately {{convert|4|ft}} high beside the condemned, and guides the head downward with his hand simultaneous to the efforts of his assistants.
Nazi war criminal [[Karl Hermann Frank]] was executed in this manner in 1946 in [[Prague]].

===Standard drop===
The standard drop, which arrived as calculated in English units, involves a drop of between {{convert|4|and|6|ft}} and came into use from 1866, when the scientific details were published by an Irish doctor, [[Samuel Haughton]]. Immediately its use spread to English-speaking countries and those where judicial systems had an English origin. It was considered a humane improvement on the short drop because it was intended to be enough to break the person's neck, causing immediate paralysis and immobilization (and probable immediate unconsciousness). This method was used to execute condemned [[Nazism|Nazis]] under [[United States]] jurisdiction after the [[Nuremberg Trials]] including [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]].<ref>Report by Kingsbury Smith, International News Service, 16th October 1946.</ref> In the execution of Ribbentrop, historian Giles MacDonogh records that: "The hangman botched the execution and the rope throttled the former foreign minister for twenty minutes before he expired."<ref>MacDonogh G., "After the Reich" [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], London (2008) p. 450.</ref> This statement though does not represent the reality as the post-mortem indicated his neck snapped. The formality of a doctor pronouncing death was done some seventeen minutes later.

===Long drop===
[[File:KetchumDecapitated.jpg|left|thumb|Sepia-tone photo from a contemporary 1901 postcard showing [[Tom Ketchum]]'s decapitated body. Caption reads "Body of Black Jack after the hanging showing head snapped off."]]
This process, also known as the measured drop, was introduced to Britain in 1872 by [[William Marwood]] as a scientific advance on the standard drop. Instead of everyone falling the same standard distance, the person's height and weight<ref>[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hanging1.html The history of judicial hanging in Britain 1735 – 1964].</ref> were used to determine how much slack would be provided in the rope so that the distance dropped would be enough to ensure that the neck was broken, but not so much that the person was decapitated. The careful placement of the eye or knot of the noose (so that the head was jerked back as the rope tightened) contributed to breaking the neck .

Prior to 1892, the drop was between four and ten feet (about one to three metres), depending on the weight of the body, and was calculated to deliver a force of 1,260 [[lbf]] (5,600 [[newton (unit)|newton]]s or 572 [[kgf]]), which fractured the neck at either the 2nd and 3rd or 4th and 5th [[cervical vertebrae]]. However, this force resulted in some [[decapitation]]s, such as the infamous case of [[Tom Ketchum|Black Jack]] in [[New Mexico]] Territory in 1901. Between 1892 and 1913, the length of the drop was shortened to avoid decapitation. After 1913, other factors were also taken into account, and the force delivered was reduced to about 1,000&nbsp;lbf (4,400 N or 450 kgf). The decapitation of [[Eva Dugan]] during a botched hanging in 1930 led the state of [[Arizona]] to switch to the [[gas chamber]] as its primary execution method, on the grounds that it was believed more humane.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5D7113BF936A15757C0A964958260 "Gruesome death in gas chamber pushes Arizona towards injections"], [[New York Times]], April 25, 1992 (retrieved 7 January 2008).</ref> One of the more recent decapitations as a result of the long drop occurred when [[Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti]] was hanged in Iraq in 2007.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6261965.stm |title=Saddam Hussein's top aides hanged |date=15&nbsp;January 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=6&nbsp;December 2011}}</ref> Accidental decapitation also occurred during the 1962 hanging of [[Arthur Lucas]], one of the last two people to be put to death in Canada.<ref>{{citation  |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/1299928--the-end-of-the-rope-the-story-of-canada-s-last-executions |title=The end of the rope: The story of Canada’s last executions |date=10 December 2012 |publisher=Toronto Star |accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

==As suicide==
{{main|Suicide by hanging}}
{{See also|List of people who died by hanging}}
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -47- - Desperation.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Suicide]] by hanging]]
Hanging is a common method for committing [[suicide]]. The materials necessary for suicide by hanging are easily available to the average person, compared with firearms or lethal poison. It is a very simple yet highly effective suicide method. Full suspension is not required, and for this reason hanging is especially commonplace among suicidal [[prison]]ers (see [[suicide watch]]). A type of hanging comparable to full suspension hanging may be obtained by self-strangulation using a [[Ligature strangulation|ligature]] around the neck and the partial weight of the body (partial suspension) to tighten the ligature. When a suicidal hanging involves partial suspension, the victim is found to have both feet touching the ground e.g. they are kneeling, crouching or standing.

In [[Canada]], hanging is the most common method of suicide,<ref name="cansuicide">{{cite news |first= |last= |pages= |title=Canadian Injury Data |date= |publisher=Statistics Canada |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/injury-bles/cid98-dbc98/index.html}}{{Dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> and in the U.S., hanging is the second most common method, after firearms.<ref>[http://www.preventsuicidenow.com/suicide-statistics.html Suicide Statistics]. URL accessed on 2006-05-16.</ref> In the United Kingdom, where firearms are less easily available, as of 2001 hanging was the most common method among men and the second most commonplace among women (after poisoning).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_health/HSQ20.pdf |title=Trends in suicide by method in England and Wales, 1979 to 2001 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

==Medical effects==
{{original research|section|date=October 2010}}
{{Essay-like|section|date=October 2010}}
A hanging may induce one or more of the following medical conditions, some leading to death:

*Closure of [[carotid arteries]] causing [[cerebral ischemia]]
*Closure of the [[jugular vein]]s
*Induction of [[carotid sinus reflex death]], which reduces heartbeat when the pressure in the [[carotid arteries]] is high, causing [[cardiac arrest]]
*Breaking of the [[neck]] ([[cervical fracture]]) causing traumatic [[Cervical spine injury|spinal cord injury]] or even [[decapitation]]
*Closure of the [[airway]]
*[[Death erection]]

The cause of death in hanging depends on the conditions related to the event. When the body is released from a relatively high position, the major cause of death is severe trauma to the upper cervical spine.  However, the injuries produced are highly variable.  One study showed that only a small minority of a series of judicial hangings produced fractures to the cervical spine (6 out of 34 cases studied), with half of these fractures (3 out of 34) being the classic "[[hangman's fracture]]" (bilateral fractures of the pars interarticularis of the C2 vertebra).<ref>James R, Nasmyth-Jones R., ''The occurrence of cervical fractures in victims of judicial hanging'', Forensic Science International, 1992 Apr;54(1):81–91.</ref>  The location of the knot of the hanging rope is a major factor in determining the mechanics of cervical spine injury, with a submental knot (hangman's knot under the chin) being the only location capable of producing the sudden, straightforward hyperextension injury that causes the classic "hangman's fracture".

There is evidence suggesting that there might be superior alternatives if there were sufficient interest to support research into such matters. Consider in particular an event recounted in the biography of Albert Pierrepoint.<ref name="isbn0-340-21307-8"/> Events followed a most unconventional sequence during the hanging of a particularly powerful and uncooperative German spy during World War II. Pierrepoint relates:
"Just as I was crossing to the lever, he jumped with bound feet. The drop opened, and he plunged down, and I saw with horror that the noose was slipping. It would have come right over his head had it not caught roughly at a point halfway up the hood – it had in fact been stopped on his upper lip by the projection of his nose – and the body jerked down, then became absolutely still apart from the swinging of the rope. I went down into the pit with the prison medical officer. He examined the body and said to me: "A clean death. Instantaneous." He sounded surprised, and I did not blame him. I was surprised myself, and very relieved. On my next visit to Wandsworth the governor told me that the severance of the spinal cord had been perfect."

Not surprisingly in retrospect, it appears that such unconventional application of forces might be particularly efficient. There is at least some evidence that some of the countries with particularly active programs of judicial execution may have given the question of the design of efficient and reliable nooses practical attention. For example, photographs of nooses in a South African execution chamber opened to the public after abolishment of the death penalty, showed double nooses.<ref>[http://www.executedtoday.com/images/South_Africa_Pretoria_prison_gallows.jpg Executedtoday.com], South Africa Pretoria prison gallows.</ref> Presumably the upper noose held the lower one in place to ensure a perfect hangman's fracture. The possibly more elegant, but probably more tricky English technique with a single running noose and a rope so arranged as to whip around into the ideal position, might well have been too error-prone to be satisfactorily reliable in any but highly skilled hands. If so, the likes of the double noose might have much merit.

The side, or subaural knot, has been shown to produce other, more complex injuries, with one thoroughly studied case producing only ligamentous injuries to the cervical spine and bilateral vertebral artery disruptions, but no major vertebral fractures or crush injuries to the spinal cord.<ref>Wallace SK, Cohen WA, Stern EJ, Reay DT, ''Judicial hanging: postmortem radiographic, CT, and MR imaging features with autopsy confirmation'', Radiology, 1994 Oct;193(1):263–7.</ref>  Death from a "hangman's fracture" occurs mainly when the applied force is severe enough to also cause a severe subluxation of the C2 and C3 vertebra that crushes the spinal cord and/or disrupts the vertebral arteries.  Hangman's fractures from other hyperextension injuries (the most common being unrestrained motor vehicle accidents and falls or diving injuries where the face or chin suddenly strike an immovable object) are frequently survivable if the applied force does not cause a severe subluxation of C2 on C3.
[[File:Hanged, drawn and quartered.jpg|thumb|200px|[[John Ogilvie (saint)|John Ogilvie]], who in 1615 was hanged and disemboweled after torture for his refusal to give up the Catholic faith and revert to Protestantism.]]
Another process that has been suggested is [[carotid sinus reflex death]]. By this theory, the mechanical stimulation of the [[carotid sinus]] in the neck brings on terminal cardiac arrest.

In the absence of fracture and dislocation, occlusion of blood vessels becomes the major cause of death, rather than [[asphyxia]]tion. Obstruction of venous drainage of the brain via occlusion of the internal jugular veins leads to [[cerebral edema]] and then [[cerebral ischemia]]. The face will typically become engorged and [[cyanosis|cyanotic]] (turned blue through lack of oxygen). There will be the classic sign of strangulation, [[petechiae]], little blood marks on the face and in the eyes from burst blood capillaries. The tongue may protrude.

Compromise of the cerebral blood flow may occur by obstruction of the carotid arteries, even though their obstruction requires far more force than the obstruction of jugular veins, since they are seated deeper and they contain blood in much higher pressure compared to the jugular veins. Only 31 newtons (7&nbsp;lbf or 3.2 kgf) of force may be enough to constrict the carotid arteries to the point of rapid unconsciousness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Where death has occurred through carotid artery obstruction or cervical fracture, the face will typically be pale in color and not show petechiae. Many reports and pictures exist of actual short-drop hangings that seem to show that the person died quickly, while others indicate a slow and agonizing death by strangulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richard.clark32.btinternet.co.uk/hanging2.html#causes|title=How hanging causes death|accessdate = 2006-04-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060426025804/http://www.richard.clark32.btinternet.co.uk/hanging2.html#causes <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-04-26}}</ref>

When cerebral circulation is severely compromised by any mechanism, arterial or venous, death occurs over four or more minutes from cerebral hypoxia, although the heart may continue to beat for some period after the brain can no longer be resuscitated. The time of death in such cases is a matter of convention. In judicial hangings, death is pronounced at cardiac arrest, which may occur at times from several minutes up to 15 minutes or longer after hanging. During suspension, once the prisoner has lapsed into unconsciousness, rippling movements of the body and limbs may occur for some time which are usually attributed to nervous and muscular reflexes. In Britain, it was normal to leave the body suspended for an hour to ensure death.

After death, the body typically shows marks of suspension: bruising and rope marks on the neck. Moreover, sphincters will relax spontaneously and urine and faeces will be evacuated. Forensic experts may often be able to tell if hanging is suicide or homicide, as each leaves a distinctive ligature mark. One of the hints they use is the [[hyoid bone]]. If broken, it often means the person has been [[murder]]ed by manual [[choking]].

Hanging has been a method of [[capital punishment]] in many countries. <!--This section should only contain notable political hanging deaths and political policies on hanging, and not a specific overview for each country.-->

===Australia===
{{Main|Capital punishment in Australia}}
Capital punishment was a part of the legal system of [[Australia]] from its early days as a penal colony for the British Empire, until 1967. During the 19th century, crimes that could carry a death sentence included [[burglary]], sheep stealing, [[forgery]], [[sexual assault]]s, murder and [[manslaughter]]. During the 19th century, there were about 80 people hanged each year throughout Australia for these crimes.

Australia abolished the death penalty in all states by 1985.<ref name="relTolerance">[http://www.religioustolerance.org/executh.htm Countries that have abandoned the use of the death penalty], Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, November 8, 2005</ref>

===Brazil===
Death by hanging was the customary method of capital punishment in [[Brazil]] throughout its history. Some important national heroes like [[Tiradentes]] (1792) were killed by hanging. The last man executed in Brazil was the slave Francisco, in 1876.
The death penalty was abolished for all crimes, except for those committed under extraordinary circumstances such as war or military law, in 1890.<ref name="encarta">[http://encarta.msn.com/media_461543496/Capital_Punishment_Worldwide.html Capital Punishment Worldwide], MSN Encarta.

===Bulgaria===
[[Bulgaria]]'s national hero, [[Vasil Levski]], was executed by hanging by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] court in [[Sofia]] in 1873. Every year since Bulgaria's [[liberty|liberation]], thousands come with flowers on the date of his death, February 19, to his monument where the gallows stood.

The last execution was in 1989, and the death penalty was abolished for all crimes in 1998.<ref name="encarta" />

===Canada===
{{Main|Capital punishment in Canada}}
Historically, hanging was the only method of execution used in [[Canada]] and was in use as punishment for all murders until 1961, when murders were reclassified into capital and non-capital offences. The death penalty was restricted to only apply for certain offences to the National Defence Act in 1976 and was completely abolished in 1998.<ref>Susan Munroe, [http://canadaonline.about.com/cs/crime/a/cappuntimeline.htm History of Capital Punishment in Canada], About: Canada Online,</ref>

In the territories occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] from 1939 to 1945, strangulation hanging was a preferred means of public execution, although more criminal executions were performed by [[guillotine]] than hanging. The most commonly sentenced were [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s and [[black market]]eers, whose bodies were usually left hanging for long periods of time. There are also numerous reports of concentration camp inmates being hanged. Hanging was continued in post-war Germany in the British and US Occupation Zones under their jurisdiction, and for Nazi war criminals, until well after (western) Germany itself had abolished the death penalty by the [[Constitution of Germany|German constitution]] as adopted in 1949. West Berlin was not subject to the "Grundgesetz" ([[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]) and abolished the death penalty in 1951. The [[German Democratic Republic]] did not abolish the death penalty until 1987. The last execution ordered by a West German court was carried out by guillotine in Moabit prison in 1949. The last hanging in Germany was the one ordered of several war criminals in [[Landsberg am Lech]] on June 7, 1951. The last known execution in East Germany was in 1981 by a pistol shot to the neck.<ref name="relTolerance" />

{{Main|Capital punishment in Iran}}

Death by hanging is the primary means of capital punishment in Iran.  It is legal for murder, rape, and drug trafficking unless the criminal pays [[diyya]] to the victim's family, thus attaining their forgiveness (see [[Sharia law]]). If the presiding judge deems the case to be "causing public outrage," he can order the hanging to take place in public at the spot where the crime was committed, typically from a mobile telescoping crane which hoists the condemned high into the air.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wallace |first=Mark |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/06/opinion/la-oe-wallace-cranes-iran-20110706 |title=Iran's execution binge |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2011-07-06 |accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> On July 19, 2005, two boys, [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni]], aged 15 and 17 respectively, who had been convicted of the rape of a 13-year-old boy, were hanged at Edalat (Justice) Square in [[Mashhad]], on charges of [[homosexuality]] and [[rape]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://direland.typepad.com/direland/2005/07/iran_executes_2.html|title=Iran executes 2 gay teenagers|accessdate = 2006-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gayrussia.ru/en/detail.php?ID=1596|title=Exclusive interview with gay activists in Iran on situation of gays, recent executions of gay teens and the future|accessdate = 2006-04-27}}</ref> On August 15, 2004, a 16-year-old girl, [[Atefeh Sahaaleh]] (a.k.a.

===Pakistan===

In Pakistan hanging is the most common form of execution.

===Russia===
{{Main|Capital punishment in Russia}}
Hanging was commonly practiced in the [[Russian Empire]] during the rule of the [[Romanov Dynasty]] as an alternative to [[impalement]], which was used in the 15th and 16th centuries.

Hanging was eliminated in 1868 by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] after [[serfdom]], but was restored by the time of his death and his assassins were hanged. While those sentenced to death for murder were usually pardoned and sentences commuted to life imprisonment, those guilty of high treason were usually executed. This included also the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] under the Russian crown. [[Taavetti Lukkarinen]] became the last Finn to be executed this way. He was hanged for espionage and high treason in 1916.

The hanging was usually performed by short drop and in public. The gallows was usually either a stout nearby tree branch, as in case of Lukkarinen, or a makeshift gallows constructed for the purpose.

After the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, capital punishment was, on paper, abolished, but continued to be used unabated against people perceived to be enemies of the regime. Under the Bolsheviks, most executions were performed by shooting, either by firing squad or by a single firearm. The last to be hanged were [[Andrei Vlasov]] and his companions in 1946.

According to a 19th century report, members of the [[Alawite]] sect centered around [[Lattakia]] in [[Syria]] had a particular aversion towards being hanged, and the family of the condemned was willing to pay "considerable sums" to ensure their relation was [[Impalement|impaled]], instead of being hanged. As far as [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt|Burckhardt]] could make out, this attitude was based upon the Alawites' idea that the soul ought to leave the body through the mouth, rather than leave it in any other fashion.<ref>Burckhardt, J.L.:"[http://books.google.no/books?id=5LkWAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:travels+intitle:in+intitle:syria+inauthor:burckhardt&hl=no&sa=X&ei=3JkKUdHUC-OE4ATUooDYBg&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=empaled&f=false Travels in Syria and the Holy Land]", London 1822, p.156</ref>

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Capital punishment in the United Kingdom}}

As a form of [[judiciary|judicial]] execution in [[England]], hanging is thought to date from the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]].<ref>"[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Hanging Hanging]". The 11th Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.</ref> Records of the names of British [[Executioner|hangmen]] begin with Thomas de Warblynton in the 1360s;{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} complete records extend from the 16th century to the last hangmen, [[Robert Leslie Stewart]] and [[Harry Allen (executioner)|Harry Allen]], who conducted the last British executions in 1964.

At the beginning of the 19th century, children in Britain were punished in the same way as adults. They were even sentenced to death for petty theft.<ref>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894775,00.html National Affairs: CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: A FADING PRACTICE]". ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. March 21, 1960.</ref> In 1814 five child criminals under the age of fourteen were hanged at the Old Bailey, the youngest being only eight years old.<ref>"[http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Learning/Learningonline/features/wc/world_city_6.htm London's children in the 19th century]". Museum of London.</ref>
Until 1868 hangings were performed in public. In London, the traditional site was at [[Tyburn]], a settlement west of the [[City of London|City]] on the main road to [[Oxford]], which was used on eight hanging days a year, though before 1865, executions had been transferred to the street outside [[Newgate Prison]], [[Old Bailey]], now the site of the [[Old Bailey|Central Criminal Court]].

In 1957, in an attempt to prevent the abolition of capital punishment completely, two levels of murder were defined: First Degree murder and Second Degree with only First Degree murder carrying the death penalty.

In 1965, Parliament passed the [[Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act]], temporarily abolishing capital punishment for murder for 5 years. The Act was renewed in 1969, making the abolition permanent. And with the passage of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] and the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the death penalty was officially abolished for all crimes in both civilian and military cases. Following its complete abolition, the gallows were removed from [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)|Wandsworth Prison]], where they remained in full working order until that year.

The last woman to be hanged was [[Ruth Ellis]] on July 13, 1955, by [[Albert Pierrepoint]] who was a prominent hangman in the 20th century in England. The last hanging in Britain took place in 1964, when [[Peter Anthony Allen]], at [[Liverpool (HM Prison)|Walton Prison]] in [[Liverpool]], and [[Gwynne Owen Evans]], at [[Strangeways Prison]] in [[Manchester]] were executed for the murder of [[John Alan West]].

====Silken rope====
In the UK, some felons were traditionally executed by hanging with a silken rope:

* [[poachers]] who killed the "King's royal deer",{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} as in the [[Child ballad]] ''[[Geordie (ballad)|Geordie]]''.
* [[hereditary peers]] who committed [[capital offence]]s,<ref>[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980212/text/80212-26.htm Lords Hansard text for 12 February 1998], Hansard, Col. 1350.</ref> as anticipated by the fictional [[Duke of Denver]], brother of [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]. The Duke was accused of murder in the novel ''[[Clouds of Witness]]'', and if convicted, this execution would have been his fate, after conviction by his peers in a trial in the [[House of Lords]]. However, it has been claimed that the execution of [[Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers|Earl Ferrers]] in 1760 – the only time a peer was hanged after trial by the [[House of Lords]] – was carried out with the normal hempen rope instead of a silk one. The writ of execution does not specify a silk rope be used,<ref>[http://www.languageandlaw.org/TEXTS/WRITS/EXECUTE.HTM Writ of Execution – Laurence, Earl Ferrers].</ref> and the [[Newgate Calendar]] makes no mention of the use of such an item<ref>[http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ng284.htm The Newgate Calendar – Laurence, Earl Ferrers].</ref> – an unusual omission given its highly sensationalist nature.

Various methods of capital punishment have been replaced by [[lethal injection]] in most states and the federal government. Many states that offered hanging as an option have since eliminated the method. Condemned murderer [[Victor Feguer]] became the last inmate to be executed by hanging in the state of [[Iowa]] on March 15, 1963. Hanging was the preferred method of execution for capital murder cases in Iowa until 1965, when the death penalty was abolished and replaced with [[life imprisonment]] without [[parole]]. [[Barton Kay Kirkham]] was the last person to be hanged in Utah, preferring it over [[execution by firing squad]]. No subsequent inmate in Utah had been hanged by the time the option was replaced with lethal injection in 1980{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. Laws in [[Delaware]] were changed in 1986 to specify lethal injection, except for those convicted before 1986 (who were still allowed to choose hanging). If a choice was not made, or the convict refused to choose injection, then hanging would become the default method. This was the case in the 1996 execution of [[Billy Bailey]], the most recent hanging in American history. Since the hanging of Bailey, no Delaware prisoner fit into this category, thus the practice ended there ''[[de facto]]'', and the state's gallows were dismantled.

Only the states of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[New Hampshire]] presently retain hanging as an option. In New Hampshire, if it is found to be "impractical" to carry out the execution by lethal injection, then the condemned will be hanged, and in Washington the condemned still has an outright choice between hanging and lethal injection.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/lxii/630/630-5.htm | title=Section 630.5, Procedures in Capital Murder | accessdate = 2006-04-27 }}</ref>

==Inverted hanging, the "Jewish" punishment==
[[File:Picture of inverted hanging.png|thumb|Woodcut by [[Johann Stumpf (writer)|Johann Stumpf]], who witnessed this type of execution in 1553]]
A completely different principle of hanging is to hang the convicted person from his legs, rather than from his neck, either as a form of torture, or as an execution method. In medieval Germany, this came to be primarily associated with Jews, called the "[[:de:Judenstrafe|Judenstrafe]]". The jurist [http://www.kettererkunst.com/bio/ulrich-tengler-1447.shtml Ulrich Tengler], in his highly influential "Layenspiegel" from 1509, describes the procedure as follows, in the section "Von Juden straff":<ref>Tengler, U: "[http://books.google.no/books?id=4DZLAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:layenspiegel&hl=no&sa=X&ei=Y8wDUeb_CtKO4gSb0YGoDw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=juden&f=false Layenspiegel]" p.119</ref>
{{quote|Den Juden zwischen zweyen wütenden oder beissenden hunde zu der gewonlichen gerichtstatt zu ziehen. vel schlieffen, mit dem strang oder ketten bey seinen füssen an eynen besondern galgen zwischen die hund nach verkerter mass hencken damit er also von leben zom tod gericht wird}}  
{{quote|About dragging the Jew to the ordinary execution place between two mad or biting dogs. After dragging, to hang him from his feet by rope or chain at a designated gallows between the dogs, and in such inverted manner to be executed, from life to death}}
[[:de:Guido Kisch|Guido Kisch]], however, showed that originally, this type of inverted hanging between two dogs was not a punishment specifically for Jews. [http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~msecohen/ Esther Cohen] writes:<ref>Cohen, Esther (1993): "[http://books.google.no/books?id=5lclnUXYB4sC&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92 The Crossroads of Justice: Law and Culture in Late Medieval France]" Brill ,p.92-93</ref>
{{quote|The inverted hanging with the accompaniment of two dogs, originally reserved for traitors, was identified from the fourteenth century as the "Jewish execution" , being practiced in the later middle ages throughout both northern and Mediterrenean Europe. The Jewish execution in Germany has been thoroughly studied by G. Kisch, who has argued convincingly that neither the inverted hanging nor the stringing up of dogs or wolves beside the victim were particularly Jewish punishments during the High Middle Ages. They first appeared as Jewish punishments in Germany only towards the end of the thirteenth century, never being recognized as exclusively Jewish penalties. 
In France the inverted, animal-associated hanging came to be connected with Jews by the later Middle Ages. The inverted hanging of Jews is specifically mentioned in the old customs of Burgundy in the context of animal hanging.

The details of the cases vary widely: In the 1444 Frankfurt cases and the 1499 Hanau case, the dogs were dead prior to be hanged, and in the late 1615 and 1661 cases in Frankfurt, the Jews (and dogs) were merely kept in this torture for half an hour, before being garrotted from below.  In the 1588 Bergen case, however, all three victims were left hanging till they were dead, ranging from 6 to 8 days after being hung up. In the Dortmund 1486 case, the dogs bit the Jew to death while hanging. In the 1553 Württemberg case, the Jew chose to convert to Christianity after hanging like this for 24 hours; he was then given the mercy to be hanged in the ordinary manner, from the neck, and without the dogs beside him. 

In the 1462 Halle case, the Jew Abraham also converted after 24 hours hanging upside down, and a priest went up on a ladder and baptized him. For two more days, Abraham was left hanging, while the priest argued with the city council that a true Christian should not be punished in this way. On the third day, Abraham was granted a reprieve, and was taken down, but died 20 days later in the local hospital having meanwhile suffered in extreme pain. In the 1637 case, where the Jew had murdered a Christian jeweller, the appeal to the [[Maria Anna of Spain|empress]] was successful, and out of mercy, the Jew was condemned to be merely pinched with glowing pincers, have hot lead dripped into his wounds, and then be [[Breaking wheel|broken alive on the wheel]].

As an example of a non-Jew who suffered this punishment as a torture, in 1196 [[Richard, Count of Acerra]], was one of those executed by [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] in the suppression of the rebelling Sicilians:<ref>[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/ricsgermano.doc ''Ryccardi di Sancto Germano Notarii Chronicon''] trans. G. A. Loud</ref>{{quote|He [Henry VI] held a general court in Capua, at which he ordered that the count first be drawn behind a horse through the squares of Capua, and then hanged alive head downwards. The latter was still alive after two days when a certain German jester called Leather-Bag [Follis], hoping to please the emperor, tied a large stone to his neck and shamefully put him to death}}

==Hanged by the ribs==
[[File:BLAKE12.JPG|thumb|right|"A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows," by [[William Blake]].  Originally published in Stedman's ''Narrative''.]]
In 1713, [[Juraj Jánošík]], a legendary Slovak outlaw and [[folk hero]], was sentenced to be hung from his left rib. He was left to slowly die.<ref>"[http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/46928/8/modern_day_outlaws_gather_to_honour_janosik.html Modern-day ‘outlaws’ gather to honour Jánošík]". The Slovak Spectator. July 9, 2012.</ref> 

The Dutch overlords in [[Suriname]] also were in habit to hang a slave from the ribs. [[John Gabriel Stedman]] stayed in South America from 1772–77 and described the method as told by a witness:<ref>Stedman, J.G.: "[http://books.google.no/books?id=mywAAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:G_wuhslhRwkC&hl=no&sa=X&ei=Rx8BUYDrIYKJ4gTbmoGQCQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=quartered&f=false Narrative, of a five years' expedition]", Vol.1, London 1813, p.116</ref>
{{quote|Not long ago, (continued he) I saw a black "man suspended alive from a gallows by the ribs, between which, with a knife, was first made an incision, and then clinched an iron hook with a chain: in this manner he kept alive three days, hanging with his head "and feet downwards, and catching with his tongue the "drops of water (it being in the rainy season) that were "flowing down his bloated breast. Notwithstanding all this, he never complained, and even upbraided a negro "for crying while he was flogged below the gallows, by calling out to him: "You man ?—Da boy fasy? Are you a man? you behave like a boy". Shortly after which he was knocked on the head by the commiserating sentry, who stood over him, with the butt end of his musket.}}

==Grammar==
The proper, traditional past tense and past participle form of the verb "hang", in this sense, is (to be) "hanged" and not "hung". Some dictionaries list only "hanged,"<ref>Online {{cite web
