'''Hypovitaminosis D''' is a '''deficiency of [[vitamin D]]'''. It can result from inadequate nutritional intake of vitamin D coupled with inadequate sunlight exposure (in particular sunlight with adequate [[ultraviolet]] B rays), disorders that limit vitamin D absorption, and conditions that impair the conversion of vitamin D into active [[metabolite]]s including certain [[liver]], kidney, and hereditary disorders.<ref name="Merck">{{MerckManual|01|004|k|BABBBEAE|Vitamin D}}</ref> Deficiency results in impaired bone mineralization and leads to bone softening diseases including [[rickets]] in children and [[osteomalacia]] and [[osteoporosis]] in adults.<ref name="Merck" />

Prior to the fortification of milk products with vitamin D, rickets was a major public health problem. In the United States, milk has been fortified with 10&nbsp;micrograms (400&nbsp;[[International unit|IU]]) of vitamin D per [[quart]] since the 1930s, leading to a dramatic decline in the number of rickets cases.<ref name="Sun">{{cite journal |author=Holick MF |title=Sunlight and vitamin D for bone health and prevention of autoimmune diseases, cancers, and cardiovascular disease |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=80 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=1678S–88S |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15585788 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15585788}}</ref>

==Risk factors==

===Age===
The amount of vitamin D recommended for all infants, children, and adolescents has recently increased – from 400 to 600 IU per day. The Institute of Medicine released the Consensus Report on Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D on November 30, 2010.   IOM recommends 600 IU of vitamin D a day for those 1-70 and 800 IU for those over 70 years of age.<ref>http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2010/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-for-Calcium-and-Vitamin-D.aspx</ref>  As of October 2008, the American Pediatric Association advises vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU/day (10μg/d) from birth onwards.<ref name="FactD">{{cite web|url=http://dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamind.asp|title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Vitamin D |publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=2007-09-10|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5Rl5u0LB5 |archivedate=2007-09-10}}</ref><ref name="APA2008">{{cite news |first=Kathleen |last=Kingsbury |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Kids Aren't Getting Enough Vitamin D |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1849900,00.html |work=Time Health & Science |publisher=Time Inc. |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=15 November 2008}}</ref> (1 IU Vitamin D is the biological equivalent of 0.025 μg cholecalciferol/ergocalciferol.)

===Malnutrition===
Although rickets and osteomalacia are now rare in Britain, there have been outbreaks in some immigrant communities in which osteomalacia sufferers included women with seemingly adequate daylight outdoor exposure wearing Western clothing.<ref>{{cite pmid|9483661}},</ref> Having darker skin and reduced exposure to sunshine did not produce rickets unless the diet deviated from a Western omnivore pattern characterized by high intakes of meat, fish and eggs, and low intakes of high-extraction [[cereals]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6970590 |year=1981 |last1=Robertson |first1=I |last2=Ford |first2=JA |last3=McIntosh |first3=WB |last4=Dunnigan |first4=MG |title=The role of cereals in the aetiology of nutritional rickets: the lesson of the Irish National Nutrition Survey 1943-8 |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=17–22 |journal=The British journal of nutrition |doi=10.1079/BJN19810073}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-277X.1989.tb00015.x}}</ref><ref name="cite pmid|15585795">{{cite pmid|15585795}},</ref> The dietary risk factors for rickets include abstaining from animal foods .<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9483661 |year=1997 |last1=Dunnigan |first1=MG |last2=Henderson |first2=JB |title=An epidemiological model of privational rickets and osteomalacia |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=939–56 |journal=The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society |doi=10.1079/PNS19970100}}</ref><ref name="cite doi|10.1079/BJN20051558">{{cite doi|10.1079/BJN20051558}}</ref> Vitamin D deficiency remains the main cause of rickets among young infants in most countries, because breast milk is low in vitamin D and social customs and climatic conditions can prevent adequate UVB  exposure.

===Obesity===
[[Obese]] individuals have lower levels of the circulating form of vitamin D, probably because of reduced [[bioavailable|bioavailability]], and are at higher risk of deficiency. To maintain blood levels of calcium, therapeutic vitamin D doses are sometimes administered (up to 100,000&nbsp;IU or 2.5&nbsp;mg daily) to patients who have had their parathyroid glands removed (most commonly [[renal dialysis]] patients who have had [[tertiary hyperparathyroidism]], but also to patients with [[primary hyperparathyroidism]]) or with [[hypoparathyroidism]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holick MF |title=The vitamin D epidemic and its health consequences |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=135 |issue=11 |pages=2739S–48S |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16251641 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16251641}}</ref> Patients with chronic [[liver disease]] or [[intestinal malabsorption]] disorders may also require larger doses of vitamin D (up to 40,000&nbsp;IU or 1&nbsp;mg (1000&nbsp;micrograms) daily).

It has been argued that there is little evidence to support the use of high dose therapy to attain thresholds for vitamin D deficiency that greatly exceed widely used definitions of vitamin D deficiency (25OHD <10&nbsp;ng/ml or 25 nmol/L),  and for  vitamin D insufficiency (25OHD < 20&nbsp;ng/ml or 50 nmol/L). Studies are potentially subject to confounding by frailty as people with poorer health are likely to remain indoors, receive less sun exposure, and have low 25OHD levels compared to their healthy peers (rather than low vitamin D levels causing ill health). Those leading sedentary lives are at increased risk of obesity, and increased fat mass is inversely associated with 25OHD levels.<ref>{{cite pmid|16027959}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|16932872}}</ref>   This association may confound the reported relationships between low vitamin D status and conditions such as diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, and cancer that occur more commonly in obesity.<ref>{{cite pmid|11434789}}</ref> Confounding by health status can be powerful, as evidenced by the disparate results of randomised controlled trials and observational studies of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy. (see [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)]]).<ref>{{cite pmid|17972977}},</ref> Obesity remains a likely confounding factor for the associations between low 25(OH)D levels and poor health.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/jid.2009.353}}</ref> Some continue to argue the reverse – that obese and sedentary people are at high risk of many diseases specifically because they have low serum 25(OH)D levels <ref>{{cite pmid|17368188}},</ref>

===Sun exposure===
The use of [[sunscreen]] with a [[sun protection factor]] (SPF) of 8 can theoretically inhibit more than 95% of vitamin D production in the skin.<ref name="Sun" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sayre RM, Dowdy JC |title=Darkness at noon: sunscreens and vitamin D3 |journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=459–63 |year=2007 |pmid=17115796 |doi=10.1562/2006-06-29-RC-956}}</ref> In practice, however, sunscreen is applied so as to have a negligible effect on vitamin D status.<ref>{{cite pmid|7726582}},</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|9767286}},</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19663879}},</ref> The vitamin D status of those in Australia and [[New Zealand]]<ref name=Nowson>{{cite journal |author=Nowson CA, Margerison C |title=Vitamin D intake and vitamin D status of Australians |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=177 |issue=3 |pages=149–52 |year=2002 |month=August |pmid=12149085 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/177_03_050802/now10763_fm.html}}</ref> is unlikely to have been affected by campaigns advocating sunscreen. Instead, wearing clothing is more effective at reducing the amount of skin exposed to UVB and reducing natural vitamin D synthesis.

Another risk factor arising from lack of sun exposure is clothing which covers a large portion of the skin. This clothing when worn on a consistent and regular basis, such as the [[burqa]], is correlated with lower vitamin D levels and an increased prevalence of hypovitaminosis D.<ref name='Mishal 2001'>{{cite journal | title = Effects of Different Dress Styles on Vitamin D Levels in Healthy Young Jordanian Women | journal= Osteoporosis International | first=AA | last = Mishal | volume = 12 | issue = 11 | year = 2001 | publisher= Springer London | pages = 931–935 | quote = The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was 62.3% in the study groups as a whole.

===Darker skin color===
It has been suggested the reduced [[pigmentation]] of light-skinned individuals results in higher vitamin D levels<ref name="Heaney_2004" /> and that, because [[melanin]] acts like a sun-block, dark-[[Human skin color|skinned]] individuals, in particular, may require extra vitamin D to avoid deficiency at higher latitudes.

==Diagnosis==

The serum concentration of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D is typically used to determine vitamin D status. It reflects vitamin D produced in the skin as well as that acquired from the diet, and has a fairly long circulating half-life of 15 days. It does not, however, reveal the amount of vitamin D stored in other body tissues. The level of serum 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D is not usually used to determine vitamin D status because it has a short half-life of 15 hours and is tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate, such that it does not decrease significantly until vitamin D deficiency is already well advanced.<ref name="FactD"/>

One study found that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> raised 25-hydroxy-vitamin D blood levels more than did vitamin D2,<ref name="pmid21177785">{{cite journal|author=Heaney RP, Recker RR, Grote J, Horst RL, Armas LA| title=Vitamin D(3) is more potent than vitamin D(2) in humans | journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab | year= 2011 | volume= 96 | issue= 3 | pages= E447–52 | pmid=21177785 | doi=10.1210/jc.2010-2230 | pmc=}}</ref> but this difference has been adequately disproved to allow reasonable assumption that D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> are equal for maintaining 25-hydroxy-vitamin D status.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Holick MF, Biancuzzo RM, Chen TC, Klein EK, Young A, Bibuld D, Reitz R, Salameh W, Ameri A, Tannenbaum AD |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab | title=Vitamin D2 Is as Effective as Vitamin D3 in Maintaining Circulating Concentrations of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D |year=2008 | volume=93 | issue=3 | pages=677–81 | pmid=18089691 | doi=10.1210/jc.2007-2308 | pmc=2266966}}</ref>

There has been variability in results of laboratory analyses of the level of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D. Falsely low or high values have been obtained depending on the particular test or laboratory used. Beginning in July 2009 a standard reference material became available which should allow laboratories to standardise their procedures.<ref name="FactD"/>

There is some disagreement concerning the exact levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D needed for good health. A level lower than 10&nbsp;ng/mL (25&nbsp;nmol/L) is associated with the most severe deficiency diseases: rickets in infants and children, and [[osteomalacia]] in adults. A concentration above 15&nbsp;ng/ml (37.5 nmol/L) is generally considered adequate for those in good health. Levels above 30&nbsp;ng/ml (75&nbsp;nmol/L) are proposed by some as desirable for achieving optimum health, but there is not yet enough evidence to support this.<ref name="FactD"/><ref name="autogenerated307">{{cite journal |pmid=20194237 |year=2010|month = March |last1=Pittas |first1=AG |last2=Chung |first2=M |last3=Trikalinos|first3=T |last4=Mitri |first4=J |last5=Brendel |first5=M |last6=Patel |first6=K |last7=Lichtenstein |first7=AH |last8=Lau |first8=J |last9=Balk|first9=EM |title=Systematic review: Vitamin D and cardiometabolic outcomes |volume=152 |issue=5 |pages=307–14  |journal=[[Annals of Internal Medicine]] |doi=10.1059/0003-4819-152-5-201003020-00009 |pmc=3211092}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated315">{{cite journal |pmid=20194238 |year=2010|month = March|last1=Wang |first1=L |last2=Manson |first2=JE |last3=Song |first3=Y |last4=Sesso |first4=HD |title=Systematic review: Vitamin D and calcium supplementation in prevention of cardiovascular events |volume=152 |issue=5 |pages=315–23 |journal=[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]|doi=10.1059/0003-4819-152-5-201003020-00010 }}</ref>

Levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D that are consistently above 200&nbsp;ng/mL (500&nbsp;nmol/L) are thought to be potentially toxic, although data from humans are sparse. In animal studies levels up to 400&nbsp;ng/mL (1,000&nbsp;nmol/L) were not associated with toxicity.<ref name="FactD"/> Vitamin D toxicity usually results from taking supplements in excess. [[Hypercalcemia]] is typically the cause of symptoms, and levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D above 150&nbsp;ng/mL (375&nbsp;nmol/L) are usually found, although in some cases 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels may appear to be normal. It is recommended to periodically measure serum calcium in individuals receiving large doses of vitamin D.<ref name="Merck" />

A randomized intervention study involving 1,200 women, published in June 2007, reports that vitamin D supplementation (1,100&nbsp;international units (IU)/day) resulted in a 60% reduction in cancer incidence, during a four-year clinical trial, rising to a 77% reduction for cancers diagnosed ''after'' the first year (and therefore excluding those cancers more likely to have originated prior to the vitamin D intervention).<ref name="GlobeAndMail">{{cite news| author= Martin Mittelstaedt| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070428.wxvitamin28/BNStory/specialScienceandHealth/home | title=Vitamin D casts cancer prevention in new light | work=Global and Mail |date=28 April 2007| accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17556697 |year=2007 |last1=Lappe |first1=JM |last2=Travers-Gustafson |first2=D |last3=Davies |first3=KM |last4=Recker |first4=RR |last5=Heaney |first5=RP |title=Vitamin D and calcium supplementation reduces cancer risk: results of a randomized trial |volume=85 |issue=6 |pages=1586–91 |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}</ref> The study was criticized on several grounds<ref name="Lappe critique">{{cite journal |pmid=18065602 |year=2007 |last1=Ojha |first1=RP |last2=Felini |first2=MJ |last3=Fischbach |first3=LA |title=Vitamin D for cancer prevention: valid assertion or premature anointment? |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=1804–5; author reply 1805–6 |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}</ref> including lack of data, use of statistical techniques and comparison with a self-selected (i.e. non-randomized) observational study that found long term  convergence of breast cancer incidence<ref name="autogenerated316">{{cite journal |pmid=17549593 |year=2007 |last1=Robien |first1=K |last2=Cutler |first2=GJ |last3=Lazovich |first3=D |title=Vitamin D intake and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women: the Iowa Women's Health Study |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=775–82 |doi=10.1007/s10552-007-9020-x |journal=Cancer causes & control}}</ref> The author's response provided the required data, explained their statistical usage and commented that even if the vitamin D merely delayed the appearance of cancer (which they did not believe, based on other studies), that that was still a considerable benefit.<ref name="Lappe critique"/>

A study by Cedric F. Garland and [[Frank C. Garland]] of the [[University of California, San Diego]] analyzed the blood from 25,000 volunteers from [[Washington County, Maryland]], finding that those with the highest levels of [[Calcifediol]] had one-fifth the risk of [[colon cancer]] compared to typical rates.<ref>Maugh II, Thomas H.
