'''Chronic venous insufficiency''' or CVI is a medical condition where the veins cannot pump enough oxygen-poor blood back to the heart.<ref name="vascular-web">{{cite web |url=http://www.vascularweb.org/vascularhealth/Pages/chronic-venous-insufficiency.aspx |title=Chronic Venous Insufficiency |publisher=Society for Vascular Surgery |date=December 1, 2009}}</ref> It is sometimes referred to as an "impaired musculovenous pump", this is due to damaged or "incompetent" valves as may occur after [[deep vein thrombosis]] (when the disease is called [[postthrombotic syndrome]]) or [[phlebitis]]. Ordinarily, women make up the largest demographic for this problem. Paratroopers, utility pole linemen, and men with leg injuries can suffer from damaged leg vein valves and develop this condition. 

==Venous insufficiency in the legs==
[[File:Venous valve.png|right|thumb|210px|Venous valves prevent reverse blood flow.]]
As functional venous valves are required to provide for efficient blood return from the lower extremities, CVI often occurs in the veins of the legs. Itching (pruritus) is sometimes a symptom, along with hyperpigmentation of the legs. Symptoms of CVI include phlebetic lymphedema and chronic swelling of the legs and ankles. The skin may react with [[varicose eczema]], local inflammation, discoloration, thickening, and an increased risk of [[Venous insufficiency ulceration|ulcers]] and [[cellulitis]]. The condition has been known since ancient times and Hippocrates used bandaging to treat it. It is better described as ''chronic peripheral venous insufficiency''.

Venous valve incompetence is treated conservatively with manual compression lymphatic massage therapy, skin lubrication,  sequential compression pump, ankle pump, compression stockings, blood pressure medicine, frequent periods of rest elevating the legs above the heart level and using a 20 cm (7-inch) bed wedge during sleep. Surgical treatments include the old [[Linton procedure]]s and the newer [[subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery]]. Some experimental valve repair or valve transposition procedures as well as some hemodynamic surgeries are being pursued. This whole field of medicine while ancient is still filled with complications e.g. Sometimes an artery can strangulate a vein or sometimes an arteriovenous fistula (an abnormal connection or passageway between an artery and a vein) may be causing the apparent poor venous return.

Patients are often encouraged to walk while wearing the prescribed medical stockings and to sleep in a 6 degree [[Trendelenburg position]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Obese or pregnant patients might be advised by their physicians to forgo the tilted bed.

===May-Thurner syndrome===
{{main|May-Thurner syndrome}}
In medicine, May-Thurner syndrome is a rare condition in which blood clots, called [[deep venous thrombosis]] (DVT), occur in the iliofemoral vein due to compression of the blood vessels in the leg. The specific problem is compression of the left common iliac vein by the overlying right common iliac artery.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This leads to pooling or stasis of blood, predisposing the individual to the formation of blood clots.

==Venous insufficiency in the central nervous system==
{{main|Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency}}
CVI has been reported in the CNS of several persons.<ref name=pmid19060024>{{cite journal |last1=Zamboni |first1=P |last2=Galeotti |first2=R |last3=Menegatti |first3=E |last4=Malagoni |first4=A M |last5=Tacconi |first5=G |last6=Dall'ara |first6=S |last7=Bartolomei |first7=I |last8=Salvi |first8=F |title=Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=80 |pages=392–9 |year=2008 |pmc=2647682 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2008.157164 |pmid=19060024 |issue=4}}</ref> When it appears into the CNS is called [[Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency]] (CCSVI). It can be seen using [[Transcranial doppler]] [[sonography]] or [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MRV]] (magnetic resonance venography)

This disease was only recently described (2006) and the first international symposium took place on September 8, 2009 in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]]. The causes of venous insufficiencies were discussed, and it was mostly shown that it is due to [[stenosis|venous stenosis]] which is subsequently due to genetics or embryonic problems.<ref>Bologna conference notes [http://www.keepandshare.com/doc/view.php?id=1370985&da=y]{{MEDRS|date=November 2010}}</ref>

The known consequences of the disease are [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], delayed [[perfusion]] and [[Human iron metabolism|iron]] deposits in the blood vessels, with unknown final effects for the health of the patients. A connection with [[Multiple sclerosis|MS]] has been proposed (all cases of CCSVI were found in MS patients<ref name=pmid19060024/>) but the possible relationship is still under study.

It can be treated currently in two ways: [[Angioplasty|Balloons]] to open the veins, in the hope they will remain open, and [[stent|venous stents]], to keep them open permanently.

Other research groups have found jugular veins reflux in other neurological diseases. In particular in Transient Global Amnesia,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chung |first1=C |last2=Hsu |first2=H |last3=Chao |first3=A |last4=Sheng |first4=W |last5=Soong |first5=B |last6=Hu |first6=H |title=Transient Global Amnesia: Cerebral Venous Outflow Impairment—Insight from the Abnormal Flow Patterns of the Internal Jugular Vein |journal=Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology |volume=33 |pages=1727–35 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2007.05.018 |issue=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chung |first1=C |last2=Hsu |first2=H |last3=Chao |first3=A |last4=Wong |first4=W |last5=Sheng |first5=W |last6=Hu |first6=H |title=Flow Volume in the Jugular Vein and Related Hemodynamics in the Branches of the Jugular Vein |journal=Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology |volume=33 |pages=500–5 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2006.10.009 |issue=4}}</ref> Leukoaraiosis,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chung |first1=Chih-Ping |last2=Hu |first2=Han-Hwa |title=Pathogenesis of leukoaraiosis: Role of jugular venous reflux |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=85–90 |year=2010 |pmid=20172657 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2010.01.042}}</ref> and general myelopathies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leriche |first1=H |last2=Aubin |first2=ML |last3=Aboulker |first3=J |title=Cavo-spinal phlebography in myelopathies.

Supplementum |volume=347 |pages=415–7 |year=1976 |pmid=207127}}</ref> All of them have been linked to venous reflux with different names like Cerebral Venous Outflow Impairment. At this moment is unknown if these conditions can be considered related to CCSVI.

==Venous insufficiency in the liver==
{{main|Budd–Chiari syndrome}}
Budd–Chiari syndrome is the condition caused by [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] of the [[hepatic veins]]. It presents with the classical triad of abdominal pain, [[ascites]] and [[hepatomegaly]]. Examples of occlusion include thrombosis of hepatic veins. The syndrome can be fulminant, acute, chronic, or asymptomatic. It occurs in 1 out of a million individuals<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rajani |first1=Rupesh |last2=Melin |first2=Tor |last3=Björnsson |first3=Einar |last4=Broomé |first4=Ulrika |last5=Sangfelt |first5=Per |last6=Danielsson |first6=Åke |last7=Gustavsson |first7=Anders |last8=Grip |first8=Olof |last9=Svensson |first9=Hans |title=Budd-Chiari syndrome in Sweden: epidemiology, clinical characteristics and survival – an 18-year experience |journal=Liver International |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=253–9 |year=2009 |pmid=18694401 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-3231.2008.01838.x}}</ref> and is more common in females. Some 10–20% also have obstruction of the portal vein.

Any obstruction of the [[vein|venous]] vasculature of the liver is referred to as Budd-Chiari syndrome, from the [[venule]]s to the [[right atrium]]. This leads to increased portal vein and hepatic sinusoid pressures as the blood flow stagnates. The increased portal pressure causes: 1) increased filtration of vascular fluid with the formation of protein-rich ascites in the abdomen; and 2) collateral venous flow through alternative veins leading to gastric varices and hemorrhoids. Obstruction also causes centrilobular necrosis and peripheral lobule fatty change due to ischemia. If this condition persists chronically what is known as [[Nutmeg liver]] will develop. Renal failure may occur, perhaps due to the body sensing an "underfill" state and subsequent activation of the renin-angiotensin pathways and excess sodium retention.
