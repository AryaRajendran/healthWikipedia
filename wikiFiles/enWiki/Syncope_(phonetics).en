In [[phonology]], '''syncope''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|ɪ|ŋ|k|ə|p|iː}}; Greek: ''syn-'' + ''koptein'' “to strike, cut off”) is the loss of one or more sounds from the interior of a word, especially the loss of an unstressed vowel. It is found both 
in [[synchronic analysis]] of languages and [[diachronics]] .

==Found synchronically==
Synchronic analysis is an analysis that views linguistic phenomena only at one point in time. Usually, the present. We find syncope happening within the functioning of modern languages. Here we consider it in three areas :
Inflection, Poetry, and Informal Speech.

==In inflections==
In languages such as [[Irish language|Irish]], the process of [[inflection]] can [[precipitate]] syncope.

For example :

* In some verbs
:Imir (To play) should become *"imirím" (I play). However the addition of the "-ím" causes syncope and the second last syllable vowel "i" is lost. So, Imir becomes Imrím.
* In some nouns
:Inis (Island) should become *inise in the [[genitive case]]. However, if one looks at road signs one finds not *"Baile na hInise", but "Baile na hInse" (The town of the Island). Once again the loss is of the second syllable "i".

It is interesting that if the present root form in Irish is the result of diachronic syncope then there is a resistance to synchronic syncope for [[inflection]]. Historically in old Irish, as a rule, syncope happened whenever the addition of an ending gave rise to syncope.

==As a poetic device==
Sounds may be removed from the interior of a word as a rhetorical or poetic device, whether for embellishment or for the sake of the meter.

*Latin ''commo[ve]rat'' > poetic ''commorat'' ("he had moved")
*English ''hast[e]ning'' > poetic ''hast'ning''
*English ''heav[e]n'' > poetic ''heav'n''
*English ''over'' > poetic ''o'er''
*English ''never'' > poetic ''ne'er''

==Syncope in informal speech== <!-- linked from [[Compression (phonetics)]] -->
Various sorts of colloquial reductions might be called "syncope". It is also called '''compression'''.<ref>

Forms such as "didn't" that are written with an apostrophe are, however, generally called [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]]:

*English ''[Au]stra[lia]n'' > colloquial ''[[Strine]]''
*English ''did n[o]t'' > ''di[d]n't''
*English ''I [woul]d [ha]ve'' > ''I'd've''

==Found diachronically as a historical sound change==
In historical phonetics, the term "syncope" is often but not always limited to the loss of an unstressed vowel:

===Loss of any sound===
*Old English ''hláford'' > English ''lord''
*English ''Worcester'', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʊ|s|t|ər}}
*English ''Gloucester'', pronounced {{IPA|/ˈɡlɒstər/}}

===Loss of an unstressed vowel===
*Latin ''cál[i]dum'' > Italian ''caldo'' "hot"
*Latin ''óc[u]lum'' > Italian ''occhio'' "eye"
*Latin ''trem[u]láre'' > Italian ''tremare'' "to tremble"
