'''Glutathione synthetase deficiency''' is a rare [[autosomal]] [[recessive]]<ref>{{cite journal |pages=384–9 |doi=10.1007/s00439-005-1255-6 |title=Genotype, enzyme activity, glutathione level, and clinical phenotype in patients with glutathione synthetase deficiency |year=2005 |last1=Njålsson |first1=Runa |last2=Ristoff |first2=Ellinor |last3=Carlsson |first3=Katarina |last4=Winkler |first4=Andreas |last5=Larsson |first5=Agne |last6=Norgren |first6=Svante |journal=Human Genetics |volume=116 |issue=5 |pmid=15717202}}</ref> [[metabolic disorder]] that prevents the production of [[glutathione]]. Glutathione helps prevent damage to cells by neutralizing harmful molecules generated during energy production. Glutathione also plays a role in processing medications and cancer-causing compounds ([[carcinogen]]s), and building [[DNA]], proteins, and other important cellular components.

==Diagnosis==
Glutathione synthetase deficiency can be classified into three types: mild, moderate and severe.<ref name="Pmid">{{cite journal |pages=1938–45 |doi=10.1007/s00018-005-5163-7 |title=Glutathione synthetase deficiency |year=2005 |last1=Njålsson |first1=R. |journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |volume=62 |issue=17 |pmid=15990954}}</ref> 
* ''Mild'' glutathione synthetase deficiency usually results in the destruction of red blood cells ([[hemolytic anemia]]). Rarely, affected people also excrete large amounts of a compound called [[pyroglutamic acid|5-oxoproline]] (also called pyroglutamic acid, or pyroglutamate) in their urine (5-oxoprolinuria). This compound builds up when glutathione is not processed correctly in cells.<ref name="Pmid" />

* Individuals with ''moderate'' glutathione synthetase deficiency may experience symptoms beginning shortly after birth including hemolytic anemia, 5-oxoprolinuria, and elevated acidity in the blood and tissues ([[metabolic acidosis]]). 

* In addition to the features present in moderate glutathione synthetase deficiency, individuals affected by the ''severe'' form of this disorder may experience neurological symptoms. These problems may include [[seizure]]s; a generalized slowing down of physical reactions, movements, and speech ([[psychomotor retardation]]); [[mental retardation]]; and a loss of coordination ([[ataxia]]). Some people with severe glutathione synthetase deficiency also develop recurrent bacterial infections.

==Genetics==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Glutathione synthetase deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

Mutations in the ''GSS'' gene cause glutathione synthetase deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making the [[enzyme]] [[glutathione synthetase]]. This enzyme is involved in a process called the [[gamma-glutamyl cycle]], which takes place in most of the body's cells. This cycle is necessary for producing a molecule called glutathione. Glutathione protects cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules, which are byproducts of energy production. Glutathione is called an [[antioxidant]] because of its role in protecting cells from the damaging effects of these unstable molecules which are byproducts of energy production. Mutations in the ''GSS'' gene prevent cells from making adequate levels of glutathione, leading to the signs and symptoms of glutathione synthetase deficiency. 

This disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the gene - one from each parent - are required to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder each carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually are not affected by the disorder.
