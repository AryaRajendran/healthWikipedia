'''Metabolic syndrome''' is a combination of [[medicine|medical]] disorders that, when occurring together, increase the risk of developing [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/metabolicsyndrome.html MedlinePlus: Metabolic Syndrome<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some studies have shown the [[prevalence]] in the USA to be an estimated 25% of the population,<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.287.3.356 | author = Ford ES, Giles WH, Dietz WH | year = 2002 | title = Prevalence of metabolic syndrome among US adults: findings from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 287 | issue = 3| pages = 356–359 | pmid = 11790215 }}</ref> and prevalence increases with age.

Metabolic syndrome is also known as '''metabolic syndrome X''', '''cardiometabolic syndrome''', '''syndrome X''', '''insulin resistance syndrome''', '''Reaven's syndrome''' (named for [[Gerald Reaven]]), and '''CHAOS''' (in Australia).<ref>In his [http://www.agale.com.au/CFS.htm case studies poster] presented at the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Conference in Sydney, Australia (February 12–13, 1998), Dr Allen E. Gale, Consultant Physician (Allergy), identifies the acronym CHAOS as an abbreviation for Coronary artery disease, Hypertension, Atherosclerosis, Obesity, and Stroke.</ref>

== Definitions and diagnosis ==
Currently, two sets of defining criteria for metabolic syndrome are set out by two different sources: the [[International Diabetes Federation]]<ref name="idf.org">The IDF consensus worldwide definition of the metabolic syndrome. [http://www.idf.org/webdata/docs/IDF_Meta_def_final.pdf PDF]</ref> and the revised [[National Cholesterol Education Program]]. These are very similar and they identify individuals with a given set of symptoms as having metabolic syndrome. There are two differences, however: the IDF definition states that if [[body mass index]] (BMI) is greater than 30&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, [[central obesity]] can be assumed, and waist circumference does not need to be measured.  However, this potentially excludes any subject without increased waist circumference if BMI is less than 30. Conversely, the NCEP definition indicates that metabolic syndrome can be diagnosed based on other criteria. Also, the IDF uses geography-specific cut points for waist circumference, while NCEP uses only one set of cut points for waist circumference regardless of geography. These two definitions are much more similar than the original NCEP and WHO definitions.

===IDF===
The [[International Diabetes Federation]]<ref name="idf.org"/> consensus worldwide definition of the metabolic syndrome (2006) is:
Central obesity (defined as waist circumference<sup>#</sup> with ethnicity-specific values) AND any two of the following:
* Raised triglycerides: > 150&nbsp;mg/dL (1.7&nbsp;mmol/L), or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality
* Reduced [[HDL cholesterol]]:  < 40&nbsp;mg/dL (1.03&nbsp;mmol/L) in males, < 50&nbsp;mg/dL (1.29&nbsp;mmol/L) in females, or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality
* Raised blood pressure (BP): systolic BP > 130 or diastolic BP >85&nbsp;mm Hg, or treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension
* Raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG): >100&nbsp;mg/dL (5.6&nbsp;mmol/L), or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes
If FPG is >5.6&nbsp;mmol/L or 100&nbsp;mg/dL, an oral [[glucose tolerance test]] is strongly recommended, but is not necessary to define presence of the syndrome.
<br/><sup>#</sup> If BMI is >30&nbsp;kg/m², central obesity can be assumed and waist circumference does not need to be measured

===WHO===
The [[World Health Organization]] 1999 criteria<ref>{{cite web|last=Alberti|first=KGMM|title=Definition, Diagnosis, and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus and its Complications|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1999/who_ncd_ncs_99.2.pdf,|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=25 March 2013|coauthors=Zimmet|pages=32-33|language=English|year=1999}}</ref>  require the presence of any one of diabetes mellitus, impaired [[glucose tolerance]], impaired fasting glucose or [[insulin resistance]], AND two of the following:
* Blood pressure: ≥ 140/90 mmHg
* [[Dyslipidemia]]: triglycerides (TG): ≥ 1.695&nbsp;mmol/L  and high-density [[lipoprotein]] cholesterol (HDL-C) ≤ 0.9&nbsp;mmol/L (male), ≤ 1.0&nbsp;mmol/L (female)
* Central obesity: waist:hip ratio > 0.90 (male); > 0.85 (female), or body mass index > 30&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>
* [[Microalbuminuria]]: urinary albumin excretion ratio ≥ 20&nbsp;µg/min or albumin:creatinine ratio ≥ 30&nbsp;mg/g

===EGIR===
The [[European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance]] (1999) requires insulin resistance defined as the top 25% of the fasting insulin values among nondiabetic individuals AND two or more of the following:
* Central obesity: waist circumference ≥ 94&nbsp;cm (male), ≥ 80&nbsp;cm (female)
* Dyslipidemia: TG ≥ 2.0&nbsp;mmol/L and/or HDL-C < 1.0&nbsp;mmol/L or treated for dyslipidemia
* Hypertension: blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg or antihypertensive medication
* Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 6.1&nbsp;mmol/L

===NCEP===
The US National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (2001) requires at least three of the following:<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults | last1 = Expert Panel On Detection, Evaluation, And Treatment Of High Blood Cholesterol In Adults | title = Executive Summary of the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) | pmid = 11368702 | journal = JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association | volume=285 | issue=19 | year=2001 | month=May | pages=2486–97 | doi=10.1001/jama.285.19.2486}}</ref>
* Central obesity: waist circumference ≥ 102&nbsp;cm or 40&nbsp;inches (male), ≥ 88&nbsp;cm or 36&nbsp;inches(female)
* Dyslipidemia: TG ≥ 1.7&nbsp;mmol/L (150&nbsp;mg/dl)
* Dyslipidemia: HDL-C < 40&nbsp;mg/dL (male), < 50&nbsp;mg/dL (female)
* Blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg
* Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 6.1&nbsp;mmol/L (110&nbsp;mg/dl)

===American Heart Association/Updated NCEP===
There is confusion as to whether, in 2004, the AHA/NHLBI intended to create another set of guidelines or simply update the NCEP ATP III definition.  According to Scott Grundy, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, Texas, the intent was just to update the NCEP ATP III definition and not create a new definition.<ref name="Grundy">[http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/109/3/433.pdf Grundy SM, Brewer HB, Cleeman JI, Smith SC, Lenfant D, for the Conference Participants.

===Other===
[[C-reactive protein|High-sensitivity C-reactive protein]] has been developed and used as a marker to predict coronary vascular diseases in metabolic syndrome, and it was recently used as a predictor for [[NAFLD|nonalcoholic fatty liver disease]] in correlation with serum markers that indicated lipid and glucose metabolism.<ref name="pmid19271113">{{cite journal |author=Kogiso T, Moriyoshi Y, Shimizu S, Nagahara H, Shiratori K |title=High-sensitivity C-reactive protein as a serum predictor of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease based on the Akaike Information Criterion scoring system in the general Japanese population |journal=[[J.

==History==
The term "metabolic syndrome" dates back to at least the late 1950s, but came into common usage in the late 1970s to describe various associations of risk factors with diabetes that had been noted as early as the 1920s.<ref>Joslin EP. The prevention of diabetes mellitus. ''JAMA'' 1921;76:79–84.</ref><ref>Kylin E. [Studies of the hypertension-hyperglycemia-hyperuricemia syndrome] (German). ''Zentralbl Inn Med'' 1923;44: 105-27.</ref>
* The Marseilles physician Dr. Jean Vague, in 1947, observed that upper body obesity appeared to predispose to [[diabetes]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[gout]] and [[Calculus (medicine)|calculi]].<ref>Vague J. La diffférenciacion sexuelle, facteur déterminant des formes de l'obésité. Presse Med 1947;30:339-40.</ref>
* Avogadro, Crepaldi and coworkers described six moderately obese patients with diabetes, [[hypercholesterolemia]], and marked [[hypertriglyceridemia]], all of which improved when the patients were put on a hypocaloric, low-carbohydrate diet.<ref>Avogadro A, Crepaldi G, Enzi G, Tiengo A. Associazione di iperlipidemia, diabete mellito e obesità di medio grado. ''Acta Diabetol Lat'' 1967;4:572-590.<!--No PMID--></ref>
* In 1977, Haller used the term "metabolic syndrome" for associations of [[obesity]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hyperlipoproteinemia]], [[hyperuricemia]], and [[hepatic steatosis]] when describing the additive effects of risk factors on atherosclerosis.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 883354 | volume=32 | issue=8 | journal = Zeitschrift fur die gesamte innere Medizin und ihre Grenzgebiete | year=1977 | title = Epidermiology and associated risk factors of hyperlipoproteinemia. | month=April | pages=124–8 | author=Haller H}}</ref>
* The same year, Singer used the term for associations of obesity, gout, diabetes mellitus, and [[hypertension]] with hyperlipoproteinemia.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 906591 | volume=32 | issue=9 | journal = Zeitschrift fur die gesamte innere Medizin und ihre Grenzgebiete | year=1977 | title = Diagnosis of primary hyperlipoproteinemias. | month=May | pages=129–33 concl | author=Singer P}}</ref>
* In 1977 and 1978, Gerald B. Phillips developed the concept that risk factors for [[myocardial infarction]] concur to form a "constellation of abnormalities" (i.e., [[glucose intolerance]], [[hyperinsulinemia]], [[hypercholesterolemia]], [[hypertriglyceridemia]], and hypertension) associated not only with heart disease, but also with aging, obesity and other clinical states. He suggested there must be an underlying linking factor, the identification of which could lead to the prevention of cardiovascular disease; he hypothesized that this factor was [[sex hormones]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 356599 | volume=65 | issue=1 | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | year=1978 | title = Sex hormones, risk factors and cardiovascular disease. | month=July | pages=7–11 | author=Phillips GB | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(78)90685-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 193114 | volume=74 | issue=4 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | year=1977 | title = Relationship between serum sex hormones and glucose, insulin and lipid abnormalities in men with myocardial infarction | month=April | pages=1729–33 | author=Phillips GB | pmc = 430867 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.74.4.1729}}</ref>
* In 1988, in his [[Banting Lectures|Banting lecture]], [[Gerald M. Reaven]] proposed [[insulin resistance]] as the underlying factor and named the constellation of abnormalities syndrome X. Reaven did not include abdominal obesity, which has also been hypothesized as the underlying factor, as part of the condition.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2337/diabetes.37.12.1595 | author = Reaven  | year = 1988 | title = Role of [[insulin resistance]] in human disease | url = | journal = Diabetes | volume = 37 | issue = 12| pages = 1595–607 | pmid = 3056758 }}</ref>

The terms "metabolic syndrome," "insulin resistance syndrome," and "syndrome X" are now used specifically to define a constellation of abnormalities associated with increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular disease (e.g., heart disease and stroke).

==Etiology==
The exact mechanisms of the complex pathways of metabolic syndrome are not yet completely known. The [[pathophysiology]] is very complex and has been only partially elucidated. Most patients are older, obese, sedentary, and have a degree of [[insulin resistance]]. [[Stress (biology)|Stress]] can also be a contributing factor. The most important factors are weight, genetics,<ref>{{Cite journal

There is debate regarding whether obesity or insulin resistance is the cause of the metabolic syndrome or if they are consequences of a more far-reaching metabolic derangement. A number of markers of systemic [[inflammation]], including [[C-reactive protein]], are often increased, as are [[fibrinogen]], [[interleukin 6]], [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]]&nbsp;(TNFα), and others. Some have pointed to a variety of causes, including increased [[uric acid]] levels caused by dietary [[fructose]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Nakagawa T, Hu H, Zharikov S, Tuttle KR, Short RA, Glushakova O, Ouyang X, Feig DI, Block ER, Herrera-Acosta J, Patel JM, Johnson RJ | title=A causal role for uric acid in fructose-induced metabolic syndrome | journal=Am J Phys Renal Phys | year=2006 | volume=290 | issue=3 | pages= F625&ndash;F631 | pmid=16234313 | doi=10.1152/ajprenal.00140.2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Hallfrisch J | title=Metabolic effects of dietary fructose | journal=FASEB J | year=1990 | volume=4 | issue=9 | pages= 2652&ndash;2660 | pmid=2189777}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Reiser S, Powell AS, Scholfield DJ, Panda P, Ellwood KC, Canary JJ | title=Blood lipids, lipoproteins, apoproteins, and uric acid in men fed diets containing fructose or high-amylose cornstarch | journal= Am J Clin Nutr | year=1989 | volume=49 | issue=5 | pages= 832&ndash;839 | pmid=2497634}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
It is common for there to be a development of [[visceral fat]], after which the [[adipocyte]]s (fat cells) of the visceral fat increase [[blood plasma|plasma]] levels of TNFα and alter levels of a number of other substances (e.g., [[adiponectin]], [[resistin]], and [[PAI-1]]). TNFα has been shown not only to cause the production of inflammatory [[cytokine]]s, but also possibly to trigger cell signaling by interaction with a TNFα [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] that may lead to insulin resistance.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hotamisligil GS. | title=The Role of TNF-alpha and TNF receptors in Obesity and Insulin Resistance | journal=Journal of Internal Medicine | date=1999 June. | volume=245 | issue=6 | pages= 621&ndash;625 | pmid=10395191 }}</ref> An experiment with rats fed a diet with 33% [[sucrose]] has been proposed as a model for the development of metabolic syndrome.

The increase in adipose tissue also increases the number of immune cells present within, which play a role in inflammation. Chronic inflammation contributes to an increased risk of hypertension, artherosclerosis and diabetes.<ref>Whitney, Ellie and Ralfes, R. Sharon. 2011. Understanding Nutrition. Wadsworth Cengage Learning: Belmont, CA</ref>

==Risk factors==
===Stress===
Recent research indicates prolonged [[Stress (biology)|stress]] can be an underlying cause of metabolic syndrome by upsetting the hormonal balance of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA-axis).<ref name="Gohill">{{cite journal

</ref>
A dysfunctional HPA-axis causes high [[cortisol]] levels to circulate, which results in raising [[glucose]] and [[insulin]] levels, which in turn cause insulin-mediated effects on adipose tissue, ultimately promoting [[visceral adiposity]], insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension, with direct effects on the bone, causing "low turnover" [[osteoporosis]].<ref name="tsigos">{{cite journal

===Overweight and obesity===
{{Main|Central obesity}}
[[Central obesity]] is a key feature of the syndrome, reflecting the fact that the syndrome's prevalence is driven by the strong relationship between [[waist]] [[circumference]] and increasing adiposity. However, despite the importance of obesity, patients who are of normal weight may also be [[Insulin resistance|insulin-resistant]] and have the syndrome.<ref name="isbn0-07-147692-X">{{cite book |author=Fauci, Anthony S. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine |edition= |language= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location= |year=2008 |origyear= |pages= |quote= |isbn=0-07-147692-X |oclc= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Sedentary lifestyle===
[[Sedentary lifestyle|Physical inactivity]] is a predictor of [[cardiovascular disease|CVD]] events and related [[Death|mortality]]. Many components of metabolic syndrome are associated with a sedentary lifestyle, including increased adipose tissue (predominantly [[Central obesity|central]]); reduced [[HDL cholesterol]]; and a trend toward increased [[triglycerides]], [[hypertension|blood pressure]], and [[glucose]] in the genetically susceptible. Compared with individuals who watched [[television]] or [[Videotape|videos]] or used their [[computer]]s for less than one hour daily, those who carried out these behaviors for greater than four hours daily have a twofold increased [[risk]] of metabolic syndrome.<ref name="isbn0-07-147692-X"/>

===Aging===
Metabolic syndrome affects 44% of the U.S. population older than age 50. With respect to that demographic, the percentage of women having the syndrome is higher than that of men. The age dependency of the syndrome's prevalence is seen in most populations around the world.<ref name="isbn0-07-147692-X"/>

===Diabetes mellitus===
{{main|Diabetes mellitus}}

===Coronary heart disease===
{{main|Coronary disease}}
The approximate prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in patients with [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD) is 50%, with a prevalence of 37% in patients with premature [[coronary artery disease]] (age 45), particularly in women. With appropriate [[Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation|cardiac rehabilitation]] and changes in [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] (e.g., [[nutrition]], [[physical activity]], [[weight]] reduction, and, in some cases, [[drugs]]), the prevalence of the syndrome can be reduced.<ref name="isbn0-07-147692-X"/>

===Lipodystrophy===
{{main|Lipodystrophy}}
Lipodystrophic disorders in general are associated with metabolic syndrome. Both genetic (e.g., [[Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy]], [[Dunnigan familial partial lipodystrophy]]) and [[acquired]] (e.g., [[HIV]]-related [[lipodystrophy]] in patients treated with highly active [[antiretroviral therapy]]) forms of lipodystrophy may give rise to severe [[insulin resistance]] and many of metabolic syndrome's components.<ref name="isbn0-07-147692-X"/>

===Schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses===
Patients with [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]] or [[bipolar disorder]] may have a predisposition to metabolic syndrome that is [[exacerbate]]d by sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary habits, possible limited access to care, and antipsychotic drug-induced adverse effects. It has been found that 32% and 51%<ref>{{cite PMID|19220180}}</ref> of individuals with schizophrenia meet criteria for metabolic syndrome; the prevalence is higher in women than in men.<ref>Narasimhan M, Raynor JD. [http://dbt.consultantlive.com/health-care-reform/content/article/1145628/1555034 Evidence-based perspective on metabolic syndrome and use of antipsychotics]. Drug Benefit Trends. 2010;22:77-88.</ref>

===Rheumatic diseases===
There are new findings regarding the comorbidity associated with rheumatic diseases. Both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have been found to be associated with metabolic syndrome.<ref>Quilon A III, Brent L. [http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/display/article/1145622/1579185 The primary care physician's guide to inflammatory arthritis: diagnosis]. J Musculoskel Med. 2010;27:223-231.</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms and features are:
* Fasting [[hyperglycemia]] &mdash; [[diabetes mellitus type 2]] or [[impaired fasting glucose]], [[impaired glucose tolerance]], or [[insulin resistance]]
* [[High blood pressure]]
* [[Central obesity]] (also known as visceral, male-pattern or apple-shaped adiposity), overweight with fat deposits mainly around the waist
* Decreased [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]] cholesterol
* Elevated [[triglyceride]]s

Associated diseases and signs are: [[hyperuricemia]], [[fatty liver]] (especially in concurrent [[obesity]]) progressing to [[NAFLD]], [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]] (in women), and [[acanthosis nigricans]].

==Prevention==
Various strategies have been proposed to prevent the development of metabolic syndrome. These include increased physical activity (such as walking 30 minutes every day),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lakka TA, Laaksonen DE |title=Physical activity in prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome |journal=Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquée, nutrition et métabolisme |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=76–88 |year=2007 |pmid=17332786 |doi=10.1139/h06-113}}</ref> and a healthy, reduced calorie diet.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Feldeisen SE, Tucker KL |title=Nutritional strategies in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome |journal=Appl Physiol Nutr Metab |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=46–60 |year=2007 |pmid=17332784 |doi=10.1139/h06-101}}</ref>  Many studies support the value of a healthy lifestyle as above. However, one study stated these potentially beneficial measures are effective in only a minority of people, primarily due to a lack of compliance with lifestyle and diet changes.<ref name="katzmaryk" /> The [[International Obesity Taskforce]] states that interventions on a sociopolitical level are required to reduce development of the metabolic syndrome in populations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=James PT, Rigby N, Leach R |title=The obesity epidemic, metabolic syndrome and future prevention strategies |journal=Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=3–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15167200| doi = 10.1097/01.hjr.0000114707.27531.48}}</ref>

A 2007 study of 2,375 male subjects over 20 years suggested the daily intake of a pint (~568 ml) of milk or equivalent dairy products more than halved the risk of metabolic syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Elwood |first=PC |coauthors=Pickering JE, Fehily AM |year=2007 |title=Milk and dairy consumption, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome: the Caerphilly prospective study |journal= J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=695–698 |pmid=17630368  |url=http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/61/8/695 |pmc=2652996 |doi=10.1136/jech.2006.053157}}</ref> Some subsequent studies support the authors' findings, while others dispute them.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Snijder MB, van der Heijden AA, van Dam RM, ''et al.'' |title=Is higher dairy consumption associated with lower body weight and fewer metabolic disturbances? The Hoorn Study |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=989–95 |year=2007 |pmid=17413097 |doi=}}</ref>

== Therapy ==
The first line treatment is change of lifestyle (e.g., Dietary Guidelines for Americans and physical activity). However, if in three to six months of efforts at remedying risk factors prove insufficient, then drug treatment is frequently required. Generally, the individual disorders that compose the metabolic syndrome are treated separately. [[Diuretic]]s and [[ACE inhibitor]]s may be used to treat [[hypertension]]. Cholesterol drugs may be used to lower LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, if they are elevated, and to raise HDL levels if they are low. Use of drugs that decrease insulin resistance, e.g., [[metformin]] and [[thiazolidinedione]]s, is controversial; this treatment is not approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

A 2003 study indicated cardiovascular exercise was therapeutic in approximately 31% of cases. The most probable benefit was to triglyceride levels, with 43% showing improvement; but fasting plasma glucose and insulin resistance of 91% of test subjects did not improve.<ref name="katzmaryk" />
Many other studies have supported the value of increased physical activity and restricted caloric intake (exercise and diet) to treat metabolic syndrome.

Restricting the overall dietary carbohydrate intake is more effective in reducing the most common symptoms of metabolic syndrome than the more commonly prescribed reduction in dietary fat intake.<ref name="n&m2005">{{cite journal |author=Volek JS, Feinman RD |title=Carbohydrate restriction improves the features of Metabolic Syndrome. Metabolic Syndrome may be defined by the response to carbohydrate restriction |journal=Nutr Metab (Lond) |volume=2 |issue= 1|pages=31 |year=2005 |pmid=16288655 |pmc=1323303 |doi=10.1186/1743-7075-2-31 |url=http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/2/1/31}}</ref>

==Controversy==
The clinical value of using "metabolic syndrome" as a diagnosis has recently come under fire.  It is asserted that different sets of conflicting and incomplete diagnostic criteria are in existence, and that when confounding factors such as obesity are accounted for, diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome has a negligible association with the risk of heart disease.<ref>{{cite journal
|title=Metabolic syndrome—what is the clinical usefulness?

|pages=1892&ndash;1893
|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60731-X
|issue=9628}}</ref>

These concerns have led the [[American Diabetes Association]] and the [[European Association for the Study of Diabetes]] to issue a joint statement identifying eight major concerns on the clinical utility of the metabolic syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal
|author=Kahn R, Buse J, Ferrannini E, Stern M

|pmid=16123508
|doi=10.2337/diacare.28.9.2289
|issue=9}}</ref>

It is not contested that cardiovascular risk factors tend to cluster together, but what is contested is the assertion that the metabolic syndrome is anything more than the sum of its constituent parts.
