The third '''USNS ''Mercy'' (T-AH-19)''' is the [[lead ship]] of [[Mercy class hospital ship|her class]] of [[hospital ship]]s in the [[United States Navy]].  Her sister ship is the [[USNS Comfort (T-AH-20)|USNS ''Comfort'' (T-AH-20)]].  She was named for the [[Mercy|virtue of compassion]]. In accordance with the [[Geneva Conventions]], USNS ''Mercy'' and her crew do not carry any offensive weapons, though defensive weapons are available.  Firing on the ''Mercy'' would be considered a [[war crime]].

''Mercy'' was built as an oil tanker, SS ''Worth'', by [[National Steel and Shipbuilding Company]], San Diego, in 1976. Starting in July 1984, she was renamed and converted to a hospital ship by the same company. [[ship naming and launching|Launched]] on 20 July 1985, USNS ''Mercy'' was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 8 November 1986.  She has a raised forecastle, a transom stern, a bulbous bow, an extended deckhouse with a forward bridge, and a [[helicopter]]-landing deck with a flight control facility.  The Mercy class hospital ships are the second largest ships in the U.S. Navy Fleet by length, surpassed only by the nuclear-powered [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class]] [[supercarrier]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/usnsmercy/CommandInfo/Pages/CommandFacilities.aspx |title=Patient Care |work=Command Facilities |publisher=USNS Mercy |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref>

Her primary mission is to provide rapid, flexible, and mobile acute medical and surgical services to support Marine Corps Air/Ground Task Forces deployed ashore, Army and Air Force units deployed ashore, and naval amphibious task forces and battle forces afloat.  Secondarily, she provides mobile surgical hospital service for use by appropriate US Government agencies in disaster or humanitarian relief or limited humanitarian care incident to these missions or peacetime military operations.<ref name="med.navy.mil">{{cite web |url=http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/usnsmercy/CommandInfo/Pages/mission.aspx |title=? |accessdate=31 August 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>

USNS ''Mercy'', homeported in San Diego, is normally in reduced operating status.  Her crew remains a part of the staff of Naval Medical Center San Diego until ordered to sea, at which time they have five days to fully activate the ship to an Echelon III Medical Treatment Facility.<ref name="med.navy.mil"/>  Like most "USNS" Ships, Mariners from the US Navy's [[Military Sealift Command]] are responsible for navigation, propulsion, and most deck duties on board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=124&type=HospitalShip |title=USNS Mercy (T-AH 19) Hospital Ship |work=Ship Inventory |publisher=Military Sealift command |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref>  However, the "Medical Treatment Facility", or hospital on the ship, is commanded by a Captain of the [[Medical Corps (United States Navy)|Navy's Medical Corps]].

Combined, she provided 108,000 patient services, rendered by members of the Department of Defense, Project Hope, and the [[U.S. Public Health Service|United States Public Health Service]].

===Pacific Partnership 2006===
USNS ''Mercy'' departed San Diego in 2006 as the inagural deployment of [[Pacific Partnership]], an ongoing Civic Assistance mission designed to "Prepare in Calm to Respond in Crisis".

===Pacific Partnership 2008===
USNS ''Mercy'', departed San Diego on 14 April 2008 for "[[Pacific Partnership]] 2008", a 4-month humanitarian and civic [[Military deployment|deployment]] in Southeast Asia and Oceania.

On 10 June, the humanitarian mission was temporarily suspended after one of its helicopters was shot at in the strife-torn southern Philippines area of [[Mindanao]].  Over the course of the deployment, ''Mercy'' would treat 91,000 patients, including performing 1,369 surgeries.

===Pacific Partnership 2010===
On 24 February 2010, the Commander of the US Pacific Fleet announced that ''Mercy'' will be the lead vessel of Pacific Partnership 2010, a continuation of the recurring humanitarian mission to Southeast Asia and Oceania.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpf.navy.mil/archived_news/February2010/Feb%2024%20Pacific%20Fleet%20Announces%20Pacific%20Partnership%202010.shtml |title=Commander of US Pacific Fleet Announces Pacific Partnership 2010 |publisher=United States Pacific fleet |accessdate=31 August 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>.

In an effort to further expand the scope of the mission of "Preparing in Calm to Respond in Crisis", many more man hours of Subject Matter Expert Exchange (SMEE) with host nations, Veterinary Care, and construction projects were performed compared to past ''Mercy'' deployments, building the capacity of host nations to respond to regional disasters in a coordinated manner.
