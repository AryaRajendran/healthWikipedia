'''Dame Valerie Beral''' [[Companion of the Order of Australia|AC]] [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|FRCOG]] (born 1946) is an [[Australia]]n-born [[United Kingdom|British]] [[epidemiologist]], [[academic]] and a preeminent specialist in [[breast cancer]] [[Epidemiology of cancer|epidemiology]]. She is Professor of Epidemiology,<ref>http://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/valerie-beral</ref> a Fellow of [[Green Templeton College, Oxford]] and has been the Head of the [[Cancer Epidemiology Unit]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Cancer Research UK]] since 1989.<ref name="lifescientific">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01qdw1k/The_Life_Scientific_Valerie_Beral/ |title=Jim Al-Khalili talks to breast cancer pioneer Valerie Beral about her Million Women study and why she thinks a so-called 'vaccine' should be developed to prevent breast cancer |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="microsoft">{{AcademicSearch|23412861}}</ref><ref name="googlescholar">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=valerie+beral</ref>

==Education and training==
Valerie Beral was born in [[Australia]] on 28 July 1946. She completed her [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] degree graduating with [[Honours_degree#Honours_Degrees_and_academic_distinctions|first-class honours]] from the [[University of Sydney]] in 1969.<ref>[http://archive.sciencewatch.com/interviews/valerie_beral-1.htm Science Watch, ''Valerie Beral hunts for the causative agent of [[Kaposi's Sarcoma]]''], Nov/Dec 1991</ref>

She then spent six months travelling the "[[hippie trail]]" through [[Asia]] of which she said "That taught me how much I wanted to work. But I still wanted to leave Australia."<ref name="BMJ"/> She then travelled to [[England]] where a friend working at the [[Hammersmith Hospital]] told of her of a job that she applied for and got.

==Career==
At [[Hammersmith Hospital]] Valerie Beral worked under Charles Fletcher, who recognised that she was suited to [[epidemiology]] and so propelled her towards the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]]. There she completed a combined course in Epidemiology & Statistics in 1971&ndash;1972 under the tutorship of [[Donald Reid (epidemiologist)|Donald Reid]]. Beral felt very comfortable with the move because she had never felt happy in clinical medicine. She says that "she had never been able to understand how her peers could be so certain about making decisions on incomplete evidence. Epidemiology has offered her not an escape from that uncertainty, but the opportunity to tackle it head on."<ref name="BMJ"/> She also became a member of the [[Royal College of Physicians]].

One of Beral's first interests as a professional epidemiologist was the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] because of work she had previously done in family planning. She felt that epidemiology would give her the tools to begin to answer the questions that people had asked her about safety of the pill. Although Beral has moved on to other projects, this is still one area in which the data have yet to provide support for her initial instinct that the contraceptive pill, like pregnancy, will eventually be shown to protect against breast cancer.<ref name="BMJ"/> Later work included the effects of radiation, breast cancer trials and screening, [[AIDS]], [[gene therapy]], [[Hiroshima]] survivors, [[Chernobyl]], food toxins, and much else. The [[British Medical Journal]] described her tally of jobs, publications, and committees as reading "like a checklist of the epidemiological causes célebres of the past three decades".<ref name="BMJ"/>

Beral completed her training in 1972 and began working for the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] for a number of years. From there she moved to direct the Cancer Research UK Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1989. Beral said of being offered the role: "One of the major deterrents when I was offered the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund|ICRF]] job in 1989 was the thought of being so much in the public eye. It's not my nature."<ref name="BMJ">{{cite doi|10.1136/bmj.321.7268.1042}}</ref>

Beral has served on various international committees for the [[World Health Organisation]] and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]. She also chairs the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]]'s Advisory Committee on Breast Cancer Screening.

===Million Women Study===
Beral was one of the leaders of the [[Million Women Study]]<ref name="milliwomen">{{cite pmid|12927427}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1136/bmj.39367.495995.AE}}</ref> which was opened in 1997, and has recruited more than 1.3 million UK women over 50 via the NHS breast screening centres. The study is investigating how a woman’s reproductive history can affect women's health, with a particular focus on the effects of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT).<ref>{{cite pmid|12354487}}</ref> It is the largest such study in the world with one in four of UK women in the target age group participating.<ref name="CRUK">[http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerandresearch/ourcurrentresearch/researchbygrantee/beral/ Cancer Research UK]</ref><ref name="milliwomen"/>

In August 2003 Professor Beral’s group published landmark results showing that taking HRT increases a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer with an estimated 20,000 UK women aged 50&ndash;64 having possibly developed the disease between 1993 and 2003 due to HRT use.<ref name="CRUK"/> The study also showed that risk increases the longer a woman uses HRT, but drops to the normal level within five years after stopping use.<ref name="CRUK"/>

==Honours and awards==
*[[Donald Reid Medal]] {{spaced ndash}} in 2006 Beral was recognised by the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] for her ground-breaking work in cancer epidemiology and women’s health, most notably through the Million Women study, as well as her earlier contributions to the School.
*Honorary Fellow, [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]], 2000.
*Honorary MD, [[University of Aberdeen]], 2005
*Honorary Fellow, Faculty of Public Health Medicine, University of Aberdeen, 2000.
*Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] {{spaced ndash}} for scientific contributions to epidemiology.
*[[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59282 |date=31 December 2009 |startpage=6 |supp=yes }}</ref>
*[[Companion of the Order of Australia]] in the 2010 Queen's Birthday Honours List "for eminent service to medicine and women's health through significant advances in cancer research and epidemiology, through seminal contributions to public health policy and as a mentor to young scientists." <ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1142597&search_type=quick&showInd=true Companion of the Order of Australia] (AC), ''Its an Honour'', 14 June 2010</ref>

==Personal life==
Beral's work is based in [[Oxford]] where she has a flat. She also spends time in her house in north [[London]], shared with her American partner, Paul Fine, who works at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. She has two sons, Stephen and Richard.<ref name="BMJ"/> She maintains close links with her native Australia but "could not imagine returning to live there". Aside from concerns that Australia would hold little for her partner, Beral has also joked that "The population's too small!" to satisfy her needs as an epidemiologist.<ref name="BMJ"/>
