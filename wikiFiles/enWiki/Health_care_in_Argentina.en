[[Argentina]]'s [[health care systems|health care system]] is composed of three sectors: the [[public sector]], financed through [[tax]]es; the [[private sector]], financed through voluntary [[health insurance|insurance schemes]]; and the [[social security]] sector, financed through obligatory insurance schemes.  The Ministry of Health (MSAL), oversees all three subsectors of the health care system and is responsible for setting of regulation, evaluation and collecting statistics.

== Spending ==
In 1997, Argentina spent 8% of its GDP on health care expenditures.<ref>http://www.who.int/health_financing/documents/argentina_cavagnero.pdf</ref> A 2011 comparative report found that the average doctor's visit in Argentina cost about USD$9.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Comparative Price Report: Medical and Hospital Fees by Country|url=http://www.ifhp.com/documents/2011iFHPPriceReportGraphs_version3.pdf|publisher=International Federation of Health Plans|accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref>

===Obras Sociales===
The public sector is funded and managed by Obras Sociales, umbrella organizations for Argentine worker's unions.  There are over 300 Obras Sociales in Argentina, each chapter being organized according to the occupation of the beneficiary. These organizations vary greatly in quality and effectiveness. The top 30 chapters hold 73% of the beneficiaries and 75% of resources Health Care in Latin America.<ref>http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_ThtshshOPIC.html.</ref>   MSAS has established a Solidarity Redistribution Fund (FSR) to try to address these beneficiary inequities.  Only workers employed in the formal sector are covered under Obras Sociales insurance schemes and after [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|Argentina’s economic crisis of 2001]], the number of those covered under these schemes fell slightly (as unemployment increased and employment in the [[informal sector]] rose).  In 1999, there were 8.9 million beneficiaries covered by Obras Sociales.<ref name="Barrientos">Armando Barrientos "Reforming Health Insurance in Argentina and Chile" ''Health Policy and Planning'' 15(4): 420</ref>

===Private sector===
The private health care sector in Argentina is characterized by great heterogeneity and is made up of a great number of fragmented facilities and small networks; it consists of over 200 organizations and covers approximately 2 million Argentines.<ref name ="idrc">IDRC ''Reshaping Health Care in Latin America''http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/IDRCBookDetails.aspx?PublicationID=265.</ref>  Private insurance often overlaps with other forms of health care coverage, thus it is difficult to estimate the degree to which beneficiaries are dependent on the public and private sectors.  According to a 2000 report by the IRBC, foreign [[Competition (economics)|competition]] has increased in Argentina’s private sector, with [[Switzerland|Swiss]], American and other [[Latin America]]n [[health care provider]]s entering the [[market]] in recent years.  This has been accompanied by little formal regulation.<ref name ="idrc"/>

===Public system===
The public system is highly decentralized to the provincial level; often [[primary care]] is even under the purview of local townships.  Since 2001, the number of Argentines relying on public services has seen an increase.  According to 2000 figures, 37.4% of Argentines had no health insurance, 48.8% were covered under Obras Sociales, 8.6% had private insurance, and 3.8% were covered by both Obras Sociales and private insurance schemes.<ref name="Barrientos"/>
