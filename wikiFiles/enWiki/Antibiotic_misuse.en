'''Antibiotic misuse''', sometimes called '''antibiotic abuse''' or '''antibiotic overuse''', refers to the misuse or overuse of [[antibiotic]]s, with potentially serious effects on health. It is a contributing factor to the creation of [[Antibiotic resistance|multidrug-resistant bacteria]], informally called "super bugs": relatively harmless bacteria can develop resistance to multiple antibiotics and cause life-threatening infections.<ref name="pmid9643260">{{cite journal |author=Harrison JW, Svec TA |title=The beginning of the end of the antibiotic era?

==Epidemiology==
A 2003 study concerning the proper use of antibiotics in the emergency room revealed that 99% of instances contained some sort of error. Out of the 100 patients studied, 81 inappropriately received a prescription for [[fluoroquinolone]]. Out of these cases, 43 did not call for fluoroquinolone as a first-line agent, 27 presented no evidence of bacterial infection (based on documented evaluations), and 11 had questionable need for such therapy. Of the 19 cases that both called for and received fluoroquinolone, only one received both the correct dose and duration of therapy.<ref name="pmid12622607">{{cite journal |author=Lautenbach E, Larosa LA, Kasbekar N, Peng HP, Maniglia RJ, Fishman NO |title=Fluoroquinolone utilization in the emergency departments of academic medical centers: prevalence of, and risk factors for, inappropriate use |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=163 |issue=5 |pages=601–5 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12622607 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12622607 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.5.601}}</ref>

In a 1994 study of fluoroquinolone issued in a long-term care setting, 75% of the examined prescriptions were judged to be inappropriate. More than 50% did not call for fluoroquinolone as the first-line agent.<ref name="Pickering-1994">{{cite journal |author=Pickering TD, Gurwitz JH, Zaleznik D, Noonan JP, Avorn J |title=The appropriateness of oral fluoroquinolone-prescribing in the long-term care setting |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=28–32 |year=1994 |month=January |pmid=8277111}}</ref>

==Social and economic impact==
Antibiotics can cause severe reactions, increasing hospitalization: in the United States, this accounts for billions of dollars of expense within the healthcare system. Adverse effects from antibiotics account for nearly 25% of all adverse drug reactions amongst hospitalized patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beringer PM, Wong-Beringer A, Rho JP |title=Economic aspects of antibacterial adverse effects |journal=PharmacoEconomics |volume=13 |issue=1 Pt 1 |pages=35–49 |year=1998 |month=January |pmid=10175984 |doi=10.2165/00019053-199813010-00004}}</ref> Negative reactions to fluoroquinolones are easily misdiagnosed as a seizure disorder, [[Central nervous system|CNS]] problems, or psychiatric problems. <ref>{{cite journal |author=James R.

==Antibiotic resistance==
{{main|Antibiotic resistance}}
Though antibiotics are required to treat severe bacterial infections, misuse has contributed to a rise in bacterial resistance. The overuse of fluoroquinolone and other antibiotics fuels antibiotic resistance in bacteria, which can inhibit the treatment antibiotic-resistant infections.<ref name="Neuhauser-2003">{{cite journal |author=Neuhauser MM, Weinstein RA, Rydman R, Danziger LH, Karam G, Quinn JP |title=Antibiotic resistance among gram-negative bacilli in US intensive care units: implications for fluoroquinolone use |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=7 |pages=885–8 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12588273 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12588273 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.7.885}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Studies examine prescribing of antibiotics for respiratory infections in hospital emergency departments |url=http://www.ahrq.gov/research/nov07/1107RA29.htm |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |location=USA |quote = From 1995 to 2002, inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections, which are usually caused by viruses and thus are not responsive to antibiotics, declined from 61% to 49%.

==Inappropriate use==
Antibiotics have no effect on viral infections such as the common cold. They are also ineffective against sore throats, which are usually viral and self-resolving.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Little P, Gould C, Williamson I, Warner G, Gantley M, Kinmonth AL |title=Reattendance and complications in a randomised trial of prescribing strategies for sore throat: the medicalising effect of prescribing antibiotics |journal=BMJ |volume=315 |issue=7104 |pages=350–2 |year=1997 |month=August |pmid=9270458 |pmc=2127265 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9270458 |doi=10.1136/bmj.315.7104.350}}</ref> Most cases of bronchitis (90&ndash;95%) are viral as well, passing after a few weeks&mdash;the use of antibiotics such as [[ofloxacin]] against bronchitis is superfluous and can put the patient at risk of suffering adverse reactions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hueston WJ |title=Antibiotics: neither cost effective nor 'cough' effective |journal=The Journal of Family Practice |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=261–5 |year=1997 |month=March |pmid=9071245}}</ref>

===Antibiotics in livestock===
There has been massive use of antibiotics in [[animal husbandry]]. The most abundant use of antimicrobials worldwide are in livestock; they are typically distributed in animal feed or water for purposes such as disease prevention and growth.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Silbergeld |first1= E.K. |last2=Graham |first2=J. |last3=Price |first3=L.B. |title=Industrial food animal production, antimicrobial resistance, and human health |journal=Annual review of public health |volume=29 |pages=151-169 |year=2008 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090904}}</ref>
Debates have arisen surrounding the extent of the impact of these antibiotics, particularly antimicrobial growth promoters, on human antibiotic resistance. Although some sources believe that there remains a lack of knowledge on which antibiotic use generates the most risk to humans,<ref>{{Citation |last1=Landers |first1=T.F. |last2=Cohen |first2=B. |last3=Wittum |first3=T.E. |last4=Larson |first4=E.L. |title=A review of antibiotic use in food animals: Perspective, policy, and potential |journal=Public health reports |volume=127 |issue=1 |pages=4-22 |year=2012 |doi=10.1093/jac/dkg483}}</ref> policies and regulations have been placed to limit any harmful effects.

In the United States the danger of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to wide use of antibiotics to promote weight gain in livestock was determined by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] in 1977, but nothing effective was done to prevent the practice. In March, 2012 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruling in an action brought by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and others, ordered the FDA to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock which violated FDA regulations.<ref name=MPFDA>{{cite news|title=FDA Told to Move on Antibiotic Use in Livestock|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/31792|accessdate=March 24, 2012|newspaper=MedPage Today|date=March 23, 2012|author=John Gever}}</ref> On April 11, 2012 the FDA announced a program to phase out unsupervised use of drugs as feed additives and, on a voluntary basis, convert approved uses for antibiotics to therapeutic use only, requiring veterinarian supervision of their use and a prescription.<ref name=NYTPrescription>{{cite news|title=U.S. Tightens Rules on Antibiotics Use for Livestock|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/us/antibiotics-for-livestock-will-require-prescription-fda-says.html|accessdate=April 12, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 11, 2012|author=Gardiner Harris}}</ref><ref name=FDAFAQ>{{cite web|title=FDA's Strategy on Antimicrobial Resistance - Questions and Answers|url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/ucm216939.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=April 12, 2012|date=April 11, 2012|quote=“Judicious use” is using an antimicrobial drug appropriately and only when necessary; Based on a thorough review of the available scientific information, FDA recommends that use of medically important antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals be limited to situations where the use of these drugs is necessary for ensuring animal health, and their use includes veterinary oversight or consultation.
