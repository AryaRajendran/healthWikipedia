'''Nasal irrigation''' or '''nasal lavage''' or '''nasal douche''' is the personal [[hygiene]] practice in which the [[nasal cavity]] is washed to flush out excess [[mucus]] and debris from the [[Human nose|nose]] and [[sinuses]]. Nasal cleansing began as an [[Ayurveda|ayurvedic medicine]] technique in ancient India. The practice is generally well-tolerated and beneficial with only minor side effects.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/14651858.CD006394.pub2}}</ref> Nasal irrigation in a wider sense can also refer to the use of [[Saline spray|saline nasal spray]] or [[nebulizer]]s to moisten the [[mucous membrane]]s.

According to its advocates, nasal irrigation promotes good sinus and nasal health. Patients with chronic sinusitis including symptoms of facial pain, headache, [[halitosis]], cough, anterior [[rhinorrhea]] (watery discharge) and nasal congestion often find nasal irrigation to provide effective relief. In published studies, "daily hypertonic saline nasal irrigation improves sinus-related quality of life, decreases symptoms, and decreases medication use in patients with frequent sinusitis",<ref>{{cite pmid|12540331}}</ref> and irrigation is recommended as an adjunctive treatment for chronic sinonasal symptoms.<ref>{{cite pmid|16025044}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|10892694}}</ref>

Nasal irrigation is used to treat a wide range of chronic sinus and nasal symptoms; for chronic [[rhinosinusitis]] it is an effective adjunctive therapy. It is also an effective measure against chronic sinus symptoms induced by work-place exposure to sawdust.<ref name=USP>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.uspharmacist.com/continuing_education/ceviewtest/lessonid/105757/|title=The Use of Saline Nasal Irrigation in Common Upper Respiratory Conditions|author=Rabago, David|journal= [[U.S. Pharmacist]] |date= 1 June 2008}}</ref> Further evidence suggests that nasal irrigation causes relief for both hay-fever and the common cold.

Flushing the nasal cavity with salt water has been claimed to promote [[Mucociliary Clearance|mucociliary clearance]] by moisturizing the nasal cavity and by removing encrusted material, although there is no clear evidence to support this.<ref name=gob/> In proper proportion, nasal salt water solution with slight acidic pH functions as an anti-bacterial irrigant. The flow of salt water through the nasal passage flushes the dirt, airborne allergens (dust and pollen), pollutants and bacteria-filled mucus.

Salt water flushing also loosens and thins the mucus, making it easier to expel. Without this build-up of mucus, the tiny cilia, or hairs in the nasal passage are able to function more efficiently, pushing excess mucus either to the back of the throat or to the nose to be expelled.

Potential allergens (such as iodine) or contaminants (algae, etc.) are to be avoided in the sodium chloride, water, or buffering ingredients.<ref>{{cite pmid|17636843}}</ref> Premanufactured dosages of salt water flushing solutions can be purchased, or the user can mix non-iodized [[Kosher salt|'kosher' salt]], with or without a buffering agent such as sodium bicarbonate or baking soda (table salt frequently is iodized, while sea salt may contain algae or other contaminants). Treatment guidelines in both Canada and the United States now advocate use of nasal irrigation for all causes of rhinosinusitis and for postoperative cleaning of the nasal cavity.<ref>{{cite pmid|9927958}}</ref>

A conference abstract presented in 2009 indicated that long-term nasal irrigation led to higher rates of sinus infections, which the principal researcher theorized was due to alterations in nasal immunological chemistry brought on by flushing out the protective elements of the mucous membrane of the nose.<ref>Staff (November 2009).

==Nasal irrigation warning==
While nasal irrigation is generally well tolerated, at least two deaths from ''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'' have been reported from use of a neti pot.  ''Naegleria fowleri'' present in unboiled or otherwise unsterilized water causes the fatal brain infection [[primary amoebic meningoencephalitis|primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM)]].<ref>{{cite web

The probability of death from this ''Naegleria'' infection is as high as 98%, but the parasite can be killed by boiling water before use. According to Louisiana State Epidemiologist Raoult Ratard, "if you are irrigating, flushing, or rinsing your sinuses, for example, by using a neti pot, use distilled, sterile or previously boiled water to make up the irrigation solution."<ref name="Associated Press"/>

==Methods==
[[File:Neti pot.jpg|thumb|Ceramic neti pot]]
A simple method requiring no specialized equipment is to snort water from cupped hands, but this clears little more than the nostrils. The application of commercially available [[Saline spray|saline nasal spray]] is another simple alternative, but it is relatively inefficient for washing away debris, although it may suffice for simple rehydration of mucous and tissues.<ref>{{cite pmid|18025315}}</ref><ref name=Olson2002>{{cite pmid|12172251}}</ref>

A simple yet effective technique is to pour salt water solution into one nostril and let it run out through the other while the mouth is kept open to breathe, using gravity as an aid. ''Jala-neti'', which means to cleanse the nose with water,<ref>{{dead link|date=December 2012}} [http://neti-pot.info/neti-pot-history/].</ref> is an old yogic technique. The container used to administer the saline is called a "neti pot". [[Neti (Hatha Yoga)|Neti]] is [[Sanskrit]] for "nasal cleansing". A second neti technique known as ''sutra neti'' uses a piece of string instead of water.

Neti pots are typically made of metal, glass, ceramic or plastic. They rely on gravity, along with head positioning and repeated practice in order to rinse the outer sinus cavities. Typically they have a spout attached near the bottom, sometimes with a handle on the opposite side.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/neti-pot/AN01755 "What Is a Neti Pot? And Why Would You Use One?"].  [[Mayo Clinic]].</ref> Some users are able to use neti pots without problems, while the sideways positioning of the head can induce vertigo in others. A more advanced variation of the technique (known in yoga as ''Vyutkrama Kapalaneti'') involves pouring the same salt water solution into one nostril while the other is held closed, so that the solution runs out of the mouth. It is more challenging than the basic version (care must be taken to keep the saline solution out of the throat and to suppress possible vomiting reflex), but it can allow more thorough irrigation of the nasal cavity and the sinuses. The "Flip Turn Sinus Flush"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medhelp.org/user_journals/show/2322/The-Sinus-Flush|work=Friggy Flip Turn Sinus Flush}}</ref> offers a more thorough cleansing for those who wish to rinse the upper sinuses, which typically cannot be reached with the regular nasal flush. It involves leaning your head back before pouring in the saline solution, pinching your nostrils shut, leaning forward until the top of your head is facing the ground, standing straight up, and then blowing your nostrils. Another technique (known in yoga as ''Seethkrama Kapalaneti'') is to take the saline solution into the mouth and{{spaced ndash}} leaning forward{{spaced ndash}} force it out of the nostrils. This is not recommended for beginners. 

The second method of nasal irrigation is to introduce some form of positive pressure to the water introduced into the sinuses and nasal cavities in order to provide a more complete rinsing without resorting to special techniques, such as holding the head to one side (which is usually difficult only with a neck condition). Some products available from pharmacist supply retailers are essentially bottles made of flexible plastic with special tips to fit the nostril. These bottles, when filled with warm salt water solution, can be squeezed to exert positive pressure of the water flowing through the sinuses while the mouth is kept open at all times in order to breathe and prevent snorting the liquid down the throat. Even ordinary plastic water bottles can and have been used, as long as the nozzle will adequately fit a person's nostril. However, neither squeeze bottles nor [[syringe|bulb syringe]]s provide the user with any genuine control over the pressure/volume of solution introduced. To prevent ear pressure or ear infection, you need to make sure the pressure cannot be too high. The diameter of the hole in the center of the nostril fitting cannot be larger than 3&nbsp;mm. If it is too large, a big wave of liquid can be forced to enter anywhere, such as middle ear, causing ear pain or even ear infection.

Irrigation machines that utilize electric motor-driven pumps are also available. These irrigation devices pump salt water solution through a tube, in connection with a nasal adapter tip designed to seal against the nostril. Some of these machines allow adjustment of water volume/speed by use of an adjustment dial which regulates pump speed and volume per minute. Most of these motorized machines use a ''pulsatile'' or pulsating water pumping action at a relatively low, predetermined fixed pulse cyclic rate, designed to match the normal wave rate of healthy, unobstructed nasal cilia.<ref>Davidson, Terence M. (M.D.), ''Handbook of Nasal Disease, Part III, Nasal Irrigation'' http://drdavidson.ucsd.edu/portals/0/nasal.htm#NASAL_IRRIGATION</ref> This matched pulse rate is claimed to stimulate the nasal cilia hairs and promote better sinus health, while reducing the severity of allergic reactions.<ref>Davidson, Terence M. (M.D.), ''Handbook of Nasal Disease, Part III, Nasal Irrigation''</ref> More sophisticated motorized irrigators have two or more pulse cycle settings that adjust the actual pulse cycle (as opposed to a simple volume/speed control, which does not alter the pulse cyclic rate). This design affords the user the option of using a higher pulse cyclic rate when suffering from partially closed sinuses, as in a typical case of acute sinusitis. The efficacy of all motorized pump irrigators has not yet been tested compared to simpler non-motorized mechanical pressure nasal irrigation methods.<ref name=litreview>{{Cite journal|title=Clinical study and literature review of nasal irrigation|journal=Laryngoscope|volume=110|issue=7|pages=1189–93|year=2000|pmid=10892694|author=Tomooka LT, Murphy C, Davidson TM|doi=10.1097/00005537-200007000-00023}}</ref>

Some nasal irrigation systems that apply pressure have an anti-backwash valve to prevent used saltwater solution from flowing back into the nasal cavity. This is particularly important for those people with bacterial or viral infections, such as the common cold or flu. This type of irrigator should be held upright, as in brushing one's teeth, because if the head is tilted sideways, liquid could enter the ear on the lower side and cause an ear infection. This refers to an irrigator that applies pressure, but not to the neti pot, which utilizes only gravity in its application. Neti pots do not allow used solution to flow back into the nasal cavity.

==Solutions used for nasal irrigation==
While nasal irrigation can be carried out using ordinary tap water, this is [[#Nasal_irrigation_warning|not safe]] and additionally can be uncomfortable because it irritates the mucous membranes. Therefore an [[Tonicity#Isotonicity|isotonic]] or [[hypertonic]] [[Saline (medicine)|salt water solution]] is normally used, i.e. water with enough salt to match the [[tonicity]] of the body cells and blood. For the same reason, lukewarm water is preferred over cold water, which in addition to irritating nasal membranes can also exaggerate the gag reflex during irrigation. Use of distilled, sterile or previously boiled and cooled water over ordinary tap water is advised. Tap water safe for drinking is not necessarily safe for nasal irrigation due to risk of rare but fatal brain infection. A small amount of [[sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] is sometimes employed as a [[buffering agent]] to adjust the [[pH]] of the irrigating solution to that of the body.

Many pharmacies stock pre-manufactured sachets of pharmaceutical grade salt and baking soda designed to be used with the volume of water their corresponding device uses. Sometimes manufactured solutions such as a [[lactated Ringer's solution]] is used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It is also simple to make a salt-baking soda mixture.<ref>[http://www.uwhealth.org/healthfacts/B_EXTRANET_HEALTH_INFORMATION-FlexMember-Show_Public_HFFY_1104449346475.html UWHealth]</ref>

Optional additives include [[xylitol]] which is claimed to draw water into the sinus regions and helps displace bacteria.<ref>{{cite pmid|15607668}}</ref> Xylitol is commonly used to prevent [[Otitis_media#Acute|acute otitis media]] in Europe and [[dental caries]] in the United States,<ref>{{cite pmid|20569667}}</ref> but research into xylitol use in the sinus cavities is lacking. Another nasal irrigation additive is aloe extract, which helps to prevent nasal dryness.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Sodium citrate and citric acid help not only to balance the pH, but also to improve the sense of smell.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As noted above, in December 2011, the Louisiana state health department reported two deaths from ''Naegleria fowleri'' in which the use of contaminated tap water for nasal irrigation was strongly implicated.<ref>[http://www.wafb.com/story/16202318/louisiana-woman-dies-of-rare-infection "Louisiana Woman Dies of Rare Infection"]. 6 December 2011. [[WAFB]].</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
The precise reasons for the efficacy of nasal irrigation are not well understood, although it is clear that the removal of mucus plays an important role.<ref name=gob/> Damage to the [[mucociliary clearance|mucociliary transport system]] is an important factor in the development of sinonasal diseases, leading to a stasis of mucus.<ref name=litreview/> The numerous proteins found in nasal mucus include [[inflammatory mediators]], [[defensin]]s and many whose function is not understood.<ref name=gob/>
Thus hypotheses include that nasal irrigation may decrease inflammation through the removal of mucus, that it may improve [[mucociliary clearance]], and that it may remove thickened mucus that cannot be handled by the [[cilium|cilia]].<ref name=gob/><ref name=litreview/>

In a study with eight healthy volunteers, solution was transported reliably to [[ethmoid sinus|ethmoid]] and [[maxillary sinus|maxillary]] sinuses when it was snorted or applied with a squeeze bottle; a [[nebulizer]] was significantly less effective. [[Sphenoid sinus|Sphenoid]] and [[frontal sinus|frontal]] sinuses were rarely reached, and not at all with the nebulizer.<ref name=Olson2002/>

==History==
The earliest record of nasal irrigation is found in the ancient Hindu practice of Ayurveda whose roots are traced to the [[Vedas]]. The simplest method of nasal irrigation, that is to sniff water from cupped hands and then blow it out, is also a step in the hygienic practices ([[Wudu]]) of Muslims. {{cn|date=January 2013}}
