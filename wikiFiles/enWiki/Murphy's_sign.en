In [[medicine]], '''Murphy's sign''' refers to a maneuver during a [[physical examination]] as part of the [[abdominal examination]] and a finding elicited in [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]].  It is useful for [[Differential diagnosis|differentiating]] [[abdominal pain|pain]] in the [[right upper quadrant (abdomen)|right upper quadrant]].  Typically, it is positive in [[cholecystitis]], but negative in [[choledocholithiasis]], [[pyelonephritis]]
and [[ascending cholangitis]].

==During physical examination==
Classically Murphy's sign is tested for during an [[abdominal examination]]; it is performed by asking the patient to breathe out and then gently placing the hand below the [[costal margin]] on the right side at the mid-[[clavicle|clavicular]] line (the approximate location of the [[gallbladder]]).  The patient is then instructed to inspire (breathe in).  Normally, during inspiration, the [[abdomen|abdominal]] contents are pushed downward as the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] moves down (and [[lung]]s expand).  If the patient stops breathing in (as the gallbladder is [[Pain|tender]] and, in moving downward, comes in contact with the examiner's fingers) and winces with a 'catch' in breath, the test is considered positive. In order for the test to be considered positive, the same maneuver must not elicit pain when performed on the left side.  [[Medical ultrasonography|Ultrasound imaging]] can be used to ensure the hand is properly positioned over the gallbladder

==Predictive value==
Murphy's sign has a high [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] and [[negative predictive value]]; however, the [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] is not high.<ref name="pmid8780468">{{cite journal |author=Singer AJ, McCracken G, Henry MC, Thode HC, Cabahug CJ |title=Correlation among clinical, laboratory, and hepatobiliary scanning findings in patients with suspected acute cholecystitis |journal=Ann Emerg Med |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=267–72 |year=1996 |month=September |pmid=8780468 |doi= 10.1016/S0196-0644(96)70024-0|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0196-0644(96)70024-0 |accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> In the elderly the sensitivity is markedly lower; a negative Murphy's sign in an elderly person is not useful for ruling out cholecystitis if other tests and the clinical history suggest the diagnosis.<ref name="pmid8632396">{{cite journal |author=Adedeji OA, McAdam WA |title=Murphy's sign, acute cholecystitis and elderly people |journal=J R Coll Surg Edinb |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=88–9 |year=1996 |month=April |pmid=8632396 |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==History==
The sign is named for American [[physician]] [[John Benjamin Murphy]] (1857–1916), a prominent Chicago surgeon from the 1880s through the early 1900s, who first described the hypersensitivity to deep palpation in the subcostal area when a patient with gallbladder disease takes a deep breath.
