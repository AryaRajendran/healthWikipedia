Most recently he has created a number of controversies associated with his position at the Medical College of Georgia. During the merger of the Medical College of Georgia and Augusta State University, the final name chosen was contrary to the result chosen by local residents. This resulted in a "Save the A" campaign the avoid the new "Georgia Regents University at Augusta" name.

Additionally, he is being investigated for the use of University resources for personal gain, specifically: (a) using University transportation during a niece's wedding; and (b) commissioning a three-car carport addition to the University-owned house using University funds without seeking approval. The $26,000 project is already 50% over budget and work has been halted until the required approval is obtained.
