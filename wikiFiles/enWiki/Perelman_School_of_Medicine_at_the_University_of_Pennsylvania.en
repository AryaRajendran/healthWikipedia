The '''Perelman School of Medicine,''' commonly known as '''Penn Med,''' is the [[medical school]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. It is located in the [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]] section of [[Philadelphia]]. Founded in 1765, Penn Med is the oldest [[List of medical schools in the United States|medical school in the United States]].<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=University of Pennsylvania|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9432|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> Today, the Perelman School of Medicine is a major center of biomedical research and education, and it is widely regarded as one of the country's top medical schools. Penn Med consistently ranks among the highest recipients of [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] research awards,<ref>{{cite web|title=NIH Awards by Location & Organization, Medical Schools Only|url=http://report.nih.gov/award/index.cfm?ot=MS&fy=2012&state=&ic=&fm=&orgid=|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref> and it currently holds the #4 spot on [[U.S. News & World Report|U.S. News & World Report's]] "Best Medical Schools: Research" list.<ref name=USNews />

The school's young founder, [[John Morgan (physician)|John Morgan]], earned an AB from the [[College of Philadelphia]] (now [[University of Pennsylvania]]) and a MD from the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]].<ref>http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1700s/morgan_john. html.</ref> In 1765, after spending five years training in Edinburgh and touring Europe, Dr. Morgan returned to Philadelphia and persuaded the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania to found the first medical school in America. Shortly thereafter, he delivered an address, "Upon the Insitution of Medical Schools in America" during which he expressed his desire for the new medical school to become a model institution:<ref name="Harpers289">{{cite news|last=Thorpe|first=Francis M.|title=The University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 October 2011|newspaper=Harper's Magazine|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/harpers1895/harpers1895.html|pages=289|format=Magazine|month=July|year=1985}}</ref>
{{quote|Perhaps this medical institution, the first of its kind in America, though small in its beginning, may receive a constant increase of strength, and annually exert new vigor. It may collect a number of young persons of more ordinary abilities, and so improve their knowledge as to spread its reputation to different parts. By sending these abroad duly qualified, or by exciting an emulation amongst men of parts and literature, it may give birth to other useful institutions of a similar nature, or occasional rise, by its example to numerous societies of different kinds, calculated to spread the light of knowledge through the whole American continent, wherever inhabited.}}
That autumn, students enrolled for "anatomical lectures" and a course on "the theory and practice of physick."  Modeling the School after the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]], the need for supplemental medical lectures with bedside teaching was emphasized, which was satisfied by practitioners at the [[Pennsylvania Hospital]].<ref>{{cite book | title=University of Pennsylvania: its history, traditions, buildings and memorials | publisher=International Printing Company | author=Nitzsche, George Erazmus | year=1918 | location=Philadelphia, PA | pages=13 | edition=7th | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CWYgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA13}}</ref>

The School of Medicine's faculty was nationally renowned: [[Benjamin Rush]] (medicine), [[Philip Syng Physick]] (surgery), Robert Hare (chemistry), and, around the 1850s, [[William Pepper]] (medicine) and [[Joseph Leidy]] (anatomy). In 1847, the group of physicians who organized the [[American Medical Association]] effectively gave recognition to the School's fame by naming the AMA's first president [[Nathaniel Chapman]], Professor of Medicine at the School.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Medical examiner, and record of medical science, Volume 9|year=1853|publisher=Lindsay & Blakiston|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=532–5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=khYCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA532&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false|editor=Frances Gurney Smith and John B. Biddle|accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>

===Name===
On May 10, 2011 university president [[Amy Gutmann]] announced that the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine will be officially renamed the Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in honor of a $225 million contribution made to the medical school by Raymond G. Perelman, 93, a Philadelphia based philanthropist and father of billionaire [[Ronald Perelman]]. This sets the record as the largest donation given in U.S. history to rename a medical school. Together with a $25 million contribution made in 2005 to create the Ruth and Raymond Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine, the Perelman family contribution to the medical school to date is approximately $250 million.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/education/11penn.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=penn%20medecine&st=cse New York Times: Perelmans Rename Penn Med]</ref><ref>[http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/raymond-and-ruth-perelman-donate-225-million-university-pennsylvania-s-school-medicine Raymond and Ruth Perelman Donate $225 Million to the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Medicine]</ref> Note that the short version of the name, Perelman School of Medicine, is also an official name of the school.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perelman School Renaming Information|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/perelmanrenaming/|accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref>

==Campus==
In the 1870s, the university closed its campus in [[Center City, Philadelphia]] and established a new location across the [[Schuylkill River]] in [[West Philadelphia]], just north of the [[Blockley Almshouse]]. As part of this move, the School of Medicine's faculty persuaded the University's trustees to build a teaching hospital on the new campus, the [[Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania]] (HUP).<ref>{{cite web|title=School of Medicine, A Brief History|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/schools/med.html|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref>  Today, its affiliated hospitals include the [[Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania]] (first teaching hospital in America), [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] (first hospital in America), and [[Penn Presbyterian Medical Center]] which comprise the [[University of Pennsylvania Health System]].

The administrative offices of the School of Medicine are primarily located within Stemmler Hall and the John Morgan Building. Most educational and research buildings of the school are located on the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania within a triangle bounded by Hamilton Walk, University Avenue, and Civic Center Blvd.

The Penn School of Nursing building and the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office are both located within the School of Medicine complex.

==Medical advancements==
[[File:Clinical Research Building of the Perelman School of Medicine.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Clinical Research Building (CRB)]]
During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the School of Medicine was one of the earliest to encourage the development of the emerging medical specialties: neurosurgery, ophthalmology, dermatology, and radiology.  Between 1910 and 1939, the chairman of the Department of Pharmacology, [[Alfred Newton Richards]], played a significant role in developing the University as an authority of medical science, helping the United States to catch up with European medicine and begin to make significant advances in biomedical science.

In the 1950s and early 1960s, Dr. Jonathon E. Rhoads of the Department of Surgery (which he would later go on to head for many years), mentored Dr. Stanley Dudrick who pioneered the successful use of [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN) for patients unable to tolerate nutrition through their GI tract.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/v48/n17/Rhoads.html | title=Death of Dr. Jonathan Rhoads, A Preeminent Penn Paragon | work=University of Pennsylvania Almanac | date=8 January 2002 | accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>

In the 1980s and 1990s, Dr. C. William Schwab, a trauma surgeon, led numerous advances in the concept of damage control surgery for severely injured trauma patients.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/surgery/faculty/cws-pub.html | title=C. William Schwab, M.D., F.A.C.S., F.R.C.S. Traumatology, Surgical Critical Care and Emergency Surgery | publisher=Penn Medicine}}</ref>

In the 1990s and 2000s, Dr. [[Paul Offit]], a professor of Pediatrics at the School of Medicine and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, lead the scientific advances behind the modern [[RotaTeq]] vaccine for infectious childhood diarrhea.

In 2006, Drs. Kaplan and Shore of the Department of Orthopedics discovered the causative mutation in [[fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva]], an extremely rare disease of bone.<ref>{{cite journal | title=A recurrent mutation in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 causes inherited and sporadic fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. | author=Shore, EM | journal=Nature Genetics | year=2006 | month=May | volume=38 | issue=5 | pages=525–7 | doi=10.1038/ng1783 | pmid=16642017}}</ref>

==Medical curriculum==
[[File:Perelman School of Medicine Seal.gif|right|200px]]
Benchmark changes in the understanding of medical science and the practice of medicine have necessitated that the school change its methods of teaching, as well as its curriculum. Large changes were made in 1968, 1970, 1981, 1987, and 1997. The last significant change in 1997 brought about the institution of Curriculum 2000, "an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum which emphasizes [[small group learning|small group instruction]], self directed learning and flexibility." Three themes, ''Science of Medicine'', ''Art and Practice of Medicine'', and ''Professionalism and Humanism'', were developed by [[focus group]]s consisting of department chairpersons, course directors, and students.<ref>http://www.med.upenn.edu/history.html</ref>

The [[Doctor of Medicine|Doctor of Medicine (MD)]] curriculum is broken into six modules, each of which has its own courses:<ref name=curriculum>{{cite web|title=The Curriculum Overview and Outcomes|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/admiss/curriculum.html|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> 
# Core Principles
# Integrative Systems and Disease
# Technology and Practice of Medicine
# Required [[Clinical clerkship|Clinical Clerkships]]
# Electives, Selectives, and Scholarly Pursuit
# Professionalism and [[Humanism]]

The MD program is a four-year program that can be described in relation to traditional [[semesters]], with the modules for that semester and the courses taken for each. The first three semesters use about half the time for lectures and the other half for [[small group learning]] and [[problem-based learning]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Percentage Lecture vs. Small Groups|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/admiss/curriculum7.html|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}</ref> 

* Semester 1
** Module 1: basic sciences, basic medical sciences, and [[gross anatomy]]
** Module 3: [[doctor-patient relationship]], communication skills, and a longitudinal patient experience
** Module 6: [[Cultural competence|cultural competencies]]
* Semesters 2, 3
** Module 2: organ systems-based courses
** Module 3: clinical decision making, health care systems, introduction to clinical medicine, longitudinal patient experience, [[differential diagnosis]], and [[medical simulation]]s
** Module 6: [[research ethics]], doctoring, and communication
* Semesters 4, 5
** Module 4: required [[clinical clerkships]]
** Module 6: doctoring, communication, and patient safety
* Semesters 6, 7, 8
** Module 5: electives, selectives, "frontiers in medicine," (during which updates to medical science are discussed) and the required scholarly pursuit
** Module 6: communication, and [[bioethics]]

In addition to the MD curriculum, the school offers certificate programs in global health, women's health, community health, clinical neuroscience, and aging. There is also a combined degree option with the MD degree in combination with [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.), [[Juris Doctor]] (JD), [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA), Master of [[Bioethics]] (MBE), Master of Science in [[Clinical Epidemiology]] (MSCE), Master of Science in [[Translational Research]] (MTR), Master of [[Public Health]] (MPH), and Master of Science in [[Health Policy]] Research (MSHP).<ref name=combined>{{cite web|title=Combined Degree and Physician Scholars Program|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/educ_combdeg/|accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> There also exists the option for an extra year to pursue various avenues, including research or finishing the requirements for a second degree.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curriculum Innovations|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/admiss/UPENNSchoolofMedicineAdmissionsOfficeCurriculumInnovations.html|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}</ref>

==Biomedical Graduate Studies==
[[File:Biomedical Research Building (BRB) of the Perelman School of Medicine.jpg|thumb|200px|Biomedical Research Building (BRB)]]
Biomedical Graduate Studies, contained within the Perelman School of Medicine, was established in 1985 and serves as the academic home within the University of Pennsylvania for roughly 700 students pursuing a PhD in the basic biomedical sciences. BGS consists of more than 600 faculty members across seven Penn schools and several associated institutes including [[Wistar Institute]], [[Fox Chase Cancer Center]], and [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]].<ref name=BSGAbout>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/bgs/about.shtml|work=Biomedical Graduate Studies|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> There are seven graduate programs, labeled by the school as "graduate groups," that lead to a [[Ph.D.]] in basic [[Medical research|biomedical sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|title=BGS Overview|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/bgs/faculty_overview.shtml|work=Biomedical Graduate Studies|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref>
