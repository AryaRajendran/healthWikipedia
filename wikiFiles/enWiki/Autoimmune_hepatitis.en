'''Autoimmune Hepatitis''' is a disease of the liver that occurs when the body's immune system attacks cells of the liver. Anomalous presentation of [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) class II on the surface of [[hepatocyte]]s,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} possibly due to [[gene]]tic predisposition or [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] [[liver]] [[infection]], causes a cell-mediated [[immune response]] against the body's own liver, resulting in autoimmune hepatitis. This abnormal immune response results in inflammation of the liver, which can lead to further symptoms and complications such as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[cirrhosis]].<ref name="urlDigestive Disease: Autoimmune Hepatitis">{{cite web |url=http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/autoimmunehep/ |title=Digestive Disease: Autoimmune Hepatitis |author=National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse |accessdate=October 9, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100915033205/http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/autoimmunehep/| archivedate= 15 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}},</ref>

Autoimmune hepatitis has an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 per year, and a prevalence of 10-20/100,000. As with most other [[autoimmune disease]]s, it affects women much more often than men (70%).<ref name="urlAutoimmune Hepatitis">{{cite web |url=http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/dept/gi/autoimmune.html |title=Autoimmune Hepatitis |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> [[Liver enzyme]]s are elevated, as may be [[bilirubin]].

==Presentation==

The patient is classically a young female. They may present with signs of chronic liver disease (cirrhosis, low albumin, spider nivae etc.) or acute hepatitis (25% present with fever, jaundice, painful hepatomegaly etc.). Commonly, the patient will have [[amenorrhoea]] - this may be the presenting complaint.

==Classification==
Four subtypes are recognised, but the clinical utility of distinguishing subtypes is limited.

==Diagnosis==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
The [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of autoimmune hepatitis is best achieved with a combination of [[clinical trial|clinical]], [[laboratory]] and histological findings.

A number of specific [[antibodies]] found in the blood ([[antinuclear antibody]] (ANA), [[anti-smooth muscle antibody]] (SMA), [[liver/kidney microsomal antibody]] (LKM-1, LKM-2, LKM-3), [[anti soluble liver antigen]] (SLA/LP) and [[anti-mitochondrial antibody]] (AMA)) are of use, as is finding an increased [[IgG|Immunoglobulin G]] level. However, the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis always requires a [[liver biopsy]].

Expert opinion has been summarized by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group, which has published criteria which utilize clinical and laboratory data that can be used to help determine if a patient has autoimmune hepatitis.<ref name="pmid10580593">{{cite journal |author=Alvarez F, Berg PA, Bianchi FB, ''et al.'' |title=International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group Report: review of criteria for diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis |journal=[[J. Hepatol.]] |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=929–38 |year=1999 |month=November |pmid=10580593 |doi= 10.1016/S0168-8278(99)80297-9|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168827899802979 |accessdate=2008-05-09}}</ref>
A calculator based on those criteria is available online.<ref name="urlAutoimmune Hepatitis Calculator">{{cite web |url=http://www.napervillegi.com/contrivances/aihcalc.html |title=Autoimmune Hepatitis Calculator |work= |accessdate=2008-05-09}}</ref>

Overlapping presentation with [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] and [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] has been observed.<ref name="pmid17486048">{{cite journal |author=Washington MK |title=Autoimmune liver disease: overlap and outliers |journal=[[Mod.

==Treatment==
Treatment may involve the prescription of immunosuppressive [[glucocorticoids]], with or without [[azathioprine]], and remission can be achieved in up to 60&ndash;80% of cases, although many will eventually experience a [[relapse]].<ref name="pmid8109584">{{cite journal |author=Krawitt EL |title=Autoimmune hepatitis: classification, heterogeneity, and treatment |journal=Am.
