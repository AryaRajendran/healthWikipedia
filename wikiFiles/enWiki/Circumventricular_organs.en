'''Circumventricular organs''' (CVOs) are structures in the brain that are characterized by their extensive vasculature and lack of a normal [[Blood-brain barrier|blood brain barrier]] (BBB).<ref name="Fry">Fry Mark, Ferguson Alastair V., (2007) The sensory circumventricular organs: Brain targets for circulating signals controlling ingestive behavior, Physiology &amp; Behavior, Volume 91, Issue 4, 24 July 2007, Pages 413-423, ISSN 0031-9384, 10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.04.003.

The '''sensory organs''' include the [[area postrema]] (AP), the [[subfornical organ]] (SFO) and the [[organum vasculosum of lamina terminalis]] (OVLT.) They have the ability to sense plasma molecules and then pass that information into other regions of the brain. Through this, they provide direct information to the [[Autonomic Nervous System|autonomic nervous system]] from systemic circulation.<ref name="Fry" /><ref name="Ferguson">Ferguson, A. V., & Bains, J. S. (1996). Electrophysiology of the circumventricular organs. Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology, 17(4), 440-475. doi: 10.1006/frne.1996.0012.</ref> The '''secretory organs''' include the [[subcommissural organ]] (SCO), the posterior pituitary (also known as the [[Posterior pituitary|neurohypophysis]]), the [[Pineal Gland|pineal gland]], the [[median eminence]] and the intermediate lobe of the pituitary.<ref name="Cottrell" />  These organs are responsible for secreting hormones and glycoproteins into the peripheral vascular system using feedback from both the brain environment and external stimuli.

All of the circumventricular organs, besides the SCO, contain extensive vasculature and fenestrated capillaries which leads to a ‘leaky’ BBB at the site of the organs. Furthermore, all CVOs contain neural tissue, allowing them to play a role in the neuroendocrine system. It is highly debated if the [[choroid plexus]] can be included as a CVO. It has a high concentration of fenestrated capillaries, but its lack of neural tissue and its primary role of producing [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) usually excludes the choroid plexus from the CVO classification.<ref name="Cottrell" />

Research has also linked CVOs to body fluid regulation, cardiovascular functions, immune responses, thirst, feeding behavior and reproductive behavior.<ref name="Cottrell" />

==Sensory organs==

===Area postrema===

====''Anatomy''====

The area postrema shows structural resemblance to the [[subfornical organ]] and is located on the surface of the [[medulla oblongata]] in the posterior part of the brain.<ref name="oblongata">Borison, H. L. "Area Postrema: Chemoreceptor Circumventricular Organ of the Medulla Oblongata." Area Postrema: Chemoreceptor Circumventricular Organ of the Medulla Oblongata 32.5 (1989): 351-90.

M., D. Mecchia, and L. Matturri. "Neuropathology of the Area Postrema in Sudden Intrauterine and Infant Death Syndromes Related to Tobacco Smoke Exposure." Autonomic Neuroscience - Basic and Clinical 166.1-2 (2012): 29-34. Web of Knowledge. Web. 4 Nov. 2012. <http://apps.webofknowledge.com.proxy.bc.edu/full_record.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&qid=3&SID=3BnNM8nLa@GDCe7jciJ&page=1&doc=1>.</ref> Its bilateral structure makes it lie on either side of the medullary midline, at the junction between the medulla and the [[spinal cord]].<ref name="infant" />

====''Function''====

There is little information known about this structure in humans.  However, it is known that the area postrema is the locus, or site, of the [[chemoreceptor]] trigger zone for vomiting.<ref name="oblongata" /> It functions as the fundamental physiological mechanism of the CNS for this reaction, which is triggered in the presence of noxious stimulation.<ref name="infant" /> The area postrema also has integrative capacities that enable it to send major and minor [[efferent]]s to sections of the brain involved in the autonomic control of cardiovascular and respiratory activities.<ref name="infant" />

===Organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT)===

====''Anatomy''====

Classified as a sensory circumventricular organ (along with the SFO and AP),<ref name="Morita" /> the OVLT is situated in the anterior wall of the third cerebral ventricle.<ref name="Ott">Ott, D., Murgott, J., Rafalzik, S., Wuchert, F., Schmalenbeck, B., Roth, J., and Gerstberger, R. (2010). Neurons and glial cells of the rat organum vasculosum laminae terminalis directly respond to lipopolysaccharide and pyrogenic cytokines. Brain Res. 1363, 93-106.</ref> It lacks the tight endothelial blood brain barrier characteristic of the CVOs.<ref name="Ott" /><ref name="Ciura">Ciura, Sorana, Liedtke, Wolfgang, Borque, Charles (2011). Hypertonicity Sensing in Organum Vasculosum Lamina Terminalis Neurons: A Mechanical Process Involving TRPV1 But Not TRPV4. The Journal of Neuroscience, 31(41): 14669-14676; doi: 10.1523/ JNEUROSCI.1420-11.2011.</ref> The OVLT is further characterized by the [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] inputs from the subfornical organ (SFO), the median pre-optic nucleus (MnPO) region, the brain stem, and even the hypothalamus.  Conversely, the organum vasculosum maintains efferent projections to the [[Stria medullaris of thalamus|stria medullaris]] and [[basal ganglia]].<ref name="Ferguson" />
	
As a major player in the maintenance of the mammalian body fluid homeostasis, the OVLT features the primary neurons responsible for osmosensory balance.<ref name="Ciura" /><ref name="Issa">Issa, A.T., Miyata, K., Heng, V., Mitchell, K.D., and Derbenev, A.V. (2012). Increased neuronal activity in the OVLT of Cyp1a1-Ren2 transgenic rats with inducible Ang II-dependent malignant hypertension. Neurosci. Lett. 519, 26-30.</ref>  These neurons, in turn, feature [[angiotensin]] type I receptors which are used by circulating angiotensin II to initiate water intake and sodium consumption.<ref name="Morita" /> In addition to the angiotensin receptors, the neurons of the OVLT are also characterized by the presence of a nonselective cation channel deemed the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, or [[TRPV1]].<ref name="Ciura" /><ref name="Issa" />  Though there are other receptors within the TRPV family, a study by Ciura, Liedtke, and Bourque demonstrated that hypertonicity sensing operated via a mechanical mechanism of TRPV1 but not [[TRPV4]].<ref name="Ciura" />  Despite a significant amount of data, the anatomy of the OVLT is not yet fully comprehended.

====''Function''====

As previously mentioned, the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis features neurons responsible for the homeostatic conservation of osmolarity.<ref name="Issa" /> In addition, the fenestrated vasculature of the OVLT allows the glial [[astrocyte]]s and neurons of the OVLT to perceive a wide variety of plasma molecules whose signals may be transduced into other regions of the brain, and therefore elicit autonomic and inflammatory reactions.<ref name="Morita" />

In experiments, mammalian OVLT neurons were shown to transduce hypertonicity by the activation of the TRPV1 nonselective cation channels.  These channels are highly permeable to calcium and are responsible for membrane depolarization and increased action potential discharge.<ref name="Ciura" /> Stated simply, an increase in osmolarity results in a reversible depolarization of the OVLT neurons.<ref name="Ferguson" />  This can be seen through the predominantly excitatory effects of ANG on the OVLT through the TRPV1 receptor.  In this context, it is worthy to note the OVLT neurons typically feature a resting membrane potential in the range of -50 to -67 mV with input resistances ranging from 65 to 360 MΩ.<ref name="Ferguson" />

Despite a solid understanding of the OVLT’s role in the maintenance of body fluid homeostasis, other functions are less understood.  For example, it is thought that the OVLT may also play a role in the regulation of [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] secretion via a [[negative feedback]] mechanism.<ref name="Ferguson" /> It is also hypothesized that the OVLT may be the mechanism through which pyrogens function to initiate a febrile response in the CNS.<ref name="Ferguson"/> Finally, OVLT neurons have been observed to respond to temperature changes indicating that the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis is subject to different climates.<ref name="Ferguson" />

===Subfornical organ (SFO)===

====''Anatomy''====

	The subfornical organ is a sensory CVO situated in the lamina terminalis and lacking the [[Blood-brain barrier|BBB]], the absence of which characterizes the circumventricular organs.  Protruding into the third ventricle of the brain, the highly vascularized SFO can be divided into three anatomical zones.<ref name="Ferguson" /> The central zone is comprised exclusively of the [[Neuroglia|glial cells]] and neuronal cell bodies.  Conversely, the rostral and caudal areas are mostly made of nerve fibers while very few neurons and glial cells can be seen in this area.<ref name="Ferguson" />  Functionally, however, the SFO may be viewed in two portions, the dorsolateral peripheral (pSFO) division and the ventromedial core segment.<ref name="Kawano">Kawano, H., and Masuko, S. (2010). Region-specific projections from the subfornical organ to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus in the rat. Neuroscience 169, 1227-1234.</ref>

	As an important mechanism of both energy and osmotic homeostasis, the SFO has many efferent projections.  In fact, SFO neurons have been experimentally shown to broadcast [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] projections to regions involved in cardiovascular regulation including the lateral hypothalamus with fibers terminating in the [[Supraoptic nucleus|supraoptic (SON)]] and [[Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus|paraventricular (PVN)]] nuclei, and the anteroventral 3rd ventricle (AV3V) with fibers terminating in the OVLT and the [[Preoptic area|median preoptic area]].<ref name="Ferguson" /><ref name="Medeiros">Medeiros, N., Dai, L., and Ferguson, A.V. (2012). Glucose-responsive neurons in the subfornical organ of the rat—a novel site for direct CNS monitoring of circulating glucose. Neuroscience 201, 157-165.</ref><ref name="Smith">Smith, P. M. and Ferguson, A. V. (2012), Cardiovascular Actions of Leptin in the Subfornical Organ are Abolished by Diet-Induced Obesity. Journal of Neuroendocrinology, 24: 504–510. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2826.2011.02257.x.</ref>  It seems that the most essential of all these connections is the SFO’s projections to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus.<ref name="Kawano" />  Based on their functional relevance, the SFO neurons can be branded as either GE, featuring nonselective cation channels, or GI, featuring potassium channels.<ref name="Medeiros" /> While the afferent projections of the SFO are considered less important than the various efferent connections, it is still notable that the subfornical organ receives synaptic input from the [[zona incerta]] and [[arcuate nucleus]].<ref name="Miyahara">Miyahara, N., Ono, K., Hitomi, S., Hirase, M., and Inenaga, K. (2012). [[Dopamine]] modulates neuronal excitability pre- and post-synaptically in the rat subfornical organ. Brain Res. 1447, 44-52.</ref>

	Study of subfornical organ anatomy is still ongoing but recent evidence has demonstrated the presence of [[endothelin]] (a potent vasoconstrictor) receptors.<ref name="Ferguson" />  This observation coincides with the fact that SFO neurons have been shown to be intrinsically osmosensitive.<ref name="Ferguson" />  Finally, it has been established that SFO neurons maintain [[Resting potential|resting membrane potential]] in the range of -57 to -65 mV.<ref name="Ferguson" />

====''Function''====

The subfornical organ is a circumventricular organ active in many bodily processes including, but not limited to, osmoregulation,<ref name="Kawano" /><ref name="Miyahara" /> cardiovascular regulation,<ref name="Kawano" /><ref name="Smith" /> and energy homeostasis.<ref name="Smith" />  In a study by Ferguson, both hyper- and hypotonic stimuli facilitated an osmotic response.<ref name="Ferguson" /> This observation demonstrated the fact that the SFO is involved in the maintenance of blood pressure.  Featuring an [[Angiotensin II receptor type 1|AT1]] receptor for ANG, the SFO neurons demonstrate an excitatory response when activated by [[Angiogenin|ANG]], therefore increasing [[Blood pressurer|blood pressure]].<ref name="Ferguson" />  The induction of the drinking response via the SFO can be antagonized, however, by the peptide, [[Atrial natriuretic peptide|ANP]].<ref name="Ferguson" /> Additional research has demonstrated that the subfornical organ may be an important intermediary though which leptin acts to maintain blood pressure within normal physiological limits via descending autonomic pathways associated with cardiovascular control.<ref name="Smith" />

	Recent study has focused on the subfornical organ as an area particularly important in the regulation of energy.  The observation that subfornical neurons are perceptive of a wide range of circulating energy balance signals, and that electrical stimulation of the SFO in rats resulted in food intake supports the SFO’s importance in energy homeostasis.<ref name="Medeiros" /> Additionally, it is assumed that the SFO is the lone forebrain structure capable of constant monitoring of circulating concentrations of glucose.<ref name="Medeiros" /> This responsiveness to glucose again serves to solidify the SFO’s integral role as a regulator of energy homeostasis.<ref name="Medeiros" />

==Secretory organs==

===Subcommissural organ===

====''Anatomy''====

The '''subcommissural organ''' (SCO) is a small secretory organ located near the anterior entrance of the [[Cerebral aqueduct|sylvian aqueduct]] and at the midline roof of the third ventricle.<ref name="Congenital">Lee, Kristie, Jacqueline Tan, Michael B. Morris, Karine Rizzoti, James Hughes, Pike See Cheah, Fernando Felquer, Xuan Liu, Sandra Piltz, Robin Lovell-Badge, and Paul Q. Thomas. "Congenital Hydrocephalus and Abnormal Subcommissural Organ Development in Sox3 Transgenic Mice." Www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. N.p., 26 Jan. 2012. Web. 14 Sept. 2012. <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.proxy.bc.edu/pmc/articles/PMC3266892/>.</ref> The SCO also covers and penetrates the posterior commissure. It is aberrant from  other CVOs in that lacks a  high concentration of fenestrated capillaries, making its BBB less permeable. On the other hand, its large role in the neuroendocrine system awards it the CVO classification.<ref name="Cottrell" /> Related to its secretory function, the SCO is partially composed of ependymal cells. These ependymocytes are characterized by an elongated cell body covered in cilia, which contains secretory materials. The most prominent of these is the glycoprotein [[SSPO|SCO-spondin]].<ref name="Congenital" /><ref name="Calcitonin">Saha, S., & Subhedar, N. (2011). Calcitonin-like immunoreactivity in the subcommissural organ–Reissner's fiber complex of some freshwater and marine teleosts. Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy, 41(2), 122-128. doi: 10.1016/j.jchemneu.2010.12.004.</ref>

====''Function''====

The main function of the SCO is the secretion of the glycoprotein SCO-spondin. When SCO-spondin is released, it travels into the third ventricle, where it aggregates to create Reissner’s fibers (RF).<ref name="Water">Elgot, A., Ahboucha, S., Bouyatas, M. M., Fèvre-Montange, M., & Gamrani, H. (2009). Water deprivation affects the serotoninergic system and glycoprotein secretion in the sub-commissural organ of a desert rodent meriones shawi. Neuroscience Letters, 466(1), 6-10. doi: 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.08.058</ref> Reissner's fibers are long fibrous projections that travel caudally through the sylvian aqueduct and can terminate as far as the spinal cord. These fibers contribute to the maintenance of the patency of the sylvian aqueduct. If the SCO were to malfunction, causing a loss of the Reissner's fibers, a medical condition known as [[Hydrocephalus|Congenital Hydrocephalus]] (CH) can develop. CH is an ailment characterized by a large and abnormal accumulation of cerbrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain and is usually caused by genetic mutations.<ref name="Congenital" /> 

While the function of the subcommissural organ is still under investigation, it has been hypothesized that it is also part of the mechanism of aldosterone secretion and CSF detoxification, along with osmoregulation.<ref name="Water" /> The SCO is innervated by many systems, the most common of which is associated with the serotonergic system. The serotonergic system influences water and sodium intake. During water deprivation it will also reduce its innervation to the SCO. The reduction of input to the SCO causes a marked decrease in RF production. This finding implies that the subcommissural organ and its associated Reissner's fibers are an integral part of fluid electrolyte balance and water homeostasis.<ref name="Water" />

===Posterior pituitary===

====''Anatomy''====

The pituitary is subdivided into two principal lobes, anterior and posterior, and is also known as the neurohypophysis.<ref name="book">Marieb, Elaine N. Human Anatomy and Physiology. 6th ed. N.p.: Benjamin Cummings, 2003. Print.</ref> Each one functions as a separate [[Endocrine system|endocrine organ.]] The posterior pituitary is made up by a stalk, the infundibulum, which consists of axonal projections that extend from the [[hypothalamus]].<ref name="book" /> It is located in the [[sella turcica]] of the [[sphenoid bone]] at the base of the skull.<ref name="wob">Amar, A. P., and M. H. Weiss. "Pituitary Anatomy and Physiology." Neurosurgery Clinics of North America 14.1 (2003): n. pag. Web of Knowledge. Web. 4 Nov. 2012.<http://apps.webofknowledge.com.proxy.bc.edu/full_record.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&qid=2&SID=3BnNM8nLa@GDCe7jciJ&page=1&doc=1>.</ref>

====''Function''====

The posterior pituitary is deemed the “master gland” because it has a crucial role in maintaining [[homeostasis]], regulating the [[Reproduction|reproductive cycle]] and guiding the activity of other glands.<ref name="wob" /> The posterior lobe stores and releases [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]], also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which are produced in the hypothalamus.<ref name="book" />

===Median eminence===

The '''median eminence''' (ME) is located in the inferior portion of the [[hypothalamus]] and is ventral to the third ventricle. While some publications do not list the ME as a CVO, when it is considered to be a circumventricular organ, it is classified as a secretory organ. The median eminence is rich in fenestrated capillaries, allowing for the passage of proteins and neurohormones. More specifically, the median eminence allows for the transport of neurohormones between the CSF and the peripheral blood supply.<ref name="Differential">Mullier, A., Bouret, S. G., Prevot, V. and Dehouck, B. (2010), Differential distribution of tight junction proteins suggests a role for tanycytes in blood-hypothalamus barrier regulation in the adult mouse brain. J. Comp. Neurol., 518: 943–962. doi: 10.1002/cne.22273.</ref> The major cell type that makes up the median eminence are specialized ependymal cells known as '''tanycytes'''. These contribute to the organ's ability to selectively allow macromolecules to pass from the central to the peripheral neuroendocrine systems.<ref name="Design" /><ref name="Differential" /> 

'''Tanycytes''' line the floor of the third ventricle and can be characterized by a singular long projection that delves deep inside the hypothalamus. Tanycytes have been evolutionarily linked to radial glial cells of the central nervous system. The tanycytes of the median eminence are often found along the fenestrated peripheral capillaries. They are tightly packed on the capillaries, forming a seal between the third ventricle and the median eminence. This seal can be attributed to the tight junctions observed between tanycytes and functions to restrict the travel of molecules between the median eminence and the third ventricle.<ref name="Design" /> The median eminence is also closely linked to the transport of [[GnRH]] between the median eminence and the anterior pituitary. Neuronal projections of GnRH neurons actually end at the median eminence, allowing for its release into the portal blood system.<ref name="3D">Yin, W., Mendenhall, J. M., Monita, M. and Gore, A. C. (2009), Three-dimensional properties of GnRH neuroterminals in the median eminence of young and old rats. J. Comp. Neurol., 517: 284–295. doi: 10.1002/cne.22156.</ref><ref name="Ultrastructural">Uenoyama, Y., Inoue, N., Pheng, V., Homma, T., Takase, K., Yamada, S., Ajiki, K., Ichikawa, M., Okamura, H., Maeda, K.-I. and Tsukamura, H.

===Pineal gland===

====''Anatomy''====

=====Gross Anatomy=====
The morphology of the pineal gland varies greatly among mammals. The most commonly used classification for this gland takes into account its location relative to the [[diencephalon]] and the [[third ventricle]] of the brain, as well as its size and shape.<ref name="sd">Bruce, J. N. "Human Pineal Physiology and Functional Significance of Melatonin." Human Pineal Physiology and Functional Significance of Melatonin 25.3-4 (2004): 177-95. Web of Knowledge. Web. 4 Nov. 2012. <http://www.sciencedirect.com.proxy.bc.edu/science/article/pii/S0091302204000196#>.</ref> Under these conditions, the human pineal gland is classified as type A.<ref name="sd" /> A type A pineal gland rests proximally to the posterior section of the diencephalon. It is located within 1-2mm of the midline of the brain.<ref name="sd" />
The pineal gland starts to develop during the second month of gestation. In the average adult, the dimensions are as follow: 5-9mm in length, 1-5mm in width and 3-5mm in thickness. Its average weight is 100–180&nbsp;mg.<ref name="sd" />
	The pineal gland consists of a central core made up of small lobes and a cortex that possesses a diffuse distribution of [[neuron]]s. The principal cell type of the pineal is the pinealocyte sensu stricto. This type of cell has a prominent nucleus and a granular appearance.<ref name="sd" />

=====Vascularization and Innervation=====
	The level of vascularization in the pineal gland is high. It receives a large supply of blood from branches of the posterior choroidal arteries that derive from [[Posterior cerebral artery|cerebral arteries]] in the posterior [[Midbrain|mesencephalon]].<ref name="sd" />
	The pineal gland is innervated by fibers from the peripheral [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] and [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic systems]], in addition to fibers from the central nervous system (CNS).<ref name="nature">Wurtman, R. J., and J. Axelrod. The Pineal Gland. 1965. Article.>.</ref> However, the brain itself doesn’t supply it with much innervation. The most important set of fibers involved are the [[Myelin|unmyelinated]] [[Postganglionic nerve fibers|postganglionic sympathetic fibers]] from the [[Superior cervical ganglion|superior cervical ganglia]] (SCG), which also form the bilateral nervi conarii.<ref name="sd" /> The second set of fibers enters the pineal gland anteriorly via the commissural peduncles.<ref name="sd" /> The third set of fibers is myelinated and forms the ventro-lateral pineal tract.<ref name="sd" />

====''Function''====

The pineal gland is considered a secretory organ and its activity shows [[Circadian rhythm|circadian oscillations]].<ref name="nature" /> Its main function, secretion of the hormone [[melatonin]], dies out when there is no input from the primary circadian pacemaker in the [[Suprachiasmatic nucleus|suprachiasmatic nuclei]] (SCN).<ref name="sd" /> Melatonin production is controlled by the previously mentioned circadian timing and is suppressed by light.<ref name="sd" /> 
It has also been hypothesized that the pineal gland has a role in reproduction.<ref name="nature" /> Pineal tumors can affect sexual development,<ref name="sd" /> but the effecting mechanism has yet to be established. In addition, melatonin has also been detected in preovulatory follicles, as well as fluids related to reproduction such as semen, amniotic fluid and breast milk.<ref name="sd" />

=====Other pineal substances=====
Other peptides aside from melatonin have been detected in the pineal. They are most likely associated with a type of innervation deemed “pineal peptidergic innervation.”<ref name="sd" /> These include vasopressin, oxytocin, VIP, NPY, peptide histidine isoleucine, calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P and somastotin.<ref name="sd" /> However, these probably accumulate in the pineal but are not produced by the gland itself.
