A '''pancreatic injury''' is some form of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] sustained by the [[pancreas]]. The injury can be sustained through either [[blunt trauma|blunt forces]], such as a [[motor vehicle accident]], or [[penetrating trauma|penetrative forces]], such as that of a [[gunshot wound]].<ref name="injury">{{cite journal |author=Degiannis E, Glapa M, Loukogeorgakis SP, Smith MD |title=Management of pancreatic trauma |journal=Injury |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=21–9 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=17996869 |doi=10.1016/j.injury.2007.07.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020-1383(07)00276-8 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref> The pancreas is one of the least commonly injured organs in [[abdominal trauma]].<ref name="sage">{{cite doi|10.1191/1460408603ta261oa}}</ref>

===Diagnosis===
The diagnosis of this form of injury can be challenging because of the pancreas' location inside the abdomen.<ref name="test">{{cite doi|10.1007/s00068-007-7079-4}}</ref> The use of [[ultrasound]] can reveal fluid around the site of injury.<ref name="injury"/> [[Computed tomography]] (CT) can also be utilized as a non-invasive diagnostic tool,<ref name="test"/> but its reliability is low; one retrospective case review found that computed tomography had either failed to find injuries or had underestimated the severity of injury in more than half of 17 pancreatic injury patients.<ref name=Boffard2001/> [[Serum (blood)|Serum]] [[amylase]] has also been shown to be of limited diagnostic utility within the first three hours following injury.<ref name=Boffard2001>{{cite book|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6884/ |chapter=Pancreatic, splenic and duodenal injuries |first1=Ken |last1=Boffard |first2=Adam |last2=Brooks |title=Surgical Treatment: Evidence-Based and Problem-Oriented |editors=Holzheimer RG, Mannick JA |location=Munich |publisher=Zuckschwerdt |date=2001 |note=NCBI Bookshelf, Bookshelf ID: NBK6884}}</ref> Management of a pancreatic injury can be difficult because other [[abdominal]] [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], such as the [[liver]], usually have sustained trauma as well.<ref name="test"/><ref name="royal">{{cite journal |author=Khan MA, Cameron I |title=The management of pancreatic trauma |journal=Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps |volume=156 |issue=4 |pages=221–7 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21275354 |doi= |url= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref> Several common symptoms manifest hours after the injury such as [[tachycardia]], [[abdominal distension]], and [[epigastric|midepigastric]] [[tenderness]].<ref name="royal"/> Indications for surgical intervention include: [[peritonitis]] based on [[physical examination]]; [[hypotension]] in combination with a positive focussed assessment with sonography (ultrasound) for trauma (FAST); and [[pancreatic duct]] disruption based on the results of thin-cut computed tomography or [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]] (ERCP).<ref name="test"/> Commonly, a [[laparotomy]] is done in order to directly visualize the injury, and generally this approach is the most accurate diagnostic method.<ref name="injury"/><ref name="royal"/>

Pancreatic injuries are classified according to the criteria of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST). The grade of the trauma should be increased by one level for multiple injuries to the same organ. The description of the injury is that "based on most accurate assessment at autopsy, laparotomy, or radiological study." The pancreatic organ injury scale, as minimally modified, is:<ref name=Boffard2001/><ref>American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (from Moore EE, Cogbill TH, Malangoni MA et al (1990) J Trauma 30: 1427–1429)</ref>

===Surgical treatment===
When there is no [[pancreatic duct]] injury, typically [[hemostasis]] and surgical [[drainage]] are the main form of treatment.<ref name="injury"/><ref name="test"/><ref name=Boffard2001/> Surgical repair is undertaken when there is evidence or suspicion of ductal injury.<ref name=Boffard2001/> The type of surgery depends on the degree of the injury and its proximity to the mesenteric blood vessels that serve the pancreas. When injuries are not close to the mesenteric vessels, a distal pancreatectomy may be done; this procedure preserves much of the pancreas and usually avoids loss of its [[endocrine]] and [[exocrine]] functions.<ref name=Boffard2001/>  In severe cases of [[pancreaticoduodenal]] injury, a [[pancreaticoduodenectomy]] can be used.<ref name=Boffard2001/><ref name="demo">{{cite journal |author=Stawicki SP, Schwab CW |title=Pancreatic trauma: demographics, diagnosis, and management |journal=The American Surgeon |volume=74 |issue=12 |pages=1133–45 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19097525 |doi= |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0003-1348&volume=74&issue=12&spage=1133&aulast=Stawicki |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref> Common complications after surgery include [[pancreatitis]], [[pancreatic fistula]], [[abscess]], and [[pseudocyst]] formation.<ref name="sage"/> Initial management of [[hemorrhage]] includes controlling it by packing the wound.<ref name="royal"/><ref name="demo"/>
