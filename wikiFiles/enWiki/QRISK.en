'''QRISK2''' (the most recent version of QRISK) is a prediction algorithm for [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular disease (CVD)]] that uses traditional [[risk factor]]s ([[Ageing|age]], [[Blood pressure|systolic blood pressure]], [[smoking]] status and ratio of total serum [[cholesterol]] to [[HDL cholesterol|high-density lipoprotein cholesterol]]) together with [[body mass index]], ethnicity, measures of deprivation, [[Family history (medicine)|family history]], chronic kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, diabetes and [[Antihypertensive drug|antihypertensive treatment]].<ref name="Performance of the QRISK cardiovascular risk prediction algorithm in an independent UK sample of patients from general practice: a validation study">Heart 2008;94:34-39. [http://heart.bmj.com/content/94/1/34.full "Performance of the QRISK cardiovascular risk prediction algorithm in an independent UK sample of patients from general practice: a validation study"]. Accessed 31 March 2012.</ref> A QRISK over 20 (20% risk of CVD event over the next ten years) indicates that primary prevention with lipid lowering therapy (such as [[statin]]s) should be initiated.

In the [[UK]], current [[NICE]] guidelines urge research on the use of [http://www.qrisk.org www.qrisk.org] as a possible alternative to the more widely used [[Framingham Risk Score|Framingham risk score]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Lipid modification (CG67). [http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG67 "Cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease"]. Accessed 1 April 2012.</ref>

The algorithm has subsequently been validated by an independent team using an external dataset.<ref name="An independent external validation and evaluation of QRISK cardiovascular risk prediction: a prospective open cohort study">BMJ 2009; 339:b2584.

[http://www.qrisk.org www.qrisk.org] is updated annually to reflect changes in populations, data quality and national guidelines (such as a change in age range over which cardiovascular risk should be assessed). The inclusion of ethnicity and deprivation in the QRISK2 algorithm is designed to help prevent widening health inequalities. [http://www.qintervention.org The QIntervention website] combines [http://www.qrisk.org www.qrisk.org] with a similar risk prediction tool (www.qdiabetes.org) to calculate risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. www.qintervention.org also allows clinicians to assess 'what if' scenarios i.e. how risk might change with modification of risk factors such as weight loss, stopping smoking, use of statins and better blood pressure control. 

QRISK has also been developed further to estimate [http://www.qrisk.org/lifetime individualised lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease].<ref name="Derivation, validation, and evaluation of a new QRISK model to estimate lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease: cohort study using QResearch database">BMJ 2010;341:c6624.
