'''Vanillotoxins''' (VaTxs, subtypes VaTx1, VaTx2, and VaTx3) are [[neurotoxins]] found in the venom of the [[tarantula]] ''[[Psalmopoeus cambridgei]]''. They act as [[agonists]] for the [[transient receptor potential cation channel]] subfamily V member 1 ([[TRPV1]]), activating the pain sensory system. VaTx1 and 2 also act as antagonists for the K<sub>v</sub>2-type voltage-gated potassium channel ([[KCNB1|K<sub>v</sub>2]]), inducing paralytic behavior in small animals.<ref name="pmid17093448">{{cite journal | author = Siemens J | title = Spider toxins activate the capsaicin receptor to produce inflammatory pain | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7116 | pages = 208–212| year = 2006 | pmid = 17093448 | doi = 10.1038/nature05285 }}</ref>

== Origin ==
''P. cambridgei'', a tarantula from [[Trinidad]], uses its venom to paralyze its prey. Amongst other compounds, this venom contains all three subtypes of VaTxs: VaTx1, VaTx2, and VaTx3.<ref name="pmid17093448">{{cite journal | author = Siemens J | title = Spider toxins activate the capsaicin receptor to produce inflammatory pain | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7116 | pages = 208–212| year = 2006 | pmid = 17093448 | doi = 10.1038/nature05285 }}</ref>
The name of the toxin was derived from the vanilloid receptor TRPV1, to which the VaTxs bind.

== Chemistry ==
Vanillotoxins have close homology to other inhibitor [[cysteine knot]] (ICK) toxins.<ref name="pmid17093448">{{cite journal | author = Siemens J | title = Spider toxins activate the capsaicin receptor to produce inflammatory pain | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7116 | pages = 208–212| year = 2006 | pmid = 17093448 | doi = 10.1038/nature05285 }}</ref> ICK toxins are best known as blockers of cation channels.<ref name="pmid18061640">{{cite journal | author = Cromer B and McIntyre P | title = Painful toxins acting at TRPV1| journal = Toxicon | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–173| year = 2007 | pmid = 18061640 | doi = 10.1016/j.toxicon.2007.10.012}}</ref>
The exact structure of the VaTxs has not yet been deduced, although some preliminary models have been proposed. VaTxs are 53-82% identical in amino acid sequence.<ref name="pmid22538196">{{cite journal | author = Bohlen CJ and Julius D | title = Receptor-targeting mechanisms of pain-causing toxins: How ow? | journal = Toxicon | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 254–264| year = 2012 | pmid = 22538196 | doi = 10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.04.336}}</ref> VaTx1 and VaTx2 have an almost identical structure, while VaTx3 shows some diversity in its extruding protein loop.

== Targets ==
All three subtypes of VaTxs act as agonists for TRPV1.<ref name="pmid17093448">{{cite journal | author = Siemens J | title = Spider toxins activate the capsaicin receptor to produce inflammatory pain | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7116 | pages = 208–212| year = 2006 | pmid = 17093448 | doi = 10.1038/nature05285 }}</ref> [[EC50]] of VaTx1, VaTx2, and VaTx3 for heterologously expressed TRPV1 channels is around 12, 2.5 and 0.3 μM, respectively.<ref name="pmid17093448">{{cite journal | author = Siemens J | title = Spider toxins activate the capsaicin receptor to produce inflammatory pain | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7116 | pages = 208–212| year = 2006 | pmid = 17093448 | doi = 10.1038/nature05285 }}</ref> VaTx1 and VaTx2 also bind to the K<sub>v</sub>2 channel, although VaTx2 with a lower affinity than VaTx1. VaTx2 becomes effective on Kv2 at a minimal concentration of 40 μM.

== Mode of action ==
In humans, the effect of VaTxs has not been systematically studied. In general, the venom of ''P. cambridgei'' is known to produce pain, but the amount of toxin that is present in a bite is too low to cause serious health problems<ref name="pmid17093448">{{cite journal | author = Siemens J | title = Ion Spider toxins activate the capsaicin receptor to produce inflammatory pain | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7116 | pages = 208–212| year = 2006 | pmid = 17093448 | doi = 10.1038/nature05285 }}</ref>
. The effects of VaTxs on TRPV1 and K<sub>v</sub>2 have been studied by injecting VaTxs subcutaneously in mice.<ref name="pmid17093448">{{cite journal | author = Siemens J | title = Spider toxins activate the capsaicin receptor to produce inflammatory pain | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7116 | pages = 208–212| year = 2006 | pmid = 17093448 | doi = 10.1038/nature05285 }}</ref> VaTxs bind to the extracellular pore domain of TRPV1 in the [[peripheral nervous system]]<ref name="pmid22538196">{{cite journal | author = Bohlen CJ and Julius D | title = Receptor-targeting mechanisms of pain-causing toxins: How ow? | journal = Toxicon | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 254–264| year = 2012 | pmid = 22538196 | doi = 10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.04.336}}</ref> causing the opening of the pore and cation influx, therefore triggering the activation of the pain system. Despite the similar architecture of TRPV1 and K<sub>v</sub>2, VaTx1 and VaTx2 bind to the voltage-sensing domain of K<sub>v</sub>2 rather than the pore-domain.<ref name="pmid22538196">{{cite journal | author = Bohlen CJ and Julius D | title = Receptor-targeting mechanisms of pain-causing toxins: How ow? | journal = Toxicon | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 254–264| year = 2012 | pmid = 22538196 | doi = 10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.04.336}}</ref> By doing so, they increase the action potential threshold in the [[neuromuscular junction]], eliciting paralytic behavior.
