A cavity filled with blood, air, or both can form.<ref name="Collins07"/> The injury is diagnosed when collections of air or fluid are found on a [[CT scan]] of the chest. Surgery may be required to stitch the laceration, to drain blood, or even to remove injured parts of the lung.  The injury commonly heals quickly with few problems if it is given proper treatment; however it may be associated with scarring of the lung or other complications.

==Causes==

Pulmonary laceration is a common result of [[penetrating trauma]] but may also be caused by [[blunt trauma]]; [[rib fracture|broken ribs]] may perforate the lung, or the tissue may be torn due to [[Shear stress|shearing force]]s<ref name="Matthay05">

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Pneumothorax CT.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A CT scan of a pneumothorax, a chest injury that may accompany pulmonary laceration]]

</ref> Unlike hemothoraces that occur due to pulmonary contusion, those due to lung laceration may be large and long lasting.<ref name="Gavelli02"/> However, the lungs do not usually bleed very much because the blood vessels involved are small and the pressure within them is low.<ref name="Matthay05"/>  Therefore, pneumothorax is usually more of a problem than hemothorax.<ref name="mlr07"/> A pneumothorax may form or be turned into a [[tension pneumothorax]] by [[mechanical ventilation]], which may force air out of the tear in the lung.<ref name="Gavelli02"/>  

The laceration may also close up by itself, which can cause it to trap blood and potentially form a [[cyst]] or [[hematoma]].<ref name="mlr07"/>  Because the lung is elastic, the tear forms a round cyst called a ''traumatic air cyst'' that may be filled with air, blood, or both and that usually shrinks over a period of weeks or months.<ref name="Helms07">

A healing laceration may resemble a [[pulmonary nodule]] on radiographs, but unlike pulmonary nodules, lacerations decrease in size over time on radiographs.<ref name="MillerLA06"/>

==Treatment==
As with other chest injuries such as pulmonary contusion, hemothorax, and pneumothorax, pulmonary laceration can often be treated with just supplemental oxygen, ventilation, and drainage of fluids from the chest cavity.<ref name="Hara04">
{{cite journal |author=Hara H, Yoshimura H |title=Traumatic lung injury |language=Japanese |journal=Kyobu Geka |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=762–769 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15362557 |doi= |url=

</ref> About 5% of cases require surgery, called [[thoracotomy]].<ref name="Gwinnutt03"/> Thoracotomy is especially likely to be needed if a lung fails to re-expand; if pneumothorax, bleeding, or coughing up blood persist; or in order to remove clotted blood from a hemothorax.<ref name="Gwinnutt03"/>  Surgical treatment includes suturing,<ref name="Gwinnutt03"/> stapling, oversewing, and wedging out of the laceration.<ref name="mlr07"/>  Occasionally, surgeons must perform a [[lobectomy]], in which a lobe of the lung is removed, or a [[pneumonectomy]], in which an entire lung is removed.<ref name="Gwinnutt03"/>  

==Prognosis==

Full recovery is common with proper treatment.<ref name="Hara04"/> Pulmonary laceration usually heals quickly after a chest tube is inserted and is usually not associated with major long-term problems.<ref name="mlr07"/>  Pulmonary lacerations usually heal within three to five weeks,<ref name="Gavelli02"/> and lacerations filled with air will commonly heal within one to three weeks but on occasion take longer.<ref name="Karmy02"/> However, the injury often takes weeks or months to heal, and the lung may be [[scar]]red.<ref name="Collins07"/>   Small pulmonary lacerations frequently heal by themselves if material is removed from the [[pleura]]l space, but surgery may be required for larger lacerations that do not heal properly or that bleed.<ref name="Sartorelli04"/>

==Complications==
Complications are not common but include infection, [[pulmonary abscess]], and [[bronchopleural fistula]] (a [[fistula]] between the [[pleural space]] and the [[bronchial tree]]).<ref name="MillerLA06"/>  A bronchopleural fistula results when there is a communication between the laceration, a bronchiole, and the pleura; it can cause air to leak into the pleural space despite the placement of a chest tube.<ref name="MillerLA06"/>  The laceration can also enlarge, as may occur when the injury creates a valve that allows air to enter the laceration, progressively expanding it.<ref name="MillerLA06"/>  One complication, [[air embolism]], in which air enters the bloodstream, is potentially fatal, especially when it occurs on the left side of the heart.<ref name="Matthay05"/>  Air can enter the circulatory system through a damaged [[vein]] in the injured chest and can travel to any organ; it is especially deadly in the heart or brain.<ref name="Matthay05"/> [[Positive pressure ventilation]] can cause pulmonary embolism by forcing air out of injured lungs and into blood vessels.<ref name="Matthay05"/>
