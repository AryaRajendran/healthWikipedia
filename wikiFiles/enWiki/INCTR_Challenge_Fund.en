'''The INCTR Challenge Fund''' is the [[UK]] charity ([[Charitable organization|Charity]] No. 1079181) raising funds for projects co-ordinated by the '''International Network for Cancer Treatment Research (INCTR) '''<ref>http://www.challengefund.org/</ref> that improve the care delivered to [[cancer]] patients in [[developing country|developing countries]] and help reduce their suffering.

[[Cancer]] isn't just a disease that only affects wealthy countries. The [[World Health Organisation]] reports that of the 7.9 million death from [[cancer]] every year, 72% (5.7 million) occur in low and middle income countries.<ref>http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/index.html/</ref> This means that almost 11 people a minute are dying of [[cancer]] in some of the poorest nations on Earth. In fact, [[WHO]] reports that [[cancer]] is now killing more people in the developing countries than [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis|TB]] and [[HIV/AIDS]] combined, and this situation is growing steadily worse.

There are several reasons for this high death toll from [[cancer]] in developing countries. Due to [[poverty]], lack of resources and vast distances, public  access to [[Therapy|treatment]] maybe difficult or non-existent. There is also not enough awareness (public or [[Health care provider|professional]]) about [[cancer]] to help either [[Prevention (medical)|prevent]] the disease developing or to support [[Medical diagnosis|early diagnosis]]. As a result, 80% of [[cancer]] patients present with advanced/incurable cancers. Unfortunately, in many cases, [[palliative care]] will not be available to them at the end of their lives.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==The INCTR Challenge Fund raises money to help INCTR==
* Providing chemotherapy drugs and anti-bacteria drugs
* Training local nurses and doctors in early cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment and clinical research
* Raising the local awareness about cancer in order to encourage prevention and early diagnosis
* Providing palliative care services for terminally ill cancer patients

The charity relies on donations from individual and corporate donors.
It fundraises through social events including music gigs.<ref>http://www.challengefund.org/node/2/</ref>

==INCTR projects==
The INCTR Challenge Fund is prioritizing INCTR projects in children’s cancer (especially African [[Burkitt’s lymphoma|Burkitt lymphoma]]) and  [[palliative care]].

===Children’s cancer===
The [[survival rate]] of children suffering with cancer is lower than in high-income countries; often less than 20% compared with around 70% in the [[UK]]. Specialized units for treating children with cancer are rare in developing countries, leading to overcrowded wards and the spread of fatal [[infection]]s. This is tragic as common childhood cancers such as African [[Burkitt’s lymphoma|Burkitt lymphoma]] can be cured cheaply and efficiently if they are [[Medical diagnosis|detected]] early enough. The INCTR Challenge Fund is raising money to provide effective treatment for children with African BL in [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Uganda]]. 

The INCTR Africa Burkitt Lymphoma Programme is also supported by Christopher Niblett Memorial Fund since 2006.

===Palliative care===
Due to the scarcity of resources and the limited number of trained [[Health care provider|health care professionals]], [[palliative care]] is unavailable to most terminally ill [[cancer]] patients in low or middle income countries.  In some countries the situation may be complicated by a lack of [[Health care provider|professional]] regard (or understanding) of [[Palliative Care]] as a [[Good faith|bona fide]] part of [[cancer]] control, and by local medical and legal barriers to the use of [[opioid]]s for pain relief.<ref>http://www.painpolicy.wisc.edu/publicat/cprguid.htm#difficulties/</ref> In Nepal the INCTR Challenge Fund is building a Palliative Care Network that will help reduce the suffering of cancer patients in the Kathmandu valley.

The International Network for Cancer Treatment and Research (INCTR) is a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]], [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 1998 by the [[UICC|International Union Against Cancer (UICC)]] and the [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]] in [[Brussels]]. The INCTR’s structured programme of research [[collaboration]], education and training,  helps developing countries to develop an increased understanding of the causes and [[predisposition]] to regionally important cancers, and to increase [[survival rate]]s and the [[quality of life]] in patients with [[cancer]]. INCTR currently has branches in the [[USA]], [[France]], [[Brazil]], [[Egypt]] and [[Nepal]] and offices in the [[UK]], [[India]] and [[Tanzania]]. INCTR is supported by the [[National Cancer Institute]] of the [[USA]] and is located at the [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]] in [[Brussels]].<ref>http://www.inctr.org/</ref>
