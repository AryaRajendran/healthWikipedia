'''Noma''',<ref>From Ancient Greek νομή - nomē "spreading (of sores)" (literally "pasturage"), from νέμειν - nemein "to distribute".</ref> also known as '''cancrum oris''' or '''gangrenous stomatitis''', is a [[gangrene|gangrenous]] [[disease]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000073035|noma}}</ref> leading to [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] destruction of the face, especially the [[mouth]] and [[cheek]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Enwonwu CO |title=Noma--the ulcer of extreme poverty |journal=N.

==Causes==

Noma is a rapidly progressive, polymicrobial, opportunistic infection that occurs during periods of compromised immune function. ''[[Fusobacterium necrophorum]]'' and ''[[Prevotella intermedia]]'' are thought to be key players in the process and interact with one or more other bacterial organisms (such as ''[[Borrelia vincentii]], [[Porphyromonas gingivalis]], [[Tannerella forsynthesis]], [[Treponema denticola]], [[Staphylococcus aureus]], and nonhemolytic [[Streptococcus]]'' spp).<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|last=Neville|first=Brad|title=Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology|edition=3rd|publisher=Saunders Book Company|pages=062008. 5.11}}</ref>

The reported predisposing factors include:<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
* Malnutrition or dehydration
* Poor oral hygiene
* Poor sanitation
* Unsafe drinking water
* Proximity to unkempt livestock
* Recent illness
* Malignancy
* An immunodeficiency disorder, including [[AIDS]]

Noma was observed in [[Nazi concentration camps]] in [[World War II]], and was studied by Nazi physician [[Josef Mengele]]. In many cases a recent debilitating illness, usually [[measles]] and sometimes [[herpes simplex]], [[varicella]] (chicken pox), [[scarlet fever]], [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[gastroenteritis]] or [[bronchopneumonia]], precedes the appearance of noma as well as cancers such as [[leukemia]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In many instances the infection begins as [[necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis]] (NUG). Early presentation is unclear as noma is often well progressed at initial presentation.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Noma, unlike most infections, is able to spread through anatomic barriers such as muscle.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In the developed world, noma has virtually disappeared except for an occasional case related to immunosuppressive conditions such as [[HIV infection]], severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, or intense [[immunosuppressive therapy]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the global yearly incidence to be approximately 140,000, of which 100,000 are between 1 and 7 years old and living in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Presentation and prognosis==
[[File:Noma.png|thumb|A man suffering from noma]]
The [[mucous membrane]]s of the mouth develop [[Oral ulcer|ulcers]], and rapid, painless tissue degeneration ensues, which can degrade tissues of the bones in the face.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.allrefer.com/health/noma-info.html |title=AllRefer Health - Noma (Cancrum Oris, Gangrenous Stomatitis) |accessdate=2007-07-12 |work=}}</ref>

In a condition sometimes called '''noma pudendi''', noma can also cause tissue damage to the genitals.

The disease is associated with high [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]]<ref>Barmes DE, Enwonwu CO, Leclercq MH, Bourgeois D, Falkler WA. The need for action against oro-facial gangrene (noma). ''Trop Med Int Health'' 1997; 2: 1111-1114.</ref> and mainly affects children under the age of twelve in the poorest countries of [[Africa]]. Children in [[Asia]] and some countries of [[South America]] are also affected.  Most children who get the disease are between the ages of two and six years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.noma-project.de/htmlversion/indexhtml.html |title=The European Noma-Network |accessdate=2007-07-12 |work=}}</ref>  The [[WHO]] estimates that 500,000 people are affected, and that 140,000 new cases are reported each year.<ref>Bourgeois DM, Leclercq MH. The World Health Organization initiative on noma. ''Oral Dis'' 1999; 5: 172-174.</ref>  Estimates claim that 80-90% of noma cases die from the disease.

==Treatment==
Known in antiquity to such physicians as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]], noma was once reported around the world, including [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. With improvements in hygiene and nutrition, noma has disappeared from industrialized countries since the 20th Century, except during [[World War II]] when it was [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to [[Auschwitz]] and [[Belsen]] concentration camps.<ref name="Nazi">{{cite book | title = The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and Psychological Genocide | author = Lifton, Robert Jay | year = 1986 | publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 0-465-04905-2 | page = 361}}</ref> The disease and treatments were studied by [[Berthold Epstein]], a Czech physician and forced-labor prisoner who had recommended the study under [[Josef Mengele]]'s direction.<ref name="Nazi"/>

The progression of the disease can be halted with the use of antibiotics and improved nutrition; however, its physical effects are permanent and may require reconstructive plastic surgery to repair. Reconstruction is usually very challenging and should be delayed until full recovery (usually about one year following initial intervention).

Children and other noma survivors in [[Africa]] are helped by a few international [[charitable organizations]], such as [[Facing Africa]], a UK registered charity that helps Ethiopian sufferers. There is one dedicated noma hospital in [[Nigeria]], the Noma Children Hospital Sokoto, staffed by resident and visiting medical teams. In other countries, such as [[Ethiopia]], international charities work in collaboration with the local [[health care system]] to provide complex [[reconstructive surgery]] which can give back facial functions such as eating, speaking and smiling. Teams of volunteer medics coming from abroad are often needed to support the local capacity to address the most severe cases, which can be extremely challenging even for senior [[maxillofacial surgeon]]s.<ref>[http://projectharar.co.uk/medical_care.html Project Harar - Medical care<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On 10 June 2010 the work of such volunteer surgeons was featured in a UK [[BBC Two]] documentary presented by [[Ben Fogle]], ''Make Me a New Face: Hope for [[Africa]]'s Hidden Children''.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sqlrg Make Me a New Face: Hope for Africa's Hidden Children at bbc.co.uk]</ref><ref>[http://www.benfogle.com/585 Ben Fogle » Blog Archive » Ben’s Documentary on Noma - BBC2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
