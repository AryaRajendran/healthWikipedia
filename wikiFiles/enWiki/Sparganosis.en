'''Sparganosis''' is a [[parasite|parasitic infection]] caused by the plerocercoid [[larva]]e of diphyllobothroid [[tapeworm]]s belonging to the genus [[Spirometra]].<ref name="Medical Parasitology">John, D.T. and Petri, W.A.

==History of Discovery==

Diesing first named the Sparganum genus of cestodes in 1854. [[Patrick Manson]] first reported sparganosis and the species ''Sparganum mansoni'' in China in 1882, while making the post-mortem examination of a man in Amoy, China.<ref name="Manson" /><ref>Fantahm, H.B., and Stephens, J.W.W., and Theobald, F.V. The Animal Parasites of Man. New York: William Wood and Company, 1916.</ref> The first case of sparganosis in the United States was reported by Stiles in 1908; this was a case of infection by ''Spirometra proliferum''. Mueller first described ''Spirometra mansonoides'' in the United States in 1935.<ref name="Mueller" />

==Clinical Presentation in Humans==

Clinical presentation of sparganosis most often occurs after the larvae have migrated to a subcutaneous location. The destination of the larvae is often a tissue or muscle in the chest, abdominal wall, extremities, or scrotum, although other sites include the eyes, brain, urinary tract, pleura, pericardium, and spinal canal. The early stages of disease in humans are often [[asymptomatic]], but the spargana typically cause a painful inflammatory reaction in the tissues surrounding the subcutaneous site as they grow. Discrete subcutaneous nodules develop that may appear and disappear over a period of time. The nodules usually itch, swell, turn red, and migrate, and are often accompanied by painful edema.<ref name="Garcia">Garcia, L., and Bruckner, D.A. Diagnostic Medical Parasitology. Herndon, VA: ASM Press, 2007.</ref><ref name="GIDEON" /> Seizures, hemiparesis, and headaches are also common symptoms of sparganosis, especially cerebral sparganosis, and eosinophilia is a common sign.<ref name="Medical Parasitology" /><ref name="GIDEON" />  Clinical symptoms also vary according to the location of the sparganum; possible symptoms include [[elephantitis]] from location in the lymph channels, [[peritonitis]] from location in the intestinal perforation, and [[brain abscess]]es from location in the brain.<ref name="Garcia" /> In genital sparganosis, subcutaneous nodules are present in the groin, labia, or scrotum and may appear tumor-like.<ref name="GIDEON" /> 

[[human eye|Ocular]] sparganosis a particularly well-described type of sparganosis. Early signs of the ocular form include eye pain, epiphora (excessive watering of the eye), and/or ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid). Other signs include periorbital edema and/or edematous swelling that resembles Romana’s sign in Chagas disease, lacrimation,  orbital cellulitis, exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeball), and/or an exposed cornea ulcer.<ref name="Garcia" /><ref name="Walker">Walker, M.D., and Zunt, Z.R.. “Neuroparasitic Infections: Cestodes, Trematodes, and Protozoans.” Seminars in Neurology 25.3 (2005): 262-277.</ref> The most common sign at presentation is a mass lesion in the eye. If untreated, ocular sparganosis can lead to blindness.<ref>Yang, J.W., Lee, J.H., and Kang, M.S. “A Case of Ocular Sparganosis.” Korean Journal of Ophthalmology. 21.1 (2007): 48-50.</ref>

==Transmission==

The parasite is transmitted to humans in three different ways. First, humans may acquire the infection by drinking water that is contaminated with copepods housing Spirometra larvae.<ref name="Hughes" />  Second, humans may acquire the infection by consuming the raw flesh of one of the second intermediate hosts, such as frogs or snakes.<ref name="Garcia" />  For example, humans consume raw snakes or tadpoles for medicinal purposes in some Asian cultures; if the snakes or tadpoles are infected, the larvae may be transmitted to humans. Third, humans may acquire the infection by placing raw [[poultice]]s of the second intermediate hosts on open wounds, lesions, and/or the eyes for medicinal or ritualistic reasons. If the poultice is infected with plerocercoid larvae, the human also may become infected.<ref name="Medical Parasitology" /><ref name="Walker" /> According to Zunt et al., human infection most often occurs following ingestion of infected raw snake, frog, or pig, although contact with infected flesh of an intermediate host can also cause infection.  The high prevalence in Korea may be explained by the ingestion of dog meat. In the Western hemisphere, the most common cause of infection is drinking contaminated water.<ref name="Walker" />

==Hosts, Reservoirs, and Vectors==

Definitive hosts of Spirometra include dogs, cats, birds, and wild carnivores, while humans are accidental hosts.<ref name="Medical Parasitology" /><ref name="Hughes" /><ref name="Walker" /> First intermediate hosts include copepods and other fresh-water crustaceans, while second intermediate hosts include birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The intermediate hosts are also the reservoirs of Spirometra. There are no vectors of Spirometra.<ref name="GIDEON" />

==Incubation Period==

The incubation period of Spirometra is 20 days to 3 years.<ref name="GIDEON" />

==Morphology==
The sparganum larvae are white, wrinkled, and ribbon-shaped. They range from a few millimeters in length to several centimenters. The anterior end can invaginate and bears suggestions of the sucking grooves that are present in the [[scolex]] of the mature worm.<ref name="Medical Parasitology" />  The absence of a scolex or protoscolex in Spirometra is a key difference in differentiating between ''Taenia solium'' and Spirometra.<ref name="Iwatani">Iwatani, K.,Kubota, I., Hirotsu, Y., et al. “Sparganum mansoni parasitic infection in the lung showing a nodule.” Pathology International. 56(11): 674-7.</ref>  The worm’s body is also characterized by a stromal network of smooth muscle.  In general, plerocercoids in the East (''S. mansoni'') are described as larger and more delicate than those in the West.<ref name="Mueller">Mueller, J.F. and Coulston, F. “Experimental human infection with the sparganum larva of Spirometra mansonoides.” The American Journal of Tropical Medicine nad Hygiene. 21(3):399.</ref>

The eggs of ''S. mansonoides'' provide an example of the general morphological characteristics of Spirometra eggs. ''S. mansonoides'' eggs resemble the eggs of ''D. latum'', with some specific differences. ''S. mansonoides'' eggs measure 57-66&nbsp;µm by 33-37&nbsp;µm, which is smaller than the eggs of ''D. latum''. The eggs of ''S. mansonoides'' are also ellipsoidal and have a conical, prominent operculum.<ref>Ash, L.R. and Orihel,T.C.. Atlas of Human Parasitology. Chicago: ASCP Press, 1990.</ref>

==Life cycle==

The adult Spirometra live in the [[small intestine]] of the definitive host—a dog, cat, raccoon, or other mammal—for up to 9 years, where they produce many eggs.<ref name="Garcia" /><ref name="GIDEON" /><ref name="Mueller" />  When the host defecates, the unembryonated eggs leave the body in the feces and hatch when they reach fresh water. The eggs are eaten by copepods (crustaceans of the genus Cyclops), which are the first intermediate hosts.<ref name="GIDEON" /> In the copepods, the eggs develop into procercoid larvae that live in the body cavity.<ref name="Garcia" /> The second intermediate hosts include fish, reptiles, or amphibians that consume the copepods. The larvae penetrate the intestinal tract of the second intermediate host, where they become plerocercoid larvae and proliferate to the subcutaneous tissues and muscles. The second intermediate host is eventually eaten by a definitive host predator, such as a dog, and the cycle begins again.<ref>CDC. “Sparganosis.”  Date viewed February 25, 2009.  <http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/html/ImageLibrary/S-Z/Sparganosis/body_Sparganosis_il4.htm>.</ref><ref name="Walker" /> Humans are accidental hosts in the cycle, becoming infected with the plerocercoid larvae by contact with or ingestion of the first or second intermediate hosts.<ref name="Garcia" /> The larvae migrate to the subcutaneous tissues in humans; however, no development takes place and the human is not capable of transmitting the disease. In ''S. proliferum'', large numbers of larvae, rather than just a few, proliferate throughout the subcutaneous tissues of humans.<ref name="GIDEON" />

==Diagnostic Tests==

Sparganosis is typically diagnosed following surgical removal of the worms, although the infection may also be diagnosed by identification of eosinophilia or identification of the parasite in a tissue specimen. If such biopsy and excision procedures are not feasible, the antisparganum [[ELISA]] test may be used.<ref name="Walker" /> In theory, a pre-operative diagnosis could be made by identification of exposure history and a painful, migratory, subcutaneous nodule. Sparganosis usually presents as a single nodule, while other cestode infections such as cysticercosis typically present as multiple nodules. Preoperative diagnosis, however, is rare.<ref name="Medical Parasitology" /><ref name="Iwatani" />

CT and MRI scans are especially useful for diagnosis of cerebral sparganosis, as they reveal lesions in the brain. Through a retrospective analysis of 25 cases of cerebral sparganosis from 2000 to 2006, Song et al. found a number of characteristic signs that could be used in the future to diagnose cerebral sparganosis without performing an excision or tissue biopsy. The most characteristic finding was the “tunnel sign” on MRI images, while the most common finding was multiple conglomerated ring-shaped enhancements. These findings led Song et al. to suggest that clinical history, ELISA, and either MRI or CT scans could be sufficient to make a sparganosis diagnosis. It is important to note, however, that these lesions are sometimes mistaken for tuberculosis lesions.<ref>Rengarajan, S., Nanjegowda, N., and Bhat, D. “Cerebral sparganosis: a diagnostic challenge.” British Journal of Neurosurgery. 22.6 (2008): 784-786.</ref>

==Management and Therapy==

One treatment for sparganosis is praziquantel, administered at a dose of 120 to 150&nbsp;mg/kg body weight over 2 days; however, praziquantel has had limited success. In general, surgical removal of one or a few sparganum larvae is often the best treatment.<ref name="Medical Parasitology" /><ref name="Walker" />

==Epidemiology==

Sparganosis is endemic or potentially endemic in 48 countries, and although rare, cases have been described in Asia, Africa, Australia, South America, and the United States.<ref name="Medical Parasitology" /><ref name="GIDEON" /><ref name="Walker" /> The majority of cases occur in Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa.<ref name="GIDEON" /> Ocular sparganosis is especially prevalent in China and Vietnam.<ref name="Medical Parasitology" /> The highest numbers of cases occur in Korea and Japan.<ref name="Walker" /> As of 2003, only seven cases of sparganosis had ever been described in Europe.<ref name="Pam">Pampliglione S., Fioravanti M.L., and Rivasi, F. “Human sparganosis in Italy. Case report and review of the European cases.” APMIS. 111(2): 2003: 349-54.</ref>

==Public Health and Prevention Strategies==

Because sparganosis is a rare infection, public health strategies have not made its prevention a priority. To prevent future sparganosis infections, public health strategies should focus on providing basic access to clean water. In their retrospective study of 25 cases of cerebral sparganosis, Song et al. found that 12 patients (48%) had eaten raw or uncooked frog or snake that was infected with sparganum, 5 patients (20%) had applied an animal’s flesh as a poultice to an open wound, and 4 patients had drunk contaminated water (the remaining 4 patients had no known history of being infected). As a result of these findings, Song et al. conclude that health education about sparganosis and the importance of food sanitation should be implemented in all rural endemic areas.<ref>Song, T., Wang, W.S., and W.W. Mai. “CT and MR Characteristics of Cerebral Sparganosis.” AJNR. 28 (2007): 1700-1705.</ref> All water in endemic areas should be boiled or treated to prevent ingestion of Cyclops or Spirometra larvae. Especially in areas where ponds or ditches provide potential habitats for infected copepods, public health strategies should include education campaigns about how to identify drinking water that could potentially be infected. Finally, strategies should warn people against ingesting the raw flesh of the intermediate hosts, such as snakes and frogs, and against using them as poultices.<ref name="Medical Parasitology" />
