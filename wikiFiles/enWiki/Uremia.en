'''Uremia''' or '''uraemia''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#ae and oe|spelling differences]]) is a term used to loosely describe the illness accompanying [[renal failure|kidney failure]] (also called renal failure), in particular the nitrogenous waste products associated with the failure of this organ.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000113275|uremia}}</ref> This is not to be confused with [[Hyperuricemia|uricemia]], or [[hyperuricemia]], a build up of uric acid in the blood.

In kidney failure, [[urea]] and other waste products, which are normally excreted into the [[urine]], are retained in the blood. Early symptoms include [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and lethargy, and late symptoms can include decreased mental acuity and coma. Other symptoms include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, cold, bone pain, itch, shortness of breath, and seizures. It is usually diagnosed in [[kidney dialysis]] patients when the [[glomerular filtration rate]], a measure of kidney function, is below 50% of normal.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Meyer TW and Hostetter, TH| title=Uremia | journal=N Engl J Med | volume=357 | issue=13 | pages=1316–25 | year=2007 | pmid=17898101 | doi=10.1056/NEJMra071313 }}</ref> 

'''[[Azotemia]]''' is another word that refers to high levels of urea, but is used primarily when the abnormality can be measured chemically but is not yet so severe as to produce symptoms. Uremia can also result in [[uremic pericarditis]]. There are many dysfunctions caused by uremia affecting many systems of the body, such as blood (lower levels of erythropoietin), sex (lower levels of testosterone/estrogen), and bones (osteoporosis and metastatic calcifications). Uremia can also cause decreased peripheral conversion of [[Thyroxine|T4]] to [[Triiodothyronine|T3]], producing a functionally hypothyroid state.

Because uremia is mostly a consequence of kidney failure, its signs and symptoms often occur concomitantly with other signs and symptoms of kidney failure, such as hypertension due to volume overload, hypocalcemic tetany, and anemia due to [[erythropoietin]] deficiency.<ref name=Meyer2007/> These, however, are not signs or symptoms of uremia.<ref name=Meyer2007/> Still, it is not certain that the symptoms currently associated with uremia are actually caused by excess urea, as one study showed that uremic symptoms were relieved by initiation of dialysis, even when urea was added to the dialysate to maintain the blood urea nitrogen level at approximately 90&nbsp;mg per deciliter (that is, approximately 32&nbsp;mmol per liter).<ref name=Meyer2007/>

{{Bleeding worksheet}}

==Causes==
Besides [[renal failure]], the level of urea in the blood can also be increased by:
* increased production of urea in the liver, due to:
** high protein diet
** increased protein breakdown (surgery, infection, trauma, cancer)
** gastrointestinal bleeding
** drugs (e.g. [[tetracyclines]] and [[corticosteroids]])

* decreased elimination of urea, due to:
** decreased blood flow through kidney (e.g. [[hypotension]], cardiac failure)
** urinary outflow obstruction
** [[bladder rupture]]

* dehydration
* chronic infection of the kidney such as chronic [[pyelonephritis]]
