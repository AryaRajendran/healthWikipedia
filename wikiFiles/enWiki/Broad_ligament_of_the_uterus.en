The '''broad ligament of the uterus''' is the wide fold of [[peritoneum]] that connects the sides of the [[uterus]] to the walls and floor of the [[pelvis]]. 

==Subdivisions==

The broad ligament may be divided into three subcomponents:<ref>{{EmbryologySwiss|ugenital/diffmorpho05}}</ref>
* [[Mesometrium]] - the mesentery of the uterus; the largest portion of the broad ligament
* [[Mesosalpinx]] - the mesentery of the [[Fallopian tube]]
* [[Mesovarium]] - the mesentery of the ovaries.

==Contents==
The contents of the broad ligament include the following:<ref>{{NormanAnatomy|pelvis}} ({{NormanAnatomyFig|uterus}}, {{NormanAnatomyFig|broadligament}})</ref>

* Reproductive
** Uterine tubes (or [[Fallopian tube]])
** ovary (some sources consider the ovary to be on the broad ligament, but not in it.)<ref name="isbn0-7817-5309-0">{{cite book |author=Kyung Won, PhD.

** [[uterine artery]]
* ligaments
** [[ovarian ligament]] 
** [[round ligament of uterus]]
** [[suspensory ligament of the ovary]] (Some sources consider it a part of the broad ligament while other sources just consider it a "termination" of the ligament.<ref name="SUNY">{{SUNYAnatomyLabs|43|03|03|00}}</ref>)

==Structure==

The [[peritoneum]] surrounds the [[uterus]] like a flat sheet that is folded over the uterus; on the sides of the uterus, this sheet of peritoneum comes in direct contact with itself, forming the double layer of peritoneum known as the broad ligament of the uterus. 

The part where this peritoneal sheet is folded (i.e. the free edge) has the [[uterine tube]]s running between the two layers; this part is known as the [[mesosalpinx]].

==Function==
The broad ligament serves as a mesentery for the uterus, ovaries, and the uterine tubes.  It helps in maintaining the uterus in its position,but it is not a major contributing factor.
