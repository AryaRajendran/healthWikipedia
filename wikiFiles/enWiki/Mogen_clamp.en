==History and prevalence==
Rabbi Harry Bronstein, a [[mohel]] from [[Brooklyn]], invented the Mogen clamp in 1954.  The name "Mogen" was derived from the Hebrew word מגן (''magen''), which means [[shield]].  Bronstein hoped to standardize circumcision equipment for mohels and doctors.<ref name="latimes-2011"/>  Medical literature reports that the Mogen clamp is (probably) the third most popular circumcision clamp (after Plastibell and Gomco) used by medical practitioners in hospitals.<ref name=Strimling>{{cite journal |pmid=8657537 |year=1996 |last1=Strimling |first1=BS |title=Partial amputation of glans penis during Mogen clamp circumcision |volume=97 |issue=6 Pt 1 |pages=906–7 |journal=Pediatrics}}</ref>

==Procedure==
The hospital circumcision procedure with the Mogen clamp is as follows:

# Apply [[local anesthetic]]
# Use [[hemostat]]s to draw the [[foreskin]] forward
# Break any [[adhesion (medicine)|adhesion]]s from the foreskin to the [[glans penis]]
# Place the Mogen clamp over the foreskin following the angle of the [[Corona of glans penis|corona]], ensuring the glans is not trapped
# Use the Mogen clamp arm to close the clamp, crushing the foreskin along a line that is 1mm wide
# Excise the foreskin [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Proximal_and_distal|distal]] to the clamp
# Release the clamp arm and remove the clamp
# Liberate the glans by pulling the crush line apart
# Bandage<ref name="Reynolds">{{cite journal |pmid=8677833 |year=1996 |last1=Reynolds |first1=RD |title=Use of the Mogen clamp for neonatal circumcision |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=177–82 |journal=American family physician}}</ref><ref name="Duterte">{{cite video | url=http://newborns.stanford.edu/Mogen.html | title=Circumcision -- Mogen Technique | publisher=Stanford School of Medicine | people=Dr. Brendan Duterte, performing physician; Janelle Aby, MD, producer}}</ref>

The hospital procedure usually takes three to four minutes and is virtually bloodless.<ref name=Duterte/>

==Newborn post-procedure care==
*Remove the bandage 48 hours after the procedure
*Clean the penis by washing gently with water several times per day<ref name="Kaiser">{{cite web | url=http://www.permanente.net/kaiser/pdf/3558.pdf | title=Newborn Circumcision Information | publisher=Kaiser Permanente | accessdate=April 30, 2012 | pages=2}}</ref>

*One size of the Mogen fits all<ref name="Strimling"/>

==Disadvantages==
*Device does not directly protect the glans during the procedure<ref name="Duterte"/>

==Complications specific to the Mogen clamp==
A 1984 study of 313 circumcisions using the Mogen clamp states "Circumcision using the Mogen clamp is a simple quick, and safe procedure." The study showed that the "complication rate was low (1.6%)."<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6499347 |year=1984 |last1=Kaweblum |first1=YA |last2=Press |first2=S |last3=Kogan |first3=L |last4=Levine |first4=M |last5=Kaweblum |first5=M |title=Circumcision using the Mogen clamp |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=679–82 |journal=Clinical pediatrics |doi=10.1177/000992288402301204}}</ref>

==Lawsuits==
A Massachusetts lawsuit regarding a circumcision performed using Mogen Circumcision Instruments' clamp resulted in a $7.5 million judgement against Mogen Circumcision Instruments of New York in 2007. This judgment caused Mogen to go into default. <ref name="LATimes">{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/26/health/la-he-circumcision-20110926 | title=Injuries linked to circumcision clamps | date=September 26, 2011 | accessdate=Jul 30, 2012 | author=Molly Hennessy-Fiske}}</ref>

In a case in which 85% of a child's glans penis was accidentally amputated, and could not be reattached, a lawsuit was filed against Miltex Inc., Miltex Inc.'s parent company Integra Life Sciences Holding Corp., and the doctor who performed the circumcision. Miltex Inc. and Integra Life Sciences Holding Corp. were ordered to pay the child and his mother $4.6 million. The lawsuit against the doctor was dismissed.<ref name="latimes-2011"/><ref>[http://www.myfoxla.com/dpp/news/local/settlement-in-botched-circumcision-lawsuit-20110718 "$4.6M Settlement in Botched Circumcision Lawsuit] [[Fox News|My Fox LA]], Published July 18, 2011</ref><ref>[http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2011/07/18/boys-family-to-receive-4-6m-for-botched-circumcision/ Boy's Family To Receive $4.6M For Botched Circumcision] [[CBS]] Los Angeles, Published July 18, 2011</ref>
