The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has acknowledged the "anxiety and speculation" regarding [[electromagnetic field]]s (EMFs) and their alleged  effects on public health.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.who.int/peh-emf/en/|title= Electromagnetic fields (EMF)|accessdate=2008-01-22|date= |work= |language= |publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}} “Electromagnetic fields of all frequencies represent one of the most common and fastest growing environmental influences, about which anxiety and speculation are spreading. All populations are now exposed to varying degrees of EMF, and the levels will continue to increase as technology advances.”</ref> 

In response to public concern, the WHO established the ''International EMF Project'' in 1996 to assess the scientific evidence of possible health effects of EMF in the frequency range from 0 to 300&nbsp;GHz. They have stated that although extensive research has been conducted into possible health effects of exposure to many parts of the frequency spectrum, all reviews conducted so far have indicated that exposures are below the limits recommended in the [[International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection|ICNIRP]] (1998) EMF guidelines, covering the full frequency range from 0–300&nbsp;GHz, and do not produce any known adverse health effect. <ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.who.int/peh-emf/research/en/|title= WHO EMF Research|accessdate=2012-03-27|date= |work= |language= en|publisher= [[World Health Organisation]]}}</ref>

International guidelines on exposure levels to [[microwave]] frequency EMFs such as ICNIRP limit the power levels of wireless devices and it is uncommon for wireless devices to exceed the guidelines. These guidelines only take into account thermal effects, as nonthermal effects have not been conclusively demonstrated.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Levitt|first= B.

==Exposure difference to mobile phones==
{{Main|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
Users of wireless devices are typically exposed for much longer periods than for [[mobile phone]]s and the strength of wireless devices is not significantly less.  Whereas a mobile phone can range from 21 [[dBm]] (125&nbsp;mW) for Power Class 4 to 33 [[dBm]] (2W) for Power class 1, a [[wireless router]] can range from a typical 15 [[dBm]] (30&nbsp;mW) strength to 27 [[dBm]] (500&nbsp;mW) on the high end.<ref>[[dBm]]</ref>

However, wireless routers are typically located significantly farther away from users' heads than a mobile phone the user is handling, resulting in far less exposure overall.  The [[Health Protection Agency]] (HPA) claims that if a person spends one year in a Wi-Fi hotspot, they will receive the same dose of radio waves as if they had made a 20-minute call on a mobile phone.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Wi-fi health fears are 'unproven'|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6676129.stm|work= [[BBC News]]|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 2007-05-21|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> 

The HPA also acknowledges that due to the mobile phone's adaptive power ability, a DECT cordless phone's radiation could actually exceed the radiation of a mobile phone.  The HPA explains that while the DECT cordless phone's radiation has an average output power of 10&nbsp;mW, it is actually in the form of 100 bursts per second of 250&nbsp;mW, a strength comparable to some mobile phones.<ref>http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/Radiation/UnderstandingRadiation/InformationSheets/info_CordlessTelephones/</ref>

==Wireless LAN==
Most [[wireless LAN]] equipment is designed to work within predefined standards. Wireless access points are also often close to humans, but the drop off in power over distance is fast, following the [[inverse-square law]].<ref name="Foster2007">{{Cite journal|last= Foster|first= Kenneth R|title= Radiofrequency exposure from wireless LANs utilizing Wi-Fi technology|year= 2007|month= March|journal= Health Physics|volume= 92|issue= 3|pages= 280–289|doi= 10.1097/01.HP.0000248117.74843.34|pmid= 17293700}}</ref>  However, wireless laptops are typically used close to humans.  WiFi has been anecdotally linked to [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], e.g., in Toronto, Canada schoolchildren as well as staff workers of France National Library.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/08/15/ontario-wifi.html | work=CBC News | title=Ont. parents suspect Wi-Fi making kids sick | date=2010-08-16}}</ref>

The [[Health Protection Agency|HPA's]] position is that “...radio frequency (RF) exposures from WiFi are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones.” It also saw “...no reason why schools and others should not use WiFi equipment.”<ref name="HPAWiFi">{{Cite web|url= http://www.hpa.org.uk/HPA/Topics/Radiation/UnderstandingRadiation/1199451940308/|title= WiFi|accessdate=2009-12-27 |date= 2009-10-26 |work= |language= |publisher= [[Health Protection Agency]]}}</ref> In October 2007, the HPA launched a new “systematic” study into the effects of WiFi networks on behalf of the UK government, in order to calm fears that had appeared in the media in a recent period up to that time".<ref name="HPAWiFiStudy">{{Cite web|url= http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1195733726123?p=1171991026241|title= Health Protection Agency announces further research into use of WiFi|accessdate=2008-08-28|date= |work= |language= |publisher= [[Health Protection Agency]]}}</ref> Dr Michael Clark, of the HPA, says published research on [[mobile phones]] and [[radio masts and towers|masts]] does not add up to an indictment of WiFi.<ref>{{Cite news| first= Nicki| last= Daniels| coauthors= | title=Wi-fi: should we be worried? | date= 2006-12-11| publisher= | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article665419.ece | work =[[The Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-16 | quote = All the expert reviews done here and abroad indicate that there is unlikely to be a health risk from wireless networks. … When we have conducted measurements in schools, typical exposures from WiFi are around 20 millionths of the international guideline levels of exposure to radiation. As a comparison, a child on a mobile phone receives up to 50 per cent of guideline levels. So a year sitting in a classroom near a wireless network is roughly equivalent to 20 minutes on a mobile. If WiFi should be taken out of schools, then the mobile phone network should be shut down, too—and FM radio and TV, as the strength of their signals is similar to that from WiFi in classrooms.... | language =  | location=London}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=January 2012}}

==Bluetooth==
[[Bluetooth]] also uses the microwave frequency spectrum in the range of 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 2.4835&nbsp;GHz. The radiated output power of [[Bluetooth]] devices varies between 1 and 100&nbsp;mW, and can operate continuously or sporadically (on demand), so total exposure to EMF radiation is quite variable. Bluetooth devices have not been linked with any health issues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Other devices==
[[Radio frequency]] in the microwave and radio spectrum is used in a number of practical devices for professional and home use, such as:
* [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications|DECT]] and other [[cordless telephone|cordless phones]] operating at a wide  range of frequencies
* [[Remote control]] devices for opening gates, etc.
* Portable two-way [[radio]] communication devices, such as [[walkie-talkies]]
* Wireless [[security]] (alarm) systems
* Wireless security [[video cameras]]
* Radio links between buildings for [[data communication]]
* [[Baby monitor]]s
* [[Smart meter]]s for electric energy

In addition, electrical and electronic devices of all kinds emit EM fields around their working circuits, generated by [[alternate current|oscillating currents]]. Humans are in daily contact with [[computers]], [[Computer display|video display monitors]], [[TV]] screens, [[microwave ovens]], [[fluorescent lamps]], [[electric motors]] of several kinds (such as [[washing machines]], kitchen appliances [like electric can openers, blenders, and mixers], water pumps, etc.) and many others. A study of bedroom exposure in 2009 showed the highest ELF-EF from bedside lights and the highest ELF-MF from transformer devices, while the highest RF-ELF came from DECT cordless phones and outside cellphone base stations; all exposures were well below [[International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection]] (ICNIRP) guideline levels.<ref name="Tomitsch2009">{{Cite journal|last1= Tomitsch|first1= Johannes|last2= Dechant|first2= Engelbert|last3= Frank|first3= Wilhelm|title= Survey of electromagnetic field exposure in bedrooms of residences in lower Austria|date= 2009-09-24|journal= Bioelectromagnetics|issue= Epub ahead of print|doi= 10.1002/bem.20548 |pmid= 19780092}}</ref> 

The highest typical daily exposure, according to a study of 2009, came from cellphone base stations, cellphones and DECT cordless phones, with the highest exposure locations in trains, airports and buses.<ref name="Frei2009">{{Cite journal|last1= Frei|first1= Patrizia|last2= Mohler|first2= Evelyn|last3= Neubauer|first3= Georg|last4= Theis|first4= Gaston|last5= Bürgi|first5= Alfred|last6= Fröhlich|first6= Jürg|last7= Braun-Fahrländer|first7= Charlotte|last8= Bolte|first8= John|last9= Egger|first9= Matthias|last10= Röösli|first10= Martin|title= Temporal and spatial variability of personal exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields|year= 2009|month= August|journal= Environmental Research|volume= 109|issue= 6|pages= 779–785|doi= 10.1016/j.envres.2009.04.015 |pmid= 19476932}}</ref> The typical background power of electromagnetic fields in the home can vary from zero to 5 milliwatts per meter squared.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Long-time effects of these electromagnetic fields on human and animal health are still unknown.
