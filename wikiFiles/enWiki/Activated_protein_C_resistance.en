'''Activated protein C resistance''' (APCR) is a [[hemostasis|hemostatic disorder]] characterized by a poor [[anticoagulant]] response to activated [[protein C]] (APC). This results in an increased risk of [[venous thrombosis]], which can cause problems with circulation, such as [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dahlbäck B |title=The discovery of activated protein C resistance |journal=J. Thromb. Haemost. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=3–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12871530 |doi=10.1046/j.1538-7836.2003.00016.x}}</ref>

The disorder can be acquired or inherited, the hereditary form having an [[autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] inheritance pattern.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7902898 |year=1993 |month=December |author=Koster T, Rosendaal FR, De Ronde H, Briët E, Vandenbroucke JP, Bertina RM |title=Venous thrombosis due to poor anticoagulant response to activated protein C: Leiden Thrombophilia Study |volume=342 |issue=8886–8887 |pages=1503–6 |issn=0140-6736 |journal=Lancet |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)80081-9}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Protein C anticoagulant.jpg|thumb|'''Protein C Anticoagulant Pathway''':  Thrombin escaping from a site of vascular injury binds to its receptor thrombomodulin (TM) on the intact cell surface. As a result, thrombin loses its procoagulant properties and instead becomes a potent activator of protein C. Activated protein C (APC) functions as a circulating anticoagulant, which specifically degrades and inactivates the phospholipid-bound factors Va and VIIIa. This effectively down-regulates the coagulation cascade and limits clot formation to sites of vascular injury. T = Thrombin, PC= Protein C, Activated Protein C= APC, PS= Protein S]]

Activated protein C (with protein S as a cofactor) degrades [[Factor V]]a and [[Factor VIII]]a. Activated protein C resistance is the inability of protein C to cleave [[Factor V]]a and/or [[Factor VIII]]a, which allows for longer duration of thrombin generation and may lead to a hypercoagulable state. This may be hereditary or acquired.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nicolaes GA, Dahlbäck B |title=Congenital and acquired activated protein C resistance |journal=Semin Vasc Med |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=33–46 |year=2003 |pmid=15199491 |doi=10.1055/s-2003-38331}}</ref> The best known and most common hereditary form is [[Factor V Leiden]]. Acquired forms occur in the presence of elevated Factor VIII concentrations.
