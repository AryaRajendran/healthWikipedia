'''Follicular thyroid cancer''' accounts for 15% of [[thyroid cancer]] and occurs more commonly in women over 50 years of age. [[Thyroglobulin]] (Tg) can be used as a [[tumor marker]] for well-differentiated follicular thyroid cancer.

==Classification==
It is impossible to distinguish between follicular adenoma and carcinoma on cytological grounds. If [[fine needle aspiration cytology]] (FNAC) suggests follicular neoplasm, thyroid lobectomy should be performed to establish the [[Histopathology|histopathological]] diagnosis.  Features sine qua non for the diagnosis of follicular carcinoma are capsular invasion and vascular invasion by tumor cells. Still, focuses of the capsular invasion should be carefully evaluated and discriminated from the capsular rupture due to [[Fine-needle aspiration|FNA]] penetration resulting in WHAFFT (''worrisome histologic alterations following FNA of thyroid'').

* Follicular carcinoma tends to metastasize to [[lung]] and [[bone]] via the bloodstream.
* [[Papillary thyroid carcinoma]] commonly metastasizes to [[cervical lymph nodes]].

[[HMGA2]] has been proposed as a marker to identify malignant tumors.<ref name="pmid17943974">{{cite journal |author=Belge G |title=Upregulation of HMGA2 in thyroid carcinomas: A novel molecular marker to distinguish between benign and malignant follicular neoplasias |journal=Genes Chromosomes Cancer |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=56–63 |year=2008 |pmid=17943974 |doi=10.1002/gcc.20505 |author-separator=, |author2=Meyer A |author3=Klemke M |display-authors=3 |last4=Burchardt |first4=Käte |last5=Stern |first5=Corinna |last6=Wosniok |first6=Werner |last7=Loeschke |first7=Siegfried |last8=Bullerdiek |first8=Jörn}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment is usually surgical, followed by radioiodine.

===Initial treatment===
*If follicular cells are found on cytological testing, it is common to carry out ''hemithyroidectomy'' to distinguish between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma on histopathological examination, proceeding to ''completion thyroidectomy'' and postoperative radioiodine ablation where carcinoma is confirmed.  This way total thyroidectomy is not carried out unnecessarily.
*''[[Thyroidectomy]]'' is invariably followed by [[radioiodine]] treatment at levels from 50 to 200 [[millicurie]]s following two weeks of a low iodine diet (LID). Occasionally treatment must be repeated if annual scans indicate remaining cancerous tissue. Some physicians favor administering the maximum safe dose (calculated based on a number of factors), while others favor administering smaller doses, which may still be effective in ablating all thyroid tissue. I-131 is used for ablation of the thyroid tissue.
**[[Minimally invasive procedure|Minimally invasive]] thyroidectomy has been used in recent years in cases where the nodules are small.<ref name="pmid17653588">{{cite journal |author=Hegazy MA |title=Minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy for small follicular thyroid nodules |journal=World J Surg |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=1743–50 |year=2007 |pmid=17653588 |doi=10.1007/s00268-007-9147-7 |author-separator=, |author2=Khater AA |author3=Setit AE |display-authors=3 |last4=Amin |first4=Mahmoud A. |last5=Kotb |first5=Sherif Z. |last6=Shafei |first6=Mohamed A. El |last7=Yousef |first7=Tamer F. |last8=Hussein |first8=Osama |last9=Shabana |first9=Yousef K.}}</ref>

===Finding disease recurrence===
Some studies have shown that thyroglobulin (Tg) testing combined with neck [[ultrasound]] is more productive in finding disease recurrence than full- or [[Full-body scan|whole-body scans]] (WBS) using radioactive iodine. However, current protocol (in the USA) suggests a small number of clean annual WBS are required before relying on Tg testing plus neck ultrasound. When needed, whole body scans consist of withdrawal from thyroxine medication and/or injection of recombinant human [[Thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH). In both cases, a low iodine diet regimen must also be followed to optimize the takeup of the radioactive iodine dose. Low dose radioiodine of a few millicuries is administered. Full body [[nuclear medicine]] scan follows using a [[gamma camera]]. Scan doses of radioactive iodine may be [[Iodine-131|I<sup>131</sup>]] or [[Iodine-123|I<sup>123</sup>]].

Recombinant human TSH, commercial name [[Thyrogen]], is produced in cell culture from genetically engineered [[hamster]] cells.

==Hurthle cell variant==

[[Hurthle cell]] thyroid cancer is often considered a variant of follicular cell carcinoma.<ref name="pmid18070728">{{cite journal |author=Kushchayeva Y, Duh QY, Kebebew E, D'Avanzo A, Clark OH |title=Comparison of clinical characteristics at diagnosis and during follow-up in 118 patients with Hurthle cell or follicular thyroid cancer |journal=Am J Surg |volume= 195|issue= 4|pages= 457–62|year=2007 |pmid=18070728 |doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2007.06.001}}</ref><ref>Hu MI, Vassilopoulou-Sellin R, Lustig R, Lamont JP.

Like follicular carcinoma, unilateral hemithyroidectomy is performed for non-invasive disease, and total thyroidectomy for invasive disease.

==Prognosis==
The overall [[5-year survival rate]] for follicular thyroid cancer is 91%, and the 10-year survival rate is 85%.<ref name=ncd>Numbers from National Cancer Database in the US, from [http://books.google.se/books?id=u1aFpF-EcgwC&pg=PA10 Page 10] in: {{cite book |author=F.

By overall [[cancer staging]] into stages I to IV, follicular thyroid cancer has a [[5-year survival rate]] of 100% for stages I and II, 71% for stage III, and 50% for stage IV.<ref name=acc>[http://www.cancer.org/cancer/thyroidcancer/detailedguide/thyroid-cancer-survival-rates cancer.org > Thyroid Cancer] By the American Cancer Society.

==Associated mutations==
Approximately one-half of follicular thyroid carcinomas have mutations in the [[Ras subfamily]] of oncogenes, most notably [[HRAS]], [[Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog|NRAS]], and [[KRAS]].<ref name=Kumar20>Chapter 20 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref> Also, a [[chromosomal translocation]] specific for follicular thyroid carcinomas is one between [[paired box gene 8]] (PAX-8), a gene important in thyroid development, and the gene encoding [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ]] 1 (PPARγ1), a nuclear hormone receptor contributing to terminal differentiation of cells. The PAX8-PPARγ1 fusion is present in approximately one-third of follicular thyroid carcinomas, specifically those cancers with a t(2;3)(q13;p25) translocation, permitting juxtaposition of portions of both genes.<ref name=Kumar20/> Tumors tend carry either a RAS mutation or a PAX8-PPARγ1 fusion, and only rarely are both genetic abnormalities present in the same case.<ref name=Kumar20/> Thus, follicular thyroid carcinomas seem to arise by two distinct and virtually nonoverlapping molecular pathways.<ref name=Kumar20/>
