'''Brooke Greenberg''' (born August 1, 1993), is an American from [[Reisterstown, Maryland]], who has remained physically and cognitively similar to a [[toddler]], despite her increasing age. She is about 30 inches (76&nbsp;cm) tall, weighs about 16 pounds (7.3&nbsp;kg), and has an estimated [[mental age]] of nine months to one year. Brooke's doctors have termed her condition "Syndrome X".

==Birth and early life==
Brooke was born on August 1, 1993 to [[Jewish]]<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,538020,00.html</ref> parents Melanie and Howard Greenberg at Sinai Hospital in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], one month before her due date, weighing just four pounds (1.8&nbsp;kg). She was born with [[anterior hip dislocation]], a condition which caused her legs to be swiveled upwards toward her shoulders; this was corrected surgically.  Otherwise, 
Brooke appeared to be a normal [[infant]].<ref name="msnbc">[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9778227/ A child frozen in time]: Unexplained and unusual, 12-year-old Brooke still looks like an infant.  By Sara James, [[NBC News]], Oct. 23, 2005</ref>

In her first six years, Brooke Greenberg went through a series of unexplained [[Medical emergency|medical emergencies]] from which she recovered.  She had seven perforated [[stomach ulcers]]. She also suffered a [[seizure]]. This was followed by what was later diagnosed as a [[stroke]]; weeks later, no damage was detected. At age five, Brooke had a mass in her brain that caused her to sleep for 14 days. The doctors diagnosed the mass as a [[brain tumor]]. However, Brooke later awoke, and physicians found no tumor present. Brooke's pediatrician, Dr. Lawrence Pakula, states that the source of her sudden illness remains a mystery.<ref name="abc1"/>

During an interview on the talk show ''[[Katie (talk show)|Katie]]'', her father stated that between the ages of four and five she stopped growing.<ref>{{cite web|author=Greenfield, Beth |url=http://shine.yahoo.com/parenting/toddler-20-years-old-forever-young-due-baffling-175300753.html |title="Toddler" is 20 Years Old, and Forever Young, Due to Baffling Medical Condition |publisher=Shine.yahoo.com |date=2013-01-11 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}</ref>

==Unexplained condition==
Over the past several years, the Greenbergs visited many specialists, looking for an explanation for their daughter's strange condition, yet there has been no diagnosis of any known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality.<ref name=walker>{{Cite pmid|19428454}}</ref>  In 2001, when ''[[Dateline NBC|Dateline]]'' documented Brooke, she was still the size of a six-month-old infant, weighing just 13&nbsp;lb (5.9&nbsp;kg) at 27 inches (69&nbsp;cm) tall. The family still had no explanation. Brooke Greenberg's mother Melanie said, "They [the specialists] just said she’ll catch up. Then we went to the [[nutritionist]], the [[endocrinologist]]. We tried the [[growth hormone]]…".  The growth hormone treatment had no effect.  Howard, Brooke's father, said: "I mean she did not put on an ounce or she did not grow an inch&nbsp;… That’s when I knew there was a problem."  After the growth hormone administration failed, the doctors, unable to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]] a known condition, named her condition ''Syndrome X''.  

The Greenbergs made many visits to nearby [[Johns Hopkins Children's Center]], and even took Brooke to New York’s [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]], searching for information about their daughter’s condition.<ref name="msnbc"/> When [[geneticist]]s sequenced Greenberg's [[DNA]], they found that the [[gene]]s associated with the [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder|premature aging disease]]s were normal, unlike the [[Genetic mutation|mutated]] versions in patients with [[Werner syndrome]] and [[progeria]].<ref name="newscientist">[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17379-teenage-baby-may-lack-master-ageing-gene.html  Teenage 'baby' may lack master ageing gene], by Andy Coghlan, ''[[New Scientist]]'', June 25, 2009</ref>

== Medical studies ==

In 2006, Richard Walker, PhD in endocrine physiology of the [[University of South Florida College of Medicine]], said that Brooke's body is not developing as a coordinated unit, but as independent parts that are out of synchronization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dovepress.com/journal-editor--clinical-interventions-in-aging-eic4 |title=[[Clinical Interventions in Aging]], Editor-in-Chief |year=2009 |publisher=[[Dove Medical Press]] Ltd. |accessdate=2010-07-25 }}</ref> She has never been diagnosed with any known [[genetic disorder]] or [[chromosomal abnormality]] that would help explain why.<ref name="abc1">{{ cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Health/story?id=7880954&page=1 |title=Doctors Baffled, Intrigued by Girl Who Doesn't Age |last=Brown |first=Bob |date=2006-06-23 |work=Health |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=2009-06-27}}</ref> Her [[telomere]]s seem to be shortening at the normal rate.<ref name=walker/>

In 2009, Walker said: "There've been very minimal changes in Brooke's brain … Various parts of her body, rather than all being at the same stage, seem to be disconnected." Walker noted that Greenberg's brain, for example, is not much more mature than that of a newborn infant.  He estimates her mental age at around nine months to a year old. Brooke can make gestures and recognize sounds, but cannot speak. Her bones are like those of a  ten-year-old, and she still has her [[deciduous teeth|baby teeth]], which have an estimated developmental age of about eight years.  Said Walker, "We think that Brooke's condition presents us with a unique opportunity to understand the process of aging."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalledger.com/lifestyle/article_272631718.shtml |title=Brooke Greenberg Frozen in Time - 17-Year Old 'Toddler' |work=National Ledger |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=May 12, 2010 }}</ref> "Different parts of her body are developing at different rates, as if they were not a unit but parts of separate organisms," Walker explains.<ref name="Bethge">{{cite web  |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,725798,00.html  |author=Bethge P  |title=Brooke the Immortal.

Dr. Walker believes that the condition resulted from a failure of central control genes. He has identified two more people with similar developmental issues: Gabrielle Williams<ref>{{cite news|last=Healy|first=Donna|title=Medical Mystery: Tiny Billings girl thrives on her family's love|url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/local/tiny-billings-girl-thrives-on-her-family-s-love/article_be0ef523-aea8-5a21-8f6f-32c0e839af73.html|newspaper=Billings Gazette|date=May 22, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref>  of [[Montana]] (born 2004) and [[Nicky Freeman]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Calautti|first=Lisa|title=Forty-year-old trapped in child's body|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/newshome/6861274/forty-year-old-trapped-in-childs-body/|newspaper=The West Australian|date=February 27, 2010 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref>  of [[Australia]] (born 1970), a forty-year-old man who looks like a boy.
