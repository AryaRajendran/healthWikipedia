Rheumatic fever is a [[systemic disease]] affecting the peri-arteriolar [[connective tissue]] and can occur after an untreated Group A Beta hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal infection. It is believed to be caused by antibody [[cross-reactivity]]. This cross-reactivity is a [[Type II hypersensitivity]] reaction and is termed ''molecular mimicry.''  Usually, self reactive B cells remain anergic in the periphery without T cell co-stimulation.  During a Streptococcus infection, mature antigen presenting cells such as B cells present the bacterial antigen to CD4-T cells which differentiate into helper T<sub>2</sub> cells. Helper T<sub>2</sub> cells subsequently activate the B cells to become plasma cells and induce the production of antibodies against the cell wall of Streptococcus. However the antibodies may also react against the myocardium and joints,<ref> {{cite book | last1 = Abbas | first1 = Abul K. | last2 = Lichtman | first2 = Andrew H. | last3 = Baker | first3 = David L. | last4 = et al | title = Basic immunology: functions and disorders of the immune system | edition = 2 | publisher = Elsevier Saunders | year = 2004 | location = Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | isbn = 978-1-4160-2403-3}}</ref> producing the symptoms of rheumatic fever.

Group A ''[[streptococcus pyogenes]]'' has a [[cell wall]] composed of branched [[polymers]] which sometimes contain [[M protein (Streptococcus)|M protein]] that are highly [[antigenic]]. The antibodies which the immune system generates against the M protein  may cross react with cardiac myofiber protein [[myosin]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Faé KC, da Silva DD, Oshiro SE, ''et al.'' |title=Mimicry in recognition of cardiac myosin peptides by heart-intralesional T cell clones from rheumatic heart disease |journal=J.

However, the only proven cross reaction is with perivascular [[connective tissue]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} This inflammation occurs through direct attachment of complement and [[Fc receptor]]-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages.  Characteristic [[Aschoff body|Aschoff bodies]], composed of swollen eosinophilic collagen surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages can be seen on light microscopy.  The larger macrophages may become [[Anitschkow cell]]s or Aschoff giant cells.  Acute rheumatic valvular lesions may also involve a [[cell-mediated immunity]] reaction as these lesions predominantly contain [[T-helper]] cells and [[macrophages]].<ref name=RobbinsPath>{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |url=http://www.robbinspathology.com/ |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

In acute rheumatic fever, these lesions can be found in any layer of the heart and is hence called pancarditis.  The inflammation may cause a serofibrinous pericardial exudate described as "bread-and-butter" [[pericarditis]], which usually resolves without sequelae.  Involvement of the endocardium typically results in fibrinoid necrosis and verrucae formation along the lines of closure of the left-sided heart valves.  Warty projections arise from the deposition, while subendocardial lesions may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques.

===Rheumatic heart disease===
Chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is characterized by repeated inflammation with fibrinous resolution.  The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion, and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords.<ref name=RobbinsPath/> It is caused by an autoimmune reaction to Group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) that results in valvular damage.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=14170842|year=1964|last1=Kaplan|first1=MH|last2=Bolande|first2=R|last3=Rakita|first3=L|last4=Blair|first4=J|title=Presence of Bound Immunoglobulins and Complement in the Myocardium in Acute Rheumatic Fever.

Molecular mimicry occurs when epitopes are shared between host antigens and GAS antigens.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16455580|year=2006|last1=Guilherme|first1=L|last2=Kalil|first2=J|last3=Cunningham|first3=M|title=Molecular mimicry in the autoimmune pathogenesis of rheumatic heart disease|volume=39|issue=1|pages=31–9|doi=10.1080/08916930500484674|journal=Autoimmunity}}</ref> This causes an autoimmune reaction against native tissues in the heart that are incorrectly recognized as "foreign" due to the cross-reactivity of antibodies generated as a result of epitope sharing. The valvular endothelium is a prominent site of lymphocyte-induced damage. [[CD4]]+ T cells are the major effectors of heart tissue autoimmune reactions in RHD.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=2786783|year=1989|last1=Kemeny|first1=E|last2=Grieve|first2=T|last3=Marcus|first3=R|last4=Sareli|first4=P|last5=Zabriskie|first5=JB|title=Identification of mononuclear cells and T cell subsets in rheumatic valvulitis|volume=52|issue=2|pages=225–37|journal=Clinical immunology and immunopathology}}</ref> Normally, T cell activation is triggered by the presentation of GAS antigens.  In RHD, molecular mimicry results in incorrect T cell activation, and these T lymphocytes can go on to activate [[B cell]]s, which will begin to produce self-antigen-specific antibodies.  This leads to an immune response attack mounted against tissues in the heart that have been misidentified as pathogens.  Rheumatic valves display increased expression of [[VCAM-1]], a protein that mediates the adhesion of lymphocytes.<ref name="Roberts">{{cite journal|pmid=11133385|year=2001|last1=Roberts|first1=S|last2=Kosanke|first2=S|last3=Terrence Dunn|first3=S|last4=Jankelow|first4=D|last5=Duran|first5=CM|last6=Cunningham|first6=MW|title=Pathogenic mechanisms in rheumatic carditis: Focus on valvular endothelium|volume=183|issue=3|pages=507–11|doi=10.1086/318076|journal=The Journal of infectious diseases}}</ref> Self-antigen-specific antibodies generated via molecular mimicry between human proteins and GAS antigens up-regulate VCAM-1 after binding to the valvular endothelium.

While the mechanisms of genetic predisposition remain unclear, a few genetic factors have been found to increase susceptibility to autoimmune reactions in RHD.  The dominant contributors are a component of [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] class II molecules, found on lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells, specifically the [[HLA-DR|DR]] and [[HLA-DQ|DQ]] alleles on [[chromosome 6 (human)|human chromosome 6]].<ref name="Stanevicha">{{cite journal|pmc=333411|year=2003|last1=Stanevicha|first1=V|last2=Eglite|first2=J|last3=Sochnevs|first3=A|last4=Gardovska|first4=D|last5=Zavadska|first5=D|last6=Shantere|first6=R|title=HLA class II associations with rheumatic heart disease among clinically homogeneous patients in children in Latvia|volume=5|issue=6|pages=R340–R346|doi=10.1186/ar1000|journal=Arthritis Research & Therapy}}</ref> Certain allele combinations appear to increase RHD autoimmune susceptibility. [[Human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) class II allele DR7 ([[HLA-DR7]]) is most often associated with RHD, and its combination with certain DQ alleles is seemingly associated with the development of valvular lesions.<ref name="Stanevicha"/>  The mechanism by which MHC class II molecules increase a host's susceptibility to autoimmune reactions in RHD is unknown, but it is likely related to the role HLA molecules play in presenting antigens to T cell receptors, thus triggering an immune response.  Also found on human chromosome 6 is the cytokine [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF-α]] which is also associated with RHD.<ref name="Stanevicha" /> High expression levels of TNF-α may exacerbate valvular tissue inflammation, contributing to RHD pathogenesis.  [[Mannose-binding lectin]] (MBL) is an inflammatory protein involved in pathogen recognition.  Different variants of MBL2 gene regions are associated in RHD.  RHD-induced mitral valve stenosis has been associated with MBL2 alleles encoding for high production of MBL.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18602696|year=2008|last1=Schafranski|first1=MD|last2=Pereira Ferrari|first2=L|last3=Scherner|first3=D|last4=Torres|first4=R|last5=Jensenius|first5=JC|last6=De Messias-Reason|first6=IJ|title=High-producing MBL2 genotypes increase the risk of acute and chronic carditis in patients with history of rheumatic fever|volume=45|issue=14|pages=3827–31|doi=10.1016/j.molimm.2008.05.013|journal=Molecular immunology}}</ref> Aortic valve regurgitation in RHD patients has been associated with different MBL2 alleles that encode for low production of MBL.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2446618|year=2008|last1=Ramasawmy|first1=R|last2=Spina|first2=GS|last3=Fae|first3=KC|last4=Pereira|first4=AC|last5=Nisihara|first5=R|last6=Messias Reason|first6=IJ|last7=Grinberg|first7=M|last8=Tarasoutchi|first8=F|last9=Kalil|first9=J|title=Association of Mannose-Binding Lectin Gene Polymorphism but Not of Mannose-Binding Serine Protease 2 with Chronic Severe Aortic Regurgitation of Rheumatic Etiology|volume=15|issue=6|pages=932–936|doi=10.1128/CVI.00324-07|journal=Clinical and Vaccine Immunology : CVI}}</ref> Other genes are also being investigated to better understand the complexity of autoimmune reactions that occur in RHD.

==Prevention==
Prevention of recurrence is achieved by eradicating the acute infection and [[prophylaxis]] with antibiotics. The [[American Heart Association]] recommends that daily or monthly prophylaxis continue long-term, perhaps for life.<ref name="aha">{{cite web|title=Rheumatic Heart Disease/Rheumatic Fever|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4709|publisher=American Heart Association|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}

==Treatment==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
The management of acute rheumatic fever is geared toward the reduction of inflammation with [[anti-inflammatory medication]]s such as [[aspirin]] or [[corticosteroid]]s. Individuals with positive cultures for strep throat should also be treated with [[antibiotic]]s.
Aspirin is the drug of choice and should be given at high doses of 100&nbsp;mg/kg/day. One should watch for side effects like gastritis and [[Aspirin poisoning|salicylate poisoning]]. In children and teenagers, the use of aspirin and aspirin-containing products can be associated with [[Reye's syndrome]], a serious and potentially deadly condition. The risks, benefits and alternative treatments must always be considered when administering aspirin and aspirin-containing products in children and teenagers. Ibuprofen for pain and discomfort and corticosteroids for moderate to severe inflammatory reactions manifested by rheumatic fever should be considered in children and teenagers.
Steroids are reserved for cases where there is evidence of involvement of heart. The use of steroids may prevent further scarring of tissue and may prevent development of sequelae such as mitral stenosis.
Monthly injections of longacting penicillin must be given for a period of five years in patients having one attack of rheumatic fever. If there is evidence of carditis, the length of therapy may be up to 40 years.
Another important cornerstone in treating rheumatic fever includes the continual use of low-dose antibiotics (such as [[penicillin]], [[sulfadiazine]], or [[erythromycin]]) to prevent recurrence.

===Vaccine===
No vaccines are currently available to protect against ''S. pyogenes'' infection, although there has been research into the development of one. Difficulties in developing a vaccine include the wide variety of strains of ''S. pyogenes'' present in the environment and the large amount of time and people that will be needed for appropriate trials for safety and efficacy of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR) - Group A Streptococcus|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/soa_bacterial/en/index3.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>

===Infection===
Patients with positive cultures for ''Streptococcus pyogenes'' should be treated with penicillin as long as [[allergy]] is not present. This treatment will not alter the course of the acute disease.

The most appropriate treatment stated in the ''[[Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine]]'' for rheumatic fever is [[benzathine benzylpenicillin]].

===Inflammation===
Patients with significant symptoms may require [[corticosteroids]]. [[Salicylates]] are useful for pain.

===Heart failure===
Some patients develop significant [[carditis]] which manifests as [[congestive heart failure]]. This requires the usual treatment for heart failure: [[ACE Inhibitor]]s, [[diuretic]]s, [[beta blocker]]s, and [[digoxin]]. Unlike normal heart failure, rheumatic heart failure responds well to corticosteroids.

Rheumatic fever is common worldwide and responsible for many cases of damaged [[heart valve]]s. In Western countries, it became fairly rare since the 1960s, probably due to widespread use of antibiotics to treat [[streptococcus]] infections. While it has been far less common in the [[United States]] since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been a few outbreaks since the 1980s. Although the disease seldom occurs, it is serious and has a case-fatality rate of 2–5%.<ref>{{Cite document | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003940.htm | publisher = NLM/NIH | title = Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia | contribution = Rheumatic fever | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}.</ref>

Rheumatic fever primarily affects children between ages 5 and 17 years and occurs approximately 20 days after strep throat. In up to a third of cases, the underlying strep infection may not have caused any symptoms.

The rate of development of rheumatic fever in individuals with untreated strep infection is estimated to be 3%. The incidence of recurrence with a subsequent untreated infection is substantially greater (about 50%).<ref>{{cite book | last =Porth | first = Carol |title=Essentials of pathophysiology: concepts of altered health states | publisher =Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 | isbn= 0-7817-7087-4}}</ref> The rate of development is far lower in individuals who have received antibiotic treatment. Persons who have suffered a case of rheumatic fever have a tendency to develop flare-ups with repeated strep infections.

The recurrence of rheumatic fever is relatively common in the absence of maintenance of low dose antibiotics, especially during the first three to five years after the first episode. Heart complications may be long-term and severe, particularly if valves are involved.

Survivors of rheumatic fever often have to take penicillin to prevent streptococcal infection which could possibly lead to another case of rheumatic fever that could prove fatal.
