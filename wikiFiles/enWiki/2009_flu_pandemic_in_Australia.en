===Pacific Dawn cruise ship swine flu scare===
On 25 May, about 3 hours after going off the boat, a swine flu scare was reported on board. This shock has caused a spark in the number of cases, going up much more rapidly than before, and somehow causing "Case 1" (see above). The number of cases was around 20 before the scare, and due to this, the amount of cases have risen well over 15,000. This cruise ship caused almost half of the cases in SA, caused the WA case, and the TAS case.  Also it caused a scare in [[New Caledonia]].
