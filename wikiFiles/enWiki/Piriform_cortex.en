In [[anatomy]] of [[animal]]s, the '''piriform cortex''', or ''pyriform cortex'' is a region in the [[brain]]. 

==Anatomy and function==
The piriform cortex is part of the [[rhinencephalon]] situated in the [[telencephalon]].

In human anatomy, the "piriform lobe" has been described as consisting of the cortical [[amygdala]], [[uncus]], and anterior [[parahippocampal gyrus]].<ref name="isbn1-4160-3445-5">{{cite book |author=Estomih Mtui; Gregory Gruener |title=Clinical Neuroanatomy and Neuroscience: With STUDENT CONSULT Online Access |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2006 |pages=368 |isbn=1-4160-3445-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The function of the piriform cortex relates to [[olfaction]], which is the perception of [[odor|smell]]s.

==Phylogeny==
Sometimes called the ''olfactory cortex'', ''olfactory lobe'' or ''paleopallium'', piriform cortical regions are present in the brains of [[amphibians]], [[reptile]]s and [[mammal]]s.

The piriform cortex is among three areas that emerge in the [[telencephalon]] of amphibians, situated [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudally]] to a dorsal area, which is caudal to a hippocampal area. Farther along the [[phylogeny|phylogenic timeline]], the telencephalic bulb of reptiles as viewed in a cross section of the transverse plane extends with the [[archipallium|archipallial]] hippocampus folding toward the midline and down as the dorsal area begins to form a recognizable cortex. 

As mammalian cerebrums developed, volume of the dorsal cortex increased in slightly greater proportion, as compared proportionally with increased overall brain volume, until it enveloped the [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] regions. Recognized as [[neopallium]] or [[neocortex]], enlarged dorsal areas envelop the [[paleopallium|paleopallial]] piriform cortex in [[human]]s and [[Old World monkey]]s.

Among [[scientific classification|taxonomic groupings]] of mammals, the piriform cortex and the [[olfactory bulb]] become proportionally smaller in the brains of [[phylogeny|phylogenically]] younger species. The piriform cortex occupies a greater proportion of the overall brain and of the telencephalic brains of [[insectivore]]s than in [[primate]]s. The piriform cortex continues to occupy a consistent albeit small and declining proportion of the increasingly large [[telencephalon]] in the most recent primate species while the volume of the olfactory bulb becomes less in proportion.

==Role in epilepsy==
The piriform cortex contains a critical, functionally defined epileptogenic trigger zone, "Area Tempestas".  From this site in piriform cortex chemical and electrically evoked seizures can be triggered.  It is the necessary site for the proconvulsant action of chemoconvulsants.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Löscher W, Ebert U |title=The role of the piriform cortex in kindling |journal=Prog.
