'''''Staphylococcus aureus''''' is a [[bacterium]] that is a member of the [[Firmicutes]], and is frequently found in the human respiratory tract and on the skin. Although ''S. aureus'' is not always [[Pathogen|pathogenic]], it is a common cause of skin infections (e.g. [[boils]]), respiratory disease (e.g. [[sinusitis]]), and [[food poisoning]]. Disease-associated strains often promote infections by producing potent protein [[Exotoxin|toxins]], and expressing cell-surface proteins that [[Protein A|bind and inactivate antibodies]]. The emergence of [[antibiotic-resistant]] forms of pathogenic ''S. aureus'' (e.g. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine.

'''''Staphylococcus''''' was first identified in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]] (1880) by the [[surgeon]] Sir [[Alexander Ogston]] in [[pus]] from a surgical abscess in a knee joint.<ref name="RevInfectDis-ogston-1984">{{cite journal | author=Ogston A | title="On Abscesses".

''S. aureus'' can cause a range of illnesses, from minor skin [[infection]]s, such as [[pimple]]s, [[impetigo]], [[boil]]s (furuncles), [[cellulitis]] folliculitis, [[carbuncle]]s, [[scalded skin syndrome]], and [[abscess]]es, to life-threatening diseases such as [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]], [[osteomyelitis]], [[endocarditis]], [[toxic shock syndrome]] (TSS), [[bacteremia]], and [[sepsis]]. Its incidence ranges from skin, soft tissue, respiratory, bone, joint, endovascular to [[wound infection]]s. It is still one of the five most common causes of [[nosocomial infection]]s and is often the cause of postsurgical wound infections. Each year, some 500,000 patients in American hospitals contract a staphylococcal infection.<ref name=NIH>{{cite news | last=Bowersox | first=John | url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/1999/staph.htm | title=Experimental Staph Vaccine Broadly Protective in Animal Studies | publisher=NIH | date=27 May 1999 | accessdate=28 July 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070505050641/http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/1999/staph.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 5 May 2007}}</ref>

''S. aureus'' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|s|t|æ|f|ɨ|l|ɵ|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|ə|s|_|ˈ|ɔr|i|ə|s}}, [[Greek language|Greek]] ''σταφυλόκοκκος'', "grape-cluster berry", [[Latin]] aureus, "golden") is a [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobic]] [[Gram-positive]] [[coccus|coccal]] [[bacterium]], also known as "golden staph" and Oro staphira.  <br>In medical literature the bacteria is often referred to as ''S. aureus'' or ''Staph aureus''.   ''Staphylococcus'' should not be confused with the similarly named and medically relevant [[genus]] ''[[Streptococcus]]''.
''S. aureus''  appears as [[grape]]-like clusters when viewed through a microscope, and has large, round, golden-yellow colonies, often with [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|hemolysis]], when grown on [[Agar plate|blood agar plate]]s.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn= 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> ''S. aureus'' reproduces [[asexually]] by [[binary fission]]. The two daughter cells do not fully separate and remain attached to one another. This is why the cells are observed in clusters.<ref>"[http://www.freewebs.com/palexander13/reproduction.htm ''Staphylococcus aureus'': Reproduction]". palexander13.webs.com.</ref>

''S. aureus'' is [[catalase]]-positive (meaning it can produce the enzyme catalase), so is able to convert [[hydrogen peroxide]] ({{chem|H|2|O|2}}) to water and oxygen. This test is sometimes used to distinguish staphylococci from [[Enterococcus|enterococci]] and [[Streptococcus|streptococci]].  Previously ''S. aureus'' was differentiated from  other staphylococci by the [[coagulase|coagulase test]]. However it is now known that not all ''S. aureus'' are coagulase positive<ref name=Sherris /><ref>PreTest, Surgery, 12th ed., p.88</ref> and that incorrect species identification can impact effective treatment and control measures.<ref name="CNSA">{{cite journal | author=Matthews KR, Roberson J, Gillespie BE, Luther DA, Oliver SP | title=Identification and Differentiation of Coagulase-Negative ''Staphylococcus aureus'' by Polymerase Chain Reaction | journal=Journal of Food Protection | year=1997 | pages=686–8 | volume=60 | issue=6 |url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iafp/jfp/1997/00000060/00000006/art00015 }}</ref>

== Role in disease ==
[[Image:MRSA7820.jpg|thumb|250px|SEM of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''.]]

''S. aureus'' is responsible for many infections but it may also occur as a  [[commensal]]. The presence of S. aureus does  not always indicate infection. 
S. aureus can survive from hours to weeks, or even months, on dry environmental surfaces, depending on strain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cimolai N |title=MRSA and the environment: implications for comprehensive control measures |journal=Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=481–93 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18273652 |doi=10.1007/s10096-008-0471-0 }}</ref> 

''S. aureus'' can infect  tissues when the skin or mucosal barriers have been breached. This can lead to many different types of infections including [[furuncle]]s  and [[carbuncle]]s (a collection of furuncles). In infants, ''S. aureus'' infection can cause a severe disease — [[staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome]] (SSSS).<ref name="Pediatrics1980-Curran">{{cite journal | author=Curran JP, Al-Salihi FL | title=Neonatal staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome: massive outbreak due to an unusual phage type | journal=Pediatrics | year=1980 | pages=285–90 | volume=66 | issue=2 | pmid=6447271 | url=http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/curran1/ }}</ref>

''S. aureus'' infections can spread through contact with pus from an infected wound, skin-to-skin contact with an infected person by producing [[hyaluronidase]] that destroys tissues, and contact with objects such as towels, sheets, clothing, or athletic equipment used by an infected person. Deeply penetrating ''S. aureus'' infections can be severe. Prosthetic joints put a person at particular risk of [[septic arthritis]], and staphylococcal [[endocarditis]] (infection of the heart valves) and [[pneumonia]].
''S. aureus'' can host [[phage]]s, such as [[Panton-Valentine leukocidin]], that increase its virulence.

=== Atopic dermatitis ===
''S. aureus'' is extremely prevalent in [[atopic dermatitis]] patients. It is mostly found in fertile, active places, including the armpits, hair, and scalp.  Large pimples that appear in those areas may exacerbate the infection if lacerated. This can lead to [[staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome]] (SSSS). A severe form of this, [[Ritter's disease]], can be observed in neonates.

===Animal infections===
''S. aureus'' can survive on dogs, cats, and horses,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and can cause [[bumblefoot (infection)|bumblefoot]] in chickens{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}.
''S. aureus'' is one of the causal agents of [[mastitis]] in dairy [[cow]]s. Its large [[polysaccharide]] capsule protects the organism from recognition by the cow's immune defenses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cenci-Goga BT, Karama M, Rossitto PV, Morgante RA, Cullor JS |title=Enterotoxin production by ''Staphylococcus aureus'' isolated from mastitic cows |journal=Journal of food protection |volume=66 |issue=9 |pages=1693–6 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=14503727 }}</ref>

== Virulence factors ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2012}}

=== Enzymes ===
<ref>Medical Laboratory Manual For Tropical Countries vol two</ref>
It produces various enzymes such as [[coagulase]] (bound and free coagulases) which clots plasma and coats the bacterial cell which probably prevent [[phagocytosis]].
[[Hyaluronidase]] also known as spreading factor that breakdown hyaluronic acid and help in spreading of ''Staphylococcus aureus''.
''S.aureus'' also produces DNAse ([[deoxyribonuclease]]) which breakdown the DNA.

=== Toxins ===

Depending on the strain, ''S. aureus'' is capable of secreting several [[exotoxins]], which can be categorized into three groups.  Many of these toxins are associated with specific diseases.

;Superantigens
:(PTSAgs) have [[superantigen]] activities that induce [[toxic shock syndrome]] (TSS).  This group includes the toxin TSST-1, which causes TSS associated with [[tampon]] use.  This is characterized by fever, erythematous rash, hypotension, shock, multiple organ failure, and skin [[desquamation]].  Lack of antibody to TSST-1 plays a part in the pathogenesis of toxic shock syndrome.       Other strains of ''S. aureus'' can produce an [[enterotoxin]] that is the causative agent of ''S. aureus'' gastroenteritis. This gastroenteritis is self-limiting, characterized by vomiting and diarrhea one to six hours after ingestion of the toxin with recovery in eight to 24 hours. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and major abdominal pain.

;Exfoliative toxins
: EF toxins are implicated in the disease staphylococcal [[scalded-skin syndrome]] (SSSS), which occurs most commonly in infants and young children. It also may occur as epidemics in hospital nurseries. The [[protease]] activity of the exfoliative toxins causes peeling of the skin observed with SSSS.

;Other toxins
: Staphylococcal toxins that act on cell membranes include [[Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin|alpha toxin]], [[Staphylococcus aureus beta toxin|beta toxin]], [[Staphylococcus aureus delta toxin|delta toxin]], and several bicomponent toxins.  The bicomponent toxin [[Panton-Valentine leukocidin]] (PVL) is associated with severe necrotizing pneumonia in children.  The genes encoding the components of PVL are encoded on a [[bacteriophage]] found in community-associated [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''S. aureus'']] (MRSA) strains.

=== Other immunoevasive strategies ===

;Protein A 

[[Protein A]] is anchored to staphylococcal [[peptidoglycan]] pentaglycine bridges (chains of five [[glycine]] residues) by the [[Peptidyl transferase|transpeptidase]] [[sortase]] A.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schneewind O, Fowler A, Faull KF |title=Structure of the cell wall anchor of surface proteins in Staphylococcus aureus |journal=Science |volume=268 |issue=5207 |pages=103–6 |year=1995 |month=April |pmid=7701329 |doi=10.1126/science.7701329|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7701329}}</ref>  Protein A, an [[IgG]]-binding protein, binds to the [[Fc region]] of an [[antibody]].  In fact, studies involving mutation of genes coding for protein A resulted in a lowered virulence of ''S. aureus'' as measured by survival in blood, which has led to speculation that protein A-contributed virulence requires binding of antibody Fc regions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patel AH, Nowlan P, Weavers ED, Foster T |title=Virulence of protein A-deficient and alpha-toxin-deficient mutants of Staphylococcus aureus isolated by allele replacement |journal=Infect. Immun. |volume=55 |issue=12 |pages=3103–10 |year=1987 |month=December |pmid=3679545 |pmc=260034 |url=http://iai.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3679545}}</ref> 

Protein A in various recombinant forms has been used for decades to bind and purify a wide range of antibodies by [[immunoaffinity chromatography]].  Transpeptidases, such as the sortases responsible for anchoring factors like Protein A to the staphylococcal peptidoglycan, are being studied in hopes of developing new antibiotics to target [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] infections.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhu J |title=Single mutation on the surface of Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A can disrupt its dimerization |journal=Biochemistry |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=1667–74 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18193895 |doi=10.1021/bi7014597 |author-separator=, |author2=Lu C |author3=Standland M |display-authors=3 |last4=Lai |first4=Eric |last5=Moreno |first5=Gabrielle N. |last6=Umeda |first6=Aiko |last7=Jia |first7=Xudong |last8=Zhang |first8=Zhiwen}}</ref>

[[File:Staphylococcus aureus on TSA.jpg|thumb|''Staphylococcus aureus'' on Tryptic Soy Agar.  The strain is producing a yellow pigment [[Staphyloxanthin|staphyloxanthin]]. ]]

;Staphylococcal Pigments

Some strains of ''S. aureus'' are capable of producing [[staphyloxanthin]] — a golden coloured [[carotenoid]] [[pigment]].  This pigment acts as a [[virulence factor]], primarily by being a bacterial [[antioxidant]] which helps the microbe evade the [[reactive oxygen species]] which the host immune system uses to kill pathogens.<ref name="staphylotoxin">{{cite journal |author=Clauditz A, Resch A, Wieland KP, Peschel A, Götz F |title=Staphyloxanthin plays a role in the fitness of Staphylococcus aureus and its ability to cope with oxidative stress |journal=Infection and immunity |volume=74 |issue=8 |pages=4950–3 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16861688 |pmc=1539600 |doi=10.1128/IAI.00204-06 |url=http://iai.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16861688}}</ref><ref name="JExpMed2005-Liu">{{cite journal | author=Liu GY, Essex A, Buchanan JT, Datta V, Hoffman HM, Bastian JF, Fierer J, Nizet V | title=Staphylococcus aureus golden pigment impairs neutrophil killing and promotes virulence through its antioxidant activity | journal=J Exp Med | year=2005 | pages=209–15 | volume=202 | issue=2 | pmid=16009720 | url=http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/202/2/209 | doi=10.1084/jem.20050846 | pmc=2213009}}</ref> 

Mutant strains of ''S. aureus'' modified to lack staphyloxanthin are less likely to survive incubation with an oxidizing chemical, such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] than pigmented strains. Mutant colonies are quickly killed when exposed to human [[Neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]], while many of the pigmented colonies survive. In mice, the pigmented strains cause lingering [[abscess]]es when inoculated into wounds, whereas wounds infected with the unpigmented strains quickly heal.

These tests suggest the Staphylococcus strains use staphyloxanthin as a defence against the normal human immune system.  Drugs designed to inhibit the production of staphyloxanthin may weaken the bacterium and renew its susceptibility to antibiotics.<ref name="JExpMed2005-Liu"/>  In fact, because of similarities in the pathways for biosynthesis of staphyloxanthin and human [[cholesterol]], a drug developed in the context of cholesterol-lowering therapy was shown to block ''S. aureus'' pigmentation and disease progression in a [[mouse model|mouse infection model]].<ref name="Science2008-Liu">{{cite journal | author=Liu CI, Liu GY, Song Y, Yin F, Hensler ME, Jeng WY, Nizet V, Wang AH, Oldfield E | title=A cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor blocks Staphylococcus aureus virulence | journal=Science | year=2008 | pages=391–94 | volume=319| pmid=18276850 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/319/5868/1391 | doi=10.1126/science.1153018 | issue=5868 | pmc=2747771}}</ref>

== Classical diagnosis ==
[[File:Staph sputum.JPG|thumb|250px|Typical Gram-positive cocci, in clusters, from a sputum sample, Gram stain]]

Depending upon the type of infection present, an appropriate specimen is obtained accordingly and sent to the laboratory for definitive identification by using biochemical or enzyme-based tests. A [[Gram stain]] is first performed to guide the way, which should show typical [[Gram-positive]] bacteria, cocci, in clusters. Second, the isolate is cultured on [[mannitol salt agar]], which is a selective medium with 7–9% [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] that allows ''S. aureus'' to grow, producing yellow-colored colonies as a result of [[mannitol]] fermentation and subsequent drop in the medium's [[pH]]. 

Furthermore, for differentiation on the species level, [[catalase]] (positive for all ''Staphylococcus'' species), [[coagulase]] ([[fibrin]] clot formation, positive for ''S. aureus''), [[DNAse]] (zone of clearance on DNase agar), [[lipase]] (a yellow color and rancid odor smell), and [[phosphatase]] (a pink color) tests are all done. For staphylococcal food poisoning, phage typing can be performed to determine whether the staphylococci recovered from the food were the source of infection.

=== Rapid diagnosis and typing ===

[[Medical laboratory|Diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories]] are key for identifying outbreaks and new strains of ''S. aureus''. Recent genetic advances have enabled reliable and rapid techniques for the identification and characterization of clinical isolates of ''S. aureus'' in real time. These tools support infection control strategies to limit bacterial spread and ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics. [[Real-time PCR]] is being increasingly  employed in clinical laboratories as a technique to identifying outbreaks.<ref name= FrancoisP >{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/staph|author= Francois P and Schrenzel J|year=2008|chapter=Rapid Diagnosis and Typing of Staphylococcus aureus|title=StaphylococcuWEINERs: Molecular Genetics|publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-29-5}}</ref><ref name=Mackay>{{cite book | editor = Mackay IM | title = Real-Time PCR in Microbiology: From Diagnosis to Characterization | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-904455-18-9}}</ref>

== Treatment and antibiotic resistance ==

The treatment of choice for ''S. aureus'' infection is [[penicillin]]; in most countries, though, penicillin resistance is extremely common, and first-line therapy is most commonly a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotic (for example, [[oxacillin]] or [[flucloxacillin]]).  Combination therapy with [[gentamicin]] may be used to treat serious infections, such as [[infective endocarditis|endocarditis]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Korzeniowski O, Sande MA|title=Combination antimicrobial therapy for ''Staphylococcus aureus'' endocarditis in patients addicted to parenteral drugs and in nonaddicts: a prospective study|journal=Ann Intern Med|year=1982|volume=97|pmid=6751182|issue=4|pages=496–503}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Bayer AS|title=Diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis and its complications|journal=Circulation|year=1998|volume=98|issue=25|pages=2936–48|pmid=9860802|author-separator=,|author2=Bolger AF|author3=Taubert KA|display-authors=3|last4=Wilson|first4=W|last5=Steckelberg|first5=J|last6=Karchmer|first6=AW|last7=Levison|first7=M|last8=Chambers|first8=HF|last9=Dajani|first9=AS}}</ref> but its use is controversial because of the high risk of damage to the kidneys.<ref>{{cite journal

Antibiotic resistance in ''S. aureus'' was uncommon when penicillin was first introduced in 1943. Indeed, the original petri dish on which [[Alexander Fleming]] of [[Imperial College London]] observed the antibacterial activity of the ''[[Penicillium notatum|Penicillium]]'' fungus was growing a culture of ''S. aureus''. By 1950, 40% of hospital ''S. aureus'' isolates were penicillin-resistant; and, by 1960, this had risen to 80%.<ref name="EmergInfectDis2001-Chambers">{{cite journal | author=Chambers HF | title=The changing epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus? | journal=Emerg Infect Dis | year=2001 | pages=178–82 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pmid=11294701 | url= http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/chambers.htm | doi=10.3201/eid0702.010204 | pmc=2631711}}</ref>

[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''S. aureus'']], abbreviated '''MRSA''' and often pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɜr|s|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ɛ|m|_|ɑː|_|ɛ|s|_|eɪ}}, is one of a number of greatly feared strains of ''S. aureus'' which have become resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics. MRSA strains are most often found associated with institutions such as hospitals, but are becoming increasingly prevalent in community-acquired infections. A recent study by the [[Translational Genomics Research Institute]] showed that nearly half (47%) of the [[meat]] and [[poultry]] in [[U.S.]] grocery stores were contaminated with ''S. aureus'', with more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics.<ref>{{cite web |title=US Meat and Poultry Is Widely Contaminated With Drug-Resistant Staph Bacteria |date=15 April 2011 |publisher=ScienceDaily |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110415083153.htm}}</ref>

=== Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance ===
[[Image:Staphylococcus aureus, 50,000x, USDA, ARS, EMU.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bacterial cells of ''Staphylococcus aureus'', which is one of the causal agents of mastitis in dairy cows. Its large capsule protects the organism from attack by the cow's immunological defenses.]]
Staphylococcal resistance to penicillin is mediated by [[penicillinase]] (a form of [[beta-lactamase|β-lactamase]]) production: an enzyme that cleaves the [[β-lactam]] ring of the penicillin molecule, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. Penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotics, such as [[methicillin]], [[nafcillin]], oxacillin, [[cloxacillin]], [[dicloxacillin]], and flucloxacillin, are able to resist degradation by staphylococcal penicillinase.

Resistance to methicillin is mediated via the ''mec'' [[operon]], part of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCC''mec''). Resistance is conferred by the ''mecA'' gene, which codes for an altered [[penicillin-binding protein]] (PBP2a or PBP2') that has a lower affinity for binding β-lactams (penicillins, [[cephalosporin]]s, and [[carbapenem]]s). This allows for resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics, and obviates their clinical use during MRSA infections. As such, the [[glycopeptide]] [[vancomycin]] is often deployed against MRSA.

[[Aminoglycoside]] antibiotics, such as [[kanamycin]], [[gentamicin]], [[streptomycin]], etc., were once effective against staphylococcal infections until strains evolved mechanisms to inhibit the aminoglycosides' action, which occurs via protonated amine and/or hydroxyl interactions with the [[ribosomal RNA]] of the bacterial [[30S ribosomal subunit]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carter AP, Clemons WM, Brodersen DE, Morgan-Warren RJ, Wimberly BT, Ramakrishnan V |title=Functional insights from the structure of the 30S ribosomal subunit and its interactions with antibiotics |journal=Nature |volume=407 |issue=6802 |pages=340–8 |year=2000 |month=September |pmid=11014183 |doi=10.1038/35030019 }}</ref>  There are three main mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms which are currently and widely accepted: aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, ribosomal mutations, and active [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] of the drug out of the bacteria.

Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes inactivate the aminoglycoside by covalently attaching either a [[phosphate]], [[nucleotide]], or [[acetyl]] moiety to either the amine or the alcohol key functional group (or both groups) of the antibiotic.  This changes the charge or sterically hinders the antibiotic, decreasing its ribosomal binding affinity.  In ''S. aureus'', the best-characterized aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme is aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase 4' IA (''ANT(4')IA'').  This enzyme has been solved by [[x-ray crystallography]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sakon J, Liao HH, Kanikula AM, Benning MM, Rayment I, Holden HM |title=Molecular structure of kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase determined to 3.0-A resolution |journal=Biochemistry |volume=32 |issue=45 |pages=11977–84 |year=1993 |month=November |pmid=8218273 |doi= 10.1021/bi00096a006}}</ref>  The enzyme is able to attach an [[adenine|adenyl]] moiety to the 4' hydroxyl group of many aminoglycosides, including kamamycin and gentamicin.

Glycopeptide resistance is mediated by acquisition of the ''vanA'' gene.  The ''vanA'' gene originates from the ''[[Enterococcus|enterococci]]'' and codes for an enzyme that produces an alternative [[peptidoglycan]] to which [[vancomycin]] will not bind.

Today, ''S. aureus'' has become [[antibiotic resistance|resistant]] to many commonly used antibiotics.  In the UK, only 2% of all ''S. aureus'' isolates are sensitive to penicillin, with a similar picture in the rest of the world. The β-lactamase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, and flucloxacillin) were developed to treat penicillin-resistant ''S. aureus'', and are still used as first-line treatment.  Methicillin was the first antibiotic in this class to be used (it was introduced in 1959), but, only two years later, the first case of MRSA was reported in England.<ref name="BMJ1961-Jevons">{{cite journal | author=Jevons MP | title=Celbenin-resistant staphylococci | journal=BMJ | volume=1 | year=1961 | pages=124–5 | doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5219.124-a | issue=5219}}</ref>

Despite this, MRSA generally remained an uncommon finding, even in hospital settings, until the 1990s, when there was an explosion in MRSA prevalence in hospitals, where it is now [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]].<ref name="JAntimicrobChemother2001-Johnson">{{cite journal | author=Johnson AP, Aucken HM, Cavendish S, Ganner M, Wale MC, Warner M, Livermore DM, Cookson BD | title=Dominance of EMRSA-15 and -16 among MRSA causing nosocomial bacteraemia in the UK: analysis of isolates from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) | journal=J Antimicrob Chemother | year=2001 | pages=143–4 | volume=48 | issue=1 | pmid=11418528 |url = http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/48/1/143  | doi=10.1093/jac/48.1.143}}</ref>

MRSA infections in both the hospital and community setting are commonly treated with non-β-lactam antibiotics, such as [[clindamycin]] (a lincosamine) and co-trimoxazole (also commonly known as [[trimethoprim]]/[[sulfamethoxazole]]).  Resistance to these antibiotics has also led to the use of new, broad-spectrum anti-Gram-positive antibiotics, such as [[linezolid]], because of its availability as an oral drug. First-line treatment for serious invasive infections due to MRSA is currently [[glycopeptide]] antibiotics ([[vancomycin]] and [[teicoplanin]]).  There are number of problems with these antibiotics, such as the need for intravenous administration (there is no oral preparation available), toxicity, and the need to monitor drug levels regularly by blood tests.  There are also concerns glycopeptide antibiotics do not penetrate very well into infected tissues (this is a particular concern with infections of the brain and [[meninges]] and in [[endocarditis]]).  Glycopeptides must not be used to treat methicillin-sensitive ''S. aureus'' (MSSA), as outcomes are inferior.<ref name="ArchInternMed2002-Blot">{{verification needed|date=October 2011}}{{cite journal | author=Blot SI, Vandewoude KH, Hoste EA, Colardyn FA | title=Outcome and attributable mortality in critically Ill patients with bacteremia involving methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' | journal=Arch Intern Med | year=2002 | pages=22293–5 | volume=162 | issue=19 | pmid=12390067 | url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/162/19/2229  | doi=10.1001/archinte.162.19.2229}}</ref>

Because of the high level of resistance to penicillins and because of the potential for MRSA to develop resistance to vancomycin, the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has published [http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0039349/m0039349.asp guidelines] for the appropriate use of vancomycin. In situations where the incidence of MRSA infections is known to be high, the attending physician may choose to use a glycopeptide [[antibiotic]] until the identity of the infecting organism is known.  After the infection is confirmed to be due to a methicillin-susceptible strain of ''S. aureus'', treatment can be changed to [[flucloxacillin]] or even [[penicillin]], as appropriate.

[[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'']] (VRSA) is a strain of ''S. aureus'' that has become resistant to the glycopeptides.
The first case of vancomycin-intermediate ''S. aureus'' (VISA) was reported in Japan in 1996;<ref name="JAntimicrobChemother1997-Hiramatsu">{{cite journal | author=Hiramatsu K, Hanaki H, Ino T, Yabuta K, Oguri T, Tenover FC | title=Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' clinical strain with reduced vancomycin susceptibility | journal=J Antimicrob Chemother | year=1997 | pages=135–6 | volume=40 | issue=1 | pmid=9249217 | url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/40/1/135.pdf | doi=10.1093/jac/40.1.135}}</ref>

== Carriage of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ==

The carriage of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' is an important source of nosocomial infection and community-acquired methicillin-resistant ''S. aureus'' (MRSA).  Although ''S. aureus'' can be present on the skin of the host, a large proportion of its carriage is through the anterior nares of the nasal passages. <ref name="pmid9227864"/> The ability of the nasal passages to harbour  ''S. aureus'' results from a combination of a weakened or defective host immunity and the bacteria's  ability to evade host innate immunity. <ref name="PMC2265977">{{cite journal |author=Quinn, G. A.; Cole, A. M|title=Suppression of innate immunity by a nasal carriage strain of Staphylococcus aureus increases its colonization on nasal epithelium|journal= Immunology  |volume=122 |issue=1 |pages=80–9 |year=2007 |month=September |pmc=2265977 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02615.x}}</ref><br>

== Infection control ==

Spread of ''S. aureus'' (including MRSA) generally is through human-to-human contact, although recently some veterinarians have discovered the infection can be spread through pets,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sing A, Tuschak C, Hoermansdorfer S |title=Methicillin-Resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' in a Family and Its Pet Cat |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=358 |pages=1200–1 |year=2008 |month=March |doi=10.1056/NEJMc0706805}}</ref> with environmental contamination thought to play a relatively unimportant part.  Emphasis on basic [[hand washing]] techniques are, therefore, effective in preventing its transmission. The use of disposable aprons and gloves by staff reduces skin-to-skin contact and, therefore, further reduces the risk of transmission.  Please refer to the article on [[infection control]] for further details.

Recently, there have been myriad reported cases of ''S. aureus'' in hospitals across America. The pathogen has had facilitated transportation in medical facilities mainly because of insufficient healthcare worker hygiene. ''S. aureus'' is an incredibly hardy bacterium, as was shown in a study where it survived on polyester for just under three months;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Neely AN, Maley MP |title=Survival of enterococci and staphylococci on hospital fabrics and plastic |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=724–6 |year=2000 |month=February |pmid=10655374 |pmc=86187 |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10655374}}</ref> polyester is the main material used in hospital privacy curtains.

The bacteria are transported on the hands of healthcare workers, who may pick them up from a seemingly healthy patient carrying a benign or commensal strain of ''S. aureus'', and then pass it on to the next patient being treated.  Introduction of the bacteria into the bloodstream can lead to various complications, including, but not limited to, endocarditis, meningitis, and, if it is widespread, [[sepsis]].

[[Ethanol]] has proven to be an effective topical sanitizer against MRSA. [[Quaternary ammonium]] can be used in conjunction with ethanol to increase the duration of the sanitizing action. The prevention of [[nosocomial infection]]s involves routine and [[terminal cleaning]]. Nonflammable alcohol vapor in {{chem|link=carbon dioxide|CO|2}} [[NAV-CO2]] systems have an advantage, as they do not attack metals or plastics used in medical environments, and do not contribute to antibacterial resistance.

An important and previously unrecognized means of community-associated MRSA colonization and transmission is during sexual contact.<ref name="CDI2007">{{cite journal |author=Cook H, Furuya E, Larson E, Vasquez G, Lowy F |title=Heterosexual transmission of community-associated methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=Clin Infect Dis |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=410–3 |year=2007 |pmid=17205449 | url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?CID40836 |doi=10.1086/510681}}</ref>

Staff or patients who are found to carry resistant strains of ''S. aureus'' may be required to undergo "eradication therapy", which may include antiseptic washes and shampoos (such as [[chlorhexidine]]) and application of topical antibiotic ointments (such as [[mupirocin]] or [[neomycin]]) to the anterior [[nares]] of the nose.

S. aureus is killed in 1 minute at 78 °C and 10 minutes at 64 °C<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shafiei Y, Razavilar V, Javadi A |title=Thermal Death Time of ''Staphylococcus Aureus'' (PTCC=29213) and ''Staphylococcus Epidermidis'' (PTCC=1435) in Distilled Water |journal=Australian Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=1551–4 |year=2011 |url=http://www.ajbasweb.com/ajbas/2011/November-2011/1551-1554.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

The nonprotein amino acid L-homoarginine is a growth inhibitor of ''S. aureus'' as well as ''[[Candida albicans]]''. It is assumed to be an [[antimetabolite]] of [[arginine]].

Biological control might be a new possible way to control ''Staphylococcus aureus'' in body surfaces. Colonization of body surfaces (especially in the nose) by [[Staphylococcus epidermidis]](inhibitory strain JK16) impairs the establishment of S. aureus.

A 2011 study<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Nature|date=20 May 2010|volume=465|doi=10.1038/nature09074|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/16749867/484766515/name/Staphylococcus+epidermidis+Esp+inhibits+Staphylococcus.pdf|issue=7296|pmid=20485435|title=Staphylococcus epidermidis Esp inhibits ''Staphylococcus aureus'' biofilm formation and nasal colonization|last1=Iwase|first1=Tadayuki|last2=Uehara|first2=Yoshio|last3=Shinji|first3=Hitomi|last4=Tajima|first4=Akiko|last5=Seo|first5=Hiromi|last6=Takada|first6=Koji|last7=Agata|first7=Toshihiko|last8=Mizunoe|first8=Yoshimitsu|pages=346–9}}</ref> points to this new possible way to control S.aureus. This study was performed from observations of the nasal microbial flora of a diverse group of people. It was discovered that there are two different strains of S. epidermidis, one that inhibits biofilm formation by S. aureus, S. epidermidis strain JK16 (inhibitory type), and one that does not (non-inhibitory type) S. epidermidis strain JK11. In this study they observed that there were some patients that were not affected by ''Staphylococcus aureus''; this was because these patients had S. aureus together with S. epidermis (inhibitory type), in their nasal microbial flora. This is due to an amensalistic relationship between these microorganisms, the inhibitory strain of ''S. epidermidis'' and ''Staphylococcus aureus''.

These findings open the way to a biological control therapy to help in the treatment of S. aureus infections which are becoming a growing threat due to the rise of resistance to conventional antibiotic treatments.
