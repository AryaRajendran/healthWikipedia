A '''phytobezoar''' is a type of [[bezoar]], or trapped mass in the stomach, that consists of components of indigestible plant material, such as fibres, skins and seeds. While phytobezoars may be discovered incidentally on [[upper gastrointestinal series|barium x-ray]] or [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|endoscopic]] testing of the stomach, individuals with phytobezoars may develop symptoms: nausea, vomiting, [[gastric outlet obstruction]], perforation, abdominal pain, and [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding|bleeding]] have been reported.<ref name=Chisholm>{{cite pmid|1416706}}</ref> Conditions that lead to decreased motility in the stomach ([[gastroparesis]]) and surgeries on the stomach (such as [[vagotomy]] or [[gastric bypass]]) are associated with the development of phytobezoars.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite pmid|9845563}}</ref>  A specific type of phytobezoar, termed a '''diospyrobezoar''', is associated with ingestion of unripe [[persimmon]]s, which contain a soluble [[tannin]] called shibuol that polymerizes into a coagulative cellulose-protein compound in the acid environment of the stomach, to form the bezoar.<ref name=Zhang>{{cite pmid|18176981}}</ref>  In addition to their presence in human stomachs, phytobezoars have been documented in the stomachs of slaughtered plant-eating animals.<ref name=Chisholm />

Several treatments for phytobezoars have been described. [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|Endoscopy]] involves using a fibre-optic flexible camera to identify the phytobezoar, that can be evacuated from the stomach using various assisted devices (such as [[Roth basket]]s, snares, or Dormia baskets).<ref name=Chisholm/><ref name=Zhang/> If the phytobezoar cannot be removed due to size, [[electrohydraulic lithotripsy]], mechanical lithotripsy, snares, or [[Nd:YAG laser]] therapy may be used to fragment the mass.<ref name=Zhang/> [[Papain]] (meat tenderizer) and [[cellulase]] enzymes have been used to help reduce the size of phytobezoars.<ref name=Zhang/> [[Coca-Cola]] ingestion has been found to be particularly useful to decrease the size of diospyrobezoars.<ref name=Zhang/> When all other measures have failed, surgical [[gastrotomy]] is required to evacuate the bezoar.<ref name=Zhang/>
