'''Rheum''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|r|uː|m}}; from [[Greek language|Greek]]: [[wikt:ῥεῦμα|ῥεῦμα]], ''rheuma'', a flowing, rheum) is thin mucus naturally discharged as a watery substance from the [[Human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]] or [[mouth]] during sleep (cf. [[mucopurulent discharge]]).<ref>{{cite dictionary | title=Rheum (discharge)  | url=http://www.memidex.com/rheum+discharge | encyclopedia=Memidex Dictionary/Thesaurus | date=2009 | accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref><ref name="amodio families.com">Amodio, Aimee.[http://health.families.com/blog/where-do-eye-boogers-come-from "Where Do Eye Boogers Come From?"], Families.com blog</ref><ref name=hiskey>Hiskey, Daven.

Rheum from the eyes is particularly common.  Dried rheum is in common usage called '''eye gunk''', '''sleepydust''', '''sleep''', '''sleepys''', '''sleepers''', '''eye goop''', '''eye crud''', '''eye jelly''','''eye crust''', '''eye bogeys''', '''eye boogers''', '''eye-sand''', etc<ref name="amodio families.com" /><ref name=hiskey /> (An obsolete term for this dried rheum is ''gound''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920687-2}}</ref> )

In the waking individual, blinking of the eyelid causes rheum to be washed away with tears via the [[nasolacrimal duct]]. The absence of this action during sleep, however, results in a small amount of dry rheum accumulating in corners of the eye, most notably in children.  

A number of conditions can cause an increase in the production of rheum in the eye.  In the case of [[allergic conjunctivitis]], the buildup of rheum can be considerable, many times preventing the sufferer opening the eye upon waking without prior cleansing of the eye area.  The presence of [[pus]] in an instance of heavy rheum buildup can indicate [[dry eye]] or [[conjunctivitis]], among other infections.

Occasionally, in infants in their first year, the tear ducts fail to open.  This causes [[epiphora (medical)|epiphora]], that is, with non-patent nasolacrimal ducts, tears have no egress from the body and rheum is released onto surrounding skin.
