==History==

===Jefferson Medical College===
[[File:Tivoli Theater Jefferson Medical College.jpg|150px|left|thumb|The Tivoli Theater in [[Philadelphia]], first home of the [[Jefferson Medical College]].]]
During the early 19th century, several attempts to create a second medical school in Philadelphia had been stymied, largely due to the efforts of [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] alumni<ref>{{cite web| title = George McClellan, Founder| work = A Brief History of Thomas Jefferson University| publisher = Thomas Jefferson University| date =| url = http://jeffline.jefferson.edu/SML/archives/exhibits/175years/index.html| accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref>  In an attempt to circumvent that opposition, a group of Philadelphia physicians led by Dr. [[George McClellan (physician)|George McClellan]] sent a letter to the trustees of Jefferson College in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]] (now [[Washington & Jefferson College]]) in 1824, asking the College to establish a medical department in Philadelphia.<ref name=charitable>{{Cite book| last = Pedrick| first = Alexander K. | title = Charitable Institutions of Pennsylvania| publisher = State Printer of Pennsylvania| year=1898|volume=1| location = | pages = 177–202| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ATTJAAAAMAAJ| chapterurl = http://books.google.com/books?id=ATTJAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA177}}</ref>  The trustees agreed, establishing the Medical Department of Jefferson College in Philadelphia.<ref name=charitable/>  In spite of a vigorous challenge, the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] granted an expansion of Jefferson College's charter in 1826, endorsing the creation of the new department and allowing it to grant [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]]s.<ref name=charitable/><ref name=charter>{{cite web| title = Establishing a School| work = A Brief History of Thomas Jefferson University| publisher = Thomas Jefferson University| date =| url = http://jeffline.jefferson.edu/SML/archives/exhibits/175years/charter.html| accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref>  An additional 10 Jefferson College trustees were appointed to supervise the new facility from Philadelphia, owing to the difficulty of managing a medical department on the other side of the state.<ref name=charitable/>  Two years later, this second board was granted authority to manage the Medical Department, while the Jefferson College trustees maintained veto power for major decisions.<ref name=charitable/>  

The first class was graduated in 1826, receiving their degrees only after the disposition of a lawsuit seeking to close the school.<ref name=charitable/>  The first classes were held in the Tivoli Theater on Prune Street in Philadelphia, which had the first medical clinic attached to a medical school.<ref name=tivoli>{{cite web| title = Early Homes| work = A Brief History of Thomas Jefferson University| publisher = Thomas Jefferson University| date =| url = http://jeffline.jefferson.edu/SML/archives/exhibits/175years/tivoli.html| accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref>  Owing to the teaching philosophy of Dr. McClellan, classes focused on clinical practice.<ref name=tivoli/> In 1828, the Medical Department moved to the Ely Building, which allowed for a large lecture space and the "Pit," a 700-seat amphitheater to allow students to view surgeries.<ref name=tivoli/> This building had an attached hospital, the second such medical school/hospital arrangement in the nation, servicing 441 inpatients and 4,659 outpatients in its first year of operation.<ref name=tivoli/>  The relationship with Jefferson College survived until 1838, when the Medical Department received a separate charter, allowing it operate separately as the Jefferson Medical College.<ref name=charter/><ref name=v18>{{Cite book|editor=Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania|editor-link=Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania| title = The Pennsylvania Medical Journal| publisher = | date = September 1915| chapter= Jefferson Medical College| page = 950|volume=18| chapterurl = http://books.google.com/books?id=lxoTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA950| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=lxoTAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>

By 1844 Jefferson was providing patient beds over a shop at 10th and Sansom Streets. A 125-bed hospital, one of the first in the nation affiliated with a medical school, opened in 1877, and a school for nurses began in 1891. The Medical College became Thomas Jefferson University on July 1, 1969. As an academic health care center, Jefferson is currently involved in education, medical research, and patient care. Jefferson Medical College is the 9th oldest American medical school that is in existence today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upstate.edu/library/history/research/medschoolfoundingdates.php |title=Essay::Health Sciences Library |publisher=Upstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>

==Affiliations==
[[File:Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.jpg|left|thumb|Thomas Jefferson University Hospital]]
The University is affiliated with Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals, Inc (TJUH)&mdash;including Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Jefferson Hospital for Neuroscience, and Methodist Hospital Division of TJUH. Thomas Jefferson University is also the primary academic affiliate of the Jefferson Health System. Jefferson Health System was founded in 1995 when Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and the Main Line Health System signed an agreement establishing a new, nonprofit, corporate entity known as the Jefferson Health System. The agreement brought together the Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals, Inc. and Main Line Health under one corporate parent. Since then, other established networks have joined Jefferson Health System as founding members, which at one point included the [[Albert Einstein Medical Center|Albert Einstein Healthcare Network]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonhealth.org/news/archives.html |title=Jefferson Health System - News archives |publisher=Jeffersonhealth.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref> Frankford Health Care System (now Aria Health),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonhealth.org/news/2008/12-31-08.html |title=Jefferson Health System - JHS and Frankford Health Care System Complete Realignment |publisher=Jeffersonhealth.org |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariahealth.org/default.aspx?pageid=3005 |title=Aria Health History – Frankford Section of Philadelphia |publisher=Ariahealth.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref> and still retains [[Magee Rehabilitation Hospital]] as a member.
