An '''eyepatch''' or '''eye pad''' is a small patch that is worn in front of one [[eye]]. It may be a cloth patch attached around the head by an elastic band or by a string, or an adhesive bandage. It is often worn by people to cover a lost or injured eye, but it also has a therapeutic use in children for the treatment of [[amblyopia]]. ''(See [[orthoptics]] and [[vision therapy]].)'' Eyepatches used to block light while sleeping are referred to as a [[sleep mask]].

==History==
In the years before advanced medicine and surgery, eyepatches were common. They were particularly prevalent among members of dangerous occupations, such as [[blacksmith]]s who used them to cover one eye for protection from sparks while working. Sailors may have also worn them over one eye above deck and then switch it over in order to be able to see in the dark below deck.<ref name='EE'>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | title = Eye eye, matey | accessdate = 2011-05-25}}</ref>

==Sailors and pilots==
It has been speculated that sailors who often went above and below deck might have used an eyepatch to keep one eye adjusted to the darkness below decks.<ref>[http://mythbustersresults.com/epsode71 Mythbusters, episode 71] ''[[Mythbusters]]''</ref>  The strong sunlight while above deck on an oceangoing vessel could require minutes of [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] to the dim lighting below deck. With virtually no light sources below deck, sailors would have to rely heavily upon their eyes to adjust. In the critical moments of modifying the rigging, navigating, and especially during battle, those minutes were too precious. A simple switch of the patch from one eye to the other might have saved time when going between decks. Although this usage of the eyepatch is not supported by any historical records,{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} it was tested during the [[MythBusters]] [[MythBusters (2007 season)#Episode 71 – "Pirate Special"|Pirate Special]] and found to be plausible.

It has also been speculated that covering one eye will prevent or mitigate [[Seasickness]]

Similarly, pilots at one time would also do the same, when flying at night over brightly lit cities, so that one eye could look out, and the other would be adjusted for the dim lighting of the cockpit to read unlit instruments and maps.<ref>Roy Brocklebank (2005). ''WORLD WAR III – The 1960s Version. Journal of Navigation'', 58, pp 341-347 {{doi|10.1017/S0373463305003413}}</ref>  Some military pilots have worn a lead-lined or gold-lined eyepatch, to protect against blindness in both eyes, in the event of a [[Effects of nuclear explosions|nuclear blast]] or [[Laser applications#Eye-targeted lasers|laser weapon]] attack.<ref>[http://www.flightgear.dk/flash.htm Nuclear flash eye protection, Steen Hartov]</ref><ref>[http://www.lesfrazier.com/labs.htm Les Frazier]</ref><ref>[http://hotmedicalnews.com/laser_weapons.php Laser Weapons]</ref>

Eyepatches are not currently used by military personnel; modern technology has provided an array of other means to preserve and enhance night vision, including red-light and low-level white lights, and [[night vision device]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA156271&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf | title = IMMEDIATE VISIBILITY AFTER RED AND WHITE ADAPTATION | accessdate = 2011-06-01 | last = Luria | first = S.

==Eyecare treatment==

===Amblyopia===
Eye patching is used in the [[orthoptics|orthoptic]] management<ref name =GK07>Georgievski Z, Koklanis K, Leone J. Orthoptists' management of amblyopia - a case based survey. Strabismus, 2007, 15(3): 197-203. [Pubmed Link]</ref> of children at risk of lazy eye ([[amblyopia]]), especially [[strabismus|strabismic]] or [[anisometropia|anisometropic]]<ref name = GK08>Georgievski Z, Koklanis K, Leone J. Fixation behaviour in the treatment of amblyopia using atropine. Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology 2008; 36 (Suppl 2): A764–A765. [Link]</ref> amblyopia.  These conditions can cause visual suppression of the dissimilar images by the brain, resulting in blindness in an otherwise functional eye. By patching the good eye, the amblyopic eye is forced to function, causing vision to be retained.<ref name = GK07 /><ref name = GK08 />

===Extraocular muscle palsy===
To initially relieve double vision ([[diplopia]]) caused by an extra-ocular muscle palsy, an [[eye care professional]] may recommend using an eyepatch. This can help to relieve the dizziness, vertigo and nausea that are associated with this form of double vision.<ref name=osullivan>O'Sullivan, S.B & Schmitz, T.J. (2007). Physical Rehabilitation.
