'''Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency''' (CPS I deficiency)<ref name=omim>{{OMIM|237300}}</ref> is an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[metabolic disorder]] that causes [[ammonia]] to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The [[nervous system]] is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia.

==Symptoms==
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency often becomes evident in the first few days of life. An infant with this condition may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have a poorly controlled breathing rate or body temperature. Some babies with this disorder may experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Complications of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency may include developmental delay and mental retardation.

In some affected individuals, signs and symptoms of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency may be less severe, and may not appear until later in life.

== Genetics ==

[[Image:Autorecessive.jpg|thumb|right|Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]         

CPS I deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.<ref name=omim/> This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both [[genetic carrier|carry]] one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.

==Pathophysiology==
Mutations in the ''CPS1'' gene cause carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency belongs to a class of genetic diseases called [[urea cycle]] disorders. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in [[liver]] cells. This cycle processes excess [[nitrogen]], generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys.

In carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency, the enzyme that regulates the urea cycle is damaged or missing. The urea cycle cannot proceed normally, and nitrogen accumulates in the bloodstream in the form of ammonia. Ammonia is especially damaging to the nervous system, and excess ammonia causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency.
