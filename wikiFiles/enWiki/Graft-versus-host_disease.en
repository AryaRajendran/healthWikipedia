'''Graft-versus-host disease''' (GVHD) is a common [[complication (medicine)|complication]] following an [[allogeneic]] tissue transplant. It is commonly associated with [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|stem cell]] or bone marrow transplant but the term also applies to other forms of tissue graft. [[White blood cell|Immune cells]] (white blood cells) in the tissue (the graft) recognize the recipient (the host) as "foreign". The transplanted immune cells then attack the host's body cells. GVHD can also occur after a [[blood transfusion]] if the blood products used have not been irradiated{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

==Causes==
[[File:Three phases of GVHD immuno-biology.jpg|thumb|GVHD pathology]]
[[Billingham Criteria]], 3 criteria must be met in order for GVHD to occur.<ref name="urlGraft-versus-host disease of the vulva and/or vagina: diagnosis and treatment">{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B758K-4B6TN5T-8&_user=646099&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2003&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=gateway&_origin=gateway&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1693279898&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000034699&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=646099&md5=b36a322936a063df71b4a90ef9b879c7&searchtype=a |title= Graft-versus-host disease of the vulva and/or vagina: diagnosis and treatment  |format= |work= |accessdate=2003-03-20}}</ref>
* An [[immunocompetent|immuno-competent]] graft is administered, with viable and functional immune cells.
* The recipient is immunologically disparate - [[histo-incompatible]].
* The recipient is [[immuno-compromised]] and therefore cannot destroy or inactivate the transplanted cells.

After bone marrow transplantation, [[T cell]]s  present in the [[medical grafting|graft]], either as contaminants or intentionally introduced into the host, attack the [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the transplant recipient after perceiving host tissues as antigenically foreign. The T cells produce an excess of [[cytokine]]s, including [[TNF alpha|TNF-α]] and [[interferon-gamma]] (IFNγ). A wide range of host [[antigens]] can initiate graft-versus-host-disease, among them the [[human leukocyte antigens]] (HLAs). However, graft-versus-host disease can occur even when HLA-identical siblings are the donors. HLA-identical siblings or HLA-identical unrelated donors often have genetically different [[protein]]s (called [[minor histocompatibility antigens]]) that can be presented by [[Major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) molecules to the donor's T-cells, which see these antigens as foreign and so mount an immune response.

While donor T-cells are undesirable as effector cells of graft-versus-host-disease, they are valuable for engraftment by preventing the recipient's residual [[immune system]] from rejecting the bone marrow graft ([[Host_vs._graft|host-versus-graft]]). In addition, as bone marrow transplantation is frequently used to treat [[cancer]], mainly [[leukemia]]s, donor T-cells have proven to have a valuable graft-versus-[[tumor]] effect. A great deal of current research on allogeneic bone marrow transplantation involves attempts to separate the undesirable graft-vs-host-disease aspects of T-cell physiology from the desirable [[graft-versus-tumor]] effect.

==Types==
In the clinical setting, graft-versus-host-disease is divided into [[Acute (medical)|acute]] and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] forms.
* The ''acute'' or ''fulminant'' form of the disease (aGVHD) is normally observed within the first 100 days post-transplant,<ref>[http://www.marrow.org/PHYSICIAN/Adv_in_Auto_Allo_Tx/Imprv_Mgmt_of_Graft-Versus-Hos/index.html Improved Management of Graft-Versus-Host Disease] from the [[National Marrow Donor Program]]</ref> and is a major challenge to transplants owing to associated morbidity and mortality.<ref name="Exp. Hematol. 1">{{cite journal |author=Goker H, Haznedaroglu IC, Chao NJ |title=Acute graft-vs-host disease: pathobiology and management |journal=Exp. Hematol. |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=259–77 |year=2001 |pmid=11274753 | url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0301-472X(00)00677-9 |doi=10.1016/S0301-472X(00)00677-9}}</ref>
* The ''chronic'' form of graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD) normally occurs after 100 days. The appearance of moderate to severe cases of cGVHD adversely influences long-term survival.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee SJ, Vogelsang G, Flowers ME |title=Chronic graft-versus-host disease |journal=Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=215–33 |year=2003 |pmid=12720215 |doi=10.1053/bbmt.2003.50026 }}</ref>

This distinction is not arbitrary: Acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease appear to involve different [[immune cell]] subsets, different [[cytokine]] profiles, somewhat different host targets, and respond differently to treatment.{{cn|date=December 2012}}  Acute GVHD is likely caused by alloreactive memory T-cells pre-existant in the graft. The mechanisms by which chronic GVHD develops are as yet ill-defined.

==Clinical manifestation==
In the classical sense, acute graft-versus-host-disease is characterized by selective damage to the [[liver]], [[skin]] (rash), and [[mucosa]], and the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Newer research indicates that other graft-versus-host-disease target organs include the immune system (the [[Haematopoiesis|hematopoietic system]], e.g., the [[bone marrow]] and the [[thymus]]) itself, and the [[lung]]s in the form of idiopathic [[pneumonia|pneumonitis]]. Biomarkers can be used to identify specific causes of GVHD, such as [[elafin]] in the skin.<ref name="Paczesny_2009">{{cite journal | author =  Paczesny S, Levine JE, Hogan J, Crawford J, Braun TM, Wang H, Faca V, Zhang Q, Pitteri S, Chin A, Choi SW, Kitko CL, Krijanovski OI, Reddy P, Mineishi S, Whitfield J,  Jones S, Hanash SM,  Ferrara JLM | title = [Elafin is a Biomarker of Graft Versus Host Disease of the Skin | journal = Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation | volume = 15 | issue = 2 Suppl 1 | pages = 13–14 | year = 2009 | month = February | pmid = | doi = 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.12.039 | url = | issn = }}</ref> Chronic graft-versus-host-disease also attacks the above organs, but over its long-term course can also cause damage to the [[connective tissue]] and [[exocrine glands]].

Acute GVHD of the [[GI tract]] can result in severe intestinal inflammation, sloughing of the mucosal membrane, severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  This is typically diagnosed via intestinal biopsy.  Liver GVHD is measured by the bilirubin level in acute patients.  Skin GVHD results in a diffuse maculopapular rash, sometimes in a lacy pattern.

Mucosal damage to the [[vagina]] can result in severe [[pain]] and [[scarring]], and appears in both acute and chronic GVHD. This can result in an inability to have [[sexual intercourse]].<ref name="urlGraft-versus-host disease of the vulva and/or vagina: diagnosis and treatment" />

Acute GVHD is staged as follows: overall grade (skin-liver-gut) with each organ staged individually from a low of 1 to a high of 4.  Patients with grade IV GVHD usually have a poor prognosis.  If the GVHD is severe and requires intense immunosuppression involving steroids and additional agents to get under control, the patient may develop severe infections as a result of the immunosuppression and may die of infection.

In the [[oral cavity]], chronic graft-versus-host-disease manifests as [[Mucosal lichen planus|lichen planus]] with a higher risk of [[malignant transformation]] to oral [[squamous cell carcinoma]] in comparison to the classical oral lichen planus. Graft-versus-host-disease-associated [[oral cancer]] may have more aggressive behavior with poorer prognosis, when compared to oral cancer in non-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients.<ref name="HSCT">{{cite journal |author=Elad S, Zadik Y, Zeevi I, ''et al.'' |title=Oral cancer in patients after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation: long-term follow-up suggests an increased risk for recurrence |journal=Transplantation |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=1243–4 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21119507 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21119507 |doi=10.1097/TP.0b013e3181f9caaa}}</ref>

==Transfusion-associated GVHD==
{{Main|Transfusion-associated graft versus host disease}}
This type of GVHD is associated with [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] of un-irradiated blood to immunocompromised recipients. It can also occur in situations in which the blood donor is [[homozygous]] and the recipient is [[heterozygous]] for an [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] [[haplotype]]. It is associated with higher mortality (80-90%) due to involvement of bone marrow lymphoid tissue, however the clinical manifestations are similar to GVHD resulting from bone marrow transplantation. Transfusion-associated GVHD is rare in modern medicine. It is almost entirely preventable by controlled irradiation of blood products to inactivate the white blood cells (including lymphocytes) within<ref name="Transfusion 1">{{cite doi|10.1046/j.1537-2995.1997.371098016450.x}}</ref>

==In thymus transplantation==
[[Thymus transplantation]] may be said to be able to cause a special type of GVHD because the recipients [[thymocyte]]s would use the donor thymus cells as models when going through the [[negative selection]] to recognize self-antigens, and could therefore still mistake own structures in the rest of the body for being non-self. This is a rather indirect GVHD because it is not directly cells in the graft itself that causes it but cells in the graft that make the recipient's T cells act like donor T cells. It can be seen as a multiple-organ autoimmunity in [[xenotransplantation]] experiments of the thymus between different species.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Xia G, Goebels J, Rutgeerts O, Vandeputte M, Waer M |title=Transplantation tolerance and autoimmunity after xenogeneic thymus transplantation |journal=J.

</ref> However, this is partially explained by the fact that the indication itself, that is, complete [[DiGeorge syndrome]], increases the risk of autoimmune disease.<ref name=Markert2007>{{cite journal |author=Markert ML, Devlin BH, Alexieff MJ, ''et al.'' |title=Review of 54 patients with complete DiGeorge anomaly enrolled in protocols for thymus transplantation: outcome of 44 consecutive transplants |journal=Blood |volume=109 |issue=10 |pages=4539–47 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17284531 |pmc=1885498 |doi=10.1182/blood-2006-10-048652 |url=}}</ref>

==Prevention==
*[[DNA]]-based tissue typing allows for more precise HLA matching between donors and transplant patients, which has been proven to reduce the incidence and severity of GVHD and to increase long-term survival.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Morishima Y, Sasazuki T, Inoko H, ''et al.'' |title=The clinical significance of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele compatibility in patients receiving a marrow transplant from serologically HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR matched unrelated donors |journal=Blood |volume=99 |issue=11 |pages=4200–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12010826 |doi= 10.1182/blood.V99.11.4200|url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12010826}}</ref>
*The T-cells of umbilical cord blood (UCB) have an inherent immunological immaturity,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grewal SS, Barker JN, Davies SM, Wagner JE |title=Unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation: marrow or umbilical cord blood? |journal=Blood |volume=101 |issue=11 |pages=4233–44 |year=2003 |pmid=12522002 |doi=10.1182/blood-2002-08-2510 }}</ref> and the use of UCB stem cells in unrelated donor transplants has a reduced incidence and severity of GVHD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Laughlin MJ, Barker J, Bambach B, ''et al.'' |title=Hematopoietic engraftment and survival in adult recipients of umbilical-cord blood from unrelated donors |journal=N.

*[[Methotrexate]], [[ciclosporin]] and [[tacrolimus]] are common drugs used for GVHD prophylaxis.
*Graft-versus-host-disease can largely be avoided by performing a T-cell-depleted bone marrow transplant. However, these types of transplants come at a cost of diminished graft-versus-tumor effect, greater risk of engraftment failure, or cancer relapse,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hale G, Waldmann H |title=Control of graft-versus-host disease and graft rejection by T cell depletion of donor and recipient with Campath-1 antibodies. Results of matched sibling transplants for malignant diseases |journal=Bone Marrow Transplant. |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=597–611 |year=1994 |pmid=8054913 }}</ref> and general [[immunodeficiency]], resulting in a patient more susceptible to [[virus|viral]], [[bacterium|bacterial]], and [[fungus|fungal]] [[infection]]. In a multi-center study, disease-free survival at 3 years was not different between T cell-depleted and T cell-replete transplants.<ref>''Lancet'' 2005 Aug 27-Sep 2;366(9487):733-41</ref>

==Treatment of GVHD==
Intravenously administered [[glucocorticoids]], such as [[prednisone]], are the standard of care in acute GVHD<ref name="Exp. Hematol. 1" /> and chronic GVHD.<ref>Menillo S A, Goldberg S L , McKiernan P and Pecora A L [http://www.nature.com/bmt/journal/v28/n8/full/1703231a.html "Intraoral psoralen ultraviolet A irradiation (PUVA) treatment of refractory oral chronic graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic stem cell transplantation"] ''Bone Marrow Transplantation''. October (2) 2001, Volume 28, Number 8, Pages 807-808, www.nature.com. PMID 11781637. Retrieved 11 November 2011</ref> The use of these glucocorticoids is designed to suppress the T-cell-mediated immune onslaught on the host tissues; however, in high doses, this immune-suppression raises the risk of infections and cancer relapse. Therefore, it is desirable to taper off the post-transplant high-level steroid doses to lower levels, at which point the appearance of mild GVHD may be welcome, especially in HLA mis-matched patients, as it is typically associated with a graft-versus-tumor effect.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

==Investigational therapies for graft-versus-host disease==
There are a large number of clinical trials either ongoing or recently completed in the investigation of graft-versus-host disease treatment and prevention.<ref>[http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/results?term=Graft-versus-host+disease search of clinicaltrials.gov for Graft-versus-host disease]</ref>

On May 17, 2012, Osiris Therapeutics announced that Canadian health regulators approved [[Prochymal]], its drug for acute graft-versus host disease in children who have failed to respond to steroid treatment. Prochymal is the first stem cell drug to be approved for a systemic disease. <ref>{{cite web |title= World’s First Stem-Cell Drug Approval Achieved in Canada|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/world-s-first-stem-cell-drug-approval-achieved-canada |publisher=Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP|work=The National Law Review|date=2012-06-12|accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref>
