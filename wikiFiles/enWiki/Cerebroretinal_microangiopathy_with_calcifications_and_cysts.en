Cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts is alternatively known as the '''Coats plus''' syndrome,<ref name="pmid15002047"/> a reference to its most typical ocular [[phenotype]].

==Presentation==
===Before birth===
A child who has inherited this disorder will grow slower than normal in the [[uterus]] before birth and typically will be born [[Preterm birth|before term]].<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/><ref name="pmid15002047"/> The pregnancy can be complicated by [[gestational hypertension]] and [[pre-eclampsia]].

===After birth===
The majority of affected children present with ''symptoms and signs relating to the eyes'' such as [[leukokoria]], redness, irritation and impaired vision, which result from [[retinal detachment]] and [[glaucoma]].<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/><ref name="pmid15002047"/> A minority present with ''[[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] or [[spasticity]]''. The time of onset of symptoms varies from [[Infant|infancy]] to [[adolescence]]. Because a child born [[Preterm birth|before term]] will need to undergo screening for [[retinopathy of prematurity]], some will have abnormalities in their retinal blood vessels detected when they have no symptoms yet.

==Signs and Symptoms==
===Brain===
Neurologic symptoms and signs vary depending on the site of the brain abnormalities. Common symptoms are partial [[epilepsy]], asymmetric [[spasticity]], [[ataxia]] and [[Cognition|cognitive]] impairment.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/><ref name="pmid15002047"/> The latter affects visuospatial and visuoconstructive skills first. The [[intracranial pressure]] can be elevated if [[cyst]]s develop in the brain. [[Migraine]]-like headaches can occur.

===Eyes===
Smaller [[blood vessel]]s of the [[retina]] are abnormally developed and appear tortuous and dilated to a variable extent, typically in one sector and mainly in the peripheral and temporal portions of the retina.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/><ref name="pmid15002047"/><ref name="pmid3402627">{{cite journal | author = Tolmie JL, Browne BH, McGettrick PM, Stephenson JB | title = A familial syndrome with Coats' reaction retinal angiomas, hair and nail defects and intracranial calcification | journal = Eye (Lond) | volume = 2 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 297–303 | year = 1988 | month = | pmid = 3402627 | pmc = | doi = 10.1038/eye.1988.56}}</ref> This is known as [[telangiectasia]]. The vessel walls are week and leak [[blood plasma]] and [[Blood lipids|lipid]] within and underneath the retina. This leakage can lead to exudative [[retinal detachment]], also known as exudative retinopathy in this context. The detachment typically has a yellowish tint because the fluid under the retina contains lipid. These findings mimic [[Coats disease]].<ref name="pmid3402627">{{cite journal | author = Tolmie JL, Browne BH, McGettrick PM, Stephenson JB | title = A familial syndrome with coats' reaction retinal angiomas, hair and nail defects and intracranial calcification | journal = Eye (Lond) | volume = 2 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 297–303 | year = 1988 | month = | pmid = 3402627 | pmc = | doi = 10.1038/eye.1988.56}}</ref> Characteristically, the abnormal vessels are localized and the retinal blood vessels peripheral to the abnormal ones seemingly have failed to develop and are thus not seen.

In some eyes, retinal vessels form small nodules on the surface of the retina, known as [[angioma]]s.<ref name="pmid16943371"/> These can bleed and be attached to the [[vitreous humour]]. The attachment can cause traction [[retinal detachment]].

===Gastrointestinal tract===
Recurrent [[Intestine|intestinal]] bleeding is fairly common.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/><ref name="pmid21373254"/> It originates from [[Telangiectasia|telangiectatic]] small blood vessels in the intestinal mucosa. Additional findings in some individuals are [[portal hypertension]] and [[liver failure]].<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/>

===Blood===
Many affected children develop [[anemia]], which may be macrocytic in type.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/><ref name="pmid11992766"/> Some also develop [[thrombocytopenia]]. Bone marrow examinations may show [[megaloblast]]s and increased [[erythropoiesis]] or [[bone marrow suppression]].<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/><ref name="pmid11992766"/>

===Bones===
The long bones show [[osteopenia]] and [[pathologic fracture]]s can occur.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/><ref name="pmid11992766"/><ref name="pmid21523908"/>

===Skin, nails and hair===
Some children have sparse and greying hair, [[café au lait spot]]s and [[nail dystrophy]].<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/><ref name="pmid3402627"/>

===General===
Most patients continue to grow poorly after birth.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid15002047"/>

==Genetics==

Typical childhood-onset cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts is caused by [[Compound heterozygosity|compound heterozygous]] [[mutation]]s in the conserved [[telomere]] maintenance component 1 (''CTC1'') [[gene]]<ref name=CTC1gene>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ''CTC1'' | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/80169}}</ref> located in [[Chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17p.31]].<ref name="pmid22267198"/><ref name="PolviA"/> A late-onset [[phenotype]] without abnormal eye findings from a ''CTC1'' mutation has been reported.<ref name="PolviA"/>

CTC1<ref name="CTC1gene"/> is a component of the CST complex,<ref name=pmid19854131>{{cite journal | author = Surovtseva YV, Churikov D, Boltz KA, Song X, Lamb JC, Warrington R, Leehy K, Heacock M, Price CM, Shippen DE | title = Conserved telomere maintenance component 1 interacts with STN1 and maintains chromosome ends in higher eukaryotes | journal = Mol Cell | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–18| year = 2009 | month = Oct | pmid = 19854131 | pmc = | doi =10.1016/j.molcel.2009.09.017}}</ref> which is additionally composed of oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold containing 1 (coded by ''OBFC1'',<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: OBFC1 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79991}}</ref> also known as STN1) and [[telomerase]] capping complex subunit homolog 1 (coded by ''TEN1'').<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: TEN1 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/100134934}}</ref> CST complex is evolutionarily conserved.<ref name="pmid19854131"/> It binds to single-stranded DNA and associates with a fraction of [[telomere]]s, potentially protecting them.

==Pathophysiology==
Numeous bnormal small dilated telangiectatic vessels with thickened, sclerotic and calcified walls and angiomas have been found in those brain areas which also show calcifications.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/> 

By analogy to [[Coats disease]], the exudative retinopathy is thought to result from breakdown of the [[blood-retinal barrier]] at the level of the vascular [[Endothelium|endothelial cell]], resulting in leakage of blood plasma and [[Blood lipid|lipid]].<ref name="pmid6502405">{{cite journal | author = Chang MM, McLean IW, Merritt JC | title = Coats' disease: a study of 62 histologically confirmed cases | journal = J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 163–8 | year = 1984 | month = Sep | pmid = 6502405 | pmc = | doi = }}</ref> [[Macrophage]]s then migrate into the retina and subretinal space and digest the lipid. The accumulation of the proteinaceous exudate and macrophages thickens the [[retina]], leading to exudative [[retinal detachment]].

==Diagnosis==
===Clinical===
The retinal changes are easily identified by [[ophthalmoscopy]], which is performed under [[general anesthesia]] if the child is very young. The abnormal vessels are even better seen with [[fluorescein angiography]]. In advanced disease, [[glaucoma]] is diagnosed by measuring [[intraocular pressure]] and cataract by using [[slit lamp]] biomicroscopy.

===Imaging findings===
The most consistent finding are widespread calcifications, which involve
the [[white matter]] of the [[cerebrum]] mostly adjacent to the junction with the [[grey matter]], the [[Thalamus|thalami]], the [[basal ganglia]] and the [[brainstem]].<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/> The white matter of the [[cerebellum]] and the [[Dentate nucleus|dentate nuclei]] are less often involved. However, the brain may appear normal in the neonatal period. The calcifications are visible both with [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]] and with [[magnetic resonance imaging]].

Magnetic resonance imaging shows additionally diffuse or patchy [[white matter]] changes, especially in the periventricular region, the thalami and the [[internal capsule]]. Cerebellar and brainstem lesions are less common. Imaging also uncovers parenchymal cysts situated mainly in the thalamic region and more rarely in the brainstem, the [[parietal lobe]] and the [[frontal lobe]].

The long bones may be [[osteopenia|osteopenic]] and various skeletal changes are found in several patients, such as metaphyseal sclerosis and mild flaring, which is most pronounced in the [[femur]] and  [[tibia]].<ref name="pmid15002047"/><ref name="pmid11992766"/><ref name="pmid21523908"/>

===Laboratory findings===
The [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and blood tests are typically normal, except for [[anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]] in some children.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/><ref name="pmid11992766"/>

==Screening==

Because of the rarity of the syndrome, it is not routinely screened before birth. [[Prenatal diagnosis]] is possible in families in which a prior child has been diagnosed, because the responsible gene ''CTC1''is known.<ref name="pmid22267198"/><ref name="PolviA"/>

==Management==

Seizures are managed with anticonvulsive medications.

[[Laser coagulation]] or [[cryoablation]] (freezing) of the retina can be used to destroy the abnormal blood vessels. [[Retinal detachment]] is repaired with a [[scleral buckle]] or with [[vitrectomy]]. Removal or [[enucleation of the eye]] is a last resort option if the eye already has become blind and painful.

Repeated [[blood transfusion]]s may be needed to control [[anemia]], and [[thrombocytopenia]] can be managed with [[splenectomy]].<ref name="pmid16943371"/>

==Prognosis==
The neurological symptoms are progressive and can lead to severe [[spasticity]], [[Corticobulbar tract|bulbar symptoms]] and [[dysarthria]] within one to two decades.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid15002047"/> The life span is shorter than normal. Death occurs between 2 and 30 years of age, depending on the severity of the syndrome. The immediate cause of death is [[pneumonia]], fulminant intestinal bleeding or [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ dysfunction]].<ref name="pmid16943371"/>

If not treated, the retinal detachment can lead to [[ischemia]] and [[Rubeosis iridis|growth of new blood vessels]] over the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and [[Anterior chamber of eyeball|anterior chamber angle]]. This in turn can cause secondary [[glaucoma]], [[cataract]] and, ultimately, [[blindness]] of the eye.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/>

==Epidemiology==

This syndrome is usually sporadic although families with two or more affected siblings of both sexes are known.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid15002047"/>

==History==

A child who was eventually diagnosed with cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts was first described in the literature in 1987.<ref name="pmid3402627"/><ref name="pmid3556653">{{cite journal | author = McGettrick PM, Loeffler KU | title = Bilateral Coats' disease in an infant (a clinical, angiographic, light and electron microscopic study) | journal = Eye (Lond) | volume = 1 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 136–45 | year = 1988 | month = | pmid = 3556653 | pmc = | doi = 10.1038/eye.1987.20}}</ref> The disorder was suspected of being allelic with either the [[Revesz syndrome]]<ref name="pmid18076099"/> or leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/> However, [[Revesz syndrome]], a severe variant of [[dyskeratosis congenita]], was later shown to result from heterozygous dominant mutations in the ''TINF2'' gene,<ref name="pmid18252230">{{cite journal | author = Savage SA, Giri N, Baerlocher GM, Orr N, Lansdorp PM, Alter BP | title = TINF2, a component of the shelterin telomere protection complex, is mutated in dyskeratosis congenita | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 501–9 | year = 2008 | month = Feb | pmid = 18252230 | pmc = 2427222| doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.10.004}}</ref> which encodes TRF1-interacting nuclear factor 2, a major component of the [[telomere]] protecting shelterin complex, and individuals with the leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts [[phenotype]] have not had mutations in the ''CTC1'' gene.<ref name="pmid22267198"/><ref name="PolviA"/> 

Before the causative mutation was identified, mutations were sought from the [[Wnt signalling pathway]] because its components were known to be responsible for [[Norrie disease]] and [[familial exudative vitreoretinopathy]], which share features of the eye phenotype but not the brain or systemic abnormalities.<ref name="pmid16943371"/><ref name="pmid18076099"/>
