'''David Alter''' (December 3, 1807 – September 18, 1881) was a prominent [[United States|American]] inventor and scientist of the 19th century. He was born in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]], [[Pennsylvania]] and graduated from the Reformed Medical School in [[New York City]]. He had [[Germans|German]] and [[Swiss]] ancestry.

==Inventions==

Dr. David Alter is credited with having invented:
*1836 - the [[electric telegraph]], predating the [[Samuel Morse|Morse]] telegraph in 1837.<ref>Albert, 1882.</ref><ref name="Wiley">Wiley, 1891.</ref><ref name="Scott">Scott.</ref> 
*1840 - his electric buggy - the forerunner of the automobile.
*1845 - a patented method to manufacture and purify [[bromine]] from [[salt well]]s, highly useful in the iron industry and displayed in the [[World's Fair]] of 1853 (see: [[Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations]] in New York City). 
*1854  - [[Spectroscopy|spectrum analysis]], the idea that every element has its own [[emission spectrum]]: a breakthrough development in [[spectroscopy]]. The published article was: ''On Certain Physical Properties of Light Produced by the Combustion of Different Metals in an Electric Spark Refracted by a Prism''.<ref>Alter, 1854.</ref> He included a chart of the colored lines or bands of twelve metals and paved the way by showing the spectral lines of brass corresponded to copper and zinc. 
*1855 - an expansion of [[Spectroscopy|spectrum analysis]] to include the optical properties of gas.<ref>Alter, 1855.</ref> These discoveries were later implemented and included by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]] in the [[Spectroscopy|Three Laws of Spectroscopy]].
*1858 - a patented method to extract ''oil'' from ''coal'' and [[shale]], along with a partner Samuel Hill. Their invention sped manufacturing, but was replaced by technology in a few years.
*An [[electric clock]].
*A short range type of [[telephone]] - forerunner of the [[Alexander Graham Bell|Graham Bell]] telephone.

==Biography==
Dr. David Alter (1807-1881) was a doctor, scientist, and famous American inventor, son of John Alter and Eleanor Sheetz. "David began as a physician and scientist in Elderton, Pennsylvania in the 1830s. David Alter married (1st) Laura Rowley, and they settled in Elderton."<ref name="Rowley">Rowley, 2002.</ref>

In 1836 Elderton, David Alter invented the electric telegraph, one year before the popular [[Samuel Morse|Morse]] telegraph was invented. David rigged the telegraph between his house and his barn. He was interviewed about the discovery going unobserved by other inventors and said: "I may say that there is no connection at all between the telegraph of Morse and others and that of myself...Professor Morse most probably never heard of me or my Elderton telegraph."<ref name="Wiley" />

David Alter obtained medical schooling at the Reformed Medical College in New York City (debated on the dates), and at the Cincinnati Medical School (1841-1842). 

David Alter settled in [[Freeport, Pennsylvania]] about 1837. David’s first wife Laura died in 1842, and several years later he married her sister, Amanda Rowley. He had a total of thirteen (13) children. He manufactured bromine near his home, manned a weather station, worked as a physician, and was one of the first daguerreotype photographers of the town of Freeport.

Inventions while in Freeport: "In the great [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] Fire of 1845, he found a shard of melted glass that gave him the idea of the light spectrum. He went on to discover Spectral Analysis in 1853. He also invented and patented a method of manufacturing Bromine from salt wells in 1845, that was highly useful in the iron industry and was put on display in the World's fair."<ref name="Rowley" /> Dr. Alter resided in Freeport until his death in 1881.
