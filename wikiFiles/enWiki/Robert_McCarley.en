'''Robert W. McCarley''', MD, is Chair and Professor of Psychiatry at [[Harvard Medical School]] and the [[VA Boston Healthcare System]].  He is also Director of the Laboratory of Neuroscience located at the [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]] VA Medical Center and the [[McLean Hospital]].  McClarley is a prominent researcher in the field of [[sleep]] and [[dream]]ing as well as [[schizophrenia]].

McCarley graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1959 and Harvard Medical School in 1964.  During his residency at Massachusetts Mental Health Center, he studied with [[Allan Hobson|J. Allan Hobson]].  In 1977, Hobson and McCarley developed the [[activation synthesis theory]] of dreaming that said that dreams do not have meanings and are the result of the brain attempting to make sense of random neuronal firing in the cortex.<ref>Hobson JA, McCarley RW. The brain as a dream state generator: an activation-synthesis hypothesis of the dream process. Am J Psychiatry. 1977 Dec;134(12):1335-48</ref> McCarley has extensively studied the [[brainstem]] mechanisms that control [[REM sleep]].<ref>McCarley RW.
 Neurobiology of REM and NREM sleep. Sleep Med. 2007 Jun;8(4):302-30.</ref>  Additionally, he has studied the build up of [[adenosine]] in the [[basal forebrain]] following [[sleep deprivation]].<ref>Basheer R, Strecker RE, Thakkar MM, McCarley RW. Adenosine and sleep-wake regulation. Prog Neurobiol. 2004 Aug;73(6):379-96.</ref>

In the area of schizophrenia, McCarley has studied brain abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia.  McCarley and Martha Shenton published a classic paper in 1992 that described a relationship in a reduction in the volume of the left [[superior temporal gyrus]] and [[thought disorder]] in patients with schizophrenia.<ref>Shenton ME, Kikinis R, Jolesz FA, et al. Abnormalities of the left temporal lobe and thought disorder in schizophrenia. A quantitative magnetic resonance imaging study. N Engl J Med. 1992 Aug 27;327(9):604-12.</ref>

McCarley has been presented with many awards for his research.  In 1998, he received William S. Middleton Award which is the highest honor awarded to a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] biomedical research scientist.<ref>[http://www.research.va.gov/programs/blrd/research-awards.cfm#1998 VA Research Awards Program]</ref>  He has also been presented awards from the [[Sleep Research Society]], [[American Psychiatric Association]], and [[American Academy of Sleep Medicine]].

In 2007, McCarley was ranked as the ninth most cited author in the field of schizophrenia research over the past decade.<ref>[http://esi-topics.com/schizophrenia/ Essential Science Indicators], Special Topics-Schizophrenia</ref> McCarley has publish around 300 research articles and several books and book chapters such as ''Brain Control of Wakefulness and Sleep''.<ref>Steriade MM and McCarley RW. Brain Control of Wakefulness and Sleep. Springer; 2nd ed. edition, 2005.</ref>
