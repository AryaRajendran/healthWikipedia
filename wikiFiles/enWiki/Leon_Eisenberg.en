He received both his BA and MD degrees from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], taught previously at both the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]], and was Chief of Psychiatry at both Johns Hopkins Hospital in [[Baltimore]] and the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]] during formative periods in psychiatry for each institution.

==Medical accomplishments==
The reasons Leon Eisenberg is listed as a [[List of famous figures in psychiatry|famous figure in world and American psychiatry]] are numerous. Leon Eisenberg identified rapid return to school as the key to treatment in the management of the [[separation anxiety disorder|separation anxiety]] underlying school [[phobia]]. He completed the first outcome study of autistic children in adolescence and recognized patterns of language use as the best predictor of prognosis. Of the two first studies of the outcome of infantile autism, he reported the American study in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' in 1956, and the UK study was reported in ''[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121671978/abstract JCPP]'' shortly afterward by [http://www.kent.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/542C3683-5268-491C-94AB-893425CF5269/0/ASDReport.pdf Victor Lotter] and Sir [[Michael Rutter]]. That was a time when a narrow rather than a broad definition of autism was in fashion. It is of interest that the poor prognosis was evident both in the narrowly- and broadly-defined cases and that, because many of the cases now called autistic would have been called "mental retardation: moderate to severe", they would have joined other such children with a relatively poor outcome.

He was Principal Investigator (PI) on the first grant from the Psychopharmacology Branch of NIMH for RCTs in child psychopharmacology. From a concern for [[evidence-based]] care, well before the phrase was coined, he introduced [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs) in [[psychopharmacology]] and showed that "tranquilizing" drugs were inferior to placebo in the treatment of [[anxiety disorders]], whereas stimulant drugs were effective in controlling [[hyperactivity]]. He completed the first RCTs of psychiatric consultation to social agencies and of the utility of brief psychotherapy in anxiety disorders. He published a forceful critique of [[Konrad Lorenz]]'s instinct theory. He established the usefulness of distinguishing "[[disease]]" from "[[illness]]". He has highlighted the environmental context as a determinant of the [[phenotype]] emerging from a given [[genotype]], and from the late 1990s through 2006, he had been involved with developing conferences and resources for medical educators in various specialties that would help them incorporate, into courses with their current and future students, the tidal wave of new information in [[genomics]] yet to puzzle future clinicians.  This interest may have been encouraged by his stepson, Dr. Alan Guttmacher, Acting Head of the National Human Genome Research Institute.  For many decades, Leon Eisenberg had criticized [[psychoanalysis]] from a number of platforms.

The scientific contributions of Dr. Eisenberg include:
* the first longitudinal follow-up of [[Leo Kanner]]'s original cases of [[autism]]
* a study that identified the roots of social phobia in parental anxiety
* the first clinical trial of the effectiveness of psychiatric consultation in a social agency
* the first [[randomized controlled trial]] in childhood [[psychopharmacology]]
* the first randomized controlled trial of stimulant drugs in adolescents
* the first randomized clinical trial of brief psychotherapy
* a forceful critique of Lorenz’s theory of instincts and [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]
* an early statement of the distinction between “disease” (what doctors deal with) and “illness” (what patients suffer)
* a widely-cited critique of the oscillation of psychiatry between brain-centered and mind-centered approaches arguing for the integration of the two
* a synthesis of the evidence on the importance of training primary care physicians to recognize and treat depression
* papers that highlight the molding of the brain structure by social experience
* publications putting inheritance in an environmental context as a determinant of risk and resilience.
* Called "the father of prevention science in psychiatry"<ref>[http://breezemsprod2.tch.harvard.edu/p31549563/?launcher=false&fcsContent=true&pbMode=normal Video of the announcement of the Leon Eisenberg Chair in Psychiatry at Children's Hospital Boston, in which Dr. William Beardslee, a colleague, notes the grounds for Eisenberg's being considered the founder of preventive psychiatry]</ref>
Specific publications referring to the above achievements are contained in his bibliography

Leon Eisenberg is proudest of the Diversity Lifetime Achievement Award he received in 2001 for his role in inaugurating affirmative action at HMS in 1968 and sustaining it as Chairman of the Admissions Committee from 1969 to 1974. He regards that as his most important contribution to [[Harvard Medical School]].

With his wife, Dr. [[Carola B. Eisenberg]], former Dean of Students, first at [[MIT]], then at [[Harvard Medical School]], he has been active with [http://www.PHRUSA.org/ Physicians for Human Rights], which as an organization received a Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for its [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]].

In mid-2009 (June 22, 2009), a [http://www.harvardscience.harvard.edu/medicine-health/articles/harvard-medical-school-fetes-scholar-names-chair Leon Eisenberg Chair in Child Psychiatry was named at Children's Hospital Boston]. The first chairholder of the Leon Eisenberg Professorship in Child Psychiatry is [http://www.childrenshospital.org/cfapps/research/data_admin/Site265/mainpageS265P0.html David R. DeMaso, MD], HMS Professor of Psychiatry and Psychiatrist-in-Chief at [http://www.childrenshospital.org Children's Hospital Boston].

His brief (~30 pages) autographical memoir (a walk through the history of psychiatry, yet to be published posthumously by Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica - in mid- or late-2010) "Were we asleep at the switch?" [See below] was written from his home, but how can such a transformative life be encapsulated in a BRIEF memoir?

==Humor==
Among his friends and professional colleagues, Leon Eisenberg was known for his humor and friendly wit which he shared in lectures, publications, and even as Recording Secretary for the [http://www.AmAcad.org American Academy of Arts and Sciences] (sometimes in the forum of haiku).<ref>[http://www.AmAcad.org AmAcad]</ref>  

Collecting his humor is difficult (often it was in personal e-mails), but many agree that a few typical scenarios recurred:
* Several persons of different social backgrounds involved in a difficult, odd, or even humorous situation, usually with a Jewish psychiatrist or a rabbi [often exploring social nuances and varying perceptions].
* A very wise person involved with something very unusual [e.g. Chinese mathematician sipping tea (about moral outrage)].
* A well-known historical event [e.g. The last survivor of the Johnstown Flood (about humility before esteemed colleagues)].<ref>[http://breezemsprod2.tch.harvard.edu/p31549563/?launcher=false&fcsContent=true&pbMode=normal This story was retold by colleague Dr. Arthur Kleinman at the announcement of the Leon Eisenberg Chair at Children's Hospital Boston, between 1:13:00 and 1:14:00.]</ref>
* Poetry (often haiku)

Close friends (and fans) described his stories as customized for each occasion (so they never tired of hearing the same stories repeated because, with customization, they never were the same story or joke).

==Death==
Leon Eisenberg died of [[prostate cancer]] at his home in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on September 15, 2009.<ref>Benedict Carey, [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/health/research/24eisenberg.html Dr. Leon Eisenberg, Pioneer in Autism Studies, Dies at 87] ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved on October 3, 2009.</ref>

Memorial Services were held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in September 2009, and in Boston, Massachusetts, at the [[Harvard Medical School]], on March 12, 2010.

==Academic committees==
Leon Eisenberg served on seemingly countless academic and other committees at Johns Hopkins, Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Children's Hospital Boston.  He was typically among the first thought and invited to such committees because of his breadth.

Attempts to identify a full set of such committees are proceeding.

==Themes of most recent writing==
Leon Eisenberg is credited by numerous colleagues with "simple and direct" prose ([[Arthur Kleinman]], [http://ghsm.hms.harvard.edu/people/faculty/ware/ Norma Ware], etc.). He will be remembered most for his writings in these areas, though his encyclopedic comprehension reached much more broadly:
* [[Evidence-based]] medicine
** Capacity of academics to accept ideas that are absurd and later rejected
* Why and how did [[psychoanalysis]] come to be so dominant for so long (the triumph of psychopharmacology over psychotherapy and changes in the way care was financed) has been explored repeatedly, but outlined here in two papers for different Josiah Macy Conferences:
** "Modern Psychiatry: Challenges in Educating Health Professionals to Meet New Needs"
** "The Challenge of Neuroscience: Behavioral Science, Neurology, and Psychiatry"
* Diagnostic classifications (see below) - a theme continued from the very beginning of his career
* Human rights of patients
* [http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9909/01/adhd.overdiagnosis/index.html Overdiagnosis of ADHD]
* [[Conflict of Interest]] (COI) in the Practice of Psychiatry and Medicine
** Issues in rewriting the entire psychiatric taxonomy at one time ([[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] = DSM): COI, empirical evidence to support DSM changes, timing of revisions
** Complicity of the medical and psychiatric professionals in torture.
** Criticizing the replacement of patient interests with the profit motive in healthcare.<ref>[http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/ Eisenberg, L. Marketplace Medicine: Prescription for Disaster.  ''Academe'': Bulletin of The American Association of University Professors 1999;85:26-30]</ref>
** The relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and medical education through sponsorship and educational programs.

==Later autobiographical reflections: "Were We Asleep at the Switch?"==
Leon Eisenberg had written from his home a 38-page ‘mini-autobiography’ which he named 
"Were We Asleep at the Switch?"  Eisenberg argued that, while medical scientists were worrying about the tedious science at the base of medical practice and healthcare decisions for the general public, "money" and monied interests had been making de facto decisions for the populace about how things that affected them deeply were going to be done.  In this view, the overwhelming impact of economic considerations over emerging bodies of expert knowledge may have rendered and might continue to render futile the professional contributions of many brilliant, timely, and concerned working scientists.
