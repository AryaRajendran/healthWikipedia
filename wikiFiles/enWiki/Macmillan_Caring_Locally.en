'''Macmillan Caring Locally''' (formerly '''The Macmillan Cancer Trust''') is a British [[registered charity]] (no. 268218), which was formed in 1974 to support a [[palliative care]] unit at [[Christchurch Hospital, Dorset|Christchurch Hospital]] in [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], [[Dorset]], southern [[England]]. It now also operates Albany Lodge, a hotel in [[Bournemouth]] for [[cancer]] patients and carers, and supports a range of posts and services for cancer diagnosis and treatment at the [[Royal Bournemouth Hospital]].<ref>[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ShowCharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=268218&SubsidiaryNumber=0 Charity Commission Listing]</ref>

==History==
The trust evolved from the fund-raising committee for the building of the first Macmillan unit in the country at Christchurch Hospital. This committee included amongst its members representatives from the [[League of Friends]] at the Royal Victoria Hospital (now closed and incorporated into the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospital) and the local branch of the National Society for Cancer Relief (now [[Macmillan Cancer Support]]).<ref name=MCT>[http://www.macmillanlocal.org/about-us.php Macmillan Cancer Trust - About us]</ref>

During the final stages of building, it was decided to form a [[Charitable trust|trust]] to be identified with the unit and it was registered as a charity on 25 July 1974.

It was re-branded in 2009 as Macmillan Caring Locally, reducing the scope for confusion with the UK national cancer charity [[Macmillan Cancer Support]].

==Services==
The aims of the trust are to support those who are suffering from cancer and other terminal diseases where no cure is expected, and to provide help and support for family members. Latterly the trust has aided services which provide early diagnosis of cancers with a view to enabling early treatment and, ideally, recovery.<ref name=MCT />

The trust's total expenditure on charitable activities in 2009 was Â£1.2&nbsp;million,<ref>[http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/SHOWCHARITY/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=268218&SubsidiaryNumber=0 268218 - Macmillan Caring Locally], Charity Commission website</ref> responding to a wide variety of needs supporting the [[National Health Service|NHS]], primarily for the Macmillan Unit, but also for other cancer sufferers in south east [[Dorset]] and west [[Hampshire]].
