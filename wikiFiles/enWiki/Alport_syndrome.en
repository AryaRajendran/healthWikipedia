'''Alport syndrome''' or '''hereditary nephritis''' is a [[genetic disorder]]<ref>[http://www.cc.utah.edu/~cla6202/Chap.htm Diseases of the Kidney: Alport Syndrome]</ref> characterized by [[glomerulonephritis]], endstage kidney disease, and hearing loss.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000003191|Alport syndrome}}</ref> Alport syndrome can also affect the eyes (lenticonus). The presence of [[blood]] in the [[urine]] ([[hematuria]]) is almost always found in this condition.

It was first identified in a British family by Dr. [[Cecil A. Alport]] in 1927,<ref name="pmid18923659">{{cite journal |author=Lagona E, Tsartsali L, Kostaridou S, Skiathitou A, Georgaki E, Sotsiou F |title=Skin Biopsy for the diagnosis of Alport Syndrome |journal=Hippokratia |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=116–8 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18923659 |pmc=2464308 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>A. C. Alport. Hereditary familial congenital haemorrhagic nephritis. ''British Medical Journal'', London, 1927, I: 504-506.</ref> though [[William Howship Dickinson]] is considered by some to have made contributions to the characterization.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|337}}</ref>

==Causes==
Alport syndrome is caused by [[mutation]]s in [[COL4A3]], [[COL4A4]], and [[COL4A5]], [[collagen]] biosynthesis genes. Mutations in any of these genes prevent the proper production or assembly of the [[type IV collagen]] network, which is an important structural component of basement membranes in the [[kidney]], inner [[ear]], and [[human eye|eye]]. [[Basement membrane]]s are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. When mutations prevent the formation of type IV collagen fibers, the basement membranes of the kidneys are not able to filter waste products from the blood and create urine normally, allowing blood and [[protein]] into the urine. 

The abnormalities of type IV collagen in kidney basement membranes cause gradual scarring of the kidneys, eventually leading to kidney failure in many people with the disease. Progression of the disease leads to basement membrane thickening and gives a "basket-weave" appearance from splitting of the lamina densa. Single molecule computational studies of type IV collagen molecules have shown changes in the structure and nanomechanical behavior of mutated molecules, notably leading to a bent molecular shape with kinks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Srinivasan M, Uzel SGM, Gautieri A, Keten S, Buehler MJ |title=Alport Syndrome mutations in type IV tropocollagen alter molecular structure and nanomechanical properties  |journal=J. Structural Biology |volume=168 |issue=3 |pages=503–510 |year=2009|pmid=19729067|doi=10.1016/j.jsb.2009.08.015}}</ref>

==Inheritance patterns==
Alport syndrome can have different inheritance patterns that are dependent on the genetic mutation.

* In most people with Alport syndrome, the condition is inherited in an [[X-linked]] dominant pattern, due to mutations in the COL4A5 gene. A condition is considered X-linked if the gene involved in the disorder is located on the [[X chromosome]]. In males, who have only one X chromosome, one altered copy of the COL4A5 gene is sufficient to cause severe Alport syndrome, explaining why most affected males eventually develop kidney failure. In females, who have two X chromosomes, a mutation in one copy of the COL4A5 gene usually results in blood in the urine, but most affected females do not develop kidney failure.
* Alport syndrome can be inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern if both copies of the COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene, located on [[chromosome 2 (human)|chromosome 2]], have been mutated. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.
* Past descriptions of an [[autosomal dominant]] form are now usually categorized as other conditions,<ref name="urlOMIM - ALPORT SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=104200 |title=OMIM - ALPORT SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> though some uses of the term in reference to the COL4A3 and COL4A4  loci have been published.<ref name="pmid16970251">{{cite journal |author=Kharrat M, Makni S, Makni K, ''et al.'' |title=Autosomal dominant Alport's syndrome: study of a large Tunisian family |journal=Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=320–5 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16970251 |doi= |url=http://www.sjkdt.org/article.asp?issn=1319-2442;year=2006;volume=17;issue=3;spage=320;epage=325;aulast=Kharrat}}</ref><ref name="pmid15086897">{{cite journal |author=Pescucci C, Mari F, Longo I, ''et al.'' |title=Autosomal-dominant Alport syndrome: natural history of a disease due to COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=1598–603 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15086897 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.00560.x}}</ref> Autosomal dominant transmission is rare and only accounts for 5% of affected patients.The clinical  features of autosomal dominant Alport syndrome are similar to those of X-linked disease. However, deterioration of renal function tends to occur more slowly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cheungpasitporn W|coauthors=Kaewpoowat Q, Suksaranjit P, Kittanamongkolchai W, Srivali N, Ungprasert P, Rangan Y|title=Autosomal Dominant Alport Syndrome Presenting  as Proteinuria at Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test: A Case Report and Review.|journal=J Nephrol Therapeut|year=2012|volume=S8|doi=10.4172/2161-0959.S8-001}}</ref>

==Criteria for the clinical diagnosis==
Gregory et al., 1996, gave the following 10 criteria for the diagnosis of Alport syndrome<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gregory MC, Terreros DA, Barker DF, Fain PN, Denison JC, Atkin CL |title=Alport syndrome--clinical phenotypes, incidence, and pathology |journal=Contrib Nephrol |volume=117 |issue= |pages=1–28 |year=1996 |pmid=8801040 |doi=}}</ref> (four of the 10 criteria must be met):
* Family history of [[nephritis]] of unexplained haematuria in a first degree relative of the [[index case]] or in a male relative linked through any numbers of females.
* Persistent haematuria without evidence of another possibly inherited nephropathy such as [[thin GBM disease]], [[polycystic kidney disease]] or [[IgA nephropathy]].
* Bilateral [[sensorineural hearing loss]] in the 2000 to 8000&nbsp;Hz range. The hearing loss develops gradually, is not present in early infancy and commonly presents before the age of 30 years.
* A [[mutation]] in [[COL4An]] (where n = 3, 4 or 5).
* [[Immunohistochemistry|Immunohistochemical]] evidence of complete or partial lack of the Alport [[epitope]] in glomerular, or epidermal basement membranes, or both.
* Widespread [[GBM]] ultrastructural abnormalities, in particular thickening, thinning and splitting.
* Ocular lesions including [[anterior lenticonus]], [[posterior subcapsular cataract]], [[posterior polymorphous dystrophy]] and retinal flecks.
* Gradual progression to [[ESRD]] in the index case of at least two family members.
* [[Macrothrombocytopenia]] or granulocytic inclusions, similar to the [[May-Hegglin anomaly]].
* Diffuse [[leiomyomatosis]] of [[esophagus]] or [[female genitalia]], or both.

The use of eye examinations for screening has been proposed.<ref name="pmid18343956">{{cite journal |author=Zhang KW, Colville D, Tan R, ''et al.'' |title=The use of ocular abnormalities to diagnose X-linked Alport syndrome in children |journal=Pediatr. Nephrol. |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=1245–50 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18343956 |doi=10.1007/s00467-008-0759-4}}</ref>

A review of pathogenic mutations detected in X-linked Alport syndrome patients in 2011, recommended COL4A5 analysis in any patient meeting at least two clinical diagnostic criteria and that COL4A3 and COL4A4 analysis should be considered if a COL4A5 mutation is not detected and primarily if autosomal inheritance is suspected. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Hanson H, Storey H, Pagan J, Flinter F.|title=The Value of Clinical Criteria in Identifying Patients with X-Linked Alport Syndrome |journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=198–203 |year=2011 |pmid=20884774 |doi=}}</ref>

=== Immunohistochemistry ===
Immunohistochemical (IHC) evidence of the X-linked form Alport syndrome may be obtained from biopsies of either the skin or the renal glomerulus. In this processes, antibodies are used to detect the presence or absence of the alpha3, alpha4, and alpha5 chains of collagen type 4.

All three of these alpha chains are present in the glomerular basement membrane of normal individuals. In individuals expressing the X-linked form of Alport's syndrome, however, the presence of the dysfunctional alpha5 chain causes the assembly of the entire collagen 4 complex to fail, and ''none'' of these three chains will be detectable in either the glomerular or the renal tubular basement membrane.<ref name=Robbins988>{{cite book|last=Fausto|first=[ed. by] Vinay Kumar; Abul K. Abbas; Nelson|title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease.|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-7216-0187-1|pages=988|edition=7th }}</ref> 

Of these three alpha chains, only alpha5 is normally expressed in the skin,{{fact|date=October 2011}} so the hallmark of X-linked Alport syndrome on a skin biopsy is the absence of alpha5 staining.<ref name=Robbins988 />

==Treatment==
As there is no known cure for the condition, treatments are symptomatic. Patients are advised on how to manage the complications of kidney failure and the [[proteinuria]] that develops is often treated with [[ACE inhibitors]], although they are not always used simply for the elevated blood pressure.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|238260|Alport Syndrome|treatment}}</ref>

Once kidney failure has developed, patients are given [[dialysis]] or can benefit from a kidney transplant, although this can cause problems. The body may reject the new kidney as it contains normal type IV collagen, which may be recognized as foreign by the immune system.<ref>http://www.edren.org/pages/edreninfo/alport-syndrome.php</ref>

[[Gene therapy]] as a possible treatment option has been discussed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tryggvason K, Heikkilä P, Pettersson E, Tibell A, Thorner P |title=Can Alport syndrome be treated by gene therapy? |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=1493–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9150464|doi=10.1038/ki.1997.205}}</ref>
