'''Myopia''' ({{lang-el|μυωπία}}, ''muōpia'', from myein "to shut" – ops (gen. opos) "eye"<ref>{{OEtymD|myopia}}</ref>), commonly known as being '''nearsighted''' ([[American English]]) and '''shortsighted''' ([[British English]]), is a condition of the eye where the light that comes in does not directly focus on the retina but in front of it. This causes the image that one sees when looking at a distant object to be out of focus, but in focus when looking at a close object.

[[Eye care professional]]s most commonly correct myopia through the use of [[corrective lens]]es, such as [[glasses]] or [[contact lens]]es. It may also be corrected by [[refractive surgery]], though there are cases of associated side effects. The corrective [[lens (optics)|lenses]] have a negative [[optical power]] (''i.e.'' have a net [[concave lens|concave]] effect) which compensates for the excessive positive [[diopter]]s of the myopic eye.

Elevation of blood-glucose levels can also cause edema (swelling) of the [[crystalline lens]] as a result of [[sorbitol]] ([[sugar alcohol]]) accumulating in the lens. This edema often causes temporary myopia (nearsightedness).

*'''Degenerative myopia''', also known as malignant, pathological, or progressive myopia, is characterized by marked [[Fundus (eye)|fundus]] changes, such as posterior [[staphyloma]], and associated with a high refractive error and subnormal visual acuity after correction.<ref name="Cline"/> This form of myopia gets progressively worse over time.

*'''Nocturnal myopia''', also known as night or twilight myopia, is a condition in which the eye has a greater difficulty seeing in low-illumination areas, even though its daytime vision is normal. Essentially, the eye's far point of an individual's focus varies with the level of light. Night myopia is believed to be caused by pupils dilating to let more light in, which adds aberrations, resulting in becoming more nearsighted. A stronger prescription for myopic night drivers is often needed. Younger people are more likely to be affected by night myopia than the elderly.<ref>The Eyecare Trust.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Double image|Right|Human_eyesight_two_children_and_ball_with_myopia.jpg|200|Human eyesight two children and ball normal vision color.jpg|200|Near-sighted vision (''left''), normal vision (''right'')||}}
Myopia presents with blurry distance vision, but generally gives good near vision. In high myopia, even near vision is affected as objects must be extremely close to the eyes to see clearly, and patients cannot read without their glasses prescribed for distance.

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis of myopia is typically confirmed during an [[eye examination]] performed by a specialized doctor, the [[ophthalmologist]], or by an [[optometrist]] or [[orthoptist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070903142002/http://www.ranzco.edu/orthoptists-and-prescribing-in-nsw/view?searchterm=None |title=Orthoptists and Prescribing in NSW, VIC and SA |publisher=The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists|accessdate=29 July 2010}}</ref> Frequently an [[autorefractor]] or [[retinoscope]] is used to give an initial objective assessment of the refractive status of each eye, then a [[phoropter]] is used to subjectively refine the patient's [[eyeglass prescription]].

==Prevention==
The National Institutes of Health says there is no known way of preventing myopia, and the use of glasses or contact lenses does not affect its progression.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001023.htm Nearsightedness]. National Institutes of Health. 2010.</ref> There is no universally accepted method of preventing myopia; proposed procedures have not been studied for effectiveness.<ref name="AOA"/> 

Commonly attempted preventive methods include wearing reading glasses, eye drops and participating in more outdoor activities as described below.  Some clinicians and researchers recommend plus power (convex) lenses in the form of reading glasses when engaged in close work or reading  instead of using single focal [[concave lens]] glasses commonly prescribed.<ref name="AOA"/> The reasoning behind a convex lens's possible effectiveness in preventing myopia is simple to understand: Convex lenses' refractive property of converging light are used in reading glasses to help reduce the [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] needed when reading and doing close work. Although accommodation is irrelevant in Medina's quantitative model of myopia, it reaches the same conclusion. The model teaches a very simple method to prevent myopia.<ref name=Medina>{{cite pmid|3425264}}</ref>

For people with [[presbyopia]], whose eyes' lenses can not accommodate enough for very near focus, reading glasses help converge the light before it enters the eye to complement the refractive power of the [[eye lens]], so near objects focus clearly on the retina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aoa.org/x4697.xml |title=Presbyopia |publisher=Aoa.org |date= |accessdate=29 July 2010}}</ref>  By reducing the focusing effort needed ([[accommodation (eye)|accommodation]]), reading glasses or convex lenses essentially relax the focusing [[ciliary muscles]] and may consequently reduce chances of developing myopia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aoa.org/myopia.xml#1 |title=Myopia (Nearsightedness) |publisher=Aoa.org |date= |accessdate=29 July 2010}}</ref>  Inexpensive nonprescription reading glasses are commonly sold in drug stores and dollar stores.  Alternatively, reading glasses fitted by [[optometrists]] have a wider range of styles and lens choices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutvision.com/over40/readers.htm |title=Reading Glasses: What You Should Know |publisher=AllAboutVision.com |date= |accessdate=29 July 2010}}</ref>

==Management==
[[File:Briller2.JPG|right|thumb|Glasses are commonly used to address near-sightedness.]]
[[File:Myopia.svg|thumb|Compensating for myopia using a corrective lens.]]
[[Eyeglasses]], [[contact lenses]], and [[refractive surgery]] are the primary options to treat the visual symptoms of those with myopia. [[Intraocular lens#Intraocular lenses for correcting refractive errors|Lens implants]] are now available offering an alternative to glasses or contact lenses for myopics for whom laser surgery is not an option. [[Orthokeratology]] is the practice of using special rigid contact lenses to flatten the cornea to reduce myopia. Occasionally, [[pinhole glasses]] are used by patients with low-level myopia. These work by reducing the blur circle formed on the retina, but their adverse effects on peripheral vision, contrast and brightness make them unsuitable in most situations.

Glasses may have the potential to make the eyes worse, as they increase the accommodation needed by the eyes to focus.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Evidence of this can be seen when people with higher prescriptions have a harder time with activities like reading because their eyes grow tired faster.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Stronger prescriptions require a higher [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] by the eyes to focus through them, which can, over time, worsen eyesight, requiring yet another prescription, in a continuous but quickening cycle.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Contact lenses]] of equivalent prescription may not result in the same effect as eyeglasses, as they are closer to the eyes and may require less accommodation.<ref name="Morgan, 1">{{cite journal |author=Morgan I, Rose K |title=How genetic is school myopia? |journal=Prog Retin Eye Res |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=1–39 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15555525 |doi=10.1016/j.preteyeres.2004.06.004 }}</ref> This form of myopia is attributed to the use of the eyes for close work during the school years.<ref name="Cline"/>

Glasses work by using optical [[lenses]] bringing the image a viewer closer so that it can be focused by their myopic eyes. Large amounts of near work while wearing glasses can be very detrimental to the eyes and can be a cause of worsening nearsightedness.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} However, the [[eyestrain]] caused by not wearing glasses when they are needed can also be a risk factor. The best way to avoid needing new lenses is by reducing the amount of near work, which forces the eyes into a continuous near-focusing position that eventually causes or increases myopia, by taking frequent breaks from near work, and by only wearing glasses when they are needed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Reading glasses]] can also be worn during near work to decrease the strain on the eye, especially when already wearing corrective lenses, as they work in the opposite fashion to normal lenses.<ref name="pmid10416930">{{cite journal |author=Ong E, Grice K, Held R, Thorn F, Gwiazda J |title=Effects of spectacle intervention on the progression of myopia in children |journal=Optom Vis Sci |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=363–9 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10416930 |doi= 10.1097/00006324-199906000-00015}}</ref> Using this practice may have the potential to prevent nearsightedness or slow its progression.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Strong eyeglasses===

For people with a high degree of myopia, very strong eyeglass prescriptions are needed to correct the focus error. However, strong eyeglass prescriptions have a negative side effect in that off-axis viewing of objects away from the center of the lens results in prismatic movement and separation of colors, known as [[chromatic aberration]]. This prismatic distortion is visible to the wearer as color fringes around strongly contrasting colors. The fringes move around as the wearer's gaze through the lenses changes, and the prismatic shifting reverses on either side, above, and below the exact center of the lenses. Color fringing can make accurate drawing and painting difficult for users of strong eyeglass prescriptions.

Strongly nearsighted wearers of [[contact lenses]] do not experience chromatic aberration because the lens moves with the cornea and always stays centered in the middle of the wearer's gaze.

===Myopia control===

===Education and IQ===
A number of studies have shown the incidence of myopia increases with level of education,<ref name="Sperduto"/><ref name="Mavracanas"/> and many studies<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=mNT577S8uywC&pg=PA24 |title=Myopia and nearwork |author=Rosenfield, Mark and Gilmartin, Bernard |page=23 |publisher= Elsevier Health Sciences |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7506-3784-8}}</ref> have shown a correlation between myopia and a higher [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ).

A 2008 literature review reported studies in several nations have found a relationship between myopia and higher IQ and between myopia and school achievement. A common explanation for myopia is near-work. Regarding the relationship to IQ, several explanations have been proposed. One is that the myopic child is better adapted at reading, and reads and studies more, which increases intelligence. The reverse explanation is that the intelligent and studious child reads more, which causes myopia. Still another explanation is that [[pleiotropic]] gene(s) affect the size of both brain and eyes simultaneously. According to the two most recent studies, higher IQ may be associated with myopia in schoolchildren, independent of books read per week.<ref>{{cite pmid|19127804}}</ref>

Other personal characteristics, such as value systems, school achievements, time spent in reading for pleasure, language abilities and time spent in sport activities correlated to the occurrence of myopia in studies.<ref name="Beedle et al.">{{cite pmid|998715}}</ref><ref name="Mutti et al."/><ref>{{cite pmid|18413523}}</ref>

===Other risk factors===
[[Heredity]] appears as an important factor associated with juvenile myopia, with smaller contributions from more near work, higher school achievement and less time in sports activity.<ref name="Mutti et al.">{{cite pmid|12454029}}</ref>

== Myopia as metaphor ==
The terms "myopia" and "myopic" (or the common terms "shortsightedness" or "shortsighted", respectively) have been used [[metaphor]]ically to refer to cognitive thinking and decision making that is narrow in scope or lacking in foresight or in concern for wider interests or for longer-term consequences.<ref>Brooks, David (19 March 2009). [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/opinion/20brooks.html?_r=1&ref=opinion "Perverse Cosmic Myopia"]. New York Times.</ref> It is often used to describe a decision that may be beneficial in the present, but detrimental in the future, or a viewpoint that fails to consider anything outside a very narrow and limited range. [[Hyperopia]], the biological opposite of myopia, may also be used metaphorically for a [[value system]] or [[motivation]] that exhibits "farsighted" or possibly [[visionary]] thinking and behavior; that is, emphasizing long-term interests at the apparent expense of near-term benefit.<ref>{{cite news|work=Wired|url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/magazine/17-08/by_work|accessdate=14 August 2009|last=Thompson|first=Clive|volume=17|number=08|date=17 September 2009|title=Don't Work All the Time}}</ref>

==Research==
Normally eye development is largely genetically controlled, but it has been shown that the visual environment is an important factor in determining ocular development.

===Genetic basis for myopia===
Genetically, [[Genetic linkage|linkage]] studies have identified 18 possible loci on 15 different chromosomes that are associated with myopia, but none of these loci are part of the candidate genes that cause myopia. Instead of a simple one-gene locus controlling the onset of myopia, a complex interaction of many mutated proteins acting in concert may be the cause. Instead of myopia being caused by a defect in a structural protein, defects in the control of these structural proteins might be the actual cause of myopia.<ref>{{cite pmid|20036825}}</ref> A collaboration of all myopia studies worldwide, identified 16 new loci for refractive error in individuals of European ancestry, of which 8 were shared with Asians. The new loci include candidate genes with functions in neurotransmission, ion transport, retinoic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and eye development. The carriers of the high-risk genes have a tenfold increased risk of myopia.<ref>{{cite pmid|23396134}}</ref>

===Visual environment===
To induce myopia in lower as well as higher vertebrates, translucent goggles can be sutured over the eye, either before or after natural eye opening.<ref>{{cite pmid|15851585}}</ref> Form-deprived myopia (FDM) induced with a diffuser, like the goggles mentioned, shows significant myopic shifts.<ref>{{cite pmid|20137422}}</ref> Anatomically, the changes in axial length of the eye seem to be the major factor contributing to this type of myopia.<ref>{{cite pmid|12506052}}</ref> Diurnal growth rhythms of the eye have also been shown to play a large part in FDM. Chemically, daytime retinal dopamine levels drop about 30%.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite pmid|20370468}}</ref>

Normal eyes grow during the day and shrink during the night, but occluded eyes are shown to grow both during the day and the night. Because of this, FDM is a result of the lack of growth inhibition at night rather than the expected excessive growth during the day, when the actual light deprivation occurred.<ref>{{cite pmid|8510054}}</ref> Elevated levels of retinal dopamine transporter (which is directly involved in controlling retinal dopamine levels) in the RPE have been shown to be associated with FDM.<ref>{{cite pmid|12150736}}</ref>

===Dopamine===
[[Dopamine]] is a major [[neurotransmitter]] in the retina involved in signal transmission in the visual system. In the retinal inner nuclear layer, a dopaminergic neuronal network has been visualized in amacrine cells. Also, retinal dopamine is involved in the regulation of electrical coupling between horizontal cells and the retinomotor movement of [[photoreceptor cell]]s.<ref>{{cite pmid|7533830}}</ref>
Although FDM-related elongations in axial length and drops in dopamine levels are significant, after the diffuser is removed, a complete refraction recovery is seen within four days in some laboratory mice. Although significant, what is even more intriguing is that within just two days of diffuser removal, an early rise and eventual normalization of retinal dopamine levels in the eye are seen. This suggests dopamine participates in visually guided eye growth regulation, and these fluctuations are not just a response to the FDM.<ref>{{cite pmid|9068946}}</ref>

L-Dopa has been shown to re-establish circadian rhythms in animals whose circadian rhythms have been abolished. Dopamine, a major metabolite of levodopa, releases in response to light, and helps establish circadian clocks that drive daily rhythms of protein phosphorylation in photoreceptor cells. Because retinal dopamine levels are controlled on a circadian pattern, intravitreal injection of L-dopa in animals that have lost dopamine and circadian rhythms has been shown to correct these patterns, especially in heart rate, temperature, and locomotor activity.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  The occluders block light completely for the animals, which does not allow them to establish correct circadian rhythms, which leads to dopamine depletion. This depletion can be rectified with injections of L-dopa and hopefully contribute to the recovery from FDM.

*'''L-Dopa metabolism''' is important to consider due to its extensive presystemic metabolism, rapid absorption in the proximal small intestine and short plasma half-life. The major metabolites of L-dopa are dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid, and 3-O-methyldopa and 3-methoxytyramine.<ref>{{cite pmid|20384552}}</ref> Levodopa can be converted into dopamine in the presence of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (L-AAAD).<ref>{{cite pmid|7595534}}</ref> L-AAAD activity in rat retinas is modulated by environmental light,<ref>{{cite pmid|3139836}}</ref>  and this modulation is associated with dopamine D1 receptors<ref>{{cite pmid|2137529}}</ref> and alpha 2 adrenoceptors.<ref>{{cite pmid|2536080}}</ref>  Also, the synthesis and release of dopamine are light dependent, and light accelerates the formation of dopamine from exogenous L-Dopa.

*'''Past treatments''' with dopamine has been used as the gold-standard drug in the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]] and low-dose administration of the drug has been the most effective treatment of Parkinson’s. Possible treatments involving dopamine in preventing a decrease in visual acuity have been shown to be successful in the past.  L-Dopa treatment in children with amblyopia showed an improvement in visual acuity.<ref>{{cite pmid|12458842}}</ref>  In rabbits, injections of dopamine prevented the myopic shift and vitreous chamber and axial elongation typically associated with FDM.<ref>{{cite pmid|16550409}}</ref> In guinea pigs, systemic L-dopa has been shown to inhibit the myopic shift associated with FDM, and has compensated for the drop in retinal dopamine levels.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite pmid|19901858}}</ref> These experiments show promise in treating myopia in humans.

*'''Side effects''' of L-dopa have been experimentally determined. L-Dopa and some of its metabolites have been shown to have pro-oxidant properties, and oxidative stress has been shown to increase the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.<ref>{{cite pmid|10468218}}</ref> This promotion of free-radical formation by L-dopa does seem to directly affect its possible future treatment of myopia because free-radicals could cause further damage to those proteins responsible for controlling structural proteins in the eye. Levodopa and some of its metabolites such as dopa/dopamine quinone have also been shown to be toxic for nigral neurons.<ref>{{cite pmid|19131041}}</ref> This toxic effect must be analyzed before treatment with levodopa for myopia to prevent damaging effects to these neurons.

===L-Dopa inhibits myopic shifts===
In guinea pigs, intraperitoneal injections of L-dopa have shown to inhibit the myopic shift associated with FDM and have compensated to the drop in retinal dopamine levels. In this study specifically, 60 animals were used and the L-dopa treatments inhibited the myopic shift (from −3.62 ± 0.98 D to −1.50 ± 0.38 D; p < 0.001) due to goggles occluding and compensated retinal dopamine (from 0.65 ± 0.10&nbsp;ng to 1.33 ± 0.23&nbsp;ng; p < 0.001). Daily L-dopa (10&nbsp;mg/kg) was shown to increase the dopamine content in striatum. The axial length and retinal dopamine changes were positively correlated in the normal control eyes, deprived eyes, and L-dopa-treated deprived eyes. The increase in retinal dopamine and subsequent retardation of myopia may be associated with the fact that exogenous L-dopa was converted into dopamine. This suggests retinal dopaminergic function in the development of form-deprivation myopia in guinea pigs. The inhibitory effect of L-dopa on FDM may be associated with the fact that retinal L-AAAD can convert it into dopamine to balance the deficiency in the retina of the deprived eyes.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
*'''Areas of future research''' include intraperitoneal injection of L-dopa; its use at 10&nbsp;mg/kg could not completely suppress the development of form-deprivation myopia. Perhaps the dose may be too low to completely suppress myopia.  Another possibility of the incomplete suppression of myopia may be because it is a complex process, and retinal dopamine content is only one factor. It is also unclear whether systemic application of L-dopa is able to suppress the development of form-deprivation myopia.
