'''Therapygenetics''' refers to a branch of psychiatric genetic research looking at the relationship between specific genetic variants and differences in the level of success of psychological therapy.

==Background==

Thalia Eley and her research team coined the term in 2011.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eley TC, Hudson JL, Creswell C, ''et al.'' |title=Therapygenetics: the 5HTTLPR and response to psychological therapy |journal=Mol. Psychiatry |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=236–7 |year=2012 |month=March |pmid=22024766 |pmc=3272476 |doi=10.1038/mp.2011.132 |url= http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v17/n3/full/mp2011132a.html }}</ref> The field is parallel to [[pharmacogenetics]], which explores the association between specific genetic variants and the efficacy of psychiatric drug treatments. Therapygenetics work also relates to the [[differential susceptibility hypothesis]] <ref>{{cite journal |author=Belsky J, Jonassaint C, Pluess M, Stanton M, Brummett B, Williams R |title=Vulnerability genes or plasticity genes? |journal=Mol. Psychiatry |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=746–54 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19455150 |pmc=2834322 |doi=10.1038/mp.2009.44 }}</ref> which proposes that individuals have a [[genetic predisposition]] to respond to a greater or lesser extent to their environment, be it positive or negative.

==History==
The 2011 paper marked the first use of the term, although previous studies looking for associations between specific genetic variants and response to psychological therapy were conducted.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lonsdorf TB, Rück C, Bergström J, ''et al.'' |title=The COMTval158met polymorphism is associated with symptom relief during exposure-based cognitive-behavioral treatment in panic disorder |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=10 |issue= |pages=99 |year=2010 |pmid=21110842 |pmc=3004861 |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-10-99 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Steiger H, Joober R, Gauvin L, ''et al.'' |title=Serotonin-system polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR and -1438G/A) and responses of patients with bulimic syndromes to multimodal treatments |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=69 |issue=10 |pages=1565–71 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=19192439 }}</ref>  The study used data collected from 359 children from Reading, UK, and Sydney, Australia. Analyses showed that a variation in the Serotonin Transporter Promotor Polymorphism ([[5HTTLPR]]) – previously associated with anxiety and response to stress<ref>{{cite journal |author=Caspi A, Hariri AR, Holmes A, Uher R, Moffitt TE |title=Genetic sensitivity to the environment: the case of the serotonin transporter gene and its implications for studying complex diseases and traits |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=167 |issue=5 |pages=509–27 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20231323 |pmc=2943341 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09101452}}</ref>– correlated with the efficacy of [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT), a common treatment method for [[anxiety disorder]]s. Those with the shorter version of this polymorphism were 20% more likely to be free of their anxiety disorder when assessed at follow-up, several months after the end of treatment with CBT. These individuals also showed a greater reduction in symptoms over the period of treatment.

==Research directions==

Beevers and McGeary reviewed the concept and its research, giving their support for the future of therapygenetics research as a means of enhancing the efficacy of psychological treatments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Beevers|first=CG|coauthors=McGeary JE |title=Therapygenetics: moving towards personalized psychotherapy treatment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2012 |volume=16|issue=1|pages=11–12|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2011.11.004|pmid=22104133|pmc=3253222}}</ref> Eley et al. are exploring therapygenetics in relation to [[anxiety]]. There is scope for this form of research across disorders and treatments. It is hoped that this type of work may eventually inform personalised treatment, decreasing treatment time and improving the mental health of those with psychiatric conditions.

The following year we extended our focus to a single nucleotide polymorphism in the [[Nerve Growth Factor]] gene (NGF rs6330) and [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF rs6265).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lester KJ, Hudson JL, Tropeano M, Creswell C, Collier DA, Farmer A, Lyneham HJ, Rapee RM, Eley TC |title=Neurotrophic gene polymorphisms and response to psychological therapy |journal=Trans Psychiatry |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=11–2 |year=2012 |month=January |pmc=3365252|doi=10.1038/tp.2012.33}}</ref> Both genes are implicated in synaptic plasticity, response to stress and are widely expressed in brain areas involved in mood and cognition. Analyses showed no significant association between response to CBT and the polymorphism within the BDNF gene. For the NGF polymorphism, those with one or more copies of the T allele were significantly more likely to be free of their anxiety disorder when assessed at follow-up. These effects remained even when other clinically relevant covariates were accounted for.

A [http://www.biolmoodanxietydisord.com/content/3/1/4 2013 article] reviewed recent work in the therapygenetics field focusing on the role that genes play in predicting response to psychological treatments for anxiety and mood disorders. The review found that although the field of therapygenetics is in its infancy, several studies have provided early promising evidence that genetic differences between individuals are capable of predicting differential susceptibility to psychotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lester|first=KJ|coauthors=Eley TC|title= Therapygenetics: Using genetic markers to predict response to psychological treatment for mood and anxiety disorders |journal= Biology of mood & anxiety disorders |year=2013|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi= 10.1186/2045-5380-3-4 |pmid=23388219|pmc=3575379}}</ref>
