{{About|the baby pacifier}}

[[Image:Schnuller.JPG|thumb|right|A pacifier]]
A '''pacifier''' (North American English), '''dummy''' (Britain and other Commonwealth countries), '''binky''', or '''soother''' (in some countries) is a [[rubber]], [[plastic]], or [[silicone]] [[nipple]] given to an [[infant]] or other young child to suck upon. In its standard appearance it has a [[teat]], mouth shield, and handle. The mouth shield and/or the handle is large enough to avoid the danger of the child [[Choking#Foreign objects|choking]] on it or [[swallowing]] it.

==History==
[[Image:Baby Comforter 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Baby Comforter design – 1900]]
The original "pacifier" was actually a corn cob, which was found to soothe a young baby by the wife of a farmer in 1680's England. The corn cob worked as a nice replacement for the mother's sore nipple, and it helped the baby to relax and fall asleep. In fact, in England in the 17th–19th centuries, a ''coral'' meant a teething toy made of coral, ivory or bone, often mounted in silver as the handle of a rattle.<ref>

Pacifiers were a development of hard [[teething ring]]s, but they were also a substitute for the softer ''[[sugar tit]]s'', ''sugar-teats'' or ''sugar-rags''<ref>
''Oxford English Dictionary''
</ref> which had been in use in 19th century America. A writer in 1873 described a "sugar-teat" made from "a small piece of old linen" with a "spoonful of rather sandy sugar in the center of it", "gathered ... up into a little ball" with a thread tied tightly around it.<ref>Jamieson, Cecilia Viets (1873) [http://www.letrs.indiana.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=wright2;cc=wright2;sid=7be904423dbfa3d5f5839509345adcdf;tpl=home.tpl ''Ropes of Sand''].

In some places a lump of meat or fat was tied in cloth, and sometimes the rag was moistened with brandy. German-speaking areas might use ''Lutschbeutel'': cloth wrapped round sweetened bread, or maybe poppy-seeds.

Pacifiers were settling into their modern form around 1900 when the first teat, shield and handle design was patented in the US as a "baby comforter".<ref>

In 1902 [[Sears Roebuck]] advertised a "new style rubber teething ring, with one hard and one soft nipple",<ref name=r1/> and in 1909 someone calling herself "Auntie Pacifier" wrote to the ''New York Times'' to warn of the "menace to health" (she meant dental health) of "the persistent, and, among poorer classes, the universal sucking of a rubber nipple sold as a 'pacifier'."<ref>Auntie Pacifier (July 2, 1909)

</ref> In England too, dummies were seen as something the "poorer classes" would use, and associated with poor hygiene. In 1914 a [[London]] doctor complained about "the dummy teat": "If it falls on the floor it is rubbed momentarily on the mother's blouse or apron, lipped by the mother and replaced in the baby's mouth."<ref>[http://rcnarchive.rcn.org.uk/data/VOLUME055-1915/page123-volume55-07thaugust1915.pdf '&#39;British Journal of Nursing: The Midwife'&#39; Aug 7 1915].

Early pacifiers were manufactured with a choice of black, maroon or white rubber, though the white rubber of the day contained a certain amount of lead. ''Binky'' (with a ''y'') was first used as a brand name for pacifiers and other baby products in about 1935 and is currently owned by Playtex Products, Inc. as a trademark in the U.S. (and a number of other countries).<ref>[http://www.uspto.gov/main/search.html According to trademark registration documents 1948].

==Drawbacks==
[[Image:BabySuckingFingers.jpg||thumb|Infants may use a pacifier, their thumbs or fingers to soothe themselves]]

Pacifiers have been shown to interfere with [[breastfeeding]], especially if introduced within the first 6 weeks of life.<ref name="Sanches_2004">

Some older infants may have delayed speech development due to the pacifier's constant presence in their mouths preventing them from practicing their speaking skills.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

One study revealed that sucking habits, including the use of a pacifier, increased the chance of dental problems. "Results indicate that the prevalence of crossbite in the molar area steadily increased from 5.8 percent for children who stopped the habit by one year of age, to 13 percent among children who stopped between two and three years old, to more than 20 percent for those who continued the habit after they turned four years old." <ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/12/011224083205.htm Thumb-Sucking, Pacifier Use May Damage Children's Teeth].

Retrieved on 2013-04-14.</ref> The study also revealed: "...children who continue to suck a thumb, finger or pacifier past age two increase their risk of developing protruding front teeth."

==Benefits==
Researchers have found that use of a pacifier is associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]] (Sudden infant death syndrome).<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/12/051208231745.htm Report in '&#39;Science Daily'&#39;].

It is commonly reported anecdotally that dummy use among stimulant users helps reduce [[bruxism]] and thus prevents tooth damage.

==Medical policies==
The [[American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry]]'s "Policy on Thumb, Finger and Pacifier Habits" says: "Most children stop sucking on thumbs, pacifiers or other objects on their own between 2 and 4 years of age. However, some children continue these habits over long periods of time. In these children, the upper front teeth may tip toward the lip or not come in properly. Frequent or intense habits over a prolonged period of time can affect the way the child's teeth bite together, as well as the growth of the jaws and bones that support the teeth."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080201005753/http://www.aapd.org/publications/brochures/tfphabits.asp Thumb, Finger and Pacifier Habits]. American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. aapd.org</ref>

A study of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) states that "It seems appropriate to stop discouraging the use of pacifiers." The authors recommend the use of pacifiers at nap time and bedtime throughout the first year of life. For breastfeeding mothers, the authors suggest waiting until breastfeeding is well established, typically for several weeks, before introducing the pacifier.<ref name="Mitchell_2005">

The British Dental Health Foundation recommends: "If you can, avoid using a dummy and discourage thumb sucking. These can both eventually cause problems with how the teeth grow and develop. And this may need treatment with a brace when the child gets older."<ref>[http://www.dentalhealth.org.uk/faqs/leafletdetail.php?LeafletID=23 Dental care for mother and baby]. dentalhealth.org.uk</ref>

==Adult pacifiers==
[[File:NUK 5 adult pacifier.jpg|thumb|right|A NUK 5 pacifier]]

Adult-sized pacifiers, consisting of a standard baby pacifier guard but a larger, wider nipple, are used by some members of the [[Paraphilic infantilism|Adult Baby]] community. The nipples are often referred to as NUK5s, after the NUK brand of baby pacifiers manufactured by the German company MAPA GmbH. They are sold under the name NUK Medicpro L or NUK Size 5.

Recent studies have also shown that pacifier use among adults may cut down or completely eliminate snoring.<ref>[http://english.pravda.ru/science/tech/20-09-2004/7047-pacifier-0/ Baby pacifier – the best snoring remedy]. Pravda, September 20, 2004</ref>

At techno parties and [[raves]], standard children's dummies are a common sight, being both used and sold there; a common side effect of [[entactogen]] and [[stimulant]] drugs, often used by rave attendees, is [[bruxism]] (grinding of the teeth), which can result to damage to the teeth, [[mandible]], or tongue. The use of dummies, or, alternatively, [[chewing gum]], are anecdotally claimed to help prevent this.

==Prevalence of attachments to pacifiers and their psychological functions==

In the late 1970s researchers dispelled the notion that pacifiers were psychologically unhealthy and aberrant. Richard H. Passman and Jane S. Halonen at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee traced the developmental course of attachments to pacifiers and provided norms.<ref name="Passman, R. H. 1979">{{cite journal|author=Passman, R. H., & Halonen, J. S.|year=1979|title= A developmental survey of young children's attachments to inanimate objects|journal= Journal of Genetic Psychology|volume= 134|pages= 165–178|doi=10.1080/00221325.1979.10534051}}</ref> They found that 66% of their sample of three-month olds in the United States demonstrated at least some attachment, according to their mothers. At six months of age, this incidence was 40% and at nine months, 44%. Thereafter, the rate of attachment to pacifiers dropped precipitously until, at 24 months of age and later, it was quite rare. 

These researchers also provided experimental support for what were then only anecdotal observations that pacifiers do indeed pacify babies.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Halonen, J. S., & Passman, R. H. |year=1978|title= Pacifiers' effects upon play and separations from the mother for the one-year-old in a novel environment|journal= Infant Behavior and Development|volume= 1|pages= 70–78|doi=10.1016/S0163-6383(78)80010-1}}</ref> In an unfamiliar playroom, one-year-old infants accompanied by their pacifier evidenced more play and demonstrated less distress than did babies without them. The investigators concluded that pacifiers should be considered to be attachment objects, similar to other security objects like blankets.

Passman and Halonen <ref name="Passman, R. H. 1979"/> contended that the widespread occurrence of attachments to pacifiers as well as their importance as security objects should reassure parents that they are a normal part of development for a majority of infants.
