[[File:Southworth & Hawes - First etherized operation (re-enactment).jpg|thumb|Re-enactment of the first public demonstration of [[general anesthesia]] by [[William T. G. Morton]] on October 16, 1846 in the [[Ether Dome]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Boston]]. Surgeons [[John Collins Warren]] and [[Henry Jacob Bigelow]] are included in this [[daguerrotype]] by [[Southworth & Hawes]].]]

Attempts at producing a state of '''[[general anesthesia]]''' can be traced throughout [[recorded history]] in the writings of the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indians]], and [[History of China#Ancient era|Chinese]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], which correspond roughly to what is sometimes referred to as the [[Islamic Golden Age]], scientists and other scholars made significant advances in [[science in medieval Islam|science]] and [[Medicine in medieval Islam|medicine]] in the [[Muslim world]] and [[Eastern world]], while their European counterparts also made important advances.

The utopians [[Renaissance]] saw significant advances in [[anatomy]] and [[surgery|surgical technique]]. However, despite all this progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated [[pain]], many patients with surgical disorders chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although there has been a great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anesthesia, it is generally agreed that certain scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anesthetic techniques.

Two "quantum leaps" occurred in the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to [[Modernity|modern]] surgery. An appreciation of the [[germ theory of disease]] led rapidly to the development and application of [[antiseptic]] techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to [[asepsis]], reduced the overall [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in [[pharmacology]] and [[physiology]] which led to the development of general anesthesia and the control of pain.

In the 20th century, the safety and efficacy of general anesthesia was improved by the routine use of [[tracheal intubation]] and other advanced [[airway management]] techniques. Significant advances in [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] and new [[anesthetic|anesthetic agents]] with improved [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] and [[Pharmacodynamics|pharmacodynamic]] characteristics also contributed to this trend. Finally, standardized training programs for [[anesthesiologist]]s and [[nurse anesthetist]]s emerged during this period. And, of course, the increased application of economic and business administration principles to health care in the late 20th and early 21st centuries inevitably led to the introduction of management practices such as transfer pricing to improve the efficiency of anesthesists.<ref name=kuntz2005>{{cite journal|last1=Kuntz|first1=L|last2=Vera|first2=A|title=Transfer pricing in hospitals and efficiency of physicians: the case of anesthesia services|journal=Health Care Management Review|volume=30|issue=3|pages=262-69|year=2005|doi=10.1097/00004010-200507000-00010|pmid=16093892|url=}}</ref>

==Etymology of "anesthesia"==
The word "anesthesia", [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] (1809–1894) in 1846 from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αν-}}, ''an-'', "without"; and {{lang|grc|αἴσθησις}}, ''aisthēsis'', "sensation"),<ref name=Small1962/> refers to the inhibition of [[Sensation (psychology)|sensation]].

==Antiquity==
The first attempts at general anesthesia were probably [[herbalism|herbal remedies]] administered in [[prehistory]]. [[Ethanol|Alcohol]] is the oldest known [[sedative]]; it was used in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] thousands of years ago.<ref name=Powell1996/>

===Opium===
[[File:Illustration Papaver somniferum0.jpg|thumb|Opium poppy, ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'']]

It has long been written that the Sumerians cultivated and harvested the [[opium]] poppy (''[[Papaver somniferum]]'') in lower Mesopotamia as early as 3400 BC,<ref name=Neligan1927/><ref name=Booth1996/> though this has been disputed.<ref name=Krikorian1975/> The most ancient testimony concerning the opium poppy found to date was inscribed in [[cuneiform script]] on a small white clay tablet at the end of the third millennium BC.  This tablet was discovered in 1954 during excavations at [[Nippur]], and is currently kept at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]. Deciphered by [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] and Martin Leve, it is considered to be the most ancient [[pharmacopoeia]] in existence.<ref name=Kramer1954/><ref name=Kramer1988/> Some Sumerian tablets of this era have an [[ideogram]] inscribed upon them, "hul gil", which translates to "plant of joy", believed by some authors to refer to opium.<ref name=Terry1928/><ref name=Sonnedecker1962/> The term ''gil'' is still used for opium in certain parts of the world.<ref name=Anslinger1953/> The Sumerian goddess [[Nidaba]] is often depicted with poppies growing out of her shoulders.  About 2225 BC, the Sumerian territory became a part of the Babylonian empire. Knowledge and use of the opium poppy and its [[Euphoria|euphoric]] effects thus passed to the Babylonians, who expanded their empire eastwards to [[Iran|Persia]] and westwards to Egypt, thereby extending its range to these civilizations.<ref name=Anslinger1953/> British archaeologist and cuneiformist [[Reginald Campbell Thompson]] writes that opium was known to the Assyrians in the 7th century BC.<ref name=Thomson1924/> The term "Arat Pa Pa" occurs in the ''Assyrian [[Herbal]]'', a collection of inscribed Assyrian tablets dated to c. 650 BC. According to Thompson, this term is the Assyrian name for the juice of the poppy and it may be the [[etymology|etymological]] origin of the Latin "''[[papaver]]''".<ref name=Terry1928/>

The ancient Egyptians were known to have had some surgical instruments,<ref name=Ebers1889/><ref name=Pahor1992I/> as well as certain crude analgesics and sedatives, including possibly an extract prepared from the [[mandrake (plant)|mandrake]] fruit.<ref name=Sullivan1996/> The use of preparations similar to opium in surgery is recorded in the [[Ebers Papyrus]], an [[Egyptian medical papyri|Egyptian medical papyrus]] written in the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]].<ref name=Anslinger1953/><ref name=Ebers1889/><ref name=Ebbell1937/> However, it is questionable whether opium itself was known in ancient Egypt at that time.<ref name=Bisset1994/> The Greek gods [[Hypnos]] (Sleep), [[Nyx]] (Night), and [[Thanatos]] (Death) were often depicted holding poppies.<ref name=Kritikos1967-3/>

Prior to the introduction of opium to [[Indus Valley Civilization|ancient India]] and [[History of China#Ancient era|China]], these civilizations pioneered the use of [[cannabis]] [[incense]] and [[aconitum]]. c. 400 BC, the [[Sushruta Samhita]] (a text from the [[Indian subcontinent]] on [[Ayurveda|ayurvedic medicine]] and surgery) advocates the use of [[wine]] with incense of cannabis for anesthesia.<ref name=Sushruta/> By the 8th century AD, Arab traders had brought opium to India<ref name=Dwarakanath1965/> and China.<ref name=Fort1965/>

===China===
[[File:HuaTuo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hua Tuo]], Chinese [[surgeon]], c. AD 200]]

[[Bian Que]] ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: 扁鹊, [[Wade–Giles]]: ''Pien Ch'iao'', c. 300 BC) was a legendary Chinese [[Internal medicine|internist]] and surgeon who reportedly used general anesthesia for surgical procedures. It is recorded in the ''[[Han Feizi (book)|Book of Master Han Fei]]'' (c. 250 BC), the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (c. 100 BC), and the ''[[Liezi|Book of Master Lie]]'' (c. AD 300) that Bian Que gave two men, named "Lu" and "Chao", a toxic drink which rendered them unconscious for three days, during which time he performed a [[gastrostomy]] upon them.<ref name=Gordon1949/><ref name=Giles1912/><ref name=Salguero2009/>

[[Hua Tuo]] ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]:华佗， c. AD 145-220) was a Chinese [[surgeon]] of the 2nd century AD. According to the ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'' (c. AD 270) and the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' (c. AD 430), Hua Tuo performed surgery under general anesthesia using a formula he had developed by mixing wine with a mixture of [[herbal extract]]s he called ''[[Hua Tuo#Mafeisan|mafeisan]]'' (麻沸散).<ref name=Chu2004/> Hua Tuo reportedly used mafeisan to perform even major operations such as [[Segmental resection|resection]] of [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] [[intestines]].<ref name=Chu2004/><ref name=Giles1897/><ref name=Giles1948/> Before the surgery, he administered an oral anesthetic [[potion]], probably dissolved in wine, in order to induce a state of [[unconsciousness]] and partial [[Neuromuscular-blocking drug|neuromuscular blockade]].<ref name=Chu2004/>

The exact composition of mafeisan, similar to all of Hua Tuo's clinical knowledge, was lost when he burned his manuscripts, just before his death.<ref name=Chen2008/> The composition of the anesthetic powder was not mentioned in either the ''Records of Three Kingdoms'' or the ''Book of the Later Han''. Because [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings regarded the body as [[sacred]] and surgery was considered a form of body mutilation, surgery was strongly discouraged in [[History of China#Ancient era|ancient China]]. Because of this, despite Hua Tuo's reported success with general anesthesia, the practice of surgery in ancient China ended with his death.<ref name=Chu2004/>

The name ''mafeisan'' combines ''ma'' ([[Wikt:麻|麻]], meaning "cannabis, [[hemp]], [[Anesthesia|numbed]] or [[Paresthesia|tingling]]"), ''fei'' ([[Wikt:沸|沸]], meaning "[[boiling]] or bubbling"), and ''san'' ([[Wikt:散|散]], meaning "to break up or scatter", or "medicine in powder form"). Therefore, the word ''mafeisan'' probably means something like "cannabis boil powder". Many [[Sinology|sinologist]]s and scholars of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] have guessed at the composition of Hua Tuo's mafeisan powder, but the exact components still remain unclear. His formula is believed to have contained some combination of:<ref name=Chu2004/><ref name=Chen2008/><ref name=Wang1999/><ref name=Fu2002/>
*''bai zhi'' (''[[Chinese character|Chinese]]:白芷''，[[Angelica|Angelica dahurica]]''),
*''cao wu'' (''[[Chinese character|Chinese]]:草烏'', ''[[Wikispecies:Aconitum kusnezoffii|Aconitum kusnezoffii]]'', ''[[Aconitum|Aconitum kusnezoffii]]'', ''Kusnezoff's monkshood'', or ''wolfsbane'' root),
*''chuān xiōng'' (''[[Chinese character|Chinese]]:川芎，[[Ligusticum wallichii]]'', or ''Szechuan lovage''),
*''dong quai'' (''[[Chinese character|Chinese]]:当归'',''[[Angelica sinensis]]'', or ''"female [[ginseng]]"''),
*''wu tou'' (烏頭, ''[[Aconitum carmichaelii]], rhizome of ''Aconitum'', or Chinese monkshood"),
*''yang jin hua'' (洋金花, ''[[Wikispecies:Datura metel|Flos Daturae metelis]]'', or ''[[Datura stramonium]]'', ''jimson weed'', ''devil's trumpet'', ''thorn apple'', ''locoweed'', ''moonflower''),
*''ya pu lu'' (押不芦,''[[Mandragora officinarum]]'')
*[[rhododendron]] flower, and
*[[jasmine]] root.
Others have suggested the potion may have also contained [[hashish]],<ref name=Giles1897/> [[bhang]],<ref name=Giles1948/> ''shang-luh'',<ref name=Gordon1949/> or opium.<ref name=Veith1972/> [[Victor H. Mair]] wrote that ''mafei'' "appears to be a transcription of some [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word related to "morphine"."<ref name=Mair2000/> Some authors believe that Hua Tuo may have discovered surgical analgesia by [[acupuncture]], and that mafeisan either had nothing to do with or was simply an adjunct to his strategy for anesthesia.<ref name=Lu2002/> Many physicians have attempted to re-create the same formulation based on historical records but none have achieved the same clinical efficacy as Hua Tuo's. In any event, Hua Tuo's formula did not appear to be effective for major operations.<ref name=Mair2000/><ref name=Wai2004/>

Other substances used from antiquity for anesthetic purposes include extracts of [[juniper]] and [[coca]].<ref name=Carroll/><ref name=Peterson/><ref name=Rivera/>

==Middle Ages and Renaissance==

Arabic and Persian physicians may have been among the first to utilize oral as well as [[Inhalational anaesthetic|inhaled anesthetics]]. [[Ferdowsi]] (940–1020) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[poet]] who lived in the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. In ''[[Shahnameh]]'', his [[national epic]] poem, Ferdowsi described a [[caesarean section]] performed on [[Rudaba]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} A special wine prepared by a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] priest was used as an anesthetic for this operation.<ref name=Gordon1949/> Although ''Shahnameh'' is fictional, the passage nevertheless supports the idea that general anesthesia had at least been described in [[Iran#Middle Ages .28652.E2.80.931501.29|ancient Persia]], even if not successfully implemented.

In 1000, [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (936-1013), an Arab physician who lived in [[Al-Andalus]], published the 30-volume [[Al-Tasrif|''Kitab al-Tasrif'']], the first illustrated work on surgery.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In this book, he wrote about the use of general anesthesia for surgery. c. 1020, [[Avicenna|Ibn Sīnā]] (980–1037) described the use of inhaled anesthesia in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The ''Canon'' described the "soporific sponge", a [[Sponge (material)|sponge]] imbued with [[Aromaticity|aromatics]] and [[narcotic]]s, which was to be placed under a patient's nose during surgical operations.<ref name=Skinner2008/> [[Ibn Zuhr]] (1091–1161) was another Arab physician from Al-Andalus. In his 12th century medical textbook ''Al-Taisir'', Ibn Zuhr describes the use of general anesthesia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} These three physicians were among many who performed operations under inhaled anesthesia with the use of narcotic-soaked sponges.<ref name=Ajram1992/><ref name=Hunke1969/> Opium made its way from Asia Minor to all parts of Europe between the 10th and 13th centuries.<ref name=Kritikos1967-2/>

Throughout 1200 - 1500 A.D. in England, a potion called [[dwale (anaesthetic)|dwale]] was used as an anesthetic.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Anthony J.|date=18 December 1999|title=Dwale: an anaesthetic from old England|journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=319|issue=7225|pages=1623–1626|pmid=PMC1127089|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127089/|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>  This mixture contained [[bile]], [[opium]], [[lettuce]], [[bryony]], and [[Conium|hemlock]].<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> Due to the hemlock and the numerous other ingredients [[interacting]], the patient often died on the operating table.  However, in the unlikely event that the patient survived the operation, surgeons roused them by rubbing vinegar and salt on their cheekbones.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> One can find records of dwale in numerous literary sources, including [[Shakespeare's]] [[Hamlet]], and the [[John Keats]] poem [[Ode to a Nightingale]].<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>

[[Alchemy|Alchemist]] [[Ramon Llull]] has been credited with discovering [[diethyl ether]] in 1275.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} <ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493–1541), better known as [[Paracelsus]], discovered the [[analgesic]] properties of diethyl ether around 1525.<ref name=Gravenstein1965/> It was first synthesized in 1540 by [[Valerius Cordus]], who noted some of its medicinal properties.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} He called it ''oleum dulce vitrioli'', a name that reflects the fact that it is synthesized by distilling a mixture of ethanol and [[sulfuric acid]] (known at that time as oil of vitriol). [[August Sigmund Frobenius]] gave the name ''Spiritus Vini Æthereus'' to the substance in 1730.<ref name=Frobenius1730/><ref name=Mortimer1741/>

[[Joseph Priestley]] (1733–1804) was an English [[polymath]] who discovered [[nitrous oxide]], [[nitric oxide]], [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen chloride]] and (along with [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]]) [[oxygen]]. Beginning in 1775, Priestley published his research in ''[[Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air]]'', a six-volume work.<ref name=Priestley1775/> The recent discoveries about these and other [[gas]]es stimulated a great deal of interest in the European scientific community. [[Thomas Beddoes]] (1760–1808) was an English [[philosophy|philosopher]], physician and teacher of medicine, and like his older colleague Priestley, was also a member of the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]]. With an eye toward making further advances in this new science as well as offering treatment for diseases previously thought to be untreatable (such as [[asthma]] and [[tuberculosis]]), Beddoes founded the ''[[Pneumatic Institution]]'' for inhalation gas therapy in 1798 at [[Dowry Square]] in [[Clifton, Bristol]].<ref name=Levere1977>{{cite journal|last=Levere|first=TH|title=Dr. Thomas Beddoes and the establishment of his Pneumatic Institution: a tale of three presidents|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume=32|issue=1|pages=41–9|year=1977|pmid=11615622|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1977.0005|jstor=531764}}</ref> Beddoes employed [[chemist]] and physicist [[Humphry Davy]] (1778–1829) as superintendent of the institute, and [[engineer]] [[James Watt]] (1736–1819) to help manufacture the gases. Other members of the Lunar Society such as [[Erasmus Darwin]] and [[Josiah Wedgwood]] were also actively involved with the institute.

During the course of his research at the Pneumatic Institution, Davy discovered the anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide.<ref name=Sneader2005/> Davy, who coined the term "laughing gas" for nitrous oxide, published his findings the following year in the now-classic [[treatise]], ''Researches, chemical and philosophical–chiefly concerning nitrous oxide or dephlogisticated nitrous air, and its respiration''. Davy was not a physician, and he never administered nitrous oxide during a surgical procedure. He was however the first to document the analgesic effects of nitrous oxide, as well as its potential benefits in relieving pain during surgery:<ref name=Davy1800/>{{quote|"As ni­trous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying physical pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great effusion of blood takes place."}}

[[File:HanaokaSeishu.gif|thumb|[[Hanaoka Seishū]], Japanese surgeon of the 18th and 19th centuries]]

[[Hanaoka Seishū]] (華岡 青洲, 1760–1835) of [[Osaka]] was a Japanese surgeon of the [[Edo period]] with a knowledge of [[Chinese herbology|Chinese herbal medicine]], as well as Western surgical techniques he had learned through ''[[Rangaku]]'' (literally "Dutch learning", and by extension "Western learning"). Beginning in about 1785, Hanaoka embarked on a quest to re-create a compound that would have pharmacologic properties similar to Hua Tuo's mafeisan.<ref name=Izuo2004/> After years of research and experimentation, he finally developed a formula which he named ''tsūsensan'' (also known as ''mafutsu-san''). Like that of Hua Tuo, this compound was composed of extracts of several different plants, including:<ref name=Ogata1973/><ref name=Hyodo1992/><ref name=BLTC/>
*2 parts ''bai zhi'' (''[[Chinese character|Chinese]]:白芷''，''Angelica dahurica'');
*2 parts ''cao wu'' (''[[Chinese character|Chinese]]:草烏''，''Aconitum sp.'', ''monkshood'' or ''wolfsbane'');
*2 parts ''chuān ban xia'' (''[[Pinellia ternata]]'');
*2 parts ''chuān xiōng'' (''Ligusticum wallichii'', ''Cnidium rhizome'', ''Cnidium officinale'' or ''Szechuan lovage'');
*2 parts ''dong quai'' (''Angelica sinensis'' or ''female [[ginseng]]'');
*1 part ''tian nan xing'' (''[[Arisaema|Arisaema rhizomatum]]'' or ''cobra lily'')
*8 parts ''yang jin hua'' (''Datura stramonium'', ''Korean morning glory'', ''thorn apple'', ''jimson weed'', ''devil's trumpet'', ''stinkweed'', or ''locoweed'').
The reader will note that five of these seven ingredients were thought to be elements of Hua Tuo's anesthetic potion, 1600 years earlier. Some sources claim that ''[[Garden Angelica|Angelica archangelica]]'' (often referred to as ''garden angelica'', ''holy ghost'', or ''wild celery'') was also an ingredient.

The active ingredients in tsūsensan are [[scopolamine]], [[hyoscyamine]], [[atropine]], [[aconitine]] and [[angelicotoxin]]. When consumed in sufficient quantity, tsūsensan produces a state of general anesthesia and [[skeletal muscle]] [[paralysis]].<ref name=BLTC/> [[Shutei Nakagawa]] (1773–1850), a close friend of Hanaoka, wrote a small pamphlet entitled "Mayaku-ko" ("narcotic powder") in 1796. Although the original manuscript was lost in a fire in 1867, this brochure described the current state of Hanaoka's research on general anesthesia.<ref name=Matsuki1999/>

On 13 October 1804, Hanaoka performed a partial [[mastectomy]] for [[breast cancer]] on a 60 year old woman named Kan Aiya, using tsūsensan as a [[general anesthetic]]. This is generally regarded today as the first reliable documentation of an operation to be performed under general anesthesia.<ref name=Izuo2004/><ref name=Hyodo1992/><ref name=Perrin1979/><ref name=Matsuki2000/> Hanaoka went on to perform many operations using tsūsensan, including resection of [[malignancy|malignant]] [[tumor]]s, extraction of [[Urolithiasis|bladder stones]], and extremity [[amputation]]s. Before his death in 1835, Hanaoka performed more than 150 operations for breast cancer.<ref name=Izuo2004/><ref name=Matsuki2000/><ref name=Tominaga1994/><ref name=Matsuki2002/>

[[Friedrich Sertürner]] (1783–1841) first isolated [[morphine]] from [[opium]] in 1804;<ref name=Meyer2004/> he named it morphine after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams.<ref name=Serturner1806/><ref name=Serturner1817/>

[[Henry Hill Hickman]] (1800–1830) experimented with the use of [[carbon dioxide]] as an anesthetic in the 1820s. He would make the animal insensible, effectively via almost suffocating it with carbon dioxide, then determine the effects of the gas by amputating one of its limbs. In 1824, Hickman submitted the results of his research to the [[Royal Society]] in a short treatise entitled ''Letter on suspended animation: with the view of ascertaining its probable utility in surgical operations on human subjects''. The response was an 1826 article in [[The Lancet]] titled 'Surgical Humbug' that ruthlessly criticised his work. Hickman died four years later at age 30. Though he was unappreciated at the time of his death, his work has since been positively reappraised and he is now recognised as one of the fathers of anesthesia.

By the late 1830s, Humphry Davy's experiments had become widely publicized within academic circles in the northeastern United States. Wandering lecturers would hold public gatherings, referred to as "ether frolics", where members of the audience were encouraged to inhale diethyl ether or nitrous oxide to demonstrate the mind-altering properties of these agents while providing much entertainment to on­lookers.<ref name=Desai2007/> Four notable men participated in these events and witnessed the use of ether in this manner. They were [[William Edward Clarke]] (1819–1898), [[Crawford Long|Crawford W. Long]] (1815–1878), [[Horace Wells]] (1815–1848), and [[William T. G. Morton]] (1819–1868).

While attending undergraduate school in Rochester, New York in 1839, classmates Clarke and Morton apparently participated in ether frolics with some regularity.<ref name=Sims1877/><ref name=Lyman1881/><ref name=Lyman1886/><ref name=Richmond1950/> In January 1842, by now a medical student at [[University of Vermont College of Medicine|Berkshire Medical College]], Clarke administered ether to a Miss Hobbie, while [[Elijah Pope]] performed a [[dental extraction]].<ref name=Lyman1881/> In so doing, he became the first to administer an inhaled anesthetic to facilitate the performance of a surgical procedure. Clarke apparently thought little of his accomplishment, and chose neither to publish nor to pursue this technique any further. Indeed, this event is not even mentioned in Clarke's biography.<ref name=Stone1898/>

Crawford W. Long was a physician and pharmacist practicing in [[Jefferson, Georgia]] in the mid-19th century. During his time as a student at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] in the late 1830s, he had observed and probably participated in the ether frolics that had become popular at that time. At these gatherings, Long observed that some participants experienced bumps and bruises, but afterward had no recall of what had happened. He postulated that that diethyl ether produced pharmacologic effects similar to those of nitrous oxide. On 30 March 1842, he administered diethyl ether by inhalation to a man named James Venable, in order to remove a tumor from the man's neck.<ref name=Long1849/> Long later removed a second tumor from Venable, again under ether anesthesia. He went on to employ ether as a general anesthetic for limb amputations and [[childbirth|parturition]]. Long however did not publish his experience until 1849, thereby denying himself much of the credit he deserved.<ref name=Long1849/>

On 10 December 1844, [[Gardner Quincy Colton]] held a public demonstration of nitrous oxide in Hartford, Connecticut. One of the participants, [[Samuel A. Cooley]], sustained a significant injury to his leg while under the influence of nitrous oxide without noticing the injury. Horace Wells, a Connecticut dentist present in the audience that day, immediately seized upon the significance of this apparent analgesic effect of nitrous oxide. The following day, Wells underwent a painless dental extraction while under the influence of nitrous oxide administered by Colton. Wells then began to administer nitrous oxide to his patients, successfully performing several dental extractions over the next couple of weeks.

William T. G. Morton, another [[New England]] dentist, was a former student and then-current business partner of Wells. He was also a former acquaintance and classmate of William Edward Clarke (the two had attended undergraduate school together in Rochester, New York). Morton arranged for Wells to demonstrate his technique for dental extraction under nitrous oxide general anesthesia at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], in conjunction with the prominent surgeon [[John Collins Warren]]. This demonstration, which took place on 20 January 1845, ended in failure when the patient cried out in pain in the middle of the operation.<ref name="Wells1847"/>

On 30 September 1846, Morton administered diethyl ether to Eben Frost, a music teacher from [[Boston]], for a dental extraction. Two weeks later, Morton became the first to publicly demonstrate the use of diethyl ether as a general anesthetic at Massachusetts General Hospital, in what is known today as the [[Ether Dome]].<ref name=Morton1847/> On 16 October 1846, John Collins Warren removed a tumor from the neck of a local printer, [[Edward Gilbert Abbott]]. Upon completion of the procedure, Warren reportedly quipped, "Gentlemen, this is no humbug." News of this event rapidly traveled around the world.<ref name=Fenster2001/> Morton published his experience that year.<ref name=Morton1847/> [[Harvard University]] professor [[Charles Thomas Jackson]] (1805–1880) later claimed that Morton stole his idea;<ref name=Jackson1861/> Morton disagreed and a lifelong dispute began.<ref name=Fenster2001/> For many years, Morton was credited as being the pioneer of general anesthesia in the Western hemisphere, despite the fact that his demonstration occurred four years after Long's initial experience. Long later petitioned [[William Crosby Dawson]] (1798–1856), a United States Senator from Georgia at that time, to support his claim on the floor of the [[United States Senate]] as the first to use ether anesthesia.<ref name=Northen1910/>

In 1847, Scottish [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] [[James Young Simpson]] (1811–1870) of [[Edinburgh]] was the first to use [[chloroform]] as a general anesthetic. The use of chloroform anesthesia expanded rapidly thereafter in Europe. Chloroform began to replace ether as an anesthetic in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. It was soon abandoned in favor of ether when its [[liver|hepatic]] and [[heart|cardiac]] [[toxicity]], especially its tendency to cause potentially fatal [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]s, became apparent.

In 1871, the German surgeon [[Friedrich Trendelenburg]] (1844–1924) published a paper describing the first successful [[Choice|elective]] human [[tracheotomy]] to be performed for the purpose of administration of general anesthesia.<ref name=Trendelenburg1871/><ref name=Hargrave1934/><ref name=Wawersik1991/><ref name=Bain1964/>

In 1880, the Scottish surgeon [[William Macewen]] (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, as well as in the setting of general anesthesia with [[chloroform]].<ref name=Macewen18800724/><ref name=Macewen18800731/><ref name=Macmillan2010/> All previous observations of the glottis and larynx (including those of [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García|Manuel García]],<ref name=Garcia1855/> [[Wilhelm Hack]]<ref name="Hack1878-sammlung"/><ref name="Hack1878-uber"/> and Macewen) had been performed under indirect vision (using mirrors) until 23 April 1895, when [[Alfred Kirstein]] (1863–1922) of Germany first described direct visualization of the vocal cords. Kirstein performed the first direct laryngoscopy in Berlin, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an ''autoscope''.<ref name=Hirsch1986/> The death of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]] (1831–1888)<ref name=Mackenzie1888/> may have motivated Kirstein to develop the autoscope.<ref name=Burkle2004/>

==20th century==
[[File:Hermann Emil Fischer.jpg|thumb|[[Hermann Emil Fischer]], German [[chemist]]]]

The 20th century saw the transformation of the practices of tracheotomy, [[endoscopy]] and non-surgical tracheal intubation from rarely employed procedures to essential components of the practices of anesthesia, [[Intensive-care medicine|critical care medicine]], [[emergency medicine]], [[gastroenterology]], pulmonology and surgery.

In 1902, [[Hermann Emil Fischer]] (1852–1919) and [[Joseph von Mering]] (1849–1908) discovered that [[barbital|diethylbarbituric acid]] was an effective [[hypnotic]] agent.<ref name=Fischer1903/> Also called barbital or ''Veronal'' (the [[trade name]] assigned to it by [[Bayer|Bayer Pharmaceuticals]]), this new drug became the first commercially marketed [[barbiturate]]; it was used as a treatment for [[insomnia]] from 1903 until the mid-1950s.

Until 1913, [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]] was performed by mask [[Inhalational anaesthetic|inhalation anesthesia]], topical application of [[local anesthetic]]s to the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]], rectal anesthesia, or [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] anesthesia. While otherwise effective, these techniques did not protect the airway from obstruction and also exposed patients to the risk of pulmonary aspiration of blood and [[mucus]] into the tracheobronchial tree. In 1913, [[Chevalier Jackson]] (1865–1958) was the first to report a high rate of success for the use of direct laryngoscopy as a means to intubate the trachea.<ref name=Jackson1913/> Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that had a light source at the distal tip, rather than the proximal light source used by Kirstein.<ref name=Zeitels1998/> This new blade incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope.<ref name=Jackson1922/>

Also in 1913, [[Henry H. Janeway]] (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed.<ref name=Janeway1913/> An American anesthesiologist practicing at [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]] in [[New York City]], Janeway was of the opinion that direct intratracheal [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] of [[Volatile anaesthetic|volatile anesthetics]] would provide improved conditions for [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngologic]] surgery. With this in mind, he developed a laryngoscope designed for the sole purpose of tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson's device, Janeway's instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the tracheal tube in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.<ref name=Burkle2004/>

[[Sodium thiopental]], the first [[intravenous anesthetic]], was synthesized in 1934 by [[Ernest H. Volwiler]] (1893–1992) and [[Donalee L. Tabern]] (1900–1974), working for [[Abbott Laboratories]].<ref name=Tabern1935/> It was first used in humans on 8 March 1934 by [[Ralph M. Waters]] in an investigation of its properties, which were short-term anesthesia and surprisingly little analgesia. Three months later, [[John Silas Lundy]] started a clinical trial of thiopental at the [[Mayo Clinic]] at the request of Abbott Laboratories. Volwiler and Tabern were awarded U.S. Patent No. 2,153,729 in 1939 for the discovery of thiopental, and they were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1986.

In 1939, the search for a synthetic substitute for atropine culminated serendipitously in the discovery of meperidine, the first opiate with a structure altogether different from that of morphine.<ref name=Eisleb1939/> This was followed in 1947 by the widespread introduction of methadone, another structurally unrelated compound with pharmacological properties similar to those of morphine.<ref name=Scott1946/>

After [[World War I]], further advances were made in the field of intratracheal anesthesia. Among these were those made by Sir [[Ivan Magill|Ivan Whiteside Magill]] (1888–1986). Working at the [[Frognal House|Queen's Hospital for Facial and Jaw Injuries]] in [[Sidcup]] with plastic surgeon Sir [[Harold Gillies]] (1882–1960) and anesthetist [[E. Stanley Rowbotham]] (1890–1979), Magill developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation.<ref name=Rowbotham1921/><ref name="Magill1923-provision"/><ref name=Magill1928/><ref name=Magill1930/><ref name=Thomas1978/><ref name=Mclachlan2008/> Magill devised a new type of angulated forceps (the Magill forceps) that are still used today to facilitate nasotracheal intubation in a manner that is little changed from Magill's original technique.<ref name=Magill1920/> Other devices invented by Magill include the Magill laryngoscope blade,<ref name=Magill1926/> as well as several apparatuses for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents.<ref name="Magill1921-portable"/><ref name="Magill1921-warming"/><ref name="Magill1923-apparatus"/> The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill.

The first hospital anesthesia department was established at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1936, under the leadership of [[Henry K. Beecher]] (1904–1976).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Sir [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh]] (1897–1989) achieved significant advances in techniques for tracheal intubation when he introduced his new curved laryngoscope blade in 1943.<ref name=Macintosh1943/> The Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.<ref name=Scott2009/> In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the novel use of a [[Natural rubber|gum elastic]] [[Urinary catheterization#Catheter types|urinary catheter]] as an endotracheal tube introducer to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation.<ref name=Macintosh1949/> Inspired by Macintosh's report, P. Hex Venn (who was at that time the anesthetic advisor to the British firm Eschmann Bros. & Walsh, Ltd.) set about developing an endotracheal tube introducer based on this concept. Venn's design was accepted in March 1973, and what became known as the Eschmann endotracheal tube introducer went into production later that year.<ref name=Venn1993/> The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from [[polyester]] threads and an outer [[resin]] layer. This provided more stiffness but maintained the flexibility and the slippery surface. Other differences were the length (the new introducer was {{convert|60|cm|0|1|abbr=on}}, which is much longer than the gum elastic bougie) and the presence of a 35° curved tip, permitting it to be steered around obstacles.<ref name=Viswanathan1992/><ref name=Henderson2003/>

Many new intravenous and inhalational anesthetics were developed and brought into clinical use during the second half of the 20th century. [[Paul Janssen]] (1926–2003), the founder of [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]], is credited with the development of over 80 pharmaceutical compounds.<ref name=Stanley2008/> Janssen synthesized nearly all of the [[butyrophenone]] class of [[antipsychotic]] agents, beginning with [[haloperidol]] (1958) and [[droperidol]] (1961).<ref name=Janssen1963d/> These agents were rapidly integrated into the practice of anesthesia.<ref name=Castro1959/><ref name=Nilsson1961/><ref name=Aubry1966/><ref name=Corrsen1966/><ref name=Reyes1969/> In 1960, Janssen's team synthesized [[fentanyl]], the first of the [[N-Phenethyl-4-piperidinone|piperidinone]]-derived opioids.<ref name=Janssen1960f/><ref name=Janssen1963f/> Fentanyl was followed by [[sufentanil]] (1974),<ref name=Niemegeers1976/> [[alfentanil]] (1976),<ref name=Spierdijk1980/><ref name=Niemegeers1981/> [[carfentanil]] (1976),<ref name=DeVos1978/> and [[lofentanil]] (1980).<ref name=Laduron1982/> Janssen and his team also developed [[etomidate]] (1964),<ref name=Doenicke1973/><ref name=Morgan1975/> a potent intravenous anesthetic induction agent.

The concept of using a fiberoptic endoscope for tracheal intubation was introduced by [[Peter Murphy (anaesthetist)|Peter Murphy]], an English anesthetist, in 1967.<ref name=Murphy1967/> By the mid-1980s, the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope had become an indispensable instrument within the [[pulmonology]] and anesthesia communities.<ref name=Wheeler2007/>

[[File:Maquet Flow-I anesthesia machine.jpg|thumb|left|A modern [[anaesthetic machine]]. This particular machine is a "Flow-I" model, manufactured by [[Maquet]], a division of [[Getinge Group]], [[Getinge]], [[Sweden]].]]

The [[Information Age|"digital revolution"]] of the 21st century has brought newer technology to the art and science of tracheal intubation. Several manufacturers have developed [[Video_laryngoscope#Video_laryngoscope|video laryngoscopes]] which employ [[Digital electronics|digital technology]] such as the [[CMOS|complementary metal–oxide semiconductor]] [[active pixel sensor]] (CMOS APS) to generate a view of the glottis so that the trachea may be intubated. The Glidescope video laryngoscope is one example of such a device.<ref name=Agro2003/><ref name=Cooper2005/>

[[Xenon]] has been used as a general anesthetic. Although it is expensive, anesthesia machines that can deliver xenon are about to appear on the European market, because advances in recovery and recycling of xenon have made it economically viable.<ref name=Tonner2006/>
