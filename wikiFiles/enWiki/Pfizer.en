'''Pfizer, Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|aɪ|z|ər}}) ({{New York Stock Exchange|PFE}}) is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] corporation headquartered in [[New York City]],<ref>"[http://www.pfizer.com/contact/ Contact Us]." Pfizer. Retrieved on April 3, 2010.</ref> and with its research headquarters in [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], Connecticut, United States.

Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for a wide range of conditions including in the areas of immunology and inflammation, oncology, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, neuroscience and pain. Pfizer's products include Lipitor ([[atorvastatin]], used to lower LDL blood cholesterol); Lyrica ([[pregabalin]], for neuropathic pain/fibromyalgia); Diflucan ([[fluconazole]], an oral antifungal medication); Zithromax ([[azithromycin]], an antibiotic); Viagra ([[sildenafil]], for [[erectile dysfunction]]); and Celebrex/Celebra ([[celecoxib]], an anti-inflammatory drug).

Pfizer was founded by cousins [[Charles Pfizer]] and [[Charles Erhart]] in New York City in 1849 as a manufacturer of [[fine chemical]]s. Pfizer's discovery of [[oxytetracycline|Terramycin (oxytetracycline)]] in 1950 put it on a path towards becoming a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer has made numerous acquisitions, including of [[Warner–Lambert]] in 2000, [[Pharmacia]] in 2003 and [[Wyeth]] in 2009, the latter acquired for US$68&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/business/26drug.html |title=Pfizer Agrees to Pay $68&nbsp;billion for Rival Drug Maker Wyeth |work=The New York Times |date=January 26, 2009 |author=Andrew Ross Sorkin and Duff Wilson }}</ref><ref name=PfizerWyeth>{{cite web

==History==

===19th century===
[[Image:Charlespfizer.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Charles Pfizer]]
Pfizer is named after [[German-American]] cousins [[Charles Pfizer]] and Charles Erhart (originally from [[Ludwigsburg]], Germany) who launched a chemicals business, '''Charles Pfizer and Company''', from a building at the intersection of Harrison Avenue and Bartlett Street<ref name="Citycyclopedia">Kenneth T. Jackson. [yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn= 9780300055368 ''The Encyclopedia of New York City'']. The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; September 1995. P. 895. ISBN 978-0-300-05536-8</ref> in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] in 1849. There, they produced an [[antiparasitic]] called [[santonin]]. This was an immediate success, although it was the production of [[citric acid]] that really kick-started Pfizer's growth in the 1880s. Pfizer continued to buy property to expand its lab and factory on the block bounded by Bartlett Street; Harrison Avenue; Gerry Street; and [[Flushing Avenue]]. Pfizer established its original administrative headquarters at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan.<ref name="Citycyclopedia"/>

===20th century===
By 1906, sales totaled nearly $3&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

World War I caused a shortage of [[calcium citrate]] that Pfizer imported from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid, and the company began a search for an alternative supply. Pfizer chemists learned of a fungus that ferments sugar to citric acid and were able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source in 1919. As a result Pfizer developed expertise in [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] technology. These skills were applied to the mass production of [[penicillin]] during [[World War II]], in response to a need from the U.S. government. The [[antibiotic]] was needed to treat injured Allied soldiers; most of the penicillin that went ashore with the troops on [[D-Day]] was made by Pfizer.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the 1940s, penicillin became very inexpensive. As a result, Pfizer decided to search for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. The discovery and commercialization of [[oxytetracycline|Terramycin (oxytetracycline)]] by Pfizer in 1950 moved the company on the path of change from a manufacturer of [[fine chemical]]s to a research-based pharmaceutical company. To augment its research in fermentation technology, Pfizer began a program to discover drugs through chemical synthesis. Pfizer also established an animal health division in 1959 with an {{convert|700|acre|km2 |adj=on}} farm and research facility in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]].

By the 1950s, Pfizer was established in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Iran, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, Turkey and the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In 1960, the Company moved its medical research laboratory operations to a new facility in Groton, Connecticut. In 1980 Pfizer launched [[piroxicam|Feldene (piroxicam)]], a prescription [[anti-inflammatory]] medication that became Pfizer's first product to reach a total of a billion United States dollars in sales.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

During the 1980s and 1990s Pfizer underwent a period of growth sustained by the discovery and marketing of [[Zoloft]], [[Lipitor]], [[Norvasc]], [[Zithromax]], [[Aricept]], [[Diflucan]], and [[Viagra]].

=== 21st century===
Pfizer has recently grown by mergers, including those with [[Warner–Lambert]] (2000), [[Pharmacia]] (2003), and [[Wyeth]] (2009).

On June 26, 2006, Pfizer announced that it would sell its Consumer Healthcare unit (manufacturer of [[Listerine]], [[Nicorette]], [[Visine]], [[Sudafed]] and [[Neosporin]]) to [[Johnson & Johnson]] for $16.6&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/money/archives/articles/2006/6/26/082230.cfm|date=June 26, 2006|title=Johnson & Johnson to Buy Pfizer Unit|accessdate=July 19, 2007|publisher=MoneyNews.com}}{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref><ref>

Development of [[torcetrapib]], a drug that increases production of [[high density lipoprotein|HDL]], or "good cholesterol", which reduces [[low density lipoprotein|LDL]] thought to be correlated to heart disease, was cancelled in December 2006. During a Phase III clinical trial involving 15,000 patients there were more deaths than expected in the group that took the medicine, and a 60% increase in deaths was seen among patients taking torcetrapib plus Lipitor versus Lipitor alone. There was no suggestion these results called into question the safety of Lipitor. Pfizer lost nearly $1&nbsp;billion invested developing the failed drug, and the market value of the company plummeted in the aftermath.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/health/05pfizer.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Pfizer Shares Plummet on Loss of a Promising Heart Drug] By ALEX BERENSON and ANDREW POLLACK.

A July 2010 article in ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'' reported that Pfizer was seeing more success in its battle against makers of [[counterfeit]] prescription drugs by pursuing civil lawsuits rather than criminal prosecution. Pfizer has hired customs and narcotics experts from all over the globe to track down fakes and assemble evidence that can be used to pursue civil suits for [[trademark infringement]]. Since 2007, Pfizer has spent $3.3&nbsp;million on investigations and legal fees and recovered about $5.1&nbsp;million, with another $5&nbsp;million tied up in ongoing cases.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bennett |first=Simeon |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_29/b4187021988297.htm |title=Pfizer: Civil Suits for Drug Counterfeiters |work=BusinessWeek  |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref>

====Warner–Lambert acquisition====
Pfizer acquired Warner–Lambert in 2000.<ref>Pfizer, [http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/pfizer_warner_lambert.jsp 2000: Pfizer joins forces with Warner–Lambert], accessed April 7, 2010</ref> Warner–Lambert was founded as a drug store in 1856 in Philadelphia by William R. Warner. Inventing a tablet-coating process gained Warner a place in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Parke–Davis was founded in Detroit in 1866, by Hervey Parke and George Davis. Warner–Lambert took over Parke–Davis in 1976, and acquired [[Wilkinson Sword]] in 1993 and [[Agouron]] in 1999.

====Pharmacia acquisition====
In 2002, Pfizer merged with [[Pharmacia]]. The merger was again driven in part by the desire to acquire full rights to a product, this time Celebrex ([[celecoxib]]), the [[COX-2 selective inhibitor]] previously jointly marketed by Searle (acquired by Pharmacia) and Pfizer. In the ensuing years, Pfizer commenced with a massive restructuring resulting in numerous site closures and loss of jobs including: Terre Haute, IN; Holland, MI; Groton, CT; Brooklyn, NY; Sandwich, UK and Puerto Rico.

Pharmacia had been formed by a series of mergers and acquisition, with its predecessors including [[Searle]], [[Upjohn]] and [[Sugen]].

Searle was founded in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1888. The founder was Gideon Daniel Searle. In 1908, the company was incorporated in Chicago. In 1941, the company established headquarters in Skokie, Illinois. It was acquired by the [[Monsanto Company]], headquartered in [[St. Louis]], in 1985.

The Upjohn Company was a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm founded in 1886 in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]] by Dr. [[William E. Upjohn]], an 1875 graduate of the [[University of Michigan]] medical school. The company was originally formed to make friable pills, which were specifically designed to be easily digested. In 1995, Upjohn merged with [[Pharmacia]], to form [[Pharmacia & Upjohn]]. [[Pharmacia]] was created in April 2000 through the merger of Pharmacia & Upjohn with the Monsanto Company and its G.D. Searle unit. The merged company was based in Peapack, New Jersey. The agricultural division was spun off from Pharmacia, as Monsanto, in preparation for the close of the acquisition by Pfizer.<ref name="urlPharmacia to Spin Off Monsanto Stake, Less Than 2 Years After Firms Merger Wall Street Journal 28nov01">{{cite web | url = http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/Monsanto-Pharmacia-SpinOff.htm | title = Pharmacia to Spin Off Monsanto Stake, Less Than 2 Years After Firms' Merger Wall Street Journal 28nov01 | date = | quote = }}</ref>

[[SUGEN]] was a company focused on protein kinase inhibitors, founded in 1991 in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], California and acquired by [[Pharmacia]] in 1999. The company pioneered the use of ATP-mimetic small molecules to block signal transduction. After the Pfizer merger, the SUGEN site was shut down in 2003, with the loss of over 300 jobs, and the transfer of several programs to Pfizer. These included [[sunitinib]] (Sutent), which was approved for human use by the FDA in January 2006, passed $1 bn in annual revenues for Pfizer in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/files/annualreport/2010/financial/financial2010.pdf |title=Pfizer 2010 annual financial review, p 25. |format=PDF |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref>  A related compound SU11654 ([[Toceranib]]) was also approved for canine tumors, and the ALK inhibitor [[Crizotinib]] also grew out of a SUGEN program<ref>{{cite web|author=Post a Job |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-05/pfizer-drug-targets-gene-flaw-to-shrink-lung-tumors-update1-.html |title=Pfizer Drug Targets Gene Flaw to Shrink Lung Tumors (Update1) |work=Businessweek  |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref>

In 2008, Pfizer announced 275 job cuts at the Kalamazoo manufacturing facility. Kalamazoo was previously the world headquarters for the Upjohn Company.<ref name="urlPfizer plant in Michigan to cut 275 - FiercePharma">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/pfizer-plant-michigan-cut-275/2008-07-15 | title = Pfizer plant in Michigan to cut 275 – FiercePharma | date = | quote = }}</ref>

====Wyeth acquisition====
On January 26, 2009, after more than a year of talks between the two companies, Pfizer agreed to buy pharmaceuticals rival [[Wyeth]] for a combined US$68&nbsp;billion in cash, shares and loans, including some US$22.5&nbsp;billion lent by five major Wall Street banks. The deal cemented Pfizer's position as the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, with the merged company generating over US$20&nbsp;billion in cash each year, and was the largest corporate merger since [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]] and [[BellSouth]]'s US$70&nbsp;billion deal in March 2006.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/business/26drug.html Pfizer Agrees to Pay $68&nbsp;billion for Rival Drug Maker Wyeth] By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and DUFF WILSON. January 26, 2009. ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> The combined company was expected to save US$4&nbsp;billion annually through streamlining; however, as part of the deal, both companies must repatriate billions of dollars in revenue from foreign sources to the United States, which will result in higher tax costs. The acquisition was completed on October 15, 2009, making Wyeth a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.<ref name=PfizerWyeth/>

The merger was broadly criticized. [[Harvard Business School]]’s Gary Pisano told [[The Wall Street Journal]] that "The record of big mergers and acquisitions in Big Pharma has just not been good. There’s just been an enormous amount of shareholder wealth destroyed".<ref>[http://industry.bnet.com/pharma/1000627/the-pfizer-wyeth-deal-worst-case-scenario/ The Pfizer–Wyeth Deal Worst-Case Scenario] By Jim Edwards | January 23, 2009 – BNET</ref>

The Warner–Lambert and Pharmacia mergers do not appear to have achieved gains for shareholders so it is unclear who will benefit from the Wyeth–Pfizer merger to many critics.<ref name="Matthew">Matthew Karnitschnig, & Jonathan D. Rockoff. (2009, January 23). Pfizer in Talks to Buy Wyeth. Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition), p. A.1. Retrieved March 7, 2010, from Wall Street Journal. (Document ID: 1631280041).</ref>

====King Pharmaceuticals acquisition====
In October 2010, Pfizer agreed to buy [[King Pharmaceuticals]] for $3.6 billion in cash or $14.25 per share: an approximately 40% premium over King’s closing share price 11 October 2010.<ref name="htanna">{{cite news|title=Pfizer to buy King Pharma for $3.6&nbsp;billion in cash|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1216434820101012|agency=Reuters  |accessdate=October 12, 2010 | date=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

===2011 to present===
In February 2011 it was announced that it was to close its research and development facility in [[Kent]], which employs 2,400 people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12335801 |work=BBC News  | title=Pfizer to close UK research site | date=February 1, 2011}}</ref>

In April 2011 Pfizer agreed to sell its [[Capsugel]] unit, the world's largest maker of hard capsules, for about $2.38&nbsp;billion to the private equity firm [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR & Co]]. The cash will be used for a part of [[share repurchase|share buyback]] about $5&nbsp;billion planned for 2011.<ref>Pfizer selling Capsugel to KKR for $2.38&nbsp;billion http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre73321d-us-pfizer-kkr/</ref>

In 2012, Pfizer acquired [[Alacer Corp.]], producer of [[Emergen-C]].

On September 4, 2012, the FDA approved a Pfizer pill for a rare type of [[leukemia]]. The medicine, called '''Bosulif''', treats [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML), a blood and bone marrow disease that usually affects older adults.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA approves Pfizer leukemia drug |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/04/us-pfizer-leukemia-idUSBRE88314720120904 |publisher= Reuters|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref>

In September 2009, Pfizer agreed to pay [[List of Largest Pharmaceutical Settlements|$2.3&nbsp;billion]] to settle civil and criminal allegations that it had illegally marketed four drugs&mdash;[[Bextra]], [[Geodon]], [[Zyvox]], and [[Lyrica]]&mdash;"for non-approved uses; it was Pfizer's fourth such settlement in a decade.<ref name="2.3 nytimes"/><ref name="wapo offlabel"/><ref name="Pfizer agrees record fraud fine"/>  Pharmacia & Upjohn Company, Inc., a Pfizer subsidiary, agreed to plead guilty to mis-branded promotion of Bextra, a felony violation of the [[Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]].

In 1996, an outbreak of measles, cholera, and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria.

Pfizer denied these claims, and subsequently produced an approval letter for testing from the Nigerian Ethics Committee. The Nigerian government insisted that it was a fake and a panel of Nigerian medical experts agreed that the letter had been concocted and backdated by the company's lead researcher in Kano. They went on to conclude that Pfizer never obtained authorization from the Nigerian government to give the unproven drug to children and infants.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/06/AR2006050601338.html Panel Faults Pfizer in '96 Clinical Trial In Nigeria].

In June 2010, the US Supreme Court rejected Pfizer's appeal against a ruling allowing lawsuits by the Nigerian families to proceed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/us_and_canada/10454982.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Pfizer-Nigeria appeal dismissed | date=June 29, 2010}}</ref>

===Wyeth's Rapamune===
A "whistleblower suit" was filed in 2005 against [[Wyeth]], which was acquired by Pfizer, alleging that the company illegally marketed their drug [[Rapamune]]. Wyeth is targeted in the suit for off-label marketing, targeting specific doctors and medical facilities to increased sales of Rapamune, trying to get current transplant patients to change from their current transplant drugs to Rapamune and for specifically targeting African-Americans. According to the whistleblowers, Wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals with kickbacks to prescribe the drug in the form of grants, donations and other money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmalot.com/2010/05/wyeth-targeted-blacks-with-illegal-marketing-lawsuit/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Pharmalot+%28Pharmalot%29 |title=Wyeth Marketing Targeted Blacks Illegally: Lawsuit // Pharmalot |publisher=Pharmalot.com |date=May 24, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=June 14, 2010 &#8212; 9:53&nbsp;am ET |url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/congress-joins-probe-wyeths-rapamune-marketing/2010-06-14?utm_medium=nl&utm_source=internal |title=Congress joins probe into Wyeth's Rapamune marketing |publisher=FiercePharma |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011|unused_data=By Tracy Staton}}</ref> A US House of Representatives committee, led by Rep.

===Brigham Young University===
Controversy arose over the drug "Celebrex."  [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) said that a professor of chemistry, Dr. Daniel Simmons, discovered an enzyme in the 1990s which would later lead towards the development of Celebrex.  BYU was originally seeking 15% royalty on sales which would equate to $9.7 billion.  The court filings show that a research agreement was made with [[Monsanto]], later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better aspirin.  The enzyme that Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems, which Celebrex is used to reduce those issues.  A battle ensued, lasting over six years, because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while Pfizer claims it had met all obligations in regards to the Monsanto agreement.  This culminated in a $450 million amicable settlement without going to trial.  Pfizer said it would take a $450 million charge against first quarter earnings to settle.<ref>http://www.ajc.com/health/pfizer-settles-lawsuit-involving-1429314.html</ref>

==Environmental record==
According to the EPA, Pfizer is among the top ten companies in America with the most numerous emissions sources.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.kld.com/newsletter/Newsline/0705Newsline/0705KLDResearch.html |title=What's Happening at KLD |publisher=Kld.com |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref> A landfill and two wastewater lagoons in Ledyard, CT near the Pfizer plant in Groton, Connecticut, are a source of groundwater pollution in the area. According to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CT DEP), the Pfizer site is active under the CT DEP Site [[Environmental remediation|Remediation]] program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/R1/npl_pad.nsf/31c4fec03a0762d285256bb80076489c/4114c04f6accd97685256b4200605b03!OpenDocument |title=Find New England Sites – PFIZER, INC |publisher=Yosemite.epa.gov |date=May 17, 2007 |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref> In June 2002, a chemical explosion at the Groton plant injured seven people and caused the evacuation of over 100 homes in the surrounding area.<ref name="autogenerated3">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/23/AR2006052301305_pf.html The tempest].

Pfizer has inherited Wyeth's liabilities in the [[American Cyanamid]] site in Bridgewater, New Jersey. This site is highly toxic and an EPA declared Superfund site.  Pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land in order to clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses.  Members of the surrounding communities have stated that the EPA has been coerced into accepting a plan that is affordable for Pfizer but is not a complete/proper remediation plan for the site, detrimental to the interest of the community.  The EPA has suggested a remediation plan that includes environmental caps and  redeveloping a portion of it in the future.  This redevelopment will occur on the site which is located within a flood plain, something the EPA failed to address in their feasibility study released in early 2012. The mayor of Bridgewater, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, and other key community leaders also came out to endorse the plan without considering the amount of increased flooding that is going to take place if such a plan is implemented.<ref name="autogenerated5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20120309/NJNEWS/303090029/Even-after-costly-clean-up-toxins-would-remain-American-Cyanamid-site |title=Even after costly clean-up, toxins would remain at American Cyanamid site |publisher=My Central Jersey |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref>

==Political lobbying==
Pfizer is a leading member of the [[U.S. Global Leadership Coalition]], a Washington D.C.-based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for a larger International Affairs Budget, which funds American diplomatic, humanitarian, and development efforts abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usglc.org/about/our-coalition |title=U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, Global Trust members |publisher=Usglc.org |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref>

Pfizer is one of the single largest lobbying interests in United States politics. For example in the first 9 months of 2009 Pfizer spent over $16.3&nbsp;million on lobbying US congressional lawmakers, making them the sixth largest lobbying interest in the US (following Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which ranked fourth but also represents many of their interests). A spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company “wanted to make sure our voice is heard in this conversation” in regards to the company's expenditure of $25&nbsp;million in 2010 to lobby health care reform.<ref>Steinbrook, R., 2009. Lobbying, Campaign Contributions, and Health Care Reform. New England Journal of Medicine, 361(23), e52–e52. [http://healthcarereform.nejm.org/?p=2358]</ref>

Pfizer's primary interests are opposition of Congressional efforts to attach a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and opposition to generic drugs entering US markets.<ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000138] Heavy Hitters Pfizer Inc.</ref> Pfizer also purportedly proposed a ban on all [[lawsuit]]s against [[manufacturing|manufacturers]] of [[body implant]] parts which was proposed in the [[United States Congress]] as part of [[tort reform]] legislation.<ref>[http://www.prwatch.org/node/7801] Justice, Texas-Style</ref>

According to [[U.S. State Department]] cables released by the [[whistle-blowing]] site [[WikiLeaks]], Pfizer "lobbied against New Zealand getting a [[free trade]] agreement with the United States because it objected to New Zealand’s restrictive drug buying rules and tried to get rid of New Zealand’s former health minister, [[Helen Clark]], in 1990.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2010/12/20/headlines/wikileaks_pfizer_opposed_new_zealand_trade_deal WikiLeaks: Pfizer Opposed New Zealand Trade Deal], ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' (December 20, 2010)</ref><ref name="NZ_Herald_10695239">{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/pharmaceuticals/news/article.cfm?c_id=278&objectid=10695239 |title= WikiLeaks: Drug firms tried to ditch Clark |author=David Fisher and Jonathan Milne |date=December 19, 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=November 3, 2011}}</ref>

==Employment and diversity==
Pfizer received a 100% rating on the [[Corporate Equality Index]] released by the [[Human Rights Campaign]] starting in 2004, the third year of the report. In 2007, Pfizer's Canadian division was named one of [[Canada's Top 100 Employers]], as published in [[Maclean's]] magazine, the only research-based pharmaceutical company to receive this honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/einfo?en=Pfizer+Canada+Inc.&ri=6a24852a7f1d493ca1615bbec1e4e6aa&rk=2530d7bedc69eed8a38cea9bbe668b30 |title=Reasons for Selection, 2007 Canada's Top 100 Employers}}</ref> In 2008, there was controversy, including inquiries from members of Congress, around Pfizer's practice of replacing US workers with H-1b guest workers<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.vdare.com/archives/2008/11/10/pfizers-american-workers-training-their-replacements|title=Pfizer's American Workers Training Their Replacements}}</ref>

==AIDS involvement==
Pfizer has been involved in controversies over the medicine Diflucan (generic name fluconazole). In 1998, a campaign by Thai public health groups led to the elimination of the Pfizer monopoly on selling fluconazole in Thailand, and the price of the antifungal drug decreased from 200 baht to 6.5 baht in nine months, vastly expanding access to the medicine for AIDS patients. Faced with pressure for compulsory licenses to the Pfizer patent on this drug, Pfizer later established a program for limited access to the medicine in Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww4.aegis.org/news/re/2001/RE010226.html |title=S.Africa okays Pfizer AIDS drug distribution|publisher=Reuters NewMedia|date=February 21, 2001 |first=Emelia|last=Sithole|accessdate=May 15, 2006}}</ref>

"In the United States, 46 percent of all new HIV/AIDS cases occur in the South. From 2003 to 2006 the Pfizer Foundation has funded 23 innovative HIV/AIDS prevention programs and strengthened the capacity of community-based organizations to reach and serve their communities."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/subsites/philanthropy/caring/global.health.hiv.southern.jsp |title=Global HIV/AIDS Partnerships: Southern HIV/AIDS Prevention Initiative |publisher=Pfizer |accessdate=May 15, 2006}}</ref> Since 2003, Pfizer has committed a $3&nbsp;million grant toward supporting the Southern HIV/AIDS Prevention Initiative.

However, there were criticisms of the way Pfizer was testing its AIDS drug. "The European AIDS Treatment Group (EATG), collection of activists from 31 European Countries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eatg.org/|title=European AIDS Treatment Group|accessdate=May 15, 2006}}</ref> said the design of the trial for Pfizer's CCR5 inhibitor [[maraviroc]] (previously known as UK-427,857) is putting people with HIV infection at unnecessary risk of developing AIDS."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsmeds.com/news/20050412ethc002.html|title=Activists attack ethics of Pfizer AIDS drug trial|date=April 12, 2005|accessdate=May 15, 2006|first=Ben|last=Hirschler |publisher=AIDS Meds.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060426172351/http://www.aidsmeds.com/news/20050412ethc002.html |archivedate = April 26, 2006}}</ref>

On June 20, 2007, Pfizer received an approvable letter for maraviroc from the FDA advisory board. The letter was a product of expedited review of the novel HIV compound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsmap.com/Maraviroc-receives-accelerated-approval-in-US/page/1428086/ |title=Maraviroc receives accelerated approval in US |publisher=Aidsmap.com |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref>

In 2001, Pfizer asked the U.S. government to pressure the Brazilian government against issuing compulsory licenses for the patents on the AIDS drug nelfinavir.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In November 2009 Pfizer formed a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to create [[ViiV Healthcare]]. Viiv Healthcare received all of Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline's HIV assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5327ff12-2aaa-11de-8415-00144feabdc0.html |title=/ Companies / Pharmaceuticals – GSK and Pfizer to merge HIV portfolios |work=Financial Times  |date=April 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref>

AIDS drugs previously manufactured by Pfizer which are now produced by ViiV Healthcare include [[Nelfinavir|Viracept]] (nelfinavir mesylate), [[Maraviroc|Selzentry/Celsentri]] (maraviroc) and [[Delavirdine|Rescriptor]] (delavirdine mesylate).
