'''Pleural effusion''' is excess fluid that accumulates between the two [[pleural cavity|pleural layers]], the fluid-filled space that surrounds the lungs. Excessive amounts of such fluid can impair breathing by limiting the expansion of the lungs during ventilation.

==Pathophysiology==
Pleural fluid is secreted by the parietal layer of the [[pleura]] and reabsorbed by the lymphatics in the most dependent parts of the parietal pleura, primarily the diaphragmatic and mediastinal regions.

== Types of fluids ==

Four types of fluids can accumulate in the pleural space:

* [[Serous fluid]] ([[hydrothorax]])
* [[Blood]] ([[haemothorax]])
* [[Chyle]] ([[chylothorax]])
* [[Pus]] ([[pyothorax]] or [[empyema]])

== Diagnosis ==
Pleural effusion is usually diagnosed on the basis of [[medical history]] and [[physical exam]], and confirmed by [[chest x-ray]]. Once accumulated fluid is more than 300 ml, there are usually detectable [[clinical sign]]s in the patient, such as decreased movement of the chest on the affected side, stony dullness to percussion over the fluid, diminished [[breath sounds]] on the affected side, decreased vocal resonance and [[fremitus]] (though this is an inconsistent and unreliable sign), and [[pleural friction rub]]. Above the effusion, where the lung is compressed, there may be bronchial breathing and [[egophony]]. In large effusion there may be [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal]] deviation away from the effusion. A systematic review (2009) published as part of the Rational Clinical Examination Series in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) showed that dullness to conventional percussion was most accurate for diagnosing pleural effusion (summary positive likelihood ratio, 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.2–33.8), while the absence of reduced tactile vocal fremitus made pleural effusion less likely (negative likelihood ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.37).<ref name=Wong09>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.2008.937 | last1 = Wong | first1 = CL | last2 = Holroyd-Leduc | first2 = J | last3 = Straus | first3 = SE | author-separator =, | year = 2009 | month = Jan | title = Does this patient have a pleural effusion? | journal = JAMA | volume = 301 | issue = 3| pages = 309–17 | pmid = 19155458 }}</ref>

=== Imaging ===
A pleural effusion will show up as an area of whiteness on a standard posteroanterior X-ray.<ref>{{cite book |author=Corne, ''et al.'' |title = Chest X-Ray Made Easy|publisher = Churchill Livingstone|year = 2002|isbn = 0-443-07008-3}}</ref> Normally the space between the two layers of the lung, the visceral pleura and the parietal pleura, cannot be seen. A pleural effusion infiltrates the space between these layers. Because the pleural effusion has a density similar to body fluid or water, it can be seen on radiographs. Since the effusion has greater density than the rest of the lung, it will gravitate towards the lower portions of the [[pleural cavity]]. The pleural effusion behaves according to basic fluid dynamics, conforming to the shape of the lung and chest cavity. If the pleural cavity contains both air and fluid, then the fluid will have a "fluid level" that is horizontal instead of conforming to the lung space.<ref>{{cite book |author=Squire, Lucy Frank; Novelline, Robert A. |title=Squire's fundamentals of radiology |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2004 |pages=132–3 |isbn=0-674-01279-8 }}</ref> Chest radiographs acquired in the lateral [[decubitus]] position (with the patient lying on his side) are more sensitive and can pick up as little as 50 ml of fluid. At least 300 ml of fluid must be present before upright chest films can pick up signs of pleural effusion (e.g., blunted [[costophrenic angle]]s).

=== Thoracentesis ===
Once a pleural effusion is diagnosed, the cause must be determined. Pleural fluid is drawn out of the pleural space in a process called [[thoracentesis]]. A needle is inserted through the back of the chest wall in the sixth, seventh, or eighth intercostal space on the midaxillary line, into the pleural space. The fluid may then be evaluated for the following:

# Chemical composition including [[protein]], [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH), [[serum albumin|albumin]], [[amylase]], [[pH]], and [[glucose]]
# [[Gram stain]] and culture to identify possible bacterial infections
# [[cell (biology)|Cell]] count and differential
# [[Cytopathology]] to identify cancer cells, but may also identify some infective organisms
# Other tests as suggested by the clinical situation&nbsp;– [[lipid]]s, [[fungus|fungal culture]], [[virus|viral culture]], specific [[immunoglobulin]]s

=== Light's criteria ===
{{Transudate vs. exudate}}
[[File:Needle biopsy of the pleura.PNG|thumb|Instruments for needle biopsy of the pleura]]
Definitions of the terms "[[transudate]]" and "[[exudate]]" are the source of much confusion. Briefly, transudate is produced through pressure filtration without capillary injury while exudate is "inflammatory fluid" leaking between cells.

Transudative pleural effusions are defined as effusions that are caused by ''systemic'' factors that alter the pleural equilibrium, or [[Starling equation|Starling forces]]. The components of the Starling forces–hydrostatic pressure, permeability, oncotic pressure (effective pressure due to the composition of the pleural fluid and blood)–are altered in many diseases, e.g., [[heart failure|left ventricular failure]], renal failure, hepatic failure, and [[cirrhosis]]. Exudative pleural effusions, by contrast, are caused by alterations in ''local'' factors that influence the formation and absorption of pleural fluid (e.g., [[bacterial pneumonia]], [[cancer]], [[pulmonary embolism]], and viral infection).<ref>{{cite book |author=Light, Richard W. |chapter=Ch. 257: Disorders of the Pleura and Mediastinum |editor=Fauci AS, Braunwald E, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Jameson JL, Loscalzo J |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |edition=17th}}</ref>

An accurate diagnosis of the cause of the effusion, transudate versus exudate, relies on a comparison of the chemistries in the pleural fluid to those in the blood, using Light's criteria. According to Light's criteria (Light, et al. 1972), a pleural effusion is likely exudative if at least one of the following exists:<ref name="Lights">{{cite journal | author = Light R, Macgregor M, Luchsinger P, Ball W | title = Pleural effusions: the diagnostic separation of transudates and exudates | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 507–13 | year = 1972 | pmid = 4642731}}</ref>

The sensitivity and specificity of Light's criteria for detection of exudates have been measured in many studies and are usually reported to be around 98% and 80% respectively.<ref name=Romero>{{cite journal|last=Romero|first=S|coauthors=Martinez, A, Hernandez, L, Fernandez, C, Espasa, A, Candela, A, Martin, C|title=Light's criteria revisited: consistency and comparison with new proposed alternative criteria for separating pleural transudates from exudates.|journal=Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases|year=2000|volume=67|issue=1|pages=18–23|pmid=10705257|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=Porcel>{{cite journal|last=Porcel|first=JM|coauthors=Peña, JM, Vicente de Vera, C, Esquerda, A|title=[Reappraisal of the standard method (Light's criteria) for identifying pleural exudates].|journal=Medicina clinica|date=2006 Feb 18|volume=126|issue=6|pages=211–3|pmid=16510093|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref> This means that although Light's criteria are relatively accurate, twenty percent of patients with transudative pleural effusions are mistakenly identified by Light's criteria as having exudative pleural effusions. Therefore, if a patient identified by Light's criteria as having an exudative pleural effusion appears clinically to have a condition that usually produces transudative effusions, additional testing is needed. In such cases [[serum albumin|albumin]] levels in blood and pleural fluid are measured. If the difference between the albumin level in the blood and the pleural fluid is greater than 1.2 g/dL (12 g/L), this suggests that the patient has a transudative pleural effusion.<ref name="pmid2152757">{{cite journal |author=Roth BJ, O'Meara TF, Gragun WH |title=The serum-effusion albumin gradient in the evaluation of pleural effusions |journal=Chest |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=546–9 |year=1990 |pmid=2152757 |doi=10.1378/chest.98.3.546}}</ref> However, pleural fluid testing is not perfect, and the final decision about whether a fluid is a transudate or an exudate is based not on chemical analysis of the fluid, but on accurate diagnosis of the disease that produces the fluid.

The traditional definitions of transudate as a pleural effusion due to systemic factors and an exudate as a pleural effusion due to local factors have been used since 1940 or earlier (Light et al., 1972). Previous to Light's landmark study, which was based on work by Chandrasekhar, investigators unsuccessfully attempted to use other criteria, such as specific gravity, pH, and protein content of the fluid, to differentiate between transudates and exudates. Light's criteria are highly statistically sensitive for exudates (although not very statistically specific). More recent studies have examined other characteristics of pleural fluid that may help to determine whether the process producing the effusion is local (exudate) or systemic (transudate). The chart to the right, illustrates some of the results of these more recent studies. However, it should be borne in mind that Light's criteria are still the most widely used criteria.

The Rational Clinical Examination Series review found that bilateral effusions, symmetric and asymmetric, are the most common distribution in heart failure (60% of effusions in heart failure will be bilateral). When there is asymmetry in heart failure-associated pleural effusions (either unilateral or one side larger than the other), the right side is usually more involved than the left.<ref name=Wong09 />

== Causes ==

=== Transudative ===

The most common causes of [[transudative]] pleural effusions in the United States are [[heart failure|left ventricular failure]], and [[cirrhosis]] (causing [[hepatic hydrothorax]]). Nephrotic syndrome leading to increased loss of albumin and resultant hypoalbuminemia and thus reducing colloid osmotic pressure is another less common cause. Pulmonary embolisms were once thought to be transudative but have been recently shown to be exudative<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Porcel | first1 = JM | last2 = Light | first2 = RW | title = Pleural effusions due to pulmonary embolism. | journal = Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 337–42 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18520269 | author-separator =, | doi = 10.1097/MCP.0b013e3282fcea3c }}</ref>

Once identified as [[exudate|exudative]], additional evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the excess fluid, and pleural fluid amylase, glucose, pH and cell counts are obtained.

* Pleural fluid amylase is elevated in cases of esophageal rupture, [[Pancreatic fistula|pancreatic pleural effusion]], or cancer.
* Glucose is decreased with cancer, bacterial infections, or [[rheumatoid pleuritis]].
* Pleural fluid pH is low in empyema (<7.2) and may be low in cancer.
* If cancer is suspected, the pleural fluid is sent for cytology. If cytology is negative, and cancer is still suspected, either a [[thoracoscopy]], or needle biopsy<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Menezes Lyra R |title=A modified outer cannula can help thoracentesis after pleural biopsy |journal=Chest |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=296 |year=1997 |month=July |pmid=9228404 |doi=10.1378/chest.112.1.296 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/content/112/1/296.2.full.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> of the pleura may be performed.
* The fluid is also sent for [[Gram staining]] and culture, and, if suspicious for tuberculosis, examination for TB markers ([[adenosine deaminase]] > 45 IU/L, [[interferon gamma]] > 140 pg/mL, or positive [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) for tuberculous DNA).

The most common causes of exudative pleural effusions are bacterial [[pneumonia]], cancer (with [[lung cancer]], [[breast cancer]], and [[lymphoma]] causing approximately 75% of all malignant pleural effusions), viral infection, and [[pulmonary embolism]].

=== Other/ungrouped ===

Other causes of pleural effusion include [[tuberculosis]] (though pleural fluid smears are rarely positive for AFB, this is the most common cause of pleural effusion in some developing countries), [[autoimmune]] disease such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], bleeding (often due to chest trauma), [[chylothorax]] (most commonly caused by trauma), and accidental infusion of fluids.

Less common causes include esophageal rupture or pancreatic disease, intra-abdominal abscess, [[rheumatoid arthritis]], asbestos pleural effusion, [[Meigs syndrome]] (ascites and pleural effusion due to a benign [[ovarian tumor]]), and [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]].

Pleural effusions may also occur through medical/surgical interventions, including the use of medications (pleural fluid is usually [[eosinophilic]]), [[coronary artery bypass surgery]], abdominal surgery, [[endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], [[Liver transplantation|liver]] or [[lung transplantation]], and intra- or extravascular insertion of [[Central venous catheter|central lines]].

== Treatment ==

Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the pleural effusion.

Therapeutic aspiration may be sufficient; larger effusions may require insertion of an [[Chest tube|intercostal drain]] (either pigtail or surgical). When managing these chest tubes, it is important to make sure the chest tubes do not become occluded or clogged. A clogged chest tube in the setting of continued production of fluid will result in residual fluid left behind when the chest tube is removed. This fluid can lead to complications such as hypoxia due to lung collapse from the fluid, or fibrothorax, later, when the space scars down. Repeated effusions may require chemical ([[talc]], [[bleomycin]], [[tetracycline]]/[[doxycycline]]), or surgical [[pleurodesis]], in which the two pleural surfaces are scarred to each other so that no fluid can accumulate between them. This is a surgical procedure that involves inserting a chest tube, then either mechanically abrading the pleura or inserting the chemicals to induce a scar. This requires the chest tube to stay in until the fluid drainage stops. This can take days to weeks and can require prolonged hospitalizations. If the chest tube becomes clogged, fluid will be left behind and the pleurodesis will fail.

Pleurodesis fails in as many as 30% of cases. An alternative is to place a PleurX Pleural Catheter or Aspira Drainage Catheter. This is a 15Fr chest tube with a one-way valve. Each day the patient or care givers connect it to a simple vacuum tube and remove from 600 cc to 1000 cc of fluid. This can be repeated daily. When not in use, the tube is capped. This allows patients to be outside the hospital. For patients with [[malignant pleural effusion]]s, it allows them to continue chemotherapy, if indicated. Generally the tube is in for about 30 days and then it is removed when the space undergoes a spontaneous pleurodesis.
