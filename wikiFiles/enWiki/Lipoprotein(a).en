== Structure ==
Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] consists of an LDL-like particle and the specific apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], which is covalently bound to the apoB of the LDL like particle. Lp(a) plasma concentrations are highly heritable and mainly controlled by the apolipoprotein(a) gene [LPA] located on chromosome 6q26-27. Apo(a) proteins vary in size due to a size polymorphism [KIV-2 VNTR], which is caused by a variable number of so-called [[kringle domain|kringle]] IV repeats in the LPA gene. This size variation at the gene level is expressed on the protein level as well, resulting in apo(a) proteins with 10 to > 50 kringle IV repeats (each of the variable kringle IV consists of 114 amino acids).<ref name="pmid3670400"/><ref name=pmid2956279>{{cite journal | author = Utermann G, Menzel HJ, Kraft HG, Duba HC, Kemmler HG, Seitz C | title = Lp(a) glycoprotein phenotypes.

There appears to be a relationship between the number of kringle repeats and the processing time of the precursor apo (a) protein. That is, the larger the isoform, the more apo(a) precursor protein accummulates intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum.  Lipoprotein (a) is not fully synthesized until the precursor protein is released from the cell, so the slower rate of production for the larger isoforms limits the plasma concentration.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lobentanz EM, et al.| title=Intracellular metabolism of human apolipoprotein(a) in stably transfected Hep G2 cells | journal=Biochemistry | year= 1998 | volume=21 | issue=16 | pages=5417–25| PMID=9548923 | doi=10.1021/bi972761t}}</ref><ref name=pmid8943305>{{cite journal | author = Brunner C, Lobentanz EM, Pethö-Schramm A, Ernst A, Kang C, Dieplinger H, Müller HJ, Utermann G | title = The number of identical kringle IV repeats in apolipoprotein(a) affects its processing and secretion by HepG2 cells | journal = J.

Apo(a) is expressed by liver cells (hepatocytes), and the assembly of apo(a) and LDL particles seems to take place at the outer hepatocyte surface. The half-life of Lp(a) in the circulation is about 3 to 4 days.<ref name=pmid8432853>{{cite journal |author=Rader DJ, Cain W, Zech LA, Usher D, Brewer HB |title=Variation in lipoprotein(a) concentrations among individuals with the same apolipoprotein (a) isoform is determined by the rate of lipoprotein(a) production |journal=J.

==Catabolism and clearance==
The mechanism and sites of Lp(a) catabolism are largely unknown.

==Populations==
Lp(a) concentrations vary over one thousandfold between individuals, from < 0.2 to > 200&nbsp;mg/dL.  This range of concentrations is observed in all populations studied so far. The mean and median concentrations between different world populations show distinct particularities, the main being the two- to threefold higher Lp(a) plasma concentration of populations of African descent compared to Asian, Oceanic, or European populations. The general inverse correlation between apo(a) isoform size and Lp(a)  plasma concentration is observed in all populations, however, mean Lp(a) associated with certain apo(a) isoforms varies between populations.

==Function==
The physiological function of Lp(a)/apo(a) is still unknown. A function within the coagulation system seems plausible, given the aspect of the high homology between apo(a) and plasminogen.<ref name="pmid3670400" /> In fact, the LPA gene derives from a duplication of the plasminogen gene.

Other functions have been related to recruitment of inflammatory cells through interaction with Mac-1 integrin, angiogenesis, and wound healing.

However, individuals without Lp(a) or with very low Lp(a) levels seem to be healthy. Thus plasma Lp(a) is certainly not vital, at least under normal environmental conditions. Since apo(a)/Lp(a) derived  rather recently in mammalian evolution - only old world monkeys and humans have been shown to harbour Lp(a) - its function might not be vital but just evolutionarily advantageous under certain environmental conditions, e.g. in case of exposure to certain infectious diseases. 

Another possibility, suggested by [[Linus Pauling]], is that Lp(a) is a primate adaptation to [[L-gulonolactone oxidase]] (GULO) deficiency, who thought that found only in certain lines of mammals. GULO is required for converting [[glucose]] to [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C), which is needed to repair arteries; following the loss of GULO, those primates that adopted diets less abundant in vitamin C may have used Lp(a) as an ascorbic-acid surrogate to repair arterial walls.<ref name = "Pauling_1992">{{cite journal | author = Pauling L, Rath M | title = A Unified Theory of Human Cardiovascular Disease| journal = Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine | year = 1992 | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | url = http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1992/pdf/1992-v07n01-p005.pdf}}</ref>

==Pathology==
The structure of lipoprotein (a) is similar to [[plasminogen]] and tPA ([[tissue plasminogen activator]]) and it competes with plasminogen for its binding site, leading to reduced fibrinolysis.  Also, because Lp(a) stimulates secretion of [[Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1|PAI-1]], it leads to [[thrombocyte|thrombogenesis]]. Lp(a) also carries [[cholesterol]] and thus contributes to [[atherosclerosis]].<ref name="pmid8499402" /><ref name=pmid16403785>{{cite journal | author = Sotiriou SN, Orlova VV, Al-Fakhri N, Ihanus E, Economopoulou M, Isermann B, Bdeir K, Nawroth PP, Preissner KT, Gahmberg CG, Koschinsky ML, Chavakis T | title = Lipoprotein(a) in atherosclerotic plaques recruits inflammatory cells through interaction with Mac-1 integrin | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 559–61 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16403785 | doi = 10.1096/fj.05-4857fje }}</ref> In addition, Lp(a) transports the more atherogenic proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids which attract inflammatory cells to vessel walls,<ref name="pmid21529331">{{cite journal | author = Gouni-Berthold I, Berthold HK | title = Lipoprotein(a): current perspectives | journal = Curr Vasc Pharmacol | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 682–92 | year = 2011 | month = November | pmid = 21529331 | doi =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid18607184">{{cite journal | author = Tsimikas S, Witztum JL | title = The role of oxidized phospholipids in mediating lipoprotein(a) atherogenicity | journal = Curr.

High Lp(a) predicts risk of early atherosclerosis independently of other cardiac risk factors, including LDL. In patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, Lp(a)indicates a coagulant risk of plaque thrombosis. Apo(a) contains domains that are very similar to plasminogen (PLG).  Lp(a) accumulates in the vessel wall and inhibits binding of PLG to the cell surface, reducing plasmin generation which increases clotting. This inhibition of PLG by Lp(a) also promotes proliferation of smooth muscle cells. These unique features of Lp(a) suggest Lp(a) causes generation of clots and atherosclerosis.<ref name=pmid11698280>{{cite journal | author = Caplice NM, Panetta C, Peterson TE, Kleppe LS, Mueske CS, Kostner GM, Broze GJ, Simari RD | title = Lipoprotein (a) binds and inactivates tissue factor pathway inhibitor: a novel link between lipoproteins and thrombosis | journal = Blood | volume = 98 | issue = 10 | pages = 2980–7 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11698280 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V98.10.2980 }}</ref>

==Diagnostic testing==
Numerous studies confirming a strong correlation between elevated Lp(a) and heart disease have led to the consensus that Lp(a) is an important, independent predictor of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref name="Nordestgaard_2010"/> Animal studies have shown that Lp(a) may directly contribute to atherosclerotic damage by increasing plaque size, inflammation, instability, and smooth muscle cell growth.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Kamstrup, PR. | title=Lipoprotein(a) should be taken much more seriously | journal=Biomarkers in Medicine | year=2009 | volume=3 | issue=5 | pages=439–441 | PMID=20477514 | doi=10.2217/bmm.09.57}}</ref> Genetic data also support the theory that Lp(a) causes cardiovascular disease.<ref name="pmid21231777"/>

The European Atherosclerosis Society currently recommends that patients with a moderate or high risk of cardiovascular disease have their lipoprotein (a) levels checked. Any patient with one of the following risk factors should be screened;
* premature cardiovascular disease
* familial hypercholesterolaemia
* family history of premature cardiovascular disease
* family history of elevated lipoprotein (a)
* recurrent cardiovascular disease despite statin treatment
* ≥3% 10-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease according to the European guidelines
* ≥10% 10-year risk of fatal and/or non-fatal cardiovascular disease according to the US guidelines<ref name="Nordestgaard_2010"/>

If the level is elevated, treatment should be initiated with a goal of bringing the level below 50&nbsp;mg/dL. In addition, the patient's other cardiovascular risk factors (including LDL levels) should be optimally managed.<ref name="Nordestgaard_2010"/>  Apart from the total Lp(a) plasma concentration, the apo(a) isoform might be an important risk parameter as well.<ref name="pmid9247362">{{cite journal | author = Klausen IC, Sjøl A, Hansen PS, Gerdes LU, Møller L, Lemming L, Schroll M, Faergeman O | title = Apolipoprotein(a) isoforms and coronary heart disease in men: a nested case-control study | journal = Atherosclerosis | volume = 132 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–84 | year = 1997 | month = July | pmid = 9247362 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9150(97)00071-3 }}</ref><ref name=pmid11116062>{{cite journal | author = Paultre F, Pearson TA, Weil HF, Tuck CH, Myerson M, Rubin J, Francis CK, Marx HF, Philbin EF, Reed RG, Berglund L | title = High levels of Lp(a) with a small apo(a) isoform are associated with coronary artery disease in African American and white men | journal = Arterioscler.

Prior studies of the relationship between LP(a) and ethnicity have shown inconsistent results. Lipoprotein (a) levels seem to differ in different populations.

==Treatment==
Currently, the recommended treatment for an elevated lipoprotein(a) is niacin, 1-3 grams daily, generally in an extended release form. Niacin therapy can reduce lipoprotein(a) levels by 20-30%. Aspirin may be beneficial as well.  A recent meta-analysis suggests that atorvastatin may also lower Lp(a) levels.<ref name ="PMID 21996415">{{cite journal | author = Takagi H | title=Atorvastatin decreases lipoprotein(a): a meta-analysis of randomized trials | journal=Int J Cardiol | year=2012 | volume =154 | issue=2 | pages=183–6 | PMID=21996415 | doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.09.060}}</ref> In severe cases, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, or treatment resistant hypercholesterolemia, lipid apheresis may result in dramatic reductions of lipoprotein(a).

Other medications that are in various stages of development include thyromimetics, cholesterol-ester-transfer protein (CETP inhibitors), anti-sense oligonucleopeptides, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors. L-carnitine may also reduce lipoprotein a levels.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Parhofer KG, et al. | title=Lipoprotein(a): medical treatment options for an elusive molecule. | journal= Curr Pharm Des.| Volume=17| Issue=9 | year=2011 | pages=871–6 | PMID =  21476974 | volume=17 | issue=9}}</ref>

The effect of estrogen on lipoprotein(a) levels is controversial.  Estrogen replacement therapy in post-menopausal women appears to be associated with lower lipoprotein(a) levels. However one large study suggested that there was a decreased association between lipoprotein(a) levels and risk.  In other words, it is unclear what a high lipoprotein(a) level means in a women on estrogen therapy.<ref name="pmid18598891">{{cite journal | author = Suk Danik J, Rifai N, Buring JE, Ridker PM | title = Lipoprotein(a), hormone replacement therapy, and risk of future cardiovascular events | journal = J.

The American Association of Pediatrics now recommends that all children be screened for cholesterol between the ages of 9 and 11.  lipoprotein(a) levels should be considered particularly in children with a family history of early heart disease or hypercholesterolemia.
