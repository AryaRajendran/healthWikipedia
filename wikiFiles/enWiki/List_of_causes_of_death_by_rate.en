{{update|date=November 2010}}

The following is a '''list of the causes of human deaths''' worldwide for the year 2002, arranged by their associated [[mortality rate]]s. There were 57,029,000 deaths tabulated for that year. Some causes listed include deaths also included in more specific subordinate causes (as indicated by the "Group" column), and some causes are omitted, so the percentages do not sum to 100. According to the [[World Health Organization]], about 58 million people died in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.who.int/cancer/en/ | year = 2005 | author = WHO | title = Cancer }}</ref>

It is estimated that of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.<ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/> In industrialized nations the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.<ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011">{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = August 7, 2011}}</ref> Thus, albeit indirectly, [[biological aging]] ([[Wiktionary:Senescence|senescence]]) is by far the leading cause of death.
