'''Alcohol tolerance''' refers to the bodily responses to the functional effects of [[ethanol]] in alcoholic beverages. This includes direct tolerance, speed of recovery from insobriety and resistance to the development of [[alcoholism]].

==Consumption-induced tolerance==
Alcohol tolerance is increased by regular drinking.<ref name=niaaa1/> This reduced sensitivity requires that higher quantities of alcohol be consumed in order to achieve the same [[drunkenness|effects]] as before tolerance was established. Alcohol tolerance may lead to (or be a sign of) alcohol dependency.<ref name=niaaa1>{{cite journal |year=1995 |month=April |title=Alcohol and Tolerance |trans_title= |journal=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), Alcohol Alert |volume= |issue=28 |pages= |id= |url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa28.htm |accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref>

Heavy alcohol consumption over a period of years can lead to "reverse tolerance". A liver can be damaged by chronic alcohol use, leading to a buildup of fat and scar tissue. The reduced ability of such a liver to [[metabolize]] or break down alcohol means that small amounts can lead to a high [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) and more rapid [[alcohol intoxication|intoxication]].

==Physiology of alcohol tolerance==
[[File:Ethanol to acetaldehyde.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Alcohol dehydrogenase]] is a dimeric zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reversible oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes]]

Direct alcohol tolerance is largely dependent on body size. Large-bodied people will require more alcohol to reach insobriety than lightly built people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Thus, men, being larger than women on average, will have a higher alcohol tolerance. The alcohol tolerance is also connected with activity of ''[[alcohol dehydrogenase]]s'' (a group of [[enzyme]]s responsible for the breakdown of alcohol) in the [[liver]], and in the bloodstream. 

High level of alcohol dehydrogenase activity results in fast transformation of ethanol to more toxic [[acetaldehyde]]. Such atypical alcohol dehydrogenase levels are less frequent in alcoholics than in nonalcoholics and, alongside other symptoms, can indicate various forms of liver disease.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Furthermore, among alcoholics, the carriers of this atypical enzyme consume lower ethanol doses, compared to the individuals without the [[allele]].

==Alcohol tolerance in different ethnic groups==
{{See also|Race and health|Genetic epidemiology}}

The tolerance to alcohol is not equally distributed throughout the world's population, and genetics of [[Alcohol_dehydrogenase|alcohol dehydrogenas]]e indicate resistance has arisen independently in different ethnic groups.<ref name=Pakstis/> People of European descent on average have a high alcohol tolerance and are less likely to develop [[alcoholism]] compared to Aboriginal Australians, and Native Americans.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0893-164X.15.4.306 |title=Binge drinking in Chinese, Korean, and White college students: Genetic and ethnic group differences |year=2001 |last1=Luczak |first1=Susan E. |last2=Wall |first2=Tamara L. |last3=Shea |first3=Shoshana H. |last4=Byun |first4=Susan M. |last5=Carr |first5=Lucinda G. |journal=Psychology of Addictive Behaviors |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=306–9 |pmid=11767261}}</ref><ref>Mail ''& al.''
