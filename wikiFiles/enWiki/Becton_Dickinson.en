'''Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD)''' is an [[United States|American]] [[medical technology]] company that manufactures and sells medical devices, instrument systems and reagents. Founded in 1897 and [[Becton, Dickinson and Company headquarters|headquartered]] in [[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]], BD employs nearly 30,000 people in more than 50 countries throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:BDX|title=Google Finance:BDX}}</ref> In fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, 60% of BD sales were generated from non-U.S. markets.

The company's customers include healthcare institutions, science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public. BD was one of the first companies to sell U.S.-made glass syringes. It was also a pioneer in the production of hypodermic needles. Today, BD is divided into three segments: BD Medical, BD Diagnostics and BD Biosciences.<ref>Becton, Dickinson and Co Stock Report, Standard & Poor's, January 30, 2010</ref> BD was ranked 347 and 312, respectively, in the 2009 and 2010 [[Fortune 500]] list.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2009/snapshots/51.html|title=CNN Money Fortune 500 list}}</ref>

==Historical development==
===1897–1947===
BD was founded in 1897 by [[Maxwell Becton|Maxwell W. Becton]] and  [[Fairleigh S. Dickinson]], two American businessmen who met on a sales trip. The same year the company made its first sale, a Luer-all-glass [[syringe]] that sold for $2.50. In 1898 BD acquired its first [[patent]] for a medical product. In 1899 the company introduced its first logo which was meant to symbolize guaranteed superior quality of the products provided by BD. In 1904 BD acquired the Philadelphia Surgical Company. This very first acquisition and other early acquisitions significantly expanded the company’s manufacturing ability and product offering. Two years later BD incorporated in the State of [[New Jersey]] and built a manufacturing facility in [[East Rutherford]], the first in the U.S. created specifically for the production of [[thermometer]]s, [[hypodermic needles]], and syringes. In 1924 BD manufactured its first syringe designed specifically for [[insulin]] injection. One year later BD introduced the BD Yale Luer-Lok Syringe, designed and patented by Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Sr. It provided a simple and secure method of attaching and removing the needle to and from the syringe. Today, [[luer lock]] connectors are the standard for syringes in the U.S. In 1947 Joseph Kleiner developed the Evacutainer — a device used to draw blood by vacuum through a needle into a test tube. This product eventually evolved to become the BD [[Vacutainer]] Blood Collection system.<ref name=hist>{{cite web|url=http://www.bd.com/aboutbd/history/|title=BD Milestones}}</ref>

===1948–1970===
In 1948 BD faced new leadership as [[Fairleigh Dickinson, Jr.|Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr.]] and Henry P. Becton, sons of the founders, took over the company. Their 24-year tenure was a time of rapid development for BD. The company grew within the U.S. as well as internationally. In 1949 it opened its first manufacturing site outside of New Jersey in [[Columbus Nebraska|Columbus]], [[Nebraska]]. In 1961 it established a manufacturing facility in [[Canaan, Connecticut|Canaan]], [[Connecticut]]. BD also soon expanded to [[Canada]] (1951), [[Mexico]] (1952), [[France]] (1955), and [[Brazil]] (1956). The tenure of Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr. and Henry P. Becton was also a time of significant product innovation. In 1950 BD's first sterile disposable product, a blood collection set, was developed and sold to the American Red Cross. In 1954 BD introduced the first completely disposable syringe made of glass: BD Hypak. This innovative product was used in a large-scale field test of the [[polio]] [[vaccine]] developed by [[Jonas Salk|Dr. Jonas Salk]]. One year later, BD entered the [[microbiology]] field through the acquisition of the Baltimore Biological Laboratory. In 1961 the company introduced its disposable BD Plastipak syringe. Under the new leadership the company also went public (1962) and was appeared for the first time in the [[Fortune 500]] list (1970).<ref name=hist />

===1973–1995===
In 1973 BD added another U.S. facility —a research center in [[Durham, North Carolina]] in [[Research Triangle Park]]. The center was established to help the company meet [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) requirements, research improved manufacturing and process methods, and develop future innovative technologies. In 1975 BD Pharmaceutical Systems Europe acquired an important patent for a prefilled syringe injecting [[heparin]]. In 1980 BD developed its first automated system for [[mycobacteria]] testing, the BD BACTEC 460TB System. The next year brought significant signs of the company’s development as sales surpassed the $1 billion milestone and a new plant in [[Plymouth]], [[England]] was constructed to serve the European markets. Five years later BD moved its corporate headquarters to [[Franklin Lakes]], [[New Jersey]] ([[Becton, Dickinson and Company headquarters|current HQ location]].) Also in 1986, BD acquired Fabersanitas Industrial, a major Spanish syringe manufacturer as well as Deseret Medical, a [[vascular]] access devices manufacturer. The last three years of the 1980s also showed growth in Asia (manufacturing facilities in [[Singapore]] and [[Japan]].) Furthermore, BD became the first company to introduce a safety-engineered syringe — BD Safety-Lok (1988) and acquired the Beaver Blade Company, a manufacturer of high-quality surgical blades. The first half of the next decade was very important to BD’s development. The company opened a central distribution center in [[Temse]], [[Belgium]] (1992) and entered [[India]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] (1995.) BD also introduced a device that offered needle stick protection following [[Venipuncture|blood-drawing]] procedures — BD Vacutainer Safety-Lok Blood Collection Set.<ref name=hist />

===1999–2006===
In 1999, as BD passed more than 100 years of presence in the medical devices industry, BD announced its new [[corporate identity]]. Numerous independent brand names were replaced by a single name: BD. In addition, the company symbol that is used today was introduced. BD also named Edward J. Ludwig as the company’s [[president]]. Ludwig was also named [[Chief Executive Officer]] (2000) and [[chairman|Chairman of the Board of Directors]] (2002.) During that time BD also got heavily involved in global health issues announcing a five-year maternal and neonatal tetanus world-wide elimination partnership with [[UNICEF]] (1999), launching the BD Safety Compliance Initiative (2000), and pledging $1 million contribution to the [[International AIDS Vaccine Initiative]] (2002.) In 2003 and 2004 BD introduced several innovative products: BD FACSAria Cell Sorterthe — first entirely new instrument in the next-generation portfolio of flow cytometers (2003), BD Accuspray — a nasal drug delivery system for administering vaccines (2003), BD.id — a patient identification system designed to limit the potential for medical errors in [[Laboratory specimen|specimen]] collection (2003), and the world's first "intelligent" [[insulin pump]] and [[Blood glucose monitoring|glucose monitoring]] system, a wireless system consisting of a Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm 512 Insulin Pump and Paradigm Link Blood Glucose Monitor, co-developed with BD. In the beginning of the 21st century BD also invested in growing its business by acquiring several strategically important companies. In 2001 it acquired the Gentest Corporation, a leading in drug metabolism and toxicology testing company. In 2004 BD completed the acquisition of Atto Bioscience Acquired, a company specializing in [[optical]] instrumentation, software, and [[reagents]] for real-time analysis of interactions taking place in living [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. In 2005 BD entered the field of [[proteomics]] through its acquisition of FFE Weber GmbH, which specialized in the [[separation process|separation]] and [[fractionation]] of complex proteins. 2006 was also important to BD growth as the company acquired GeneOhm Sciences — a leader in the development of [[molecular]] diagnostic testing for the rapid detection of [[bacterial]] organisms and TriPath Imaging —a [[cancer]] diagnostics company.<ref name=hist />
