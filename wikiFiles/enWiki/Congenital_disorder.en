A '''congenital disorder''', or '''congenital disease''', is a condition existing at [[birth]] and often before birth, or that develops during the first month of life ([[neonatal]] disease), regardless of causation. Of these diseases, those characterized by structural deformities are termed "congenital anomalies" and involve defects in or damage to a developing [[fetus]].

A congenital disorder may be the result of [[Genetics|genetic]] abnormalities, the intrauterine ([[uterus]]) environment, errors of [[morphogenesis]], [[infection]], or a [[chromosomal]] abnormality. The outcome of the disorder will depend on complex interactions between the [[prenatal|pre-natal]] deficit and the [[postnatal|post-natal]] environment.<ref name="cdc">[http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/bd/research.htm Birth Defects Research]. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</ref> Animal studies indicate that the mother's (and possibly the father's) diet, [[vitamin]] intake, and [[glucose]] levels ''prior'' to [[ovulation]] and conception have long-term effects on fetal growth and adolescent and adult disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/display/article/10162/1532211   |title=Pre-Prenatal Care: A Primary Care Primer on the Future |author=Gregory W.

Any substance that causes birth defects is known as a [[teratogen]]. 

The older term ''congenital''<ref>{{cite book |title=Webster's Dictionary |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/congenital  |accessdate=}}</ref> disorder does not necessarily refer to a [[genetic disorder|''genetic'' disorder]] despite the similarity of the words.  Some disorders can be detected before birth through [[prenatal diagnosis]] (screening).

==Classification==
Much of the language used for describing congenital conditions predates genomic mapping, and structural conditions are often considered separately from other congenital conditions. It is now known that many metabolic conditions may have subtle structural expression, and structural conditions often have genetic links. Still, congenital conditions are often classified in a structural basis, organized when possible by primary organ system affected.

===Primarily structural===
{{main|Congenital abnormality}}
Several terms are used to describe congenital abnormalities. (Some of these are also used to describe noncongenital conditions, and more than one term may apply in an individual condition.)

* A '''congenital physical anomaly''' is an abnormality of the structure of a body part. An anomaly may or may not be perceived as a problem condition. Many, if not most, people have one or more [[minor physical anomalies]] if examined carefully. Examples of minor anomalies can include curvature of the 5th finger ([[clinodactyly]]), a third nipple, tiny indentations of the skin near the ears (preauricular pits), shortness of the 4th [[metacarpal]] or [[metatarsal]] bones, or dimples over the lower spine ([[sacral dimple]]s). Some minor anomalies may be clues to more significant internal abnormalities.
* '''Birth defect''' is a widely used term for a congenital malformation, i.e. a congenital, physical anomaly which is recognizable at [[birth]], and which is significant enough to be considered a problem. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], most [[birth defects]] are believed to be caused by a complex mix of factors including genetics, environment, and behaviors,<ref name="cdc"/> though many birth defects have no known cause. An example of a birth defect is [[cleft palate]].
* A '''congenital malformation''' is a [[congenital]] physical anomaly that is deleterious, i.e. a structural defect perceived as a problem. A typical combination of malformations affecting more than one body part is referred to as a [[malformation syndrome]].
* Some conditions are due to abnormal tissue development:
** A '''malformation''' is associated with a disorder of tissue development.<ref name="isbn0-7216-1489-2">{{cite book |author=Graham, John Whichello |title=Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Deformation, 3rd Edition |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2007 |pages=3 |isbn=0-7216-1489-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Malformations often occur in the first trimester.
** A '''[[dysplasia]]''' is a disorder at the organ level that is due to problems with tissue development.<ref name="isbn0-7216-1489-2"/>
* It is also possible for conditions to arise after tissue is formed:
** A '''[[deformity|deformation]]''' is a condition arising from mechanical stress to normal tissue.<ref name="isbn0-7216-1489-2"/> Deformations often occur in the second or third trimester, and can be due to [[oligohydramnios]].
* A '''disruption''' involves breakdown of normal tissues.<ref name="isbn0-7216-1489-2"/>
* When multiple effects occur in a specified order, it is known as a [[Sequence (medicine)|sequence]]. When the order is not known, it is a [[syndrome]].

===Other===
*'''[[Genetic disorder]]s''' or diseases are all congenital, though they may not be expressed or recognized until later in life. Genetic diseases may be divided into single-gene defects, multiple-gene disorders, or chromosomal defects. Single-gene defects may arise from abnormalities of both copies of an [[autosome|autosomal]] gene (a [[Dominance relationship#Recessive allele|recessive]] disorder) or of only one of the two copies (a [[Dominance relationship#Dominant allele|dominant]] disorder). Some conditions result from deletions or abnormalities of a few genes located contiguously on a chromosome. Chromosomal disorders involve the loss or duplication of larger portions of a chromosome (or an entire chromosome) containing hundreds of genes. Large chromosomal abnormalities always produce effects on many different body parts and organ systems.
* A '''congenital metabolic disease''' is also referred to as an [[inborn error of metabolism]]. Most of these are single gene defects, usually heritable. Many affect the structure of body parts but some simply affect the function.
* Other well defined genetic conditions may affect the production of hormones, receptors, structural proteins, and ion channels.

==Causes==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}

===Antibiotics===
Use of [[antibiotics]] around the time of [[Fertilisation|conception]], particularly [[sulfonamides]] and [[nitrofurantoin]] are associated with major birth defects.  Whether or not this association is causal has not been determined.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Crider KS, Cleves MA, Reefhuis J, Berry RJ, Hobbs CA, Hu DJ |title=Antibacterial medication use during pregnancy and risk of birth defects: National Birth Defects Prevention Study |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=163 |issue=11 |pages=978–85 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19884587 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.188 |url=}}</ref>

Cell division errors can be due to a lack of nutrients or availability of atomic building blocks, or the presence of [[toxins]] that impede normal growth. Division errors which occur very early in the development of a multicellular organism can result in large scale structural and functional differences in the organism's final shape. For example it is now understood that a lack of [[folic acid]] in the diet of a mother can cause cellular [[neural tube]] deformities that result in [[Spina Bifida]].

External physical shocks or constrainment due to growth in a restricted space, may result in unintended deformation or separation of cellular structures resulting in an abnormal final shape or damaged structures unable to function as expected.

For multicellular organisms that develop in a [[womb]], the physical interference or presence of other similarly developing organisms such as [[twins]] can result in the two cellular masses being integrated into a larger whole, with the combined cells attempting to continue to develop in a matter that satisfies the intended growth patterns of both cell masses. The two cellular masses can compete with each other, and may either duplicate or merge various structures. This results in conditions such as [[conjoined twins]], and the resulting merged organism may die at birth when it must leave the life-sustaining environment of the womb and must attempt to sustain its biological processes independently.

===Relationship of congenital anomalies with sex===
Many studies have found that the frequency of occurrence of certain congenital malformations depends on the sex of the child (table).<ref>Gittelsohn A., Milham S.

Among children with one kidney, there are approximately twice as many males, whereas among children with three kidneys there are approximately 2.5 times more females. The same pattern is observed among infants with excessive number of ribs, vertebrae, teeth and other organs which in a process of evolution have undergone reduction—among them there are more females. Contrary, among the infants with their scarcity, there are more males. Anencephaly is shown to occur approximately twice as frequently in females.<ref name="WHO reports">World Health Organization reports). “Congenital malformations”, Geneve, 1966, p. 128.</ref> The number of boys born with 6 fingers is two times higher than the number of girls.<ref>Darwin C.

P. M. Rajewski and A. L. Sherman (1976) have analyzed the frequency of congenital anomalies in relation to the system of the organism. Prevalence of men was recorded for the anomalies of phylogenetically younger organs and systems.<ref name="Rajewski">Rajewski P. M., Sherman A. L.

In respect of an etiology, sexual distinctions can be divided on appearing before and after differentiation of male's gonads in during embryonic development, which begins from eighteenth week. The testosterone level in male embryos thus raises considerably.<ref>Reyes F.I., Boroditsky R.S., Winter J.S., Faiman C. (1974) Studies on human sexual development. II. Fetal and maternal serum gonadotropin and sex steroid concentrations. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. '''38''' p. 612– 617.</ref> The subsequent hormonal and physiological distinctions of male and female embryos can explain some sexual differences in frequency of congenital defects. It is difficult to explain the observed differences in the frequency of birth defects between the sexes by the details of the reproductive functions or the influence of environmental and social factors.

==Fossil record==
{{Main|Paleopathology}}
Evidence for congenital deformities found in the fossil record is studied by [[paleopathologists]], specialists in ancient disease and injury. Fossils bearing evidence of congenital deformity are scientifically significant because they can help scientists infer the evolutionary history of life's developmental processes. For instance, because a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' specimen has been discovered with a [[block vertebra]], it means that vertebrae have been developing the same basic way since at least the most recent common ancestor of dinosaurs and mammals. Other notable fossil deformities include a hatchling specimen of the bird-like dinosaur, ''[[Troodon]]'', the tip of whose jaw was twisted.<ref name="molnar-pathology">Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic  Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University  Press, p. 337-363.</ref> Another notably deformed fossil was a specimen of the [[choristodere]] ''[[Hyphalosaurus]]'', which had two heads- the oldest known example of [[polycephaly]].<ref>Ji Q., Wu, X.-C. and Cheng, Y.-N.
