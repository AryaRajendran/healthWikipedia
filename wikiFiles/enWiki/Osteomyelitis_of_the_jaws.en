'''Osteomyelitis of the jaws''' is [[osteomyelitis]] (which is [[inflammation]] of the [[bone marrow]], sometimes abbreviated to OM) which occurs in the bones of the jaws (i.e. [[maxilla]] or the [[human mandible|mandible]]). Historically, osteomyelitis of the jaws was a common complication of [[odontogenic infection]] (infections of the teeth). Before the antibiotic era, it was frequently a fatal condition.<ref name="Peravali 2011">{{cite journal|last=Peravali|first=Ranjit Kumar|coauthors=Jayade, Bhushan; Joshi, Abhijit; Shirganvi, Mahantesh; Bhasker Rao, C.; Gopalkrishnan, K.|title=Osteomyelitis of Maxilla in Poorly Controlled Diabetics in a Rural Indian Population|journal=Journal of Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery|date=1 October 2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=57–66|doi=10.1007/s12663-011-0283-0|pmid=23449555}}</ref> 

==Classification==
The classification is similar to the [[osteomyelitis#Classification|classification of OM]] generally, according to the length of time the inflammation has been present and whether there is [[suppuration]] (the formation of [[pus]]). ''Acute osteomyelitis'' is loosely defined as OM which has been present for less than one month and ''chronic osteomyelitis'' is the term used for when the condition lasts for more than one month. Suppurative osteomyelitis of the jaws is uncommon in developed regions, and more common in developing countries. In Europe and the United states, most cases follow dental infections or [[mandibular fracture]]s. There have been many reported cases occurring in Africa which are coexistent with [[acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis]] or [[cancrum oris]].<ref name="Neville 2001">{{cite book|last=Neville BW, Damm DD, Allen CA, Bouquot JE.|first=|title=Oral & maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B.

In the pre-antibiotic era, acute OM of the jaws was more extensive. Massive, diffuse infections commonly involved the whole side of the mandible, or the whole of one side and the opposite side as far as the [[mental foramen]]. Localized osteomyelitis tended to be described as either ''vertical'', where a short segment of the body of the mandible from the alveolar crest to the lower border was involved, and ''alveolar'', where a segment of [[alveolus|alveolar bone]] down to the level of the inferior alveolar canal would sequestrate, including the sockets of several teeth. Treatment with antibiotics has significantly altered the [[natural history]] of OM of the jaws.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms depend upon the type of OM, and may include:

* Pain, which is severe, throbbing and deep seated.
* Swelling. External swelling is initially due to inflammatory [[edema]] with accompanying [[erythema]] (redness), heat and tenderness, and then later may be due to sub-periosteal pus accumulation. Eventually, subperiosteal bone formation may give a firm swelling.
* [[Trismus]] (difficulty opening the mouth), which may be present in some cases and is caused by edema in the muscles.
* [[dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing), which may be present in some cases and is caused by edema in the muscles.
* Cervical [[lymphadenitis]] (swelling of the [[lymph node]]s in the neck).
* [[Aesthesia]] or [[paresthesia]] (altered sensation such as numbness or pins and needles) in the distribution of the [[mental nerve]].
* [[Fever]] which may be present in the acute phase and is high and intermittent
* [[Malaise]] (general feeling of being unwell) which may be present in the acute phase
* [[Anorexia]] (loss of appatite).
* [[Leukocytosis]] (elevated numbers of [[white blood cell]]s) which may be present in the acute phase
* Elevated [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] and [[C reactive protein]] are sometimes present.
* An obvious cause in the mouth (usually) such as a decayed tooth.
* Teeth that are tender to percussion, which may develop as the condition progresses
* Loosening of teeth, which may develop as the condition progresses.
* Pus may later be visible, which exudes from around the necks of teeth, from an open socket, or from other sites within the mouth or on the skin over the involved bone.
* Fetid odor.

Unlike acute OM in the long bones, acute OM in the jaws gives only a moderate systemic reaction and the person remains surprisingly well. Acute OM of the jaws may give a similar appearance to a typical odontogenic infection, but [[cellulitis]] does not tend to spread from the periosteal envelope of the involved bone. If the infection is not controlled, the process becomes chronic and systemic symptoms are usually absent and draining fistulas, loosening of teeth and sequestra formation. Untreated chronic osteomyelitis tends to feature occasional acute exacerbations.

==Etiopathogenesis==
OM is usually a polymicrobial, [[opportunistic infection]], caused primarily by a mixture of [[Streptococcus#Alpha-hemolytic|alpha hemolytic streptococci]] and [[anaerobic bacteria]] from the [[oral cavity]] such as ''[[Peptostreptococcus]]'', ''[[Fusobacterium]]'' and ''[[Prevotella]]'', (in contrast to OM of the long bones, usually caused by isolated ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' infection). These are the same as the common causative organisms in odotonogenic infections. However, when OM in the jaws follows trauma, is the likely cause is still staphylococcal (usually ''[[Staphylococcus epidermis]]''.<ref name="Topazian 2002" />

OM may occur either because of spread of an adjacent area of infection or by seeding of the infection from a non adjacent site via the blood supply (hematogenous spread). Unlike OM of the [[long bone]]s, hematogenous OM in the bones of the jaws is rare. OM of the jaws is mainly caused by spread of adjacent odontogenic infection. The second most common cause is a traumatic fracture, usually of the mandible and usually following a compound fracture (i.e. one that communicates with the mouth or the external environment). In OM of the long bones, a single invading [[pathogenic]] [[micro-organism]] is usually found (commonly [[staphylococci]] spp.).<ref name="Topazian 2002" /> 

The mandible is affected more commonly than the maxilla. This is thought to be related to the differences in blood supply between the mandible and the maxilla. The maxilla has a better blood supply, and has thin cortical plates and less medullary spaces. These factors mean that infections of the maxilla are not readily confined to the bone, and readily dissipate edema and pus into the surrounding soft tissues and the [[paranasal air sinuses]]. OM of the maxilla may rarely occur during an uncontrolled infection of the [[middle ear]] or in infants who have sustained birth injury due to forceps. The mandible in contrast has a relatively poor blood supply, which deteriorates with increasing age. The cortical plates are thick and there is a medullary cavity. The sites of the mandible most commonly affected by OM are (decreasing order of frequency) the body, the symphysis, the angle, the [[ramus of the mandible|ramus]] and finally the condyle. The mandible's blood supply is primarily via the [[inferior alveolar artery]], and secondarily via the [[periosteum]]. Compromise of this supply is a critical factor in the development of OM in the mandible.<ref name="Topazian 2002" /> 

Most periapical and periodontal infections are isolated by the body which produces a protective pyogenic membrane or abscess wall to keep the area of infection localized. Micro-organisms which are sufficiently virulent may destroy this barrier. Factors which may contribute to this are decreased host resistance, surgery or repeated movement of fracture segments, as may occur with an untreated fracture. Mechanical trauma burnishes the bone, causing [[ischemia]] by crushing [[blood vessel]]s and seeds micro-organisms into the tissues.<ref name="Topazian 2002">{{cite book|last=Topazian RG, Goldberg MH, Hupp JR|title=Oral and maxillofacial infections|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0721692715|pages=214–235|edition=4th}}</ref>

The events preceding OM are acute inflammatory changes such as [[hyperemia]], increased [[capillary]] permeability and infiltration of [[granulocyte]]s. [[Proteolytic]] [[enzyme]]s are released, and [[thrombus]] formation in the blood vessels and tissue [[necrosis]] occur. Pus accumulates in the medullary spaces of the bone, which increases the pressure and leads to collapse of the blood vessels, venous stasis and ischemia. Pus may also spread to the sub-pperiosteal layer, dissecting it away from the surface of the bone and further reducing the blood supply. The inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle is compressed withing the mandible, causing [[anesthesia]] or [[paresthesia]] in the distribution of the [[mental nerve]]. Pus may drain via sinuses on the skin and in the mouth, and these may in time become lined with [[epithelium]], when they are termed [[fistula]]s.<ref name="Topazian 2002" /> 

Chronic OM is characterized by a degree of healing which takes place as a lesser degree of inflammation is present. [[Granulation tissue]] and new blood vessels form, and fragments of necrotic bone ([[sequestrum|sequestra]]) are separated from vital bone. Small sections of necrotic bone may be resorbed completely, and larger segments may become surrounded by granulation tissue and new bone (an involucrum). Sequestra may also be revascularized by new blood vessels, cause no symptoms or become chronically infected. Sometimes the involucrum is penetrated by channels (cloacae) through which pus drains to the skin or mouth.<ref name="Topazian 2002" />

OM of the jaws usually occurs in the presence of one or more predisposing factors. These factors are related to compromised vascular perfusion locally, regionally or systemically, causes of [[immunocompromise]] and poor wound healing. Specific examples include [[diabetes]], [[autoimmunity|automimmune disease]]s, [[Agranulocytosis]], [[leukemia]], severe [[anemia]], [[syphilis]], [[chemotherapy]], [[corticosteroid]] therapy, [[sickle cell disease]], [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]], old age, [[malnutrition]], smoking and alcohol consumption, [[radiotherapy]], [[osteoporosis]], [[Paget's disease of bone]], [[fibrous dysplasia]], bone [[malignant|malignancy]] and causes of bone necrosis such as [[Bismuth]], [[Mercury]] or [[arsenic]]. Poor compliance or access to health care is also a risk factor.<ref name="Topazian 2002" />

Rarely, OM of the jaws may be a complication of [[trgeminal herpes zoster]].

==Prevention==

==Treatment==
[[Culture and sensitivity]] of the wound site determines the choice of antibiotic. Repeated culture and sensitivity testing is often carried out in OM since the treatment is prolonged and [[antibiotic resistance]] may occur, when a change in the drug may be required.<ref name="Topazian 2002" />

==Prognosis==
[[Pathologic fracture]] of the mandible is a possible complication of OM where the bone has been weakened significantly.

==Epidemiology==
OM of the jaws usually occurs in adult males. The mandible is affected more commonly than the maxilla. The most common cause of OM of the jaws is the spread of adjacent [[odontogenic infection]]. The second most common cause is following a fracture, usually of the mandible.
