'''The Anaphylaxis Campaign''' is the only UK charity to exclusively meet the needs of the growing numbers of people at risk from severe allergic reactions by providing information and support relating to foods and other triggers such as latex, drugs and insect stings.<ref>[http://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk The Anaphylaxis Campaign]</ref>

==Mission==
The Campaign aims to create a safe environment for all people living with allergy by educating the food industry, schools, pre-schools, colleges, health professionals and other key audiences. Its focus is on medical facts, food labelling, risk reduction and allergen management. The Campaign provides online training resources for families, carers and health professionals, a helpline, factsheets and other literature, as well as running support groups and workshops.

==Origins and key personalities==

==National lobbying==
The Anaphylaxis Campaign is a founder member of the National Allergy Strategy Group,<ref>[http://www.nasguk.org/AboutUs_Aims.html National Allergy Strategy Group]</ref> a coalition of charities, professional organisations and industry, that seeks to improve health services for allergy sufferers in the UK.

The Anaphylaxis Campaign has called for clearer guidelines and greater consistency on food labelling.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/apr/24/experts-warn-crying-wolf-nut-allergies Experts warn of 'crying wolf' over nut allergies, The Guardian, 24 April 2010]</ref> It has also lobbied to remove what it considers to be unnecessary 'may contain' labelling, arguing that food manufacturers should only use these labels when there is a genuine risk to allergy sufferers.<ref>[http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Food-Safety/May-contain-allergen-labels-will-be-more-consistent 'May contain' allergy labels will be more consistent, Food Manufacture, 5 July 2012]</ref>

The Anaphylaxis Campaign has tried to raise awareness of the problems caused by inconsistency in how severe allergy is diagnosed.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/apr/16/health.healthandwellbeing Big rise in patients with deadline allergies, The Observer, 16 April 2006]</ref> To help improve awareness among frontline medical practitioners, it launched an online training programme, called AllergyWise,<ref>[http://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk/living-with-anaphylaxis/allergywise-online-training AllergyWise online training, Anaphylaxis Campaign]</ref> in 2011, accredited by the [[Royal College of Nursing]].<ref>[http://www.rcn.org.uk/development/learning/accreditation/resources/elearning/resources/online_anaphylaxis_training_for_healthcare_professionals AllergyWise online training and resources for health care professionals, Royal College of Nursing]</ref>

In March 2011, the Anaphylaxis Campaign held a national conference with the [[Food Standards Agency]], the UK government department, on 'Communicating the science of food allergy'.<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/publication/fsaenews0311.pdf, Food Standards Agency e-newsletter, March 2011]</ref>
