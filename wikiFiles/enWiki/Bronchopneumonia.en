'''Bronchopneumonia''' or '''bronchial pneumonia''' or '''Bronchogenic pneumonia''' (not to be confused with [[lobar pneumonia]])<ref>{{DorlandsDict|two/000014753|bronchopneumonia}}</ref> is the acute [[inflammation]] of the walls of the [[bronchiole]]s. It is a type of [[pneumonia]] characterized by multiple foci of isolated, acute consolidation, affecting one or more [[pulmonary]] lobules.  

It is one of two types of [[bacterial pneumonia]] as classified by gross anatomic distribution of consolidation (solidification), the other being ''[[lobar pneumonia]]''.<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=749}}</ref>

==Associated conditions==
Bronchopneumonia is less likely than lobar pneumonia to be associated with [[Streptococcus]].<ref name="urlLobar Pneumonia">{{cite web |url=http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/medicine/PULMONAR/cxr/atlas/pneumonia.htm |title=Lobar Pneumonia |work= |accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref> 

The bronchopneumonia pattern has been associated with [[hospital-acquired pneumonia]], and with specific organisms such as [[Staphylococcus aureus]], [[Klebsiella]], [[E. coli]], and [[Pseudomonas]].<ref name="urlPulmonary Pathology">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/LUNGHTML/LUNG007.html |title=Pulmonary Pathology |work= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref>

In bacterial pneumonia, invasion of the lung [[parenchyma]] by bacteria produces an [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] immune response.  This response leads to a filling of the alveolar sacs with [[exudate]].  The loss of air space and its replacement with fluid is called consolidation.  In bronchopneumonia, or lobular pneumonia, there are multiple foci of isolated, acute consolidation, affecting one or more [[pulmonary]] lobes.

Although these two patterns of pneumonia, lobar and lobular, are the classic anatomic categories of [[bacterial pneumonia]], in clinical practice the types are difficult to apply, as the patterns usually overlap.  Bronchopneumonia (lobular) often leads to lobar pneumonia as the infection progresses.  The same organism may cause one type of pneumonia in one patient, and another in a different patient.  From the clinical standpoint, far more important than distinguishing the anatomical subtype of pneumonia, is identifying its causative agent and accurately assessing the extent of the disease.

== Pathology ==
Multiple [[focus (geometry)|foci]] of consolidation are present in the basal lobes of the [[human lung]], often bilateral. These lesions are 2–4&nbsp;cm in diameter, grey-yellow, dry, often centered on a [[bronchiole]], poorly delimited, and with the tendency to confluence, especially in children.

A focus of inflammatory condensation is centered on a [[bronchiole]] with acute bronchiolitis (suppurative exudate - [[pus]] - in the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] and parietal inflammation). Alveolar lumens surrounding the bronchiole are filled with neutrophils ("leukocytic alveolitis"). Massive congestion is present. Inflammatory foci are separated by normal, aerated parenchyma.

== Deaths ==

*[[King Edward VI]] of England is believed to have died of bronchopneumonia in [[1553]].
*[[Carlos Bulosan]], novelist died of bronchopneumonia.
*[[Rosalind Franklin]] is believed to have died of bronchopneumonia, along with 2 other diseases.
*[[Freddie Mercury]], the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen, died on November 24, 1991 of AIDS-related bronchopneumonia.
*Actor [[Gregory Peck]] died on June 12, 2003 of bronchopneumonia.
