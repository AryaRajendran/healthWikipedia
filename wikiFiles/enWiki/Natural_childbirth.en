'''Natural childbirth''' is a philosophy of [[childbirth]] that is based on the belief that women who are adequately prepared are innately able to give birth without routine medical interventions. Natural childbirth arose in opposition to the techno-medical model of childbirth that has recently gained popularity in industrialized societies, and is a childbirth philosophy that attempts to minimize medical intervention, particularly the use of anesthetic medications and surgical interventions such as [[episiotomies]], forceps and [[ventouse]] deliveries and [[caesarean section]]s. A woman's definition of 'natural' may range from no intervention at all to birth which includes any intervention deemed appropriate. The application of this philosophy may occur during a physician or midwife attended [[hospital birth]], a midwife attended homebirth, or an unassisted birth.The term "natural childbirth" was coined by obstetrician [[Grantly Dick-Read]] upon publication of his book ''Natural Childbirth'' in the 1930s, which was followed by the 1942 ''Childbirth Without Fear''.

==History==
Historically, most women gave birth at home without emergency medical care available. The "natural" rate of maternal mortality—where nothing is done to prevent maternal death—has been estimated at 1500 per 100,000 births. In the United States circa 1900, before the introduction and improvement of modern medical technologies, there were about 700 maternal deaths per 100,000 births (.7%).<ref name="vanlerberghe">Van Lerberghe W, De Brouwere V. ''Of blind alleys and things that have worked: history’s lessons on reducing maternal mortality.'' In: De Brouwere V, Van Lerberghe W, eds. ''Safe motherhood strategies: a review of the evidence''. Antwerp, ITG Press, 2001 (Studies in Health Services Organisation and Policy, 17:7–33).  "Where nothing effective is done to avert maternal death, “natural” mortality is probably of the order of magnitude of 1,500/100,000...In the USA of 1900, for example, there were about 700 maternal deaths for 100,000 births"</ref> (However, natural childbirth advocates recognize the importance of emergency medical intervention, which can avert maternal or neonatal death.) 

At the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, giving birth at home became more difficult due to congested living spaces and dirty living conditions. This drove urban and lower class women to newly available hospitals, while wealthy and middle-class women continued to labor at home.<ref name=Cassidy>{{cite book|last = Cassidy|first = Tina|title =  Birth|publisher= Atlantic Monthly Press|location= New York|year= 2006|pages = 54–55 |isbn = 0-87113-938-3}}</ref> In the early 1900s there was an increasing availability of hospitals, and more women began going into the hospital for labor and delivery. In the United States, the middle classes were especially receptive to the medicalization of childbirth, which seemed to promise a safer and less painful labor.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite journal |year = 2005 |title =  Consumer Risk Perceptions in a Community of Reflexive Doubt |journal = Journal of Consumer Research|volume = 32|pages = 235–248 |doi =  10.1086/432233 |author =  Thompson, Craig J. |authormask = Thompson, C.J. |issue = 2}}</ref>  In fact, the ability to labor without pain was part of the early feminist movement{{ref|Cassidy}}. With this change from primarily homebirth to primarily hospital birth came changes in the care women received during labor: although no longer the case, in the 1940s it was common for women to be routinely sedated and for babies to be delivered from their unconscious mothers with forceps (termed by Dr. Robert A. Bradley as "knock-em-out, drag-em-out obstetrics"). Other routine obstetric interventions have similarly come and gone: shaving of the mother's pubic region; mandatory intravenous drips; enemas; hand strapping of the laboring women; and the 12 hour monitoring of newborns in a nursery away from the mother. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Beginning in the 1940s, childbirth professionals and mothers began to challenge the conventional assumptions about the safety of medicalized births. Physicians [[Michel Odent]] and [[Frederick Leboyer]] and midwives such as [[Ina May Gaskin]] promoted [[birthing center]]s, [[water birth]], and [[homebirth]] as alternatives to the hospital model. Some research has shown that low-tech midwifery provides labor outcomes as good as or better than those found in hospital settings with fewer interventions, except for a small percentage of high-risk cases.<ref>{{cite journal |year = 1992|title =  The Safety of Home Birth: The Farm Study |journal = American Journal of Public Health|volume = 82|pages = 450–452 |doi = 10.2105/AJPH.82.3.450 |author = Duran, A M |authormask = Durand, Mark A. |issue = 3}}</ref>

==Psychological aspects==
Many women consider natural birth empowering.<ref>''Having a Great Birth in Australia'', [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], Australian College of Midwives, 2005</ref>  A woman who is supported to labour as she instinctively wants to, is a woman who will likely feel positive about her birth experience and future parenting skills.  Her baby is more able to be alert and placed on her skin (promoting [[maternal bond]]ing) and breastfeeding is more likely to be enjoyable and successful.<ref>{{cite book |year = 2004 |title =  The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding|publisher = La Leche League International|authormask = La Leche League International }}</ref>  Studies show that skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn immediately after birth is beneficial for both mother and baby.  A review done by the [[World Health Organization]] found that skin-to-skin contact between mothers and babies after birth reduces crying, improves mother-infant interaction, and helps mothers to breastfeed successfully.  They recommend that [[neonates]] be allowed to bond with the mother during their first two hours after birth, the period that they tend to be more alert than in the following hours of early life.<ref>http://apps.who.int/rhl/newborn/gpcom/en/index.html</ref>

==Alternatives to intervention==
Research has estimated that up to 95 percent of women can safely give birth without medical interventions (including, but not limited to, epidurals, caesarian sections, vacuum extraction, and forceps). Therefore, the midwifery model of care, which usually holds a more holistic approach to labor and delivery, tends to avoid such routine interventions (which can lead to complications for both mother and infant) when used for the sake of convenience, and rely on medical tools only when they are deemed absolutely necessary to ensure safety.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gaskin|first=Ina May|title=Ina May's Guide to Childbirth|year=2003|publisher=Bantam Dell, a Division of Random House|location=New York, New York|pages=184–203}}</ref>   

Instead of interventions, a variety of non-invasive methods are employed during natural childbirth to aid the mother, since they do not to carry the inherent risk of medical procedures.  Many of these stress the importance of "a mind-body connection," which the techno-medical model of birth tends to ignore. [[Pain management]] techniques other than medication include [[hydrotherapy]], [[massage]], [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]] therapy, [[hypnosis]], [[breath]]ing exercises, acupressure for labour, TENS, [[Speech production|vocalization]], [[Mental image|visualization]], [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] and [[water birth]]. Other approaches include movement and different positions (i.e. using a [[birthing ball]]), hot and cold therapy (i.e. using hot compresses and/or cold packs), and receiving one-on-one labor support like that provided by a [[midwife]] or [[doula]]. However, natural childbirth proponents maintain that pain is a natural and necessary part of the labor process, and should not automatically be regarded as entirely negative. In contrast to the pain of injury and disease, they believe that the pain of childbirth is a sign that the female body is functioning as it is meant to. 

Some methods used to augment labor without medication require that the woman is an active participant in the birthing process. They include frequently changing positions and walking. Birth positions favored in natural childbirth—including squatting, hands and knees, or suspension in water—contrast with the popular lithotomy position of a medicalized birth (woman in hospital bed on her back with legs in stirrups), which has consistently been shown to slow and complicate labor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis-Floyd|first=Robbie|title=Birth as an American Rite of Passage|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-22932-0}}</ref> Methods to reduce tearing (instead of an [[episiotomy]]) include managing the [[perineum]] with counter-pressure,<ref name=WHO>{{cite web |author = World Health Organization|year =1997 |title = Care in normal birth: A practical guide|url = http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/MSM_96_24/MSM_96_24_chapter4.en.html}}</ref> hot compresses, and pushing the baby out slowly.

==Preparation==
Some women take birth education classes (such as [[Lamaze]], the [[Bradley method of natural childbirth|Bradley Method]], CAPPA, ICEA, Hypnobabies.) to prepare for a natural childbirth. Several books are also available with information to help women prepare. A midwife or [[doula]] may include preparation for a natural birth as part of the prenatal care services. However, a  study published in 2009 suggests that preparation alone is not enough to ensure an intervention-free outcome.<ref>http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122394587/HTMLSTART?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0</ref>

==Prevalence of medical intervention in the U.S.==
A recent study revealed the rates of medical intervention in childbirth in the U.S. found that 93% of mothers used [[cardiotocography|electronic fetal monitoring]]; 63% used
[[epidural]]s; 55% had their [[rupture of membranes|membranes ruptured]]; 53% received [[oxytocin]] to stimulate labor progress; and 52% received [[episiotomy|episiotomies]].<ref name=Gissespie>{{cite web |coauthors = Gissespie, M., Strauss, M |year = 2007 |title = What Women Aren’t Told about Childbirth |url = http://www.alternet.org/story/65608}}</ref>
