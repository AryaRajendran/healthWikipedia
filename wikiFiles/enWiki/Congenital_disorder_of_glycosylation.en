A '''congenital disorder of glycosylation''' (previously called carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome) is one of several rare [[inborn errors of metabolism]] in which [[glycosylation]] of a variety of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[protein]]s and/or [[lipid]]s is deficient or defective. [[Congenital disorder]]s of glycosylation are sometimes known as CDG [[syndrome]]s. They often cause serious, sometimes fatal, malfunction of several different [[organ system]]s (especially the [[nervous system]], [[muscle]]s, and [[intestine]]s) in affected infants. The most common subtype is CDG-Ia (also referred to as PMM2-CDG) where the genetic defect leads to the loss of phosphomannomutase 2, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of [[mannose-6-phosphate]] into [[mannose-1-phosphate]].

==History==
The first CDG patients (twin sisters) were described in an abstract in the medical journal ''Pediatric Research'' in 1980 by Jaeken et al.<ref>Jaeken, J., Vanderschueren-Lodeweyckx, M., Casaer, P., Snoeck, L., Corbeel, L., Eggermont, E., and Eeckels, R. (1980) Pediatr Res 14, 179</ref> Their main features were [[psychomotor retardation]], [[Cerebral atrophy|cerebral]] and [[cerebellar atrophy]] and fluctuating [[hormone]] levels (''e.g.''prolactin, FSH and GH). During the next 15 years the underlying defect remained unknown but since the plasmaprotein transferrin was underglycosylated (as shown by ''e.g.'' ''isoelectric focusing''), the new syndrome was named carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome (CDGS).<ref>Jaeken, J., and Carchon, H. (1993) The carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndromes: an overview. J Inherit Metab Dis. 16, 813-20.</ref> Its "classical" [[phenotype]] included [[psychomotor retardation]], [[ataxia]], [[strabismus]], [[Congenital abnormality|anomalies]] (fat pads and inverted [[nipples]]) and [[coagulopathy]].

In 1994, a new phenotype was described and named CDGS-II.<ref>Jaeken, J., Schachter, H., Carchon, H., De Cock, P., Coddeville, B. and Spik, G. (1994) Arch. Dis. Childhood 71, 123-127</ref> In 1995, Van Schaftingen and Jaeken showed that CDGS-I (now CDG-Ia or PMM2-CDG) was caused by the deficiency of the enzyme [[phosphomannomutase]]. This enzyme is responsible for the interconversion of [[mannose-6-phosphate]] and [[mannose-1-phosphate]], and its deficiency leads to a shortage in [[GDP-mannose]] and [[dolichol]] (Dol)-[[mannose]] (Man), two donors required for the synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor of N-linked glycosylation.

In 1998, Niehues et al. published a new CDG syndrome, CDG-Ib, which is caused by [[mutation]]s in the enzyme metabolically upstream of PMM2, [[phosphomannose isomerase]] (PMI).<ref>Niehues, R., Hasilik, M., Alton, G., Körner, C., Schiebe-Sukumar, M., Koch, H.G., Zimmer, K.P., Wu, R., Harms, E., Reiter, K., von Figura, K., Freeze, H.H., Harms, H.K., Marquardt, T. Carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type Ib. Phosphomannose isomerase deficiency and [[mannose]] therapy. (1998) J. Clin. Invest. 101, 1414-20.</ref> In this paper, the authors also described a functional therapy for CDG-Ib, alimentary mannose.

The characterization of new defects took up speed and several new Type I and Type II defects were delineated.<ref>Haeuptle, M.A., and Hennet, T. Congenital disorders of glycosylation: an update on defects affecting the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. (2009) Hum Mutat 30, 1628-41.</ref>

==Classification==
Historically, CDGs are classified as Types I and II (CDG-I and CDG-II), depending on the nature and location of the biochemical defect in the [[metabolic pathway]] relative to the action of [[oligosaccharyltransferase]]. The most commonly used screening method for CDG, analysis of transferrin glycosylation status by [[isoelectric focusing]], [[ESI-MS]], or other techniques, distinguish between these subtypes in so called Type I and Type II patterns.

Currently, twenty-two CDG Type-I and fourteen Type-II subtypes of CDG have been described.<ref name="pmid22516080">{{cite journal | author = Freeze HH, Eklund EA, Ng BG, Patterson MC | title = Neurology of inherited glycosylation disorders | journal = Lancet Neurol. | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 453–66 | year = 2012 | month = May | pmid = 22516080 | doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(12)70040-6}}</ref>

Since 2009, most researchers use a different nomenclature based on the gene defect (''e.g.'' CDG-Ia = PMM2-CDG, CDG-Ib = PMI-CDG, CDG-Ic = ALG6-CDG etc.).<ref>Jaeken, J., Hennet, T., Matthijs, G., and Freeze, H.H. (2009) CDG nomenclature: time for a change! Biochim Biophys Acta. 1792, 825-6.</ref>  The reason for the new nomenclature was the fact that proteins not directly involved in glycan synthesis (such as members of the COG-family<ref>Wu, X., Steet, R.A., Bohorov, O., Bakker, J., Newell, J., Krieger, M., Spaapen, L., Kornfeld, S., and Freeze, H.H. Mutation of the COG complex subunit gene COG7 causes a lethal congenital disorder. (2004) Nat. Med. 10, 518-23.</ref> and vesicular H+-ATPase <ref>{{cite journal | author = Kornak U., Reynders E., Dimopoulou A., van Reeuwijk J., Fischer B., Rajab A., Budde B., Nürnberg P., -1#ARCL Debré-type Lefeber ''et al.'' | year = 2008 | title = Impaired glycosylation and cutis laxa caused by mutations in the vesicular H+-ATPase subunit ATP6V0A2 | url = | journal = Nat. Genet | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 32–4 }}</ref>) were found to be causing the glycosylation defect in some CDG patients. 

Also, defects disturbing other glycosylation pathways than the ''N''-linked one are included in this classification. Examples are the α-[[dystroglycanopathies]] (''e.g.'' POMT1/POMT2-CDG ([[Walker-Warburg syndrome]] and [[Muscle-Eye-Brain]] syndrome)) with deficiencies in ''O''-mannosylation of proteins; ''O''-xylosylglycan synthesis defects (EXT1/EXT2-CDG ([[hereditary multiple exostoses]]) and B4GALT7-CDG ([[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]], progeroid variant)); ''O''-fucosylglycan synthesis (B3GALTL-CDG (Peter’s plus syndrome) and LFNG-CDG ([[spondylocostal dysostosis]] III)).

==Presentation==
The specific problems produced differ according to the particular abnormal synthesis involved. Common manifestations include [[ataxia]]; [[seizure]]s; [[retinopathy]]; [[liver]] fibrosis; [[coagulopathy|coagulopathies]]; [[failure to thrive]]; [[dysmorphic feature]]s (''e.g.,'' [[inverted nipple]]s and [[subcutaneous]] [[fat pad]]s; and [[strabismus]].  If an MRI is obtained, cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia is a common finding.

Ocular abnormalities of CDG-Ia include: [[myopia]], [[infantile esotropia]], [[delayed visual maturation]], [[low vision]], [[optic pallor]], and reduced [[rod cell|rod]] function on [[electroretinography]].<ref name="pmid12789572">{{cite journal |author=Jensen H, Kjaergaard S, Klie F, Moller HU |title=Ophthalmic manifestations of congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1a |journal=Ophthalmic Genet. |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=81–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12789572|doi=10.1076/opge.24.2.81.13994}}</ref>

==''N''-Glycosylation and known defects==
A biologically very important group of [[carbohydrates]] is the [[asparagine]] ([[Asn]])-linked, or [[N-linked]], [[oligosaccharide]]s. Their [[biosynthetic pathway]] is very complex and involves a hundred or more [[glycosyltransferase]]s, [[glycosidase]]s, [[Membrane transport protein|transporters]] and [[synthase]]s. This plethora allows for the formation of a multitude of different final oligosaccharide structures, involved in [[protein folding]], [[intracellular]] transport/localization, protein activity, and degradation/half-life. A vast amount of carbohydrate binding molecules ([[lectins]]) depend on correct glycosylation for appropriate binding; the [[selectins]], involved in [[leukocyte]] extravasation, is a prime example. Their binding depends on a correct fucosylation of cell surface [[glycoprotein]]s. Lack thereof leads to leukocytosis and increase sensitivity to infections as seen in SLC35C1-CDG(CDG-IIc);  caused by a GDP-fucose (Fuc) transporter deficiency.

All N-linked oligosaccharides originate from a common lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor, synthesized in the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|ER]] on a dolichol-phosphate (Dol-P) anchor. The mature LLO is transferred co-translationally to consensus sequence [[Asn]] residues in the nascent protein, and is further modified by trimming and re-building in the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]].

Deficiencies in the [[genes]] involved in [[N-linked glycosylation]] constitute the molecular background to most of the CDGs.
* Type I defects involve the synthesis and transfer of the LLO
* Type II defects impair the modification process of protein-bound oligosaccharides.

| The formation of the LLO is initiated by the synthesis of the polyisoprenyl [[dolichol]] from [[farnesyl]], a [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of [[cholesterol]] biosynthesis. This step involves at least three genes, DHDDS (encoding [[dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase]] that is a ''cis''-prenyl transferase), DOLPP1 (a [[pyrophosphatase]]) and SRD5A3, encoding a [[reductase]] that completes the formation of [[dolichol]].
| Recently, exome sequencing showed that mutations in DHDDS cause a disorder with a retinal phenotype ([[retinitis pigmentosa]], a common finding in CDG patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Züchner S, Dallman J, Wen R, Beecham G, Naj A, Farooq A, Kohli MA, Whitehead PL, Hulme W ''et al.'' | year = 2011 | title = Whole-exome sequencing links a variant in DHDDS to retinitis pigmentosa | url = | journal = Am.

| The synthesis of [[GDP-Man]] is crucial for proper [[N-glycosylation]], as it serves as donor substrate for the formation of Dol-P-Man and the initial Man5GlcNAc2-P-Dol structure. GDP-Man synthesis is linked to glycolysis via the interconversion of [[fructose-6-P]] and [[Man-6-P]], catalyzed by [[phosphomannose isomerase]] (PMI).

| The final Dol-PP-bound 14mer oligosaccharides (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol) are transferred to consensus [[Asn]] residues in the acceptor proteins in the ER lumen, catalyzed by the [[oligosaccharyltransferase]](OST). The OST is composed by several subunits, including DDOST, TUSC3, MAGT1, KRTCAP2 and STT3a and -3b. 
| Three of these genes have hithero been shown to be mutated in CDG patients, DDOST (DDOST-CDG (CDG-Ir)), TUSC3 (TUSC3-CDG) and MAGT1 (MAGT1-CDG).

===Type II===
The mature LLO chain is next transferred to the growing protein chain, a process catalysed by the [[oligosaccharyl transferase]] (OST) complex.
* Once transferred to the protein chain, the oligosaccharide is trimmed by specific glycosidases. This process is vital since the [[lectin]] [[chaperone (protein)|chaperone]]s [[calnexin]] and [[calreticulin]], involved in protein quality, bind to the Glc1Man9GlcNAc-structure and assure proper folding. Lack of the first glycosidase ([[GCS1]]) causes CDG-IIb.
* Removal of the Glc residues and the first Man residue occurs in the ER.
* The glycoprotein then travels to the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]], where a multitude of different structures with different biological activities are formed.
* [[Mannosidase]] I creates a Man5GlcNAc2-structure on the protein, but note that this has a different structure than the one made on LLO.
* Next, a GlcNAc residue forms GlcNAc1Man5GlcNAc2, the substrate for a-mannosidase II (aManII).
* aManII then removes two Man residues, creating the substrate for GlcNAc transferase II, which adds a GlcNAc to the second Man branch. This structure serves as substrate for additional [[galactosylation]], [[fucosylation]] and [[sialylation]] reactions. Additionally, substitution with more GlcNAc residues can yield tri- and tetra-antennary molecules.

Not all structures are fully modified, some remain as high-mannose structures, others as hybrids (one unmodified Man branch and one modified), but the majority become fully modified complex type oligosaccharides.

In addition to glycosidase I, mutations have been found:
* in [[MGAT2]], in GlcNAc transferase II (CDG-IIa)
* in [[SLC35C1]], the GDP-Fuc transporter (CDG-IIc)
* in [[B4GALT1]], a [[galactosyltransferase]] (CDG-IId)
* in [[COG7]], the conserved oligomeric Golgi complex-7 (CDG-IIe)
* in [[SLC35A1]], the CMP-sialic acid (NeuAc) transporter (CDG-IIf)

However, the use of >100 genes in this process, presumably means that many more defects are to be found.

==Treatment==
No treatment is available for most of these disorders. [[Mannose]] supplementation relieves the symptoms in PMI-CDG (CDG-Ib) for the most part,<ref>Mention, K., Lacaille, F., Valayannopoulos, V., Romano, S., Kuster, A., Cretz, M., Zaidan, H., Galmiche, L., Jaubert, F., de Keyzer, Y., Seta, N., and de Lonlay, P.
