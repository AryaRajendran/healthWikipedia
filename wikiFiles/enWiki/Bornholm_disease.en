'''Bornholm disease''' or '''epidemic pleurodynia''' or '''epidemic myalgia'''<ref name="pmid15420445">{{cite journal |author=HOPKINS JH |title=Bornholm disease |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue=4664 |pages=1230–2 |year=1950 |month=May |pmid=15420445 |pmc=2038054 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.4664.1230|url=}}</ref> is a [[disease]] caused by the [[Coxsackie B virus]] or other viruses.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000083496|epidemic pleurodynia}}</ref>

It is named after the [[Denmark|Danish]] island [[Bornholm]] where early cases occurred.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms may include fever and headache, but the distinguishing characteristic of this disease is attacks of severe pain in the lower chest, often on one side.<ref name="pmid13042253">{{cite journal |author=WARIN JF, DAVIES JB, SANDERS FK, VIZOSO AD |title=Oxford epidemic of Bornholm disease, 1951 |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue=4824 |pages=1345–51 |year=1953 |month=June |pmid=13042253 |pmc=2016648 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.4824.1345|url=}}</ref> The slightest movement of the rib cage causes a sharp increase of pain, which makes it very difficult to breathe, and an attack is therefore quite a frightening experience, although it generally passes off before any actual harm occurs. The attacks are unpredictable and strike "out of the blue" with a feeling like an iron grip around the rib cage. The colloquial names for the disease, such as 'The Devil's grip' (see also "other names" below) reflect this symptom.

==Cause==
Inoculation of [[throat washings]] taken from people with [[pleurodynia]] into the brains of newborn mice revealed that [[enterovirus]]es in the [[Coxsackie B virus]] group were likely to be the cause of pleurodynia,<ref name="pmid14774516">{{cite journal |author=WELLER TH, ENDERS JF, BUCKINGHAM M, FINN JJ |title=The [[etiology]] of epidemic [[pleurodynia]]: a study of two [[virus]]es isolated from a typical outbreak |journal=J.

==Epidemiology==
[[Coxsackie B virus]] is spread by contact and epidemics usually occur during warm weather in temperate regions and at any time in the tropics. As is typical with this virus family, it is shed in large amounts in the feces of infected persons.<ref name="pmid1179480">{{cite journal |author=Chong AY, Lee LH, Wong HB |title=Epidemic pleurodynia (Bornholm disease) outbreak in Singapore.

==Treatment and prognosis==
The illness lasts about a week and is rarely fatal. Treatment includes the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or the application of heat to the affected muscles.  Relapses during the weeks following the initial episode are a characteristic feature of this disease.<ref name="pmid5341038">{{cite journal |author=Vogelsang TM |title=The occurrence of Bamble Disease (epidemic pleurodynia) in Norway |journal=Med Hist |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=86–90 |year=1967 |month=January |pmid=5341038 |pmc=1033670 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==History==
In 1872, [[Daae-Finsen]] reported an epidemic of "acute muscular rheumatism" occurring in a community called Bamble, giving rise to the name "Bamble disease" in Norway.  Subsequent reports, published only in Norwegian, referred to the disease by this name.  In 1933, [[Ejnar Sylvest]] gave a doctoral thesis describing a Danish outbreak of this disease on Bornholm Island entitled, "Bornholm disease-myalgia epidemica", and this name has persisted.<ref name="pmid5341038"/>

==Other names==
It is also known as ''Bamble disease'',<ref name="pmid5341038"/> the ''devil's grip'', ''devil's grippe'', ''epidemic myalgia'', ''epidemic pleurodynia'', ''epidemic transient diaphragmatic spasm'' or ''The Grasp of the Phantom''.
