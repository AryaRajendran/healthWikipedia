'''Presbycusis''' (also spelt '''presbyacusis''', from Greek ''presbys'' “elder” + ''akousis'' “hearing”<ref>''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=presbycousis Presbycousis]</ref>), or '''age-related [[hearing loss]]''', is the cumulative effect of aging on [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. It is a progressive bilateral symmetrical age-related [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. The hearing loss is most marked at higher frequencies. Hearing loss that accumulates with age but is caused by factors other than normal aging is not presbycusis, although differentiating the individual effects of multiple causes of hearing loss can be difficult.

==Presentation==
Deterioration in hearing has been found to start very early, from about the age of 18 years. The [[List of ISO standards|ISO standard]] 7029 shows expected threshold changes due purely to age for carefully screened populations (i.e. excluding those with ear disease, noise exposure etc.), based on a meta-analysis of published data.<ref>D.W. Robinson and G.J. Sutton "Age effect in hearing -- a comparative analysis of published threshold data." Audiology 1979; 18(4): YOLO  320-334 [http://www.isa-audiology.org/periodicals/1971-2001_Audiology/1979,%20%20Audiology,%20%20Vol.%20%2018/No.%204%20%20%28265-352%29/Robinson%20Sutton,%20%20Audiology,%20%201979.pdf]</ref><ref>E. Van Eyken, G. Van Camp, L. Van Laer, "The Complexity of Age-Related Hearing Impairment: Contributing Environmental and Genetic Factors", Audiol Neurotol 2007;12:345-358 [http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=pdf&file=000106478]</ref> Age affects high frequencies more than low, and men more frequently than women. One early consequence is that even young adults may lose the ability to hear very high frequency tones above 15 or 16&nbsp;kHz. Despite this, age-related hearing loss may only become noticeable later in life. The effects of age can be exacerbated by [[noise health effects|exposure to environmental noise]], whether at work or in leisure time (shooting, music, etc.). This is [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) and is distinct from presbycusis.  

Over time, the detection of high-pitched sounds becomes more difficult, and speech perception is affected, particularly of [[sibilant]]s and [[fricative]]s. Both ears tend to be affected.

===Pathophysiology===
Examples of microscopic changes seen in this condition are hair cell degeneration of the [[cochlea]] and giant [[stereocilia (inner ear)|stereocilia]]ry degeneration.

{{Main|Hearing loss#Causes}}
Factors that can cause hearing loss, which can be difficult to distinguish or separate from presbycusis, include:
* [[Heredity]]: Features like early aging of the cochlea and susceptibility of the cochlea for drug insults are genetically determined.
* [[Atherosclerosis]]: May diminish vascularity of the cochlea, thereby reducing its oxygen supply.
* [[Dietary habits]]: Increased intake of [[saturated fat]] may accelerate atherosclerotic changes in old age.
* [[Diabetes]]: May cause vasculitis and endothelial proliferation in the blood vessels of the cochlea, thereby reducing its blood supply.
* [[Noise-induced hearing loss|Noise trauma]]: Exposure  to [[Noise pollution|loud noise]]/[[Loud music|music]] on a continuing basis stresses the already hypoxic cochlea, hastening the presbycusis.
* [[Smoking]]: Is postulated to accentuate atherosclerotic changes in blood vessels aggravating presbycusis.
* [[Hypertension]]: Causes potent vascular changes, like reduction in blood supply to the cochlea, thereby aggravating presbycusis.
* [[Ototoxicity|Ototoxic drugs]]: Ingestion of ototoxic drugs like [[aspirin]] may hasten the process of presbycusis.

== Cultural aspects ==

Recently, the ability of young people to hear high frequency tones that are inaudible to others over 25 or so has led to the development of technologies to disperse groups of [[yobbo]]es around nearby British shops ([[The Mosquito]]), and the development of a cell phone ringtone, [[Teen Buzz]], for students to use in school, that many older instructors are unable to hear. In September 2006 this technique was used to make a dance track called 'Buzzin'.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/5382324.stm</ref> The track had two melodies, one that everyone could hear and one that only younger people could hear.
