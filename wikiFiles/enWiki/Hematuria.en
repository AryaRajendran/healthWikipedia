In [[medicine]], '''hematuria''', or '''haematuria''', is the presence of [[red blood cells]] (erythrocytes) in the [[urine]]. It may be [[idiopathic]] and/or [[Benignity|benign]], or it can be a sign that there is a [[kidney stone]] or a [[tumor]] in the [[urinary tract]] ([[kidney]]s, [[ureter]]s, [[urinary bladder]], [[prostate]], and [[urethra]]), ranging from trivial to lethal. If [[white blood cells]] are found in addition to red blood cells, then it is a signal of urinary tract infection.

Occasionally "[[hemoglobinuria]]" is used synonymously, although more precisely it refers only to [[hemoglobin]] in the urine.

== Types ==
Red discoloration of the urine can have various causes:
* [[Red blood cell]]s
** [[Microscopic hematuria]] (small amounts of blood, can be seen only on [[urinalysis]] or [[light microscopy]])
** Macroscopic hematuria (or "frank" or "gross") hematuria
* [[Hemoglobin]] (only the red pigment, not the [[red blood cell]]s)
* Other pigments
** [[Myoglobin]] in [[myoglobinuria]]
** [[Porphyrin]]s in [[porphyria]]
** [[Betanin]], after eating [[beet]]s
** Drugs such as [[Rifampicin]] and [[Phenazopyridine]]

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:HematuriaTrauma.JPG|thumb|Acute hematuria due to trauma.]]
Often, the diagnosis is made on the basis of the medical history and some [[blood test]]s—especially in young people in whom the risk of malignancy is negligible and the symptoms are generally self-limiting.

[[Ultrasound]] investigation of the renal tract is often used to distinguish between various sources of bleeding. [[X-ray]]s can be used to identify [[kidney stone]]s, although [[computed axial tomography|CT scanning]] is more precise.

In older patients, [[cystoscopy]] with [[biopsy]] of suspected lesions is often employed to investigate for [[bladder cancer]].

If combined with pain, it may be ''loin pain hematuria syndrome''.<ref name="Spetie-2006">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Spetie | first1 = DN. | last2 = Nadasdy | first2 = T. | last3 = Nadasdy | first3 = G. | last4 = Agarwal | first4 = G. | last5 = Mauer | first5 = M. | last6 = Agarwal | first6 = AK. | last7 = Khabiri | first7 = H. | last8 = Nagaraja | first8 = HN. | last9 = Nahman | first9 = NS. | title = Proposed pathogenesis of idiopathic loin pain-hematuria syndrome. | journal = Am J Kidney Dis | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–27 | month = Mar | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1053/j.ajkd.2005.11.029 | pmid = 16490620 | last = Hebert | first = LA. }}</ref>

== Causes ==

The most common causes of hematuria<ref name=urologychannel/> are:
* [[Urinary tract infection]] with viruses,<ref name=urologychannel/> other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (particularly in women)<ref name=urologychannel/> or some bacterial species including strains of [[Escherichia coli#Urinary tract infection|EPEC]] and [[Staphylococcus saprophyticus]]

* [[Bladder stones]]
* [[Kidney stones]] or [[ureter stones]]
* [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia]], in older men, especially those over 50

Other, less common causes of hematuria include:
* [[IgA nephropathy]] ("Berger's disease") - occurs during viral infections in predisposed patients
* Trauma (e.g., a blow to the kidneys)
* Tumors and/or cancer in the urinary system,<ref name=urologychannel/> for example [[bladder cancer]] or [[renal cell carcinoma]]
* Kidney diseases<ref name=urologychannel/>
* Urinary [[Schistosomiasis]] (caused by ''[[Schistosoma haematobium]]'') - a major cause for hematuria in many African and Middle-Eastern countries;
*Prostate infection or inflammation ([[prostatitis]])<ref name=urologychannel/>

Rare causes include:
* [[Thin basement membrane disease|Benign familial hematuria]]
* [[Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]] - a [[rare disease]] where [[hemoglobin]] of [[hemolysis|hemolyzed]] cells is passed into the urine
* [[Sickle cell trait]] can precipitate large amounts of red blood cell discharge, but only a small number of individuals endure this problem
* [[Arteriovenous malformation]] of the kidney (rare, but may impress like renal cell carcinoma on scans as both are highly vascular)
* [[Nephritic syndrome]] (a condition associated with post-streptococcal and rapidly progressing [[glomerulonephritis]])
*[[Fibrinoid necrosis]] of the Glomeruli (as a result of malignant hypertension)
*[[Vesical varices]] may rarely develop secondary to obstruction of the [[inferior vena cava]]<ref name="Koshy-2009">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Koshy | first1 = CG. | last2 = Govil | first2 = S. | last3 = Shyamkumar | first3 = NK. | last4 = Devasia | first4 = A. | title = Bladder varices--rare cause of painless hematuria in idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. | journal = Urology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–9 | month = Jan | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2008.06.039 | pmid = 18722652 }}</ref>

* Left [[renal vein]] [[hypertension]], also called [[Nutcracker_phenomenon|"nutcracker phenomenon"]] or "nutcracker syndrome," is a rare vascular abnormality responsible for gross hematuria <ref name="Russo-1998">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Russo | first1 = D. | last2 = Minutolo | first2 = R. | last3 = Iaccarino | first3 = V. | last4 = Andreucci | first4 = M. | last5 = Capuano | first5 = A. | last6 = Savino | first6 = FA. | title = Gross hematuria of uncommon origin: the nutcracker syndrome. | journal = Am J Kidney Dis | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = E3 | month = Sep | year = 1998 | doi =  | pmid = 10074588 }}</ref>
* Ureteral Pelvic Junction Obstruction (UPJ) is a rare condition beginning from birth in which the ureter is blocked between the kidney and bladder. This condition may cause blood in the urine <ref>[http://www.emoryhealthcare.org/departments/urology/sub_menu/upj.html <STRONG>Ureteral Pelvic Junction Obstruction (UPJ) / Ureteral Obstruction</STRONG><!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* [[March hematuria]] secondary to repetitive impacts on the body, usually the feet
* [[Athletic nephritis]] secondary to strenuous exercise
* Medications can cause red discoloration of the urine, but not hematuria. Some examples include: [[sulfonamides]], [[quinine]], [[rifampin]], [[phenytoin]]<ref name=urologychannel>[http://www.urologychannel.com/hematuria/causes.shtml Hematuria Causes] Original Date of Publication: 15 Jun 1998.
