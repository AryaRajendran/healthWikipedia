'''Leydig cell tumour''', also '''Leydig cell tumor''' (US spelling), '''(testicular) interstitial cell tumour''' and '''(testicular) interstitial cell tumor''' (US spelling), is a member of the [[sex cord-stromal tumour]] group<ref name="pmid18382911">{{cite journal |author=Sachdeva P, Arora R, Dubey C, Sukhija A, Daga M, Singh DK |title=Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor: a rare ovarian neoplasm.

It arises from [[Leydig cell]]s. While the tumour can occur at any age, it occurs most often in young adults.

A [[Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour]] is a combination of a Leydig cell tumour and a [[Sertoli cell tumour]] from [[Sertoli cell]]s.

==Presentation==
The majority of Leydig cell tumors are found in men, usually at 5–10 years of age or in middle adulthood (30–60 years).  Children typically present with precocious puberty.  Due to excess [[testosterone]] secreted by the tumour, one-third of '''female''' patients present with a recent history of progressive [[masculinization]].  Masculinization is preceded by [[anovulation]], [[oligomenorrhea]], [[amenorrhea]] and ''[[defeminization]]''.  Additional signs include [[acne vulgaris|acne]] and [[hirsutism]], voice deepening, [[clitoromegaly]], temporal hair recession, and an increase in musculature.  Serum testosterone level is high.

==Diagnosis==
Presence of an ovarian tumour plus hormonal disturbances suggests a Leydig cell tumour, [[granulosa cell tumour]] or [[thecoma]].  However, hormonal disturbances, in Leydig tumours, is present in only 2/3 of cases.  A conclusive diagnosis is made via [[histology]], as part of a pathology report made during or after surgery.  See also [[Sex cord-stromal tumour]].

Immunohistochemical markers of Leydig cell tumours include [[inhibin-alpha]], [[calretinin]], and [[melan-A]].<ref name="pmid12409718">{{cite journal |author=Ulbright TM, Srigley JR, Hatzianastassiou DK, Young RH |title=Leydig cell tumors of the testis with unusual features: adipose differentiation, calcification with ossification, and spindle-shaped tumor cells |journal=Am.

==Treatment==
The usual treatment is surgery.  The surgery usually is a fertility-sparing unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.  For malignant tumours, the surgery may be radical and usually is followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, sometimes by radiation therapy.  In all cases, initial treatment is followed by surveillance.  Because in many cases Leydig cell tumour does not produce elevated [[tumor marker|tumour marker]]s,<ref name="pmid17484630">{{cite journal
