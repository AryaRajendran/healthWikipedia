A-scan is an amplitude modulation scan. It gives the information in the form of one dimensional. it is used to detect the presence of flaws in the materials.
'''A-scan ultrasound biometry''', commonly referred to as an '''A-scan''', is routine type of diagnostic test used in [[ophthalmology]].  The A-scan provides data on the length of the [[human eye|eye]], which is a major determinant in [[list of eye diseases and disorders|common sight disorders]].  The most common use of the A-scan is to determine eye length for calculation of intraocular lens power.  Briefly, the total refractive power of the emmetropic eye is approximately 60.  Of this power, the cornea provides roughly 40 diopters, and the crystalline lens 20 diopters.  When a cataract is removed, the lens is replaced by an artificial lens implant.  By measuring both the length of the eye (A-scan) and the power of the cornea (keratometry), a simple formula can be used to calculate the power of the intraocular lens needed.  There are several different formulas that can be used depending on the actual characteristics of the eye.

The other major use of the A-scan is to determine the size and ultrasound characteristics of masses in the eye, in order to determine the type of mass.  This is often termed quantitative A-scan.

Instruments used in this type of test require direct contact with the [[cornea]], however a non-contact instrument has been reported. Disposable covers, which come in actual contact with the eye, have also been evaluated.

As generally applied to pulse echo ultrasonics, the horizontal and vertical sweeps are proportional to time or distance and amplitude or magnitude respectively. Thus the location and magnitude of acoustical interface are indicated as to depth below the transducer. The term comes from radar technology in World War II, in which it provided the same type of display.
