{{Cranial nerves short}}

The '''oculomotor nerve''' is the 3rd of 12 paired [[cranial nerves]]. It enters the orbit via the [[superior orbital fissure]] and controls most of the eye's movements, including constriction of the pupil and maintaining an open eyelid by innervating the [[levator palpebrae superioris muscle]]. The oculomotor nerve is derived from the [[Basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]] of the [[embryo]]nic [[midbrain]]. Cranial nerves [[trochlear nerve|IV]] and [[abducens|VI]] also participate in control of [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]].

==Path==
===Nuclei===
The oculomotor nerve (CN III) arises from the anterior aspect of [[mesencephalon]] (midbrain). There are two nuclei for the oculomotor nerve:

* The [[oculomotor nucleus]] originates at the level of the [[superior colliculus]]. The muscles it controls are the striated muscle in levator palpebrae superioris and all [[extraocular muscles]] except for the [[superior oblique muscle]] and the [[lateral rectus muscle]]. 

* The [[Edinger-Westphal nucleus]] supplies [[parasympathetic]] fibres to the eye via the [[ciliary ganglion]], and thus controls the [[sphincter pupillae]] muscle (effecting [[pupil constriction]]) and the [[ciliary muscle]] (affecting [[Accommodation reflex|accommodation]]).

Sympathetic postganglionic fibres also join the nerve from the plexus on the internal carotid artery in the wall of the cavernous sinus and are distributed through the nerve, e.g., to the smooth muscle of superior tarsal (Mueller's) muscle.

===Emergence from brain===
On emerging from the brain, the nerve is invested with a sheath of [[pia mater]], and enclosed in a prolongation from the [[arachnoid mater|arachnoid]]. 

It passes between the [[superior cerebellar]] (below) and [[posterior cerebral]] arteries (above), and then pierces the dura mater anterior and lateral to the [[posterior clinoid process]], passing between the free and attached borders of the [[tentorium cerebelli]]. 

It runs along the lateral wall of the [[cavernous sinus]], above the other [[orbital nerve]]s, receiving in its course one or two filaments from the [[cavernous plexus]] of the sympathetic, and a communicating branch from the [[ophthalmic division]] of the [[trigeminal]].

===Superior and inferior rami===
It then divides into two branches, which enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure, between the two heads of the [[lateral rectus]]. 

Here the nerve is placed below the [[trochlear nerve]] and the frontal and lacrimal branches of the ophthalmic nerve, while the [[nasociliary nerve]] is placed between its two rami:

* [[superior branch of oculomotor nerve]]
* [[inferior branch of oculomotor nerve]]

==Testing==
===Eye muscles===
Cranial nerves III, IV, and VI are usually tested together. The examiner typically instructs the patient to hold his head still and follow only with the eyes a finger or penlight that circumscribes a large "H" in front of the patient. By observing the [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]] and [[eyelid]]s, the examiner is able to obtain more information about the [[extraocular muscles]], the [[levator palpebrae superioris muscle]], and cranial nerves III, IV, and VI.

Since the oculomotor nerve controls most of the eye muscles, it may be easier to detect damage to it.  Damage to this nerve, termed [[oculomotor nerve palsy]] is also known by the ''down 'n out'' symptoms, because of the position of the affected eye (lateral, downward deviation of gaze).

===Pupillary reflex===
The oculomotor nerve also controls the constriction of the [[pupil]]s and thickening of the lens of the eye. This can be tested in two main ways. By moving a finger toward a person's face to induce [[accommodation reflex|accommodation]], as well as his going cross-eyed, his pupils should constrict.

Shining a light into one eye should result in equal constriction of the other eye. The neurons in the optic nerve decussate in the optic chiasm with some crossing to the contralateral optic nerve tract. This is the basis of the "[[swinging-flashlight test]]".

Loss of [[accommodation reflex|accommodation]] and continued pupillary dilation can indicate the presence of a lesion on the oculumotor nerve.

==Pathology==
Paralysis of the oculomotor nerve, i.e., [[oculomotor nerve palsy]], can arise due to:
*direct [[Physical trauma|trauma]],
*demyelinating diseases (e.g., [[multiple sclerosis]]),
*increased intracranial pressure (leading to [[uncal herniation]])
**due to a space-occupying lesion (e.g., [[brain cancer]]) or a
**spontaneous [[subarachnoid haemorrhage]] (e.g., [[berry aneurysm]]), and
*microvascular disease, e.g., diabetes.

In people with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and older than 50 years of age, an oculomotor nerve palsy, in the classical sense, occurs with sparing (or preservation) of the pupillary reflex.  This is thought to arise due the anatomical arrangement of the [[nerve fiber]]s in the oculomotor nerve; fibers controlling the pupillary function are superficial and spared from [[ischemia|ischemic]] injuries typical of diabetes.  On the converse, an aneurysm which leads to compression of the oculomotor nerve affects the superficial fibers and manifests as a third nerve palsy with loss of the pupillary reflex (in fact, this third nerve finding is considered to represent an aneurysm--until proven otherwise--and should be investigated).<ref>Goodwin J.
