The '''Bowman's capsule''' (or '''capsula glomeruli''', '''glomerular capsule''') is a cup-like sac at the beginning of the tubular component of a [[nephron]] in the mammalian [[kidney]] that performs the first step in the filtration of blood to form urine. A [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus]] is enclosed in the sac. Fluids from blood in the glomerulus are collected in the Bowman's capsule (i.e., [[glomerular filtrate]]) and further processed along the nephron to form [[urine]]. This process is known as [[Ultrafiltration (renal)|ultrafiltration]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The Bowman's capsule is named after [[Sir William Bowman, 1st Baronet|Sir William Bowman]], who identified it in 1842.

==Anatomy==
Outside the capsule, there are two "poles":
* The [[vascular pole]] is the side with the [[afferent arteriole]] and [[efferent arteriole]].
* the [[urinary pole]] is the side with the [[proximal convoluted tubule]].

Inside the capsule, the layers are as follows, from outside to inside:{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
*''Parietal layer'' -- A single layer of [[simple squamous epithelium]]. Does not function in filtration.
*''Bowman's space (or "urinary space", or "capsular space")'' -- Between the visceral and parietal layers, into which the filtrate enters after passing through the [[filtration slits]].<ref>{{BUHistology|22401lba}}</ref>
*''Visceral layer'' -- Lies just above the thickened [[glomerular basement membrane]] and is made of [[podocyte]]s. Beneath the visceral layer lie the [[glomerular capillaries]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
*''Filtration barrier'' --  The filtration barrier is composed of the fenestrated endothelium of the glomerular capillaries, the fused basal lamina of the endothelial cells and podocytes, and the filtration slits of the podocytes.  The barrier permits the passage of water, ions, and small molecules from the bloodstream into the Bowman's space.  The barrier prevents the passage of large and/or negatively charged proteins (such as albumin).  The basal lamina of the filtration barrier is composed of three layers.  The first layer is the lamina rara externa, adjacent to the podocyte processes.  The second layer is the lamina rara interna, adjacent to the endothelial cells.  The final layer is the lamina densa which is a darker central zone of the basal lamina.  It consists of the meshwork of type IV collagen and laminin which act as a selective macromolecular filter.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Physiology==
The process of filtration of the blood in the Bowman's capsule is [[Ultrafiltration (renal)|ultrafiltration]] (or glomerular filtration), and the normal rate of filtration is 125 ml/min, equivalent to 80 times the daily blood volume.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Any proteins under roughly 30 [[dalton (unit)|kilodaltons]] can pass freely through the membrane, although there is some extra hindrance for negatively charged molecules due to the negative charge of the basement membrane and the podocytes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Any small molecules such as [[water]], [[glucose]], [[salt]] (NaCl), [[amino acid]]s, and [[urea]] pass freely into Bowman's space, but [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[platelets]] and large [[proteins]] do not.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

As a result, the filtrate leaving the Bowman's capsule is very similar to [[blood plasma]] in composition as it passes into the [[proximal convoluted tubule]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Clinical significance==
Measuring the [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR) is a [[Renal physiology#Tests|diagnostic test of kidney function]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

I decreased GFR may be a sign of [[renal failure]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

A number of diseases can result in various problems within the glomerulus.  Examples include acute proliferative (endocapillary) glomerulonephritis, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, mesangiocapillary (membranoproliferative) glomerulonephritis, acute crescentic glomerulonephritis, focal segmental glomerulonephritis, and diabetic glomerulosclerosis.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Eponym==
Bowman's capsule is named after [[Sir William Bowman]] (1816-1892), a British [[surgery|surgeon]] and [[anatomist]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Together with the glomerulus it is known as a [[renal corpuscle]], or a Malpighian corpuscle, [[eponym|named after]] [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628-1694), an Italian [[physician]] and [[biologist]]. This name is not used widely anymore, probably to avoid confusion with [[Splenic lymphoid nodules|Malpighian bodies of the spleen]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
