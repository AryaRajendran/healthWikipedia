The inclusion bodies of Chlamydia trachomatis were first described in 1942, the Chlamydia trachomatis agent was first cultured in the yolk sacs of eggs by Professor Feifan Tang et al in 1957.<ref>S Darougar, B R Jones, J R Kimptin, J D Vaughan-Jackson, and E M Dunlop.

''C. trachomatis'' includes three human [[biovar]]s:
*[[serovar]]s Ab, B, Ba, or C - cause [[trachoma]]: infection of the eyes which can lead to blindness and is prevalent in Africa
*serovars D-K - cause [[urethritis]], [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], neonatal [[pneumonia]], and neonatal [[conjunctivitis]]
*serovars L1, L2 and L3 - [[lymphogranuloma venereum]] (LGV).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fredlund H, Falk L, Jurstrand M, Unemo M |title=Molecular genetic methods for diagnosis and characterisation of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae: impact on epidemiological surveillance and interventions |journal=APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica |volume=112 |issue=11–12 |pages=771–84 |year=2004 |pmid=15638837 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0463.2004.apm11211-1205.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0903-4641&date=2004&volume=112&issue=11-12&spage=771}}</ref>

Many, but not all, ''C. trachomatis'' strains have an extrachromosomal [[plasmid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carlson JH, Whitmire WM, Crane DD, ''et al.'' |title=The Chlamydia trachomatis Plasmid Is a Transcriptional Regulator of Chromosomal Genes and a Virulence Factor |journal=Infection and immunity |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=2273–83 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18347045 |pmc=2423098 |doi=10.1128/IAI.00102-08 |url=http://iai.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18347045}}</ref>

In a study released on March 12, 2012 in Nature Genetics, researchers have found that Chlamydia has evolved more actively than was previously thought. Using whole genome sequencing the researchers show that the exchange of DNA between different strains of Chlamydia to form new strains is much more common than expected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.totheunknown.com/?p=309 |title=Whole genome analysis of Chlamydia trachomatis highlights risks with current method of tracking |author= Nature Genetics | date=2012-03-12 | accessdate=2012-03-12}}</ref>

==Identification==

''Chlamydia'' species are readily identified and distinguished from other chlamydial species using DNA-based tests.

Most strains of ''C. trachomatis'' are recognized by [[monoclonal antibodies]] (mAbs) to epitopes in the VS4 region of  MOMP.<ref name="pmid10678996">{{cite journal |author=Ortiz L, Angevine M, Kim SK, Watkins D, DeMars R |title=T-Cell Epitopes in Variable Segments of Chlamydia trachomatis Major Outer Membrane Protein Elicit Serovar-Specific Immune Responses in Infected Humans |journal=Infect.

==Clinical significance==
{{See also|Chlamydia infection}}

''C. trachomatis'' is an obligate intracellular pathogen (i.e. the bacterium lives within human cells) and can cause numerous disease states in both men and women.<ref name=Sherris /> Both sexes can display [[urethritis]], [[proctitis]] (rectal disease and bleeding), [[trachoma]], and  [[infertility]]. The bacterium can cause [[prostatitis]] and [[epididymitis]] in men. In women, [[cervicitis]],  [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID), [[ectopic pregnancy]], and acute or chronic pelvic pain are frequent complications. 

''C. trachomatis'' is also an important [[neonatal]] pathogen, where it can lead to infections of the eye ([[trachoma]]) and pulmonary complications.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21769086</ref> Chlamydia trachomatis is the single most important infectious agent associated with blindness; approximately 600 million worldwide suffer C. trachomatis eye infections and 20 million are blinded as a result of the infection.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Treatment===
''C. trachomatis'' may be treated with any of several bacteriostatic [[antibiotic]]s: [[macrolides]] ([[azithromycin]], [[clarithromycin]], [[erythromycin]], etc) or [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracyclines]] ([[doxycycline]], [[tetracycline]], etc).<ref>[http://www.thesticlinic.com/Chlamydia.aspx Chlamydia Information]</ref>

*Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). These tests find the genetic material (DNA) of chlamydia bacteria. These tests are the most sensitive tests available. That means they are very accurate and that they are very unlikely to have false-negative test results. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is an example of a nucleic acid amplification test. This test can also be done on a urine sample.
*Nucleic acid hybridization tests (DNA probe test). A probe test also finds chlamydia DNA. A probe test is very accurate but is not as sensitive as nucleic acid amplification tests.
*Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, EIA). This quick test finds substances (chlamydia antigens) that trigger the immune system to fight chlamydia infection.
*Direct fluorescent antibody test (DFA). This quick test also finds chlamydia antigens.
*Chlamydia culture. A culture is a special cup that allows the chlamydia bacteria to grow. This test is more expensive, and the results take longer (5 to 7 days) than the other tests. The culture must be done in a lab.
