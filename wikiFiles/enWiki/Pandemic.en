A '''pandemic''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] πᾶν ''pan'' "all" + δῆμος ''demos'' "people") is an [[epidemic]] of [[infectious disease]] that has spread through human populations across a large region; for instance multiple [[continents]], or even worldwide. A widespread [[endemic]] disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic. Further, [[Influenza pandemic|flu pandemics]] generally exclude recurrences of [[seasonal flu]]. Throughout history there have been a number of pandemics, such as [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]].  More recent pandemics include the [[HIV]] pandemic and the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]] pandemics of [[1918 flu pandemic|1918]] and [[2009 flu pandemic|2009]].

== Definition and stages ==
A pandemic can be defined as "An epidemic occurring worldwide or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries, and usually affecting a large number of people."<ref name=Porta2008>{{cite book|author=Miquel Porta|editor=Miquel Porta|title=Dictionary of Epidemiology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3Dr8dyuzvTkC&pg=PA179|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=3 July 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531449-6|page=179}}</ref>

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ Current WHO phase of pandemic alert] ''World Health Organization'' 2009</ref>

A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people;it must also be infectious. For instance, [[cancer]] is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious.

In a virtual press conference in May 2009 on the influenza pandemic Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General ad Interim for Health Security and Environment, WHO said "An easy way to think about pandemic ... is to say: a pandemic is a global outbreak. Then you might ask yourself: “What is a global outbreak”? Global outbreak means that we see both spread of the agent ... and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/influenzaAH1N1_presstranscript_20090526.pdf |title=WHO press conference on 2009 pandemic influenza |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref>

In planning for a possible influenza pandemic the WHO published a document on pandemic preparedness guidance in 1999, revised in 2005 and in February 2009, defining phases and appropriate actions for each phase in an aide memoir entitled ''WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase''.  The 2009 revision, including definitions of a pandemic and the phases leading to its declaration, were finalized in February 2009. The pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, was neither on the horizon at that time nor mentioned in the document <ref>{{cite web|last=WHO|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|title=Pandemic influenza preparedness and response|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> All versions of this document refer to influenza.

== Pandemics and notable epidemics through history ==
{{See also|List of epidemics|Columbian Exchange|Globalization and disease}}

There have been a number of significant pandemics recorded in human [[history]], generally [[zoonosis|zoonoses]] which came about with [[domestication]] of animals, such as [[influenza]] and tuberculosis. There have been a number of particularly significant [[epidemic]]s that deserve mention above the "mere" destruction of cities:

* [[Plague of Athens]], 430 BC. [[Typhoid fever]] killed a quarter of the Athenian troops, and a quarter of the population over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of [[Athens]], but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years. In January 2006, researchers from the [[University of Athens]] analyzed [[teeth]] recovered from a [[mass grave]] underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of [[bacteria]] responsible for typhoid.<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000BF619-9B78-13D6-9B7883414B7F0135&ref=sciam&chanID=sa003 "Ancient Athenian Plague Proves to Be Typhoid"].

* [[Antonine Plague]], 165–180. Possibly smallpox brought to the Italian peninsula by soldiers returning from the Near East; it killed a quarter of those infected, and up to five million in all.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm Past pandemics that ravaged Europe].

* [[Plague of Justinian]], from 541 to 750, was the first recorded outbreak of the [[bubonic plague]]. It started in [[Egypt]], and reached [[Constantinople]] the following spring, killing (according to the Byzantine chronicler [[Procopius]]) 10,000 a day at its height, and perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants. The plague went on to eliminate a quarter to a half of the [[human population]] that it struck throughout the known world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521846390&ss=fro |title=Cambridge Catalogue page "Plague and the End of Antiquity" |publisher=Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref><ref>[http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html Quotes from book "Plague and the End of Antiquity"] Lester K.

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. Disease killed part of the native population of the [[Canary Islands]] in the 16th century ([[Guanches]]). Half the native population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1518 was killed by smallpox. Smallpox also ravaged [[Mexico]] in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in [[Tenochtitlán]] alone, including the emperor, and [[Peru]] in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_01.shtml |title=Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> [[Measles]] killed a further two million Mexican natives in the 17th century.

* The "[[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2#Russian flu|Asiatic Flu]]", 1889–1890, was first reported in May 1889 in [[Bukhara]], Uzbekistan. By October, it had reached [[Tomsk]] and the [[Caucasus]]. It rapidly spread west and hit [[North America]] in December 1889, South America in February–April 1890, India in February–March 1890, and Australia in March–April 1890.

=== Typhus ===

[[Typhus]] is sometimes called "camp fever" because of its pattern of flaring up in times of strife. (It is also known as "gaol fever" and "ship fever", for its habits of spreading wildly in cramped quarters, such as jails and ships.) Emerging during the [[Crusades]], it had its first impact in Europe in 1489, in Spain. During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in [[Italy]], and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish. In 1542, 30,000 soldiers died of typhus while fighting the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the Balkans.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), about 8 million Germans were killed by bubonic plague and typhus fever.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence]. ''TIME.'' April 29, 1940</ref> The disease also played a major role in the destruction of [[Napoleon]]'s ''[[La Grande Armée|Grande Armée]]'' in Russia in 1812. Felix Markham thinks that 450,000 soldiers crossed the [[Neman River|Neman]] on 25 June 1812, of whom less than 40,000 recrossed in anything like a recognizable military formation.<ref>See a large copy of the chart here: http://www.adept-plm.com/Newsletter/NapoleonsMarch.htm, but discussed at length in Edward Tufte, ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information'' (London: Graphics Press, 1992)</ref> In early 1813 Napoleon raised a new army of 500,000 to replace his Russian losses. In the campaign of that year over 219,000 of Napoleon's soldiers were to die of typhus.<ref name=Typhus/>  Typhus played a major factor in the [[Irish Potato Famine]]. During [[World War I]], typhus epidemics killed over 150,000 in [[Serbia]]. There were about 25 million infections and 3 million deaths from [[epidemic typhus]]
in [[Russia]] from 1918 to 1922.<ref name=Typhus>{{cite web |url=http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/TYPHUS-Conlon.pdf |format=PDF |title=The historical impact of epidemic typhus |author=Joseph M.

=== Smallpox ===
Smallpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the [[Variola virus]]. The disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans per year during the closing years of the 18th century.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=vacc.chapter.3 Smallpox and Vaccinia].

=== Measles ===
Historically, [[measles]] was prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. According to the National Immunization Program, 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were an estimated 3–4 million
cases in the U.S. each year.<ref name=autogenerated1>Center for Disease Control & National Immunization Program. Measles History, article online 2001. Available from http://www.cdc.gov.nip/diseases/measles/history.htm</ref> In roughly the last 150 years, measles has been estimated to have killed about 200 million people worldwide.<ref name=Measles/> In 2000 alone, measles killed some 777,000 worldwide.
There were some 40 million cases of measles globally that year.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stein CE, Birmingham M, Kurian M, Duclos P, Strebel P |title=The global burden of measles in the year 2000—a model that uses country-specific indicators |journal=J.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to a new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in [[Cuba]] killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox.<ref>''Man and Microbes: Disease and Plagues in History and Modern Times''; by Arno Karlen</ref> The disease had ravaged [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Inca]] civilization.<ref>[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/RUVALCA1.ART "Measles and Small Pox as an Allied Army of the Conquistadors of America"] by Carlos Ruvalcaba, translated by Theresa M.

=== Leprosy ===
[[Leprosy]], also known as Wopat’s or Hansen's Disease, is caused by a [[bacillus]], ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]''.  It is a [[chronic disease]] with an incubation period of up to five years. Since 1985, 15 million people worldwide have been cured of leprosy.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6522023.stm Leprosy 'could pose new threat']. BBC News.

[[Malaria]] is widespread in [[Tropics|tropical]] and subtropical regions, including parts of the [[Americas]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]].

=== Yellow fever ===
[[Yellow fever]] has been a source of several devastating epidemics.<ref>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Yellow_Fever Yellow Fever – LoveToKnow 1911].</ref> Cities as far north as New York, Philadelphia, and Boston were hit with epidemics.

The New York Times, October 15, 1995.</ref>

=== Unknown causes ===

There are also a number of unknown diseases that were extremely serious but have now vanished, so the [[etiology]] of these diseases cannot be established. The cause of ''[[Sweating sickness|English Sweat]]'' in 16th-century England, which struck people down in an instant and was more greatly feared than even the [[bubonic plague]], is still unknown.

== Concern about possible future pandemics ==

=== Viral hemorrhagic fevers ===
{{Main|Viral hemorrhagic fever}}

Viruses causing viral hemorrhagic fever such as [[Lassa fever virus]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Marburg virus]], [[Ebola|Ebola virus]] and [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]] are highly contagious and deadly diseases, with the theoretical potential to become pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected vector, and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[quarantine]] vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance}}
Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, sometimes referred to as "[[Antibiotic resistance|superbug]]s", may contribute to the re-emergence of diseases which are currently well controlled.<ref>[http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/07pesteTIGR_E.htm Researchers sound the alarm: the multidrug resistance of the plague bacillus could spread]. Pasteur.fr</ref> For example, cases of tuberculosis that are resistant to traditionally effective treatments remain a cause of great concern to health professionals. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of [[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB]. ''World Health Organization.''</ref> China and India have the highest rate of multidrug-resistant TB.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/apr/01/bill-gates-tb-timebomb-china Bill Gates joins Chinese government in tackling TB 'timebomb']. ''Guardian.co.uk''. April 1, 2009</ref> The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with MDR TB, with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics. In 2005, 124 cases of [[MDR TB]] were reported in the United States. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis ([[XDR TB]]) was identified in Africa in 2006, and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries, including the United States. There are about 40,000 new cases of XDR-TB per year, the WHO estimates.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/17/tb.pandemic/index.html Tuberculosis: A new pandemic?]. CNN.com</ref>

In the past 20 years, common bacteria including ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' and [[Enterococcus]], have developed resistance to various [[antibiotics]] such as [[vancomycin]], as well as whole classes of antibiotics, such as the [[aminoglycosides]] and [[cephalosporins]]. Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years. <!-- Antibiotics are not described as "strongest"; each has a specific range of activity. Antibiotics that are effective against many types of bacteria are termed "broad spectrum". Vancomycin is only effective against Gram-positive organisms, such as sensitive strains of ''S. aureus'' and Enterococcus. --> <!-- HAIs are a serious concern, but do not meet the definition of a pandemic -->

Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and [[overuse of antibiotic]]s have been an element in the emergence of resistant [[bacteria]]. The problem is further exacerbated by self-prescribing of antibiotics by individuals without the guidelines of a qualified clinician and the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture.<ref name=Larson2007>{{cite journal |author=Larson E |title=Community factors in the development of antibiotic resistance |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=28 |pages=435–47 |year=2007 |pmid=17094768 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020 }}</ref>

=== SARS ===

In 2003, there were concerns that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ([[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]]), a new and highly contagious form of [[atypical pneumonia]], might become pandemic. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.

=== Influenza ===

Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses. Occasionally, viruses are transmitted from these species to other species, and may then cause outbreaks in domestic poultry or, rarely, in humans.<ref name=sobrino6>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir |author=Klenk et al. |year=2008 |chapter=Avian Influenza: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Host Range |title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-22-6}}</ref><ref name=Kawaoka>{{cite book |author=Kawaoka Y (editor). |title=Influenza Virology: Current Topics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2006 |url=http://www.horizonpress.com/flu |isbn=978-1-904455-06-6}}</ref>

==== H5N1 (Avian Flu) ====
{{Main|Influenza A virus subtype H5N1}}

In February 2004, [[avian influenza]] virus was detected in birds in [[Vietnam]], increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish Flu]], or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].

From October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the US.<ref>{{cite web |author=MacKenzie D |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}</ref>

In May 2005, scientists urgently call nations to prepare for a global [[influenza pandemic]] that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref>

In October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: "We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China." Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in [[Romania]], and then [[Greece]]. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm |title=Bird flu is confirmed in Greece |work=BBC NEWS |date=17 October 2005 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref>

By November 2007, numerous confirmed cases of the [[H5N1]] strain had been identified across Europe.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/05/bird_flu_map/html/1.stm |title=Bird Flu Map |work=BBC NEWS | accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref>  However, by the end of October only 59 people had died as a result of H5N1 which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.

Avian flu cannot yet be categorized as a "pandemic", because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human, but as of December 2006 there have been very few (if any) cases of proven human-to-human transmission.<ref>WHO (2005). Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Infection in Humans http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra052211</ref> Regular influenza viruses establish infection by attaching to receptors in the throat and lungs, but the avian influenza virus can only attach to receptors located deep in the lungs of humans, requiring close, prolonged contact with infected patients, and thus limiting person-to-person transmission.

== Biological warfare ==
In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged [[Crimea]]n city of [[Caffa|Kaffa]] (now [[Feodosiya|Theodosia]]). After a protracted siege, during which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. It has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the arrival of the [[Black Death]] in Europe.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wheelis M |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971–5 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12194776 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol8no9/01-0536.htm |pmc=2732530}}</ref>

The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population was devastated after contact with the [[Old World]] due to the introduction of many different fatal diseases. There is, however, only one documented case of germ warfare, involving British commander [[Jeffrey Amherst]] and Swiss-British officer Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]], whose correspondence included a reference to the idea of giving smallpox-infected blankets to Indians as part of an incident known as [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] which occurred during the [[Pontiac's Rebellion#Siege of Fort Pitt|Siege of Fort Pitt]] (1763) late in the [[French and Indian War]].<ref>{{cite book

For historians who believe the attempt at infection was successful, see Nester, ''Haughty Conquerors"'', 112; Jennings, ''Empire of Fortune'', 447–48.</ref>

During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), [[Unit 731]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conducted [[Japanese war crimes#Human experimentation and biological warfare|human experimentation]] on thousands, mostly Chinese. In military campaigns, the Japanese army used biological weapons on Chinese soldiers and civilians. Plague fleas, infected clothing, and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets. The resulting [[cholera]], [[anthrax]], and plague were estimated to have killed around 400,000 Chinese civilians.<ref>{{cite news |title=Doctors of Depravity |publisher=Daily Mail |author=Christopher Hudson |date=2 March 2007 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=439776&in_page_id=1770 | location=London}}</ref>

Diseases considered for or known to be used as a weapon include [[anthrax]], [[ebola]], [[Marburg virus]], plague, [[cholera]], [[typhus]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[tularemia]], [[brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[machupo]], [[Coccidioides mycosis]], [[Glanders]], [[Melioidosis]], [[Shigella]],  [[Psittacosis]], [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese B encephalitis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and smallpox.<ref name="Alibek"/>

Spores of weaponized anthrax were accidentally released from a military facility near the Soviet [[closed city]] of [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] in 1979. The [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]] is sometimes called "biological [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]".<ref name="Alibek">[[Ken Alibek]] and S. Handelman.
