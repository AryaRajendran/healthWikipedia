A '''surgical  instrument''' is a specially designed tool or device for performing specific actions of carrying out desired effects during a [[surgery]] or operation, such as modifying [[biological tissue]], or to provide access for viewing it. Over time, many different kinds of surgical instruments and tools have been invented.  Some surgical instruments are designed for general use in surgery, while others are designed for a specific procedure or surgery. Accordingly, the nomenclature of surgical instruments follows certain patterns, such as a description of the action it performs (for example, [[scalpel]], [[hemostat]]), the name of its inventor(s) (for example, the [[Kocher forceps]]), or a compound scientific name related to the kind of surgery (for example, a [[tracheotome]] is a tool used to perform a [[tracheotomy]]).

The expression '''surgical instrumentation''' is somewhat interchangeably used with surgical instruments, but its meaning in medical jargon is really the activity of providing assistance to a surgeon with the proper handling of surgical instruments during an operation, by a specialized professional, usually a [[surgical technologist]] or sometimes a [[nurse]] or radiologic technologist. 
==Classification==

There are several classes of surgical instruments:

* Graspers, such as [[forceps]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shopmedvet.com/category/instruments-forceps|title=Types of forceps}}</ref> 
* Clamps and occluders for [[blood vessel]]s and other organs
* [[retractor (medical)|Retractor]]s, used to spread open [[skin]], [[rib]]s and other tissue
* [[Distractor]]s, positioners and [[stereotactic surgery|stereotactic devices]]
* Mechanical cutters ([[scalpel]]s, [[Scalpel|lancet]]s, [[drill bit]]s, [[rasp]]s, [[trocar]]s, [[Ligasure]], [[Harmonic scalpel]] etc.)
* [[Dilator]]s and [[speculum (medical)|specula]], for access to narrow passages or incisions
* [[Suction]] tips and tubes, for removal of bodily fluids
* Sealing devices, such as [[surgical staple]]rs
* Irrigation and [[hypodermic needle|injection needles]], tips and tubes, for introducing fluid
* [[Tyndaller]]s, to help "wedge" open damaged tissues in the brain.
* Powered devices, such as [[drill]]s, [[dermatome (instrument)|dermatome]]s
* Scopes and probes, including [[fiber optic]] [[endoscope]]s and tactile probes
* Carriers and appliers for [[optics|optical]], electronic and mechanical devices
* [[Ultrasound]] [[Cell disruption|tissue disruptors]], [[cryotome]]s and cutting [[laser]] guides
* Measurement devices, such as [[ruler]]s and [[caliper]]s
       
An important relative distinction, regarding surgical instruments, is the amount of bodily disruption or tissue [[Physical trauma|trauma]] that their use might cause the patient. Terms relating to this issue are 'atraumatic' and [[minimally invasive]]. Minimally invasive systems are an important recent development in surgery.
