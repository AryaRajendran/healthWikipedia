{{see also|Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan}}

A '''pre-existing condition''' is a risk with extant causes that is not readily compensated by standard, affordable [[insurance premium]]s. Pre-existing condition exclusions by the [[insurance industry]] are meant to cope with [[adverse selection]] by potential customers. Such exclusions have become a topic in the [[health care reform debate in the United States]] in 2009 and 2010. Several surveys over that period have shown a very strong opposition to the exclusions and support for banning them.<ref name="Abt SRBI">{{cite web |author=. |date=July 29, 2009|url=http://www.srbi.com/TimePoll4794_Final_%20Report.pdf|title=TIME magazine/Abt SRBI — July 27–28, 2009 survey |location=New York |publisher=[http://www.srbi.com/what_we_do.html Abt SRBI] |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}</ref><ref name="KFF tracking poll">{{cite web |author=. |date=September 29, 2009 |title=Kaiser Health Tracking Poll—September 2009: Public opinion on health care issues |url=http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/upload/7990.pdf |accessdate=January 16, 2010 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]]}}</ref>

==Definitions==
The [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] defines a pre-existing condition as a "medical condition that occurred before a program of health benefits went into effect."<ref>{{cite web |author=. |year=2010 |url=http://www.upmc.com/HOSPITALSFACILITIES/FINANCIAL-SERVICES/Pages/billing-terminology.aspx|accessdate=January 16, 2010|location=Pittsburgh|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (UPMC)|title=Billing terminology}}</ref> J. James Rohack, president of the [[American Medical Association]], has stated on a ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'' interview that exclusions, based upon these conditions, function as a form of "[[Healthcare rationing in the United States|rationing]]" of health care.<ref name="jacobson">{{cite news |author=Jacobson, Louis |date=August 18, 2009 |title=Pregnancy a 'pre-existing condition'?

Conditions can be broken down into two further categories, according to Lisa Smith of [[Investopedia]]:
{{quote|Most insurance companies use one of two definitions to identify such conditions. Under the "objective standard" definition, a pre-existing condition is any condition for which the patient has already received medical advice or treatment prior to enrollment in a new medical insurance plan. Under the broader, "prudent person" definition, a pre-existing condition is anything for which symptoms were present and a prudent person would have sought treatment.<ref name="smith">{{cite web |author=Smith, Lisa |date=February 16, 2009 |title=Health insurance: paying for pre-existing conditions |publisher=[[Investopedia]]|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/covering-medical-costs.asp |accessdate=January 17, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>}}

Which definition may be used is sometimes regulated by state laws.  Some states require insurance companies to use the objective standard, while others require the prudent person standard.  Currently, 10 states do not specify either definition, 21 require the "prudent person" standard, and 18 require the "objective" standard, according to [http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparetable.jsp?typ=5&ind=355&cat=7&sub=87&sortc=2&o=a www.statehealthfacts.org].

==Current and pending pre-existing condition exclusion regulation in the United States==
Regulation of pre-existing condition exclusions in individual (non-group) and small group (2 to 50 employees) health insurance plans in the [[United States]] is left to individual [[U.S. state]]s as a result of the [[McCarran–Ferguson Act]] of 1945 which delegated insurance regulation to the states and the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 (ERISA) which exempted self-insured large group health insurance plans from state regulation. After most states had by the early 1990s implemented some limits on pre-existing condition exclusions by small group (2 to 50 employees) health insurance plans, the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] ([[Nancy Landon Kassebaum|Kassebaum]]-[[Ted Kennedy|Kennedy]] Act) of 1996 (HIPAA) extended some minimal limits on pre-existing condition exclusions for ''all'' group health insurance plans—including the self-insured large group health insurance plans that cover half of those with employer-provided health insurance but are exempt from state insurance regulation.<ref name=kassebaum-kennedy>{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.13.1.327 |author=Gabel, Jon; Liston, Derek; Jensen, Gail; Marsteller, Jill |date=Spring 1994 |title=The health insurance picture in 1993: some rare good news |journal=[[Health Affairs]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=327–336 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/13/1/327.pdf |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |pmid=8188152}}<br />{{cite web |author=Kassebaum, Nancy Landon; Kennedy, Edward M.; et al. |date=August 21, 1996 |title=Public Law 104-191.

==Practices and effects==
Advocates against pre-existing condition rules argue that they cruelly deny needy people treatment. [[State Farm]] spokeswoman K.C. Eynatten has said, "We realized our position was based on gut feelings, not hard numbers... we became aware that we were part of the reason a woman and her children might not leave an abuser. They were afraid they'd lose their insurance. And we wanted no part of that."<ref name="grim"/> Jerry Flanagan, health-care policy director of [[Consumer Watchdog]], has stated that "insurance companies want premiums without any risk" and go to extreme "lengths... to go to make a profit".<ref name="hilzenrath"/> [http://allinsuranceinfo.org/ InsureMe], an insurance quote provider website, has argued that even though health insurance is basically to protect people from very high costs of health care, the commercial health insurance system is not playing fair and are always trying to avoid risk in order to boost their profits.<ref>{{cite web |author=. |year=2007 |url=http://allinsuranceinfo.org/health/tricks.html |title=Health insurance tricks to beware of|accessdate=January 20, 2010|publisher=[http://allinsuranceinfo.org/misc/about.html allinsuranceinfo.org]}}</ref>

Some practices by some [[health insurance]] companies, such as determining [[domestic violence]] to be an excludable pre-existing condition, have been called abuses by Maria Tchijov, a [[Service Employees International Union]] new media coordinator, and by an [[Office of Rural Health Policy]] report.<ref name="grim">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/14/when-getting-beaten-by-yo_n_286029.html|accessdate=September 19, 2009|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|title=When getting beaten by your husband is a pre-existing condition|first=Brian|last=Grim|date=September 14, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Johnson, Rhonda M. |date=August 30, 2000 |title=Rural health response to domestic violence: policy and practice issues |url=http://ruralhealth.hrsa.gov/pub/domviol.htm |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Office of Rural Health Policy]] |accessdate=September 15, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Tchijov, Maria |url=http://www.seiu.org/2009/09/domestic-violence-victims-have-a-pre-existing-condition.php|title=Domestic violence is a 'pre-existing condition'? |work=SEIU Blog |publisher=[[Service Employees International Union]]|accessdate=September 15, 2009|date=September 11, 2009}}</ref>

The rationale behind pre-existing condition clauses, according to those who defend the policies, is that they reduce the cost of health insurance coverage for those who still receive it, thus giving more people an opportunity to afford insurance in the first place.<ref name=brian>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/14/when-getting-beaten-by-yo_n_286029.html|accessdate=January 16, 2010|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|title=When Getting Beaten By Your Husband Is A Pre-Existing Condition|first=Brian|last=Grim|date=September 14, 2009}}</ref><ref name=chronicle>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-11-17/news/17182067_1_health-care-health-insurance-pre-existing-medical-problems|publisher=''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]''|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=January 16, 2010|title=Americans fear health law's costs poll finds|author1=Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar|author2=Trevor Tompson}}</ref> ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'' has reported that "[c]osts for those with coverage could go up because people in poor health who'd been shut out of the insurance pool would now be included... they would get medical care they could not access before."<ref name=chronicle/> [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Mike Enzi]], a [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] from [[Wyoming]], has voted to allow insurance companies to consider domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and supported his vote by saying that covering such people could raise insurance premiums to the point where it would preclude others from buying it.

According to the California-based advocacy group [[Consumer Watchdog]], other possible situations falling under pre-existing condition clauses are chronic conditions as [[acne]], [[hemorrhoids]], [[toenail fungus]], [[allergies]], [[tonsillitis]], and [[bunion]]s, hazardous occupations such as [[police officer]], [[Stunt actor|stunt person]], [[test pilot]], [[Circus skills|circus worker]], and [[firefighter]], and [[pregnancy]] and/or [[Adoption|the intention to adopt]].<ref name="hilzenrath">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/18/AR2009091803501.html|title=Acne, pregnancy among disqualifying conditions|date=September 19, 2009|accessdate=January 16, 2010|first=David S.|last=Hilzenrath|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A3}}</ref>

==Commentary by lawmakers==
According to a [[Reason (magazine)|Reason.com]] [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] opinion blog by Peter Suderman, the '[[Pledge to America]]' issued by the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in September 2010 stated that: "Health care should be accessible for all, regardless of pre-existing conditions or past illnesses...

==Public opinion==
A ''[[Time Magazine]]''-Abt SRBI poll in late July 2009 found that a large majority of Americans (80%) favored a requirement that insurance companies insure people even if they suffer from pre-existing conditions.<ref name="Abt SRBI"/>

In September 2009, the monthly [[Kaiser Family Foundation|Kaiser Health Tracking Poll]] report said:
{{quote|The public’s most unanimous and bipartisan support is saved for a proposal to have the federal government require that health insurance companies cover anyone who applies, even if he/she has a pre-existing condition.
