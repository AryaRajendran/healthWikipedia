'''Primary ciliary dyskinesia''' ('''PCD'''), also known as '''immotile ciliary syndrome''', is a rare, [[ciliopathy|ciliopathic]], [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[genetic disorder]] that causes a defect in the action of the [[cilia]] lining the [[respiratory tract]] (lower and upper, [[sinuses]], [[Eustachian tube]], [[middle ear]]) and [[fallopian tube]], and also of the [[flagella]] of [[sperm]] in males.  

Respiratory [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[Cilia#Types and distribution|motile cilia]], which resemble microscopic "hairs" (although structurally and biologically unrelated to [[hair]]), are complex [[organelle]]s that beat synchronously in the respiratory tract, moving mucus toward the throat.  Normally, cilia beat 7 to 22 times per second, and any impairment can result in poor [[mucociliary clearance]], with subsequent upper and lower respiratory infection.  Cilia also are involved in other biological processes (such as [[nitric oxide]] production), which are currently the subject of dozens of research efforts.  As the functions of cilia become better understood, the understanding of PCD should be expected to advance.

==Classification==
[[Image:Primary ciliary dyskinesia 7.jpg|thumb|Axial CT image showing situs inversus. The slice is seen from below, with the liver and IVC on the left and the spleen and aorta on the right.]]

[[Image:Primary ciliary dyskinesia-10.jpg|thumb|Axial CT image showing dextrocardia with the IVC and morphologic right ventricle on the left and the left ventricle on the right.]]

[[Image:Primary ciliary dyskinesia-8.jpg|thumb|Axial CT image showing chronic sinusitis in an individual with Kartagener syndrome.]]
When accompanied by the combination of [[situs inversus]] (reversal of the internal organs), [[chronic sinusitis]], and [[bronchiectasis]], it is known as Kartagener syndrome. The phrase "immotile ciliary syndrome" is no longer favored as the cilia do have movement, but may be inefficient or unsychronized.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Primary ciliary dyskinesia-12.jpg|thumb|Sagittal CT image showing "tree in bud" appearance of mucous impaction in distal small airways related to primary ciliary dyskinesia.]]

[[Image:Primary ciliary dyskinesia-1.jpg|thumb|CT image showing dilated and thickened medium sized airways (bronchiectaisis)in a patient with Kartagener syndrome.]]

[[Image:Primary ciliary dyskinesia-6.jpg|thumb|Oblique sagittal CT image showing lower lobe cylinidrical bronchiectasis in the same patient.]]
The main consequence of impaired ciliary function is reduced or absent [[mucus]] clearance from the [[lung]]s, and susceptibility to chronic recurrent respiratory infections, including [[sinusitis]], [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], and [[otitis media]].  Progressive damage to the respiratory system is common, including progressive bronchiectasis beginning in early childhood, and sinus disease (sometimes becoming severe in adults).  However, diagnosis is often missed early in life despite the characteristic signs and symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12162599 |year=2002 |month= |author=Coren, Me; Meeks, M; Morrison, I; Buchdahl, Rm; Bush, A |title=Primary ciliary dyskinesia: age at diagnosis and symptom history |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=667–9 |journal=Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992) |doi=10.1080/080352502760069089}}</ref> In males, immotility of sperm can lead to [[infertility]], although conception remains possible through the use of [[in vitro fertilization]] and, as well as this, there have been reported cases where sperm were able to move.<ref>http://www.pcdsupport.org.uk/index.php/faqs/will_it_be_difficult_to_have_children/</ref> Trials have also shown that there is a marked reduction in fertility in female sufferers of Kartagener's Syndrome due to dysfunction of the oviductal cilia.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3488922</ref>

Many affected individuals experience [[hearing loss]] and show symptoms of [[otitis media|glue ear]] which demonstrate variable responsiveness to the insertion of [[myringotomy]] tubes or [[grommet]]s.  Some patients have a poor sense of smell, which is believed to accompany high [[mucus]] production in the sinuses (although others report normal - or even acute - sensitivity to smell and taste). Clinical progression of the disease is variable with [[organ transplant|lung transplantation]] required in severe cases.  Susceptibility to infections can be drastically reduced by an early diagnosis.  Treatment with various chest physiotherapy techniques has been observed to reduce the incidence of lung infection and to slow the progression of bronchiectasis dramatically.  Aggressive treatment of sinus disease beginning at an early age is believed to slow long-term sinus damage (although this has not yet been adequately documented).  Aggressive measures to enhance clearance of mucus, prevent respiratory infections, and treat bacterial superinfections have been observed to slow lung-disease progression. Although the true incidence of the disease is unknown, it is estimated to be 1 in 32,000,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ceccaldi PF, Carre-Pigeon F, Youinou Y, Delepine B, Bryckaert PE, Harika G, Quereux C, Gaillard D. |title=Kartagener's syndrome and infertility: observation, diagnosis and treatment |journal=J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod. (Paris) |year=2004 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=192–4 }}</ref> 
although the actual incidence may be as high as 1 in 15,000.

There is an international effort to identify genes that code for inner dynein arm proteins or proteins from other ciliary structures (radial spokes, central apparatus, etc.) associated with PCD.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  The role of DNAH5 in [[heterotaxy]] syndromes and left-right asymmetry is also under investigation.

==Pathophysiology==
This disease is genetically inherited.  Structures that make up the cilia including inner and/or outer [[dynein]] arms, central apparatus, radial spokes, etc. are missing or dysfunctional and thus the [[axoneme]] structure lacks the ability to move. [[Axoneme]]s are the elongated structures that make up [[cilia]] and [[flagella]].  Additionally, there may be chemical defects that interfere with ciliary function in the presence of adequate structure.  Whatever the underlying cause, dysfunction of the cilia begins during and impacts the [[embryo]]logic phase of development.

Specialised monocilia are at the heart of this problem. They lack the central-pair microtubules of ordinary motile cilia and so rotate clockwise rather than beat; in [[Hensen's node]] at the anterior end of the [[primitive streak]] in the embryo, these are angled posteriorly<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15118088 |year=2004 |month=May |author=Cartwright, Jh; Piro, O; Tuval, I |title=Fluid-dynamical basis of the embryonic development of left-right asymmetry in vertebrates |volume=101 |issue=19 |pages=7234–9 |pmc=409902 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0402001101 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15118088 |format=Free full text}}</ref><ref name="Nonaka">{{cite journal |pmid=16035921 |year=2005 |month=August |author=Nonaka, S; Yoshiba, S; Watanabe, D; Ikeuchi, S; Goto, T; Marshall, Wf; Hamada, H |title=De novo formation of left-right asymmetry by posterior tilt of nodal cilia |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=e268 |pmc=1180513 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030268 |journal=PLoS Biology |url=http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030268 |format=Free full text}}</ref> such that they prescribe a D-shape rather than a circle.<ref name="Nonaka"/> This has been shown to generate a net leftward flow in mouse and chick embryos, and sweeps the [[Sonic Hedgehog]] (''Shh'') [[protein]] to the left, triggering normal asymmetrical development.

However, in some individuals with PCD, mutations thought to be in the gene coding for the key structural protein left-right [[dynein]] (''lrd'')<ref name="Chodhari"/> result in monocilia which do not rotate.  There is therefore no flow generated in the node, ''Shh'' moves at random within it, and 50% of those affected develop [[situs inversus]] which can occur with or without [[dextrocardia]], where the laterality of the [[viscera|internal organs]] is the mirror-image of normal. Affected individuals therefore have Kartagener syndrome. This is not the case with some PCD-related genetic mutations: at least 6%{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} of the PCD population have a condition called [[situs ambiguus]] or heterotaxy where organ placement or development is neither typical ([[situs solitus]]) nor totally reversed ([[situs inversus totalis]]) but is a hybrid of the two. Splenic abnormalities such as [[polysplenia]], [[asplenia]] and complex congenital heart defects are more common in individuals with situs ambiguus and PCD, as they are in all individuals with situs ambiguus.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17515466 |year=2007 |month=June |author=Kennedy, Mp; Omran, H; Leigh, Mw; Dell, S; Morgan, L; Molina, Pl; Robinson, Bv; Minnix, Sl; Olbrich, H; Severin, T; Ahrens, P; Lange, L; Morillas, Hn; Noone, Pg; Zariwala, Ma; Knowles, Mr |title=Congenital heart disease and other heterotaxic defects in a large cohort of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia |volume=115 |issue=22 |pages=2814–21 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.649038 |journal=Circulation |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17515466 |format=Free full text}}</ref>

The genetic forces linking failure of nodal monocilia and situs issues and the relationship of those forces to PCD are the subject of intense research interest.  For now hypotheses abound—some, like the one above, are generally accepted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  However, knowledge in this area is constantly advancing.

=== Relation to other rare genetic disorders ===

Recent findings in genetic research have suggested that a large number of [[genetic disorder]]s, both [[Syndrome|genetic syndromes]] and [[Disease|genetic diseases]], that were not previously identified in the medical literature as related, may be, in fact, highly related in the [[genotype|genetypical]] root cause of the widely-varying, [[phenotype|phenotypically]]-observed [[Disorder (medicine)|disorders]].  Thus, PCD is a [[ciliopathy]].  Other known ciliopathies include [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]], [[polycystic kidney disease|polycystic kidney]] and [[polycystic liver disease|liver disease]], [[nephronophthisis]], [[Alstrom syndrome]], [[Meckel-Gruber syndrome]] and some forms of [[Retinopathy|retinal degeneration]].<ref>{{cite journal
