'''Perspiration''' ('''sweating''', [[transpiration]], or [[diaphoresis]]) is the production of fluids secreted by the [[sweat gland]]s in the [[skin]] of [[mammal]]s.<ref name="perspiration">{{cite journal |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/99/3/781.pdf |title=Simultaneous Study of Constituents of Urine and Perspiration |author=Mosher HH |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |year=1933 |volume=99 |pages=781–790 |issue=3}}</ref><br />
Two types of [[sweat gland]]s can be found in humans: [[Eccrine gland]]s and [[Apocrine sweat gland|apocrine gland]]s. The eccrine sweat glands are distributed over much of the body.

In [[human]]s, sweating is primarily a means of [[thermoregulation]] which is achieved by the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands. Maximum sweat rates of an adult can be up to 2-4 liters per hour or 10-14 liters per day (10-15 g/min•m²)<ref>Jessen,C., Temperature regulation in humans and other mammals, Springer, Berlin, 2000, 193 pp</ref><ref>Mack,G.W. and Nadel,E.R., Body fluid balance during heat stress in humans.

[[Evaporation]] of sweat from the skin surface has a cooling effect due to the [[evaporation]] of water. Hence, in [[Temperature|hot]] weather, or when the individual's muscles heat up due to exertion, more sweat is produced. Animals with few sweat glands, such as [[dog]]s, accomplish similar temperature regulation results by panting, which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral cavity and [[pharynx]]. [[Primates]] and horses have armpits that sweat like those of humans. Although sweating is found in a wide variety of mammals,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goglia G |title=[Further research on the branched sweat glands in some mammals (Cavia cobaya, Sus scrofa, Equus caballus).] |language=Undetermined |journal=Bollettino Della Società Italiana Di Biologia Sperimentale |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=58–60 |year=1953 |month=January |pmid=13066656}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Robertshaw D, Taylor CR |title=Sweat gland function of the donkey (Equus asinus) |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=205 |issue=1 |pages=79–89 |year=1969 |month=November |pmid=5347721 |pmc=1348626 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=5347721}}</ref> relatively few, such as humans and horses, produce large amounts of sweat in order to cool down.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McDonald RE, Fleming RI, Beeley JG, ''et al.'' |title=Latherin: A Surfactant Protein of Horse Sweat and Saliva |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=e5726 |year=2009 |pmid=19478940 |pmc=2684629 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005726 |editor1-last=Koutsopoulos |editor1-first=Sotirios}}</ref>

A study has discovered that men, on average, start perspiring much more quickly than women, then twice as much when they are in the middle of exercising at the same relative intensity.<ref>{{cite news|title=Women outshine men in sweat test|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/lifematters/women-outshine-men-in-sweat-test-20101008-16c0c.html |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 October 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> When men and women exercise at the same absolute intensity there are no differences in sweating responses.

==Definition==
*[[Hypohidrosis]] is decreased sweating from whatever cause.<ref name="allaboutsweat.com">[http://www.allaboutsweat.com Academy of Hyperhidrosis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*[[Focal hyperhidrosis]] is increased or excessive sweating in certain regions such as the underarms, palms, soles, face or groin.
*[[Hyperhidrosis]], also referred to as generalized or secondary hyperhidrosis is excessive sweating due to an underlying condition and usually involves the body as a whole.<ref name="allaboutsweat.com"/>
*Hidromeiosis is a reduction in sweating that is due to blockages of sweat glands in humid conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Parsons K |title=Maintaining health, comfort and productivity in heat waves |jou =Glob Health Action |volume=2 |issue= |pages= |year=2009 |pmid=20052377 |pmc=2799322 |doi=10.3402/gha.v2i0.2057 |url=}}</ref>

Sweating allows the body to regulate its temperature. Sweating is controlled from a center in the preoptic and anterior regions of the brain's [[hypothalamus]], where thermosensitive neurons are located. The heat-regulatory function of the hypothalamus is also affected by inputs from temperature receptors in the [[skin]]. High skin temperature reduces the hypothalamic set point for sweating and increases the [[gain]] of the hypothalamic [[feedback]] system in response to variations in core [[temperature]]. Overall, however, the sweating response to a rise in hypothalamic ('core') temperature is much larger than the response to the same increase in average skin temperature. 

Sweating causes a decrease in core temperature through [[evaporative cooling]] at the skin surface. As high energy molecules evaporate from the skin, releasing energy absorbed from the body, the skin and superficial vessels decrease in temperature. Cooled venous blood then returns to the body's core and counteracts rising core temperatures.

There are two situations in which the nerves will stimulate the sweat glands, causing perspiration: during physical heat and during emotional stress. In general, emotionally induced sweating is restricted to palms, soles, armpits, and sometimes the forehead, while physical heat-induced sweating occurs throughout the body.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-2670(97)00642-9 |first1=Tomoya |last1=Kameia |first2=Takao |last2=Tsudab |first3=Shinya |last3=Kitagawab |first4=Ken |last4=Naitoha |first5=Koji |last5=Nakashimaa |first6=Toshio |last6=Ohhashi |month=June |year=1998 |title=Physical stimuli and emotional stress-induced sweat secretions in the human palm and forehead |journal=Analytica Chimica Acta |volume=365 |issue=1–3 |pages=319–326}}</ref>

Sweat is not pure [[water]]; it always contains a small amount (0.2–1%) of [[Solution|solute]]. When a person moves from a [[cold]] [[climate]] to a [[hot]] climate, adaptive changes occur in the sweating mechanisms of the person. This process is referred to as [[acclimatisation]]: the maximum rate of sweating increases and its solute composition decreases. The volume of water lost in sweat daily is highly variable, ranging from 100 to 8,000 mL/day. The solute loss can be as much as 350&nbsp;mmol/day (or 90&nbsp;mmol/day acclimatised) of [[sodium]] under the most extreme conditions. During average intensity exercise, sweat losses can average up to 2 litres of water/hour.  In a cool climate and in the absence of [[exercise]], sodium loss can be very low (less than 5 mmols/day). Sodium concentration in sweat is 30-65&nbsp;mmol/l, depending on the degree of acclimatisation.

Sweat contains mainly [[water]]. It also contains [[minerals]], [[Lactic acid|lactate]], and [[urea]]. Mineral composition varies with the individual, their [[acclimatisation]] to [[heat]], [[exercise]] and sweating, the particular [[stress (biological)|stress]] source ([[sauna]], etc.), the duration of sweating, and the composition of minerals in the [[body]].
An indication of the minerals content is [[sodium]] ({{nobreak|0.9 gram/liter}}), [[potassium]] ({{nobreak|0.2 g/l}}), [[calcium]] ({{nobreak|0.015 g/l}}), [[magnesium]] ({{nobreak|0.0013 g/l}}).<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18156662 "Sweat mineral-element responses during 7 h of exercise-heat stress," ''Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab'' 2007 Dec;17(6):574-82.]</ref>
Also many other [[trace elements]] are excreted in sweat, again an indication of their concentration is (although measurements can vary fifteenfold) [[zinc]] ({{nobreak|0.4 milligrams/liter}}), [[copper]] ({{nobreak|0.3–0.8 mg/l}}), [[iron]] ({{nobreak|1 mg/l}}), [[chromium]] ({{nobreak|0.1 mg/l}}), [[nickel]] ({{nobreak|0.05 mg/l}}), [[lead]] ({{nobreak|0.05 mg/l}}).<ref>{{cite journal
