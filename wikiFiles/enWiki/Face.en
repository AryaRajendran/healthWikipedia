{{double image|right|faceMars4.jpg|150|Martian face viking cropped.jpg|150|The [[face perception]] mechanisms of the brain, such as the [[fusiform face area]], can produce facial [[pareidolia]]s such as in images of [[Libya Montes]] (left) and [[Cydonia (region of Mars)|Cydonia]] (right, Mars)}}
The '''face''' is a central [[sense organ]] complex, normally on the ventral surface of the [[head]] for animals that have one. 

==Human face==
The front of [[human head]] is called the face and includes several distinct areas.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/face Face | Define Face at Dictionary.com]. Dictionary.reference.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-29.</ref> The main features are:
*The [[forehead]] is the [[human skin|skin]] beneath the [[hair]]line, bordered at the sides by  the [[temple (anatomy)|temple]]s and [[eyebrow]]s and [[ear]]s.
*The [[Human eye|eye]]s sit in an [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] and are protected by [[eyelid]]s, which are sometimes visible, and [[eyelashes]]. 
* The [[human nose]] [[Ethmoid bone|shape]] is distinctive as are its [[nostril]]s and [[Nasal septum|septum]].
*The [[cheek]]s cover the [[maxilla]] and [[mandibula|jaw]], the extremity of which is the [[chin]].
*The [[Human mouth|mouth]], with the upper [[lip]] divided by the  [[philtrum]], sometimes reveals the  [[tooth|teeth]], which form a distinct pattern.

Facial [[biometrics|appearance]] is vital for human [[Identity (philosophy)|recognition]] and [[communication]]. [[Facial muscles]] in humans allow [[facial expression|expression]] of [[emotion]]s. 

The face is itself a highly  [[sense|sensitive]] region of the human body and its expression  may change when the [[brain]] is stimulated by any of the five senses: [[Somatosensory system|touch]], [[temperature]] [[olfaction|smell]], [[taste]], [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], and [[visual perception|visual stimuli]].<ref>[http://www.face-and-emotion.com/dataface/anatomy/anatomy.jsp Anatomy of the Face and Head Underlying Facial Expression]. Face-and-emotion.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-29.</ref>

==Individuality and recognition==
The face is the feature which best distinguishes a [[person]]. Specialised regions of the [[human brain]], such as the [[fusiform face area]] (FFA), enable facial recognition; when these are [[prospagnosia|damaged]], it may be impossible to recognise faces even of intimate family members. The pattern of specific organs, such as the eyes, or of parts of them, is used in [[biometric identification]] to uniquely identify individuals.

==Metaphor==
By extension, anything which is the forward or world facing part of a system which has internal structure is considered its "face", like the [[façade]] of a building. For example a [[public relations]] or [[press officer]] might be called the "face" of the organization he or she represents. "Face" is also used metaphorically in a [[Face (sociological concept)|sociological context]] to refer to reputation or standing in society, particularly Chinese society,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ho, David Yau-fai |title=On the Concept of Face|journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=81 |issue=4 |month=January |year=1976 |pages=867&ndash;84|jstor=|doi=|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2777600}}: "The concept of face is, of course, Chinese in origin".</ref> and is spoken of as a resource which can be won or lost. Because of the association with individuality, the anonymous person is sometimes referred to as "faceless".

==Plastic surgery==
[[Cosmetic surgery]] can be used to alter the appearance of the facial features.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/plasticandcosmeticsurgery.html Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery: MedlinePlus]. Nlm.nih.gov. Retrieved on 2011-04-29.</ref> Plastic surgery may also be used in cases of [[facial trauma]], injury to the face. Severely disfigured individuals have recently received full [[face transplant]]s and partial transplants of skin and muscle tissue.

==Caricatures==
[[Caricature]]s often exaggerate facial features to make a face more easily recognised in association with a pronounced portion of the face of the individual in question—for example, a caricature of [[Osama bin Laden]] might focus on his facial hair and nose; a caricature of [[George W. Bush]] might enlarge his ears to the size of an elephant's; a caricature of [[Jay Leno]] may pronounce his head and chin; and a caricature of [[Mick Jagger]] might enlarge his lips. Exaggeration of memorable features helps people to recognise others when presented in a caricature form.<ref>[http://www.edu.dudley.gov.uk/art/specproj/caricatures/menu.htm information about caricatures]. Edu.dudley.gov.uk. Retrieved on 2011-04-29.</ref>

==Perception and recognition of faces==
[[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]] theorise that a face is not merely a set of facial features but is rather something meaningful in its form. This is consistent with the Gestalt theory that an image is seen in its entirety, not by its individual parts. According to Gary L. Allen, people adapted to respond more to faces during evolution as the natural result of being a social species. Allen suggests that the purpose of recognizing faces has its roots in the "parent-infant attraction, a quick and low-effort means by which parents and infants form an internal representation of each other, reducing the likelihood that the parent will abandon his or her offspring because of recognition failure".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Allen, Gary L. |title=Review: Seeking a Common Gestalt Approach to the Perception of Faces, Objects, and Scenes|journal= American Journal of Psychology |volume=119|issue=2|year=2006|pages=311–19|jstor=20445341|doi=10.2307/20445341|last2=Peterson|first2=Mary A.|last3=Rhodes|first3=Gillian}}</ref> Allen's work takes a psychological perspective that combines evolutionary theories with Gestalt psychology.

==Emotion==
[[File:Concrete smiley face.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A face in concrete: another example of [[pareidolia]]]]
Faces are essential to expressing [[emotion]], consciously or unconsciously. A frown denotes disapproval; a smile usually means someone is pleased. Being able to read emotion in another's face is "the fundamental basis for empathy and the ability to interpret a person’s reactions and predict the probability of ensuing behaviors". One study used the Multimodal Emotion Recognition Test<ref>[http://www.affective-sciences.org/MERT Multimodal Emotion Recognition Test (MERT) | Swiss Center for Affective Sciences]. Affective-sciences.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-29.</ref> to attempt to determine how to measure emotion. This research aimed at using a measuring device to accomplish what people do so easily everyday: read emotion in a face.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bänziger, T., Grandjean, D., & Scherer, K. R. |year=2009|title=Emotion recognition from expressions in face, voice, and body: The Multimodal Emotion Recognition Test (MERT)|journal= Emotion|volume= 9|issue=5|pages=691–704|doi=10.1037/a0017088|pmid=19803591}}</ref>

People are also relatively good at determining if a smile is real or fake. A recent study looked at individuals judging forced and genuine smiles. While young and elderly participants equally could tell the difference for smiling young people, the "older adult participants outperformed young adult participants in distinguishing between posed and spontaneous smiles".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Murphy, N. A., Lehrfeld, J. M., & Isaacowitz, D. M. |year=2010|title=Recognition of posed and spontaneous dynamic smiles in young and older adults|journal= Psychology and Aging|volume= 25|issue=4|pages=811–821|doi=10.1037/a0019888|pmid=20718538|pmc=3011054}}</ref> This suggests that with experience and age, we become more accurate at perceiving true emotions across various age groups.

==Biological perspective==
Research has indicated that certain areas of the brain respond particularly well to faces. The [[fusiform face area]], within the [[fusiform gyrus]], is activated by faces, and it is activated differently for shy and social people. A study confirmed that "when viewing images of strangers, shy adults exhibited significantly less activation in the fusiform gyri than did social adults".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Beaton, E. A., Schmidt, L. A., Schulkin, J., Antony, M. M., Swinson, R. P. & Hall, G. B.|year=2009|title=Different fusiform activity to stranger and personally familiar faces in shy and social adults|journal=Social Neuroscience|volume= 4|issue=4|pages=308–316|doi=10.1080/17470910902801021|pmid=19322727}}</ref> Furthermore, particular areas respond more to a face that is considered attractive, as seen in another study: "Facial beauty evokes a widely distributed neural network involving perceptual, decision-making and reward circuits. In those experiments, the perceptual response across FFA and LOC remained present even when subjects were not attending explicitly to facial beauty".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chatterjee, A., Thomas, A., Smith, S. E., & Aguirre, G. K. |year=2009|title= The neural response to facial attractiveness|journal= Neuropsychology|volume= 23|issue=2|pages=135–143|doi=10.1037/a0014430|pmid=19254086}}</ref>
