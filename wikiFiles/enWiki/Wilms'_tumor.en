[[Image:Wilms Tumor CTScan.OGG|thumb|right|thumbtime=3|[[Computed tomography|CT Scan]] of 11 cm '''Wilms' tumor''' of right kidney in 13-month-old patient.]]

'''Wilms' tumor''' or '''nephroblastoma''' is [[cancer]] of the [[kidney]]s that typically occurs in [[child]]ren, rarely in [[adult]]s.<ref>[http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/wilms-tumor EBSCO database] verified by [[URAC]]; accessed from [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York]]</ref>
Its common name is an [[eponym]], referring to Dr. [[Max Wilms]], the German surgeon (1867&ndash;1918) who first described this kind of tumor.<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2109.html WhoNamedIt.com: Max Wilms]</ref>

Approximately 500 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. annually. The majority (75%) occur in otherwise normal children; a minority (25%) are associated with other developmental abnormalities. It is highly responsive to treatment, with about 90% of patients surviving at least five years.

== Pathology ==
[[Image:Wilms tumour - low mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing the characteristic triphasic pattern consisting of tubules, solid sheets of small round cells, and stroma. [[H&E stain]].]]
[[Image:Wilms tumour - very high mag.jpg|thumb|High magnification micrograph showing the epithelial component (tubules). [[H&E stain]].]]

Most nephroblastomas are unilateral, being bilateral in less than 5% of cases, although patients with [[Denys-Drash syndrome]] mostly have bilateral or multiple tumors.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Guaragna |first=M. S. |last2=''et al.'' |year=2010 |title=The Novel WT1 Gene Mutation p. H377N Associated to Denys-Drash Syndrome |journal=Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=486–488 |doi=10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181e5e20d |pmid=20562648 |first2=Fernanda Caroline |last3=Assumpção |first3=Juliana Godoy |last4=Zambaldi |first4=Lílian de Jesus Girotto |last5=Cardinalli |first5=Izilda Aparecida |last6=Yunes |first6=José Andrés |last7=De Mello |first7=Maricilda Palandi |last8=Brandalise |first8=Silvia Regina |last9=Aguiar |first9=Simone dos Santos }}</ref> They tend to be encapsulated and vascularized tumors that do not cross the midline of the abdomen. In cases of metastasis it is usually to the lung. A rupture of Wilms' tumor puts the patient at risk of hemorrhage and peritoneal dissemination of the tumor. In such cases, surgical intervention by a surgeon who is experienced in the removal of such a fragile tumor is imperative.

Pathologically, a triphasic nephroblastoma comprises three elements:
* [[blastema]]
* [[mesenchyme]]
* [[epithelium]]

Wilms' tumor is a malignant tumor containing [[metanephric blastema]], stromal and epithelial derivatives. Characteristic is the presence of abortive tubules and glomeruli surrounded by a spindled cell stroma. The stroma may include striated [[muscle]], [[cartilage]], [[bone]], fat tissue, fibrous tissue. The tumor is compressing the normal kidney parenchyma.

The mesenchymal component may include cells showing [[rhabdomyoid differentiation]]. The rhabdomyoid component may itself show features of malignancy ([[rhabdomyosarcoma]]tous Wilms). 

Wilms' tumors may be separated into 2 prognostic groups based on pathologic characteristics:
* ''Favorable'' - Contains well developed components mentioned above
* ''[[Anaplastic]]'' - Contains diffuse anaplasia (poorly developed cells)

== Symptoms ==
Typical symptoms are:
*an abnormally large abdomen
*abdominal pain
*fever
*nausea and vomiting 
*blood in the urine (in about 20% of cases)
*high blood pressure in some cases

== Diagnosis ==
The first sign is normally a painless abdominal tumor that can be easily felt by the doctor. An Ultrasound, Computed Tomography, or MRI are done first. A tumor biopsy is not typically performed due to the chance of upstaging the cancer and seeding the abdomen with malignant cells.

==Prognosis==
The overall [[5-year survival]] is estimated to be approximately 90%,<ref>{{cite doi| 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1081}}, in turn citing {{cite pmid|11208843}}</ref> but for individuals the prognosis is highly dependent on individual [[#Staging and treatment|staging and treatment]]. Early removal tends to promote positive outcomes.

Tumor-specific loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) for chromosomes 1p and 16q identifies a subset of Wilms' tumor patients who have a significantly increased risk of relapse and death. LOH for these chromosomal regions can now be used as an independent prognostic factor together with disease stage to target intensity of treatment to risk of treatment failure.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Messahel |first=B. |last2=Williams |first2=R. |last3=Ridolfi |first3=A. |last4=''et al.'' |title=Allele loss at 16q defines poorer prognosis Wilms tumour irrespective of treatment approach in the UKW1-3 clinical trials: a Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) Study |journal=[[European Journal of Cancer|Eur J Cancer]] |year=2009 |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=819–826 |pmid=19231157 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2009.01.005 |first4=Roger |last5=Warren |first5=William |last6=Tinworth |first6=Lorna |last7=Hobson |first7=Rachel |last8=Al-Saadi |first8=Reem |last9=Whyman |first9=Gavin }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Grundy |first=P.

== Molecular biology ==
Mutations of  the [[WT1]] gene on chromosome 11 p 13 are observed in approximately 20% of Wilms' tumors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Call K, Glaser T, Ito C, Buckler A, Pelletier J, Haber D, Rose E, Kral A, Yeger H, Lewis W |title=Isolation and characterization of a zinc finger polypeptide gene at the human chromosome 11 Wilms' tumor locus |journal=Cell |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=509–20 |year=1990 |pmid=2154335 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(90)90601-A}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Huff V |title=Wilms tumor genetics |journal=Am J Med Genet |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=260–7 |year=1998 |pmid=9781905 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19981002)79:4<260::AID-AJMG6>3.0.CO;2-Q}}</ref> At least half of the Wilms' tumors with mutations in WT1 also carry mutations in [[CTNNB1]], the gene encoding the proto-oncogene [[beta-catenin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maiti S, Alam R, Amos CI, Huff V |title=Frequent association of beta-catenin and WT1 mutations in Wilms tumors |journal=Cancer Res |volume=60 |issue=22 |pages=6288–92 |year=2000 |pmid=11103785}}</ref>

A gene on the X chromosome, [[FAM123B|WTX]], is inactivated in up to 30% of Wilms' tumor cases, according to research published in 2007.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rivera M, Kim W, Wells J, Driscoll D, Brannigan B, Han M, Kim J, Feinberg A, Gerald W, Vargas S, Chin L, Iafrate A, Bell D, Haber D |title=An X chromosome gene, WTX, is commonly inactivated in Wilms tumor |journal=Science |volume=315 |issue=5812 |pages=642–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17204608 |doi=10.1126/science.1137509}}</ref>

Most cases do not have mutations in any of these genes.<ref name="pmid18311776">{{cite journal |author=Ruteshouser EC, Robinson SM, Huff V |title=Wilms tumor genetics: mutations in WT1, WTX, and CTNNB1 account for only about one-third of tumors |journal=Genes Chromosomes Cancer |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=461–70 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18311776 |doi=10.1002/gcc.20553}}</ref>

== Staging ==

Staging is determined by combination of imaging studies and pathology findings if the tumor is operable. Treatment strategy is determined by the stage:

===Definitions of stages===

====Stage I (43% of patients) ====
For stage I Wilms' tumor, 1 or more of the following criteria must be met: 
* Tumor is limited to the kidney and is completely excised.
* The surface of the renal capsule is intact.
* The tumor is not ruptured or biopsied (open or needle) prior to removal.
* No involvement of extrarenal or renal sinus lymph-vascular spaces
* No residual tumor apparent beyond the margins of excision.
* Metastasis of tumor to lymph nodes not identified.

====Stage II (23% of patients)====
For Stage II Wilms' tumor, 1 or more of the following criteria must be met: 
* Tumor extends beyond the kidney but is completely excised.
* No residual tumor apparent at or beyond the margins of excision.
* Any of the following conditions may also exist:
** Tumor involvement of the blood vessels of the renal sinus and/or outside the renal parenchyma.
** The tumor has been biopsied prior to removal or there is local spillage of tumor during surgery, confined to the flank.
** Extensive tumor involvement of renal sinus soft tissue.

====Stage III (23% of patients)====
For Stage III Wilms' tumor, 1 or more of the following criteria must be met: 
* Unresectable primary tumor.
* Lymph node metastasis.
* Tumor is present at surgical margins.
* Tumor spillage involving peritoneal surfaces either before or during surgery, or transected tumor thrombus.

====Stage IV (10% of patients) ====
Stage IV Wilms' tumor is defined as the presence of hematogenous metastases (lung, liver, bone, or brain), or lymph node metastases outside the abdomenopelvic region.

====Stage V (5% of patients) ====
Stage V Wilms’ tumor is defined as bilateral renal involvement at the time of initial diagnosis. 
Note: For patients with bilateral involvement, an attempt should be made to stage each side according to the above criteria (stage I to III) on the basis of extent of disease prior to biopsy.

===Prognosis and treatment===
Statistics may sometimes show more favorable outcomes for more aggressive stages than for less ones, which may be caused by more aggressive treatment and/or [[random variability]] in the study groups. Also, a stage V tumor is not necessarily worse than a stage IV tumor.
