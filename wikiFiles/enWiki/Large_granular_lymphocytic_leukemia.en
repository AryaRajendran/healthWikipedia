'''Large granular lymphocytic leukemia''' is a disease that exhibits an unexplained, chronic (> 6 months) elevation in large granular [[lymphocytes]] (LGLs) in the peripheral [[blood]].<ref name="who1">{{cite book |author=Elaine Sarkin Jaffe, Nancy Lee Harris, World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Harald Stein, J.W.

It is sometimes known as ''T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia'' (specifying involvement of the [[T cell]]s). However, ''NK large granular lymphocyte leukemia'' (involving [[natural killer cell]]s) is also possible.<ref name="pmid18791165">{{cite journal |author=Epling-Burnette PK, Sokol L, Chen X, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical improvement by farnesyltransferase inhibition in NK large granular lymphocyte leukemia associated with imbalanced NK receptor signaling |journal=Blood |volume=112 |issue=12 |pages=4694–8 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18791165 |doi=10.1182/blood-2008-02-136382 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18791165 |pmc=2597136}}</ref>

It is also known by the following terms: ''proliferation of large granular lymphocytes'' (LGLs), ''LGL leukemia'', ''Tγ-lymphoproliferative disorder'', and, in common with other T cell leukemias such as [[T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia]], ''T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia''.<ref name="who1" />

==Epidemiology==
T-LGL is a rare form of [[leukemia]], comprising 2-3% of all cases of [[small lymphocytic leukemias]].<ref name="who1"/> 

==Etiology==
The postulated cells of origin are a transformed CD8+ [[T-cell]] with clonal rearrangements of β chain [[T-cell receptor]] genes for the majority of cases and a CD8- [[T-cell]] with clonal rearrangements of γ chain [[T-cell receptor]] genes for a minority of cases.<ref name="who1"/>

==Clinical features==
===Clinical presentation===
This disease is known for an indolent clinical course and incidental discovery.<ref name="who1"/> The most common physical finding is moderate [[splenomegaly]]. [[B symptoms]] are seen in a third of cases, and recurrent [[infections]] due to the associated neutropenia are seen in almost half of cases.<ref name="lam2">{{cite journal |author=Lamy T, Loughran TP |title=Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia |journal=Cancer Control |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=25–33 |year=1998 |month=January |pmid=10761014 |doi= |url=http://www.moffitt.usf.edu/pubs/ccj/v5n1/article3.html}}</ref><ref name="cha1">{{cite journal |author=Chan WC, Link S, Mawle A, Check I, Brynes RK, Winton EF |title=Heterogeneity of large granular lymphocyte proliferations: delineation of two major subtypes |journal=Blood |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=1142–53 |year=1986 |month=November |pmid=3490288 |doi= |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3490288}}</ref><ref name="pan1">{{cite journal |author=Pandolfi F, Loughran TP, Starkebaum G, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical course and prognosis of the lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes.

===Laboratory findings===
The requisite [[lymphocytosis]] of this disease is typically 2-20x10<sup>9</sup>/L.<ref name="kwo1"/> 

Immunoglobulin derangements including hypergammaglobulinemia, autoantibodies, and circulating immune complexes are commonly seen.<ref name="lam1"/><ref name="osh1">{{cite journal |author=Oshimi K, Yamada O, Kaneko T, ''et al.'' |title=Laboratory findings and clinical courses of 33 patients with granular lymphocyte-proliferative disorders |journal=Leukemia |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=782–8 |year=1993 |month=June |pmid=8388971 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="lou1">{{cite journal |author=Loughran TP, Starkebaum G, Aprile JA |title=Rearrangement and expression of T-cell receptor genes in large granular lymphocyte leukemia |journal=Blood |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=822–4 |year=1988 |month=March |pmid=3345349 |doi= |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3345349}}</ref><ref name="lou2">{{cite journal |author=Loughran TP, Kadin ME, Starkebaum G, ''et al.'' |title=Leukemia of large granular lymphocytes: association with clonal chromosomal abnormalities and autoimmune neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia |journal=Ann.

===Sites of involvement===
The leukemic cells of T-LGL can be found in peripheral [[blood]], [[bone marrow]], [[spleen]], and [[liver]]. Nodal involvement is rare.<ref name="who1"/><ref name="lam2"/>

===Prognosis===
The 5 year survival has been noted as 89% in at least one study from France of 201 patients with T-LGL leukemia.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2930955|title=Analysis of a French cohort of patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia: A report on 229 cases|year=2010|volume=95|issue=9|pmid=20378561|last1=Bareau|first1=B|last2=Rey|first2=J|last3=Hamidou|first3=M|last4=Donadieu|first4=J|last5=Morcet|first5=J|last6=Reman|first6=O|last7=Schleinitz|first7=N|last8=Tournilhac|first8=O|last9=Roussel|first9=M|pages=1534–41|doi=10.3324/haematol.2009.018481|journal=Haematologica}}</ref>

==Morphology==
===Peripheral blood===
The neoplastic lymphocytes seen in this disease are large in size with azurophilic granules that contains proteins involved in cell lysis such as [[perforin]] and [[granzyme B]].<ref name="sem1">{{cite journal |author=Semenzato G, Zambello R, Starkebaum G, Oshimi K, Loughran TP |title=The lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes: updated criteria for diagnosis |journal=Blood |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=256–60 |year=1997 |month=January |pmid=8978299 |doi= |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8978299}}</ref>

===Bone marrow===
[[Bone marrow]] involvement in this disease is often present, but to a variable extent. The lymphocytic infiltrate is usually [[interstitial fluid|interstitial]], but a [[Nodule (medicine)|nodular]] pattern rarely occurs.<ref name="who1"/> 

==Molecular Findings==
===Immunophenotype===
The neoplastic cells of this disease display a mature [[T-cell]] [[immunophenotype]], with the majority of cases showing a [[CD4]]-/[[CD8]]+ T-cell subset [[immunophenotype]] versus other permutations of those markers.<ref name="cha1"/><ref name="pan1"/> Variable expression of [[CD11b]], [[CD56]], and [[CD57]]<ref name="lam1"/> are observed. Immunohistochemistry for [[perforin]], [[TIA-1]], and [[granzyme B]] are usually positive.<ref name="who1"/>

===Genetic findings===
Clonal rearrangements of the [[T-cell receptor]] (TCR) genes are a necessary condition for the diagnosis of this disease. The gene for the β chain of the TCR is found to be rearranged more often than the γ chain. of the TCR.<ref name="lou1"/><ref name="vie1">{{cite journal |author=Vie H, Chevalier S, Garand R, ''et al.'' |title=Clonal expansion of lymphocytes bearing the gamma delta T-cell receptor in a patient with large granular lymphocyte disorder |journal=Blood |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=285–90 |year=1989 |month=July |pmid=2546620 |doi= |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2546620}}</ref>

[[Alemtuzumab]] has been investigated for use in treatment of refractory T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia.<ref name="pmid14976065">{{cite journal |author=Rosenblum MD, LaBelle JL, Chang CC, Margolis DA, Schauer DW, Vesole DH |title=Efficacy of alemtuzumab treatment for refractory T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia |journal=Blood |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages=1969–71 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=14976065 |doi=10.1182/blood-2003-11-3951 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14976065}}</ref>
