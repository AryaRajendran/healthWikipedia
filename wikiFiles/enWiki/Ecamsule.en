'''Ecamsule''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[trade name]] '''Mexoryl SX''', [[INCI]] terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid) is an [[organic compound]] which is added to many [[sunscreen]]s to filter out [[Ultraviolet|UVA]] rays. It is a benzylidene camphor derivative, many of which are known for their excellent photostability.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Photostability assessment of sunscreens. Benzylidene camphor and dibenzoylmethane derivatives| year=1988| month=April| author=Deflandre A, Lang G| journal=Int J Cosmet Sci| volume=10| pages=53–62| doi=10.1111/j.1467-2494.1988.tb00002.x| pmid=19456910| issue=2}}</ref>

Although there are a few different UV absorbers with the trade name Mexoryl, only two of them are widely used where approved. Mexoryl SX (water soluble) and Mexoryl XL (INCI [[Drometrizole trisiloxane]], oil soluble). Together they show a [[Synergy|synergistic]] effect in protection.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Prevention of ultraviolet-induced skin pigmentation| year=2004| month=October| pmid=15379874| author=Moyal D.| journal=Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed| volume=20| pages=243–7| issue=5| doi=10.1111/j.1600-0781.2004.00111.x}}</ref> The patents are held by [[L'Oréal]]. Sunscreens containing ecamsule are exclusive to L'Oréal and its brands.

==Mode of action==
Exposed to UV, ecamsule undergoes reversible [[photoisomerization]], followed by [[photoexcitation]]. The absorbed UV is then released as thermal energy, without penetrating the skin.

[[UVB]] rays cause short-term sunburn and skin cancer; [[Ultraviolet|UVA]] rays cause wrinkling and may have some role in development of skin cancer. There is no official rating for UVA protection in the US. In Europe, there are several different rating systems that are used to measure effectiveness in blocking UVA rays, including the IPD (immediate pigment darkening assay) and the PPD (persistent pigment darkening assay). The UVB range is 280 to 320 nanometers, and the UVA range is 320 to 400. Ecamsule protects against UV wavelengths in the 290–400 nanometer range, with peak protection at 345&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite journal| title=In vivo evaluation of photoprotection against chronic ultraviolet-A irradiation by a new sunscreen Mexoryl SX.| year=1992| month=April| pmid=1320278| author=Fourtanier A, Labat-Robert J, Kern P, Berrebi C, Gracia AM, Boyer B.| journal=Photochem Photobiol| volume=55| pages=549–60| doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.1992.tb04277.x| issue=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=Mexoryl SX: a broad absorption UVA filter protects human skin from the effects of repeated suberythemal doses of UVA.| year=1998| month=June| pmid=9745729| author=Seite S, Moyal D, Richard S, de Rigal J, Leveque JL, Hourseau C, Fourtanier A.| journal=J Photochem Photobiol B.| volume=44| pages=69–76| doi=10.1016/S1011-1344(98)00122-5| issue=1}}</ref> Since ecamsule doesn't cover the entire UV spectrum, it should be combined with other active sunscreen agents to ensure broad-spectrum UV protection. Ecamsule is a photostable organic UVA absorber, meaning it doesn't degrade significantly when exposed to light. This is in contrast to the widely used UVA absorber [[avobenzone]] that is not intrinsically photostable and requires photostabilizers to prevent significant degradation in light.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Photostabilization of Butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone) and Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate by Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), a new UV broadband filter| year=2001| month=September| pmid=11594052| author=Chatelain E, Gabard B.| journal=Photochem Photobiol| volume=74| pages=401–6| doi=10.1562/0031-8655(2001)074<0401:POBMAA>2.0.CO;2| issue=3}}</ref><ref>[[Image:Free text.png]] {{cite journal| title=Changes in ultraviolet absorption of sunscreens after ultraviolet irradiation| year=1999| url=http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v113/n4/full/5603262a.html|month=October| pmid=10504439| author=Tarras-Wahlberg N, Stenhagen G, Larko O, Rosen A, Wennberg AM, Wennerstrom O| journal=J Invest Dermatol| volume=113| pages=547–53| doi=10.1046/j.1523-1747.1999.00721.x| issue=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=A new long-chain UV absorber derived from 4-tert-butyl-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethane: absorbance stability under solar irradiation| year=2005| month=Mar-Apr| pmid=15870853| author=Wetz F, Routaboul C, Denis A, Rico-Lattes I| journal=J Cosmet Sci| volume=56| pages=135–48| issue=2}}</ref>

==Efficacy==
A 5% ecamsule containing sunscreen can prevent early changes leading to photoaging in humans. A broad spectrum sunscreen with ecamsule, avobenzone and [[octocrylene]] significantly reduces the skin damage associated with UV exposure in human subjects.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1034/j.1600-0781.2000.160401.x| title=A full-UV spectrum absorbing daily use cream protects human skin against biological changes occurring in photoaging| year=2000| month=August| pmid=11019938| author=Seité S, Colige A, Piquemal-Vivenot P, Montastier C, Fourtanier A, Lapière C, Nusgens B| journal= Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed| volume=16| pages=147–55| issue=4}}</ref>

In studies done in mice it reduces the formation of UV induced [[pyrimidine dimers]] and delays the onset of skin cancer. [[In vitro]] ecamsule effectively protects against the harmful effects of UV.<ref>{{cite journal| title=An in vitro strategy to evaluate the phototoxicity of solar UV at the molecular and cellular level: application to photoprotection assessment| year=1998| month=September| pmid=9729050| author=Marrot L, Belaidi JP, Chaubo C, Meunier JR, Perez P, Agapakis-Causse C| journal= Eur J Dermatol| volume=8| pages=403–12| issue=6}}</ref>

==Safety==
Ecamsule has little percutaneous absorption and little systemic effects, therefore it is considered relatively safe.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Percutaneous absorption of Mexoryl SX in human volunteers: comparison with in vitro data| year=2003| month=Nov-Dec| pmid=14528058| author=Benech-Kieffer F, Meuling WJ, Leclerc C, Roza L, Leclaire J, Nohynek G| journal= Skin Pharmacol Appl Skin Physiol| volume=16| pages=343–55| doi=10.1159/000072929| issue=6}}</ref> 
A mouse study shows that it does not increase the probability of promoting skin cancer.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Mexoryl SX protects against solar-simulated UVR-induced photocarcinogenesis in mice| year=1996| month=October| pmid=8863475| author=Fourtanier A| journal= Photochem Photobiol| volume=64| pages=688–93| doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.1996.tb03125.x| issue=4}}</ref> Studies done in vitro show that it is not photomutagenic.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Development of assays for the detection of photomutagenicity of chemicals during exposure to UV light.

Because ecamsule is an [[acid]] it needs to be neutralized in order to be used without offsetting the final [[pH]] of the sunscreen too much. Usually this is done with [[triethanolamine]].

==Availability==
L'Oréal patented ecamsule first in 1982. It was approved in the EU in 1991. Sunscreens based on ecamsule have been available in Europe, Canada and other parts of the world since 1993. Ecamsule was given approval by the FDA in 2006 to be used in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web | title=Long-awaited sunscreen approved for sale in U.S.| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-07-24-sunscreen_x.htm?csp=34 | date=2006-07-24| publisher=USA Today| volume=| pages=}}</ref> However this approval only extends to ecamsule containing sunscreens registered under a [[New Drug Application]], not ecamsule itself.<ref>[http://www.cosmeticsdesign.com/news/ng.asp?id=69386-l-oreal-mexoryl-sunscreen-uva FDA approves Mexoryl in L'Oreal sunscreen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/articles/4539726.html C&T.com | Articles | Regulatory Review: Sunscreens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
