'''Hyperfocus''' is an intense form of [[mind|mental]] [[attention|concentration]] or [[creative visualization|visualization]] that focuses [[consciousness]] on a narrow subject, separate from objective [[reality]] and onto subjective [[mental planes]], [[daydream]]s, [[concept]]s, [[fiction]], the [[imagination]], and other [[object of the mind|objects of the mind]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} It may bear a relationship to the concept of [[Flow (psychology)|flow]].<ref name="webb">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NQrtt-peg5AC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&source=bl&ots=SgPrxTreVn&sig=sgz-SD-J9BGaK6NFyq4ZTkmMNUw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=J-xRUIOtDrLI0AXIpYHQCA&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&f=false  Misdiagnosis And Dual Diagnoses Of Gifted Children And Adults: Adhd, Bipolar...] - Webb, p.50-51]: Notes prior research into "hyperfocus" in ADHD, identifies it with "flow" in gifted children, observes that what is called hyperfocus in such cases "seems to be a less medical-sounding description of perseveration. Thus the apparent ability to concentrate in certain limited situations does not exclude the diagnosis of ADD/ADHD."</ref>

Hyperfocus may in some cases also be evidence, or symptomatic, of a [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] condition, where it is more commonly and accurately<ref name="webb" /> described as [[perseveration]] (or perseverance) - the inability to, or impairment in, switching tasks or activities ("[[set shifting]]"),<ref name="priory">[http://priory.com/gloss.htm#perseveration Priory psychiatric glossary]</ref> or desisting from mental or physical response repetition (gestures, words, thoughts) despite absence or cessation of a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]],<ref name="Dict Bio Psych">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UbL2MZ9xI7oC&pg=PA595&lpg=PA595&source=bl&ots=b09V9gEKCM&sig=86fdTY5t_S077K7l3gtYZJxP2yo&hl=en#v=onepage&f=false Dictionary of Biological Psychology] - p.595</ref><ref name="Helm-Estabrooks">{{vcite journal |author=Helm-Estabrooks N |title=The problem of perseveration |journal=Semin Speech Lang |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=289–90 |year=2004 |pmid=15599818 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-837241 |url=http://www.thieme-connect.com/ejournals/html/ssl/doi/10.1055/s-2004-837241 }}</ref><ref name="PC def">[http://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/2008/perseveration/ Psych Central definition]</ref><ref name="Di def">[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/perseveration Dictionary.com definition]</ref> and which is not excessive in terms of quantity but are apparently both functionless and involve a narrow range of behaviours, and are not better described as [[stereotypy]] (a highly repetitive [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] behaviour).

Conditions associated with perseveration include 
* Neurological conditions, in particular some kinds of [[autism]] and [[ADHD]] - the [[autism spectrum]] (especially [[Asperger syndrome]]), and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD)&ndash;in the latter it is informally but probably incorrectly called "hyperfocus"<ref name="webb" /> and may be a coping mechanism or symptom of self-regulation impairment&ndash;as well as [[twice exceptional|people who are both intellectually gifted and suffer a learning disability]] who may have either or both of hyperfocus and perseverative behaviours.<ref name="webb" />  Other conditions involving dysfunction or disregulation within the frontal lobe could also theoretically have similar effects.
* Conditions unlikely to be confused with hyperfocus - clinical conditions involving clear repetition of words or behaviours, such as [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD) or [[PTSD|trauma]];<ref name="differential">[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Differential Diagnoses] - 2012</ref> and cases of physical brain injury, trauma or damage, such as [[traumatic brain injuries|traumatic brain injury]] and [[frontal lobe]] [[lesion]]s;<ref name="priory" />
