St George's has its origins in 1733, and was the second institution in England to provide formal training courses for doctors (after the [[University of Oxford]]).<ref>[http://www.sgul.ac.uk/about/history.cfm ]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> St George's affiliated with the University of London soon after the latter's establishment in 1836.<ref>''The University of London 1836-1986'' by Negley Harte (1986), p.96</ref> As of 2008 St George's medical school accepted around 100 graduates, 175 undergraduates and 10 students from overseas making it one of the largest medical schools in the UK.<ref name="statistics">{{cite web|url=http://www.study-medicine.co.uk/index.php?pageid=stats|title=www.study-medicine.co.uk British Medical School Statistics|publisher=Study-medicine.co.uk|accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref> St George's is closely affiliated to [[St George's Hospital]] and is one of the [[United Hospitals]].

==History==
[[File:Shotter Boys Hyde Park Corner, 1842 edited.jpg|upright|thumb|250px|right|[[Hyde Park Corner]] in 1842]]

Originally set up in 1733 next to [[Hyde Park Corner]] (now the site of [[The Lanesborough]] hotel), in central [[London]], the college was transferred to its current site, [[Tooting]] in [[South London]] in 1980, where it shares a site with [[St George's Healthcare NHS Trust]]. Following [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|Quality Assurance Agency]] inspections St George's gained a score of 23 out of 24 for its teaching of medicine <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/subjectLevel/q170_00.pdf |title=q170.qxd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref> — the highest of any of the London medical schools and, by academic teaching standards, the best medical school in London. The inspections report was published in January 2000 and the course, curriculum and teaching methods at St George's have changed since then. 

In recent years, St George's has expanded beyond its medical schools roots. Alongside its medical course it now runs a Biomedical Sciences course, which has expanded to meet demand in the last 5 years from an initial intake of 30, to 150 students. There are now more places for Undergraduate Biomedical Science students than 5-Year Medical students.

In partnership with [[Kingston University]], The Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences has moved St George's into other areas. Amongst these are Nursing, Physiotherapy, Paramedic Science and Radiography. The Faculty has been congratulated{{Who|date=March 2010}} for its high teaching standards, employment rates and cutting edge research in the social sciences.

St George's was also the first institution in the United Kingdom to offer a four year graduate entry medicine degree based on the program from [[Flinders University]]<ref>[http://www.sgul.ac.uk/dms/F896B7649D5E98A6A8F40DF4D361D38B.doc ]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> with which it has an exchange program. The first intake was in 2000 with 35 students and the course has since been emulated by many other universities. Entry to the course is highly competitive with candidates being required to sit the [[GAMSAT]] as part of the application process.

Most recently St George's, along with other London medical schools, has been the setting for new television drama [[Vital Signs (TV series)|Vital Signs]].

In 2008, St George's announced that it planned to merge with [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]] to form a single institution within the University of London.<ref>[https://portal.sgul.ac.uk/services/news/st-georges-council-decision-on-merger/ St George's Council decision on merger] - SGUL</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/oct/01/universitymergers.highereducation| title=London universities merge| publisher=The Guardian | date =2008-10-01 | first=Anthea | last=Lipsett | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> The merger was called off in a joint statement by the two colleges' principals on 25 September 2009.<ref>Joint statement from St George's and Royal Holloway, University of London 25/9/09 [http://www.sgul.ac.uk/media/latest-news/joint-statement-from-st-george2019s-university-of-london-and-royal-holloway-university-of-london]</ref><ref>RHSG St George's, University of London and Royal Holloway joint statement 25/9/09 [http://www.rhsg.org.uk]</ref> St George's intends to keep working with Royal Holloway in the field of health and social care along with its well-established Joint Faculty with Kingston University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Prospective-Students/merger.html |title=RHUL website 25/9/09 |publisher=Rhul.ac.uk |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref> St George's, Kingston University and Royal Holloway will continue to collaborate in the field of health and social care as part of the existing SWan (South West London Academic Network) healthcare alliance.<ref>R.

During the 2011/2012 academic year, it was announced that current students had the option of graduating with either a University of London degree or a St George's Hospital Medical School one. Future students would automatically receive the latter.

==Campus==

St George's, in partnership with INTO University Partners, has also formed a joint venture, INTO SGUL, to offer a Foundation in Medical, Biomedical and Health Sciences for international students whose qualifications do not allow direct progression into Bachelors level study in the UK, and a six-year MBBS and a four-year graduate stream MBBS programme specifically for international students, with clinical placements overseas.  The first student cohort on each international MBBS programme entered St George's in September 2012.<ref>http://www.sgul.ac.uk/international/into</ref>

Outside of the UK, the MBBS4 is also offered in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]] through a partnership between St George's and the [[University of Nicosia]].  The new programme was inaugurated and the first student cohort commenced in Nicosia in September 2011.  The programme at the University of Nicosia features international clinical placements in Israel and the USA.<ref>http://www.nicosia.sgul.ac.cy/</ref> 

St George's offers numerous research and taught postgraduate degrees.<ref name=guardprof/>

==Student life==

The Students' Union organises various activities including fancy dress discos and a [[Rag Week]], the annual series of fund-raising events, which in the year 2007-2008 raised around £80,000 for various charities including Cancer Research, Barnardos and Leonard Cheshire. Year on year St George's raises more money for charity per capita than any other London medical school.  In recent years the Union has become more politically aware and shown greater interest in [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] and [[British Medical Association]] activities.

Each new student at St George's is assigned a 'mum' or 'dad' in the year above. These 'parents' act as mentors for the new students, giving them advice about the course, often tutoring them when needed, as well as buying them drinks during Freshers' Week and beyond. Over the years the family expands to include siblings, uncles, aunts, grandparents etc., spanning all the years of the various courses.

St George's enters a team into the British television quiz programme [[University Challenge]] each year.

===Sports===
[[St. George’s Hospital Medical School RFC]] is one of the oldest rugby clubs in the world having been founded in 1863. St George's also has a number of other sports clubs including swimming, rowing, cheerleading, volleyball, football, netball, hockey and many others and participates in various competitions. As [[St George's Hospital|St George's]] is a member of the [[United Hospitals]], the teams also compete in separate competitions with the five other medical schools within the [[University of London]] and that of [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]].
