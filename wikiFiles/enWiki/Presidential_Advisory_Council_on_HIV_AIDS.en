== Criticism ==
Critics have said they lack confidence in PACHA and note that the Council as reorganized under [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] held only two meetings in 2002 and issued only five recommendations to the White House. By comparison, the [[President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic]] (Watkins Commission) submitted 597 recommendations to the [[Reagan Administration]].

The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] released a report in February 2004 entitled [[Scientific Integrity in Policymaking]] that said that [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] intentionally appointed under-qualified individuals to PACHA as part of a broader effort to manipulate the government's scientific advisory system by providing the appearance of expert advice while controlling the advice given.

Critics pointed to the appointment of Dr. Joseph McIlhaney, a Texas-based doctor known for rejecting the use of condoms to prevent the spread of [[HIV]] and other [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and for his advocacy of [[abstinence]]-only programs despite negligible evidence that they reduce pregnancy rates among young people.
