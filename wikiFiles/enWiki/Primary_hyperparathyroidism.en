'''Primary hyperparathyroidism''' causes [[hypercalcemia]] (elevated blood calcium levels) through the excessive secretion of [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH), usually by an [[adenoma]] (benign tumors) of the [[parathyroid gland]]s.

==Epidemiology==
The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of primary hyperparathyroidism is approximately 1 per 1,000 people (0.1%),<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.rcsed.ac.uk/journal/vol43_6/4360019.htm |first=R.

==Signs and Symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism are those of hypercalcemia.  They are classically summarized by the mnemonic "stones, bones, abdominal groans and psychiatric moans".
* "Stones" refers to [[kidney stones]], [[nephrocalcinosis]], and [[diabetes insipidus]] (polyuria and polydipsia).  These can ultimately lead to [[renal failure]].
* "Bones" refers to bone-related complications. The classic bone disease in hyperparathyroidism is [[osteitis fibrosa cystica]], which results in pain and sometimes pathological fractures.  Other bone diseases associated with hyperparathyroidism are [[osteoporosis]], [[osteomalacia]], and [[arthritis]].
* "Abdominal groans" refers to gastrointestinal symptoms of [[constipation]], [[indigestion]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].  Hypercalcemia can lead to [[peptic ulcers]] and [[acute pancreatitis]]. The peptic ulcers can be an effect of increased [[gastric acid]] secretion by [[hypercalcemia]],<ref>{{cite pmid|6024167}}</ref> but may also be part of a [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1]] syndrome of both hyperparathyroid neoplasia and a [[gastrinoma]].
* "Psychiatric moans" refers to effects on the [[central nervous system]].  Symptoms include lethargy, fatigue, depression, memory loss, psychosis, ataxia, delirium, and coma.
* [[Left ventricular hypertrophy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stefenelli T, Abela C, Frank H, ''et al.'' |title=Cardiac abnormalities in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism: implications for follow-up |journal=J.

* Increased all-cause mortality<ref name="Vestergaard2003">{{cite journal |last=Vestergaard |first=P. |last2=Mosekilde |first2=L. |journal=[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]] |title=Cohort study on effects of parathyroid surgery on multiple outcomes in primary hyperparathyroidism |year=2003 |volume=327 |issue=7414 |pages=530–534 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7414.530 |pmc=192894 |pmid=12958111 }}</ref>

The German description of the same symptoms is "{{lang|de|Stein-, Bein- und Magenpein}}", literally "stone, bone, and stomach-pain".

Other signs include proximal muscle weakness, itching, and [[band keratopathy]] of the eyes.

When subjected to formal research, symptoms of depression, pain, and gastric dysfunction seem to correlate with mild cases of hypercalcemia.<ref name="pmid21723154">{{cite journal| author=Bargren AE, Repplinger D, Chen H, Sippel RS| title=Can biochemical abnormalities predict symptomatology in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism? | journal=J Am Coll Surg | year= 2011 | volume= 213 | issue= 3 | pages= 410–4 | pmid=21723154 | doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2011.06.401 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=21723154  }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is made by blood tests. 

Serum calcium levels are elevated, and the parathyroid hormone level is abnormally high compared with an expected low level in response to the high calcium. A relatively elevated parathyroid hormone has been estimated to have a [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of 60%-80% and a [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of approximately 90% for primary hyperparathyroidism.<ref>[http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/34/12/2439.pdf] {{cite pmid|3058363}}</ref>

A more powerful variant of comparing the balance between calcium and parathyroid hormone is to perform a 3 hour calcium infusion. After infusion, a parathyroid hormone level above a [[cutoff (reference value)|cutoff]] of 14&nbsp;ng/l has a [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of 100% and a [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of 93% in detecting primary hyperparathyroidism, with a [[confidence interval]] of 80% to 100%.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1530/EJE-07-0132}}</ref>

The serum chloride/phosphate ratio is 33 or more in most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. However, usage of [[thiazide]] medications have been reported to causes ratios above 33.<ref name="pmid6848626">{{cite journal |author=Lawler FH, Janssen HP |title=Chloride:phosphate ratio with hypercalcemia secondary to thiazide administration |journal=The Journal of family practice |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=153–4 |year=1983 |pmid=6848626 |doi=}}</ref> Studies without any usage of thiazide diuretics have estimated a serum chloride/phosphate ratio to have a [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 94%<ref name="pmid1155729">{{cite journal |author=Reeves CD, Palmer F, Bacchus H, Longerbeam JK |title=Differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia by the chloride/phosphate ratio |journal=Am.

Urinary [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] is occasionally measured; this is generally elevated..

===Parathyroid hormone activity===
Intact PTH levels are also elevated.

==Causes==
The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a sporadic, single [[parathyroid adenoma]]<ref name="urlEndocrine Pathology">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/ENDOHTML/ENDO044.html |title=Endocrine Pathology |work= |accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref> resulting from a clonal mutation (~97%).  Less common are [[parathyroid hyperplasia]]<ref name="urlEndocrine Pathology">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/ENDOHTML/ENDO043.html |title=Endocrine Pathology |work= |accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref> (~2.5%), [[parathyroid carcinoma]] (malignant tumor), and adenomas in more than one gland (together ~0.5%).

Primary hyperparathyroidism is also a feature of several familial endocrine disorders:  [[Multiple endocrine neoplasia]] type 1 and type 2A ([[Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1|MEN type 1]] and [[Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2|MEN type 2A]]), and [[familial hyperparathyroidism]].

In all cases, the disease is [[idiopathic]], but is thought to involve inactivation of [[tumor suppressor gene]]s ([[Menin]] gene in MEN1), or involve gain of function mutations ([[RET proto-oncogene]] MEN 2a).

Recently, it was demonstrated that [[Liquidator (Chernobyl)|liquidator]]s of the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] power plant are faced with a substantial risk of primary hyperparathyroidism, possibly caused by radioactive [[strontium]] [[isotope]]s.<ref name=BoehmNEJM>{{cite journal|last=Boehm|first=Bernhard O.|coauthors=Rosinger, Silke, Belyi, David, Dietrich, Johannes W.|title=The Parathyroid as a Target for Radiation Damage|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=2011|month=08|volume=365|issue=7|pages=676–678|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1104982|pmid=21848480|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1104982|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>

Primary hyperparathyroidism can also result from [[pregnancy]]. It is apparently very rare, with only about 110 cases have so far been reported in world literature, but this is probably a considerable underestimate of its actual prevalence in pregnant women.<ref>[http://www.obgyn.net/pelvic-pain/pelvic-pain.asp Primary Hyperparathyroidism in Pregnancy - a review] at obgyn.net. By Sushanta Bhadra and John Fairbank. Retrieved April 2011</ref>

==Complications==
The classic bone disease in hyperparathyroidism is [[osteitis fibrosa cystica]], which results in pain and sometimes pathological fractures.  Other bone diseases associated with hyperparathyroidism are [[osteoporosis]], [[osteomalacia]], and [[arthritis]].

==Treatment==
Treatment is usually surgical removal of the gland(s) containing adenomas.

===Medications===
Medications include estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women and [[bisphosphonate]]s. [[Bisphosphonate]]s may improve bone turnover.<ref name="pmid15240609">{{cite journal |author=Khan AA, Bilezikian JP, Kung AW, ''et al.'' |title=Alendronate in primary hyperparathyroidism: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=89 |issue=7 |pages=3319–25 |year=2004 |pmid=15240609 |doi=10.1210/jc.2003-030908}}</ref>
Newer medications termed "calcimimetics" used in secondary hyperparathyroidism are now being used in Primary hyperparathyroidism. Calcimimetics reduce the amount of parathyroid hormone released by the parathyroid glands. They are recommended in patients in whom surgery is inappropriate.<ref>http://pi.amgen.com/united_states/sensipar/sensipar_pi_hcp_english.pdf</ref>

===Surgery===
The symptoms of the disease, listed above, are indications for surgery. Surgery reduces all cause mortality as well as resolving symptoms. However, cardiovascular mortality is not significantly reduced.<ref name="Vestergaard2003" />

A consensus statement in 2002 recommended the following indications for surgery in asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism:<ref name="pmid12466320">{{cite journal |author=Bilezikian JP, Potts JT, Fuleihan Gel-H, ''et al.'' |title=Summary statement from a workshop on asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: a perspective for the 21st century |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=87 |issue=12 |pages=5353–61 |year=2002 |pmid=12466320 |doi=10.1210/jc.2002-021370}}</ref>
* Serum calcium: 1.0&nbsp;mg/dl above upper limit of normal
* 24-h urinary calcium >400&nbsp;mg
* Creatinine clearance reduced by 30% compared with age-matched subjects.
* Bone mineral density t-score <&minus;2.5 at any site
* Age <50

More recently, three [[randomized controlled trial]]s have studied the role of surgery in patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. The largest study reported that surgery showed increase in bone mass, but no improvement in quality of life after one to two years among patients with:<ref name="pmid17284629">{{cite journal |author=Bollerslev J, Jansson S, Mollerup CL, ''et al.'' |title=Medical observation, compared with parathyroidectomy, for asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: a prospective, randomized trial |journal=J.

* Untreated, asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism
* Serum calcium between 2.60&ndash;2.85&nbsp;mmol/liter (10.4&ndash;11.4&nbsp;mg/dl)
* Age between 50 and 80 yr
* No medications interfering with Ca metabolism
* No hyperparathyroid bone disease
* No previous operation in the neck
* Creatinine level < 130 µmol/liter (<1.47&nbsp;mg/dl)

Two other [[randomized controlled trial|trials]] reported improvements in bone density and some improvement in quality of life with surgery.<ref name="pmid17535997">{{cite journal |author=Ambrogini E, Cetani F, Cianferotti L, ''et al.'' |title=Surgery or surveillance for mild asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: a prospective, randomized clinical trial |journal=J.

===Future therapies===
Future developments such as calcimimetic agents (e.g. [[cinacalcet]]) which activate the parathyroid [[calcium-sensing receptor]] may offer a good alternative to surgery.
