'''Measles''' (also known as Rubeola [not to be confused with [[rubella]]], morbilli, or English measles) is an infection of the respiratory system caused by a [[virus]], specifically a [[paramyxovirus]] of the genus ''[[Morbillivirus]]''.  Morbilliviruses, like other paramyxoviruses, are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses.  Symptoms include  [[fever]], [[cough]], [[coryza|runny nose]], [[conjunctivitis|red eyes]] and a generalized, [[maculopapular rash|maculopapular]], [[erythema]]tous rash.

Measles is spread through respiration (contact with [[fluid]]s from an [[infection|infected]] person's nose and mouth, either directly or through [[Particulate|aerosol]] transmission), and is highly contagious—90% of people without [[immune system|immunity]] sharing living space with an infected person will catch it.<ref>{{cite report|date=May 16, 2012|title=Risk of infection East and Southwest Asia|url=http://occucareinternational.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/East-and-southeast-asia.pdf|publisher=Occucare International|page=6}}</ref> An [[asymptomatic]] [[incubation period]] occurs nine to twelve days from initial exposure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=C.

There is no specific treatment for measles. Most patients with uncomplicated measles will recover with rest and supportive treatment. It is, however, important to seek medical advice if the patient becomes more unwell, as they may be developing complications. For the vast majority of healthy patients, measles is not serious; though in some cases complications may occur, which may include bronchitis, and – very rarely – [[Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis|panencephalitis]] which is usually fatal.<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/subacute_panencephalitis/subacute_panencephalitis.htm] “NINDS Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis Information Page”</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Morbillivirus measles infection.jpg|thumb|Skin of a patient after 3 days of measles infection.]]
[[File:Koplik spots, measles 6111 lores.jpg|left|thumb|Presentation of “Koplik's spots” on the third pre-eruptive day, indicative of the beginning onset of measles.]]
The classical signs and symptoms of measles include four-day fevers and the three '''C'''s — [[cough]], [[coryza]] (head cold), and [[conjunctivitis]] (red eyes) — along with fever, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], and rashes. The fever may reach up to 40&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] (104&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]]). [[Koplik's spots]] seen inside the mouth are [[pathognomonic]] (diagnostic) for measles, but are not often seen, even in real cases of measles, because they are transient and may disappear within a day of arising.

The characteristic measles rash is classically described as a generalized, [[maculopapular rash|maculopapular]], [[erythema]]tous rash that begins several days after the fever starts. It starts on the back of the ears and, after a few hours, spreads to the head and neck before spreading to cover most of the body, often causing [[itch]]ing. The rash is said to "stain", changing color from red to dark brown, before disappearing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The measles rash appears two to four days after the initial symptoms and lasts for up to eight days.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Measles/Pages/Symptoms.aspx NHS UK: Symptoms of measles.

===Complications===
Complications with measles are relatively common, ranging from the relatively mild and less serious ones like [[diarrhea]] to more serious ones such as [[pneumonia]],<ref>{{cite pmid|20847499|noedit}}</ref> [[otitis media]],<ref>{{cite doi|10.1017/S0022215100026712|noedit}}</ref> acute [[encephalitis]] (rarely SSPE – [[subacute sclerosing panencephalitis]]),<ref>{{cite pmid|23622327|noedit}}</ref> and [[corneal ulcer]]ation (leading to [[corneal abrasion|corneal scarring]]).<ref>{{cite pmid|3580349|noedit}}</ref> Complications are usually more severe in adults who catch the virus.<ref>{{cite pmid|20200172|noedit}}</ref>

Between the years 1987 and 2000, the case fatality rate across the United States was three measles-attributable deaths per 1000 cases, or 0.3%.<ref name="The Clinical Significance of Measles: A Review">

Measles is caused by the measles virus, a single-stranded, negative-sense enveloped RNA virus of the genus ''[[Morbillivirus]]'' within the family ''[[Paramyxoviridae]]''. Humans are the natural hosts of the virus; no animal reservoirs are known to exist. This highly contagious virus is spread by coughing and sneezing via close personal contact or direct contact with secretions.

Risk factors for measles virus infection include the following:

*Children with immunodeficiency due to [[HIV]] or AIDS, [[leukemia]], [[Alkylation#Alkylating agents|alkylating agents]], or [[Corticosteroid#Uses of corticosteroids|corticosteroid therapy]], regardless of immunization status
*Travel to areas where measles is endemic or contact with travelers to endemic areas
*Infants who lose passive antibody before the age of routine immunization

Risk factors for severe measles and its complications include the following:

*Malnutrition
*Underlying immunodeficiency
*Pregnancy
*Vitamin A deficiency<ref>{{cite report|author=Chen S.S.P.|date=October 3, 2011|title=Measles|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/966220-overview|publisher=Medscape}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vitamin A|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
{{unsourced section|date=April 2013}}
Clinical diagnosis of measles requires a history of fever of at least three days, with at least one of the three C's (cough, coryza, conjunctivitis). Observation of [[Koplik's spots]] is also diagnostic of measles.

Alternatively, laboratory diagnosis of measles can be done with confirmation of positive measles [[IgM]] antibodies or isolation of measles virus RNA from respiratory specimens.  In patients where [[Venipuncture|phlebotomy]] is not possible, saliva can be collected for salivary measles-specific [[IgA]] testing.  Positive contact with other patients known to have measles adds strong [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] evidence to the diagnosis. The contact with any infected person in any way, including semen through sex, saliva, or mucus, can cause infection.

==Prevention==
[[File:Measles vaccination worldwide.png|thumb|350px|Rates of measles vaccination worldwide]]
[[File:Measles US 1944-2007 inset.png|thumb|350px|Measles cases reported in the United States.]]
[[File:Measles incidence England&Wales 1940-2007.png|thumb|350px|Measles cases reported in England and [[Wales]].]]
In developed countries, most children are immunized against measles by the age of 18 months, generally as part of a three-part [[MMR vaccine]] (measles, [[mumps]], and [[rubella]]). The vaccination is generally not given earlier than this because sufficient of the antimeasles [[immunoglobulins]] (antibodies) acquired via the placenta from the mother during pregnancy may persist to prevent the vaccine viruses being effective. A second dose is usually given to children between the ages of four and five, to increase rates of immunity. Vaccination rates have been high enough to make measles relatively uncommon. Even a single case in a college dormitory or similar setting is often met with a local vaccination program, in case any of the people exposed are not already immune.

In developing countries where measles is highly [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]] doctors recommend two doses of [[vaccine]] be given at six and nine months of age.  The vaccine should be given whether the child is HIV-infected or not.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Helfand RF|title=Evaluation of the immune response to a 2-dose measles vaccination schedule administered at 6 and 9 months of age to HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children in Malawi|journal=J Infect Dis|year=2008|volume=198|issue=10|pmid=18828743|pages=1457–65|doi=10.1086/592756|author-separator=,|author2=Witte D|author3=Fowlkes A|display-authors=3|last4=Garcia|first4=Philip|last5=Yang|first5=Chunfu|last6=Fudzulani|first6=Richard|last7=Walls|first7=Laura|last8=Bae|first8=Sun|last9=Strebel|first9=Peter}}</ref>  The vaccine is less effective in HIV-infected infants, but the risk of adverse reactions is low. Measles vaccination programs are often used to deliver other child health interventions, as well, such as bed nets to protect against malaria, antiparasite medicine and vitamin A supplements, and so contribute to the reduction of child deaths from other causes.<ref name="UNICEF">[http://www.unicef.org/media/media_38076.html UNICEF Joint Press Release]</ref>

Unvaccinated populations are at risk for the disease.  Traditionally low vaccination rates in northern [[Nigeria]] dropped further in the early 2000s when radical preachers promoted a rumor that polio vaccines were a Western plot to sterilize Muslims and infect them with HIV.  The number of cases of measles rose significantly, and hundreds of children died.<ref>{{cite news |title= Measles kills more than 500 children so far in 2005 |publisher=IRIN |date=2005-03-21 |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=53506 |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> This could also have had to do with the aforementioned other health-promoting measures often given with the vaccine.

Claims of a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism were raised in a 1998 paper in ''[[The Lancet]]'', a respected British [[medical journal]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wakefield A | year = 1998 | title = Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm | journal = Lancet | volume = 351 | issue = 9103| pages = 637–41 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 | pmid = 9500320 | author-separator = , | author2 = Murch S | author3 = Anthony A | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Linnell | first4 = J | last5 = Casson | first5 = DM | last6 = Malik | first6 = M | last7 = Berelowitz | first7 = M | last8 = Dhillon | first8 = AP | last9 = Thomson | first9 = MA }}{{Retracted paper|PMID 20137807|intentional=yes}}</ref> Later investigation by ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' journalist [[Brian Deer]] discovered the lead author of the article, [[Andrew Wakefield]], had multiple undeclared [[conflicts of interest]],<ref>{{cite news |author=Deer B |title=Revealed: MMR research scandal |newspaper=The Sunday Times |location=London |date=2004-02-22 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article1027603.ece}}<br/>

==Treatment==
There is no specific treatment for measles. Most patients with uncomplicated measles will recover with rest and supportive treatment. It is, however, important to seek medical advice if the patient becomes more unwell, as they may be developing complications.

Some patients will develop [[pneumonia]] as a sequelae to the measles. Other complications include ear infections, [[bronchitis]], and [[encephalitis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Complications of Measles|url=http://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/complications.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevnetion (CDC)}}</ref> Acute measles encephalitis has a mortality rate of 15%. While there is no specific treatment for measles encephalitis, [[antibiotics]] are required for [[bacterial]] [[pneumonia]], [[sinusitis]], and [[bronchitis]] that can follow measles.

All other treatment addresses symptoms, with [[ibuprofen]], or [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) to reduce fever and pain and, if required, a fast-acting [[bronchodilator]] for cough. As for [[aspirin]], some research has suggested a correlation between children who take aspirin and the development of [[Reye's syndrome]].<ref name='Starko1980'>{{cite journal | title = Reye's Syndrome and Salicylate Use | journal = Pediatrics | date = 6 dec 1980 | first = Karen | last = Starko | coauthors = George Ray, Lee Dominguez, Warren Stronberg, Dora Woodall | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 859–64| url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/6/859 | accessdate = 2011-03-17 | quote = It is postulated that salicylate [taken by school-age children], operating in a dose-dependent manner, possibly potentiated by fever, represents a primary causative agent of Reye's syndrome. | pmid=7454476}}</ref> Some research has shown aspirin may not be the only medication associated with Reye's, and even [[antiemetics]] have been implicated,<ref>{{cite journal | title = Reye syndrome revisited: a descriptive term covering a group of heterogeneous disorders  | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics |date = April 2000| first = Maria | last = Casteels-Van Daele | coauthors = Christel Van Geet, Carine Wouters, Ephrem Eggermont | volume = 159 | issue = 9 | pages = 641–8| url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/kb0pe634bymrn2ur/ | accessdate = 2011-03-17 | quote = Reye syndrome is a non-specific descriptive term covering a group of heterogeneous disorders.

Acute measles encephalitis is another serious risk of measles virus infection. It typically occurs two days to one week after the breakout of the measles [[exanthem]], and begins with very high fever, severe headache, convulsions, and altered mentation. Patient may become comatose, and death or brain injury may occur.<ref>{{MerckManual|14|193|b||}}</ref>

In 2011 the WHO estimated that there were 158,000 deaths caused by Measles. Mortality in developed countries is ~1/1000. In sub-Saharan Africa, mortality is 10%. In cases with complications, the rate may rise to 20–30%. In 2010, approximately 380 deaths occurred every day from measles.<ref>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs286/en/, World Health Organization Fact sheet N°286. Retrieved June 28, 2012.</ref> According to the 2011 United Nations [[Millennium Development Goals]] report, "the combination of increased immunization coverage and the opportunity for second-dose immunizations led to a 78% drop in measles deaths worldwide. These averted deaths represent one quarter of the decline in mortality from all causes among children under five." <ref>{{cite web|title=Millennium Development Goals|url=http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/reports.shtml|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref>  

Even in countries where vaccination has been introduced, rates may remain high. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], vaccination was introduced in 1985. There were 99,903 cases that year. Within two years, the number of cases had fallen to 201, but this fall was not sustained. Measles is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality. Worldwide, the fatality rate has been significantly reduced by a vaccination campaign led by partners in the [[Measles Initiative]]: the [[American Red Cross]], the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF and the WHO. Globally, measles fell 60% from an estimated 873,000 deaths in 1999 to 345,000 in 2005.<ref name="UNICEF"/> Estimates for 2008 indicate deaths fell further to 164,000 globally, with 77% of the remaining measles deaths in 2008 occurring within the Southeast Asian region.<ref>WHO Weekly Epidemiology Record, 4th December 2009 [http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8449/en/index.html WHO.int]</ref>

In 2006–07 there were 12,132 cases in 32 European countries: 85% occurred in five countries: Germany, Italy, Romania, Switzerland and the UK. 80% occurred in children and there were 7 deaths.

Five out of six WHO regions have set goals to eliminate measles, and at the 63rd World Health Assembly in May 2010, delegates agreed a global target of a 95% reduction in measles mortality by 2015 from the level seen in 2000, as well as to move towards eventual [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]]. However, no specific global target date for eradication has yet been agreed to as of May 2010.<ref name="WHA63_11_15">{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA63/A63_18-en.pdf |title=Sixty-third World Health Assembly Agenda provisional agenda item 11.15 Global eradication of measles |accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref><ref name="WHO63_daily_notes_4">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2010/wha63/journal4/en/index.html |title=Sixty-third World Health Assembly notes from day four| accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref>

==Evolution==
The measles virus evolved from the formerly widespread [[rinderpest]] virus, which infects cattle.<ref name="Furuse2010"/> [[Molecular phylogenetics|Sequence analysis]] has suggested that the two viruses most probably diverged in the 11th and 12th centuries, though the periods as early as the 5th century fall within the 95% [[confidence interval]] of these calculations.<ref name="Furuse2010">{{cite journal |author=Furuse Y, Suzuki A, Oshitani H |title=Origin of measles virus: divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries |journal=Virol.

==Virology==

The measles virus has two envelope glycoproteins on the viral surface - hemagglutinin (H) and membrane fusion protein (F). Thes eproteins are rewsponsible for host cell bidning and invasion. Three receptors for the H protein have been identified to date: complement regulatory molecule [[CD46]], the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule ([[SLAM]]) and the cell adhesion molecule [[Nectin|Nectin-4]].<ref name=Lu2013>Lu G, Gao GF, Yan J (2013) The receptors and entry of measles virus: a review. Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao 29(1):1-9</ref>

==Genotypes==
{{unsourced section|date=April 2013}}
The WHO currently recognises 8 clades of measles (A – H). Subtypes are designed with numerals – A1, D2 etc. Currently a total of 23 subtypes are recognised. The sequencing of the 450 nucleotides that code for the C‐terminal 150 amino acids of N are the minimum amount of sequence data required for genotyping a measles virus isolate. The genotyping scheme was introduced in 1998 and extended in 2002 and 2003.

The major genotypes differ between countries and restatus of measles circulation within that country or region. Indigenous transmission of measles virus was interrupted in the United States and Australia by 2000 and the Americas by 2002.

==History and culture==

===History===
[[File:Measles Aztec drawing.jpg|thumb|16th century [[Aztec]] drawing of someone with measles]]
The [[Antonine Plague]], 165–180 AD, also known as the Plague of [[Galen]], who described it, was probably [[smallpox]] or measles. The disease killed as many as one-third of the population in some areas, and decimated the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] army.<ref>[http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1996-7/Smith.html Plague in the Ancient World]</ref> Estimates of the timing of evolution of measles seem to suggest this plague was something other than measles. The first scientific description of measles and its distinction from smallpox and [[chickenpox]] is credited to the [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Persian]] physician [[Rhazes]] (860–932), who published ''The Book of Smallpox and Measles''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harminder S. Dua, Ahmad Muneer Otri|first=Arun D. Singh|year=2008|title=Abu Bakr Razi|journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology|publisher=[[BMJ Group]]|volume=92|page=1324}}</ref> Given what is now known about the evolution of measles, this account is remarkably timely.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning it has been continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations not exposed to measles, exposure to a new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in [[Cuba]] killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox.  Two years later, measles was responsible for the deaths of half the population of [[Honduras]], and had ravaged [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Inca]] civilization.<ref>{{Cite book

Since the beginning of September, 2009, [[Johannesburg]], a city in [[Gauteng]], [[South Africa]] reported about 48 cases of measles.

Some experts stated that the stubborn persistence of the disease in Europe could be a stumbling block to global eradication.  It has proven difficult to vaccinate a sufficient number of children in Europe to eradicate the disease, because of opposition on philosophical or religious grounds, or fears of side-effects, or because some minority groups are hard to reach, or simply because parents forget to have their children vaccinated.  Vaccination is not mandatory in Europe, in contrast to the United States and many Latin American countries, where children must be vaccinated before they enter school.<ref name=EURPROB/>

On September 29, 2011, Ecuador's Ministry of Health reported an outbreak with 42 cases of measles recorded inside a few adjacent communities of the central Andean province of Tungurahua. No fatalities had been reported as of that date.
