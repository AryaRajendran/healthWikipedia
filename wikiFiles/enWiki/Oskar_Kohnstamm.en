Dr. '''Oskar Felix Kohnstamm''' (13 April 1871 in [[Pfungstadt]] - 6 November 1917 in [[Frankfurt am Main]]) was a German [[neurologist]] and [[psychiatrist]]. Initially trained in internal medicine in [[Giessen]] and [[Strassbourg]] he received his doctors degree in [[Berlin]] in 1894. Kohnstamm then began as a general practitioner in [[Königstein im Taunus]], a small town in [[Hesse]]. There, he became more and more interested in [[neurology]] and [[psychiatry]]. 

His wife, Eva, daughter of [[Johannes Gad]] - one of Kohnstamm's Berlin professors, agreed to have occasionally depressive patients as guests in the house, who then got chores assigned in housekeeping, gardening or minding the children. Gradually, the idea ripened to build a small [[sanatorium]] for treating [[clinical depression]]s. The house, build in [[Jugendstil]] style, opened in 1905 and was expanded in 1912.
Kohnstamm was no follower of [[Sigmund Freud]] but worked often with [[hypnosis]].

Among his patients were three young men who would become world-famous: the painter [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] (1880-1938), the actor [[Alexander Moissi]] (1879-1935) and the conductor [[Otto Klemperer]] (1885-1973). 

Even the playwright [[Carl Sternheim]] (1878 – 1942) has been in medical treatment in Kohnstamms sanatorium during the [[First World War]]. The poets [[Stefan George]], [[Karl Wolfskehl]], the archaeologist [[Botho Graef]] and the architect [[Henry van de Velde]] have been friends of him.
