'''Romberg's test''' or the '''Romberg maneuver''' is a test used by doctors and physical therapists in a [[neurology|neurological examination]], and also as a test for drunken driving. The exam is based on the premise that a person requires at least two of the three following senses to maintain balance while standing: proprioception (the ability to know one's body in space); vestibular function (the ability to know one's head position in space); and vision (which can be used to monitor [and adjust for] changes in body position). 

A patient who has a problem with proprioception can still maintain balance by using vestibular function and vision. In the Romberg test, the patient is stood up and asked to close his eyes. A loss of balance is interpreted as a positive Romberg sign.

The Romberg test is a test of the body's sense of positioning ([[proprioception]]), which requires healthy functioning of the [[dorsal columns]] of the [[spinal cord]].<ref name=pmid12867698>{{cite journal |author=Khasnis A, Gokula RM |title=Romberg's test |journal=Journal of Postgraduate Medicine |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=169–72 |date=1 April 2003 |pmid=12867698 |url=http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2003;volume=49;issue=2;spage=169;epage=72;aulast=Khasnis}}</ref>

The Romberg test is used to investigate the cause of loss of motor coordination ([[ataxia]]). A positive Romberg test suggests that the ataxia is '''sensory''' in nature, that is, depending on loss of proprioception. If a patient is ataxic and Romberg's test is not positive, it suggests that ataxia is '''cerebellar''' in nature, that is, depending on localized cerebellar dysfunction instead.

It is used as an indicator for possible alcohol or drug [[DUI|impaired driving]] and neurological [[decompression sickness]].<ref name=bridge>{{cite book |last= Bridge |first= Carl J. |title=[[Alcoholism and Driving]] |publisher= [[Charles C Thomas]] |year= 1972 |isbn=0-398-02243-7 }}</ref><ref name=spums>{{cite journal |author=Lee CT |title=Sharpening the Sharpened Romberg |journal=SPUMS Journal |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=125–32 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=11542272 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5943}}</ref>  When used to test impaired driving, the test is performed with the subject estimating 30 seconds in his head.  This is used to gauge the subject's internal clock and can be an indicator of stimulant or depressant use.

== Procedure ==
Ask the subject to stand erect with feet together and eyes closed.  Stand close by as a precaution in order to stop the person from falling over and hurting himself or herself.  Watch the movement of the body in relation to a perpendicular object behind the subject (corner of the room, door, window etc.).  A positive sign is noted when a swaying, sometimes irregular swaying and even toppling over occurs.  The essential feature is that the patient becomes more unsteady with eyes closed.

The essential features of the test are as follows:
# the subject stands with feet together, eyes open and hands by the sides.
# the subject closes the eyes while the examiner observes for a full minute.

Because the examiner is trying to elicit whether the patient falls when the eyes are closed, it is advisable to stand ready to catch the falling patient. For large subjects, a strong assistant is recommended.

Romberg's test is positive if the patient sways or falls while the patient's eyes are closed.<ref name=pmid11071500>{{cite journal |author=Lanska DJ, Goetz CG |title=Romberg's sign: development, adoption, and adaptation in the 19th century |journal=Neurology |volume=55 |issue=8 |pages=1201–6 |year=2000 |month=October |pmid=11071500 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11071500}}</ref>

Patients with a positive result are said to demonstrate Romberg's sign or ''Rombergism''. They can also be described as ''Romberg's positive''. The basis of this test is that balance comes from the combination of several neurological systems, namely proprioception, vestibular input, and vision. If any two of these systems are working the person should be able to demonstrate a fair degree of balance. The key to the test is that vision is taken away by asking the patient to close their eyes. This leaves only two of the three systems remaining and if there is a [[vestibular disorder]] ([[labyrinthine]]) or a sensory disorder ([[proprioception|proprioceptive dysfunction]]) the patient will become much more imbalanced.

== Physiology ==
Maintaining balance while standing in the stationary position relies on intact sensory pathways, sensorimotor integration centers and [[spinal cord#Motor organization|motor pathways]].

The main sensory inputs are:
# Joint position sense ([[proprioception]]), carried in the [[spinal cord#Somatosensory organization|dorsal columns of the spinal cord]];
# [[Visual perception|Vision]]
# [[Vestibular apparatus]]

Crucially, the [[brain]] can obtain sufficient information to maintain balance if any two of the three systems are intact.

Sensorimotor integration is carried out by the [[cerebellum]] and by the [[spinal cord#Somatosensory organization|dorsal column]]-[[medial lemniscus]] tract.  The motor pathway is the [[corticospinal tract|corticospinal (pyramidal) tract]] and the medial and lateral [[vestibulospinal tract|vestibular tracts]].

The first stage of the test (standing with the eyes open with hands on hips), demonstrates that at least two of the three sensory pathways is intact, and that sensorimotor integration and the motor pathway are functioning. The patient must stand unsupported with eyes open and hands on hips for 30 seconds. If the patient takes a step or removes a hand from the hip, the timer is stopped. The patient may make two attempts to complete the 30 seconds. 

Similar to the sensory organization test, the visual pathway would then be removed by closing the eyes.  If the proprioceptive and vestibular pathways are intact, balance will be maintained.  But if [[proprioception]] is defective, two of the sensory inputs will be absent and the patient will sway then fall. Similar to the Romberg Test, the patient must stand unsupported with eyes closed and hands on hips for 30 seconds. The patient may make two attempts to complete the 30 seconds. <ref name=spums/>

A variation of the Romberg Test, the Sharpened Romberg Test, consists of narrowing the patient’s base of support by placing feet in a heel to toe position. Nonetheless, test instructions do not specify which foot, preferred or non-preferred, should be placed in front of the other. The patient should be instructed to keep hands on hips for the whole 30 seconds. If the patient takes a step or removes hands from hips, the timer is stopped and the patient may attempt the test one more time. <ref name=athens>{{cite journal |author=E. Panaretaki, S. Kostadakos, V. Hatzitaki, G. Grouios |title=Standing with one foot in front of the other (sharpened romberg position) : footedness effect |journal=Centro Esportivo Virtual - CEV |url=http://cev.org.br/biblioteca/standing-with-one-foot-in-front-of-the-other-sharpened-romberg-position-footedness-effect/}}</ref>
The sharpened Romberg does have an early [[Habituation|learning effect]] that will plateau between the third and fourth attempts.<ref name=spums/>

=== Positive Romberg ===
Romberg's test is positive in conditions causing [[sensory ataxia]] such as:
* Vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin B12 (cobalamin)
* Conditions affecting the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, such as [[tabes dorsalis]] ([[neurosyphilis]]), in which it was first described.<ref name=pmid12867698/>
* Conditions affecting the sensory nerves (sensory [[peripheral neuropathies]]), such as chronic inflammatory [[demyelinating disease|demyelinating]] polyradiculoneuropathy ([[CIDP]]).
* [[Friedreich's Ataxia]]

== Romberg and cerebellar function ==
'''Romberg's test is not a test of [[cerebellum|cerebellar]] function''', as it is commonly misconstrued.  Patients with [[ataxia|cerebellar ataxia]] will, generally, be unable to balance even with the eyes open;<ref>Blumenfeld H. Romberg Test. neuroexam.com. URL: [http://www.neuroexam.com/content.php?p=37 http://www.neuroexam.com/content.php?p=37]. Accessed on: April 22, 2007.</ref> therefore, the test cannot proceed beyond the first step and no patient with cerebellar ataxia can correctly be described as Romberg's positive.  Rather, Romberg's test is a test of the [[proprioception]] [[Sensory receptor|receptor]]s and [[Metabolic pathway|pathways]] function.
A positive Romberg's test has been shown to be 90% sensitive for [[lumbar spinal stenosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Katz JN, Harris MB |title=Clinical practice. Lumbar spinal stenosis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=358 |issue=8 |pages=818–25 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18287604 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp0708097}}</ref>

== History ==
The test was named after the German neurologist [[Moritz Heinrich Romberg]]<ref name=pmid12867698/> (1795-1873), who also gave his name to [[Parry-Romberg syndrome]] and [[Howship-Romberg sign]].
