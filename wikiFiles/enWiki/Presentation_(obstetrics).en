In [[obstetrics]], the '''presentation''' of a [[fetus]] about to be [[Childbirth|born]] refers to which [[Human anatomy|anatomical part]] of the fetus is leading, that is, is closest to the [[human pelvis|pelvic]] inlet of the birth canal. According to the leading part, this is identified as a [[cephalic presentation|cephalic]], [[breech presentation|breech]], or [[shoulder presentation|shoulder]] presentation. A '''malpresentation''' is any other presentation than a vertex presentation (with the top of the head first).

==Classification==
Thus the various presentations are:
* [[cephalic presentation]] (head first):
** vertex ([[crown (anatomy)|crown]]) &mdash; the most common and associated with the fewest complications
** [[sinciput]] (forehead)
** brow (eyebrows)
** face
** chin
* [[breech presentation]]<ref name=kish>{{cite book |last= Kish|first= Karen|coauthors= Joseph V. Collea|editor= Alan H. DeCherney|others= Lauren Nathan|title= Current Obstetric & Gynecologic Diagnosis & Treatment|accessdate= 2008-06-16|edition= Ninth Edition|year= 2003|month= |publisher= Lange/McGraw-Hill|isbn= 0-07-118207-1|pages= 369|chapter= Malpresentation & Cord Prolapse (Chapter 21)}}</ref> (buttocks or feet first):
** complete breech
** footling breech
** frank breech
* [[shoulder presentation]]:
**arm
**shoulder
**trunk

==Related obstetrical terms==
===Attitude===
* Definition: Relationship of fetal head to spine: 
**flexed, (this is the normal situation)
**neutral (“military”), 
**extende.

===Position===
* Definition: Relationship of presenting part to maternal pelvis: and based on presentation:
** [[Cephalic presentation]]
*** Vertex presentation with longitudinal lie:<ref name=kish/>
****Left occipitoanterior (LOA)&mdash;the [[occiput]] is close to the vagina (hence known as vertex presentation) faces anteriorly (forward with mother standing) and towards left. This is the most common position and lie.
****Right occipitoanterior (ROA)&mdash;the occiput faces anteriorly and towards right. Less common than LOA, but not associated with labor complications.
****Left occipitoposterior (LOP)&mdash;the occiput faces posteriorly (behind) and towards left.
****Right occipitoposterior (ROP)&mdash;the occiput faces posteriorly and towards right.
****Occipitoanterior &mdash;the occiput faces anteriorly (absolutely straight without any turning to any of the sides)
****Occipitoposterior &mdash;the occiput faces posteriorly (absolutely straight without any turning to any of the sides)
*** Face presentation
**[[Breech presentation]] with longitudinal lie:<ref name=kish/>  
***Left [[sacrum]] anterior (LSA)&mdash;the buttocks, as against the occiput of the vertex presentation, like close to the vagina (hence known as breech presentation), which like anteriorly and towards the left.
***Right sacrum anterior (RSA)&mdash;the buttocks face anteriorly and towards the right.
***Left sacrum posterior (LSP)&mdash;the buttocks face posteriorly and towards the left.
***Right sacrum posterior (RSP)&mdash;the buttocks face posteriorly and towards right.
***Sacrum anterior(SA)&mdash;the buttocks face anteriorly.
***Sacrum posterior (SP)&mdash;the buttocks face posteriorly.
** [[Shoulder presentation]] with transverse lie are classified into four types, based on the location of the [[scapula]] (shoulderblade); note: this presentation needs to be delivered by [[cesarean section]].
***Left scapula-anterior (LSA)
***Right scapula-anterior (RSA)
***Left scapula-posterior (LSP)
***Right scapula-posterior (RSP)

===Lie===
* Definition: Relationship between the longitudinal axis of fetus and mother: 
**longitudinal, (resulting in either cephalic or breech presentation)
**oblique, (unstable, will eventually become either transverse or longitudinal) 
**transverse (resulting in shoulder presentation).
