'''Tendinosis''', sometimes called chronic tendinitis, tendinosus, chronic [[tendinopathy]], or chronic tendon injury, is damage to a [[tendon]] at a cellular level (the suffix "osis" implies a pathology of chronic degeneration without inflammation).  It is thought to be caused by microtears in the connective tissue in and around the tendon, leading to an increase in tendon repair cells. This may lead to reduced [[tensile strength]], thus increasing the chance of tendon rupture. Tendinosis is often misdiagnosed as [[tendinitis]] due to the limited understanding of tendinopathies by the medical community.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murrell GA |title=Understanding tendinopathies |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=392–3 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12453831 |pmc=1724561 |url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12453831 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.36.6.392}}</ref>
Classical characteristics of "tendinosis" include degenerative changes in the collagenous matrix, hypercellularity, hypervascularity, and a lack of inflammatory cells which has challenged the original misnomer "tendinitis".<ref name="pmid21144004">{{cite journal| author=Fu SC, Rolf C, Cheuk YC, Lui PP, Chan KM| title=Deciphering the pathogenesis of tendinopathy: a three-stages process. | journal=Sports Med Arthrosc Rehabil Ther Technol | year= 2010 | volume= 2 | issue=  | pages= 30 | pmid=21144004 | doi=10.1186/1758-2555-2-30 | pmc=3006368   }} </ref>

==Diagnosis==
Swelling in a region of micro damage or partial tear may be detected visually or by [[palpation|touch]].  Increased water content and disorganized collagen matrix in tendon [[lesion]]s may be detected by [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]].

Symptoms can vary from an ache or pain and [[stiffness]] to the local area of the tendon, or a burning that surrounds the whole [[joint]] around the inflamed tendon. With this condition, the pain is usually worse during and after activity, and the tendon and joint area can become stiffer the following day as swelling impinges on the movement of the tendon. Many patients report stressful situations in their life in correlation with the beginnings of pain, which may contribute to the symptoms.

==Treatment==
[[Tendons]] are very slow to heal if injured. Partial tears heal by the rapid production of disorganized [[type-III collagen]], which is weaker than normal tendon.{{fact|date=June 2012}} Recurrence of injury in the damaged region of tendon is common. 

[[Physical therapy]], rest, and gradual return to the activity in which tendinosis was experienced is a common therapy.  There is evidence to suggest that tendinosis is not an inflammatory disorder; anti-inflammatory drugs are not an effective treatment,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Khan |first=K.M. |coauthors=Cook, J.L., Kannus, P., Maffulli, N., Bonar, S.F. |title=Time to abandon the "tendinitis" myth : Painful, overuse tendon conditions have a non-inflammatory pathology |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=324 |pages=626–7 |date=2002-03-16 |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/324/7338/626 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7338.626  | accessdate = 2007-04-02 |pmid=11895810 |issue=7338 |pmc=1122566 }}</ref> and inflammation is not the cause of this type of tendon dysfunction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marsolais D, Duchesne E, Côté CH, Frenette J. |title=Inflammatory cells do not decrease the ultimate tensile strength of intact tendons in vivo and in vitro: protective role of mechanical loading |journal=J Appl Physiol |year=2007 |issue=1 |volume=102 |pages=3–4 |pmid =16916923 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00162.2006 }}</ref> There is a variety of treatment options, but more research is necessary to determine their effectiveness.

==On-going research into new treatments==
Both [[Muscle contraction#Eccentric contraction|eccentric loading]] and [[extracorporeal shockwave therapy]] are currently being researched as possible treatments for tendinosis.  One study found both modalities to be equally effective in treating tendinosis of the Achilles tendon and more effective than a 'wait and see' approach.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rompe JD, Nafe B, Furia JP, Maffulli N |title=Eccentric loading, shock-wave treatment, or a wait-and-see policy for tendinopathy of the main body of tendo Achillis: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Am J Sports Med |year=2007 |issue=35 |volume=3 |pages=374–83 |pmid =17244902|doi=10.1177/0363546506295940 }}</ref>  Other treatments for which research is on-going includes [[Tocopherol|vitamin E]], [[Pyridoxine|vitamin B6]],  [[nitric oxide]], and [[stem cell]] injections.

===Vitamin E===
[[Tocopherol|Vitamin E]] has been found to increase the activity of [[fibroblast]]s, leading to increased collagen fibrils and synthesis, which seems to speed up the regeneration and increase the regenerative capacity of tendons.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gonzalez |first=Santander R |coauthors=Plasencia Arriba MA, Martinez Cuadrado G, Gonzalez-Santander Martinez M & Monteagudo de la Rosa M. |title=Effects of "in situ" vitamin E on fibroblast differentiation and on collagen fibril development in the regenerating tendon |journal=The International Journal of Developmental Biology |volume=1 |issue=Supplemental |pages=181–2  | publisher =University Of The Basque Country Press |year=1996 |pmid=9087752 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Plasencia. |first=M.A. |coauthors=Ortiz C., Vazquez B., San Roman J., Lopez-Bravo A., Lopez-Alonso A. |title=Resorbable polyacrylic hydrogels derived from vitamin E and their application in the healing of tendons |journal=Journal of Materials Science.

===Nitric oxide===
[[Nitric oxide]] (NO) also appears to play a role in tendon healing<ref>{{cite journal |last=Xia |first=W. |coauthors=Szomor Z., Wang Y. & Murrell G.A. |title=Nitric oxide enhances collagen synthesis in cultured human tendon cells |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=159–72  | publisher =Wiley |year=2006  |pmid =16435353 |doi=10.1002/jor.20060 }}</ref> and inhibition of its synthesis impairs tendon healing.<ref>{{cite journal

===Soft tissue mobilization===
Augmented Soft Tissue Mobilization (ASTM) is a form of [[manual therapy]] that has been shown in studies on rats to speed the healing of tendons by increasing fibroblast activity.<ref>[http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/1997/03000/Rat_tendon_morphologic_and_functional_changes.5.aspx Craig J.

===Eccentric loading===
Perhaps the most promising avenue of therapy is indicated in a line of research finding dramatic rates of recovery including complete remodeling of chronically damaged tendon tissue with [[Muscle contraction#Eccentric contraction|eccentric loading]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Alfredson Tom , MD |first=Håkan |coauthors=Pietilä, T., Jonsson, P. & Lorentzon, R. |title=Heavy-Load Eccentric Calf Muscle Training For the Treatment of Chronic Achilles Tendinosis |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=26 |pages=360–6  | publisher =American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine |year=1998 |url=http://ajs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/360 | accessdate = 2007-04-02 |pmid=9617396 |issue=3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Mafi |first=N. |coauthors=Lorentzon R. & Alfredson H. |title=Superior short-term results with eccentric calf muscle training compared to concentric training in a randomized prospective multicenter study on patients with chronic Achilles tendinosis |journal=Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=42–7  | publisher =Springer International |year=2001  |pmid =11269583 |doi=10.1007/s001670000148 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Fahlstrom . |first=M. |coauthors=Jonsson P., Lorentzon R. & Alfredson H. |title=Chronic Achilles tendon pain treated with eccentric calf-muscle training |journal=Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=327–33  | publisher =Springer International |year=2003 |pmid = 12942235 |doi=10.1007/s00167-003-0418-z }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Roos |first=E.M. |coauthors=Engstrom M., Lagerquist A. & Soderberg B. |title=Clinical improvement after 6 weeks of eccentric exercise in patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy -- a randomized trial with 1-year follow-up |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=286–95 | publisher = Munksgaard International Publishers |year=2004 |pmid = 15387802 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.378.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Öhberg |first=L. |coauthors=Lorentzon R. & Alfredson H. |title=Eccentric training in patients with chronic Achilles tendinosis: normalised tendon structure and decreased thickness at follow up |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=38 |pages=8–11  | publisher = BMJ Publishing Group Ltd. |year=2004 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2001.000284 |pmid=14751936 |issue=1 |pmc=1724744 }}</ref><ref>>{{cite journal |last=Jonsson |first=P. |coauthors=Alfredson H. |title=Superior results with eccentric compared to concentric quadriceps training in patients with jumper's knee: a prospective randomised study |journal=British journal of sports medicine |volume=39 |issue=11 |pages=847–50  | publisher =BMJ Publishing Group |year=2005 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2005.018630 |pmid=16244196 |pmc=1725058}}</ref><ref name=Wilson05/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Rees |first=J.D. |coauthors=Wilson A.M. & Wolman R.L. |title=Current concepts in the management of tendon disorders |journal=Rheumatology |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=508–21  | publisher =Oxford University Press |year=2006 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/kel046 |pmid=16490749 }}</ref>

===Inflatable brace===
The use of an inflatable brace (AirHeel) was shown to be as effective as eccentric loading in the treatment of chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Both modalities produced significant reduction in pain scores, but their combination was no more effective than either treatment alone.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Petersen W, Welp R, Rosenbaum D |title=Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy: A Prospective Randomized Study Comparing the Therapeutic Effect of Eccentric Training, the AirHeel Brace, and a Combination of Both |journal=Am J Sports Med |date=June 14, 2007 |pmid =17569792|volume=35|issue=10|pages=1659–67|doi=10.1177/0363546507303558 }}</ref>

===Tendon bioengineering===
The future of non-surgical care for tendinosis is likely bioengineering.  Ligament reconstruction is possible using [[mesenchymal]] stem cells and a silk scaffold.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fan H, Liu H, Wong EJ, Toh SL, Goh JC |title=In vivo study of anterior cruciate ligament regeneration using mesenchymal stem cells and silk scaffold |journal=Biomaterials |volume=29 |issue=23 |pages=3324–37 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18462787 |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.04.012 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0142-9612(08)00244-5}}</ref> These same stem cells were capable of seeding repair of damaged animal tendons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Long JH, Qi M, Huang XY, Lei SR, Ren LC |title=[Repair of rabbit tendon by autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells] |language=Chinese |journal=Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=210–2 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15996290 }}</ref> Autologous tenocyte implantation is currently being tested for tendinosis.
