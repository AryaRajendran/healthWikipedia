The '''gastrointestinal hormones''' (or '''gut hormones''') constitute a group of [[hormone]]s secreted by [[enteroendocrine cell]]s in the [[stomach]], [[pancreas]], and [[small intestine]] that control various functions of the digestive organs. Later
studies showed that most of the gut peptides, such as [[secretin]], [[cholecystokinin]] or [[substance P]], were found to play a role of [[neurotransmitter]]s and [[neuromodulator]]s in the central and peripheral nervous systems.

Enteroendocrine cells do not form endocrine glands but are spread throughout the digestive tract. They exert their autocrine and paracrine actions that integrate all of gastrointestinal function.

==Types of Gastrointestinal hormones==
The gastrointestinal hormones can be divided into three main groups based upon their [[chemical structure]].
*''[[Gastrin family|Gastrin-cholecystokinin family]]: [[gastrin]] and [[cholecystokinin]]
*''[[Secretin family]]: [[secretin]], [[glucagon]], [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]] and [[gastric inhibitory peptide]]
*''[[Somatostatin family]]''
*''[[Motilin family]]''
* [[Substance P]].

'''[[Ghrelin]]''' is a peptide hormone released from the stomach and is often referred to as the "hunger hormone" since high levels of it are found in individuals that are fasting. Ghrelin antagonistic treatments can be used to treat illnesses such as anorexia and loss of appetites in cancer patients. Ghrelin treatments for obesity are still under intense scrutiny and no conclusive evidence has been reached. This hormone stimulates growth hormone release.

'''Cholecystokinin''' is responsible for gall bladder secretions, gastrointestinal motility as well as pancreatic exocrine secretions.

'''Peptide YY''' is involved mostly in satiation modulation.

'''Pancreatic polypeptide''' function is most apparent in control of gastrointestinal motility and satiation

'''Amylin''' controls glucose homeostasis and gastric motility

'''Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide''' possesses an acute influence on food intake through its effects on adipocytes

'''Glucagon-like peptide-1''' has an effect on incretin activity as well as satiation

'''Glucagon-like peptide-2''' is responsible for gastrointestinal motility and growth

'''Oxyntomodulin''' plays a role in controlling acid secretion and satiation
