'''Abdominal compartment syndrome''' occurs when the [[abdomen]] becomes subject to increased pressure. Specific cause of abdominal compartment syndrome is not known, although some causes can be [[sepsis]] and severe abdominal trauma. Increasing pressure reduces blood flow to abdominal organs and impairs [[pulmonary]], [[cardiovascular]], [[renal]], and gastro-intestinal (GI) function, causing [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]] and death.<ref name="findarticles.com">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3689/is_200401/ai_n9346109/</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
It occurs when tissue fluid within the [[peritoneal]] and [[retroperitoneal space]] (either [[edema]], retroperitoneal blood or free fluid in the abdomen) accumulates in such large volumes that the abdominal wall compliance threshold is crossed and the abdomen can no longer stretch. Once the abdominal wall can no longer expand, any further fluid leaking into the tissue results in fairly rapid rises in the pressure within the closed space. Initially this increase in pressure does not cause organ failure but does cause organs to not work properly - this is called intra-abdominal hypertension and is defined as a pressure over 12&nbsp;mm Hg in adults. However, if the pressure continues to rise over 20&nbsp;mm Hg and organs begin to fail, the syndrome has now progressed to the end stage highly fatal process termed abdominal compartment syndrome. These pressure measurements are relative. Small children get into trouble and develop [[compartment syndromes]] at much lower pressures while young previously healthy athletic individuals may tolerate an abdominal pressure of 20&nbsp;mm Hg very well. The diagram provided here shows more details regarding the pathophysiology of this process.
The underlying cause of the disease process is capillary permeability caused by the [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] (SIRS) that occurs in every critically ill patient. SIRS leads to leakage of fluid out of the capillary beds into the interstitial space in the entire body with a profound amount of this fluid leaking into the gut wall, mesentery and retroperitoneal tissue. (For a much more extensive discussion on the topic and physiology visit the Wikipedia section discussing intra-abdominal hypertension.)

Abdominal compartment syndrome follows a destructive pathway similar to [[compartment syndrome]] of the [[extremities]]. When increased compression occurs in such a hollow space organs will begin to collapse under the pressure. As the pressure increases and reaches a point where the [[abdomen]] can no longer be [[distended]] it starts to affect the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. When abdominal compartment syndrome reaches this point without surgery and help of a silo the patient will most likely die. There is a high mortality rate associated with abdominal compartment syndrome.<ref name="findarticles.com"/><ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/829008-overview</ref><ref>http://www.abdominalcompartmentsyndrome.com/</ref>

==Treatment==
===Non-operative medical management===
There are now multiple papers noting that early intervention using medical management for intra-abdominal hypertension can prevent abdominal compartment syndrome from occurring and can result in reduced costs of care. All of these papers suggest early detection of elevated intraabdominal pressure via bladder pressure monitoring and introduction of a treatment protocol are required for optimal results.<ref>Cheatham ML, Safcsak K.

Finally, the diagrams and algorithm provided here are useful items to assist in evaluation and management of these complex patients.

===Operative decompression===
Surgical decompression can be achieved by opening the abdominal wall and abdominal fascia anterior in order to physically create more space for the abdominal viscera. Once opened, the fascia can be bridged for support and to prevent loss of domain by a variety of medical devices ([[Bogota bag]], artificial bur, and vacuum devices using [[negative pressure wound therapy]] <ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.00953.x/abstract Fitzgerald JEF, Gupta S, Masterson S, Sigurdsson HH. Laparostomy Management using the ABTheraâ„¢ Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy System in a Grade IV Open Abdomen Secondary to Acute Pancreatitis. International Wound Journal 2012. PMID: 22487377]</ref>).
