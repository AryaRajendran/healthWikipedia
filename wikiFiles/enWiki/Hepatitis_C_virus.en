'''Hepatitis C virus''' ('''HCV''' or sometimes HVC) is a small (55–65 [[Nanometre|nm]] in size), [[viral envelope|enveloped]], [[Sense (molecular biology)#Positive-sense|positive-sense]] single-stranded [[RNA]] [[virus]] of the family ''[[Flaviviridae]]''. Hepatitis C virus is the cause of [[hepatitis C]] in humans.

==Taxonomy==

The hepatitis C virus belongs to the genus ''[[Hepacivirus]]'' a member of the family ''[[Flaviviridae]]''. Until recently it was considered to be the only member of this genus. However a member of this genus has been discovered in [[dog]]s - [[canine hepacivirus]].<ref name=Kapoor2011>{{cite journal | author = Kapoor A, Simmonds P, Gerold G, Qaisar N, Jain K, Henriquez JA, Firth C, Hirschberg DL, Rice CM ''et al.'' | year = 2011 | title = Characterization of a canine homolog of hepatitis C virus | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 108 | issue = 28| pages = 11608–11613 |bibcode = 2011PNAS..10811608K |doi = 10.1073/pnas.1101794108 }}</ref> There is also at least one virus in this genus that infects horses.<ref name=Burbelo2012>Burbelo PD, Dubovi EJ, Simmonds P, Medina JL, Henriquez JA, Mishra N, Wagner J, Tokarz R, Cullen JM, Iadarola MJ, Rice CM, Lipkin WI, Kapoor A (2012) Serology enabled discovery of genetically diverse hepaciviruses in a new host.

==Structure==
[[Image:HCV structure.png|left|thumb|Simplified diagram of the structure of the Hepatitis C virus particle]]
The  hepatitis C virus particle consists of a core of genetic material (RNA), surrounded by an [[Truncated icosahedron|icosahedral]] protective shell of [[protein]], and further encased in a lipid (fatty) envelope of cellular origin. Two viral envelope [[glycoprotein]]s, E1 and E2, are embedded in the lipid envelope.<ref name="pmid12820185">{{cite journal

==Genome==
[[Image:HCV genome.png|right|thumb|300px|Genome organisation of Hepatitis C virus]]
Hepatitis C virus has a positive sense single-stranded [[RNA]] [[genome]]. The genome consists of a single [[open reading frame]] that is 9600 [[nucleotide]] bases long.<ref name="pmid11252351">{{cite journal |author=Kato N |title=Genome of human hepatitis C virus (HCV): gene organization, sequence diversity, and variation |journal=Microb.

At  the 5' and 3' ends  of the RNA are the UTR, that are not translated into proteins but are important to translation and  replication of the viral RNA. The 5' UTR  has a [[ribosome]] binding site<ref name="pmid11497352">{{cite journal |author=Jubin R |title=Hepatitis C IRES: translating translation into a therapeutic target |journal=Curr. Opin. Mol.

Structural proteins made by the hepatitis C virus include Core protein, [[E1 (HCV)|E1]] and [[E2 (HCV)|E2]]; nonstructural proteins include [[NS2 (HCV)|NS2]], NS3, [[NS4 (HCV)|NS4]], NS4A, NS4B, [[NS5 (HCV)|NS5]], NS5A, and NS5B.

==Molecular biology==

The proteins of this virus are arranged along the genome in the following order: N terminal-core-envelope (E1)-E2-p7-nonstructural protein 2 (NS2)-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-C terminal. The mature nonstructural proteins (NS2 to NS5B) generation relies on the activity of viral proteinases.<ref name=DeFrancesco1999>{{cite journal | author = De Francesco R | year = 1999 | title = Molecular virology of the hepatitis C virus | url = | journal = J Hepatol | volume = 31 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 47–53 }}</ref> The NS2/NS3 junction is cleaved by a metal dependent autocatalytic proteinase encoded within NS2 and the N-terminus of NS3. The remaining cleavages downstream from this site are catalysed by a serine proteinase also contained within the N-terminal region of NS3. 

The core protein has 191 amino acids and can be divided into three domains on the basis of hydrophobicity: domain 1 (residues 1-117) contains mainly basic residues with two short hydrophobic regions; domain 2 (resides 118-174) is less basic and more hydrophobic and its C-terminus is at the end of p21; domain 3 (residues 175-191) is highly hydrophobic and acts as a signal sequence for E1 envelope protein.

Both envelope proteins (E1 and E2) are highly glycosylated and important in cell entry. E1 serves as the fusogenic subunit and E2 acts as the receptor binding protein. E1 has 4-5 N-linked glycans and E2 has 11 N-glycosylation sites.  

The p7 protein is dispensable for viral genome replication but plays a critical role in virus morphogenesis. This protein is a 63 amino acid membrane spanning protein which locates itself in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cleavage of p7 is mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum's signal peptidases. Two transmembrane domains of p7 are connected by a cytoplasmic loop and are oriented towards the endoplasmic reticulum's lumen.

NS2 protein is a 21-23 kiloDalton (kDa) transmembrane protein with protease activity.

NS3 is 67 kDa protein whose N-terminal has serine protease activity and whose C-terminal has NTPase/helicase activity. It is located within the endoplasmic reticulum and forms a heterodimeric complex with NS4A - a  54 amino acid membrane protein that acts as a cofactor of the proteinase. 

NS4B is a small (27 kDa) hydrophobic integral membrane protein with 4 transmembrane domains. It is located within the endoplasmic reticulum and plays an important role for recruitment of other viral proteins. It induces morphological changes to the endoplasmic reticulum forming a structure termed the membranous web.

NS5A is a hydrophilic phosphoprotein which plays an important role in viral replication, modulation of cell signaling pathways and the interferon response. It is known to bind to endoplasmic reticulum anchored human VAP proteins.<ref name=Gupta2012>{{cite journal | author = Gupta G, Qin H, Song J | year = 2012 | title = Intrinsically unstructured domain 3 of Hepatitis C virus NS5A forms a "Fuzzy Complex" with VAPB-MSP domain which carries ALS-causing mutations | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 6| page = e39261 }}</ref>  

The NS5B protein (65 kDa) is the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase. NS5B has the key function of replicating the HCV’s viral RNA by using the viral positive RNA strand as its template and catalyzes the polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTP) during RNA replication.<ref>Moradpour, D.; Penin, F.; Rice, C.M.

==Replication==

Replication of HCV involves several steps. The virus replicates mainly in the [[hepatocyte]]s of the [[liver]], where it is estimated that daily each infected cell produces approximately fifty virions (virus particles) with a calculated total of one trillion virions generated.  The virus may also replicate in [[peripheral blood mononuclear cell]]s, potentially accounting for the high levels of [[Immunology|immunological disorder]]s found in chronically infected HCV patients.  HCV has a wide variety of [[genotype]]s and mutates rapidly due to a high error rate on the part of the virus' [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]]. The mutation rate produces so many variants of the virus it is considered a [[Quasispecies model|quasispecies]] rather than a conventional virus species.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bartenschlager R, Lohmann V |title=Replication of hepatitis C virus |journal=J.

The polyprotein is then proteolytically processed by viral and cellular [[proteases]] to produce three structural (virion-associated) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins. Alternatively, a frameshift may occur in the Core region to produce an Alternate Reading Frame Protein (ARFP).<ref>{{cite pmid | 15732002}}</ref> HCV encodes two proteases, the NS2 [[cysteine]] autoprotease and the NS3-4A [[serine]] protease. The NS proteins then recruit the viral genome into an RNA replication complex, which is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic membranes. RNA replication takes places via the viral RNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] NS5B, which produces a negative strand RNA intermediate. The negative strand RNA then serves as a template for the production of new positive strand viral genomes. Nascent genomes can then be translated, further replicated or packaged within new virus particles. New virus particles are thought to bud into the secretory pathway and are released at the cell surface.

The virus replicates on intracellular [[lipid membrane]]s.<ref name=Dubuisson2002>{{cite journal | author = Dubuisson J, Penin F, Moradpour D | year = 2002 | title = Interaction of hepatitis C virus proteins with host cell membranes and lipids | url = | journal = Trends Cell Biol | volume = 12 | issue = 11| pages = 517–523 }}</ref> The [[endoplasmic reticulum]] in particular are deformed into uniquely shaped membrane structures termed 'membranous webs'.

Infection with one genotype does not confer immunity against others, and concurrent infection with two strains is possible. In most of these cases, one of the strains removes the other from the host in a short time. This finding opens the door to replace strains non-responsive to medication with others easier to treat.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Laskus T, Wang LF, Radkowski M, Vargas H, Nowicki M, Wilkinson J, Rakela J. | title = Exposure of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-positive recipients to HCV RNA-positive blood donors results in rapid predominance of a single donor strain and exclusion and/or suppression of the recipient strain | journal =  Journal of Virology| volume =  75| issue =  5| pages =  2059–66| year =  2001| pmid = 11160710 | doi =10.1128/JVI.75.5.2059-2066.2001 | pmc = 114790 }}</ref>

Once introduced to a country its spread has been influenced by many local factors including blood transfusions, vaccination programmes, intravenous drug misuse and treatment regimes. Given the reduction in the rate of spread once screening for Hepatitis C in blood products was implemented in the 1990s  it would seem that at least in recent times blood transfusion has been an important method of spreading for this virus. Additional work is required to determine the dates of evolution of the various genotypes and the timing of their spread across the globe.

Current research is focused on small-molecule inhibitors of the viral [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease]], [[RNA polymerase]] and other nonstructural genes. Two agents - [[Boceprevir]] by Merck <ref>{{cite web |publisher=FDA | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm255390.htm |title=FDA approves Victrelis for Hepatitis C |format=press release |date=May 13, 2011}}</ref> and [[Incivek|Telaprevir]] by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc - both inhibitors of NS3 protease were approved for use on May 13, 2011 and May 23, 2011 respectively.

Other agents that are under investigation include [[nucleoside]]/[[nucleotide]] analogue inhibitors and non nucleoside inhibitors of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, inhibitors of nonstructural protein 5A and host targeted compounds such as [[cyclophilin]] inhibitors and [[silibinin]].<ref name=Sarrazin2012>Sarrazin C, Hézode C, Zeuzem S, Pawlotsky JM (2012) Antiviral strategies in hepatitis C virus infection.

==Stability in the environment==
Like many viruses, the hepatitis C virus is gradually inactivated outside the body of a host. The presence of heat can have a drastic impact on the virus's lifespan outside the body. The virus can remain infectious outside a host for about sixteen days at 25°C and two days at 37°C, while it can remain active for more than six weeks at temperatures less than or equal to 4°C. When heated to temperatures of 60°C and 65°C, however, the hepatitis C virus can be inactivated in eight and four minutes, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal
