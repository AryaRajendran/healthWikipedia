==Identification of the disease and its pathogen==
[[James Augustus Grant]], in his book ''A Walk across Africa'' (1864), describes how his leg became grossly swollen and stiff with later a copious discharge. This was almost certainly the severe [[oedema]]tous form of the disease, and is the first known description of the infection{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Buruli ulcer disease was identified in 1897 by [[Albert Ruskin Cook|Sir Albert Cook]], a British physician, at [[Mengo Hospital]] in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]]. A detailed description of the disease was written in 1948 by Professor [[Peter MacCallum]] and his colleagues, who were treating patients from the [[Bairnsdale, Victoria|Bairnsdale district]], near Melbourne, [[Australia]]. They were the first to identify ''[[Mycobacterium ulcerans]]'' as the [[pathogen]] causing it. The disease was so named after Buruli County in [[Uganda]] (now called [[Nakasongola District]]), because of the many cases that occurred there in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allcountries.org/health/buruli_ulcer_disease.html |title=Buruli ulcer disease - Mycobacterium ulcerans infection |work=Health Topics A TO Z |accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref> The incidence of the disease has recently been rising in tropical Africa.

In March 2008, researchers announced the first isolation of ''M. ulcerans'' from the environment.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=A first: scientists isolate, characterize the organism that causes Buruli ulcer | date=2008-03-25 | publisher=Public Library of Science | url =http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-03/plos-afs031908.php# | work =EurekAlert! | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-27 | language = }}</ref> This indicates that the disease is transmitted via aquatic areas rather than person to person.<ref name = >{{Cite journal

==Symptoms==
[[Image:Buruli ulcer ear infant Australia.gif|thumb|Ear of an 18 month-old child with [[bacterial culture|culture]]- and [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]-confirmed Buruli ulcer who briefly visited [[St Leonards, Victoria]], [[Australia]], in 2001.]]
The infection in most instances presents as a [[wikt:subcutaneous|subcutaneous]] [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]], which is characteristically painless. In southern Australia the presentation is more often as a [[papule]] (or pimple), which is in the [[skin]] (dermis) rather than subcutaneous. The infection is mostly on the limbs, most often on exposed areas but not on the hands or feet. In children all areas may be involved, including the face or abdomen. A more severe form of infection produces diffuse swelling of a limb, which, unlike the papule or nodule, can be painful and accompanied by [[fever]]. Infection may frequently follow [[physical trauma]], often minor trauma such as a small scratch.

==Pathology==
The disease is primarily an infection of subcutaneous fat, resulting in a focus of necrotic (dead) fat containing myriads of the mycobacteria in characteristic spherules formed within the dead fat cells. [[Skin ulcer]]ation is a secondary event. The mycobacterium produces a toxin, named mycolactone, which causes this fat necrosis and inhibits an immune response. Healing may occur spontaneously but more often the disease is slowly progressive with further ulceration, granulation, scarring, and contractures. Secondary infection may occur with other nodules developing and infection may occur into bone. Although seldom fatal, the disease results in considerable morbidity and deformity.

Th1-mediated [[Immune system|immune responses]] are protective against ''M. ulcerans'' infection, whereas Th2-mediated responses are not.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of Buruli ulcer is usually based on the characteristic appearance of the ulcer in an endemic area. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, then [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] using the IS2404 target is helpful, but this is not specific for ''M. ulcerans''. The [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]] is only 40&ndash;80% sensitive, and culture is 20&ndash;60% sensitive.  Simultaneous use of multiple methods may be necessary to make the diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Herbinger K-H, Adjei O, Awua‐Boateng N-Y, ''et al.''|title=Comparative study of the sensitivity of different diagnostic methods for the laboratory diagnosis of Buruli ulcer disease|journal=Clin Infect Dis|year=2009|volume=48|pages=1055&ndash;1064|doi=10.1086/597398|pmid=19275499|issue=8}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment is by [[Surgery|surgical excision]] (removal) of the lesion, which may be only a minor operation and very successful if undertaken early. Advanced disease may require prolonged treatment with extensive skin grafting. Surgical practice can be dangerous and scarcely available in affected third world countries.

Antibiotics currently play little part in the treatment of Buruli ulcer. The [[World Health Organisation|WHO]] currently recommend [[rifampicin]] and [[streptomycin]] for eight weeks in the hope of reducing the need for surgery. The combination of rifampicin and [[clarithromycin]] has been used for many years in Australia{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Rifampicin must never be used alone because the bacterium quickly becomes resistant.

There are a number of experimental treatments currently being investigated:
* [[Sitafloxacin]] and [[rifampicin]] is a synergistic combination that has only been trialled in mice.
* [[Rifalazil]] is a [[rifamycin]] antibiotic that appears to be more potent than [[rifampicin]] that has only been trialled in mice.
* [[Epiroprim]] and [[dapsone]] are synergistic when used in combination (''in vitro'' studies only at present)
* [[Diarylquinoline]] shows high potency ''in vitro''
* Application of [[Montmorillonite|French clay]].<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071025120514.htm French Clay Can Kill MRSA And 'Flesh-Eating' Bacteria<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In a small series of eight patients, local heat at 40°C led to complete healing without surgery (except the initial removal of dead tissue).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meyers WM, Shelly WM, Connor DH |title=Heat treatment of Mycobacterium ulcerans infections without surgical excision |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=924–9 |year=1974 |month=September |pmid=4451233 |doi= |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=4451233}}</ref>

==Prevention==

[[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin]] vaccine is said to prevent this kind of disease.

==Global spread==
[[File:Buruli ulcer map 2009.png|thumb|Map with number of reported cases of Buruli ulcer in 2009.]]
The infection occurs in well defined areas throughout the world, mostly tropical areas - in several areas in Australia, in Uganda, in several countries in [[West Africa]], in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], in [[southeast Asia]] and [[New Guinea]]. It is steadily rising as a serious disease, especially in West Africa and underdeveloped countries, where it is the third leading cause of mycobacterial infection in healthy people, after tuberculosis and leprosy. In East Africa, thousands of cases occur annually and in these areas the disease has displaced leprosy to become the second most important mycobacterial disease of man (after tuberculosis).

The disease is more likely to occur where there have been environmental changes such as the development of water storages, sand mining and irrigation.

Buruli ulcer is currently endemic in the Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo.<ref name="statistics1">WHO, (2000) Buruli ulcer: Mycobacterium ulcerans infection. Geneva</ref> In Ghana, 1999 data indicated that the prevalence rate of the disease in the Ga West District was 87.7 per 100,000, higher than the estimated national prevalence rate at 20.7 per 100,000 generally, and 150.8 per 100,000 in the most disease-endemic districts.<ref name="statistics2">Amofah, G.K., Bonsu, F., Tetteh, C., Okrah, J., Asamoa, K., Asiedu, K. and Addy, J.
