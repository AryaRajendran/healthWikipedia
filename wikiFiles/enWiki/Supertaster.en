A '''supertaster''' is a person who experiences the sense of [[taste]] with far greater intensity than average. Some 35% of women and 15% of men are supertasters.<ref>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-173160/Women-better-taste.html</ref> Supertasters are more likely to be of Asian, African, and South American descent.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/body/articles/senses/supertaster.shtml Science of supertasters] BBC</ref> The cause of this heightened response is currently unknown, although it is thought to be related to the presence of the TAS2R38 gene, the ability to taste [[Propylthiouracil|PROP]] and [[Phenylthiocarbamide|PTC]], and at least in part, due to an increased number of [[fungiform papillae]].<ref>Bartoshuk, L. M., V. B. Duffy, ''et al.'' (1994). "PTC/PROP tasting: anatomy, psychophysics, and sex effects." 1994. ''Physiol Behav'' 56(6): 1165–71.</ref> Any evolutionary advantage to supertasting is unclear. In some environments, heightened taste response, particularly to bitterness, would represent an important advantage in avoiding potentially toxic plant alkaloids. In other environments, increased response to bitterness may have limited the range of palatable foods.  It may be a cause of [[Selective eating disorder|picky eating]], but picky eaters are not necessarily supertasters, and vice versa.

The term originates with experimental psychologist [[Linda Bartoshuk]] who has spent much of her career studying genetic variation in taste perception. In the early 1990s, Bartoshuk and her colleagues noticed some individuals tested in the laboratory seemed to have an elevated taste response and took to calling them supertasters.<ref>Bartoshuk, L. M. (1991). "Sweetness: History, Preference, and Genetic Variability." Food Technol. 45(11): 108,110, 112–113.</ref> This increased taste response is not the result of [[response bias]] or a scaling artifact, but appears to have an anatomical/biological basis.

==History==
In 1931, A.L. Fox, a [[DuPont]] chemist, discovered that some individuals found [[phenylthiocarbamide]] (PTC) to be bitter while others found it tasteless.<ref>Fox AF. Six in ten "tasteblind" to bitter chemical. ''Sci News Lett'' 1931;9:249.</ref><ref name="Bartoshuk 2000">Bartoshuk, L. M. (2000). "Psychophysical advances aid the study of genetic variation in taste." Appetite 34(1): 105.</ref> At the 1931 meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], Fox collaborated with Blakeslee (a geneticist) to have attendees taste PTC: 65% found it bitter, 28% found it tasteless and 6% described other taste qualities. Subsequent work revealed that the ability to taste PTC was genetic in nature. In the 1960s, [[Roland L. Fischer|Roland Fischer]] was the first to link the ability to taste PTC, and the related compound [[propylthiouracil]] (PROP), to food preference and body type. Today, PROP has replaced PTC in taste research due to a faint sulfurous odor and safety concerns with PTC. As described above, Bartoshuk and colleagues discovered that the taster group could be further divided into medium and supertasters. Most estimates suggest 25% of the population are nontasters, 50% are medium tasters, and 25% are supertasters.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roxby|first=Philippa|title=Why taste is all in the senses|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20640337|newspaper=BBC News Health|date=9 December 2012}}</ref>

==Identifying a supertaster==
[[File:Blue tongue.jpg|thumb|150px|Tongue's fungiform papillae revealed with blue food dye.]]
Supertasters were initially identified on the basis of the perceived intensity of [[propylthiouracil]] (PROP) compared to a reference salt solution. However, because supertasters have a larger sense of taste than medium or nontasters, this can cause [[scaling artifact]]s.<ref name="Bartoshuk 2000"/> Subsequently, salt has been replaced with a non-oral auditory standard. That is, if two individuals rate the same physical stimulus at a comparable perceptual intensity, but one gives a rating twice as large for the bitterness of a PROP solution, the experimenter can be confident the difference is real and not merely the result of how the person is using the scale.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Many studies do not include a cross-modal reference and simply categorize individuals on the basis of the bitterness of a concentrated PROP solution<ref>Prescott, J., N. Ripandelli, ''et al.'' (2001). "Binary taste mixture interactions in prop non-tasters, medium-tasters and super-tasters." Chem Senses 26(8): 993–1003.</ref><ref name="Lanier 2005">Lanier, SA, JE Hayes, VB Duffy. (2005). "Sweet and bitter tastes of alcoholic beverages mediate alcohol intake in of-age undergraduates." Physiology & Behavior 83(5): 821–831.</ref> or PROP impregnated paper.<ref>Sipiora, M. L., M. A. Murtugh, ''et al.'' (2000). "Bitter taste perception and severe vomiting in pregnancy." Physiol Behav 69(3): 259–67.</ref> It is also possible to make a reasonably accurate [[self-diagnosis]] at home by careful examination of the tongue and looking for the number of [[fungiform papillae]]{{Cn|date=March 2013}}.  Blue food dye can make this easier.  Being a supertaster or nontaster represents normal variation in the human population like eye or hair color, so no treatment is needed.

==Specific food sensitivities==
Although individual food preference for supertasters cannot be typified, documented examples for either lessened preference or consumption include:

* Certain [[alcoholic beverage]]s<ref name="Lanier 2005"/>
* ''[[Brassica oleracea]]'' cultivars

Other foods may also show altered patterns of preference and consumption, but only indirect evidence exists:
* [[Chili pepper]]s – [[Capsaicin]] burn is more intense in supertasters
* [[Tonic water]] – [[Quinine]] is more bitter to supertasters
* [[Olive]]s – for a given concentration, salt is more intense in supertasters
