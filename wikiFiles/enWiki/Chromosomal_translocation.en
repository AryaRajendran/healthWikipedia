[[File:Translocation-4-20.png|thumb|Chromosomal reciprocal translocation of the 4th and 20th [[chromosome]].]]
In [[genetics]], a '''chromosome translocation''' is a [[chromosome abnormality]] caused by rearrangement of parts between nonhomologous [[chromosomes]]. A gene fusion may be created when the translocation joins two otherwise separated genes, the occurrence of which is common in [[cancer]]. It is detected on [[cytogenetics]] or a [[karyotype]] of affected [[cell (biology)|cells]].  There are two main types, '''reciprocal''' (also known as non-Robertsonian) and '''Robertsonian'''.  Also, translocations can be '''balanced''' (in an even exchange of material with no genetic information extra or missing, and ideally full functionality) or '''unbalanced''' (where the exchange of [[chromosome]] material is unequal resulting in extra or missing [[gene]]s).

==Reciprocal (non-Robertsonian) translocations==
Reciprocal translocations are usually an exchange of material between nonhomologous chromosomes. Estimates of incidence range from about 1 in 500 <ref>{{cite journal | author = Caroline Mackie Ogilvie and Paul N Scriven | year = 2002 | month = December| title = Meiotic outcomes in reciprocal translocation carriers ascertained in 3-day human embryos | journal = [[European Journal of Human Genetics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pmid = 12461686 | pages = 801–806 | publisher = [[European Society of Human Genetics]] | url = http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v10/n12/full/5200895a.html | accessdate = 2008-12-26 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200895}}</ref> to 1 in 625 human newborns.<ref>{{cite journal | author = M.

However, carriers of balanced reciprocal translocations have increased risks of creating gametes with unbalanced chromosome translocations leading to miscarriages or children with abnormalities.  [[Genetic counseling]] and [[genetic testing]] are often offered to families that may carry a translocation. Most balanced translocation carriers are healthy and do not have any symptoms. But about 6% of them have a range of symptoms which may include autism, intellectual disability, or congenital anomalies. A gene disrupted or disregulated at the breakpoint of the translocation carrier is likely the cause of these symptoms. 

It is important to distinguish between chromosomal translocations occurring in gametogenesis, due to errors in [[meiosis]], and translocations which occur in cellular division of somatic cells, due to errors in [[mitosis]]. The former results in a chromosomal abnormality featured in all cells of the offspring, as in translocation carriers. Somatic translocations, on the other hand, result in abnormalities featured only in the affected cell line, as in [[Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia]] with the [[Philadelphia Chromosome]] translocation.

==Robertsonian translocations==
{{Main|Robertsonian translocation}}
This type of rearrangement involves two [[Centromere#Acrocentric|acrocentric]] chromosomes that fuse near the [[centromere]] region with loss of the short arms.  The resulting [[karyotype]] in humans leaves only 45 chromosomes since two chromosomes have fused together.  This has no direct effect on the phenotype since the only genes on the short arms of acrocentrics are common to all of them and are present in variable copy number (nucleolar organiser genes). [[Robertsonian translocation]]s have been seen involving all combinations of acrocentric chromosomes. The most common translocation in humans involves chromosomes [[chromosome 13 (human)|13]] and [[chromosome 14 (human)|14]] and is seen in about 0.97 / 1000 newborns.<ref>{{cite journal | author = E. Anton | coauthors = J. Blanco, J. Egozcue, F. Vidal | date = April 29, 2004 | title = Sperm FISH studies in seven male carriers of Robertsonian translocation t(13;14)(q10;q10) | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 1345–1351 | publisher = Oxford University Press | issn = 1460-2350 | pmid = 15117905 | url = http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/19/6/1345 | accessdate = 2008-12-25 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/deh232}}</ref> Carriers of Robertsonian translocations are not associated with any phenotypic abnormalities, but there is a risk of unbalanced gametes which lead to miscarriages or abnormal offspring.  For example, carriers of Robertsonian translocations involving [[chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome 21]] have a higher chance of having a child with [[Down syndrome]]. This is known as a 'translocation Downs'. This is due to a mis-segregation ([[nondisjunction]]) during gametogenesis. The mother has a higher (10%) risk of transmission than the father (1%). Robertsonian translocations involving chromosome 14 also carry a slight risk of [[uniparental disomy]] 14 due to [[trisomy rescue]].

==Role in disease==
Some human diseases caused by translocations are:
* [[Cancer]]: several forms of cancer are caused by acquired translocations (as opposed to those present from conception); this has been described mainly in [[leukemia]] ([[acute myelogenous leukemia]] and [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]]). Translocations have also been described in solid malignancies such as [[Ewing's sarcoma]].
* [[Infertility]]: one of the would-be parents carries a ''balanced translocation'', where the parent is asymptomatic but conceived fetuses are not viable.
* [[Down syndrome]] is caused in a minority (5% or less) of cases by a Robertsonian translocation of the [[chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome 21]] long arm onto  the long arm of [[chromosome 14 (human)|chromosome 14]].<ref>http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Downs-syndrome/Pages/Causes.aspx</ref>

===Denotation===
The International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) is used to denote a translocation between [[chromosome]]s.<ref>Schaffer, Lisa. (2005) ''International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature'' S. Karger AG ISBN 978-3-8055-8019-9</ref>  The designation '''t(A;B)(p1;q2)''' is used to denote a translocation between [[chromosome]] A and chromosome B. The information in the second set of parentheses, when given, gives the precise location within the chromosome for chromosomes A and B respectively&mdash;with ''p'' indicating the short arm of the chromosome, ''q'' indicating the long arm, and the numbers after p or q refers to regions, bands and subbands seen when staining the chromosome with a [[staining dye]]. See also the definition of a [[locus (genetics)|genetic locus]].

==History==
In 1938 [[Karl Sax]], at the [[Harvard University]] Biological Laboratories, published a paper entitled "Chromosome Aberrations Induced by X-rays," which demonstrated that [[radiation]] could induce major [[Genetics|genetic]] changes by affecting chromosomal translocations. The paper is thought to mark the beginning of the field of radiation cytology, and led him to be called "the father of radiation cytology".
