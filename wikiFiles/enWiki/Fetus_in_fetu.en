'''''Fetus in fetu''''' (or '''''foetus in foetu''''') is a [[developmental abnormality]] in which a mass of tissue resembling a [[fetus]] forms inside the body. There are two theories of origin concerning "fetus in fetu". One theory is that the mass begins as a normal fetus but becomes enveloped inside its [[twin]].<ref name="Chua">{{cite journal | last =Chua | first =JHY | authorlink = | coauthors =Chui CH, Sai Prasad TR et al. | title =Fetus-in-fetu in the pelvis |journal =Annals of the Academy of Medicine Singapore | volume =34 | issue = | pages =646–9 | publisher = | year =2005 | url =http://annals.edu.sg/pdf/34VolNo10200511/V34N10p646.pdf |format=PDF| doi = | id = | accessdate = }}</ref>  The other theory is that the mass is a highly developed [[teratoma]].

==Classification as life==
A ''fetus in fetu'' can be considered alive, but only in the sense that its component tissues have not yet died or been eliminated.  Thus, the life of a ''fetus in fetu'' is akin to that of a [[tumor]] in that its cells remain viable by way of normal metabolic activity.  However, without the gestational conditions ''in [[uterus|utero]]'' with the [[amnion]] and [[placenta]], a ''fetus in fetu'' can develop into, at best, an especially well [[wikt:differentiation|differentiated]] [[teratoma]]; or, at worst, a high-grade [[metastatic]] [[teratocarcinoma]]. In terms of physical maturation, its organs have a working blood supply from the host, but all cases of ''fetus in fetu'' present critical defects, such as no functional brain, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary tract.  Accordingly, while a ''fetus in fetu'' can share select [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features with a normal fetus, it has no prospect of any life outside of the host twin.  Moreover, it poses clear threats to the life of the host twin on whom its own life depends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/2/1/2 |title=Journal of Medical Case Reports &#124; Full text &#124; Fetus in fetu : a case report |publisher=Jmedicalcasereports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref>

==Theories of development==
There are two main theories about the development of fetus in fetu; one simple, the other complex.

===Teratoma theory===
{{main|Teratoma}}

Fetus in fetu may be a very highly differentiated form of [[dermoid cyst]], itself a highly differentiated form of [[teratoma|mature teratoma]].<ref name="Basu">{{cite journal |author=Basu A, Jagdish S, Iyengar KR, Basu D |title=Fetus in fetu or differentiated teratomas? |journal=Indian J Pathol Microbiol |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=563–5 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17183856 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Parasitic twin theory===
{{main|Parasitic twin}}

Fetus in fetu may be a [[parasitic twin]] [[fetus]] growing within his or her [[host (biology)|host]] [[twin]].  Very early in a [[monozygotic]] twin pregnancy, in which both fetuses share a common placenta, one fetus wraps around and envelops the other. The enveloped twin becomes a [[parasite]], in that his or her survival depends on the survival of his or her host twin, by drawing on the host twin's blood supply. The parasitic twin is [[anencephalic]] (without a [[Human brain|brain]]) and lacks some [[internal organ]]s, and as such is almost always unable to survive on its own. As the normal twin has to "feed" the enveloped twin from the nutrients received over a single umbilical cord, he or she usually dies before birth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Examples from history and in the media==
An early example of the phenomenon was described in 1808 by George William Young. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2128792/pdf/medcht00073-0262.pdf |title=Case of A Foetus found in the Abdomen of a Boy |author=George William Young |date=1608 |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.gov |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref>

Cases of fetus in fetu sometimes attract worldwide media attention.  These cases are a small minority of the known cases and rarely overlap with cases reported in the medical literature, but they are widely accessible.
*Aimee Sevilla Stanford Hospital 1990.

*Marina Miliou of Greece in April 1990.

*In June 1999, the case of '''Sanju Bhagat''' a man from [[Nagpur]], [[India]] attracted attention for the length of time (36 years) he had carried his parasitic "twin" inside his body, and the size of the growth. As Bhagat had no [[placenta]], the growth had connected directly to his blood supply.<ref name="abc1">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2346476&page=1 |title=Man With Twin Living Inside Him - A Medical Mystery Classic - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-08-23 |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref>

*'''Alamjan Nematilaev''' was the surviving host of a fetus in fetu. In 2003, aged 7, his school [[physician]] in [[Kazakhstan]] referred him to a hospital after movements were detected in the boy's enlarged abdomen. An operation intended to remove a [[cyst]] uncovered the fetus of Alamjan's identical twin brother, which had lived as parasitic growth inside the boy throughout his entire life. The fetus was comparatively highly developed, with [[hair]], arms, fingers, nails, legs, toes, genitals, a head, and a vague approximation of a face.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alok Jha |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/thisweek/story/0,12977,999292,00.html |title=How did that boy end up with his twin growing inside him? &#124; Science |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/S/science/medicine/bodyshock.html |title=Science, Nature and the Environment |publisher=Channel 4 |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref>
