'''Hydrocephalus''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|h|aɪ|d|r|ɵ|ˈ|s|ɛ|f|ə|l|ə|s}}), also known as "water on the brain," is a medical condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) in the [[ventricular system|ventricles]], or cavities, of the [[brain]]. This may cause increased [[intracranial pressure]] inside the [[human skull|skull]] and progressive enlargement of the head, convulsion, [[tunnel vision]], and mental disability. Hydrocephalus can also cause death. The name derives from the Greek words ὑδρο- (hydro-) "water", and κέφαλος (kephalos) "head".

==Signs and symptoms==
{{main|intracranial pressure|normal pressure hydrocephalus}}
The clinical presentation of hydrocephalus varies with chronicity. Acute dilatation of the ventricular system is more likely to manifest with the nonspecific signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. By contrast chronic dilatation (especially in the elderly population) may have a more insidious onset presenting, for instance, with [[Hakim's triad]] (Adams triad).

Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure may include [[headache]]s, [[vomiting]], [[nausea]], [[papilledema]], [[somnolence|sleepiness]] or [[coma]]. Elevated [[intracranial pressure]] may result in [[temporal lobe|uncal]] and/or [[cerebellum|cerebellar tonsill]] herniation, with resulting life threatening [[brain stem]] compression.

Hakim's triad of gait instability, [[urinary incontinence]] and [[dementia]] is a relatively typical manifestation of the distinct entity [[normal pressure hydrocephalus]] (NPH).  Focal neurological deficits may also occur, such as [[abducens nerve]] palsy and vertical [[gaze palsy]] ([[Parinaud syndrome]] due to compression of the [[quadrigeminal plate]], where the neural centers coordinating the conjugated vertical eye movement are located). The symptoms depend on the cause of the blockage, the person's age, and how much brain tissue has been damaged by the swelling.

In infants with hydrocephalus, CSF builds up in the central nervous system, causing the fontanelle (soft spot) to bulge and the head to be larger than expected. Early symptoms may also include:
[[File:Hydrocephalus-baby.jpg|thumb|float|right|200px|An infant with severe hydrocephalus.]]  
* Eyes that appear to gaze downward
* Irritability
* Seizures
* Separated sutures
* Sleepiness
* Vomiting

Symptoms that may occur in older children can include:

* Brief, shrill, high-pitched cry
* Changes in personality, memory, or the ability to reason or think
* Changes in facial appearance and eye spacing
* Crossed eyes or uncontrolled eye movements
* Difficulty feeding
* Excessive sleepiness
* Headache
* Irritability, poor temper control
* Loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence)
* Loss of coordination and trouble walking
* Muscle spasticity (spasm)
* Slow growth (child 0–5 years)
* Slow or restricted movement
* Vomiting <ref title= Hydrocephalus: MedLinePlus Medical Encyclopeda>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001571.htm Accessed 19 June 2010</ref>

In 1881, a few years after the landmark study of [[Gustaf Retzius|Retzius]] and Key, [[Carl Wernicke]] pioneered sterile ventricular puncture and external CSF drainage for the treatment of hydrocephalus.<ref>"[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10547004 The scientific history of hydrocephalus and its treatment.]". [[United States National Library of Medicine]].</ref> It remained an intractable condition until the 20th century, when [[cerebral shunt|shunts]] and other [[neurosurgical]] treatment modalities were developed. It is a lesser-known medical condition; relatively small amounts of research are conducted to improve treatments for hydrocephalus, and to this day there remains no cure for the condition. In developing countries, it is common that this condition go untreated at birth. It is difficult to diagnose during ante-natal care and access medical treatment is limited. However, when head swelling is prominent, children are taken at great expense for treatment. By then brain tissue is undeveloped and neurosurgery is rare and difficult. Children more commonly live with undeveloped brain tissue and consequential mental retardation.

==Pathology==

Hydrocephalus is usually due to blockage of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) outflow in the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]] or in the [[subarachnoid space]] over the brain. In a person without hydrocephalus, CSF continuously circulates through the brain, its ventricles and the [[spinal cord]] and is continuously drained away into the circulatory system. Alternatively, the condition may result from an overproduction of the CSF, from a [[congenital malformation]] blocking normal drainage of the fluid, or from complications of [[head injuries]] or infections.<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hydrocephalus/detail_hydrocephalus.htm "Hydrocephalus Fact Sheet"], National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. (August 2005).</ref>

Compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually may cause neurological symptoms such as [[convulsions]], [[mental retardation]] and epileptic seizures.  These signs occur sooner in adults, whose skulls are no longer able to expand to accommodate the increasing fluid volume within.  Fetuses, infants, and young children with hydrocephalus typically have an abnormally large head, excluding the face, because the pressure of the fluid causes the individual skull bones — which have yet to fuse — to bulge outward at their [[juncture points]].  Another [[medical sign]], in infants,  is a characteristic fixed downward gaze with whites of the eyes showing above the iris, as though the infant were trying to examine its own lower eyelids.<ref>Cabot, Richard C. (1919) ''Physical diagnosis'' , William Wood and company, New York, 7th edition, 527 pages, page 5. (Google Books)</ref>

The elevated intracranial pressure may cause compression of the brain, leading to brain damage and other complications. Conditions among affected individuals vary widely.  

If the [[foramina]] of the [[fourth ventricle]] or the [[cerebral aqueduct]] are blocked, cereobrospinal fluid (CSF) can accumulate within the ventricles. This condition is called '''internal hydrocephalus''' and it results in increased CSF pressure. The production of CSF continues, even when the passages that normally allow it to exit the brain are blocked. Consequently, fluid builds inside the brain causing pressure that dilates the ventricles and compresses the [[nervous tissue]]. Compression of the nervous tissue usually results in [[irreversible brain damage]]. If the [[human skull|skull]] bones are not completely [[ossified]] when the hydrocephalus occurs, the pressure may also severely enlarge the head. The cerebral aqueduct may be blocked at the time of [[birth]] or may become blocked later in life because of a [[tumor]] growing in the [[brainstem]].

Internal hydrocephalus can be successfully treated by placing a drainage tube (shunt) between the brain ventricles and abdominal cavity to eliminate the high intracranial pressure. There is some risk of [[infection]] being introduced into the brain through these shunts, however, and the shunts must be replaced as the person grows. A subarachnoid hemorrhage may block the return of CSF to the circulation. 

This should be distinguished from '''external hydrocephalus'''. This is a condition generally seen in infants and involving enlarged fluid spaces or [[subarachnoid space]]s around the outside of the brain. This is generally a [[benign]] condition that resolves spontaneously by 2 years of age. (Greenberg, Handbook of Neurosurgery, 5th Edition, pg 174).<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=0TC9Cns4Qz8C&pg=PA307&lpg=PA307&dq=Greenberg+handbook+of+neurosurgery+external+hydrocephalus#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Handbook of Neurosurgery | isbn = 9781604063264 | author1 = Greenberg | first1 = Mark S | date = 2010-02-15}}</ref> Imaging studies and a good medical history can help to differentiate external hydrocephalus from [[subdural hematoma|subdural hemorrhages]] or symptomatic chronic extra-axial fluid collections which are accompanied by [[vomiting]], [[headaches]] and [[seizures]].

==Classification==

Hydrocephalus can be caused by impaired [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) flow, reabsorption, or excessive CSF production.  

*The most common cause of hydrocephalus is CSF flow [[wikt:obstruction|obstruction]], hindering the free passage of cerebrospinal fluid through the ventricular system and [[subarachnoid space]] (e.g., [[stenosis]] of the [[cerebral aqueduct]] or obstruction of the [[interventricular foramina (neural anatomy)|interventricular foramina]] - '''foramina of Monro''' secondary to [[tumor]]s, [[hemorrhage]]s, [[infection]]s or [[congenital]] malformations).
*Hydrocephalus can also be caused by overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid (relative obstruction) (e.g., papilloma of choroid plexus).
*Bilateral ureteric obstruction is a rare, but reported, cause of hydrocephalus.

Based on its underlying mechanisms, hydrocephalus can be classified into '''communicating''' and '''non-communicating''' (obstructive).  Both forms can be either '''congenital''' or '''acquired'''.

===Communicating===

'''Communicating hydrocephalus''', also known as '''non-obstructive hydrocephalus''', is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid resorption in the absence of any CSF-flow obstruction between the ventricles and subarachnoid space. It has been theorized that this is due to functional impairment of the [[arachnoid villi|arachnoidal granulations]] (also called arachnoid granulations or '''Pacchioni's granulations'''), which are located along the [[superior sagittal sinus]] and is the site of  cerebrospinal fluid resorption back into the venous system. Various neurologic conditions may result in communicating hydrocephalus, including subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage, [[meningitis]] and congenital absence of arachnoid villi. Scarring and fibrosis of the [[subarachnoid space]] following infectious, inflammatory, or hemorrhagic events can also prevent resorption of CSF, causing diffuse ventricular dilatation.

*'''[[Normal pressure hydrocephalus]]''' (NPH) is a particular form of '''communicating hydrocephalus''', characterized by enlarged cerebral ventricles, with only intermittently elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The diagnosis of NPH can be established only with the help of continuous intraventricular pressure recordings (over 24 hours or even longer), since more often than not instant measurements yield normal pressure values. Dynamic compliance studies may be also helpful.  Altered compliance (elasticity) of the ventricular walls, as well as increased [[viscosity]] of the cerebrospinal fluid, may play a role in the pathogenesis of normal pressure hydrocephalus.
*'''''Hydrocephalus ex vacuo''''' also refers to an enlargement of cerebral ventricles and subarachnoid spaces, and is usually due to '''brain [[atrophy]]''' (as it occurs in [[dementia]]s), post-[[traumatic brain injury|traumatic brain injuries]] and even in some psychiatric disorders, such as [[schizophrenia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} As opposed to hydrocephalus, this is a '''compensatory enlargement''' of the CSF-spaces in response to '''brain [[parenchyma]] loss''' - it '''is not''' the result of increased CSF pressure.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Non-communicating===

Non-communicating hydrocephalus, or '''obstructive hydrocephalus''', is caused by a CSF-flow obstruction ultimately preventing CSF from flowing into the subarachnoid space (either due to external compression or intraventricular mass lesions). 
*'''[[Interventricular foramina (neural anatomy)|Foramen of Monro]]''' obstruction may lead to dilation of one or, if large enough (e.g., in [[Colloid cyst]]), both lateral ventricles.
*'''The [[Cerebral aqueduct|aqueduct of Sylvius]]''', normally narrow to begin with, may be obstructed by a number of genetically or acquired lesions (e.g., atresia, ependymitis, hemorrhage, tumor) and lead to dilation of both lateral ventricles as well as the third ventricle.
*'''[[Fourth ventricle]]''' obstruction will lead to dilatation of the aqueduct as well as the lateral and third ventricles (e.g., [[Chiari malformation]]).
*'''The [[foramina of Luschka]] and [[Median aperture|foramen of Magendie]]''' may be obstructed due to congenital failure of opening (e.g., [[Dandy-Walker malformation]]).

===Congenital===
{{Main|Arnold-Chiari malformation|Dandy-Walker malformation}}

The cranial bones fuse by the end of the third year of life. For head enlargement to occur, hydrocephalus must occur before then. The causes are usually genetic but can also be acquired and usually occur within the first few months of life, which include 1) intraventricular matrix hemorrhages in premature infants, 2) infections, 3) type II [[Arnold-Chiari malformation]], 4) aqueduct atresia and stenosis, and 5) Dandy-Walker malformation. 

In newborns and toddlers with hydrocephalus, the head circumference is enlarged rapidly and soon surpasses the 97th percentile. Since the skull bones have not yet firmly joined together, bulging, firm anterior and posterior fontanelles may be present even when the patient is in an upright position. 

The infant exhibits   fretfulness, poor feeding, and frequent vomiting. As the hydrocephalus progresses, torpor sets in, and the infant shows lack of interest in his surroundings. Later on, the upper eyelids become retracted and the eyes are turned downwards (due to hydrocephalic pressure on the mesencephalic tegmentum and paralysis of upward gaze). Movements become weak and the arms may become tremulous. Papilledema is absent but there may be reduction of vision. The head becomes so enlarged that the child may eventually be bedridden.

About 80-90% of fetuses or newborn infants with [[spina bifida]]—often associated with [[meningocele]] or [[myelomeningocele]]—develop hydrocephalus.<ref>[http://www.spinabifidamoms.com/english/about.html wwww.spinabifidamoms.com]</ref>

===Acquired===

This condition is acquired as a consequence of CNS [[infections]], [[meningitis]], [[brain tumors]], [[traumatic brain injury|head trauma]], [[stroke|intracranial hemorrhage]] (subarachnoid or intraparenchymal) and is usually extremely painful.

==Effects==

Because hydrocephalus can injure the brain, thought and behavior may be adversely affected.  [[Learning disability|Learning disabilities]] including short-term memory loss are common among those with hydrocephalus, who tend to score better on verbal IQ than on performance IQ, which is thought to reflect the distribution of nerve damage to the brain. However the severity of hydrocephalus can differ considerably between individuals and some are of average or above-average intelligence. Someone with hydrocephalus may have motion and visual problems, problems with coordination, or may be clumsy. They may reach puberty earlier than the average child (see [[precocious puberty]]). About one in four develops [[epilepsy]].

==Treatment==

Hydrocephalus [[Therapy|treatment]] is surgical, generally creating various types of [[cerebral shunt]]s. It involves the placement of a ventricular [[catheter]] (a tube made of [[silastic]]), into the [[ventricle (brain)|cerebral ventricles]] to bypass the flow obstruction/malfunctioning [[arachnoid villi|arachnoidal granulations]] and drain the excess fluid into other body cavities, from where it can be resorbed. Most shunts drain the fluid into the [[peritoneum|peritoneal cavity]] ([[cerebral shunt|ventriculo-peritoneal shunt]]), but alternative sites include the [[right atrium]] ([[cerebral shunt|ventriculo-atrial shunt]]), [[pleura|pleural cavity]] ([[cerebral shunt|ventriculo-pleural shunt]]), and [[gallbladder]]. A shunt system can also be placed in the lumbar space of the spine and have the CSF redirected to the [[peritoneal cavity]] ([[Lumbar-peritoneal shunt]]). An alternative treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus in selected patients is the [[endoscopic third ventriculostomy]] (ETV), whereby a surgically created opening in the floor of the third ventricle allows the CSF to flow directly to the basal cisterns, thereby shortcutting any obstruction, as in [[aqueductal stenosis]]. This may or may not be appropriate based on individual anatomy.

===Shunt complications===

Examples of possible complications include shunt malfunction, shunt failure, and shunt infection, along with infection of the shunt tract following surgery (the most common reason for shunt failure is infection of the shunt tract). Although a shunt generally works well, it may stop working if it disconnects, becomes blocked (clogged), infected, or it is outgrown. If this happens the cerebrospinal fluid will begin to accumulate again and a number of physical symptoms will develop (headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia/light sensitivity), some extremely serious, like [[seizure]]s. The shunt failure rate is also relatively high (of the 40,000 surgeries performed annually to treat hydrocephalus, only 30% are a patient's first surgery)<ref>http://www.hydroassoc.org/media/stats</ref> and it is not uncommon for patients to have multiple shunt revisions within their lifetime.

The diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid buildup is complex and requires specialist expertise.

Another complication can occur when CSF drains more rapidly than it is produced by the [[choroid plexus]], causing symptoms -listlessness, severe [[headaches]], [[irritability]], [[light sensitivity]], auditory [[hyperesthesia]] (sound sensitivity), [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[dizziness]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[migraines]], [[seizures]], a change in personality, [[weakness]] in the arms or legs,  [[strabismus]], and [[Diplopia|double vision]] - to appear when the patient is vertical. If the patient lies down, the symptoms usually vanish in a short amount of time. A [[CT scan]] may or may not show any change in ventricle size, particularly if the patient has a history of slit-like ventricles. Difficulty in diagnosing overdrainage can make treatment of this complication particularly frustrating for patients and their families.

Resistance to traditional [[analgesic]] pharmacological therapy may also be a sign of shunt overdrainage ''or'' failure. Diagnosis of the particular complication usually depends on when the symptoms appear - that is, whether symptoms occur when the patient is upright or in a prone position, with the head at roughly the same level as the feet.

==Shunts in developing countries==

Since the cost of shunt systems is beyond the reach of most people in developing countries, most people with hydrocephalus die without even getting a shunt. Worse is the rate of revision in shunt systems that adds to the cost of shunting many times. Looking at this point, a study done by Dr. Benjamin C. Warf compares different shunt systems and highlighting the role of low cost shunt systems in most of the developing countries. This study has been published in ''Journal of [[Neurosurgery]]: Pediatrics'' May 2005 issue.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Comparison of 1-year outcomes for the Chhabra and Codman-Hakim Micro Precision shunt systems in Uganda: a prospective study in 195 children|journal=J Neurosurg (Pediatrics 4)|year=2005|first=Benjamin C.|last=Warf|coauthors=|volume=102|issue=4 Suppl|pages=358–362|doi= 10.3171/ped.2005.102.4.0358|url=http://thejns.org|pmid=15926385}} http://thejns.org/doi/pdf/10.3171/ped.2005.102.4.0358</ref> It is about comparing Chhabra shunt system to those of the shunt systems from developed countries. The study was done in [[Uganda]] and the shunts were donated by the International Federation for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus.

==Exceptional case==
{{main|Dandy-Walker syndrome}}
One interesting case involving a person with past hydrocephalus was a 44-year-old [[France|French]] man, whose brain had been reduced to little more than a thin sheet of actual brain tissue, due to the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in his head. The man, who had had a shunt inserted into his head to drain away fluid (which was removed when he was 14), went to a hospital after he had been experiencing mild weakness in his left leg.

In July 2007, ''Fox News'' quoted Dr. Lionel Feuillet of Hôpital de la Timone in [[Marseille]] as saying: "The images were most unusual... the brain was virtually absent."<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,290610,00.html "Man with Almost No Brain Has Led Normal Life"], ''Fox News'' (2007-07-25).  Also see  [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12301-man-with-tiny-brain-shocks-doctors.html "Man with tiny brain shocks doctors"], ''NewScientist.com'' (2007-07-20);  [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070722203858.htm "Tiny Brain, Normal Life"], ''ScienceDaily'' (2007-07-24).</ref>  When doctors learned of the man's medical history, they performed a [[computed tomography]] (CT) scan and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scan, and were astonished to see "massive enlargement" of the [[lateral ventricles]] in the skull. Intelligence tests showed the man had an IQ of 75, below the average score of 100. This would be considered "borderline intellectual functioning"- which is just next to the level of being officially considered mentally challenged.

Remarkably, the man was a married father of two children, and worked as a civil servant, leading an at least superficially normal life, despite having enlarged ventricles with a decreased volume of brain tissue. "What I find amazing to this day is how the brain can deal with something which you think should not be compatible with life," commented Dr. Max Muenke, a pediatric brain defect specialist at the National Human Genome Research Institute. "If something happens very slowly over quite some time, maybe over decades, the different parts of the brain take up functions that would normally be done by the part that is pushed to the side."<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Lives Normal Life Despite Having Abnormal Brain|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=July 19, 2007|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070719.wbrain0719/BNStory/Science/home|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070828013153/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070719.wbrain0719/BNStory/Science/home|archivedate=August 28, 2007|accessdate=July 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12301-man-with-tiny-brain-shocks-doctors.html "Man with tiny brain shocks doctors"], ''[[New Scientist]]'' online, 20 July 2007</ref><ref>Brain of a white-collar worker.

==Famous people with hydrocephalus==

*[[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]], [[Emperor of Austria]] 1835-1848, had mild to moderate hydrocephalus, which contributed to his noted [[epilepsy]] and low intelligence.
*Author [[Sherman Alexie]], born with the condition, wrote about in his semi-autobiographical junior fiction novel ''[[The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian]]''.<ref>http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/11435616.html</ref>
*[[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]] possibly suffered from it, and died at the age of 11.

==Awareness campaign==
September was designated National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month in July, 2009 by the U.S. Congress in HR373. The campaign is sometimes represented by a blue ribbon or a ribbon made of unused shunt tubing (there is some dispute within the hydrocephalus community as to the exact design of awareness ribbons). Many of the hydrocephalus organizations within the United States use various ribbon designs as a part of their awareness and fundraising activities.
