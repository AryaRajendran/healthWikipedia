'''Non islet hypoglycemic cell tumor''' is a rare tumor that secretes the protein [[insulin-like growth factor 2]] into the bloodstream. This [[protein]] causes [[cell (biology)|cells]] to consume excessive amounts of sugar, which can cause the condition [[hypoglycemia]] (low blood sugar).

==Symptoms==
Symptoms include [[night sweats]], [[sleepwalking]], [[memory loss]], and, in very rare cases, abnormal facial [[swelling (medical)|swelling]] and hair [[growth]], as the protein can sometimes act as [[growth hormone]]s. Removal of the [[tumor]] alone will often solve the problems it causes.

==Treatment==
The most common treatment of the tumor is either [[radiotherapy]] or complete removal of the tumor, although there is a high chance of dying during the procedure.

==Diagnosis==
A tumor can be found with the use of an [[x-ray]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]].
