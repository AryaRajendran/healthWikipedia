A '''Pituitary disease''' is a disorder primarily affecting the [[pituitary gland]].<ref name="urlOverview of the Pituitary Gland: Pituitary Gland Disorders: Merck Manual Home Health Handbook">{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/hormonal_and_metabolic_disorders/pituitary_gland_disorders/overview_of_the_pituitary_gland.html |title=Overview of the Pituitary Gland: Pituitary Gland Disorders: Merck Manual Home Health Handbook |work= |accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref>

The main disorders involving the pituitary gland are: 

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Condition''' || '''Direction''' || '''Hormone''' 
 |- 
 | [[Acromegaly]] || overproduction || [[growth hormone]]
 |-
 | [[Cushing's disease]] || overproduction || [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]]
 |- 
 | [[Growth hormone deficiency]] || underproduction || [[growth hormone]]
 |- 
 | [[Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone]] || overproduction || [[vasopressin]]
 |- 
 | [[Diabetes insipidus]] <br>(can also be [[Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus|nephrogenic]]) || underproduction || [[vasopressin]]
 |- 
 | [[Sheehan syndrome]] || underproduction || any [[pituitary]] [[hormone]]
 |- 
 | [[Pickardt-Fahlbusch-Syndrome]] || underproduction || any pituitary [[hormone]], except [[prolactin]], which is increased
 |- 
 | [[Hyperpituitarism]] (most commonly [[pituitary adenoma]]) || overproduction || any pituitary hormone
 |- 
 | [[Hypopituitarism]] || underproduction || any pituitary hormone
|}

Over- or underproduction of a pituitary hormone will effect the respective end-organ. For example insufficient production (hyposecretion) of [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH) in the pituitary gland will cause [[hypothyroidism]], while overproduction (hypersecretion) of TSH will cause [[hyperthyroidism]]. Thyroidisms caused by the pituitary gland are less common though, accounting for less than 10% of all hypothyroidism cases and much less than 1% of hyperthyroidism cases.<ref>[http://books.google.se/books?id=lB6oVJ50oL4C&pg=PA358 Page 358] in: {{cite book |author=Aminoff, Michael J. |title=Neurology and General Medicine: Expert Consult: Online and Print |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-443-06707-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotropin-tsh-secreting-pituitary-adenomas Thyrotropin (TSH)-secreting pituitary adenomas.] By Roy E Weiss and Samuel Refetoff.
