The '''middle cerebellar peduncles''' ('''brachia pontis''') are paired structures (left and right) that connect the cerebellum to the pons and are composed entirely of centripetal fibers, which arise from the cells of the nuclei pontis of the opposite side and end in the cerebellar cortex; the fibers are arranged in three fasciculi, superior, inferior, and deep. 

* The ''superior fasciculus'', the most superficial, is derived from the upper transverse fibers of the pons; it is directed backward and lateralward superficial to the other two fasciculi, and is distributed mainly to the lobules on the inferior surface of the cerebellar hemisphere and to the parts of the superior surface adjoining the posterior and lateral margins. 

* The ''inferior fasciculus'' is formed by the lowest transverse fibers of the [[pons]]; it passes under cover of the superior fasciculus and is continued downward and backward more or less parallel with it, to be distributed to the [[Folium (brain)|folia]] on the under surface close to the [[vermis]].

* The ''deep fasciculus'' comprises most of the deep transverse fibers of the pons. It is at first covered by the superior and inferior fasciculi, but crosses obliquely and appears on the medial side of the superior, from which it receives a bundle; its fibers spread out and pass to the upper anterior cerebellar folia. The fibers of this fasciculus cover those of the [[restiform body]].
