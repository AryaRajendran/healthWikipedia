'''The Perth Group''' is a group of [[AIDS denialism|AIDS denialists]] based in [[Perth, Western Australia]] who claim, in opposition to the scientific consensus, that [[HIV]] infection does not cause [[AIDS]].  The group has affected the epidemic of [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa]] through the impact of their work on South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s AIDS policies.  In 2007 the testimony of several members was thrown out of court during the trial of [[Andre Chad Parenzee|an HIV-positive man]] charged with reckless transmission of HIV.

==Membership==
While overall membership has changed, the core members of the group are [[Biophysics|biophysicist]] technician [[Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos]], [[Emergency medicine|emergency physician]] Valendar F. Turner and [[Pathology|pathologist]] John Papadimitriou.{{sfn|Kalichman|2009|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&pg=PA60#v=onepage&q&f=false 60-61]}}<ref name = Youde/>  The group claims it was founded in 1981.{{sfn|Kalichman|2009|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false 169]}}  Members of the group work at [[Royal Perth Hospital]], though the relationship is disputed.  Papadopulos-Eleopulos has been described as a technician at the hospital, while Turner and Papadimitriou are faculty members.  The hospital has declaimed any relationship to the Group's beliefs, and made a point of stating Papadopulos-Eleopulos does not work with AIDS patients or conduct any research on HIV.<ref name = Youde>{{cite book | last = Youde | first = JR | title = AIDS, South Africa, and the Politics of Knowledge | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=_FHpPXoRulAC&pg=PA106#v=onepage&q&f=false 106â€“107] | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]] | isbn = 978-0-7546-7003-2 }}</ref>

==Claims==
AIDS researcher [[Seth Kalichman]], author of a book on [[AIDS denialism]], described the group's claims as confusing and inconsistent, using complicated explanations and [[rhetoric]]al techniques to "sound scientific" in their incorrect assertions regarding research on [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]].{{sfn|Kalichman|2009|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&pg=PA60#v=onepage&q&f=false 60-61]}}  The group acknowledges that AIDS exists, but denies that it is caused by HIV infection,{{sfn|Kalichman|2009|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false 12]}} producing a list of ten positions that attempts to criticize the established science that [[HIV]] causes AIDS.  Instead, the group attributes AIDS deaths to on [[redox|oxidative damage]] caused by factors unrelated to viral infection, such as drug use, [[Men who have sex with men|homosexual activity between men]] (primarily exposure to [[semen]]), poverty and the medications used to treat AIDS.  Kalichman notes that although oxidation does have an impact on the [[immune system]], none of the processes claimed by the Perth Group cause AIDS, whose cause has been definitively identified as HIV infection.{{sfn|Kalichman|2009|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&pg=PA179#v=onepage&q&f=false 179-180]}}  The group also denies that the causative agent of AIDS is transmitted through heterosexual sexual activity.<ref name="pollard2007">{{cite news | last = Pollard | first = R | date = 2007-05-05 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/shadow-of-doubters/2007/05/04/1177788403414.html | title = Shadow of doubters | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2012-04-19 }}</ref><ref name="Nattrass2007">{{cite journal | last = Nattrass | first = N | year = 2007 | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/aids_denialism_vs._science/ | title = AIDS Denialism vs. Science | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' | volume = 31 | issue = 5}}</ref><ref name="barton2007">{{cite news | last = Barton | first = Chris | date = 2007-10-20 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/new-zealand/news/article.cfm?l_id=71&objectid=10471028 | title = Unzipping an age-old risk | accessdate = 2012-04-19 | work = [[The New Zealand Herald]] }}</ref><ref name="specter1997">{{cite news | last = Specter | first = M | date = 2007-03-12 | url = http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2007-03-12#folio=032 | title = The Denialists | work = [[The New Yorker]] | accessdate = 2012-04-19 | authorlink = Michael Specter }}</ref>

The group has also denied that the human immunodeficiency virus itself exists,<ref name="Nattrass2007"/><ref name="specter1997"/> claiming to offer a $20,000 reward for anybody who can produce evidence for its existence.  [[Peter Duesberg]], an AIDS denialist who claims HIV exists but is harmless, refuted their claims and provided evidence of the existence of HIV, but the group did not provide the money.{{sfn|Kalichman|2009|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&pg=PA60#v=onepage&q&f=false 60-61]}}  Writing in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', professor of economics and the director of the AIDS and Society Research Unit at the [[University of Cape Town]] [[Nicoli Nattrass]] suggested that their beliefs may in part be due to misunderstanding of the science involved.<ref name = "Nattrass2007"/>

==Influence==
===Parenzee trial===
{{main|Andre Chad Parenzee}}
Members of the Perth Group attempted to testify at the trial of Andre Chad Parenzee, an Australian man charged with endangering human life after having unprotected sex with three women despite knowing he was HIV-positive, but the supreme court judge threw out their claims as "implausible."<ref name="barton2007"/>  [[Robert Gallo]], co-discoverer of HIV, testified at the trial and noted that Turner, who had also testified, had incorrectly claimed HIV was identified through the activity of reverse transcription when in fact it was identified through the presence of the [[reverse transcriptase]] [[enzyme]], stating that '"only a fool" would mistake the two'.<ref name="Nattrass2007"/>  Gallo pointed out during the trial that Turner lacked any credibility to testify during the trial regarding HIV infection as he lacked any qualifications as a [[Virology|virologist]] and conducted no research in the field.  Gallo later stated in an e-mail that he was amazed at the Perth Group's "mass ignorance coupled with the grandiosity of selling themselves as experts".<ref name = "Nattrass2007"/>  Australian Research biologist [[Gustav Nossal]], along with several other Australian scientists, gave evidence during the trail and described the group as '"a very considerable embarrassment" to Australian science'.<ref>{{cite news | last = Roberts | first = J | date = 2007-01-30 | accessdate = 2012-04-19 | title = The Nation Nossal attacks HIV sceptics | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/nossal-attacks-hiv-sceptics/story-e6frg6nf-1111112910341 | work = [[The Australian]] }}</ref>
