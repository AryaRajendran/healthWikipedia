The '''stratum granulosum''' (or '''granular layer''') is a thin layer of cells in the [[epidermis_(skin)|epidermis]].<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005) ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology'' (10th ed.). Saunders. Page 2. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref> [[Keratinocytes]] migrating from the underlying [[stratum spinosum]] become known as granular cells in this layer. These cells contain [[keratohyalin]] granules, which are filled with proteins that promote hydration and crosslinking of keratin.<ref name="Lookingbill">Marks, James G; Miller, Jeffery (2006).

At the transition between this layer and the [[stratum corneum]], cells secrete [[lamellar bodies]] (containing [[lipids]] and [[proteins]]) into the extracellular space. This results in the formation of the [[hydrophobic]] lipid envelope responsible for the skin's barrier properties. Concomitantly, cells lose their [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] and [[organelles]] causing the granular cells to become non-viable corneocytes in the stratum corneum.<ref name="ovaere" />
