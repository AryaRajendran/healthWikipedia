'''Helen's Trust''' [http://www.helenstrust.org.uk www.helenstrust.org.uk] is a charity located in [[Derbyshire, England]] which aims to enable people with any terminal illness to have the choice to stay in their own home.<ref>[http://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/news/local/charity_walk_founder_loses_battle_with_cancer_1_475695 Derbyshire Times, May 28, 2008]</ref> Originally established in Baslow, a village in the Peak District, the charity now supports people throughout north Derbyshire and Sheffield, providing a wide variety of help at home. Helen's Trust is not defined by what it provides but more by its creative, sensitive and flexible approach to supporting people at home.

All help offered is tailored to an individual's needs and help includes: sitting services, carers respite, equipment provision and even help with household chores if that is what is needed to help a person with terminal illness stay at home. 

==History==
 
The charity was established in memory of Helen Louise Lyon (nee Astley) who was born in 1956 and died in October 2001, aged 44, from breast cancer.<ref name = "expansion">[http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/Terminally-ill-home-care-scheme.3676263.jp The Star, January 16, 2008]</ref> Throughout her illness, Helen was determined to lead as normal a life as possible and due to the help of family and friends, Helen was able to stay in her own home. On 6th October 2001, she died peacefully at home in the presence of those she loved best. 

It was decided to launch a charity to enable others suffering with terminal illness to have the choice to remain in the comfort and security of their own home. The charity was named after Helen and launched at her funeral a week later in 2001.
