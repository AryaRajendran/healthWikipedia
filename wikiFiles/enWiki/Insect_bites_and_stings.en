'''Insect bites and stings''' occur when an [[insect]] is agitated and seeks to [[Defense in insects | defend]] itself through its natural defense mechanisms, or when an insect seeks to feed off the bitten person. Some insects inject [[formic acid]], which can cause an immediate skin reaction often resulting in redness and swelling in the injured area. Stings from [[fire ant]]s, [[bee]]s, [[wasp]]s and [[hornet]]s are usually [[pain]]ful, and may stimulate a dangerous [[allergy|allergic reaction]] called [[anaphylaxis]] for at-risk patients, and some wasps can also have a powerful bite along with a sting. Bites from [[mosquito]]es and [[flea]]s are more likely to cause [[itch]]ing than pain.

The skin reaction to insect bites and stings usually lasts for up to a few days. However, in some cases the local reaction can last for up to two years. These bites are sometimes misdiagnosed as other types of benign or cancerous lesions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Arthur C.|date=March 1948|title=Persistent "Insect Bites" (Dermal Eosinophilic Granulomas) Simulating Lymphoblastomas, Histiocytoses, and Squamous Cell Carcinomas|journal= Am J Pathol.|volume=24|issue=2|pages=367–387|pmid=18904647|pmc=1942711}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms of insect stings==

The reaction to a sting is of three types. The normal reaction involves the area around the bite with redness, itchiness, and pain. A large local reaction occurs when the area of swelling is greater than 5&nbsp;cm. Systemic reactions are when symptoms occur in areas besides that of the bites.<ref>{{cite book |author=Goddard, Jerome |title=Physician's guide to arthropods of medical importance |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=2002 |pages=14 |isbn=0-8493-1387-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Characteristics of feeding bites of insects and other arthropods===
Feeding bites have characteristic patterns and symptoms, a function of the feeding habits of the offending pest and the chemistry of its saliva.

===Microscopic appearance===
The [[histomorphology|histomorphologic]] appearance of insect bites is usually characterized by a [[Wedge (geometry)|wedge]]-shaped superficial [[dermis|dermal]] peri[[blood vessels|vascular]] infiltrate consisting of abundant [[lymphocyte]]s and scattered [[eosinophil]]s. This appearance is non-specific, i.e. it may be seen in a number of conditions including:<ref name=pmid16311340>{{Cite journal | last1 = Alsaad | first1 = KO. | last2 = Ghazarian | first2 = D. | title = My approach to superficial inflammatory dermatoses. | journal = J Clin Pathol | volume = 58 | issue = 12 | pages = 1233–41 | month = Dec | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.2005.027151  | pmc = 1770784 | pmid = 16311340 }}</ref>
