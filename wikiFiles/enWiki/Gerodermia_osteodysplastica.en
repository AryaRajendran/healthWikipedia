Usage of the name "Walt Disney dwarfism" is attributed to the first known case of the disorder, documented in a 1950 journal report, in which the authors described five affected members from a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] family as having the physical appearance of dwarves from a [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney]] film.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bamatter F, Franceschetti A, Klein D, Sierro A |title=Gerodermie osteodysplastique hereditaire |journal=Ann Pediat. |volume=174 |issue= 4|pages=126–127 |year=1950 |doi=10.1177/0011128707308160 }}</ref><ref name=wd78>{{cite journal |author=Hunter AG, Martsolf JT, Baker CG, Reed MH |title=Geroderma osteodysplastica.

== Characteristics ==

Gerodermia osteodysplastica is characterized by symptoms and features which affect the [[connective tissue]]s, [[skin]] and [[skeletal system]]. 

These are: wrinkly, loose skin over the [[face]], [[abdomen]], and extremites ([[hand]]s, feet) on the [[dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] sides usually worsened by chronic [[joint]] laxity and [[Extension (kinesiology)#Hyperextension|hyperextensibility]];<ref name=gomain>{{cite journal |pmid=11424136 |year=2001 |month=Jul |author=Al-Gazali LI, Sztriha L, Skaff F, Haas D |title=Gerodermia osteodysplastica and wrinkly skin syndrome: are they the same? |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=213–220 |issn=0148-7299 |journal=Am J Med Genet. |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1352}}</ref><ref name=gotwo>{{cite journal |pmid=18304158 |year=2008 |month=Jan |author=Nanda A, Alsaleh QA, Al-Sabah H, Marzouk EE, Salam AM, Nanda M, Anim JT |title=Gerodermia osteodysplastica/wrinkly skin syndrome: report of three patients and brief review of the literature |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=66–71 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1470.2007.00586.x |journal=Pediatr Dermatol.}}</ref> fragmented [[elastic fiber]]s of the skin that are reduced in number, with disorientation of [[collagen|collagen fibers]];<ref name=go06>{{cite journal |pmid=17014644 |year=2006 |month=Sep-Oct |author=Boente Mdel C, Asial RA, Winik BC |title=Geroderma osteodysplastica.

[[delayed milestone|developmental delay]],<ref name=gotwo/>
[[failure to thrive]]<ref name=gomain/> and abnormal [[electroencephalography|electroencephalograph]] (EEG) readings.<ref name=gobed/>

Dental and [[Orthodontics|orthodontal]] abnormalities in addition to maxillary hypoplasia and mandibular prognathism have also been observed in gerodermia osteodysplastica. Including [[malocclusion]] of the [[dental arches]] (the maxilla and mandible),<ref name=go79/> [[radiology|radiological]] findings in some cases have indicated significant overgrowth of the mandibular [[premolar]] and [[molar (tooth)|molar]] roots;<ref name=gosp/>
[[hypercementosis]] (overproduction of [[cementum]]) of the molars and maxillary [[incisor]]s;<ref name=gosp/> enlarged, funnel-shaped [[lingula of mandible|mandibular lingula]] (spiny structures on the [[ramus of the mandible]]);<ref name=gosp/> and a [[radiodensity|radiolucent]] effect on portions of many [[tooth|teeth]], increasing their [[transparency (optics)|transparency]] to [[x-ray]]s.<ref name=gosp/>

== Differential diagnosis ==
Many features of gerodermia osteodysplastica (GO) and another autosomal recessive form of cutis laxa, [[wrinkly skin syndrome]] (WSS, ''{{OMIM|278250}}''), are similar to such an extent that both disorders were believed to be variable [[phenotype]]s of a single disorder.<ref name=gomain/><ref name=gotwo/> 

Several delineating factors, however, suggest that gerodermia osteodysplastica and wrinkly skin syndrome are distinct entities, but share the same clinic spectrum.<ref name=difd/><ref name=gotwo/>

While the prevailing feature of wrinkly, loose skin is more localized with GO, it is usually systemic, yet eases in severity with age during the course of WSS.<ref name=difd/> Also, as the [[fontanelle]]s ("soft spots") are usually normal on the heads of [[infant]]s with GO, they are often enlarged in WSS infants.<ref name=difd/>

Although WSS is associated with [[mutation]]s of [[gene]]s on [[chromosome]]s [[chromosome 2|2]], [[chromosome 5|5]], [[chromosome 7|7]], [[chromosome 11|11]] and [[chromosome 14|14]]; no genetic mutation has been established for GO.<ref name=omim/><ref name=difd/> A [[blood plasma|serum]] [[sialotransferrin]] type 2 pattern, also observed with WSS, is not present in GO patients.<ref name=difd/>

But perhaps the most notable feature, differentiating GO from WSS and similar cutis laxa disorders, is the age-specific metaphyseal peg sometimes found in GO-affected long bone, near the knee.<ref name=gopeg/> Not appearing until around age 4&ndash;5, then disappearing by physeal closure, this oddity of bone is thought to represent a specific genetic marker unique to GO and its effects on bone development.<ref name=gopeg/>

== Inheritance ==

[[Image:Autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Gerodermia osteodysplastica has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]         

Originally believed to be inherited in an [[X-linked recessive]] fashion,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=4980119 |year=1969 |month=May |author=Boreux, G |title=Osteodysplasic geroderma of sex-linked heredity, a new clinical and genetic entity |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=137–78 |issn=0021-7743 |journal=Journal de génétique humaine |language=French |trans_title=Osteodysplasic geroderma of sex-linked heredity, a new clinical and genetic entity}}</ref> gerodermia osteodysplastica is now known to display strictly autosomal recessive inheritance.<ref name=prego/> This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both [[genetic carrier|carry]] one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.

It has been associated with ''[[SCYL1BP1]]''.<ref name="pmid18997784">{{cite journal |author=Hennies HC, Kornak U, Zhang H, ''et al.'' |title=Gerodermia osteodysplastica is caused by mutations in SCL1BP1, a Rab-6 interacting golgin |journal=Nat.
