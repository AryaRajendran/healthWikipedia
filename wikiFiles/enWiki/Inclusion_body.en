'''Inclusion bodies''' are [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] or [[cytoplasmic]] aggregates of stainable substances, usually proteins. They typically represent sites of viral multiplication in a [[bacterium]] or a [[eukaryotic]] cell and usually consist of viral [[capsid]] proteins. Inclusion bodies can also be hallmarks of genetic diseases, as in the case of Neuronal Inclusion bodies in disorders like [[Frontotemporal dementia]] and [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cruts|first=M|coauthors=Gijselinck, I, van der Zee, J, Engelborghs, S, Wils, H, Pirici, D, Rademakers, R, Vandenberghe, R, Dermaut, B, Martin, JJ, van Duijn, C, Peeters, K, Sciot, R, Santens, P, De Pooter, T, Mattheijssens, M, Van den Broeck, M, Cuijt, I, Vennekens, K, De Deyn, PP, Kumar-Singh, S, Van Broeckhoven, C|title=Null mutations in progranulin cause ubiquitin-positive frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 17q21.|journal=Nature|date=2006-08-24|volume=442|issue=7105|pages=920–4|pmid=16862115|accessdate=18 August 2011|doi=10.1038/nature05017}}</ref>

==Composition==
Inclusion bodies have a non-unit lipid membrane. Protein inclusion bodies are classically thought to contain [[misfolded protein]].  However, this has recently been contested, as green fluorescent protein will sometimes fluoresce in inclusion bodies, which indicates some resemblance of the native structure and researchers have recovered folded protein from inclusion bodies.<ref>Biochem Biophys Res Com 328(2005) 189-197</ref><ref>Protein Eng 7(1994) 131-136</ref><ref>Biochem Biophys Res Comm 312 (2003) 1383-1386</ref>

==Mechanism of formation==
When [[genes]] from one organism are expressed in another the resulting protein sometimes forms inclusion bodies. This is often true when large evolutionary distances are crossed:  a [[cDNA]] isolated from [[Eukarya]] for example, and expressed as a [[recombinant gene]] in a [[prokaryote]] risks the formation of the inactive aggregates of protein known as inclusion bodies. While the [[cDNA]] may properly code for a translatable [[mRNA]], the [[protein]] that results will emerge in a foreign microenvironment. This often has fatal effects, especially if the intent of [[cloning]] is to produce a biologically active [[protein]]. For example, [[eukaryotic]] systems for [[carbohydrate]] modification and [[membrane transport]] are not found in [[prokaryotes]].  The internal microenvironment of a [[prokaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] ([[pH]], [[osmolarity]]) may differ from that of the original source of the [[gene]]. Mechanisms for folding a [[protein]] may also be absent, and [[hydrophobic residues]] that normally would remain buried may be exposed and available for interaction with similar exposed sites on other [[ectopic expression|ectopic]] proteins. Processing systems for the cleavage and removal of internal [[peptides]] would also be absent in [[bacteria]].  The initial attempts to clone [[insulin]] in a [[bacterium]] suffered all of these deficits. In addition, the fine controls that may keep the concentration of a [[protein]] low will also be missing in a [[prokaryotic cell]], and [[overexpression]] can result in filling a cell with [[ectopic expression|ectopic]] protein that, even if it were properly folded, would [[precipitate]] by saturating its environment.

==Viral inclusion bodies==
Examples of viral inclusion bodies in animals are
Intracytoplasmic eosinophilic-
* [[Negri bodies]] in [[Rabies]]
* Guarnieri bodies in [[Small pox]]
* Henderson-Peterson bodies in [[Molluscum contagiosum]]
Intranuclear acidophilic-
* [[Cowdry]] type A in [[Herpes simplex virus]] and [[Varicella zoster virus]] and Torres bodies in [[Yellow fever]]
* [[Cowdry]] type B in [[Polio]]

Intranuclear basophilic-
* Cowdry type B in [[Adenovirus]]
* "owl eyes" in [[cytomegalovirus]]
Both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic-
* Warthin finkeldey bodies in [[Measles]]

Examples of viral inclusion bodies in plants [http://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/pdc/Inclusionpage/Florvirus.html] include aggregations of virus particles (like those for ''Cucumber mosaic virus'' [http://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/pdc/Inclusionpage/CMV/CucMoInc.html]) and aggregations of viral proteins (like the cylindrical inclusions of potyviruses [http://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/pdc/Inclusionpage/Poty/poty.html]).  Depending on the plant and the plant virus family these inclusions can be found in epidermal cells, mesophyll cells, and stomatal cells when plant tissue when properly stained [http://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/pdc/Inclusionpage/Howto.html].

==Inclusion bodies in Erythrocytes==
Normally a [[red blood cell]] does not contain inclusions in the cytoplasm. However, it may be seen because of certain hematologic disorders. 

There are three kinds of erythrocyte inclusions:
#'''Developmental Organelles'''
##[[Howell-Jolly bodies]]: small, round fragments of the nucleus resulting from [[karyorrhexis]] or nuclear disintegration of the late [[reticulocyte]] and stain reddish-blue with [[Wright stain]].
##[[Basophilic stipplings]] - this stipplings is either fine or coarse, deep blue to purple staining inclusion that appears in [[erythrocytes]] on a dried [[Wright stain]].
##[[Pappenheimer bodies]] - are [[siderosis|siderotic]] granules which are small, irregular, dark-staining granules that appear near the periphery of a young [[erythrocyte]] in a [[Wright stain]].
##Polychromatophilic red cells - young red cells that no longer have nucleus but still contain some RNA.
##[[Cabot rings|Cabot Rings]] - ring-like structure and may appear in erythrocytes in [[megaloblastic anemia]] or in severe [[anemias]], [[lead poisoning]], and in dyserythropoiesis, in which [[erythrocytes]] are destroyed before being released from the [[bone marrow]].
#'''Abnormal Hemoglobin Precipitation'''
##[[Heinz bodies]] - round bodies, refractile inclusions not visible on a [[Wright stain]] film. It is best identified by supravital staining with basic dyes.
##[[Hemoglobin]] H Inclusions - [[thalassemia|alpha thalassemia]], greenish-blue inclusion bodies appear in many [[erythrocytes]] after four drops of blood is incubated with 0.5mL of Brilliant cresyl blue for 20 minutes at 37°C.
#'''Protozoan Inclusion'''
##[[Malaria]]
##[[Babesia]]

== Current problems with the isolation of proteins from bacterial inclusion bodies ==

70-80% of recombinant proteins expressed ''E. coli'' are contained in inclusion bodies (i.e., protein aggregates).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010|reason=This is a rather specific assertion, which shouldn't be made without evidence.}} The purification of the expressed proteins from inclusion bodies usually require two main steps: extraction of inclusion bodies from the bacteria followed by the solubilisation of the purified inclusion bodies. This is considered labour-intensive, time consuming and not cost effective.

==Pseudo-inclusions==
''Pseudo-inclusions'' are invaginations of the cytoplasm into the [[cell nuclei]], which may give the appearance of intranuclear inclusions. They may appear in [[papillary thyroid carcinoma]].<ref name=Kumar20>Chapter 20 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref>
