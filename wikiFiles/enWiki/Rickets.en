'''Rickets''' is a softening of bones in children due to deficiency or impaired metabolism of [[vitamin D]],<ref>[http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/news-archive/2009/magnesium-and-vitamin-ds-co-factors Magnesium and vitamin D's co-factors, by John Jacob Cannell, M.D. citing The Lancet; The Vitamin D Council] "''Two interesting cases of Mg dependent Vitamin D-resistant rickets appeared in the Lancet in 1974. Two children, one age two and the other age five, presented with classic rickets. 600,000 IU of Vitamin D daily for ten days did not result in any improvement in six weeks—in either x-rays or alkaline phosphatase—and the doctors diagnosed Vitamin D-resistant rickets. Almost by accident, serum Mg levels were then obtained, which were low in both children. After the treatment with Mg, the rickets rapidly resolved.''"</ref> [[phosphorus]] or [[calcium]],<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/rickets TheFreeDictionary > rickets] In turn citing:

Rickets is among the most frequent [[childhood disease]]s in many developing countries. The predominant cause is a [[vitamin D]] deficiency, but lack of adequate [[calcium]] in the diet may also lead to rickets (cases of severe diarrhea and vomiting may be the cause of the deficiency). Although it can occur in adults, the majority of cases occur in children suffering from severe [[malnutrition]], usually resulting from [[famine]] or [[starvation]] during the early stages of childhood.

[[Osteomalacia]] is a similar condition occurring in adults, generally due to a deficiency of [[vitamin D]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000376.htm MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Osteomalacia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The origin of the word ''rickets'' is probably from the Old English word ''wrickken'' ('to twist').  The Greek word "rachitis" (ῥαχίτης,<ref>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=raxiths&la=greek#lexicon</ref> meaning "in or of the spine") was later adopted as the scientific term for rickets, due chiefly to the words' similarity in sound.

An [[X-ray]] or [[radiography|radiograph]] of an advanced sufferer from rickets tends to present in a classic way: bow legs 
(outward curve of long bone of the legs) and a deformed chest. Changes in the skull also occur causing a distinctive "square headed" appearance (Caput Quadratum). These deformities persist into adult life if not treated.                                                 Long-term consequences include permanent bends or disfiguration of the long bones, and a [[Scoliosis|curved back]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Pharmacologyonline | title=Rickets and its Management: A Review | url=http://pharmacologyonline.silae.it/files/newsletter/2011/vol1/081.pattan.pdf| accessdate = 2 June 2012}}</ref>

==Types==
* Nutritional Rickets<ref name="AAFP">[http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0815/p619.html Rickets: Not a Disease of the Past]</ref>
* Vitamin D Resistant Rickets<ref name="AAFP"/>

**Type I
**Type II
* Congenital Rickets
* Newborn Rickets

==Cause==
The primary cause of rickets is a vitamin D deficiency.<ref>http://bone-muscle.health-cares.net/rickets-causes.php</ref> Vitamin D is required for proper calcium absorption from the gut. Sunlight, especially ultraviolet light, lets human skin cells convert Vitamin D from an inactive to active state.  In the absence of vitamin D, dietary calcium is not properly absorbed, resulting in [[hypocalcaemia]], leading to skeletal and dental deformities and [[neuromuscular]] symptoms, e.g. hyperexcitability. Foods that contain vitamin D include butter, eggs, fish liver oils, margarine, fortified milk and juice, portabella & shiitake mushrooms, and [[oily fish]]es such as tuna, herring, and salmon. A rare [[X-linked dominant]] form exists called [[X-linked hypophosphatemia|Vitamin D resistant rickets]].

Cases have been reported in Britain in recent years<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', page 4, Wednesday 19 January 2011</ref> of rickets in children of many social backgrounds caused by insufficient production in the body of vitamin D because the sun's ultraviolet light was not reaching the skin due to use of strong [[sunblock]], too much "covering up" in sunlight, or not getting out into the sun. Other cases have been reported among the children of some ethnic groups in which mothers avoid exposure to the sun for religious or cultural reasons, leading to a maternal shortage of vitamin D;<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/rise-in-rickets-linked-to-ethnic-groups-that-shun-the-sun-2319920.html Rise in rickets linked to ethnic groups that shun the sun] [[The Independent]], published 2011-07-25, accessed 2011-07-251</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7161458.stm Doctors fear rickets resurgence] [[BBC]], published 2007-12-28, accessed 2011-07-25</ref> and people with darker skins need more sunlight to maintain vitamin D levels. The ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' reported in 2010 that doctors in [[Newcastle on Tyne]] saw 20 cases of rickets per year. Rickets had been a significant malaise in London, especially during the Industrial Revolution. Persistent thick fog and heavy industrial smog permeating the city blocked out significant amounts of sunlight so much so that up to 80 percent of children at one time had varying degrees of rickets in one form or the other.

==Diagnosis==
Rickets may be diagnosed with the help of:

*Blood tests:<ref name="NHSChoice">[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Rickets/Pages/Diagnosis.aspx NHS Choice - Rickets Diagnoses]</ref>
**Serum [[calcium]] may show low levels of calcium, serum [[phosphorus]] may be low, and serum [[alkaline phosphatase]] may be high.
*[[Arterial blood gas]]es may reveal [[metabolic acidosis]]
*[[X-ray]]s of affected bones may show loss of calcium from bones or changes in the shape or structure of the bones.
*Bone biopsy is rarely performed but will confirm rickets.<ref name="NHSChoice"/>

==Treatment and prevention==
The treatment and prevention of rickets is known as antirachitic. The most common treatment of rickets is the use of Vitamin D.<ref>{{cite web | last=Meschino Health | title=Complete Guide to Vitamin D | url=http://www.meschinohealth.com/books/vitamin_d| accessdate = 2 June 2012}}</ref> However, surgery may be required to remove severe bone abnormalities.<ref name="AAFP"/>

===Diet and sunlight===
[[Image:Cholecalciferol.svg|thumb|100px|[[Cholecalciferol]] (D<sub>3</sub>)]]
[[Image:Ergocalciferol.svg|thumb|100px|[[Ergocalciferol]] (D<sub>2</sub>)]]
Treatment involves increasing dietary intake of calcium, phosphates and vitamin D. Exposure to ultraviolet B light (sunshine when the sun is highest in the sky), [[cod liver oil]], halibut-liver oil, and [[Ergosterol|viosterol]] are all sources of vitamin D.

A sufficient amount of ultraviolet B light in sunlight each day and adequate supplies of calcium and phosphorus in the diet can prevent rickets. Darker-skinned people need to be exposed longer to the [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet rays]].  The replacement of vitamin D has been proven to correct rickets using these methods of ultraviolet light therapy and medicine.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rajakumar|first=Kumaravel|title=Vitamin D, Cod-Liver Oil, Sunlight, and Rickets: A Historical Perspective|journal=Pediatrics|date=1|year=2003|month=August|volume=112|issue=2|pages=e132–e135|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/2/e132.full|accessdate=14 July 2011|doi=10.1542/peds.112.2.e132|pmid=12897318}}</ref> 

Recommendations are for 400 [[international unit]]s (IU) of vitamin D a day for infants and children. Children who do not get adequate amounts of vitamin D are at increased risk of rickets.  Vitamin D is essential for allowing the body to uptake calcium for use in proper bone calcification and maintenance.

===Supplementation===
Sufficient vitamin D levels can also be achieved through dietary supplementation and/or exposure to sunlight.  Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> ([[cholecalciferol]]) is the preferred form since it is more readily absorbed than vitamin D<sub>2</sub>.  Most [[dermatology|dermatologists]] recommend vitamin D supplementation as an alternative to unprotected ultraviolet exposure due to the increased risk of skin cancer associated with sun exposure. Endogenous production with full body exposure to sunlight is approximately 250&nbsp;µg (10,000 IU) per day.<ref name="Vieth">{{cite journal |author=Vieth R |title=Vitamin D supplementation, 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, and safety |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=842–56 |year=1999 |month=May |pmid=10232622 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/69/5/842}}</ref>

According to the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP), all infants, including those who are exclusively breast-fed, may need Vitamin D supplementation until they start drinking at least {{convert|17|USfloz|ml}} of vitamin D-fortified milk or formula a day.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gartner LM, Greer FR |title=Prevention of rickets and vitamin D deficiency: new guidelines for vitamin D intake |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=908–10 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12671133 |doi= 10.1542/peds.111.4.908|url=http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;111/4/908}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
In developed countries, rickets is a [[rare disease]]<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Rickets/Pages/Introduction.aspx National Health Service of England > Rickets] Last reviewed: 28 January 2010</ref> (incidence of less than 1 in 200,000).

Those at higher risk for developing rickets include:
*[[Breastfeeding|Breast-fed]] infants whose mothers are not exposed to sunlight
*Breast-fed infants who are not exposed to sunlight
*Breast-fed babies who are exposed to little sunlight
*Any child whose diet does not contain enough vitamin D or calcium

==Mistaken for child abuse==
Infants with rickets often suffer bone fractures.  This sometimes leads to child abuse allegations.  This issue appears to be more common for solely nursing infants of black mothers, in winter in temperate climates, suffering poor nutrition and no vitamin D supplementation.<ref>[http://www.pdrads.com/media/RicketsAbuse_KathyKeller.pdf Rickets vs. abuse: a national and international epidemic]</ref><ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7334122 Vitamin D deficiency rickets simulating child abuse.]</ref>  People with darker skin produce less vitamin D than those with lighter skin, for the same amount of sunlight.<ref>{{cite web | last=Live Strong | title=CDark Skin Color & Vitamin D | url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/311881-dark-skin-color-vitamin-d/| accessdate = 2 June 2012}}</ref>

== History ==

Greek physician [[Soranus of Ephesus]], one of the chief representatives of the [[Methodic school]] of medicine who  practiced in [[Alexandria]] and subsequently in [[Rome]], reported deformation of the bones in infants as early as the first and second centuries AD. Rickets was not defined as a specific medical condition until 1645, when an English physician [[Daniel Whistler]] gave the earliest known description of the disease. In 1650 a treatise on rickets was published by [[Francis Glisson]], a physician at [[Caius College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite web
