An '''anatomical theatre''' was an institution used in teaching [[anatomy]] at [[early modern]] universities.

The theatre was usually a room of roughly [[amphitheatre|amphitheatrical]] shape, in the centre of which would stand the table on which the [[dissection]]s of human or animal bodies took place. Around this table were several circular, elliptic or octagonal tiers with railings, where students or other observers could stand and get a good view of the dissection almost from above and unencumbered by the spectators in the rows in front. It was common to display skeletons at some place in the theatre; in Leiden, 17th-century depictions show that the living observers were actually accompanied in the rows by a large number of animal and human skeletons, some of which held banners with inscriptions such as ''[[Memento mori]]'', or, freely translated, "Remember, you will die".

The first anatomical theatre was built at the [[University of Padua]] in 1594 and is still preserved. Other early examples include the Theatrum Anatomicum of [[Leiden University]], built in 1596 and reconstructed in 1988, and the [[Anatomical Theatre of the Archiginnasio]] in [[Bologna]] (whose building dates from 1563 and the anatomical theatre from 1637).

The anatomical theatre completed in 1663 by medical professor and amateur architect [[Olaus Rudbeck]] for the [[University of Uppsala]] is located in the idiosyncratic cupola which Rudbeck placed on top of the [[Gustavianum]] building, at the time the main building of the university. Rudbeck had spent time in Leiden, and both the anatomical theatre and the botanical garden he founded in Uppsala in 1655 were influenced by his experiences there.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] built an anatomical theatre for the [[University of Virginia]]. It was completed in 1827 but demolished in 1938 to leave place for a new library building.
