'''Copperiedus''' refers to the consequences of an excess of [[copper]] in the body. Copperiedus can occur from eating acid foods cooked in uncoated copper cookware, or from exposure to excess copper in drinking water or other environmental sources.

==Toxicity==
Copper in the blood exist in two forms: bound to [[ceruloplasmin]] (85â€“95%) and the rest "free" loosely bound to [[albumin]] and small molecules. Free copper causes toxicity, as it generates [[reactive oxygen species]] such as [[superoxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and the [[hydroxyl radical]]. These  damage  [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s and [[DNA]].<ref name="Brewer"/>

==Symptoms and presentation==
Acute symptoms of copper poisoning by ingestion include vomiting, hematemesis (vomiting of blood), hypotension (low blood pressure), melena (black "tarry" feces), coma, jaundice (yellowish pigmentation of the skin), and gastrointestinal distress.<ref name="Casarett">Casarett & Doull's Toxicology, The Basic Science of Poisons, Fifth Edition, Edited by Curtis D. Klassen, Ph.D., McGraw-Hill, New York. pp 715.</ref>  Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate deficiency may be at increased risk of hematologic effects of copper.<ref name="Casarett" />  Hemolytic anemia resulting from the treatment of burns with copper compounds is infrequent.<ref name="Casarett" />  

Chronic (long-term) effects of copper exposure can damage the liver and kidneys.<ref name="CopperHealth">Copper: Health Information Summary, Environmental Fact Sheet. New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services,ARD-EHP-9 2005, Available Online at: http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/pip/factsheets/ard/documents/ard-ehp-9.pdf</ref>  Mammals have efficient mechanisms to regulate copper stores such that they are generally protected from excess dietary copper levels.<ref name="CopperHealth" />

The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Maximum Contaminant Level]] (MCL) in drinking water is 1.3 milligrams per liter.<ref name="Casarett" /><ref>Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 8 / Wednesday, January 12, 2000 / Rules and Regulations. pp. 1976.</ref>  The MCL for copper is based on the expectation that a lifetime of consuming copper in water at this level is without adverse effect (gastrointestinal). The USEPA lists evidence that copper causes testicular cancer as "most adequate" according to the latest research at Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute.<ref>U.S. EPA. Integrated Risk Information System. Available Online at: http://www.epa.gov/ncea/iris/subst/0368.html</ref>  The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set a limit of 0.1&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> for copper fumes (vapor generated from heating copper) and 1&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> for copper dusts (fine metallic copper particles) and mists (aerosol of soluble copper) in workroom air during an eight-hour work shift, 40-hour work week.<ref>Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Copper, Available Online at: http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/metalsheavy/copper.html</ref>

==EPA cancer data==
The EPA lists no evidence for human cancer incidence connected with copper, and lists animal evidence linking copper to cancer as "inadequate". Two studies in mice have shown no increased incidence of cancer. One of these used regular injections of copper compounds, including cupric oxide. One study of two strains of mice fed copper compounds found a varying increased incidence of [[reticulum cell sarcoma]] in males of one strain, but not the other (there was a slightly increased incidence in females of both strains). These results have not been repeated.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0368.htm EPA results for copper and cancer. Accessed March 11, 2011]</ref>

==Treatment==
In cases of suspected copper poisoning, [[penicillamine]] is the drug of choice, and [[dimercaprol]], a heavy metal chelating agent, is often administered. Vinegar is not recommended to be given, as it assists in solubilizing insoluble copper salts. The inflammatory symptoms are to be treated on general principles, as are the nervous ones.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==Cookware==
When acidic foods are cooked in unlined copper cookware, or in lined cookware where the lining has worn through, toxic amounts of copper can leach into the foods being cooked.<ref>{{cite web | title= The Safe Use of Cookware | url= http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/iyh-vsv/prod/cook-cuisinier-eng.php#be | publisher = Health Canada | accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref> This effect is exacerbated if the copper has corroded, creating reactive salts.<ref>{{cite web | title= Cookware retinning and Copper Repair | url= http://www.retinning.com/care.html | accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref> Actual cooking may not be required for copper to leach into acidic liquids if they are stored in copper for a period of time.<ref>http://www.foodscience.csiro.au/fshbull/fshbull20f.htm</ref> Many countries and states prohibit or restrict the sale of unlined copper cookware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Non-sparking tools==
OSHA has set safety standards for grinding and sharpening copper and copper alloy tools, which are often used in nonsparking applications. These standards are recorded in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] 29 CFR 1910.134 and 1910.1000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=12716&p_table=standards |title=Occupational Safety and Health Standards  |date= |accessdate=2012-09-18}}</ref>

Note: The most important nonsparking copper alloy is [[beryllium copper]], and can lead to [[beryllium poisoning]].

==Drinking water==
With an {{LD50}} of 30&nbsp;mg/kg in rats, "gram quantities" of [[copper sulfate]] are potentially [[Lethal dose|lethal]] in humans.<ref>{{cite web | title = Pesticide Information Profile for Copper Sulfate | url = http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/carbaryl-dicrotophos/copper-sulfate-ext.html | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate=2008-07-10}}</ref> The suggested safe level of copper in [[drinking water]] for humans varies depending on the source, but tends to be pegged at 2.0&nbsp;mg/l.<ref>http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2000/20003184.htm#30</ref>

==Water tank connection==
In a false news article, copper poisoning was linked to a plastic tank; the article indicated rainwater was collected and stored in a plastic tank and the tank did nothing to mitigate the low pH. The water was then brought into homes with copper piping, the copper was released by the high acid rainwater and caused poisoning in humans. While the plastic tank is an inert container, it has no effect on the incoming water. Good practice would be to analyze any water source periodically and treat accordingly, in this case the collected acid rain should be analyzed, and pH adjusted, before being brought into a domestic water supply system. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

A case of this nature has been demonstrated, though without the claim of poisoning. Rainwater absorption of atmospheric CO2 sends stored rainwater slightly acidic by formation of carbonic acid (H2CO3). A water supply stored in galvanised tanks and distributed via copper pipes did not cause any characteristic copper staining of baths and sinks over some ten years. On changing to steel-clad plastic bladder tanks, noticeable staining began to occur. The mechanism appears to be one of sacrifice by the galvanised tank inner walls, with rainwater acidity being neutralised as it gradually attacked the galvanising. Delivery water was thus substantially neutral. Without the sacrificial buffering of the galvanising, water pH became acidic and was able to leach sufficient copper from pipe walls to cause noticeable and contunuing staining of a bath. The level of staining was such that actual human toxicity was not suggested.
 
The acidic water may be monitored  with a variety of technologies, beginning with pH strips and more sophisticated pH monitors. There is no "linkage" between the plastic tank and copper poisoning, a solution to the problem is easy: monitor stored rainwater with swimming pool pH strips, which are cheap and available at swimming pool supply outlets. If the water is too acidic, contact state/county/local health officials to obtain advice and precise solutions. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Pathophysiology==
A significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state. This catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions, such as [[hydroxyl radical]] in a manner similar to [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton chemistry]].<ref name=PubMed>{{cite journal | journal = Radiat Res. | author = Held KD ''et al.'' | date = May 1996 | volume = 145 | issue = 5 |pages = 542&ndash;53 | title = Role of Fenton chemistry in thiol-induced toxicity and apoptosis | doi = 10.2307/3579272 | pmid = 8619019 | publisher = Radiation Research Society | jstor = 3579272}}</ref> This catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes with which it is associated, thus is only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. This increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed [[oxidative stress]], and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity.

Some of the effects of aging may be associated with excess copper.<ref name="pmid17259340">{{cite journal |author=Brewer GJ |title=Iron and copper toxicity in diseases of aging, particularly atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease |journal=Exp. Biol. Med.

However, it is unknown at this stage whether the copper contributes to the mental illness, whether the body attempts to store more copper in response to the illness, or whether the high levels of copper are the result of the mental illness.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Indian childhood cirrhosis ===
One manifestation of copper toxicity, [[cirrhosis of the liver]] in children (Indian childhood cirrhosis), has been linked to boiling milk in copper cookware. The [[Merck Manual]] states recent studies suggest that a genetic defect is associated with this particular cirrhosis.<ref>{{cite web  | url = http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec01/ch005/ch005c.html?qt=copper%20and%20milk&alt=sh | title =  Merck Manuals -- Online Medical Library: Copper | publisher = Merck | date =  November 2005 | accessdate = 2008-07-19}}</ref>

===Wilson's disease===
An inherited condition called [[Wilson's disease]] causes the body to retain copper, since it is not excreted by the [[liver]] into the [[bile]]. This disease, if untreated, can lead to [[brain]] and [[liver]] damage. <!--.<ref name=Ala>{{cite journal |author=Ala A, Walker AP, Ashkan K, Dooley JS, Schilsky ML |title=Wilson's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9559 |pages=397â€“408 |year=2007 |pmid=17276780 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60196-2}}</ref> THE REFERENCE IS FROM WIKI:Wilson's disease but it has to be checked if it is in line with what is stated here-->

== Bacteria ==
Copper and [[copper alloys]] such as [[brass]] have been found to be toxic to bacteria via the [[oligodynamic effect]]. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but common to other heavy metals. Viruses are less susceptible to this effect than bacteria. Associated applications include the use of brass doorknobs in hospitals, which have been found to self-disinfect after eight hours, and [[mineral sanitizer]]s, in which copper can act as an algicide. Overuse of copper sulfate as an algicide has been speculated to have caused a copper poisoning epidemic on [[Great Palm Island]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Prociv P |title=Algal toxins or copper poisoning--revisiting the Palm Island "epidemic" |journal=Med.
