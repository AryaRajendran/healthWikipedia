The '''proximal tubule''' is the portion of the [[Duct (anatomy)|duct]] system of the [[nephron]] of the kidney which leads from [[Bowman's capsule]] to the [[loop of Henle]].

==Structure and appearance==
The most distinctive characteristic of the '''proximal tubule''' is its [[brush border]] (or "striated border"). 

===Brush border cell=== <!--Renal proximal tubule brush border cell redirects here-->
The luminal surface of the [[epithelial]] cells of this segment of the nephron is covered with densely packed [[microvilli]] forming a border readily visible under the [[light microscope]] giving the [[Brush border| brush border cell]] its name.  The microvilli greatly increase the [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] surface area of the cells, presumably facilitating their [[resorptive]] function as well as putative flow sensing within the lumen.<ref>{{cite journal   | last=Wang | first=T  | title=Flow-activated transport events along the nephron.  | journal=Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension  | volume=15 | issue=5 | pages=530–6  | date=Sep-2006 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16914967  | pmid=16914967  | doi=10.1097/01.mnh.0000242180.46362.c4  | pmc= }}</ref>

The [[cytoplasm]] of the cells is densely packed with [[mitochondria]], which are largely found in the basal region within the infoldings of the basal plasma membrane.  The high quantity of mitochondria gives the cells an acidophilic appearance.  The mitochondria are needed in order to supply the energy for the active transport of sodium ions out of the proximal tubule.  Water passively follows the sodium out of the cell along its concentration gradient. 

Cuboidal epithelial cells lining the proximal tubule have extensive lateral interdigitations between neighboring cells, which lend an appearance of having no discrete cell margins when viewed with a light microscope. 

[[Agonist|Agonal]] resorption of the proximal tubular contents after interruption of circulation in the [[capillaries]] surrounding the tubule often leads to disturbance of the cellular morphology of the proximal tubule cells, including the ejection of  cell nuclei into the tubule lumen.  

This has led some observers to describe the lumen of proximal tubules as occluded or "dirty-looking," in contrast to the "clean" appearance of [[distal tubules]], which have quite different properties.

==Divisions==
The proximal tubule as a part of the nephron can be divided into two sections, ''pars convoluta'' and ''pars recta''. Differences in cell outlines exist between these segments, and therefore presumably in function too.

Regarding [[ultrastructure]], it can be divided into three segments, ''S1, S2, and S3'':

|}

===Pars convoluta===
The "Pars convoluta" is the initial ''convoluted portion''. 

In relation to the morphology of the kidney as a whole, the convoluted segments of the proximal tubules are confined entirely to the [[renal cortex]].  

Some investigators on the basis of particular functional differences have divided the convoluted part into two segments designated ''S1'' and ''S2''.

===Pars recta=== <!--Proximal straight tubule redirects here-->
The "Pars recta" is the following ''straight (descending) portion. 

Straight segments descend into the outer [[renal medulla|medulla]]. They terminate at a remarkably uniform level and it is their line of termination that establishes the boundary between the inner and outer stripes of the outer zone of the renal medulla.

As a logical extension of the nomenclature described above, this segment is sometimes designated as ''S3''.

==Absorption==
The proximal tubule regulates the pH of the filtrate by exchanging hydrogen ions in the interstitium for bicarbonate ions in the filtrate; it is also responsible for secreting organic acids, such as creatinine and other bases, into the filtrate.

Fluid in the filtrate entering the proximal convoluted tubule is reabsorbed into the [[peritubular capillaries]]. This is driven by sodium transport from the lumen into the blood by the [[NaKATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase]] in the [[basolateral membrane]] of the epithelial cells.  Sodium reabsorption is primarily driven by this [[P-type ATPase]]. This is the most important transport mechanism in the PCT.

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Substance''' || '''% of filtrate reabsorbed''' || '''Comments'''
 |- 
 |  salt and water || approximately two-thirds || Much of the mass movement of water and solutes occurs through the cells, passively across the lumenal membrane via [[transcellular transport]], which is then actively resorbed across the basolateral membrane via the [[Na/K/ATPase]] pump. The solutes are absorbed [[isotonicity|isotonically]], in that the osmotic potential of the fluid leaving the proximal tubule is the same as that of the initial glomerular filtrate. 
 |- 
 |  [[organic compound|organic]] solutes (primarily [[glucose]] and [[amino acid]]s)  || 100% || [[Glucose]], [[amino acids]], inorganic [[phosphate]], and some other solutes are reabsorbed via secondary active transport through [[cotransporter|cotransport channels]] driven by the sodium gradient out of the nephron.
 |- 
 | [[potassium]]  || approximately 65% ||  Most of the filtered potassium is reabsorbed by two [[paracellular transport|paracellular]] mechanisms - [[solvent drag]] and simple diffusion. <ref>Boron & Boulpaep.  Medical Physiology.  Updated Edition.  2005.</ref>
 |- 
 | [[urea]]  || approximately 50% ||  Paracellular fluid reabsorption sweeps some urea with it via solvent drag.  As water leaves the lumen, the concentration of urea increases, which facilitates diffusion in the late proximal tubule.<ref>Boron & Boulpaep. Medical Physiology. Updated Edition. 2005.</ref>
 |- 
 | [[phosphate]] || approximately 80% || [[Parathyroid hormone]] reduces reabsorption of [[phosphate]] in the proximal tubules, but, because it also enhances the uptake of phosphate from the [[intestine]] and [[bone]]s into the blood, the responses to PTH cancel each other out, and the serum concentration of phosphate remains approximately the same.
 |-
 | [[citrate]] || 70%&ndash;90%<ref>{{eMedicine|article|444968|Hypocitraturia|overview#aw2aab6b5}}</ref> || Acidosis increases absorption. Alkalosis decreases absorption.
|}

==Secretion==
Many types of [[medications]] are secreted in the proximal tubule. ''Further reading: [[Table of medication secreted in kidney]]''

Most of the [[ammonium]] that is excreted in the urine is formed in the proximal tubule via the breakdown of [[glutamine]] to [[alpha-ketoglutarate]].<ref name=Rennke132>{{cite book|last=Rennke|first=Burton D. Rose, Helmut G.|title=Renal pathophysiology : the essentials|year=1994|publisher=Williams & Wilkins|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-683-07354-0|pages=132}}</ref> This takes place in two steps, each of which generates an ammonium anion: the conversion of glutamine to [[glutamate]] and the conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate. <ref name=Rennke132 /> The alpha-ketoglutarate generated in this process is then further broken down to form two [[bicarbonate]] anions,<ref name=Rennke132 /> which are  pumped out of the basolateral portion of the tubule cell by cotransport with sodium ions.

==Pathophysiology in kidney disease==
[[File:Kidney cd10 ihc.jpg|thumb|[[Immunohistochemical staining]] of the '''convoluted tubules''' and [[glomeruli]] with [[CD10]].]]
Proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) have a pivotal role in kidney disease.

===Malignant===
Most [[renal cell carcinoma]], the most common form of [[kidney cancer]], arises from the convoluted tubules.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tomita Y |title=Early renal cell cancer |journal=Int. J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=22–7 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16508725 |doi=10.1007/s10147-005-0551-4 |url=}}</ref>

===Non-malignant===
[[Acute tubular necrosis]] occurs when PTECs are directly damaged by toxins such as antibiotics (e.g., [[gentamicin]]), pigments (e.g., [[myoglobin]] and sepsis (e.g., mediated by [[lipopolysaccharide]] from gram-negative bacteria).  [[Renal tubular acidosis]] (proximal type) (Fanconi syndrome) occurs when the PTECs are unable to properly reabsorb glomerular filtrate so that there is increased loss of [[bicarbonate]], [[glucose]], [[amino acids]], and [[phosphate]].  

PTECs also participate in the progression of tubulointerstitial injury due to [[glomerulonephritis]], [[ischemia]], [[interstitial nephritis]], vascular injury, and [[diabetic nephropathy]].  In these situations, PTECs may be directly affected by protein (e.g., proteinuria in [[glomerulonephritis]]), [[glucose]] (in [[diabetes mellitus]]), or cytokines (e.g., [[interferon-γ]] and [[tumor necrosis factors]]).  There are several ways in which PTECs may respond: producing [[cytokines]], [[chemokines]], and [[collagen]]; undergoing epithelial mesenchymal trans-differentiation; necrosis or [[apoptosis]].
