==Risk factors==
[[Epidemiology]] suggests a number of risk factors for heart disease: age, gender, high blood pressure, high [[serum]] [[cholesterol]] levels, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, family history, [[obesity]], lack of physical activity, psychosocial factors, diabetes mellitus, [[air pollution]].<ref name = Fuster/> While the individual contribution of each risk factor varies between different communities or ethnic groups the consistency of the overall contribution of these risk factors to epidemiological studies is remarkably strong.<ref name = interheart>{{cite journal |author=Yusuf S, Hawken S, Ounpuu S, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with myocardial infarction in 52 countries (the INTERHEART study): case-control study |journal=Lancet |volume=364 |issue=9438 |pages=937–52 |year=2004 |pmid=15364185 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17018-9 |url=}}</ref> Some of these risk factors, such as age, gender or family history, are immutable; however, many important cardiovascular risk factors are modifiable by lifestyle change, drug treatment or social change.

===Age===
[[File:Calcified Heart.jpg|thumb|Calcified heart of older woman with Cardiomegaly taken at the [https://www.cardiologia.org.mx/english/ Instituto Nacional de Cardiología], [[Mexico]].]]

Age is an important risk factor in developing cardiovascular diseases. It is estimated that 87 percent of people who die of coronary heart disease are 60 and older.<ref>"Understand Your Risk of Heart Attack". American Heart Association.http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/UnderstandYourRiskofHeartAttack/Understand-Your-Risk-of-Heart-Attack_UCM_002040_Article.jsp#</ref> At the same time, the risk of stroke doubles every decade after age 55.<ref>Mackay, Mensah, Mendis, et al. The Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke. World Health Organization. January 2004.</ref>

Multiple explanations have been proposed to explain why age increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. One of them is related to serum cholesterol level.<ref name=Jou99>{{cite journal | author = Jousilahti Vartiainen, Tuomilehto Puska | year = 1999 | title = Sex, Age,Cardiovascular Risk Factors, and coronary heart disease | url = | journal = Circulation | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 1165–1172 }}</ref> In most populations, the serum total cholesterol level increases as age increases. In men, this increase levels off around age 45 to 50 years. In women, the increase continues sharply until age 60 to 65 years.<ref name=Jou99/> 

Aging is also associated with changes in the mechanical and structural properties of the vascular wall, which leads to the loss of arterial elasticity and reduced arterial compliance and may subsequently lead to coronary artery disease.<ref name="autogenerated357">{{cite journal | author = Jani B, Rajkumar C | year = 2006 | title = Ageing and vascular ageing | url = | journal = Postgrad Med J | volume = 82 | issue = | pages = 357–362 }}</ref>

===Sex===
Men are at greater risk of heart disease than pre-menopausal women.<ref name=WHF>http://www.world-heart-federation.org/cardiovascular-health/cardiovascular-disease-risk-factors</ref> However, once past [[menopause]], a woman's risk is similar to a man's.<ref name=WHF/> 

Among middle-aged people, coronary heart disease is 2 to 5 times more common in men than in women.<ref name=Jou99/>  In a study done by the [[World Health Organization]], sex contributes to approximately 40% of the variation in the sex ratios of coronary heart disease mortality.<ref>Jackson R, Chambles L, Higgins M, Kuulasmaa K, Wijnberg L, Williams D (WHO MONICA Project, and ARIC Study.) Sex difference in ischaemic heart disease mortality and risk factors in 46 communities:  an ecologic analysis. Cardiovasc Risk Factors. 1999; 7:43-54.</ref> Another study reports similar results that gender difference explains nearly half of the risk associated with cardiovascular diseases<ref name=Jou99/> 
One of the proposed explanations for the gender difference in cardiovascular disease is hormonal difference.<ref name=Jou99/>  Among women, estrogen is the predominant sex hormone. [[Estrogen]] may have protective effects through glucose metabolism and hemostatic system, and it may have a direct effect on improving [[endothelial]] cell function.<ref name=Jou99/>  The production of estrogen decreases after menopause, and may change the female lipid metabolism toward a more atherogenic form by decreasing the [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] cholesterol level and by increasing LDL and total cholesterol levels.<ref name=Jou99/>  Women who have experienced early menopause, either naturally or because they have had a hysterectomy, are twice as likely to develop heart disease as women of the same age group who have not yet gone through menopause.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

Among men and women, there are differences in body weight, height, body fat distribution, heart rate, stroke volume, and arterial compliance.<ref name="autogenerated357"/> In the very elderly, age related large artery pulsatility and stiffness is more pronounced in women.<ref name="autogenerated357"/> This may be caused by the smaller body size and arterial dimensions independent of menopause.<ref name="autogenerated357"/>

===Air pollution===
[[Particulate matter]] has been studied for its short- and long-term exposure [[Particulate_matter#Health_effects|effects on cardiovascular disease]]. Currently, PM<sub>2.5</sub> is the major focus, in which gradients are used to determine CVD risk. For every 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> of PM<sub>2.5</sub> long-term exposure, there was an estimated 8-18% CVD mortality risk.<ref name=Kha11>{{cite book|last=Khallaf|first=Mohamed|title=The Impact of Air Pollution on Health, Economy, Environment and Agricultural Sources|year=2011|publisher=InTech|isbn=978-953-307-528-0|pages=69–92|url=http://www.intechweb.org/books/show/title/the-impact-of-air-pollution-on-health-economy-environment-and-agricultural-sources}}</ref> Women had a higher relative risk (RR) (1.42) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> induced coronary artery disease than men (0.90) did.<ref name=Kha11/>  Overall, long-term PM exposure increased rate of atherosclerosis and inflammation. In regards to short-term exposure (2 hours), every 25 μg/m<sup>3</sup> of PM<sub>2.5</sub> resulted in a 48% increase of CVD mortality risk.<ref name="DOIthromres" /> Additionally, after only 5 days of exposure, a rise in systolic (2.8 mmHg) and diastolic (2.7 mmHg) blood pressure occurred for every 10.5 μg/m<sup>3</sup> of PM<sub>2.5</sub>.<ref name="DOIthromres">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.thromres.2011.10.030 |author=Franchini M, Mannucci PM | pmid =22113148 | title = Air pollution and cardiovascular disease | year = 2012 | journal = Thrombosis Research | volume = 129 | issue = 3 | pages = 230–4  }}</ref>  Other research has implicated PM<sub>2.5</sub> in irregular heart rhythm, reduced heart rate variability (decreased vagal tone), and most notably heart failure.<ref name="DOIthromres" /><ref name="Doicirculationaha">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.893461 | pmid =20585020 | title = Cardiovascular Effects of Ambient Particulate Air Pollution Exposure | year = 2010 | journal = Circulation | volume = 121 | issue = 25 | pages = 2755–65 | pmc = 2924678  }}</ref>  PM<sub>2.5</sub> is also linked to [[carotid artery]] thickening and increased risk of acute myocardial infarction.<ref name="DOIthromres" /><ref name="Doicirculationaha" />

==Pathophysiology==
Population based studies show that atherosclerosis the major precursor of cardiovascular disease begins in childhood. The Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth Study demonstrated that intimal lesions appear in all the aortas and more than half of the right coronary arteries of youths aged 7–9 years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vanhecke TE, Miller WM, Franklin BA, Weber JE, McCullough PA |title=Awareness, knowledge, and perception of heart disease among adolescents |journal=Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil. |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=718–23 |year=2006 |month=Oct |pmid=17001210 |doi=10.1097/01.hjr.0000214611.91490.5e |url=}}</ref>

This is extremely important considering that 1 in 3 people will die from complications attributable to atherosclerosis. In order to stem the tide education and awareness that cardiovascular disease poses the greatest threat and measures to prevent or reverse this disease must be taken.

Obesity and [[diabetes mellitus]] are often linked to cardiovascular disease,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Highlander P, Shaw GP | year = 2010 | title = Current pharmacotherapeutic concepts for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in diabetics | url = | journal = Ther Adv Cardiovasc Dis. | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 43–54 }}</ref> as are a history of chronic [[kidney disease]] and [[hypercholesterolaemia]].<ref name="nps01">{{cite web |title=NPS Prescribing Practice Review 53: Managing lipids |url=http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/prescribing_practice_review/current/prescribing_practice_review_53 |author=NPS Medicinewise |accessdate=1 August 2011 |date=1 March 2011}}</ref>  In fact, cardiovascular disease is the most life threatening of the diabetic complications and diabetics are two- to four-fold more likely to die of cardiovascular-related causes than nondiabetics.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kvan E., Pettersen K.I., Sandvik L., Reikvam A. | year = 2007 | title = High mortality in diabetic patient with acute myocardial infarction: cardiovascular co-morbidities contribute most to the high risk | url = | journal = Int J Cardiol | volume = 121 | issue = | pages = 184–188 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Norhammar A., Malmberg K., Diderhol E., Lagerqvist B., Lindahl B., Ryde  ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | title = Diabetes mellitus: the major risk factor in unstable coronary artery disease even after consideration of the extent of coronary artery disease and benefits of revascularization.

==Screening==
Screening [[ECG]]s (either at rest or with exercise) are not recommended in those without symptoms who are at low risk.<ref name=Annals2012>{{cite journal|last=Moyer|first=VA|coauthors=U.S. Preventive Services Task, Force|title=Screening for coronary heart disease with electrocardiography: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement.|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=2012 Oct 2|volume=157|issue=7|pages=512–8|pmid=22847227|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-157-7-201210020-00514}}</ref> In those at higher risk the evidence for screening with ECGs is inconclusive.<ref name=Annals2012/>

Some [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]] may add to conventional cardiovascular risk factors in predicting the risk of future cardiovascular disease; however, the clinical value of some biomarkers is still questionable.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wang TJ, Gona P, Larson MG, Tofler GH, Levy D, Newton-Cheh C, Jacques PF, Rifai N, Selhub J, Robins SJ, Benjamin EJ, D'Agostino RB, Vasan RS |title=Multiple biomarkers for the prediction of first major cardiovascular events and death |journal=N.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death. In 2008, 30% of all global death is attributed to cardiovascular diseases. Death caused by cardiovascular diseases are also higher in low and middle-income countries as over 80% of all global death caused by cardiovascular diseases occurred in those countries. It is also estimated that by 2030, over 23 million people will die from cardiovascular diseases annually.

==Research==
The first studies on cardiovascular health were performed in 1949 by [[Jerry Morris]] using occupational health data and were published in 1958.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Morris J. N., Crawford Margaret D. | year = 1958 | title = Coronary Heart Disease and Physical Activity of Work | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 5111| pages = 1485–1496 | pmc=2027542 | pmid=13608027}}</ref> The causes, prevention, and/or treatment of all forms of cardiovascular disease remain active fields of [[biomedical research]], with hundreds of scientific studies being published on a weekly basis. A trend has emerged, particularly in the early 2000s, in which numerous studies have revealed a link between fast food and an increase in heart disease. These studies include those conducted by the Ryan Mackey Memorial Research Institute, [[Harvard University]] and the Sydney Center for Cardiovascular Health. Many major [[fast food]] chains, particularly [[McDonald's]], have protested the methods used in these studies and have responded with healthier menu options.

A fairly recent emphasis is on the link between low-grade inflammation that hallmarks atherosclerosis and its possible interventions. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a common inflammatory marker that has been found to be present in increased levels in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 20024640 | doi=10.1007/s00059-009-3305-7 | volume=34 | issue=8 | title=CRP in cardiovascular disease | year=2009 | month=December | author=Karakas M, Koenig W | journal=Herz | pages=607–13}}</ref>  Also [[osteoprotegerin]] which involved with regulation of a key inflammatory transcription factor called [[NF-κB]] has been found to be a risk factor of cardiovascular disease and mortality.<ref>20448212</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 20447527 | doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2010.03.013 | volume=55 | issue=19 | title=Osteoprotegerin as a predictor of coronary artery disease and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity | year=2010 | month=May | author=Venuraju SM, Yerramasu A, Corder R, Lahiri A | journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. | pages=2049–61}}</ref>

Some areas currently being researched include possible links between [[infection]] with ''[[Chlamydophila pneumoniae]]'' (a major cause of [[pneumonia]]) and coronary artery disease. The ''Chlamydia'' link has become less plausible with the absence of improvement after [[antibiotic]] use.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Andraws R, Berger JS, Brown DL |title=Effects of antibiotic therapy on outcomes of patients with coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] |volume=293 |issue=21 |pages=2641–7 |year=2005 |month=Jun |pmid=15928286 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.21.2641 |url=}}</ref>

Several research also investigated the benefits of melatonin on cardiovascular diseases prevention and cure. Melatonin is a pineal gland secretion and it is shown to be able to lower total cholesterol, very low density and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the blood plasma of rats. Reduction of blood pressure is also observed when pharmacological doses are applied. Thus, it is deemed to be a plausible treatment for hypertension. However, further research needs to be conducted to investigate the side effects, optimal dosage and etc. before it can be licensed for use.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dominguez-Rodriguez |first=Alberto |title=Melatonin and Cardiovascular Disease: Myth or Reality? |journal=Rev Esp Cardiol |volume=65 |year=2012 |month=January |pages=215–218}}</ref>
