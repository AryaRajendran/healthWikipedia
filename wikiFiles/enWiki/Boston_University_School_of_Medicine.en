'''Boston University School of Medicine''' ('''BUSM''') is one of the graduate schools of [[Boston University]]. Founded in 1848, the [[medical school]] holds the unique distinction as the first institution in the world to formally educate female physicians. Originally known as the New England Female Medical College, it was subsequently renamed BUSM in 1873. It is notably also the first medical school in the United States to award an M.D. degree to an African-American woman in 1864. 

As the only medical school located in the [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|South End]] neighborhood of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], BUSM and [[Boston Medical Center]], its primary teaching hospital, operates the largest 24-hour Level I trauma center in New England, the largest network of regional community health centers, and possesses the most diverse patient base in New England. BUSM is also the home of the world-renowned [[Framingham Heart Study]] - from which all knowledge of cardiovascular disease risk factors were originally discovered. Notable alumni of the medical school include [[Marcia Angell]], former editor-in-chief of the prestigious [[New England Journal of Medicine]] and the only woman to hold the position in the journal's almost 200 year history, as well as [[Louis Wade Sullivan]], former Secretary of the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] and founder of [[Morehouse School of Medicine]]. Boston University School of Medicine is ranked 30th on the 2014 list of Best Medical Schools by the [[US News and World Report]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/research-rankings/page+2 |title=Best Medical Schools &#124; Research Rankings &#124; Top Medical Schools for Research &#124; US News Best Graduate Schools |work=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date=2013-03-24 |accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref>

==History==
The '''[[New England Female Medical College]]''' was the first institution to medically train women, founded in 1848.<ref>http://www.bumc.bu.edu/Dept/Content.aspx?DepartmentID=37&PageID=7562{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>{{dead link|date=June 2012}}  The institution was reformed and renamed in 1873 when Boston University merged with the New England Female Medical College.  Upon the renaming, BUSM continued its progressive tradition of medical education for both men and women, and for all races and ethnicities.

== Recent class profile ==
In the autumn of 2010, BUSM's first year medical students were 52% female, and 19% were of an ethnicity that is under-represented in medicine.<ref name="classprofile">{{cite web|url=http://www.bumc.bu.edu/admissions/welcome/classprofile/ |title=Class Profile » Admissions » BUMC |work=Bumc.bu.edu |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2012-06-19}}</ref>  Out of the 178 matriculated students, 120 are in the traditional [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) program.  Seven students were enrolled in the [[MD/PhD]] program, and the rest were in some other type of non-traditional MD track. BUSM also offers joint degrees with other Boston University graduate schools, allowing the medical students to earn an MD degree with a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA), [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH), or [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]].

Over 11,000 people applied for admission to BUSM in 2010, and 171 MD students and 7 MD/PhD students were in the entering class, from 37 states and 19 countries. The acceptance rate for the incoming class was 4.3%. Students' ages ranged from 20 to 40.<ref name="classprofile"/>
