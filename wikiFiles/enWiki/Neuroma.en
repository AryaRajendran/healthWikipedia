A '''neuroma''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|n|juː|ˈ|r|oʊ|m|ə}}) is a growth or [[tumor]] of nerve tissue.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000071874|neuroma}}</ref> (''Neuro-'' is from the Greek for ''nerve'' and the suffix ''-oma'' denotes ''swelling''.) Just as the Latin word for swelling (''[[tumor]]'') is now restricted to [[neoplasia]]s, the equivalent Greek suffix ''-oma'' has shared in that fate.  Thus, the typical modern usage of ''neuroma'' is for nerve tumors.  However, many of the older, more general uses persist.<ref>{{eMedicineDictionary|Neuroma}}</ref>

== Neoplastic neuromas ==

Neoplastic neuromas are [[tumor]]s of nerves, although the term can also be applied more generally for a tumor of nervous system tissue.  They can be derived from a variety of the cell types that constitute nervous tissue, including [[glial cells]] and [[neurons]], and can be either [[benign]] or [[malignant]] (i.e. cancerous).  Many mistakenly assume that the Greek stem ''neur'' in ''neuroma'' refers to neurons rather than to nerves.  This is not the case, and in fact, most instances of the word refer to non-neuronal tissue.

* [[Neurinoma]] (Neurilemmoma) - a benign slow growing tumor of the [[neurolemma]] (myelin sheath) of a nerve fibre.
** [[Acoustic neuroma]] - a tumor of the [[acoustic nerve]]
* [[Ganglioneuroma]] could be considered a type of neuroma, though it is not a nerve sheath tumor.

== Non-neoplastic neuromas ==
In its most general sense, ''neuroma'' can be applied to any swelling of a nerve.  Thus, there are a variety of usages that don't refer to [[neoplasia|neoplastic]] tumors.

* [[Traumatic neuroma]] follows different forms of nerve injury (often as a result of surgery). They occur at the end of injured nerve fibres as a form of ineffective, unregulated nerve regeneration; it occurs most commonly near a scar, either superficially (skin, subcutaneous fat) or deep (e.g., after a [[cholecystectomy]]). They are often very painful. It is also known as "'''scar neuroma'''," or "'''pseudoneuroma'''".

* [[Morton's neuroma]] (a [[mononeuropathy]] of the foot) is another example of the older, more general usage of ''neuroma''.  Some prefer the term "Morton's metatarsalgia", thus avoiding the term ''neuroma'' and its association with tumors.<ref>{{GPnotebook|-664076278|Morton's metatarsalgia}}</ref>
