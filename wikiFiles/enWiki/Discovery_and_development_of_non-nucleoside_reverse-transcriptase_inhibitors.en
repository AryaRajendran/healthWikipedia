=== Function ===
Reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme that controls the replication of the [[genome|genetic material]] of HIV and other retroviruses.<ref name=Ivatec_2008/> The enzyme has two enzymatic functions. Firstly it acts as a [[polymerase]] where it [[transcription (genetics)|transcribes]] the single-stranded [[RNA]] [[genome]] into single-stranded [[DNA]] and subsequently builds a complementary strand of DNA. This provides a DNA double helix which can be integrated in the host cell's [[chromosome]].<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/> Secondly it has [[RNase H|ribonuclease H]] (Rnase H) activity as it degrades the RNA strand of RNA-DNA intermediate that forms during viral DNA synthesis.<ref name=Prajapati_2009>{{Citation | last1 = Prajapati | first1 = D.G. | last2 = Ramajayam | first2 = R. | last3 = Yadav | first3 = M.R. | last4 = Giridhar | first4 = R. | title = The search for potent, small molecule NNRTIs: A review | journal = Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 17 | issue = 16 |pages = 5744–5762 | year = 2009 | url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6TF8-4WNRJYT-1-31&_cdi=5220&_user=5915660&_orig=search&_coverDate=08%2F15%2F2009&_sk=999829983&view=c&wchp=dGLbVtz-zSkWb&md5=93a1aeea620b65dc46b99a12d4c6790f&ie=/sdarticle.pdf | doi = 10.1016/j.bmc.2009.06.060}}</ref>

=== Structure ===
The HIV-1 RT is an asymmetric 1000-[[amino acid]] heterodimer composed of p66 (560 amino acids) and p51 subunits (440 amino acids).<ref name=Ivatec_2008/> The p66 subunit has two domains, a polymerase and ribonuclease H. The polymerase domain contains four [[subdomains]], which have been termed “fingers”, “palm”, “thumb” and “connection” and it is often compared to a right hand (figure 1).<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/> The role of the p66 subunit is to carry out the activity of RT whereas it contains the [[active site]]s of the enzyme. The p51 is believed to play mainly a structural role.<ref name=Prajapati_2009/>

== Binding and pharmacophore==
Despite the chemical diversity of NNRTIs they all bind at the same site in the RT. The binding occurs [[allosterically]] in a [[hydrophobic]] pocket located approximately 10 [[Ångström|Å]] from the [[catalytic]] site in the palm domain of the p66 subunit site of the enzyme.<ref name=Ivatec_2008/><ref name="de Béthune_2009"/> The NNRTI binding pocket (NNIBP) contains five [[aromatic]] (Tyr-181, Tyr-188, Phe-227 and Trp-229), six hydrophobic (Pro-59, Leu-100, Val-106, Val-179, Leu-234 and Pro-236) and five [[hydrophilic]] (Lys-101, Lys-103, Ser-105, Asp-132 and Glu-224) amino acids that belong to the p66 subunit and additional two amino acids (Ile-135 and Glu-138) belonging to the p51 subunit.<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/> Each NNRTI interacts with different amino acid residues in the NNIBP.<ref name=Das_2005>{{Citation | last1 = Das | first1 = K. | last2 = Lewi | first2 = P.J. | last3 = Hughes | first3 = S.H. | last4 = Arnold | first4 = E. | title = [[Crystallography]] and the design of anti-AIDS drugs: [[Chemical structure|Conformational]] flexibility and positional adaptability are important in the design of non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors | journal = Progress in Biophysics & Molecular Biology | volume = 88 | issue = 2 |pages = 209–231 | year = 2005 | url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6TBN-4DCD9DW-1-T&_cdi=5147&_user=713789&_orig=search&_coverDate=06%2F01%2F2005&_sk=999119997&view=c&wchp=dGLbVlW-zSkWA&md5=3e15a8856bcc563f8436b7e33ed015e2&ie=/sdarticle.pdf | doi = 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2004.07.001}}</ref>

[[Image:nevirapine-wing.svg|thumb|right|200px|'''Figure 2''' Chemical structure of nevirapine and the two wings.]]
An important factor in the binding of the first generation NNRTIs, such as nevirapine, is the butterfly-like shape. Despite their chemical diversity they assume very similar butterfly-like shape.<ref name=Das_2005/> Two aromatic rings of NNRTIs conform within the enzyme to resemble the wings of a butterfly (figure 2).

The NNIBP is [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] and the [[Chemical structure|conformation]] depends on the size, specific chemical composition and binding mode of the NNRTI. The total structure of RT has segmental [[flexibility]] that depends on the nature of the bound NNRTI. It's important for the inhibitor to have flexibility to be able to bind in the modified pockets of a mutant target. Inhibitor flexibility may not affect the inhibitor-target interactions.<ref name=Das_2005/>

In addition to this proposed primary mechanism of action it has been shown that the NNRTIs have other mechanisms of action and interfere with various steps in the reverse transcriptase reaction.<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/> It has been suggested that the inhibition of reverse transcription by the NNRTIs may be due to effects on the RT Rnase H activity and/or template/[[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] binding. Some NNRTIs interfere with HIV-1 [[Fusion protein|Gag-Pol]] polyprotein processing by inhibiting the late stage of HIV-1 replication. 
It is important to gain profound understanding of the various mechanism of action of the NNRTIs in order to develop next-generation NNRTIs and for understanding the mechanism of drug resistance.<ref name=Sluis-Cremer_2008/>

== Drug discovery and design==
The development of effective anti-HIV drugs is difficult due to wide variations in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The perfect anti-HIV drug chemical should be effective against drug resistance [[mutations|mutation]]. Understanding the target RT enzyme and its structure, mechanism of drug action and the consequence of drug resistance mutations provide useful information which can be helpful to design more effective NNRTIs. The RT enzyme can undergo change due to mutations that can disturb NNRTI binding.<ref name=Das_2005/>

=== Discovery ===
The first two classes of compounds that were identified as NNRTIs were the 1-(2-2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)-6-(phenylthio)thymine (HEPT) and tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jkj][1,4]benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) compounds. The discovery of the TIBO compounds led to the definition of the NNRTI class in the late 1980s<ref name="De Clercq_2005"/> when they were unexpectedly found to inhibit RT. This finding initiated researches on mechanism of action for these compounds. The HEPT compounds were described before the TIBO compounds and were originally believed to be NRTIs. Later it was discovered that they shared common mechanism of action with the TIBO compounds.<ref name=De_Clercq_2009/><ref name="de Béthune_2009"/> Both the HEPT and TIBO compounds were first to be identified as highly specific and potent HIV-1 RT inhibitors, not active against other RTs.<ref name=De_Clercq_2009/> These compounds do not interrupt the cellular or [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] DNA synthesis. The specificity of the NNRTIs for HIV-1 is considered the hallmark of the NNRTI drug class.<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/>

=== Development ===

==== First generation NNRTIs ====
After the discovery of HEPT and TIBO, compounds screening methods were used to develop BI-RG-587, the first NNRTI commonly known as nevirapine. Like HEPT and TIBO, nevirapine blocked viral RT activity by non-competitive inhibition (with respect to dNTP binding). This reinforced the idea that the new class of anti-HIV inhibitors was inhibiting the activity of RT but not at the active site. Several molecular families of NNRTIs have emerged following screening and evolution of many molecules.<ref name=Basavapathruni_2007/> 
Three NNRTI compounds of the first generation have been approved by the FDA for treating HIV-1 infection. Nevirapine was approved in 1996, delavirdine in 1997 and efavirenz in 1998 (table 1). Two of these drugs, nevirapine and efavirenz, are cornerstones of first line HAART while delavirdine is hardly used nowadays.<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/><ref name=Basavapathruni_2007/> The structure of these three drugs show the wide array of rings, substituents, and bonds that allow activity against HIV-1 RT. This diversity demonstrates why so many non-nucleosides have been synthesised but doesn't explain why only three drugs have reached the market. The main problem has been the potency of these compounds to develop resistance.<ref name=Basavapathruni_2007/>

===== Development from α-APA to ITU =====
[[Image:alpha-APA-ITU.svg|thumb|300px|right|'''Figure 4''' The development from α-APA to ITU]]
[[Crystal structure]] analysis showed that the first generation NNRTIs  (for example TIBO, nevirapine and α-APA) bind HIV-1 RT in a “butterfly-like” conformation. These first generation NNRTIs were vulnerable against the common drug-resistance mutations like Tyr-181C and Tyr-188L/H. This triggered the need for finding new and more effective NNRTIs. ITU (imidoylthiourea), a promising series of NNRTIs emerged from α-APA analogs (figure 4).  The ITU compounds were obtained by extending the linker that binds the aryl side groups of the α-APA. A potent ITU compound, R100943, was obtained by an arrangement of the chemical composition of the side groups based on [[structure-activity relationship]]s (SAR). A crystal structure of the HIV-1/R100943 complex demonstrated that ITU compounds are more flexible than α-APA compound. The ITU compounds showed distinct mode of binding where they bound with "horseshoe" or "U" mode. The 2,6-dichlorophenyl part of R100943 which corresponds chemically to the wing II 2,6-dibromophenyl part of the α-APA occupied the wing I part in the NNIBP whereas the 4-cyanoanilino part of R100943 occupies the wing II position in the NNIBP.<ref name=Das_2005/><ref name=Ludovici_2001a>{{Citation | last1 = Ludovici | first1 = D.W. | last2 = Kukla | first2 = M.J. | last3 = Grous | first3 = P.G.| last4 = Krishnan | first4 = S. | last5 = Andries | first5 = K. | last6 = de Be´thune | first6 = M.-P. et al. | title = Evolution of anti-HIV drug candidates.

R100943 inhibited HIV-1 and was considerably effective against a number of key NNRTI-resistant mutants like G190A mutation, which caused high-level resistance to loviride (α-APA) and nevirapine.  G190A mutation was thought to cause resistance by occupying a part of the binding pocket that would otherwise be filled by the linker part of the butterfly shaped NNRTIs. R100943, in the horseshoe mode of binding, is located at a distance of approximately 6.0 Å from G190. When compared with nevirapine and loviride which bind in the butterfly shape the ITU [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] revealed improved activity against Tyr-181C and Tyr-188L mutants. A structural study suggested that a potent TIBO compound could partly supplement for the effects of the Tyr-181C mutation by moving itself in the non-nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket (NNIBP) of the mutant RT. In this context, R100943 has  torsional freedom that enables the conformational alternations of the NNRTI. This torsional freedom could be used by the ITU derivate to bind to a mutated NNIBP and thus compensating for the effects of a resistance mutation. Nevertheless, the potency of R100943 against HIV-1 resistant mutants was not adequate for it to be considered as an effective [[Drug discovery|drug candidate]]. Additionally,  the chemical stability of the imidoylthiourea part of the ITU derivative was not favorable for an oral drug.<ref name=Das_2005/><ref name=Hsiou_1998>{{Citation | last1 = Hsiou | first1 =  Y. | last2 =  Das| first2 = K. | last3 =  Ding | first3 = J. | last4 =  Clark Jr | first4 =  A.D. | last5 = Kleim | first5 =  J.-P.| last6 = RoÈ sner | first6 = M.

===== Development from ITU to DATA =====
[[Image:Etravirine from DAPY.svg|thumb|150px|right|'''Figure 5''' Chemical substitutions of the DAPY series were made to obtain the highly potent etravirine]]
Changes in the imidoylthiourea complexes led to the synthesis of a new
class of compounds, diaryltriazine (DATA). In these compounds, the
thiourea part of the ITU compounds was replaced by a triazine ring. The
DATA compounds were more potent than the ITU compounds against common
NNRTI resistant mutant strains. R106168, a prototype DATA compound, was
rather easy to synthesize. Multiple substitutions were made at different
positions on all of the three rings and on the linkers connecting the
rings. In the pocket, most of the DATA derivatives conformed a horseshoe
conformation. The two wings in R106168 (2,6-dichlorobenzyl and
4-cyanoanilino) occupied positions in the pocket similar to that of the
two wings of the derivatives of ITU. The central part of the DATA
compounds, in which the triazine ring replaced the thiourea group of ITU
derivatives, is positioned between the side chains of L100 and V179. This
removed a number of torstional degrees of freedom in the central part
while keeping the flexibility between the triazine ring and the wings.<ref name=Das_2005/><ref name=Ludovici_2001b>{{Citation | last1 = Ludovici | first1 = D.W. | last2 = Kavash | first2 =  R.W.| last3 =  Kukla | first3 = M.J. | last4 =  Ho | first4 = C.Y. | last5 = Ye | first5 = H. | last6 = De Corte | first6 = B.L  et al. | title = Evolution of Anti-HIV Drug CandidatesPart 2: Diaryltriazine (DATA) Analogues | journal = Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters | volume = 11 | issue = 17 |pages = 2229–2234  | year = 2001 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6TF9-43TFRM7-4-C&_cdi=5221&_user=713789&_orig=search&_coverDate=09%2F03%2F2001&_sk=999889982&view=c&wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkzV&md5=99ae96051a49b7e84cc7789f6b66a6e2&ie=/sdarticle.pdf | doi = 10.1016/S0960-894X(01)00411-5  }}</ref>
Chemical substitution or modification in the three-aromatic-ring backbone
of the DATA compounds had substantial effect on the activity. R120393, a DATA analog, was designed with a chloroindole part in wing I to expand
interactions with the side chain of conserved W229 of the polymerase
primer grip loop. R120393 had similar effect as R106168 against most of
the NNRTI-resistant mutants.  The cloroindole part interacted with the
hydrophobic core of the pocket and influenced the binding mode of the
R120393 so it went deeper into the pocket compared to the wing I position
of other DATA analogs. Crystal structures showed that the DATA compounds
could bind the NNIBP in different conformations. The capability to bind in
multible modes made the NNRTIs stronger against drug-resistance mutations.
Variability between the inhibitors could be seen when the chemical
composition, size of wing I and the two linker groups connecting the rings
were altered. The potency of the NNRTIs changed when the [[triazine]] nitrogen
atoms were substituted with carbons.<ref name=Das_2005/>

==== Next generation NNRTIs ====
Researchers used multi-disciplinary approach to design NNRTIs with better resistance profile and an increased genetic barrier to the development of resistance.<ref name=Das_2005/>  A new class of compounds, [[diarylpyrimidines|diarylpyrimide]] (DAPY), were discovered with the replacement of the central [[triazine]] ring from the DATA compounds, with a [[pyrimidine]]. This new class was more effective against drug resistant HIV-1 strains than the corresponding DATA analogs. The replacement enabled substitutions to the CH-group at the 5-position of the central aromatic ring. One of the first DAPY compounds, dapivirine (with R<sub>1</sub>= 2,4,6-trimethylanilino, R<sub>2</sub> = R<sub>3</sub> = H and Y = NH) was found to be effective against drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. Systematic chemical substitutions were made at the R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> and Y positions to find new DAPY derivatives. This led to the discovery of etravirine which has a bromine substitution at the 5-position (R<sub>3</sub>) of the [[pyrimidine]] ring (with R<sub>1</sub> = 2,6-dimethyl-4-cyanoanilino, R<sub>2</sub> = NH<sub>2</sub> and Y = O) (figure 5).<ref name=Das_2005/> Etravirine was discovered by researchers at the Jansen Research Foundation and Tibotec and approved in 2008 by the FDA. It is used in treatment-expirenced adult patients with HIV infection that is [[multiple drug resistance|multidrug resistant]] in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.<ref name=Schiller_2009>{{Citation | last1 = Schiller | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Youssef-Bessler | first2 = M. | title = Etravirine: A Second-Generation Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) Active Against NNRTI-Resistant Strains of HIV | journal = Clinical Therapeutics | volume = 31 | issue = 4 |pages = 692–704 | year = 2009 | url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6VRS-4W90NCX-2-1&_cdi=6242&_user=713789&_orig=search&_coverDate=04%2F30%2F2009&_sk=999689995&view=c&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkWz&md5=76bd50ba18a9397a581894466b6ed255&ie=/sdarticle.pdf | doi = 10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.04.020 | pmid = 19446143}}</ref>

== Resistance ==
When treating infection, whether bacterial or viral, there is always a risk of the infectious agent to develop drug resistance. The treatment of HIV infection is especially susceptible to drug resistance which is a serious clinical concern in the chemotherapeutic treatment of the infection. Drug resistant HIV-strains emerge if the virus is able to replicate in the presence of the antiretroviral drugs.<ref name=Das_2005/>

NNRTI-resistant HIV-strains have the occurring mutations mainly in and around the NNIBP affecting the NNRTI binding directly by altering the size, shape and [[Chemical polarity|polarity]] on different areas of the pocket or by affecting, indirectly, the access to the pocket.<ref name=Das_2005/> Those mutations are primarily noted in domains which span amino acids 98-108, 178-190 or 225-238 of the p66 subunit. The most frequent mutations observed in viruses isolated from patients who have been on a failing NNRTI containing chemotherapy are Lys-103N and Tyr-181C. NNRTI resistance has been linked to over 40 amino acid substitutions [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]].<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/>

Antiretroviral drugs are never used in monotherapy due to rapid resistance development. The highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced in 1996.<ref name=Sosnik_2009/> The treatment regimen combines three drugs from at least two different classes of antiretroviral drugs.<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/>

The advance of etravirine over other NNRTIs is that multiple mutations are required for the development of drug resistance. The drug has also shown activity against viruses with common NNRTI resistance associated mutations and [[cross-resistance]] mutations.<ref name=Schiller_2009/>

== Current status ==
Four drugs in the class of NNRTIs have been approved by regulatory authorities. These are the first generation NNRTIs nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz and the next generation NNRTI etravirine. Several other NNRTIs underwent clinical development but were discontinued due to unfavourable [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]], efficacy and/or safety factors.
Currently there are four other NNRTIs undergoing clinical development, [[rilpivirine]], IDX899, RDEA-428 and lersivirine (table 2).

===Rilpivirine===
Rilpivirine is a DAPY compound like etravirine and was discovered when further optimization within this family of NNRTIs was conducted. The resistance profile and the genetic barrier to the development of resistance is comparable to etravirine ''in vitro''. The advantage of rilpivirine over etravirine is a better [[bioavailability]] and it is easier to formulate than etravirine. Etravirine has required extensive chemical formulation work due to poor [[solubility]] and bioavailability.<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/> Rilpivirine was undergoing phase III [[clinical trial]]s in the end of 2009.<ref>[http://www.tibotec.com/bgdisplay.jhtml?itemname=HIV_tmc278 http://www.tibotec.com]</ref> Rilpivirine was approved by the FDA for HIV therapy in May 2011.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm256087.htm</ref> A fixed-dose drug combining rilpivirine with emtricitabine and tenofovir, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in August 2011 under the brand name Complera.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/HIVandAIDSActivities/ucm267592.htm</ref>

===RDEA806===
In 2007 a new family of triazole NNRTIs was presented by researchers from the pharmaceutical company Ardea Biosciences. The selected candidate from the screening executed was RDEA806 belonging to the family of [[triazole]]s. It has similar resistance profile against selected NNRTI resistant HIV-1 strains to other next generation NNRTIs.<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/> The candidate entered phase IIb clinical trials in the end of 2009.<ref>[http://www.ardeabio.com/viral.html http://www.ardebio.com/]</ref>

===IDX899===
IDX899 is another next generation NNRTI developed by Idenix Pharmaceuticals. It belongs to the family of 3-phosphoindoles. In vitro studies have shown comparable resistance profile to that of the other next generation NNRTIs.<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/> On November 3, 2009 the candidate entered phase II clinical trials.<ref>[http://ir.idenix.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=611095 http://ir.idenix.com/]</ref>

===Lersivirine (UK-453061)===
Lersivirine belongs to the [[pyrazole]] family and is another next generation NNRTI in clinical trials developed by the pharmaceutical company [[ViiV Healthcare]]. The resistance profile is similar to that of other next generation NNRTIs. In the end of 2009 lersivirine was in phase IIb.<ref name="de Béthune_2009"/>
In February 2013, ViiV Healthcare announced a stop of the development program investigating lersivirine.<ref>[http://www.hivandhepatitis.com/hiv-aids/hiv-aids-topics/hiv-treatment/3963-viiv-announces-halt-to-lersivirine-development http://www.hivandhepatitis.com/]</ref>
