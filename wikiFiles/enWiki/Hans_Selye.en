'''János (Hans) Hugo Bruno Selye'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}, [[Order of Canada|CC]] ({{lang-hu|Selye János}}) (January 26, 1907 — October 16, 1982) was a pioneering Hungarian [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]]. He conducted much important scientific work on the hypothetical non-specific response of an organism to [[stressor]]s. While he did not recognize all of the many aspects of [[glucocorticoid]]s, Selye was aware of their role in the stress response. Some commentators{{Who|date=September 2010}} consider him the first to demonstrate the existence of [[Stress (biological)|biological stress]].

==Biography==

Selye was born in Vienna, [[Austria-Hungary]] on 26 January 1907.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=Hans Selye |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9001506/Hans-Selye |accessdate=2008-06-12 |edition=2008 |date= |year= |month= |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |volume= |location= |id= |isbn= |doi= |pages= |quote=}}</ref> He grew up in [[Komárom]], Hungary and the Hungarian language university in that town bears his name. He became a Doctor of Medicine and Chemistry in [[Prague]] in 1929, went to [[Johns Hopkins University]] on a [[Rockefeller|Rockefeller Foundation]] [[Scholarship]] in 1931 and then went to [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] where he started researching the issue of stress in 1936. In 1945 he joined the [[Université de Montréal]] where he had 40 assistants and worked with 15,000 lab animals. [[Kantha]] (1992), in a survey of an elite group of scientists who have authored over 1,000 research publications, identified Selye as one who had published 1,700 research papers, 15 monographs and 7 popular books. He died on October 16, 1982 in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].
He was a nominee to the Nobel prize for the first time in 1949.<ref>The Nomination Database for the

==Work on stress==

His last inspiration for ''[[general adaptation syndrome]]'' (GAS, a theory of [[Stress (biological)|stress]]) came from an endocrinological experiment in which he injected mice with extracts of various organs. He at first believed he had discovered a new hormone, but was proved wrong when every irritating substance he injected produced the same symptoms (swelling of the [[adrenal cortex]], atrophy of the [[thymus]], gastric and duodenal ulcers). This, paired with his observation that people with different diseases exhibit similar symptoms, led to his description of the effects of "noxious agents" as he at first called it. He later coined the term "[[Stress (biological)|stress]]", which has been accepted into the lexicon of various other languages.

Selye has acknowledged the influence of [[Claude Bernard]] (who developed the idea of ''[[milieu intérieur]]'') and [[Walter Cannon]]'s "[[homeostasis]]". Selye conceptualized the physiology of stress as having two components: a set of responses which he called the "[[general adaptation syndrome]]", and the development of a pathological state from ongoing, unrelieved stress.

Selye discovered and documented that stress differs from other physical responses in that stress is stressful whether one receives good or bad news, whether the impulse is positive or negative. He called negative stress "[[Distress (medicine)|distress]]" and positive stress "[[eustress]]". The system whereby the body copes with stress, the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) system, was also first described by Selye. He also pointed to an "alarm state", a "resistance state", and an "exhaustion state", largely referring to glandular states. Later he developed the idea of two "reservoirs" of stress resistance, or alternatively stress energy.

Selye wrote ''The Stress of Life'' (1956), ''From Dream to Discovery: On Being a Scientist'' (1964) and ''Stress without Distress'' (1974). He worked as a professor and director of the Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery at the [[Université de Montréal]]. In 1975 He  created the International Institute of Stress and in 1979, Dr. Selye and Arthur Antille started the Hans Selye Foundation. Later Selye and 8 Nobel Laureates founded the Canadian Institute of Stress.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stresscanada.org |title=Welcome To The Canadian Institute Of Stress |publisher=Stresscanada.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref> 

In 1968 he was made a [[Companion of the Order of Canada]]. 

In 2004, Selye's aim of making evidence-based, practice-focused training for health and workplace professionals available globally was realized in the launch of training for Certified Stress & Wellness Consultants via the [[World Wide Web]].<ref>http://www.stresscanada.org/cswbrief.html</ref> Selye was one of the highly productive scientists in the 20th century, with over 1,000 research publications, according a study by Kantha (1992).
