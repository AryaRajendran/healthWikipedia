'''Clitoral erection''' is a physiological phenomenon where the [[clitoris]] becomes enlarged and firm.  Clitoral erection is the result of a complex interaction of psychological, neural, vascular and endocrine factors, and is usually, though not exclusively, associated with [[sexual arousal]].

==Physiology==
[[Image:Clitoris inner anatomy.gif|thumb|right|The internal anatomy of the human [[vulva]], with the [[clitoral hood]] and [[labia minora]] indicated as lines.]]
Clitoral erection occurs when the [[Corpus cavernosum clitoridis|corpora cavernosa]], two expandable [[erectile]] structures, become engorged with venous blood. This may result from any of various [[physiology|physiological]] stimuli, including [[sexual stimulation]] and [[sexual arousal]]. The extrusion of the [[glans clitoridis]] and thinning of the skin enhances [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensitivity]] to physical contact. After a female has [[orgasm]]ed, the erection usually ends, but this may take time.

===Causes===
The clitoris is the [[homology (biology)|homologue]] of the [[penis]] in the female. The part visible on the outside varies in size from a few millimeters to one centimeter and is located hidden in the [[Labia majora|upper labial]] fold. Any type of motion can increase [[blood flow]] to this tiny organ and this results in excessive [[secretion]]s which lubricate the [[vagina]].<ref>[http://www.clitoral-stimulation.com/erection.html Clitoral erection and stimulation] 2010-02-09</ref> There are many ways to stimulate the clitoris.

==Signs of clitoral stimulation==
The main sign of clitoris stimulation is [[vaginal lubrication]]. Other signs may include nipple erection, and prolonged body relaxation.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Shape and size ==
An erect clitoris can take on a number of different shapes and angles, ranging from small and embedded, to large and protruding.  Generally, the size of an erect clitoris is fixed throughout post-[[puberty|pubescent]] life.

==Priapism==
A clitoral erection that does not subside is a form of [[priapism]] called [[clitorism]], a painful condition where the clitoris will experience recurring erections.

==Neurovascular mechanism of clitoral erection==
The clitoris consists of an external short head attached to a long body which is internally located. The body of the clitoris is surrounded by bulky [[erectile tissue]] on either side. This bulk contains muscles and is richly innervated with [[sensory nerve]]s. While the penis is an external organ which is distended, the clitoris is small and is an internal structure. The major nerve which produces sensations to the clitoris is a branch of the [[pudendal nerve]],  also known as the dorsal nerve of the clitoris.<ref>Sydney Morning Herald.
