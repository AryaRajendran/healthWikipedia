'''Pancreatitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[pancreas]].  It has several causes and symptoms and requires immediate medical attention. It occurs when [[Digestive enzyme|pancreatic enzymes]] (especially [[trypsin]]) that [[Period of digestion|digest]] food are activated in the pancreas instead of the small intestine. It may be [[acute pancreatitis|acute]]—beginning suddenly and lasting a few days, or [[chronic pancreatitis|chronic]]—occurring over many years.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common symptoms of pancreatitis are severe upper [[abdomen|abdominal]] burning pain [[referred pain|radiating]] to the back, [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]] that is worsened with eating. The physical examination will vary depending on severity and presence of [[internal bleeding]]. [[Blood pressure]] may be elevated by pain or decreased by [[dehydration]] or bleeding. [[Heart rate|Heart]] and [[respiratory rate]]s are often elevated. The abdomen is usually [[tenderness (medicine)|tender]] but to a lesser degree than the pain itself. As is common in abdominal disease, [[bowel sounds]] may be reduced from reflex [[ileus|bowel paralysis]]. [[Fever]] or [[jaundice]] may be present. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to [[diabetes]] or [[pancreatic cancer]]. Unexplained weight loss may occur from a lack of [[pancreatic enzyme]]s hindering [[digestion]].

==Causes==
Eighty percent of cases of pancreatitis are caused by alcohol and [[gallstone]]s. Gallstones are the single most common [[Etiology (medicine)|etiology]] of acute pancreatitis.<ref>{{cite web |author=NIDDK |title=Pancreatitis |month=July |year=2008 |work=National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse |publisher=U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases |url=http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/pancreatitis/ |id=08–1596 |ref=harv}}</ref> [[Alcohol]] is the single most common etiology of chronic pancreatitis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/pancreatitis-000122.htm |title=Pancreatitis |publisher=A.D.A.M., Inc. |date= |accessdate=2013-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Apte MV, Pirola RC, Wilson JS |title=Pancreas: alcoholic pancreatitis—it's the alcohol, stupid |journal=Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=321–2 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19494819 |doi=10.1038/nrgastro.2009.84 |laysummary=[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706319 at Medscape Today]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yadav D., Hawes R.

Some medications are commonly associated with pancreatitis, most commonly [[corticosteroids]] such as [[prednisolone]], but also including the [[HIV]] drugs [[didanosine]] and [[pentamidine]], [[diuretics]], the anticonvulsant [[valproic acid]], the chemotherapeutic agents [[L-asparaginase]] and [[azathioprine]], [[estrogen]] by way of [[hypertriglyceridemia|increased blood triglycerides]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Smith, Emma; Murray Longmore; Wilkinson, Ian; Tom Turmezei; Chee Kay Cheung |title=Oxford handbook of clinical medicine |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2007 |page=584 |isbn=0-19-856837-1 |edition=7th }}</ref> cholesterol-lowering [[statins]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and the antihyperglycemic agents like [[metformin]],<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11824780</ref> [[vildagliptin]],<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23306341</ref>  [[sitagliptin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Matveyenko AV, Dry S, Cox HI, ''et al.'' |title=Beneficial endocrine but adverse exocrine effects of sitagliptin in the human islet amyloid polypeptide transgenic rat model of type 2 diabetes: interactions with metformin |journal=Diabetes |volume=58 |issue=7 |pages=1604–15 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19403868 |pmc=2699878 |doi=10.2337/db09-0058 |url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/58/7/1604.full}}</ref> It may be noted here that the drugs which are used to treat conditions which are themselves associated with increased events of pancreatitis may also be incidentally linked to pancreatitis. Examples include statins in dyslipidemia and gliptins in diabetes. 

There is an [[hereditary pancreatitis|inherited form]] that results in the activation of [[trypsinogen]] within the pancreas, leading to [[autodigestion]]. Involved genes may include [[Trypsin&nbsp;1]], which codes for trypsinogen, [[SPINK1]], which codes for a [[trypsin inhibitor]], or [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]].<ref>{{cite web | author=D. Whitcomb|year=2006 | title=Genetic Testing for Pancreatitis|url=http://www.touchalimentarydisease.com/articles.cfm?article_id=6374&level=2}}</ref>

Other common causes include [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[mumps]], [[autoimmune pancreatitis|autoimmune disease]], [[scorpion]] stings, [[Hypercalcemia|high blood calcium]], high blood triglycerides, [[hypothermia]], and [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]] (ERCP).
[[Pancreas divisum]] is a common [[congenital malformation]] of the pancreas that may underlie some recurrent cases. Pregnancy can be a cause, possibly by increasing blood triglycerides. [[Diabetes mellitus type&nbsp;2]] is associated with a 2.8-fold higher risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Noel RA, Braun DK, Patterson RE, Bloomgren GL |title=Increased risk of acute pancreatitis and biliary disease observed in patients with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=834–8 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19208917 |pmc=2671118 |doi=10.2337/dc08-1755 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/5/834.full}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Diagnostic criteria|Diagnosing]] pancreatitis requires two of the following:
* Characteristic abdominal pain
* Blood [[amylase]] or [[lipase]] will be 4-6 times higher than the normal variations, but this will be dependent on the laboratory that is testing the blood.
* Abdominal ultrasound is generally performed first, which is advantageous for the diagnosis of the causes of the pancreas, for example, detecting gallstones, diagnosing alcoholic fatty liver (combined with history of alcohol consumption). They are both the main causes of pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasound also shows an inflamed pancreas clearly. It is convenient, simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Lawrence W. Tierney, Stephen J. McPhee | title = Medicine | publisher = McGraw-Hill |ISBN =0-07-144441-6 }}</ref>
* Characteristic [[CT scan]]<ref name="pmid17032204">{{cite journal |author=Banks P, Freeman M |title=Practice guidelines in acute pancreatitis |journal=Am J Gastroenterol |volume=101 |year=2006 |pmid=17032204 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00856.x |issue=2379–400 |pages=2379–400}}</ref>

[[Cholecystitis]], [[Peptic ulcer#Complications|perforated peptic ulcer]], [[bowel infarction]], and [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] can mimic pancreatitis by causing similar abdominal pain and elevated enzymes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The diagnosis can be confirmed by [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] and/or CT.

==Treatment==
The treatment of pancreatitis is supportive and depends on severity. [[Morphine]] generally is suitable for pain control. There is a claim that morphine may constrict the [[sphincter of Oddi]], but this is controversial. There are no clinical studies to suggest that morphine can aggravate or cause pancreatitis or cholecystitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Helm JF, Venu RP, Geenen JE, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of morphine on the human sphincter of Oddi |journal=Gut |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=1402–7 |year=1988 |month=October |pmid=3197985 |pmc=1434014 |doi= |url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3197985}}

The treatment that is received for acute pancreatitis will depend on whether the diagnosis is for the mild form of the condition, which causes no complications, or the severe form, which can cause serious complications.

===Mild acute pancreatitis===
The treatment of mild acute pancreatitis is successfully carried out by admission to a general hospital ward. Eating should not be allowed until pancreatic inflammation has resolved, which usually takes around five days, as the digestion process places strain on the pancreas. Because pancreatitis can cause lung damage and affect normal lung function, oxygen is usually delivered through breathing tubes that are connected via the nose. The tubes can then be removed after a few days once it is clear that the condition is improving. Dehydration may result during an episode of acute pancreatitis, so fluids will be provided intravenously.
The pain associated with even mild cases of acute pancreatitis can be severe, so it may require quite a strong, opiate-based painkiller.

===Severe acute pancreatitis===
If diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis, they will need to be admitted to a high dependency unit or [[intensive care unit]].
It is likely that the levels of fluids inside the body will have dropped significantly as it diverts bodily fluids and nutrients in an attempt to repair the pancreas. The drop in fluid levels can lead to a reduction in the volume of blood within the body, which is known as [[hypovolemic]] shock.
Hypovolemic shock can be life-threatening as it can very quickly starve the body of the oxygen-rich blood that it needs to survive. To avoid going into hypovolemic shock, fluids will be pumped intravenously. Oxygen will be supplied through tubes attached to the nose and ventilation equipment may be used to assist with breathing. Feeding tubes may be used to provide nutrients, while painkillers can help to relieve the pain.
As with mild acute pancreatitis, it will be necessary to treat the underlying cause.
If the cause is gallstones, it is likely that an [[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|ERCP]] procedure or removal of your gallbladder will be recommended. For more information about ERCP, see [[Acute pancreatitis#ERCP|Acute pancreatitis - ERCP]]. If the cause is alcohol use, stopping drinking and receiving treatment for alcohol dependency will be recommended (as discussed above).
Though, as mentioned above, even if the underlying cause is not alcohol-related, consumption should still be avoided for at least six months as this can cause further damage to the pancreas during the recovery process.<ref>E Medicine Health , Jerry R. Balentine, DO, FACEP , Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD, Chief Medical Editor</ref> Oral intake, especially fats, is generally restricted at first. [[fluid replacement|Fluids]] and [[electrolyte#Rehydration|electrolytes]] are replaced [[intravenous]]ly. Nutritional support should be initiated via tube feeding to surpass the portion of the digestive tract most effected by secreted pancreatic enzymes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Muddana V, Whitcomb DC, Papachristou GI |title=Current management and novel insights in acute pancreatitis |journal=Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=435–44 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19673630 |doi=10.1586/egh.09.27 |url=http://www.future-drugs.com/doi/abs/10.1586/egh.09.27}}</ref> The underlying cause should also be treated (targeting gallstones, discontinuing medications, cessation of alcohol etc.) The patient is monitored for complications.

==Prognosis==
Severe acute pancreatitis has [[mortality rate]]s around 2-9%, higher where [[necrosis]] of the pancreas has occurred.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Munoz A, Katerndahl DA |title=Diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=164–74 |year=2000 |month=July |pmid=10905786 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0701/p164.html}}</ref>

Several scoring systems are used to predict the severity of an attack of pancreatitis. They each combine demographic and laboratory data to estimate severity or probability of death. Examples include [[APACHE&nbsp;II]], [[Ranson criteria|Ranson]], and Glasgow. Apache&nbsp;II is available on admission; Glasgow and Ranson are simpler but cannot be determined for 48 hours. One form of the Glasgow criteria suggests that a case be considered severe if at least three of the following are true:<ref name="pmid2863441">{{cite journal |author=Corfield A. P., Cooper M. J., Williamson R. C., ''et al.'' |title=Prediction of severity in acute pancreatitis: prospective comparison of three prognostic indices |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8452 |pages=403–7 |year=1985 |pmid=2863441 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(85)92733-3}}</ref>

==Complications==
Early complications include [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], infection, [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]], low blood calcium, high blood glucose, and [[dehydration]]. Blood loss, dehydration, and [[third spacing|fluid leaking]] into the [[abdominal cavity]] ([[ascites]]) can lead to [[kidney failure]]. Respiratory complications are often [[acute respiratory distress syndrome|severe]]. [[Pleural effusion]] is usually present. Shallow breathing from pain can lead to [[atelectasis|lung collapse]]. Pancreatic enzymes may attack the lungs, causing [[pneumonitis|inflammation]]. Severe inflammation can lead to intra-abdominal hypertension and [[abdominal compartment syndrome]], further impairing renal and respiratory function and potentially requiring management with an open abdomen ([[laparostomy]]) to relieve the pressure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fitzgerald JE, Gupta S, Masterson S, Sigurdsson HH |title=Laparostomy management using the ABThera™ open abdomen negative pressure therapy system in a grade IV open abdomen secondary to acute pancreatitis |journal=Int Wound J |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2012 |month=April |pmid=22487377 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.00953.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.00953.x/abstract}}</ref>

Late complications include recurrent pancreatitis and the development of [[pancreatic pseudocyst]]s—collections of pancreatic secretions that have been walled off by scar tissue. These may cause pain, become infected, rupture and bleed, block the bile duct and cause [[jaundice]], or migrate around the abdomen. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis can lead to a [[pancreatic abscess]], a collection of [[pus]] caused by [[necrosis]], [[liquefaction]], and [[infection]]. This happens in approximately 3% of cases, or almost 60% of cases involving more than two pseudocysts and gas in the pancreas.<ref name="A">{{EMedicine|article|181264|Pancreatic abscess}}</ref>
