'''Epithelium''' is one of the four basic types of [[animal]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], along with [[connective tissue]], [[muscle tissue]] and [[nervous tissue]]. Epithelial tissues line the [[body cavities|cavities]] and surfaces of structures throughout the body, and also form many [[glands]]. Functions of epithelial cells include secretion, selective absorption, protection, [[transcellular transport]] and detection of sensation. In Greek "ἐπί" ("epi") means "on" or "upon", and "θηλή" ("thēlē") means "nipple".<ref>[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epithelium Epitheium at Wiktionary]</ref>
Epithelial layers are [[avascular]], so they must receive nourishment via diffusion of substances from the underlying connective tissue, through the [[basement membrane]].<ref name="Eurell-2006-p18">{{cite book|editors=Eurell, Jo Ann C. et al.|title=Dellmann's textbook of veterinary histology|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7817-4148-4|page=18|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FnS4uiOlRT0C&pyg=PA18}}</ref><ref name="p. 3">Freshney, 2002: [http://books.google.com/books?id=KqKNxeWlU6MC&pg=PA3 p. 3]</ref> Epithelia can also be organized into clusters of cells that function as exocrine and endocrine glands.

==Structure==
Cells in epithelium are very densely packed together like bricks in a wall, leaving very little intercellular space. The cells can form continuous sheets which are attached to each other at many locations by [[adherens junctions]], [[tight junctions]] and [[desmosomes]].<ref name="marieb-p103-104" />

===Basement membrane===
All epithelial cells rest on a [[basement membrane]], which acts as a [[scaffolding]] on which epithelium can grow and regenerate after injuries.<ref>{{Cite book|author=McConnell, Thomas H.|title=The nature of disease: pathology for the health professions|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7817-5317-3|page=55|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=chs_lilPFLwC&pg=PA55}}</ref> Epithelial tissue is [[innervated]], but [[avascular]]. This epithelial tissue must be nourished by substances diffusing from the blood vessels in the underlying tissue, but they don't have their own blood supply. The basement membrane acts as a selectively permeable membrane that determines which substances will be able to enter the epithelium.<ref name="Eurell-2006-p18"/><ref name="p. 3"/>

===Cell junctions===
[[Cell junctions]] are especially abundant in epithelial tissues. They consist of protein complexes and provide contact between neighbouring cells, between a cell and the extracellular matrix, or they build up the paracellular barrier of epithelia and control the [[paracellular transport]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Cell junctions are the contact points between plasma membrane and tissue cells. There are mainly 5 different types of cell junctions. They are tight junctions, adherens junctions, desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and gap junctions.
Tight junctions are a pair of trans-membranar protein fused on outer plasma membrane.
Adherens junctions are a plaque (protein layer on the inside plasma membrane) which attaches both cells' microfilaments.
Desmosomes attach to the microfilaments of cytoskeleton made up of keratin protein.
Hemidesmosomes resemble desmosomes on a section. They are made up of the integrin (a transmembraner protein) instead of cadherin. They attach the epithelial cell to the basement membrane.
Gap junctions connect the cytoplasm of two cells and are made up of proteins called connexins (six of which come together to make a connexon).

==Classification==
[[File:Illu epithelium.jpg|thumb|350px|Types of epithelium]]
Tissues are generally classified by the morphology of their cells, and the number of layers they are composed of.<ref name="Eurell-2006-p18" /><ref name="marieb-p103-104" /><ref>{{cite book|author=Platzer, Werner|title=Color atlas of human anatomy: Locomotor system|publisher=Thieme|year=2008|isbn=978-3-13-533306-9|page=8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=T9bb4T422j8C&pg=PA8}}</ref> Epithelial tissue that is only one cell thick is known as [[simple epithelium]].<ref>van Lommel, 2002: [http://books.google.com/books?id=EvYjLNKLu9sC&pg=PA94 p. 94]</ref> If it is two or more cells thick, it is known as [[stratified epithelium (disambiguation)|stratified epithelium]].<ref name="vanLommel-2002-p97">van Lommel, 2002: [http://books.google.com/books?id=EvYjLNKLu9sC&pg=PA97 p. 97]</ref> However, when taller simple epithelial cells (see [[#Simple columnar epithelium|columnar]], below) are viewed in cross section with several nuclei appearing at different heights, they can be confused with stratified epithelia. This kind of epithelium is therefore described as [[pseudostratified epithelium|"pseudostratified"]] epithelium.<ref>{{cite book|editors=Melfi, Rudy C. & Alley, Keith E.|title=Permar's oral embryology and microscopic anatomy: a textbook for students in dental hygiene|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2000|isbn=978-0-683-30644-6|page=9|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fGonan0UwhQC&pg=PA9}}</ref>

There are three principal morphologies associated with epithelial cells. [[Squamous epithelium]] has cells which are wider than they are tall (flat and scale-like). [[Cuboidal epithelium]] has cells whose height and width are approximately the same (cube shaped). [[Columnar epithelium]] has cells taller than they are wide (column shaped). In addition, the morphology of the cells in [[transitional epithelium]] may vary from squamous to cuboidal, depending on the amount of tension on the epithelium.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pratt|first=Rebecca|title=Epithelial Cells|url=http://www.anatomyone.com/a/epithelial-cells/|work=AnatomyOne|publisher=Amirsys, Inc|accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref>

===Simple epithelium===
Simple epithelium is one cell thick, that is, every cell is in direct contact with the underlying [[basement membrane]]. It is generally found where absorption and filtration occur. The thinness of the epithelial barrier facilitates these processes.<ref name="marieb-p103-104" />

Simple epithelial tissues are generally classified by the shape of their cells. The four major classes of simple epithelium are: (1) simple squamous; (2) simple cuboidal; (3) simple columnar; (4) pseudostratified.<ref name="marieb-p103-104">{{cite book|author=Marieb, Elaine M.|title=Human Anatomy and Physiology|edition=3rd|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|year=1995|isbn=0-8053-4281-8|pages=103–104}}</ref>

Simple squamous epithelium is found lining areas where passive diffusion of gases occur, including the walls of [[capillary|capillaries]], the linings of the [[alveolus|alveoli]] of the lungs, and the linings of the [[pericardial cavity|pericardial]], [[pleural cavity|pleural]], and [[peritoneal cavity|peritoneal]] cavities.

==Functions==
The primary functions of epithelial tissues are: (1) to protect the tissues that lie beneath it from [[radiation]], desiccation, [[toxins]], invasion by pathogens, and physical [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]]; (2) the regulation and exchange of chemicals between the underlying tissues and a [[body cavity]]; (3) the secretion of hormones into the blood vascular system, and/or the secretion of sweat, mucus, enzymes, and other products that are delivered by ducts [[glandular epithelium]];<ref>van Lommel, 2002: [http://books.google.com/books?id=EvYjLNKLu9sC&pg=PA91 p. 91]</ref> (4) to provide [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26868/ sensation].

===Secretory epithelia===
As stated above, secretion is one major function of epithelial cells. [[Glands]] are formed from the invagination / infolding of epithelial cells and subsequent growth in the underlying connective tissue. There are two major classifications of glands: [[endocrine glands]] and [[exocrine glands]]. Endocrine glands secrete their product into the extracellular space where it is rapidly taken up by the blood vascular system. The exocrine glands secrete their products into a duct that then delivers the product to the lumen of an organ or onto the free surface of the epithelium.

In arthropods, the [[integument]], or external "skin", consists of a single layer of [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[ectoderm]] from which arises the [[cuticle]],<ref name="Kristensen&Georges2003">{{cite book|last1=Kristensen|first1=Niels P.|last2=Georges|first2=Chauvin|title=Lepidoptera, Moths and Butterflies: Morphology, Physiology, and Development : Teilband|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5w8FgSGuH34C&pg=PA484|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=1 December 2003|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-016210-3|page=484|chapter=Integument}}</ref> an outer covering of [[chitin]] the rigidity of which varies as per its chemical composition.

===Sensing the extracellular environment===
"Some epithelial cells are [[cilium|cilia]]ted, and they commonly exist as a sheet of polarised cells forming a tube or tubule with cilia projecting into the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]." [[Cilium|Primary cilia]] on epithelial cells provide chemosensation, thermosensation and [[mechanosensation]] of the extracellular environment by playing "a sensory role mediating specific signalling cues, including soluble factors in the external cell environment, a [[Secretion|secretory]] role in which a soluble protein is released to have an effect downstream of the fluid flow, and mediation of fluid flow if the cilia are [[Motility|motile]]."<ref name="Adams2008">{{cite journal|author=Adams, M.; Smith, U.M.; Logan, C.V.; Johnson, C.A.|title=Recent advances in the molecular pathology, cell biology and genetics of [[ciliopathy|ciliopathies]]|journal=Journal of Medical Genetics|volume=45|pages=257–267|year=2008|url=http://jmg.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/45/5/257|doi=10.1136/jmg|pmid=18178628|issue=5}}</ref>

==Embryological development==
In general, there are epithelial tissues deriving from all of the embryological [[germ layers]]{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}:

* from [[ectoderm]] (e.g., the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]);
* from [[endoderm]] (e.g., the lining of the [[human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]]);
* from [[mesoderm]] (e.g., the inner linings of [[body cavities]]).

However, it is important to note that [[pathologists]] do not consider [[endothelium]] and [[mesothelium]] (both derived from mesoderm) to be true epithelium. This is because such tissues present very different pathology. For that reason, pathologists label cancers in endothelium and mesothelium [[sarcoma]]s, whereas true epithelial cancers are called [[carcinoma]]s. Also, the filaments that support these mesoderm-derived tissues are very distinct. Outside of the field of pathology, it is, in general, accepted that the epithelium arises from all three germ layers.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Growing in culture==
When growing epithelium in culture, one can determine whether or not a particular cell is epithelial by examining its morphological characteristics. Epithelial cells tend to cluster together, and have a "characteristic tight pavementlike appearance". But this is not always the case, such as when the cells are derived from a tumor. In these cases, it is often necessary to use certain biochemical markers to make a positive identification. The intermediate filament proteins in the [[cytokeratin]] group are almost exclusively found in epithelial cells, and so are often used for this purpose.<ref>Freshney, 2002: [http://books.google.com/books?id=KqKNxeWlU6MC&pg=PA9 p. 9]</ref>

==Location==
Epithelium lines both the outside ([[skin]]) and the inside cavities and [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of bodies. The outermost layer of our [[skin]] is composed of dead [[Squamous epithelium|stratified squamous]], [[epidermis (skin)|keratinized]] epithelial cells.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Tissues that line the inside of the mouth, the esophagus and part of the rectum are composed of [[epidermis (skin)|nonkeratinized]] stratified squamous epithelium. Other surfaces that separate body cavities from the outside environment are lined by simple squamous, columnar, or pseudostratified epithelial cells. Other epithelial cells line the insides of the [[lung]]s, the [[human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]], the reproductive and urinary tracts, and make up the [[exocrine gland|exocrine]] and [[endocrine system|endocrine]] glands. The outer surface of the [[cornea]] is covered with fast-growing, easily regenerated epithelial cells. [[Endothelium]] (the inner lining of [[blood vessel]]s, the [[heart]], and [[lymphatic system|lymphatic vessels]]) is a specialized form of epithelium. Another type, [[mesothelium]], forms the walls of the [[pericardium]], [[pleural cavity|pleurae]], and [[peritoneum]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
