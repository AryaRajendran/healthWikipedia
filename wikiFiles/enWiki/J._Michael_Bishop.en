'''John Michael Bishop''' (born February 22, 1936) is an [[United States|American]] [[immunologist]] and [[microbiologist]] who shared the 1989 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Harold E. Varmus]] and was co-winner of 1984 [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]].<ref>http://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=8172</ref> He currently serves as an active faculty member at the [[University of California, San Francisco]].<ref name="nms"/><ref name="nobio"/>

== Life ==
Bishop was born in [[Pennsylvania]].  He attended [[Gettysburg College]] as an undergraduate, where he was a brother of the Theta-Pi Zeta chapter of [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] International Fraternity. He later attended [[Harvard University]] where he earned an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in 1962.

He began his career working for the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]], a part of the [[National Institutes of Health]].  He then spent a year working for the [[Heinrich Pette Institute]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] before joining the faculty of the [[University of California, San Francisco]] in 1968.<ref name="ucsf"/> Bishop has remained on the school's faculty since 1968, and was chancellor of the university from 1998-2009.<ref name="stepdown"/> He is Director of the Bishop Lab.<ref>http://hooper.ucsf.edu/hooper/bishop_lab.html</ref>

Bishop is best known for his Nobel-winning work on [[retrovirus|retroviral]] [[oncogenes]].  Working with [[Harold E. Varmus]] in the 1980s, he discovered the first human oncogene, [[Src (gene)#c-src|c-Src]].  Their findings allowed the understanding of how malignant [[tumor]]s are formed from changes to the normal [[gene]]s of a [[Cell (biology)|cell]].  These changes can be produced by viruses, by radiation, or by exposure to some chemicals.<ref name="nopress"/>

Bishop is also a recipient of [[National Medal of Science]] in 2003.<ref name="nms"/> That same year, his book  "How to win the Nobel Prize: An Unexpected Life in Science" was published. He was elected [[List_of_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society_A,B,C#B_2|Foreign Member of the Royal Society]] on 16 May 2008.
