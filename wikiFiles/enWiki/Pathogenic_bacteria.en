Pathogenic bacteria are [[bacteria]] that cause '''bacterial [[infectious disease|infection]]'''. This article deals with human pathogenic bacteria.

Although the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial, quite a few bacteria are [[pathogenic]]. One of the bacterial diseases with highest [[disease burden]] is [[tuberculosis]], caused by the bacterium ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', which kills about 2 million people a year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases, such as [[pneumonia]], which can be caused by bacteria such as ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', and foodborne illnesses, which can be caused by bacteria such as ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'', and ''[[Salmonella]]''. Pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as [[tetanus]], [[typhoid fever]], [[diphtheria]], [[syphilis]], and [[leprosy]].

[[Koch's postulates]] are criteria designed to establish a causal relationship between a causative microbe and a disease.

==Diseases==
Each pathogenic species has a characteristic [[spectrum]] of interactions with its human [[host (biology)|hosts]].

===Conditionally pathogenic===
Conditionally pathogenic bacteria are only pathogenic under certain conditions, such as a wound that allows for entry into the blood, or a decrease in immune function.

For example, ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' or ''[[Streptococcus]]'' are also part of the normal [[human flora]] and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing disease, but can potentially cause skin infections, [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]], and even overwhelming [[sepsis]], a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fish DN |title=Optimal antimicrobial therapy for sepsis |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=59 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S13–9 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11885408 |url=http://www.ajhp.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11885408}}</ref>

Some species of bacteria, such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Burkholderia cenocepacia]]'', and ''[[Mycobacterium avium complex|Mycobacterium avium]]'', are [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogens]] and cause disease mainly in people suffering from [[immunosuppression]] or [[cystic fibrosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Heise E | title = Diseases associated with immunosuppression | pmc=1568899 | journal = Environ Health Perspect | volume = 43 | issue = |pages=9–19 |year=1982 |pmid=7037390 |doi=10.2307/3429162 | jstor=3429162}}</ref><ref name=Saiman>{{cite journal |author=Saiman L |title=Microbiology of early CF lung disease |journal=Paediatr Respir Rev |volume=5 |issue=Suppl A |pages=S367–9 |year=2004 |pmid=14980298 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1526054204900656 |doi=10.1016/S1526-0542(04)90065-6}}</ref>

===Intracellular===
Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as [[obligate intracellular parasite]]s (e.g. [[Chlamydophila]], [[Ehrlichia]], [[Rickettsia]]) that are able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. Still, infections with intracellular bacteria may be [[asymptomatic]], such as during the [[incubation period]]. An example of intracellular bacteria is ''[[Rickettsia]]''. One species of ''Rickettsia'' causes [[typhus]], while another causes [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].

[[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]], another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause [[pneumonia]] or [[urinary tract infection]] and may be involved in [[coronary heart disease]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Belland R, Ouellette S, Gieffers J, Byrne G | title = Chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerosis | journal = Cell Microbiol | volume = 6 |issue=2 |pages=117–27 |year=2004 |pmid=14706098 |doi=10.1046/j.1462-5822.2003.00352.x}}</ref>

''[[Mycobacterium]]'', ''[[Brucella]]'', ''[[Francisella]]'', ''[[Legionella]]'', and ''[[Listeria]]'' can exist intracellularly, though they are facultative (not obligate) intracellular parasites.

===By location===
Following is a list of bacterial infections classified by location in the body:
*[[Bacterial vaginosis]] is a disease of the vagina caused by an imbalance of naturally occurring bacterial flora and is often confused with [[yeast infection]] ([[candidiasis]]), or infection with ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]'' ([[trichomoniasis]]), which are not caused by [[bacteria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://women.webmd.com/features/is-it-yeast-infection |author=Terri Warren, RN |title=Is It a Yeast Infection? |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01759-8 |author=Ferris DG, Nyirjesy P, Sobel JD, Soper D, Pavletic A, Litaker MS |year=2002 |month=March |title=Over-the-counter antifungal drug misuse associated with patient-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=419–425 |pmid=11864668 }}</ref>
*[[Bacterial meningitis]] is a bacterial [[inflammation]] of the [[meninges]], that is, the protective membranes covering the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].
*[[Bacterial pneumonia]] is a bacterial infection of the [[lung]]s.
*[[Urinary tract infection]] is almost exclusively caused by bacteria. Symptoms include frequent feeling and/or need to urinate, pain during [[urination]], and cloudy urine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/urine_infection/page4.htm|title=Urinary Tract Infections|accessdate=2010-02-04 }}</ref> The main causal agent is ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Although [[urine]] contains a variety of fluids, salts, and waste products, it does not usually have bacteria in it,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_asybac_crs.htm|title=Adult Health Advisor 2005.4: Bacteria in Urine, No Symptoms (Asymptomatic Bacteriuria)|accessdate=2007-08-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070712060000/http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_asybac_crs.htm|archivedate=2007-07-12}}</ref> but when bacteria get into the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] or [[kidney]] and multiply in the urine, they may cause a UTI.
*[[Bacterial gastroenteritis]] is caused by pathogenic enteric bacteria. Such pathogenic enteric bacteria are generally distinguished from the usually harmless bacteria of the normal [[gut flora]], but the distinction is often not fully clear, and ''[[Escherichia]]'', for example, can belong to either group.
*Bacterial [[skin infection]]s include:
** [[Impetigo]] is a highly contagious [[bacteria]]l [[human skin|skin]] [[infection]] most common among pre-school children.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Impetigo/Pages/Introduction.aspx NHS Impetigo]</ref> It is primarily caused by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and sometimes by ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''.<ref name=Robbins>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; & Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 843 ISBN 978-1-4160-2973-1</ref>
** [[Erysipelas]] is an acute [[streptococcus]] [[bacteria]]l infection<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000036667|erysipelas}}</ref> of the deep epidermis with lymphatic spread.
** [[Cellulitis]] is a diffuse [[inflammation]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|two/000019077|cellulitis}}</ref> of [[connective tissue]] with severe inflammation of dermal and subcutaneous layers of the [[skin]]. Cellulitis can be caused by normal [[skin flora]] or by [[exogenous bacteria]], and often occurs where the skin has previously been broken: cracks in the skin, cuts, [[blister]]s, [[burn (injury)|burns]], [[insect bite]]s, [[surgical wound]]s, intravenous [[drug injection]], or sites of [[intravenous]] [[catheter]] insertion. Skin on the face or lower legs is most commonly affected by this infection, though cellulitis can occur on any part of the body.

==Treatment==
{{main|Antibiotics}}
:''See also [[Pathogenic bacteria#Clinical characteristics|overview list]] below''

Bacterial infections may be treated with [[antibiotic]]s, which are classified as [[bacteriocide|bacteriocidal]] if they kill bacteria or [[bacteriostatic]] if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. For example, the antibiotics [[chloramphenicol]] and [[tetracyclin]] inhibit the bacterial [[ribosome]] but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome, so they exhibit selective toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yonath A, Bashan A | title = Ribosomal crystallography: initiation, peptide bond formation, and amino acid polymerization are hampered by antibiotics |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol |volume=58 |pages=233–51 |year=2004 |pmid=15487937 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123822}}</ref> Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in [[intensive farming]] to promote animal growth. Both uses may be contributing to the rapid development of [[antibiotic resistance]] in bacterial populations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Khachatourians GG |title=Agricultural use of antibiotics and the evolution and transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria |journal=CMAJ |volume=159 |issue=9 |pages=1129–36 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9835883 |pmc=1229782 |doi= |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&pmid=9835883}}</ref> [[Phage therapy]] can also be used to treat certain bacterial infections.<ref>{{cite doi|10.3389/fmicb.2012.00238}}</ref> Infections can be prevented by [[antiseptic]] measures such as sterilizing the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] to prevent infection by bacteria. [[Disinfectants]] such as [[bleach]] are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection. Bacteria in food are killed by cooking to temperatures above 73 °C (163°F).
