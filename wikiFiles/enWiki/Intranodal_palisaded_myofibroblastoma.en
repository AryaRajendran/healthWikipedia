'''Intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma''', abbreviated '''IPM''', is a rare primary tumour of [[lymph node]]s, that classically presents as an [[Groin|inguinal]] mass.<ref name=pmid17284119>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nguyen | first1 = T. | last2 = Eltorky | first2 = MA. | title = Intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma. | journal = Arch Pathol Lab Med | volume = 131 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–10 | month = Feb | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1043/1543-2165(2007)131[306:IPM]2.0.CO;2 | PMID = 17284119 }}</ref>

It afflicts predominantly males of middle age.

==Signs and symptoms==
IPMs present as painless [[lymphadenopathy]].<ref name=pmid17284119/> They usually are found in the inguinal region and grow slowly.  

The signs and symptoms are non-specific, i.e. it is not possible to diagnose an IPM from the symptoms and manner in which they present.  

The main (clinical) differential diagnosis of IPM is [[metastasis|metastatic]] [[cancer]], e.g. [[squamous cell carcinoma]], [[malignant melanoma]], [[adenocarcinoma]].

==Diagnosis==
IPMs are diagnosed by examination of the [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] by a [[pathologist]].  

They have a rim of peripheral [[lymphoid tissue]] (remnant of a [[lymph node]]) and consist of [[spindle cell]]s with [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[palisade|palisading]]. [[Red blood cell]] [[extravasation]] is common and [[blood vessel]]s surrounded by [[collagen]] with (fine) peripheral [[spoke]]s (amianthoid fibers) are usually seen.<ref name=pmid1918406>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bigotti | first1 = G. | last2 = Coli | first2 = A. | last3 = Mottolese | first3 = M. | last4 = Di Filippo | first4 = F. | title = Selective location of palisaded myofibroblastoma with amianthoid fibres. | journal = J Clin Pathol | volume = 44 | issue = 9 | pages = 761–4 | month = Sep | year = 1991 | doi =  | PMID = 1918406 }}</ref>

[[Immunostain]]s for [[smooth muscle]] [[actin]] and [[cyclin D1]] are characteristically positive. The main [[histologic]] [[differential diagnosis]] is [[schwannoma]].

==Treatment==
Simple surgical excision is considered curative. Rare recurrences have been reported.<ref name=pmid10235504>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Creager | first1 = AJ. | last2 = Garwacki | first2 = CP. | title = Recurrent intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma with metaplastic bone formation. | journal = Arch Pathol Lab Med | volume = 123 | issue = 5 | pages = 433–6 | month = May | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1043/0003-9985(1999)1230433:RIPMWM2.0.CO;2 | PMID = 10235504 }}</ref>
