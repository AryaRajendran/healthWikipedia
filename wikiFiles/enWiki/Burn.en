A '''burn''' is a type of [[injury]] to [[flesh]] or [[skin]] caused by [[heat]], [[electricity]], [[chemicals]], [[friction]], or [[radiation]].<ref name=TBCChp4/> Most burns affect only the superficial skin (known as superficial or first degree) or extend into the deeper skin but do not involve the full thickness of the skin (known as partial thickness or second degree). Rarely all layers of the skin or deeper tissues, such as [[muscle]] or [[bone]] can be injured in which case the burn is either full thickness (third degree) or fourth degree. 

<!--Management  -->
The treatment required depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns maybe managed with little more than simple pain killers while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized [[burn center]]s. Cooling with tap water may aid pain and decrease damage however if exposure is prolonged it may result in [[hypothermia|low body temperature]]. Partial thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water followed by dressings. Blisters should typically be left unbroken. Full thickness burns usually require surgical treatments such as [[skin graft]]ing and extensive burns often require large amount of [[intravenous fluids]]. The most common complications of burns are related to [[infection]].

<!-- Epidemiology -->
While large burns can be fatal, modern treatments developed in the last 50 years have significantly improved the outcomes, especially in children and young adults.<ref name=TBCChp1/> Globally about 11&nbsp;million people seek medical treatment and 300,000 people die from burns.<ref name=Epi2011/> In the United States, of those admitted to a [[burn center]], approximately 4% die from their injuries.<ref name=ABA2012/> The long term outcome is primarily related to the size of burn and the age of the person effected.

==Signs and symptoms==
The characteristics of a burn depend upon its depth. Burns around the mouth or singed hair inside the nose may indicate that burns to the airways have occurred but these findings are not definitive.<ref name=Schw2010/> More worrisome signs include: [[shortness of breath]], hoarseness, [[stridor]] or [[wheezing]].<ref name=Schw2010/> [[Pruritus|Itchiness]] is common during the healing process, being present in as much as 90% of adults and nearly all children.<ref name=Itchy2009>{{cite journal|last=Goutos|first=I|coauthors=Dziewulski, P; Richardson, PM|title=Pruritus in burns: review article.|journal=Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association|date=2009 Mar-Apr|volume=30|issue=2|pages=221–8|pmid=19165110}}</ref> Numbness or tingling may persist for a prolong period of time after an electrical injury.<ref name=RosenChp140/> Burns may also produce emotional and psychological distress.<ref name=Epi2011/>

==Cause==
Burns are caused by a variety of external sources classified into thermal, chemical, electrical, and radiation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kowalski|first=Caroline Bunker Rosdahl, Mary T.|title=Textbook of basic nursing|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-6521-3|page=1109|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=odY9mXicPlYC&pg=PA1109|edition=9th}}</ref> In the United States the most common cause of burns are fire/flame (44%), scalds (33%), hot objects (9%), electricity (4%), and chemicals (3%).<ref name=ABA2012pgi>National Burn Repository Pg. i</ref> Most (69%) of burn injuries occur at home or at work (9%).<ref name=ABA2012>{{cite web|title=Burn Incidence and Treatment in the United States: 2012 Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ameriburn.org/resources_factsheet.php|work=American Burn Association|accessdate=20 April 2013|year=2012}}</ref> Most burns are accidental, with 2% due to assault by another and 1-2% representing a [[suicide]] attempt.<ref name=Epi2011/> These sources can cause inhalational injury to the airway and/or lungs which occur in about 6%.<ref name=TBCChp3/>

===Thermal===
In the United States fire and hot liquids are the most common cause of burns.<ref name=TBCChp3/> Of house fires that result in death, smoking was the cause of 25%, and heating devices were the cause of 22%.<ref name=TBCChp4/> Almost half of injuries are due to efforts to fight a fire.<ref name=TBCChp4/> [[Scalding]] is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks, high temperature [[tap water]] in baths or showers, hot cooking oil or steam.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gardiner|first=edited by Mark|title=Training in paediatrics : the essential curriculum|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-922773-0|page=36|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=FLBMvTff9sMC&pg=PA36|coauthors=Eisen, Sarah; Murphy, Catherine}}</ref> Scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five<ref name=Tint2010/> and, in the United States and Australia, this population makes up about two-thirds of all burns.<ref name=TBCChp3/> Contact with hot objects is the cause of about 20-30% of burns in children.<ref name=TBCChp3/> Generally, scalds are first or second degree burns, but third degree burns can result, especially with prolonged contact.<ref name=Mag2008/> [[Fireworks]] are a common cause of burns during holiday seasons in many countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peden|first=Margie|title=World report on child injury prevention|year=2008|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva, Switzerland|isbn=978-92-4-156357-4|page=86|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=UeXwoNh8sbwC&pg=PA86}}</ref>

<!--No accidental burns  -->

===Chemical===
{{Main|Chemical burn}}
Chemicals cause from 2 to 11% of all burns and contribute to as many as 30% of burn-related deaths.<ref name=Hard2012>{{cite journal|last=Hardwicke|first=J|coauthors=Hunter, T; Staruch, R; Moiemen, N|title=Chemical burns--an historical comparison and review of the literature.|journal=Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries|date=2012 May|volume=38|issue=3|pages=383–7|pmid=22037150}}</ref> Chemical burns can be caused by over twenty-five thousand substances,<ref name=Tint2010/> most of which are either a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] (55%) or a strong [[acid]] (26%).<ref name=Hard2012/> Most chemical-burn deaths are  secondary to [[ingestion]].<ref name=Tint2010/> Common agents include: [[sulfuric acid]] as found in toilet cleaners, [[sodium hypochlorite]] as found in bleach, and [[halogenated hydrocarbons]] as found in paint remover, among others.<ref name=Tint2010/> [[Hydrofluoric acid]] can cause particularly deep burns which sometimes do not become symptomatic until some time after exposure.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Makarovsky|first=I|coauthors=Markel, G; Dushnitsky, T; Eisenkraft, A|title=Hydrogen fluoride--the protoplasmic poison.|journal=The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ|date=2008 May|volume=10|issue=5|pages=381–5|pmid=18605366}}</ref> [[Formic acid]] may cause the break down of significant numbers of [[red blood cell]]s.<ref name=Schw2010/>

===Electrical===
{{main|Electrical burn}}
Electrical burns or injuries are classified as high voltage (greater than or equal to 1000&nbsp;[[volts]]), low voltage (less than 1000&nbsp;[[volts]]), or as [[flash burn]]s secondary to an [[electric arc]].<ref name=Tint2010/> The most common cause of electrical burns in children are electrical cords (60%) followed by electrical outlets (14%).<ref name=TBCChp3/> [[Lightning]] may also result in electrical burns.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edlich|first=RF|coauthors=Farinholt, HM; Winters, KL; Britt, LD; Long WB, 3rd|title=Modern concepts of treatment and prevention of lightning injuries.|journal=Journal of long-term effects of medical implants|year=2005|volume=15|issue=2|pages=185–96|pmid=15777170}}</ref> Risk factors for being struck include involvement in outdoor activities such as mountain climbing, golf and field sports as well as working outside.<ref name=RosenChp140/> Mortality from a lightning strike is about 10%.<ref name=RosenChp140/>

While electrical injuries primarily result in burns they may also cause [[fractures]] or [[dislocations]] secondary to [[blunt force trauma]] or [[muscle contraction]]s.<ref name=RosenChp140/> In high voltage injuries, most damage may occur internally and thus the extent of the injury cannot be judged by examination of the skin alone.<ref name=RosenChp140/> Contact with either low voltage or high voltage may produce [[cardiac arrhythmias]] or [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=RosenChp140/>

===Radiation===
{{Main|Radiation burn}}
[[Radiation burns]] may be caused by protracted exposure to [[ultraviolet light]] (such as from the sun, [[tanning booths]] or [[arc welding]]) or from [[ionizing radiation]] (such as from [[radiation therapy]], [[X-rays]] or [[radioactive fallout]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Prahlow|first=Joseph|title=Forensic pathology for police, death investigators, and forensic scientists|year=2010|publisher=Humana|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=978-1-59745-404-9|page=485|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=rF1WTiX0nHEC&pg=PA485}}</ref> Sun exposure is the most common cause of radiation burns and the most common cause of superficial burns overall.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kearns RD, Cairns CB, Holmes JH, Rich PB, Cairns BA |title=Thermal burn care: a review of best practices.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Burn Degree Diagram.svg|thumb|Three degrees of burns]]
At temperatures greater than {{convert|44|C|F}}, proteins begin losing their three-dimensional shape and start breaking down.<ref name=Rosen2009/> This results in cell and tissue damage.<ref name=Tint2010/> 
Many of the direct health effects of a burn are secondary to disruption in the normal functioning of the skin.<ref name=Tint2010/> The includes disruption of the skin's ability to: prevention water loss through evaporation, maintain temperature control, and sensation.<ref name=Tint2010/> Disruption of cell membranes causes cells to lose potassium to the spaces outside the cell and to take up water and sodium.<ref name=Tint2010/> 

In large burns (>30% TBSA) there is a significant inflammatory response.<ref name=Roj2012>{{cite journal |author=Rojas Y, Finnerty CC, Radhakrishnan RS, Herndon DN |title=Burns: an update on current pharmacotherapy |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=13 |issue=17 |pages=2485–94 |year=2012 |month=December |pmid=23121414 |pmc=3576016 |doi=10.1517/14656566.2012.738195 |url=}}</ref> This results in increased leakage of fluid from [[capillaries]]<ref name=Schw2010/> and subsequent tissue [[edema]].<ref name=Tint2010/> There is significant [[plasma]] loss with the blood becomes concentrated and less in volume.<ref name=Tint2010/> Poor blood flow to [[organs]] such as the kidneys and [[gastrointestinal tract]] may result in [[renal failure]] and [[gastric ulcers|stomach ulcers]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hannon|first=Ruth|title=Porth pathophysiology : concepts of altered health states|year=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-60547-781-7|page=1516|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=2-MFXOEG0lcC&pg=PA1516|edition=1st Canadian}}</ref>

Increased levels of [[catecholamines]] and [[cortisol]] may result in a [[hypermetabolism|hypermetabolic state]] which may last for years.<ref name=Roj2012/> This is associated with increased [[cardiac output]], [[metabolism]], [[tachycardia|a fast heart rate]], and poor [[immune suppression|immune function]].<ref name=Roj2012/>

==Diagnosis==
Burns can be classified by depth, mechanism of injury, extent, and associated injuries. The most commonly used classification is based on the depth of injury. The depth of a burn is usually determined via examination, although a biopsy may also be used.<ref name=Tint2010/> It may be difficult to accurately determine the depth of a burn on a single examination and repeated examination over a few days may be necessary.<ref name=Schw2010/> In those who have a [[headache]] or are dizzy and have a fire related burn [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] should be considered.<ref name=CEM2012/> [[Cyanide poisoning]] should also be considered.<ref name=Schw2010>{{cite book|last=Brunicardi|first=Charles|title=Schwartz's principles of surgery|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub. Division|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-154769-7|edition=9th|chapter=8}}</ref>

===Size===
The size of a burn is measured as a percentage of [[total body surface area]] (TBSA) affected by partial thickness or full thickness burns.<ref name=Tint2010/> First degree burns (red only, no blisters) are not included in this estimation.<ref name=Tint2010/> Most burns (70%) involve less than 10% of the TBSA.<ref name=TBCChp3/>

There are a number of methods to determine the TBSA including: the rule of nines, Lund and Browder charts, and estimations based on a person's palm size.<ref name=EMP2009/> The rule of nines is easy to remember but only accurate in people over 16&nbsp;years of age.<ref name=EMP2009/> More accurate estimation can be made using Lund and Browder charts, which take into account the different proportions of body parts in adults and children.<ref name=EMP2009/>
The size of a person's hand print (palm and fingers) is approximately 1% of their TBSA.<ref name=EMP2009/>

In order to determine the need for referral to a specialized burn unit, the American Burn Association devised a classification system. Under this system, burns can be classified as major, moderate and minor. This is assessed based on a number of factors, including total body surface area burnt, the involvement of specific anatomical zones, age of the person and associated injuries.<ref name=CEM2012/> Minor burns can typically be managed at home, moderate burns are often managed in hospital and major burns are managed by a burn center.<ref name=CEM2012>{{cite book|last=Garmel|first=edited by S.V.

==Management==
Resuscitation begins with the assessment and stabilization of the person's airway, breathing and circulation.<ref name=EMP2009/> If inhalation injury is suspected, early [[intubation]] maybe required.<ref name=Schw2010/> This is followed by care of the burn wound itself.

=== Wound care ===
Early cooling, within 30 minutes of the burn, reduces burn depth and pain, but care must be taken as cooling can result in hypothermia.<ref name=Tint2010>{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli)) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=1374–1386|isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=EMP2009/> This should be done with cool water {{convert|10|–|25|C|F|1}} and not ice water as the latter can cause further injury.<ref name=EMP2009/><ref name=Rosen2009/> Chemical burns may require extensive irrigation.<ref name=Tint2010/> Cleaning with soap and water, [[debridement|removal of death tissue]], and dressings are important aspects of wound care.<!-- <ref name=Rosen2009/> --> If intact blisters are present it is not clear what should be done with them.<!-- <ref name=Rosen2009/> --> Some tentative evidence supports leaving them intact.<!-- <ref name=Rosen2009/> --> Second degree burns should be re-evaluated after two days.<ref name=Rosen2009/>

===Medications===
Burns can be very painful and a number of different options maybe used for [[pain management]].<!-- <ref name=Rosen2009/> -->  These include simple analgesics (such as [[ibuprofen]] and [[acetaminophen]]) and [[opioids]] such as morphine.<!-- <ref name=Rosen2009/> --> [[Benzodiazepines]] maybe used in addition to analgesics to help with anxiety.<ref name=Rosen2009/> During the healing process [[antihistamines]], [[message]], or [[transcutaneous nerve stimulation]] may be used to aid with itching.<ref name=Itchy2009/> Antihistamines however are only effective in 20% of people.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zachariah|first=JR|coauthors=Rao, AL; Prabha, R; Gupta, AK; Paul, MK; Lamba, S|title=Post burn pruritus--a review of current treatment options.|journal=Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries|date=2012 Aug|volume=38|issue=5|pages=621–9|pmid=22244605}}</ref> Tentative evidence supports the use of [[gabapentin]].<ref name=Itchy2009/>

Intravenous [[antibiotic]]s may improve survival in those with large and severe burns.<ref name=Anti2010/> There is however concerns that it increases the risk of [[Mycosis|fungal infections]] and [[antibiotic resistance]].<ref name=Schw2010/> Due to the poor quality of the evidence, routine use is not recommended other than possibly just before surgery.<ref name=Anti2010>{{cite journal |author=Avni T, Levcovich A, Ad-El DD, Leibovici L, Paul M |title=Prophylactic antibiotics for burns patients: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=340 |issue= |pages=c241 |year=2010 |pmid=20156911 |pmc=2822136 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c241|url=}}</ref> [[Erythropoietin]] has not been found to be effective to prevent or treat anemia in people with burns.<ref name=Schw2010/>

===Surgery===
Wounds requiring surgical closure with skin grafts or flaps (typically anything more than a small full thickness burn) should be dealt with as early as possible.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jeschke|first=Marc|title=Handbook of Burns Volume 1: Acute Burn Care|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-7091-0348-7|page=266|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=olshnFqCI0kC&pg=PA266}}</ref> Circumferential burns of the limbs or chest may need urgent surgical release of the skin, known as an [[escharotomy]].<ref name=Surgery2009/> This is done to treat or prevent problems with distal circulation, or ventilation.<ref name=Surgery2009>{{cite journal|last=Orgill|first=DP|coauthors=Piccolo, N|title=Escharotomy and decompressive therapies in burns.|journal=Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association|date=2009 Sep-Oct|volume=30|issue=5|pages=759–68|pmid=19692906}}</ref> It is uncertain if it is useful for neck or digit burns.<ref name=Surgery2009/> [[Fasciotomy|Fasciotomies]] may be required for electrical burns.<ref name=Surgery2009/>

===Alternative medicine===
Honey has been used since ancient times to aid wound healing and may be beneficial in first and second degree burns.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jull AB, Rodgers A, Walker N |title=Honey as a topical treatment for wounds |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD005083 |year=2008 |pmid=18843679 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005083.pub2 |url= |editor1-first=Andrew B |editor1-last=Jull}}</ref> There is little evidence that [[vitamin E]] helps with keloids or scarring.<ref name=Juck2009/> In low income countries burns are treated up to a third of the time with [[traditional medicine]] which may include applications of eggs, mud, leaves or cow dung.<ref name=LMIC2006>{{cite journal|last=Forjuoh|first=SN|title=Burns in low- and middle-income countries: a review of available literature on descriptive epidemiology, risk factors, treatment, and prevention.|journal=Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries|date=2006 Aug|volume=32|issue=5|pages=529–37|pmid=16777340}}</ref> Surgical management is limited in some cases due to insufficient financial resources and availability.<ref name=LMIC2006/>

There are a number of methods to reduce procedural pain and anxiety for children with burns include the use of virtual reality therapy, relaxation techniques, sensory focusing, distraction, and education.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ric G.
