The '''Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI)''' is a comprehensive [[cancer]] research and treatment center located in [[Buffalo, New York]]. Founded in 1898 by [[Dr. Roswell Park]], it was the first dedicated medical facility for cancer treatment and research in the [[United States]]. The facility is involved in [[drug]] development and conducts clinical research for cancer treatment.  Roswell Park Cancer Institute is the only [[upstate New York]] facility to hold the [[National Cancer Institute]] designation of "comprehensive cancer center" and to serve as a member of the [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]].

The campus spans {{convert|27|acre|m2}} in downtown Buffalo and includes {{convert|1500000|sqft|m2}} of space equally distributed between [[clinic]]al programs and research/education functions. A hospital building, completed in 1998, houses a comprehensive diagnostic and treatment center. The campus includes a medical research complex and renovated existing education and research space.

Education Annually:
* 250 clinical residents/oncology fellows
* 100 postdoctoral research fellows
* 196 predoctoral graduate students
* 75 summer research students in high school and college, medical and dental schools
* 40 exchange visitors - international research scholars

==History==
[[File:Gerty Theresa Radnitz Cori (1896-1957) and Carl Ferdinand Cori.jpg|thumb|[[Gerty Cori]] and [[Carl Cori]] jointly won the 1947 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their discovery of the [[Cori cycle]] at RPMI.]]
Roswell Park Cancer institute was established in 1898 by Dr. Roswell Park, who was a professor of surgery at the [[University at Buffalo]] School of Medicine. It was the first institute to focus on cancer treatment and research in the world. Dr Roswell Park saw that there was a need for cancer care and acted.

Dr Park said that “Only through a deliberate well-planned, combined attack from various directions by means fitted for such work could real advances be made and further the relationship of laboratory work, clinical study and education must be closely associated.
<ref>Mirand, Dr. Edwin A., Legacy and History of Roswell Park Cancer Institute 1898-1998. Virginia Beach, VA: The Donning Company Publishers pg 9</ref>

Research started in three rooms in the University at Buffalo School of Medicine. It did not take long to outgrow those three rooms. Buffalo citizens saw the importance of cancer research and decided to donate money to purchase land and a new building. The biggest contributor was Mrs. William Gratwik who donated $25,000. The Gratwick Research Laboratory of the University at Buffalo was constructed in 1901. It was located on High and Elm in Buffalo, New York.

Dr. Park was a busy man; he wrote many books, gave lectures, and was the administrator at the cancer research center. In 1904 Dr. Park stepped down from and Dr. Harvey R. Gaylord took over as the second director of the institute. Dr. Park remained as the head chairman of the board of trustees.
