'''Muscle tissue''' is one of four basic [[Tissue (biology)|biological tissues]] present in animals.  It is a [[soft tissue]] that composes [[muscle]]s.  It is formed during embryo development in a process known as [[myogenesis]].

==Types== 
Muscle cells (myocytes) are elongated and classified and or compatible as either striated muscle cells or smooth muscle cells depending on the presence or absence, respectively, of organized, regularly repeated arrangements of myofibrillar contractile proteins called myofilaments. Striated muscle is further classified as either skeletal or cardiac muscle.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pratt|first=Rebecca|title=Muscle Tissue|url=https://app.anatomyone.com/systemic/muscular-system/muscle-tissue#|work=AnatomyOne|publisher=Amirsys, Inc|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref>  Thus, muscle tissue can be described as being one of three different types:
* [[Skeletal muscle]] or "voluntary muscle" is anchored by [[tendon]]s (or by [[aponeurosis|aponeuroses]] at a few places) to [[bone]] and is used to effect [[skeleton|skeletal]] movement such as [[animal locomotion|locomotion]] and in maintaining posture. Though this postural control is generally maintained as an unconscious reflex, the muscles responsible react to conscious control like non-postural muscles. An average adult male is made up of 42% of skeletal muscle and an average adult female is made up of 36% (as a percentage of body mass).<ref name="Marieb & Hoehn 2007" /> It also has striations unlike smooth muscle.
* [[Smooth muscle]] or "involuntary muscle" is found within the walls of organs and structures such as the [[esophagus]], [[stomach]], [[intestine]]s, [[bronchus|bronchi]], [[uterus]], [[urethra]], [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], [[blood vessel]]s, and the [[erectores pilorum|arrector pili]] in the skin (in which it controls erection of body hair). Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle is not under conscious  control.

In [[vertebrate]]s, there is a third muscle tissue recognized:
* [[Cardiac muscle]] is also an "involuntary muscle" but is more akin in structure to skeletal muscle, and is found only in the heart.

Cardiac and skeletal muscles are "striated" in that they contain [[sarcomere]]s and are packed into highly regular arrangements of bundles; smooth muscle has neither. While skeletal muscles are arranged in regular, parallel bundles, cardiac muscle connects at branching, irregular angles (called intercalated discs). Striated muscle contracts and relaxes in short, intense bursts, whereas smooth muscle sustains longer or even near-permanent contractions.

==Skeletal muscle==
{{main|Skeletal striated muscle}}
[[File:Musculoesqueleticovoluntario.jpg|thumb|Striated skeletal muscle cells in microscopic view.  The myofibers are oriented vertically; the horizontal striations (lighter and darker bands) that are visible result from differences in composition and density of fibrils within the cells.  The short dark patches to the side of the myofibers are cell nuclei.]]

Skeletal muscle is further divided into several subtypes:
* Type I, slow oxidative, slow twitch, or "red" muscle is dense with [[capillary|capillaries]] and is rich in [[mitochondria]] and [[myoglobin]], giving the muscle tissue its characteristic red color. It can carry more [[oxygen]] and sustain [[aerobic metabolism|aerobic]] activity.
**Type I muscle fiber are sometimes broken down into Type I and Type Ic categories, as a result of recent research.<ref name="McCloud" />
* Type II, fast twitch muscle, has three major kinds that are, in order of increasing contractile speed:<ref name="Larsson 1991" />
**Type IIa, which, like slow muscle, is aerobic, rich in mitochondria and capillaries and appears red when deoxygenated.
**Type IIx (also known as type IId), which is less dense in mitochondria and myoglobin. This is the fastest muscle type in humans. It can contract more quickly and with a greater amount of force than oxidative muscle, but can sustain only short, [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic]] bursts of activity before muscle contraction becomes painful (often incorrectly attributed to a build-up of [[lactic acid]]). N.B. in some books and articles this muscle in humans was, confusingly, called type IIB.<ref name="Smerdu 1994" />
**Type IIb, which is anaerobic, [[glycolysis|glycolytic]], "white" muscle that is even less dense in mitochondria and myoglobin. In small animals like rodents this is the major fast muscle type, explaining the pale color of their flesh.
