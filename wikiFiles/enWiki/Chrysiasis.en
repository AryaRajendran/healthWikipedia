'''Chrysiasis''' (Gk, ''chrysos'' - 'gold', ''osis'' - 'condition of') is a dermatological condition induced by the [[parenteral]] administration of gold salts, usually for the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{rp|859-60}} Such treatment has been superseded as the best practice for treating the disease because of "numerous side effects and monitoring {{sic|requirments}}, their limited efficacy, and very slow onset of action".<ref>http://www.hopkins-arthritis.org/arthritis-info/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheum_treat.html#gold</ref>

Similar to [[silver]], a gold preparation used [[parenteral]]ly for a long period may rarely produce a permanent skin [[pigmentation]] - especially if the skin is exposed to sunlight or artificial [[ultraviolet]] radiation. 

The skin's pigmentation (in this condition) has been described as uniformly gray, grayish purple, slate gray, or grayish blue, and is usually limited to exposed portions of the body. It may involve the conjunctivae over the [[sclera]]s but usually not the [[oral mucosa]]. Location of pigment predominantly in the upper [[dermis]] leads to the blue component of skin color through the [[scattering|scattering phenomenon]]. It is much less likely to be deposited in the nails and hair. 

Chrysiasis was said to have been much more common when medicines containing traces of gold were used for treatment of [[tuberculosis]] (commonplace forms of treatment nearly fifty years ago). Treatments containing gold traces were also used to treat cases of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] - but because the dose used for tuberculosis was higher than for [[arthritis]], it has not afflicted many subscribing to such treatments. 

Gold can be identified in the skin chemically by [[light microscopy]], [[electron microscopy]], and spectroscopy. 

There is no way to reverse or treat chrysiasis.
