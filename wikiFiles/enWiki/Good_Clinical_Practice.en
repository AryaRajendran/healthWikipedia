'''Good Clinical Practice (GCP)''' is an international quality standard that is provided by [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|International Conference on Harmonisation]] (ICH), an international body that defines standards, which governments can transpose into regulations for [[clinical trial]]s involving human subjects.

Good Clinical Practice guidelines include protection of human rights as a subject in clinical trial. It also provides assurance of the safety and efficacy of the newly developed compounds.

Good Clinical Practice Guidelines include standards on how clinical trials should be conducted, define the roles and responsibilities of [[clinical trial]] sponsors, clinical research investigators, and monitors. In the pharmaceutical industry monitors are often called [[Clinical Research Associate]]s.
