'''Marburg virus disease (MVD)''' is the name for the human disease caused by any of the two [[marburgvirus]]es [[Marburg virus]] (MARV) and [[Ravn virus]] (RAVV). MVD is a [[viral hemorrhagic fever]] (VHF), and the clinical symptoms are indistinguishable from [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola virus disease (EVD)]].
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Classification==
Marburg virus disease (MVD) is the official name listed in the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] 10 (ICD-10) for the human disease caused by any of the two [[marburgvirus]]es [[Marburg virus]] (MARV) and [[Ravn virus]] (RAVV). In the scientific literature,  Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF) is often used as an unofficial alternative name for the same disease. Both disease names are derived from the [[Germany|German]] city [[Marburg]], where MARV was first discovered.<ref name=Siegert1967>{{Cite pmid|4294540}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The most detailed study on the frequency, onset, and duration of MVD [[medical sign|clinical signs]] and [[symptom]]s was performed during the 1998–2000 mixed MARV/RAVV disease outbreak.<ref name=Bausch2006>{{Cite pmid|16943403}}</ref> A [[Cutaneous conditions|maculopapular]] [[rash]], [[petechia]]e, [[purpura]], [[Ecchymosis|ecchymoses]], and [[hematoma]]s (especially around needle injection sites) are typical hemorrhagic manifestations. However, contrary to popular belief, hemorrhage does not lead to [[hypovolemia]] and is not the cause of [[death]] (total blood loss is minimal except during [[Childbirth|labor]]). Instead, death occurs due to [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)]] due to fluid redistribution, [[hypotension]], [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]], and focal [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[necrosis|necroses]].<ref name=Bausch2006/><ref name=Martini1968>{{Cite pmid|4966280}}</ref><ref name=Stille1968>{{Cite pmid|4966281}}</ref><ref name=Martini1971>{{Citation|last1 = Martini|first1 = G.

Clinical phases of Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever's presentation are described below. Note that phases overlap due to variability between cases.

# '''Incubation''': 2–21 days, averaging 5–9 days. 
# '''Generalization Phase''': Day 1 up to Day 5 from onset of clinical symptoms. MHF presents with a high fever (~40˚C) and a sudden, severe headache, with accompanying chills, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pharyngitis, maculopapular rash, abdominal pain, conjunctivitis, & malaise. 
# '''Early Organ Phase''': Day 5 up to Day 13. Symptoms include [[prostration]], [[dyspnea]], [[edema]], [[conjunctival injection]], viral [[exanthema]], and CNS symptoms, including encephalitis, confusion, delirium, apathy, and aggression. Hemorrhagic symptoms typically occur late and herald the end of the early organ phase, leading either to eventual recovery or worsening & death. Symptoms include bloody stools, ecchymoses, blood leakage from [[venipuncture]] sites, mucosal & visceral hemorrhaging, and possibly [[hematemesis]].
# '''Late Organ Phase''': Day 13 up to Day 21+. Symptoms bifurcate into two constellations for survivors & fatal cases. Survivors will enter a '''convalescence phase''', experiencing [[myalgia]], [[Fibromyalgia|fibromyalgia]], [[hepatitis]], [[asthenia]], ocular symptoms, & [[psychosis]]. Fatal cases continue to deteriorate, experiencing continued fever, [[obtundation]], [[coma]], [[convulsions]], diffuse [[coagulopathy]], metabolic disturbances, [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and death, with death typically occurring between Days 8 and 16.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mehedi|first=Masfique|coauthors=Allison Groseth, Heinz Feldmann, Hideki Ebihara|title=Clinical aspects of Marburg hemorrhagic fever|journal=Future Virol.|year=2011|month=September|volume=9|pages=1091–1106|doi=10.2217/fvl.11.79}}</ref>

MVD is caused by two viruses classified in the genus ''[[Marburgvirus]]'', family ''[[Filoviridae]]'', order ''[[Mononegavirales]]'': [[Marburg virus|Marburg virus (MARV)]] and [[Ravn virus|Ravn virus (RAVV)]].

Marburgviruses are endemic in [[arid]] [[woodland]]s of [[equatorial Africa]].<ref name=Peterson2004>{{Cite pmid|15078595}}</ref><ref name=Pinzon2005>{{Cite pmid|16267968}}</ref><ref name=Peterson2006>{{Cite pmid|16837700}}</ref> Most marburgvirus infections were repeatedly associated with people visiting natural [[cave]]s or working in [[mining|mines]]. In 2009, the successful isolation of infectious MARV and RAVV was reported from healthy [[Egyptian fruit bat|Egyptian rousettes (''Rousettus aegyptiacus'')]] caught in caves.<ref name=Towner2009>{{Cite pmid|19649327}}</ref> This isolation strongly suggests that [[Old World]] [[Megabat|fruit bat]]s are involved in the natural maintenance of marburgviruses and that visiting bat-infested caves is a risk factor for acquiring marburgvirus infections. Further studies are necessary to establish whether Egyptian rousettes are the actual hosts of MARV and RAVV or whether they get infected via contact with another animal and therefore serve only as intermediate hosts. Another risk factor is contact with nonhuman primates, although only one outbreak of MVD (in 1967) was due to contact with infected monkeys.<ref name=Siegert1967/> Finally, a major risk factor for acquiring marburgvirus infection is occupational exposure, i.e. treating patients with MVD without proper [[personal protective equipment]].

===Virology===
{{Main| Marburg virus}}

====Genome====
Like all [[Mononegavirales|mononegaviruses]], marburgvirions contain non-infectious, linear nonsegmented, single-stranded [[RNA]] [[genome]]s of negative polarity that possesses inverse-complementary 3' and 5' termini, do not possess a [[5' cap]], are not [[Polyadenylation|polyadenylated]], and are not [[Covalent bond|covalently]] linked to a [[protein]].<ref name=Fauquet2005>{{Citation|last1=Pringle|first1=C. R.|chapter=Order Mononegavirales|year=2005|editor-last=Fauquet|editor-first=C. M.|editor2-last=Mayo|editor2-first=M. A.|editor3-last=Maniloff|editor3-first=J.|editor4-last=Desselberger|editor4-first=U.|editor5-last=Ball|editor5-first=L. A.|title=Virus Taxonomy—Eighth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|pages=609–614|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|location=San Diego, USA|isbn=0-12-370200-3}}</ref> Marburgvirus genomes are approximately 19 [[base pair|kb]] long and contain seven [[gene]]s in the order [[Three prime untranslated region|3'-UTR]]-''NP''-''VP35''-''VP40''-''GP''-''VP30''-''VP24''-''L''-[[Five prime untranslated region|5'-UTR]].<ref name = Kiley1982>{{Cite pmid|7118520}}</ref> The genomes of the two different marburgviruses (MARV and RAVV) differ in [[nucleic acid sequence|sequence]].

====Structure====
Like all [[Filoviridae|filoviruses]], marburgvirions are filamentous particles that may appear in the shape of a shepherd's crook or in the shape of a "U" or a "6", and they may be coiled, toroid, or branched.<ref name = Kiley1982/> Marburgvirions are generally 80&nbsp;nm in [[width]], but vary somewhat in length. In general, the median particle length of marburgviruses ranges from 795–828&nbsp;nm (in contrast to ebolavirions, whose median particle length was measured to be 974–1,086&nbsp;nm ), but particles as long as 14,000&nbsp;nm have been detected in tissue culture.<ref name = Geisbert1995>{{Cite pmid|8837880}}</ref> Marburgvirions consist of seven structural proteins. At the center is the [[helical]] [[ribonucleoprotein|ribonucleocapsid]], which consists of the genomic RNA wrapped around a [[polymer]] of [[nucleoprotein]]s (NP). Associated with the ribonucleoprotein is the [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] (L) with the polymerase cofactor (VP35) and a transcription activator (VP30). The ribonucleoprotein is embedded in a matrix, formed by the major (VP40) and minor (VP24) matrix proteins. These particles are surrounded by a [[lipid bilayer|lipid membrane]] derived from the host cell membrane. The membrane anchors a glycoprotein (GP<sub>1,2</sub>) that projects 7 to 10&nbsp;nm spikes away from its surface. While nearly identical to ebolavirions in structure, marburgvirions are [[antigen]]ically distinct.

====Replication====
The marburgvirus [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] begins with virion attachment to specific cell-surface [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, followed by [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fusion]] of the virion envelope with cellular membranes and the concomitant release of the virus [[nucleocapsid]] into the [[cytosol]]. The virus RdRp partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribes]] the [[genes]] into positive-stranded [[mRNA]]s, which are then [[translation (biology)|translated]] into structural and nonstructural [[proteins]]. Marburgvirus L binds to a single [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription either terminates after a gene or continues to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome are transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end are least likely to be transcribed. The gene order is therefore a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced is the [[nucleoprotein]], whose [[concentration]] in the cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication results in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that are in turn transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the [[cell membrane]]. Virions [[Budding|bud]] off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane they bud from. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle.<ref name=Feldmann2005>{{Citation|last1=Feldmann|first1=H.|last2=Geisbert|first2=T. W.|last3=Jahrling|first3=P.

==Diagnosis==
MVD is clinically indistinguishable from [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola virus disease (EVD)]], and it can also easily be confused with many other diseases prevalent in [[Equatorial Africa]], such as other [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]s, [[malaria|falciparum malaria]], [[typhoid fever]], [[shigellosis]], [[rickettsia|rickettsial diseases]] such as [[typhus]], [[cholera]], [[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]] [[sepsis|septicemia]], [[borreliosis]] such as [[relapsing fever]] or [[Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli|EHEC enteritis]]. Other infectious diseases that ought to be included in the [[differential diagnosis]] include [[leptospirosis]], [[scrub typhus]], [[plague (disease)|plague]], [[Q fever]], [[candidiasis]], [[histoplasmosis]], [[trypanosomiasis]], [[visceral]] [[leishmaniasis]], hemorrhagic [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and fulminant [[viral hepatitis]]. Non-infectious diseases that can be confused with MVD are [[acute promyelocytic leukemia]], [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]], [[snake]] [[envenomation]], [[coagulation|clotting factor]] deficiencies/platelet disorders, [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia]], [[Kawasaki disease]], and even [[warfarin]] intoxication.<ref name=Gear1989>{{Cite pmid|2665013}}</ref><ref name=Gear1978>{{Cite pmid|565951}}</ref><ref name=Grolla2005>{{Cite pmid|16267962}}</ref><ref name=Bogomolov1998>{{Cite pmid|9612907}}</ref> The most important indicator that may lead to the suspicion of MVD at clinical examination is the [[medical history]] of the patient, in particular the travel and occupational history (which countries and caves were visited?) and the patient's exposure to wildlife (exposure to bats or bat excrements?). MVD can be confirmed by isolation of marburgviruses from or by detection of marburgvirus antigen or genomic or subgenomic RNAs in patient [[blood]] or [[Blood serum|serum]] samples during the acute phase of MVD. Marburgvirus isolation is usually performed by [[inoculation]] of [[grivet]] kidney epithelial [[Vero cell|Vero E6]] or MA-104 [[cell culture]]s or by inoculation of human adrenal carcinoma SW-13 cells, all of which react to infection with characteristic [[cytopathic effect]]s.<ref name=Hofmann1968>{{Cite pmid|4988544}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Ksiazek | first = Thomas G. | year = 1991 | title = Laboratory diagnosis of filovirus infections in nonhuman primates | journal = Lab Animal | volume = 20 | issue = 7 | pages = 34–6}}</ref> Filovirions can easily be visualized and identified in cell culture by [[electron microscopy]] due to their unique filamentous shapes, but electron microscopy cannot differentiate the various filoviruses alone despite some overall length differences.<ref name=Geisbert1995>{{Cite pmid|8837880}}</ref> [[Immunofluorescence|Immunofluorescence assays]] are used to confirm marburgvirus presence in cell cultures. During an outbreak, virus isolation and electron microscopy are most often not feasible options. The most common diagnostic methods are therefore [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]]<ref name=Gibb2001>{{Cite pmid|11735297}}</ref><ref name=Drosten2002>{{Cite pmid|12089242}}</ref><ref name=Weidmann2004>{{Cite pmid|15072761}}</ref><ref name=Zhai2007>{{Cite pmid|17079496}}</ref><ref name=Weidmann2007>{{Cite pmid|17360231}}</ref> in conjunction with [[ELISA|antigen-capture ELISA]],<ref name=Saijo2005>{{Cite pmid|15778962}}</ref><ref name=Saijo2006-1>{{Cite pmid|16603611}}</ref><ref name=Saijo2006-2>{{Cite pmid|17060700}}</ref> which can be performed in field or mobile hospitals and laboratories. [[Immunofluorescence|Indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs)]] are not used for diagnosis of MVD in the field anymore.

==Prevention==
There are currently no [[Food and Drug Administration]]-approved [[vaccine]]s for the prevention of MVD. Many candidate vaccines have been developed and tested in various animal models.<ref name=Warfield2004>{{Cite pmid|15308377}}</ref><ref name=Hevey1997>{{Cite pmid|9426460}}</ref><ref name=Swenson2005>{{Cite pmid|15811650}}</ref><ref name=Hevey2002>{{Cite pmid|11672925}}</ref><ref name=Riemenschneider2003>{{Cite pmid|12922144}}</ref><ref name=Wang2006>{{Cite pmid|16820184}}</ref><ref name=Hevey1998>{{Cite pmid|9813200}}</ref><ref name=Garbutt2004>{{Cite pmid|15113924}}</ref><ref name=Jones2005>{{Cite pmid|15937495}}</ref><ref name=Daddario-DiCaprio2006>{{Cite pmid|16973570}}</ref><ref name=Swenson2008>{{Cite pmid|18444889}}</ref> Of those, the most promising ones are [[DNA vaccination|DNA vaccines]]<ref name=Riemenschneider2003/> or based on [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]] [[Replicon (genetics)|replicons]],<ref name=Hevey1998/> [[vesicular stomatitis virus|vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV)]]<ref name=Jones2005/><ref name=Daddario-DiCaprio2006/> or [[virus-like particle|filovirus-like particles (VLPs)]]<ref name=Swenson2008/> as all of these candidates could protect nonhuman primates from marburgvirus-induced disease. DNA vaccines have entered clinical trials.<ref name="NIAIDVaccineDevelopment">{{Cite press release|title=Ebola/Marburg Vaccine Development|publisher=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|date=2008-09-15|url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/ebolaMarburg/default.htm}}</ref> Marburgviruses are highly [[infection|infectious]], but not very [[Contagious disease|contagious]]. Importantly, and contrary to popular belief, marburgviruses do not get transmitted by [[aerosol]] during natural MVD outbreaks. Due to the absence of an approved vaccine, prevention of MVD therefore relies predominantly on behavior modification, proper [[personal protective equipment]], and [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]]/[[disinfection]].

===In endemic zones===
The natural maintenance hosts of marburg viruses remain to be identified unequivocally. However, the isolation of both MARV and RAVV from [[bat]]s and the association of several MVD outbreaks with bat-infested mines or caves strongly suggests that bats are involved in marburg virus transmission to humans. Avoidance of contact with bats and abstaining from visits to caves is highly recommended, but may not be possible for those working in mines or people dependent on bats as a food source.

===During outbreaks===
Since marburgviruses are not spreading via aerosol, the most straightforward prevention method during MVD outbreaks is to avoid direct (skin-to-skin) contact with patients, their [[excretion]]s and [[body fluids]], or possibly [[contamination|contaminated]] materials and utensils. Patients ought to be isolated but still have the right to be visited by family members. Medical staff should be trained and apply strict barrier nursing techniques (disposable face mask, gloves, goggles, and a gown at all times). Traditional [[burial]] rituals, especially those requiring [[embalming]] of bodies, ought to be discouraged or modified, ideally with the help of local [[traditional healer]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization|title=Infection Control for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers in the African Health Care Setting|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual/entire.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-05-31|year=1998|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|location=Atlanta, Georgia, USA|ref=CITEREFCDCWHO1998}}</ref>

===In the laboratory===
Marburgviruses are [[World Health Organization]] Risk Group 4 Pathogens, requiring [[Biosafety|Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment]].<ref name=BMBL5>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/|title=Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5th Edition|accessdate=2011-10-16|last=US Department of Health and Human Services}}</ref> Laboratory researchers have to be properly trained in BSL-4 practices and wear proper personal protective equipment.

==Treatment==
There is currently no effective marburgvirus-specific [[therapy]] for MVD. Treatment is primarily supportive in nature and includes minimizing invasive procedures, balancing fluids and [[electrolyte]]s to counter [[dehydration]], administration of [[anticoagulants]] early in infection to prevent or control [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]], administration of [[coagulation|procoagulants]] late in infection to control [[bleeding|hemorrhaging]], maintaining [[oxygen]] levels, [[pain management]], and administration of [[antibacterial|antibiotics]] or [[antifungal medication|antimycotics]] to treat secondary infections.<ref>{{Cite pmid|17940941}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|16483416}}</ref> Experimentally, recombinant [[Vesicular stomatitis virus|vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus]] (VSIV) expressing the glycoprotein of MARV has been used successfully in nonhuman primate models as post-exposure prophylaxis.<ref>{{Cite pmid|16650649}}</ref> Novel, very promising, experimental therapeutic regimens rely on [[antisense therapy|antisense technology]]: [[Morpholino|phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers]] (PMOs) targeting the MARV genome could prevent disease in nonhuman primates.<ref>{{Cite pmid|20729866}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is generally poor (average [[case-fatality rate]] of all MVD outbreaks to date = 82%). If a patient survives, recovery may be prompt and complete, or protracted with [[sequela]]e, such as [[orchitis]], [[hepatitis]], [[uveitis]], [[parotitis]], [[desquamation]] or [[alopecia]]. Importantly, MARV is known to be able to persist in some survivors and to either reactivate and cause a secondary bout of MVD or to be transmitted via [[sperm]], causing secondary cases of infection and disease.<ref name=Nikiforov1994/><ref name=Martini1968-2>{{Cite pmid|4971902}}</ref><ref name=Siegert1968>{{Cite pmid|4966286}}</ref><ref name=Kuming1977>{{Cite pmid|557985}}</ref>

Of the 252 people who contracted Marburg during the 2004–2005 outbreak in Angola, 227 died, for a case fatality rate of 90%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/marburg/marburgtable.htm |title=Known Cases and Outbreaks of Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever, in Chronological Order |author=|date=July 31, 2009 |work= |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref>

Although all age groups are susceptible to infection, children are rarely infected. In the 1998–2000 Congo epidemic, only 8% of the cases were children less than 5 years old.<ref name=WHO>{{cite web |url=http://allcountries.org/health/marburg_haemorrhagic_fever.html |title=Marburg haemorrhagic fever |work=Health Topics A to Z |accessdate=2011-09-25}}</ref>

===1967 outbreak===
MVD was first documented in 1967, when 31 people became ill in the [[Germany|German]] towns of [[Marburg]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]], and in [[Belgrade]], [[Yugoslavia]]. The outbreak involved 25 primary MARV infections and seven deaths, and six nonlethal secondary cases. The outbreak was traced to infected [[grivet]]s (species ''Chlorocebus aethiops'') imported from an undisclosed location in [[Uganda]] and used in developing [[poliomyelitis]] [[vaccines]]. The monkeys were received by Behringwerke, a Marburg [[company (law)|company]] founded by the first winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]], [[Emil von Behring]]. The company, which at the time was owned by [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]], was originally set up to develop [[blood plasma|sera]] against [[tetanus]] and [[diphtheria]]. Primary infections occurred in Behringwerke [[laboratory]] staff while working with grivet tissues or tissue cultures without adequate [[personal protective equipment]]. Secondary cases involved two [[physician]]s, a [[nurse]], a post-mortem attendant, and the wife of a [[veterinarian]]. All secondary cases had direct contact, usually involving blood, with a primary case. Both physicians became infected through accidental skin pricks when drawing blood from patients.<ref name=Siegert1967/>

===1975 cases===
In 1975, an Australian tourist became infected with MARV in [[Rhodesia]] (today [[Zimbabwe]]). He died in a hospital in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. His girlfriend and an attending nurse subsequently came down with MVD, but survived.<ref name=Gear1975/><ref name=Gear1977/><ref name=Conrad1978/>

===1980 cases===
A case of MARV infection occurred in 1980 in [[Kenya]]. A French man, who worked as an electrical engineer in a sugar factory in Nzoia (close to [[Bungoma]]) at the base of [[Mount Elgon]] (which contains [[Kitum Cave]]), became infected by unknown means and died shortly after admission to [[Nairobi]] Hospital. The attending physician contracted MVD, but survived.<ref name=Smith1982/> A popular science account of these cases can be found in [[Richard Preston]]’s book ''[[The Hot Zone]]'' (the French man is referred to under the [[pseudonym]] “Charles Monet”, whereas the physician is identified under his real name Shem Musoke).<ref name=Preston1994>{{cite book |last1=Preston|first1=Richard|authorlink=Richard Preston|year=1994|title=The Hot Zone – A Terrifying New Story|publisher= Random Hourse|location=New York, USA|isbn=0-385-47956-5}}</ref>

===1987 case===
In 1987, a single lethal case of RAVV infection occurred in a 15-year-old Danish boy, who spent his vacation in [[Kisumu]], [[Kenya]]. He had visited [[Kitum Cave]] on [[Mount Elgon]] prior to travelling to [[Mombasa]], where he developed clinical signs of infection. The boy died after transfer to [[Nairobi]] Hospital.<ref name=Johnson1996/> A popular science account of this case can be found in [[Richard Preston]]’s book ''[[The Hot Zone]]'' (the boy is referred to under the [[pseudonym]] “Peter Cardinal”).<ref name=Preston1994/>

===1988 laboratory infection===
In 1988, researcher Nikolai Ustinov infected himself lethally with MARV after accidentally pricking himself with a syringe used for inoculation of [[guinea pig]]s. The accident occurred at the Scientific-Production Association "Vektor" (today the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR|State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology "Vektor"]]) in [[Koltsovo]], [[USSR]] (today [[Russia]]).<ref name=Beer1999/> Very little information is publicly available about this MVD case because Ustinov’s experiments were classified. A popular science account of this case can be found in [[Ken Alibek]]’s book ''Biohazard''.<ref name=Alibek1999>{{Citation|last1=Alibek|first1=Ken|last2=Handelman|first2=Steven|authorlink=Ken Alibek|title=Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World—Told from Inside by the Man Who Ran It|publisher=Random House|location=New York, USA|isbn=0-385-33496-6}}</ref>

===1990 laboratory infection===
Another laboratory accident occurred at the Scientific-Production Association "Vektor" (today the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR|State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology "Vektor"]]) in [[Koltsovo]], [[USSR]], when a scientist contracted MARV by unknown means.<ref name=Nikiforov1994/>

===1998–2000 outbreak===
A major MVD outbreak occurred among illegal [[gold mine]]rs around Goroumbwa mine in [[Durba, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Durba]] and [[Watsa]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] from 1998 to 2000, when co-circulating MARV and RAVV caused 154 cases of MVD and 128 deaths. The outbreak ended with the flooding of the mine.<ref name=Bausch2006/><ref name=Bertherat1999/><ref name=Bausch2003/>

===2004–2005 outbreak===
In early 2005, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) began investigating an outbreak of [[viral hemorrhagic fever]] in [[Angola]], which was centered in the northeastern [[Uíge Province]] but also affected many other provinces. The Angolan government had to ask for international assistance, pointing out that there were only approximately 1,200 doctors in the entire country, with some provinces having as few as two. Health care workers also complained about a shortage of [[personal protective equipment]] such as gloves, gowns, and masks. [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF) reported that when their team arrived at the provincial hospital at the center of the outbreak, they found it operating without [[water]] and [[electricity]]. [[Contact tracing]] was complicated by the fact that the country's roads and other infrastructure have been devastated after nearly three decades of [[Angolan War of Independence|civil war]] and the countryside remained littered with [[land mine]]s. Americo Boa Vida Hospital in the Angolan [[Capital (political)|capital]] [[Luanda]] set up a special isolation ward to treat infected people from the countryside. Unfortunately, because MVD often results in death, some people came to view hospitals and medical workers with suspicion and treated helpers with hostility. For instance, a specially-equipped isolation ward at the provincial hospital in Uíge was reported to be empty during much of the epidemic, even though the facility was at the center of the outbreak. WHO was forced to implement what it described as a "harm reduction strategy", which entailed distributing disinfectants to affected families who refused hospital care. Of the 252 people who contracted MVD during outbreak, 227 died.<ref name=Roddy2010/><ref name=Hovette2005/><ref name=Ndayimirije2005/><ref name=Towner2006/><ref name=Jeffs2007/><ref name=Roddy2007/><ref name=Roddy2009/>

===2007 cases===
In 2007, four [[miner]]s became infected with marburgviruses in [[Kamwenge District]], [[Uganda]]. The first case, a 29-year-old man, became symptomatic on July 4, 2007, was admitted to a hospital on July 7, and died on July 13. Contact tracing revealed that the man had had prolonged close contact with two colleagues (a 22-year-old man and a 23-year-old man), who experienced clinical signs of infection before his disease onset. Both men had been admitted to hospitals in June and survived their infections, which were proven to be due to MARV. A fourth, 25-year-old man, developed MVD clinical signs in September and was shown to be infected with RAVV. He also survived the infection.<ref name=Towner2009/><ref name=Adjemian2011/>

===2008 cases===
On July 10, 2008, the [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] reported that a 41-year-old Dutch woman, who had visited Python Cave in [[Maramagambo Forest]] during her holiday in [[Uganda]] suffered of MVD due to MARV infection, and had been admitted to a hospital in the [[Netherlands]]. The woman died under treatment in the [[Leiden University Medical Centre]] in [[Leiden]] on July 11. The Ugandan Ministry of Health closed the cave after this case.<ref name=Timen2009/> On January 9 of that year an infectious diseases physician notified the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment that a 44-year-old American woman who had returned from [[Uganda]] had been hospitalized with a [[Fever of unknown origin|fever of unknown origin]]. At the time, serologic testing was negative for [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]. She was discharged on January 19, 2008. After the death of the Dutch patient and the discovery that the American woman had visited Python Cave, further testing confirmed the patient demonstrated MARV [[antibodies]] and [[RNA]].<ref name=CDC2009/>
