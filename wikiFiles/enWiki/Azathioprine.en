'''Azathioprine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], {{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|æ|z|ə|ˈ|θ|aɪ|ɵ|p|r|iː|n}}, abbreviated '''AZA''') is an [[immunosuppressive drug]] used in [[organ transplant]]ation and [[autoimmune disease]]s and belongs to the chemical class of [[purine analogue]]s.<ref name="ahf" /> Synthesized originally as a cancer drug and a pro-drug for [[mercaptopurine]] in 1957, it has been widely used as a immunosuppressant for more than 50 years.<ref name="nobel" /> 

Azathioprine acts as a pro-drug for [[mercaptopurine]], inhibiting an [[enzyme]] that is required for the synthesis of [[DNA]]. Thus it most strongly affects proliferating cells, such as the [[T cell]]s and [[B cell]]s of the [[immune system]].<ref name=Example2006 /><ref name="derma" />

The main adverse effect of azathioprine is [[bone marrow suppression]], which can be life-threatening, especially in people with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme [[thiopurine S-methyltransferase]].<ref name="pmid12891528" /> It is also listed by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] as a [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]] (carcinogenic to humans).<ref name="IARC-1987" />

Azathioprine is produced by a number of manufacturers under different brand names ('''Azasan''' by Salix in the U.S., '''Imuran''' by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] in Canada, the U.S., Australia, Ireland and Great Britain,<ref name="ahf" /> '''Azamun''' in Finland and '''Imurel''' in Scandinavia and France, among others).<ref name="IARC-1987" />

==Medical uses==
Azathioprine is used alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive therapy to prevent [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] following organ transplantation, and to treat an array of [[autoimmune disease]]s, including [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[pemphigus]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[Behçet's disease]] and other forms of [[vasculitis]], [[autoimmune hepatitis]], [[atopic dermatitis]], [[myasthenia gravis]], [[neuromyelitis optica]] (Devic's disease), [[restrictive lung disease]], and others.<ref name="derma">{{Cite journal | last1 = Patel | first1 = A.

===Kidney or Liver transplantation===
Azathioprine is used to prevent rejections of kidney or liver [[allograft]]s, usually in conjunction with other therapies including [[corticosteroids]], other immunosuppressants, and local [[radiation therapy]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Nuyttens | first1 = J.

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
Being a [[disease-modifying antirheumatic drug]] (DMARD), azathioprine  has been  used for the management of the signs and symptoms of adult [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Suarez-Almazor | first1 = M.

===Others===
Azathioprine is sometimes used in systemic lupus erythematosus patients who require a maintenance dose of 15&nbsp;mg or higher of [[prednisone]] and those who experience recurrent flares.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1191/096120301676669495}}</ref>

It is used as an [[adjuvant]] in the oral steroid therapy of pemphigus and myasthenia gravis, as a "steroid-sparing" agent for reducing the dose of cortisteroids.<ref name="derma" /><ref>{{cite pmid|17428113}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|14694025}}</ref>

It was shown to be very effective in eczema and atopic dermatitis in researches, even though it is not commonly used.<ref name="derma" /> The British National Eczema Society lists it as a [[Drug of last resort|third-line treatment]] for severe to moderate cases of these skin diseases.<ref>{{cite pmid|16530578}}</ref>

It was widely used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis until the first half of the 1990s. Concerns about increased risk of malignancy has led to a decreased use, yet it is still used in maintenance treatment for patients who frequently [[relapse]].<ref>{{cite pmid|19151017}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
[[File:000040lg Azathioprine 50 MG Oral Tablet .jpg|thumb|260px|left|An example of azathioprine 50&nbsp;mg oral tablets]]
Nausea and vomiting are common adverse effects, especially at the beginning of a treatment. Such cases are met with taking azathioprine after meals or transient [[intravenous]] administration. Side effects that are probably [[hypersensitivity]] reactions include dizziness, diarrhea, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and [[skin rashes]]. Hair loss is often seen in transplant patients receiving the drug, but rarely occurs under other indications. Because azathioprine [[bone marrow suppression|suppresses the bone marrow]], patients can develop [[anaemia]] and will be more susceptible to [[infection]]; regular monitoring of the [[blood count]] is  recommended during treatment.<ref name="ahf" /><ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|pages=4103–9|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|language=German}}</ref> [[Acute pancreatitis]] can also occur, especially in patients with Crohn's disease.<ref name="APT2004">{{cite journal| author = Weersma, R.

Under FDA rules, like many other immunosuppressants, the use of this drug excludes eligibility for [[blood donation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arthritis.about.com/od/arthqa/f/blooddonation.htm |title=Blood Donation - Are rheumatoid arthritis patients able to donate blood? |author=Carol Eustice |date=October 23, 2005 |work= |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}</ref>

===Cancers===
Azathioprine is listed as a human [[carcinogen]] in the 12th Report on Carcinogens by the [[National Toxicology Program]] of [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], asserting that it is "known to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans."<ref name="roc2011">{{cite web|author=[[National Toxicology Program]]|title=Report On Carcinogens – Twelfth Edition – 2011|date=10 June 2011|url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/roc12.pdf|publisher=[[National Toxicology Program]]|format=PDF|accessdate=June 20, 2012 }}</ref> Since August 2009, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] has required warnings to be placed on packaging with respect to increased risks of certain cancers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm175803.htm |title=FDA: Cancer Warnings Required for TNF Blockers |author= |date=August 4, 2009 |work= |publisher=FDA |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref>

The risks involved seem to be related both to the duration and to the dosage used. People who have previously been treated with an [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]] may have an excessive risk of cancers if treated with azathioprine. Epidemiological studies by [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) have provided "sufficient" evidence of azathioprine carcinogenicity in humans ([[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1]]),<ref name="IARC-1981">{{cite journal| author = International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)| authorlink = International Agency for Research on Cancer | year = 1981| url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol26/azathioprine.html| title = Azathioprine – 5.

The various diseases requiring transplantation may in themselves increase the risks of [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[squamous cell carcinoma]]s of the skin, [[Cholangiocarcinoma|hepatobiliary carcinomas]], and [[Mesenchyme|mesenchymal tumours]] to which azathioprine may add additional risks. Those receiving azathioprine for rheumatoid arthritis may have a lower risk than those undergoing transplantation.<ref name="IARC-1987">{{cite journal| author = International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)| authorlink = International Agency for Research on Cancer| year = 1987| url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/suppl7/azathioprine.html| title = Azathioprine | work = Summaries & Evaluations| volume = suppl. 7 |page= 119| publisher = [[World Health Organization]]}}</ref>

Cases of [[hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma]] – a rare type of [[lymphoma]] – have been reported in patients treated with azathioprine. The majority occurred in patients with [[inflammatory bowel disease]]. Adolescents and young adult males were the majority of cases.<ref name="gut" /> They presented with a very aggressive disease course and, with one exception, died of the lymphoma. The FDA has required changes to the labeling to inform users and clinicians of the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm258794.htm |title=Imuran (azathioprine) Tablets and Injection |author= |date=May 2011 |work= |publisher=FDA |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref>

====Skin cancers====
In transplant patients, [[skin cancer]] is 50 to 250 times more common than in the general population, and between 60% and 90% of patients are affected 20 years after transplantation. The use of immunosuppressive medication including azathioprine in organ transplantation has been linked to increased rates of developing skin cancer.<ref name="bbcsb">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4248356.stm |title=Skin cancer alert for organ drug |author= |date=September 15, 2005 |work=[[BBC Online]] |publisher=[[BBC news]]  |accessdate=June 10, 2012}}</ref> Azathioprine causes the accumulation of [[6-thioguanine]] (6-TG) in patients' DNA, which might trigger cancer when the patient is later exposed to [[ultraviolet light]].

===Drug interactions===
Other purine analogues such as [[allopurinol]] inhibit [[xanthine oxidase]], the enzyme that breaks down azathioprine, thus increasing the toxicity of azathioprine.<ref name="pmid18506437" /> On the other hand, low doses of allopurinol have been shown to safely enhance the efficacy of azathioprine, especially in inflammatory bowel disease non-responders.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chocair P, Duley J, Simmonds HA, et al. |title=Low-dose allopurinol plus azathioprine/cyclosporin/prednisolone, a novel immunosuppressive regimen. |journal=Lancet |year=1993 |volume=342 |pages=83–84 |pmid= 8100914}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sparrow MP, Hande SA, Friedman S, et al. |title=Allopurinol safely and effectively optimizes tioguanine metabolites in inflammatory bowel disease patients not responding to azathioprine and mercaptopurine |journal= Aliment Pharmacol Ther |year=2005 |volume=22 |pages=441–6 |pmid= 16128682}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sparrow | first1 = M.

Azathioprine decreases the effects of the [[anticoagulant]] [[warfarin]] and of [[Non-depolarizing blocking agent|non-depolarizing]] muscle relaxants, but increases the effect of [[Depolarizing blocking agent|depolarizing]] muscle relaxants.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /> It can also interfere with [[niacin]] (vitamin B<sub>3</sub>), resulting in at least one case to [[pellagra]] and fatal medullary aplasia.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Oliveria A, Sanches M, Selores M |title=Azathioprine-induced pellagra |journal=J Dermatol |year=2011 |volume=38 |pages=1035–7 |pmid= 21658113}}</ref> It has also been reported to cause [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kim CJ, Park K, Inoue H, et al.  |title=Azathioprine-lnduced megaloblastic anemia with pancytopenia 22 years after living-related renal transplantation |journal=Int J Urol |year=1998 |volume=5 |pages=100–102 |pmid= 9535611}}</ref>

== Overdose ==
Large single doses are generally well tolerated; a patient who took 7.5&nbsp;g azathioprine (150 tablets) at once showed no relevant symptoms apart from vomiting, slightly decreased white blood cell count and marginal changes in liver function parameters. Main symptoms of long-term overdosing are infections of unclear origin, [[mouth ulcer]]s and spontaneous bleeding, all of which are consequences of the bone marrow suppression.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

Azathioprine is absorbed from the gut to about 88%. [[Bioavailability]] varies greatly between individual patients, between 30 and 90%, because the drug is partly inactivated in the liver. Highest blood plasma concentrations, counting not only the drug itself but also its metabolites, are reached after one to two hours; and the average plasma half-life is 26 to 80 minutes for azathioprine and three to five hours for drug plus metabolites. 20 to 30% are bound to [[plasma proteins]] while circulating in the bloodstream.<ref name="derma" /><ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor=Dinnendahl, V, Fricke, U|publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|year=2011|edition=25|volume=2|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref><ref name="Steinhilber">{{cite book|title=Medizinische Chemie|last1=Steinhilber|first1=D|last2=Schubert-Zsilavecz|first2=M|last3=Roth|first3=HJ|publisher=Deutscher Apotheker Verlag|location=Stuttgart|year=2005|page=340|isbn=3-7692-3483-9|language=German}}</ref>

Azathioprine is a [[prodrug]], a substance that is not an active drug itself but is activated in the body. This happens in several steps; at first it is slowly and almost completely converted to [[6-mercaptopurine]] (6-MP) by [[redox|reductive]] cleavage of the [[thioether]] (–[[sulfur|S]]–). This is mediated by [[glutathione]] and similar compounds in the intestinal wall, the liver and on red blood cells, without the aid of enzymes. 6-MP is metabolized analogously to natural purines, giving thio[[guanosine triphosphate]] (TGTP) and thio-[[deoxyguanosine triphosphate]] (TdGTP) via [[thioinosine monophosphate]] (TIMP) and several further intermediates. On a second path, the sulfur atom of 6-MP and TIMP is [[methyl]]ated. The end products of azathioprine metabolism are thio[[uric acid]] (38%) and various methylated and [[hydroxyl]]ated purines, which are excreted via the urine.<ref name="Mutschler" /><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /><ref name="Steinhilber" />

==Mechanism of action==
The purine molecule is the framework for two of the four bases that occur in DNA, [[adenine]] and [[guanine]]. Consequently, blocking the synthesis of purine also hinders DNA synthesis and thus inhibits the [[Cell growth|proliferation of cells]], especially fast-growing cells without a method of [[nucleotide salvage]] ("recycling"), such as [[lymphocytes]].<ref name=Example2006>{{Cite doi|10.1172/JCI18384}}</ref><ref name="Steinhilber" /> Two types of lymphocytes, T&nbsp;cells and B&nbsp;cells, are particularly affected by the inhibition of purine synthesis.<ref name="pmid18506437">{{Cite journal | last1 = Sahasranaman | first1 = S. | last2 = Howard | first2 = D. | last3 = Roy | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1007/s00228-008-0478-6 | title = Clinical pharmacology and pharmacogenetics of thiopurines | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 64 | issue = 8 | pages = 753–767 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18506437| pmc =}}</ref>

Azathioprine's active metabolite methyl-thioinosine monophosphate (MeTIMP) is a [[purine synthesis inhibitor]] that works by blocking the enzyme [[amidophosphoribosyltransferase]],<ref name="smpdb">{{cite web|url=http://pathman.smpdb.ca/pathways/SMP00427|title=Azathioprine Pathway|publisher=Small Molecule Pathway Database|accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref> possibly among others. Additional mechanisms, mediated by other metabolites, have been discovered several decades after the drug's introduction, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s:<ref name=Example2006 /> Thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP) is incorporated into [[RNA]], compromising its functionality. It also interacts with the [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]]-binding protein [[Rac1]], blocking upregulation of the protein [[Bcl-xL]] and thus sending activated T&nbsp;cells into [[apoptosis]] (a kind of programmed cell death). The closely related thio-deoxyguanosine triphosphate (TdGTP) is built into DNA.<ref name="Karran" /><ref name="smpdb" /> Thioinosinic acid impedes later steps of [[DNA replication|DNA synthesis]] via enzymes such as [[adenylosuccinate synthase]] and [[IMP dehydrogenase]]. Moreover, azathioprine blocks the downstream effects of [[CD28]] costimulation, a process required for T&nbsp;cell activation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cara | first1 = C.

==Physical and chemical properties==
Azathioprine is a [[thiopurine]] linked to a second [[heterocycle]] (an [[imidazole]] derivative) via a [[thioether]]. It is a pale yellow solid with a slightly bitter taste and a melting point of 238–245&nbsp;°C. It is practically insoluble in water and only slightly soluble in [[lipophilic]] solvents such as chloroform, ethanol and diethylether. It dissolves in alkaline aqueous solutions, where it [[hydrolyze]]s to 6-mercaptopurine.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

Azathioprine is synthesized from 5-chloro-1-methyl-4-nitro-1''H''-imidazole and 6-mercaptopurine in [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO).<ref>{{cite patent |country=US |number=3056785 |status=Patent |title = Purine Derivatives |gdate=1962-10-06 |fdate=1960-05-21 | invent1=G.

Azathioprine was synthesized by [[George Herbert Hitchings]] and [[Gertrude Elion]] in 1957 (named ''BW&nbsp;57-322'') to produce 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in a metabolically active but masked form, and at first used as a [[chemotherapy]] drug.<ref name="nobel" /><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Elion | first1 = G.
