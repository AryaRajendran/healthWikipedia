The '''cerebrum''', or '''telencephalon''', together with the [[diencephalon]], constitutes the [[prosencephalon]] during [[embryo|embryonic]] development. In humans, the cerebrum is the [[Neuroanatomy#Orientation in neuroanatomy|superior]]-most region of the [[vertebrate]] [[central nervous system]]. However, in the majority of animals, the cerebrum is the [[anterior]]-most region of the CNS as most animals rarely assume an upright [[anatomical position]]. Telencephalon refers to the embryonic structure from which the mature cerebrum develops. In mammals, the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] telencephalon, or [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallium]], develops into the [[cerebral cortex]], and the [[ventral]] telencephalon, or [[subpallium]], becomes the [[basal ganglia]]. The cerebrum is also divided into approximately symmetric [[Lateralization of brain function|left and right cerebral hemispheres.]]

With the assistance of the [[cerebellum]], the cerebrum controls all voluntary actions in the body.

== Development ==
During vertebrate embryonic development, the prosencephalon, the most anterior of three [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s that form from the embryonic [[neural tube]], is further subdivided into the telencephalon and diencephalon. The telencephalon then forms two lateral telencephalic vesicles which develop into the left and right cerebral hemispheres.

== Structure ==

[[File:Medial surface of cerebral cortex - entorhinal cortex.png|thumb|Medial surface of the cerebral hemispheres|250 px|left]]
The cerebrum is composed of the following sub-regions:
* [[Cerebral cortex]], or cortices of the cerebral hemispheres
* [[Basal ganglia]], or basal nuclei
* [[Limbic System]]

== Composition ==
[[File:Cerebrum animation small.gif|thumb|Location of the human cerebrum (red).]]
The cerebrum comprises a large portion of the [[brain]]. It lies in front or on top of the [[brainstem]] and in humans is the largest and best-developed of the five major divisions of the brain. The cerebrum is the newest structure in the [[phylogenetic]] sense, with [[mammal]]s having the largest and best-developed among all [[species]]. In larger mammals, the cerebral cortex is folded into many [[gyri]] (ridges) and [[sulcus (morphology)|sulci]] (furrows), which has allowed the cortex to expand in surface area without taking up much greater volume.

In [[human]]s, the cerebrum surrounds older parts of the brain. [[Limbic]], [[olfactory]], and [[motor systems]] project fibers from the cerebrum to the [[brainstem]] and [[spinal cord]]. [[Cognition|Cognitive]] and [[volition (psychology)|volitive]] systems project fibers from the cerebrum to the [[thalamus]] and to specific regions of the [[midbrain]]. The neural networks of the cerebrum facilitate complex behaviors such as social interactions, thought, judgement, learning, [[working memory]], and in humans, speech and [[language]].

== Functions ==
'''Note''': As the cerebrum is a gross division with many subdivisions and sub-regions, it is important to state that this section lists the functions that the cerebrum ''as a whole'' serves. See main articles on [[cerebral cortex]] and [[basal ganglia]] for more information.

=== Movement ===
The cerebrum directs the conscious or volitional motor functions of the body. These functions originate within the [[primary motor cortex]] and other frontal lobe motor areas where actions are planned. [[Upper motor neuron]]s in the primary motor cortex send their [[axon]]s to the brainstem and spinal cord to [[synapse]] on the [[lower motor neurons]], which innervate the muscles. Damage to motor areas of cortex can lead to certain types of [[motor neuron disease]]. This kind of damage results in loss of muscular power and precision rather than total [[paralysis]].

It functions as the center of sensory perception, memory, thoughts and judgement; also functions as the center of voluntary motor activity.

=== Sensory processing ===
The primary sensory areas of the [[cerebral cortex]] receive and process visual, auditory, [[somatosensory]], [[gustatory]], and [[olfactory]] information. Together with association cortical areas, these brain regions synthesize sensory information into our perceptions of the world around us.

=== Olfaction ===
{{Main|Olfaction}}
The [[olfactory bulb]] in most vertebrates is the most anterior portion of the cerebrum, and makes up a relatively large proportion of the telencephalon. However, in humans, this part of the brain is much smaller, and lies underneath the frontal lobe. The olfactory sensory system is unique in the sense that neurons in the olfactory bulb send their axons directly to the [[piriform cortex|olfactory cortex]], rather than to the [[thalamus]] first. Damage to the olfactory bulb results in a loss of the sense of smell.

=== Language and communication ===
{{Main|Language}}
[[Speech communication|Speech]] and language are mainly attributed to parts of the cerebral cortex. Motor portions of language are attributed to [[Broca's area]] within the frontal lobe. Speech comprehension is attributed to [[Wernicke's area]], at the temporal-parietal lobe junction. These two regions are interconnected by a large [[white matter]] tract, the [[arcuate fasciculus]]. Damage to the Broca's area results in [[expressive aphasia]] (non-fluent aphasia) while damage to Wernicke's area results in [[receptive aphasia]] (also called fluent aphasia).

=== Learning and memory ===
{{Main|Memory}}
Explicit or declarative (factual) memory formation is attributed to the [[hippocampus]] and associated regions of the medial temporal lobe. This association was originally described after a patient known as [[HM (patient)|HM]] had both his hippocampuses (left and right) surgically removed to treat severe epilepsy. After surgery, HM had [[anterograde amnesia]], or the inability to form new memories.

Implicit or procedural memory, such as complex motor behaviors, involves the basal ganglia.

Short-term or working memory involves association areas of the cortex, especially the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], as well as the hippocampus.

==Variation among species==
In the most primitive living vertebrates, the [[hagfish]]es and [[lamprey]]s, the cerebrum is a relatively simple structure receiving nerve impulses from the [[olfactory bulb]]. In [[cartilaginous]] and [[lobe-finned fish]]es, and also in [[amphibian]]s, a more complex structure is present, with the cerebrum being divided into three distinct regions. The lowermost (or ventral) region forms the basal nuclei, and contains fibres connecting the rest of the cerebrum to the [[thalamus]]. Above this, and forming the lateral part of the cerebrum, is the ''paleopallium'', while the uppermost (or dorsal) part is referred to as the ''archipallium''. The cerebrum remains largely devoted to olfactory sensation in these animals, despite its much wider range of functions in [[amniote]]s.<ref name="VB" />

In [[ray-finned fish]]es, the structure is somewhat different. The inner surfaces of the lateral and ventral regions of the cerebrum bulge up into the ventricles; these include both the basal nuclei and the various parts of the pallium, and may be complex in structure, especially in [[teleost]]s. The dorsal surface of the cerebrum is membranous, and does not contain any nervous tissue.<ref name="VB" />

In the amniotes, the cerebrum becomes increasingly large and complex. In [[reptile]]s, the paleopallium is much larger than in amphibians, and its growth has pushed the basal nuclei into the central regions of the cerebrum. As in the lower vertebrates, the grey matter is generally located beneath the white matter, but in some reptiles, it spreads out to the surface to form a primitive cortex, especially in the anterior part of the brain.<ref name="VB" />

In [[mammal]]s, this development proceeds further, so that the cortex covers almost the whole of the cerebral hemispheres, especially in more "advanced" species, such as [[primate]]s. The paleopallium is pushed to the ventral surface of the brain, where it becomes the olfactory lobes, while the archipallium becomes rolled over at the medial dorsal edge to form the [[hippocampus]]. In [[placental mammal]]s, a [[corpus callosum]] also develops, further connecting the two hemispheres. The complex convolutions of the cerebral surface are also found only in higher mammals.<ref name="VB" /> Although some large mammals (such as elephants) have particularly large cerebra, [[dolphins]] are the only species (other than humans) to have cerebra accounting for as much as 2 percent of their body weight.<ref>T.L. Brink. (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. "Unit 4: The Nervous System." pp 62[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TLBrink_PSYCH04.pdf]</ref>

The cerebrum of [[bird]]s has evolved along different lines to that of mammals, although they are similarly enlarged, by comparison with reptiles. However, this enlargement is largely due to the basal ganglia, with the other areas remaining relatively primitive in structure. For example, there is no great expansion of the cerebral cortex, as there is in mammals. Instead, an [[High vocal center|HVC]] develops just above the basal ganglia, and this appears to be the area of the bird brain most concerned with learning complex tasks.<ref name="VB">{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 536–543|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>
