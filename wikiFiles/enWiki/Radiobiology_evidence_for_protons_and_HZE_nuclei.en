Sufficient proof that experimental models represent cancer processes in humans, including estimating the effectiveness of shielding and biological countermeasures, must be obtained from these high-risk missions where acceptable levels of cancer risks are approached or, perhaps, exceeded.

==Cancer Induction by Space Radiation==
A necessary step for improving space radiation cancer risk assessment is to perform studies on the molecular pathways that are causative of cancer initiation and progression, and to extend these studies to learn how such pathways can be disrupted by HZE ions, including both genetic and epigenetic modifications that are noted as the hallmarks of cancer (Figure 4-8).  The goal of this research is to establish a more mechanistic approach to estimating risk and to answer questions, including whether HZE effects can be scaled from those of gamma rays, whether risk is linear with low dose-rate, and how individual radiation sensitivity impacts the risks for astronauts, a population that is selected for many factors related to excellence in health.

==The Initial Biological Events==
Energy deposition by HZE ions is highly heterogeneous with a localized contribution along the trajectory of each particle and lateral diffusion of energetic electrons (delta rays) that are many microns from the ions path.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09553009414550021 |title=Initial Events in the Cellular Effects of Ionizing Radiations: Clustered Damage in DNA |year=1994 |last1=Goodhead |first1=D.T. |journal=International Journal of Radiation Biology |volume=65 |pages=7–17 |pmid=7905912 |issue=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1350-4487(99)00273-5 |title=Analysis of MIR-18 results for physical and biological dosimetry: Radiation shielding effectiveness in LEO |year=2000 |last1=Cucinotta |first1=F.A |last2=Wilson |first2=J.W |last3=Williams |first3=J.R |last4=Dicello |first4=J.F |journal=Radiation Measurements |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=181–91 |pmid=11543368}}</ref>  These particles are, therefore, characterized by a high-LET, however, they contain a low-LET component fur to high-energy electrons that are ejected by ions as they traverse tissue.  Biophysical models have shown that the energy deposition events by high-LET radiation produce differential DNA lesions, including complex DNA breaks, and that there are qualitative differences between high- and low-LET radiation, in both the induction and the repair of DNA damage.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/095530098141564 |title=A review of dsb induction data for varying quality radiations |year=1998 |last1=Prise |first1=K.

Complex damage is uncommon for endogenous damage or low-LET radiation, and has been associated with the increased RBE of densely ionizing radiation.  The repair of DSB is known to occur through direct end-joining and homologous recombination processes.  Indications are that:
* for high-LET radiation, where complex DSBs occur with high frequency, little repair occurs, leading to cell death
or
* the mis-rejoining of unrepairable ends with other radiation-induced DSB leads to large DNA deletions and chromosome aberrations.

While the high effectiveness in cell killing provides the rationale for heavy-ion cancer therapy (hadrontherapy), residual damage in surviving cells is of concern for carcinogenesis.

===Chromosome damage and mutation===
Heavy charged particles are very effective at producing chromosomal exchanges with RBE values exceeding 30 in interphase (as visualized using premature chromosome condensation) and 10 at the post-irradiation mitosis for energetic Fe-ions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1667/RR3064 |title=Biological Effectiveness of Accelerated Particles for the Induction of Chromosome Damage Measured in Metaphase and Interphase Human Lymphocytes |year=2003 |last1=George |first1=Kerry |last2=Durante |first2=Marco |last3=Willingham |first3=Veronica |last4=Wu |first4=Honglu |last5=Yang |first5=Tracy C. |last6=Cucinotta |first6=Francis A. |journal=Radiation Research |volume=160 |issue=4 |pages=425–35 |pmid=12968931}}</ref>  The detailed RBE vs. LET relationship that was found for total exchanges is similar to that of earlier studies of mutation<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0273-1177(94)90475-8 |title=Mutation induction by heavy ions |year=1994 |last1=Kiefer |first1=J. |last2=Stoll |first2=U. |last3=Schneider |first3=E. |journal=Advances in Space Research |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=257–65 |pmid=11539959|bibcode = 1994AdSpR..14..257K }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12793725 |year=2002 |last1=Kiefer |first1=J |title=Mutagenic effects of heavy charged particles |volume=43 Suppl |pages=S21–5 |journal=Journal of radiation research}}</ref> and in vitro neoplastic transformation.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3583525}}</ref>  For all of these endpoints, RBE peaks at around 100 to 200 keV/μm before it decreases at very high-LET.  However, the quality of chromosome damage is different when heavy ions are compared to sparsely ionizing radiation.

So-called bystander or non-targeted effects may have enormous consequences for space exploration.  Non-targeted effects may lead to a supra-linear dose-response curve at low doses, perhaps reducing the effectiveness of spacecraft shielding; but it may also provide protection by removing damaged cells from the organism.  Both effects challenge the conventional linear no-threshold risk model assumption, which is currently adopted for radioprotection on Earth and in space.  These effects also suggest important targets for biological countermeasures that are likely to be more effective than are countermeasures that target DNA damage.

Results in tissues suggest that differences in biological response between high- and low-LET differ depending on the model context that is considered (i.e., 2D vs. 3D vs. animal).  As a result of the many types of particles, energies, and doses of interest that are in space, extensive animal experimentation has been prohibited by costs in the past.  More recently, however, studies in 3D human coculture are proving to be an effective method with which to study cancer risks in a more realistic context.<ref name=Barcellos-Hoff /><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2004.10.029 |title=A Pathway of Double-Strand Break Rejoining Dependent upon ATM, Artemis, and Proteins Locating to γ-H2AX Foci |year=2004 |last1=Riballo |first1=Enriqueta |last2=Kühne |first2=Martin |last3=Rief |first3=Nicole |last4=Doherty |first4=Aidan |last5=Smith |first5=Graeme C.M. |last6=Recio |first6=Marı́a-José |last7=Reis |first7=Caroline |last8=Dahm |first8=Kirsten |last9=Fricke |first9=Andreas |journal=Molecular Cell |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=715–24 |pmid=15574327}}</ref>
