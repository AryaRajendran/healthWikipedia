The [[English language|English]] suffixes '''-phobia''', '''-phobic''', '''-phobe''' (''of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin: φόβος/φοβία'' ) occur in technical usage in [[psychiatry]] to construct words that describe irrational, disabling [[fear]] as a mental disorder (e.g. [[agoraphobia]]), in [[chemistry]] to describe chemical aversions (e.g. [[hydrophobic]]), in [[biology]] to describe organisms that dislike certain conditions (e.g. [[acidophobia]]), and in [[medicine]] to describe hypersensitivity to a stimulus, usually sensory (e.g. [[photophobia]]). In common usage they also form words that describe dislike or hatred of a particular thing or subject. The suffix is [[antonym]]ic to [[-phil-]].

For more information on the psychiatric side, including how psychiatry groups phobias such as agoraphobia, social phobia, or simple phobia, see [[phobia]]. The following lists include words ending in ''-phobia'', and include fears that have acquired names. In some cases, the naming of phobias has become a [[word game]], of notable example being a 1998 humorous article published by ''[[BBC News]]''.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/entertainment/173250.stm The A- Z of Fear], an October 30, 1998 ''[[BBC News]]'' unsigned article in the "Entertainment" section</ref> In some cases a word ending in ''-phobia'' may have an [[antonym]] with the suffix ''[[-phil-]]'', e.g. [[Anti-German sentiment|Germanophobe]] / [[Germanophile]].

A large number of ''-phobia'' lists circulate on the Internet, with words collected from indiscriminate sources, often copying each other. Also, a number of psychiatric websites exist that at the first glance cover a huge number of phobias, but in fact use a standard text to fit any phobia and reuse it for all unusual phobias by merely changing the name. Sometimes it leads to bizarre results, such as suggestions to cure "prostitute phobia".<ref>[http://www.webpronews.com/insidesearch/insidesearch/wpn-56-20050825ContentSpammersHelpYouOvercomeProstitutePhobia.html Content Spammers Help You Overcome Prostitute Phobia]</ref> Such practice is known as [[content spamming]] and is used to attract [[Web search engine|search engine]]s.{{OR|date=December 2010}}

==Psychological conditions==
In many cases specialists prefer to avoid the suffix ''-phobia'' and use more descriptive terms, see, e.g. [[personality disorder]]s, [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[avoidant personality disorder]], [[love-shyness]].
