'''Defensins''' are small Cysteine-rich [[cationic]] [[proteins]] found in both [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s. They have also been reported in plants.<ref>[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2008.08.019 Structure–activity studies of AtPep1, a plant peptide signal involved in the innate immune response] Peptides Volume 29, Issue 12, December 2008, Pages 2083-2089</ref><ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12447532 Planta. 2002 Dec;216(2):193-202. Epub 2002 Oct 8. Plant defensins.]</ref> They are, and function as, [[host defense peptides]]. They are active against [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]] and many enveloped and nonenveloped [[viruses]]. They consist of 18-45 [[amino acid]]s including six (in vertebrates) to eight conserved [[cysteine]] residues. Cells of the [[immune system]] contain these peptides to assist in killing [[Phagocyte|phagocytosed]] bacteria, for example in [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s and almost all [[epithelial cells]]. Most defensins function by binding to the [[microbial]] [[cell membrane]], and, once embedded, forming pore-like membrane defects that allow [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] of essential ions and nutrients.

==Varieties==
The underlying genes responsible for defensin production are highly [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]]. Some aspects are conserved, however; the hallmarks of a β-defensin are its small size, high density of cationic charge, and six-cysteine-residue motif. In general, they are encoded by two-[[exon]] genes, wherein the first exon encodes for a hydrophobic leader sequence and the second for a peptide containing the cysteine motif.

==Function==
In immature [[marsupials]], because their [[immune system]] is underdeveloped at the time of birth, defensins play a major role in defense against [[pathogens]]. They are produced in the milk of the mother as well as by the young marsupial in question. 

Human genome contains theta-defensin genes, but they have a premature [[stop codon]], hampering their expression. An artificial human theta-defensin,<ref>{{MeshName|retrocyclin}}</ref> '''retrocyclin''', was created by `fixing' the [[pseudogene]], and it was shown to be effective against [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]]<!--

--> and other viruses, including [[herpes simplex virus]] and [[influenza A]]. They act primarily by preventing these viruses from entering their target cells. 

Also interesting is the effect of alpha-defensins on the [[exotoxin]] produced by anthrax (''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''). Chun Kim et al. showed how anthrax, which produces a [[metalloprotease]] Lethal Factor (LF) protein to target [[MAPKK]], is vulnerable to human neutrophil protein-1 (HNP-1). This group showed HNP-1 to behave as a reversible noncompetitive inhibitor of LF.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kim C, Gajendran N, Mittrücker H, Weiwad M, Song Y, Hurwitz R, Wilmanns M, Fischer G, Kaufmann S | title = Human alpha-defensins neutralize anthrax lethal toxin and protect against its fatal consequences | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 102 | issue = 13 | pages = 4830–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15772169 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0500508102 | pmc = 555714}}</ref>

Defensin-like proteins are also a component of [[platypus]] venom.

===Defensin-mimetics as antibiotics===
Similar molecules (e.g. [[PMX-30063]]) are being developed as [[antibiotic]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/118978.php |title=PMX-30063 The First And Only Defensin Mimetic Systemic Antibiotic Drug In Human Clinical Trials |year=2008 }}</ref>

==Pathology==

The [[alpha defensin]] peptides are increased in chronic inflammatory conditions.

[[Alpha defensin]] are increased in several cancers, including colorectal cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Albrethsen J | last2 = Bøgebo | first2 = R | last3 = Gammeltoft | first3 = S | last4 = Olsen | first4 = J | last5 = Winther | first5 = B | last6 = Raskov | first6 = H | title = Upregulated expression of human neutrophil peptides 1, 2 and 3 (HNP 1-3) in colon cancer serum and tumours: a biomarker study | journal = BMC cancer | volume = 5 | pages = 9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15656915 | pmc = 548152 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/5/8}}</ref>

A reduction of [[ileum|ileal]] defensins may predispose to [[Crohn's disease]].<ref>Genomics & Genetics Weekly, "Researchers discover a possible cause of chronic inflammations of Crohn Disease."

In one small study, a significant increase in [[alpha defensin]] levels was detected in [[T cell]] lysates of [[schizophrenia]] patients; in discordant twin pairs, unaffected twins also had an increase, although not as high as that of their ill siblings. The authors suggested that alpha-defensin levels might prove a useful marker for schizophrenia risk.<!--
