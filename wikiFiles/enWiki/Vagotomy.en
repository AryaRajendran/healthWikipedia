A '''vagotomy''' is a [[surgery|surgical]] procedure that involves [[Segmental resection|resection]] of the [[vagus nerve]].

See ''Types'' below for types/variations of vagotomy.

==Applications==
Truncal vagotomy is a treatment option for chronic [[peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcers]].<ref>{{cite journal

Vagotomy was a way to reduce the acidity of the stomach, by denervating the parietal cells that produce acid. This was done with the hope that it would treat or prevent peptic ulcers. It also had the effect of reducing or eliminating symptoms of [[gastroesophageal reflux]] in those who suffered from it. The incidence of vagotomy decreased following the discovery by [[Barry Marshall]] and [[Robin Warren]] that ''[[Helicobacter pylori|H. pylori]]'' is responsible for most peptic ulcers, because ''H. pylori'' can be treated much less invasively. One potential side effect of vagotomy is a [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] deficiency. As vagotomy decreases gastric secretion, [[intrinsic factor]] production can be impaired. Intrinsic factor is needed to absorb vitamin B<sub>12</sub> efficiently from food, and injections or large oral doses of the vitamin may be required after such a procedure in certain populations.<ref>http://www.pernicious-anaemia-society.org</ref>

==Types==
A plain vagotomy eliminates the [[parasympathetic]] supply from the stomach to the left side of the [[transverse colon]]. 

Other techniques focus on branches leading from the retroperitoneum to the stomach.<ref name="pmid8092897">{{cite journal |author=Jordan PH, Thornby J |title=Twenty years after parietal cell vagotomy or selective vagotomy antrectomy for treatment of duodenal ulcer. Final report |journal=Ann. Surg. |volume=220 |issue=3 |pages=283–93; discussion 293–6 |year=1994 |month=September |pmid=8092897 |doi= 10.1097/00000658-199409000-00005|url= |pmc=1234380}}</ref>

'''Highly selective vagotomy''' refers to denervation of only those branches supplying the lower esophagus and stomach (leaving the [[nerve of Latarjet]] in place in order to ensure the emptying function of the stomach remains intact). It is one of the treatments of peptic ulcer.
