The '''fascia lata''' is the [[deep fascia]] of the [[thigh]].

==Thickness==
It is an investment for the whole of the thigh, but varies in thickness in different parts.

Thus, it is thicker in the upper and lateral part of the thigh, where it receives a fibrous expansion from the [[Gluteus maximus]], and where the [[Tensor fasciae latae]] is inserted between its layers; it is very thin behind and at the upper and medial part, where it covers the [[Adductor muscles]], and again becomes stronger around the knee, receiving fibrous expansions from the tendon of the [[Biceps femoris]] laterally, from the [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]] medially, and from the [[Quadriceps femoris]] in front.

==Above and behind==
The fascia lata is attached, above and behind, to the back of the [[sacrum]] and [[coccyx]]; laterally, to the [[iliac crest]]; in front, to the [[inguinal ligament]], and to the [[superior pubic ramus|superior ramus]] of the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]]; and medially, to the [[inferior pubic ramus|inferior ramus]] of the pubis, to the inferior ramus and tuberosity of the [[ischium]], and to the lower border of the [[sacrotuberous ligament]]. 

From its attachment to the iliac crest it passes down over the [[Gluteus medius]] to the upper border of the [[Gluteus maximus]], where it splits into two layers, one passing superficial to and the other beneath this muscle; at the lower border of the muscle the two layers reunite.

==Laterally==
Laterally, the fascia lata receives the greater part of the tendon of insertion of the Gluteus maximus, and becomes proportionately thickened. 

The portion of the fascia lata attached to the front part of the iliac crest, and corresponding to the origin of the Tensor fasciae latae, extends down the lateral side of the thigh as two layers, one superficial to and the other beneath this muscle; at the lower end of the muscle these two layers unite and form a strong band, having first received the insertion of the muscle.

This band is continued downward, under the name of the [[iliotibial band]] (tractus iliotibialis) and is attached to the lateral condyle of the [[tibia]]. 

The part of the iliotibial band which lies beneath the [[Tensor fasciae latae]] is prolonged upward to join the lateral part of the capsule of the [[hip-joint]].

==Below==
Below, the fascia lata is attached to all the prominent points around the [[knee-joint]], viz., the [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]]s of the femur and tibia, and the [[head of the fibula]]. 

On either side of the [[patella]] it is strengthened by transverse fibers from the lower parts of the Vasti, which are attached to and support this bone. 

Of these the lateral are the stronger, and are continuous with the iliotibial band. 

The deep surface of the fascia lata gives off two strong [[intermuscular septa (disambiguation)|intermuscular septa]], which are attached to the whole length of the linea aspera and its prolongations above and below; the lateral and stronger one, which extends from the insertion of the [[Gluteus maximus]] to the [[lateral condyle (disambiguation)|lateral condyle]], separates the [[Vastus lateralis]] in front from the short head of the [[Biceps femoris]] behind, and gives partial origin to these muscles; the medial and thinner one separates the [[Vastus medialis]] from the [[Adductores (disambiguation)|Adductores]] and [[Pectineus]]. 

Besides these there are numerous smaller septa, separating the individual muscles, and enclosing each in a distinct sheath.

===Crural fascia===
The [[crural fascia]] is a continuation of the fascia lata.<ref>[http://anatomy.med.umich.edu/limbs/leg_ans.html Anatomy.med]</ref>

==Transplantation==
Since the 1920s fascia latas from deceased donors have been used in reconstructive surgery. In 1999 preserved mashed fascia latas became FDA-approved as  a tissue product designed to replace areas of lost fascia or collagen.<ref name="pmid10594581">{{cite journal |author=Burres S |title=Preserved particulate fascia lata for injection: a new alternative |journal=Dermatol Surg |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=790â€“4 |year=1999 |month=October |pmid=10594581 |doi= |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1076-0512&date=1999&volume=25&issue=10&spage=790}}</ref>

==Etymology==
It is named from its great extent. "Latus" give the superlative "Latissimus" meaning broadest or widest.<ref>[Lexicon of Orthopaedic Etymology, Google books]</ref>
