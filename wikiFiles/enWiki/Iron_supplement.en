'''Iron supplements''' are [[dietary supplements]] containing [[iron]] that can be prescribed by a doctor for a medical reason, or purchased from a vitamin shop, drug store etc. They are primarily used to treat [[anemia]] or other [[I (medicine)|iron deficiencies]]. There are three ways that an an be delivered: orally, intravenously or intramuscularly. 

The first '''iron pills''' were commonly known as '''Blaud's pills''',<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/blaud's%20pill Blaud's pill – Medical Definition and More from]. Merriam-Webster. Retrieved on 2012-12-21.</ref> which were named after [[P. Blaud of Beaucaire]], the French physician who introduced and started the use of these medications as a treatment for patients with [[anemia]].<ref name=TMHP>{{cite-TMHP|''P. Blaud of Beaucaire'', ''Blaud's Pills for Anemia'', ''Iron pills'', ''Iron''}}, p. 435.</ref>

==Indications==
Iron supplements are used in [[medicine]] to treat [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]] and iron-deficiency [[anemia]];<ref name="medicines.org.uk">[http://www.medicines.org.uk/EMC/medicine/24167/SPC/Ferinject+(ferric+carboxymaltose)/ Ferinject (ferric n 2012-12-21.</ref> parenteral irons can also be used to treat functional iron deficiency, where requirements for iron are greater than the body's ability to supply iron such as in inflammatory states. The main criteria is that other causes of anemia have been ruled out, such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub>/[[folate]] deficiency, drug induced or due to other poisons such as lead. Iron deficiency anemia is microcytic, hypochromic anemia. Generally, oral preparations are trialled before using parenteral delivery.<ref>Goddard AF, James MW , McIntyre AS and Scott BB (May 2005). [http://www.bsg.org.uk/pdf_word_docs/iron_def.pdf Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia]. British Society of Gastroenterology</ref> 

There are three main causes of iron deficiency anemia:
* dietary: too little present or difficult to absorb
* increased requirements: (body failing to utilize iron stores adequately, if [[diabetes]] is ruled out)
* increased losses: for many women its causes include chronic blood loss from the [[GI tract]] as well as heavy menstruation as well as acute loss from trauma).

Often the presentation is a mixed picture with several concurrent factors, such as cases of [[irritable bowel disease]]s with chronic loss, reduced oral absorption due to [[inflammation]] leading due to increased [[hepcidin]] levels and reduced amount in diet due to poor appetite. Preventive measures must be discussed with the patient (for example when the patient is on a [[Vegetarian nutrition#Iron|strict vegetarian diet]] because inorganic iron in plants has a lower [[bioavailability]], or elderly patients with a poor diet).

==Administration==

===Oral===
Iron can be supplemented by the [[oral route]] using various pharmacological forms, such as [[iron(II) sulfate]] (this is the most common and cheapest [[salt]], e.g. Feratab, Fer-Iron, Slow-FE,…) and in complex with [[gluconate]], [[dextran]], [[carbonyl iron]], and other salts. Sometimes [[ascorbic acid]] is added for better absorption.

Heme iron polypeptide (HIP) (e.g. Proferrin ES and Proferrin Forte) can be used when regular iron supplements such as ferrous sulfate or ferrous fumarate are not tolerated or absorbed. A clinical study demonstrated that HIP increased serum iron levels 23 times greater than ferrous fumarate on a milligram-per-milligram basis.<ref>Seligman, et al., Nutritional Research 2000; Vol. 20, No 9:1279–1286.</ref> 

Another alternative is ''ferrous [[glycine]] [[sulfate]]'' or ''ferroglycine sulfate'', has less gastrointestinal side-effects than standard preparations such as iron fumarate.<ref>{{cite pmid|7146040}}</ref> It is unusual among oral preparations of iron supplements in that the iron in this preparation has very high oral bio-availability esp in the liquid version (e.g. Hemfer by Alkem). This option should be evaluated before resorting to parenteral therapy. It is especially useful in iron deficiency anemia associated with [[autoimmune gastritis]] and ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' gastritis, where it generally has satisfactory effect.<ref>{{cite pmid|17426393}}</ref>

Since iron stores in the body are generally depleted, and there is a limit to what the body can process (about 2–6&nbsp;mg/kg of body mass per day; i.e. for a 100&nbsp;kg/220&nbsp;lb man this is equal to a maximum dose of 200–600&nbsp;mg/per day) without [[iron poisoning]], this is a chronic therapy which may take 3–6 months.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/iron-poisoning Iron Poisoning]. Webmd.com (2012-09-27). Retrieved on 2012-12-21.</ref>

Due to the frequent intolerance of oral iron and the slow improvement, parenteral iron is recommended in many indications.<ref>[http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG114 Anaemia management in people with chronic kidney disease]. Guidance.nice.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-12-21.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://chinesefms.com/doc/zhw/doc_zhw_xzzn/201104/P020110416418498436822.pdf |pmid=21464096|year=2011|last1=Mowat|first1=C|last2=Cole|first2=A|last3=Windsor|first3=A|last4=Ahmad|first4=T|last5=Arnott|first5=I|last6=Driscoll|first6=R|last7=Mitton|first7=S|last8=Orchard|first8=T|last9=Rutter|first9=M|title=Guidelines for the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults|volume=60|issue=5|pages=571–607|doi=10.1136/gut.2010.224154|journal=Gut}}</ref>

===Parenteral===
[[Parenteral]] iron therapy (intravenously or intramuscular) is given when oral therapy has failed (not tolerated by the patient), oral absorption is seriously compromised (by illnesses, or when the patient cannot swallow), benefit from oral therapy cannot be expected or fast improvement is required (for example, prior to elective surgery). Parenteral therapy is more expensive than oral iron preparations and most preparations are not suitable during the first trimester of [[pregnancy]], although Ferinject can be used.<ref>[http://www.medicines.org.uk/EMC/medicine/24167/SPC/Ferinject+(ferric+carboxymaltose)/#PREGNANCY Ferinject (ferric carboxymaltose) – Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) – (eMC)]. Medicines.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-12-21.</ref> 

There are cases where parenteral iron is preferable over oral iron. These are cases where oral iron is not tolerated, where the [[haemoglobin]] needs to be increased quickly (e.g. post partum, post operatively, post transfusion), where there is an underlying inflammatory condition (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease) or renal patients, the benefits of parenteral iron far outweigh the risks. In many cases, use of intravenous iron has lower risks of adverse events than a blood transfusion and as long as the patient is stable is a better alternative.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1471-2326-11-4|title=Meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject) from clinical trial reports and published trial data|year=2011|last1=Moore|first1=R Andrew|last2=Gaskell|first2=Helen|last3=Rose|first3=Peter|last4=Allan|first4=Jonathan|journal=BMC Blood Disorders|volume=11|pages=4|pmid=21942989|pmc=3206450}}</ref> Ultimately this always remains a clinical decision based on local guidelines, although National Guidelines are increasingly stipulating IV iron in certain groups of patients.

Soluble Iron salts have a significant risk of adverse effects and can cause toxicity due to damage to cellular macromolecules. Delivering iron parenterally has utilised various different molecules to limit this. This has included [[dextrans]], [[sucrose]] and [[carboxymaltose]].

One formulation of parenteral iron is ''iron dextran'' (trade names including ''Cosmofer'', ''DexFerrum'', ''Infed''). A notable side effect is [[allergic reaction]], which occurs in less than 1 on 100 treated patients,<ref>[http://www.fass.se/LIF/produktfakta/artikel_produkt.jsp?NplID=20060226000011&DocTypeID=7 Cosmofer] in [[FASS (drug formulary)]], translated from Swedish "Allergiska reaktioner (förekommer hos færre än 1 av 100 behandlade patienter) "</ref> but may cause severe, sometimes fatal, complications, including loss of consciousness, collapse, difficulty breathing, hives, swelling, convulsions and severe low blood pressure ([[hypotension]]).<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/mtm/iron-dextran.html Drugs.com > iron dextran] Version: 1.05. Revision Date: 12/15/2010</ref>

''Iron [[sucrose]]'' (trade names including ''Venofer'') has an occurrence of allergic reactions of less than 1 in 1000.<ref name=fass-venofer>[http://www.fass.se/LIF/produktfakta/artikel_produkt.jsp?NplID=20000211000213&DocTypeID=7 Venofer] in [[FASS (drug formulary)]], translated from Swedish "Allergiska reaktioner (inträffar hos färre än 1 av 1 000 patienter)" and "Vanliga (inträffar hos färre än 1 av 10 patienter): Tillfälliga smakförändringar (speciellt metallsmak)."</ref> A common side effect is [[taste change]]s, especially a [[metallic taste]], occurring in between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 treated patients.<ref name=fass-venofer/> It has a maximum dose of 200&nbsp;mg on each occasion according to the SPC, but it has been given in doses of 500&nbsp;mg. Doses can be given up to 3 times a week.

''Iron [[carboxymaltose]]'' (trade name ''Ferinject'') is a newer formulation of parenteral iron which is dextran free with the shell being fully metabolised in the body to simple sugars. The most common side effect are [[headaches]] which occur in 3.3%.<ref>[http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/24167/SPC#UNDESIRABLE_EFFECTS Ferinject (ferric carboxymaltose) – Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) – (eMC)]. Medicines.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-12-21.</ref> It can be given over 15 minutes in doses up to 1,000&nbsp;mg and has been adopted in many hospitals due to the increased number of patients that can be treated as no test dose is required and the patient does not need to be monitored after a dose has been administered.

==Side effects==
Side effects of therapy with oral iron are most often [[diarrhea]] or [[constipation]] and [[epigastric]] abdominal discomfort. Taken after a meal, side effects decrease, but there is an increased risk of interaction with other substances. Side effects are [[dose-dependent]], and the dose may be adjusted.

The patient may notice that his/her stools become black. This is completely harmless, but patients must be warned about this to avoid unnecessary concern. When iron supplements are given in a liquid form, teeth may reversibly discolor (this can be avoided through the use of a straw). Intramuscular injection can be painful, and brown discoloration may be noticed.

Treatments with [[iron(II) sulfate]] have higher incidence of adverse events than iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex (IPC)<ref name="pmid17691594">{{cite journal |author=Geisser P |title=Safety and efficacy of iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex / a review of over 25 years experience |journal=Arzneimittelforschung |volume=57 |issue=6A |pages=439–52 |year=2007 |pmid=17691594 |doi=10.1055/s-0031-1296693}}</ref><ref name="pmid17691593">{{cite journal |author=Toblli JE, Brignoli R |title=Iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex in iron deficiency anemia / review and meta-analysis |journal=Arzneimittelforschung |volume=57 |issue=6A |pages=431–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17691593 |doi=10.1055/s-0031-1296692}}</ref><ref name="pmid17435611">{{cite journal |author=Saha L, Pandhi P, Gopalan S, Malhotra S, Saha PK |title=Comparison of efficacy, tolerability, and cost of iron polymaltose complex with ferrous sulfate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women |journal=MedGenMed |volume=9 |issue=1 |page=1 |year=2007 |pmid=17435611 |pmc=1924983}}</ref> or iron bis-glycinate chelate.<ref name="pmid11688081">{{cite journal |author=Szarfarc SC, de Cassana LM, Fujimori E, Guerra-Shinohara EM, de Oliveira IM |title=Relative effectiveness of iron bis-glycinate chelate (Ferrochel) and ferrous sulfate in the control of iron deficiency in pregnant women |journal=Arch Latinoam Nutr |volume=51 |issue=1 Suppl 1 |pages=42–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11688081}}</ref><ref name="pmid11688084">{{cite journal |author=Ashmead SD |title=The chemistry of ferrous bis-glycinate chelate |journal=Arch Latinoam Nutr |volume=51 |issue=1 Suppl 1 |pages=7–12 |year=2001 |pmid=11688084}}</ref>

==Contraindications==

Contraindications often depend on the substance in question. Documented [[hypersensitivity]] to any ingredients and anemias without proper work-up (i.e., documentation of iron deficiency) is true of all preparations. Some can be used in iron deficiency, others require iron deficiency anaemia to be present. Some are also contraindicated in rheumatoid arthritis<ref>[http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/14139 CosmoFer – Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) – (eMC)]. Medicines.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-12-21.</ref>

=== Iron supplementation and infection risk ===
Because one of the functions of elevated [[ferritin]] (an acute phase reaction protein) in acute infections is thought to be to sequester iron from bacteria, it is generally thought that iron supplementation (which circumvents this mechanism) should be avoided in patients who have active bacterial infections. Replacement of iron stores is seldom such an emergency situation that it cannot wait for any such acute infection to be treated.

Some studies have found that iron supplementation can lead to an increase in [[infectious disease]] morbidity in areas where bacterial infections are common. For example, children receiving iron-enriched foods have demonstrated an increased rate in [[diarrhea]] overall and enteropathogen shedding. Iron deficiency protects against infection by creating an unfavorable environment for bacterial growth. Nevertheless, while iron deficiency might lessen infections by certain pathogenic diseases, it also leads to a reduction in resistance to other strains of viral or bacterial infections, such as ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' or ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''. Overall, it is sometimes difficult to decide whether iron supplementation will be beneficial or harmful to an individual in an environment that is prone to many infectious diseases; however this is a different question than the question of supplementation in individuals who are already ill with a bacterial infection.

==Interactions==
Non-[[heme]] iron forms an insoluble complex with several other drugs, resulting in decreased absorption of both iron and the other drug. Examples include [[tetracycline]], [[penicillamine]], [[methyldopa]], [[levodopa]], [[bisphosphonates]] and [[quinolones]]. The same can occur with elements in food, such as [[calcium]]. Absorption of iron is better at a low pH (an acid environment), and resorption is decreased if there is a simultaneous intake of antacids.

Many factors decrease the rates of non-heme iron. Examples are [[tannins]] from foods, such as [[tea]] and [[saw palmetto]], phytic acid and roughage.<ref>[http://www.parentingscience.com/iron-absorption.html Boosting iron absorption: A guide to for the science-minded]. Parentingscience.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-21.</ref> Vegetarians and especially vegans are at increased risk of [[iron deficiency]] due to the combination of limited amounts of iron in the diet in a form that is poorly absorbed alongside compounds that further limit absorption.

Taken after a meal, there are fewer side effects but there is also less absorption because of interaction and pH alteration. Generally, an interval of 2–3 hours between the iron intake and that of other drugs seems advisable, but is less convenient for patients and can impact on compliance.

==Precautions==

Iron overdose has been one of the leading causes of death caused by toxicological agents in children younger than 6 years<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/815213-overview Iron Toxicity in Emergency Medicine]. Emedicine.medscape.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-21.</ref> Children who ingest tablets may become intoxicated, in which case they should be taken to an emergency department. Some formulations (like carbonyl-iron) may be safer.

Acute overdose can be fatal to both children and adults and can occur by both the oral and parenteral route. Methods for preventing toxicity utilize [[gastric lavage]] and [[chelating agent]]s (e.g. intravenous desferrioxamine) which help remove the toxicity of free elemental iron which can catalyse redox reactions, leading to the production of hydroxide radicals.

It acts on the mucosal tissues and manifests as [[hematemesis]] and [[diarrhea]]; patients may become [[hypovolemic]] because of fluid and blood loss. 

;Cellular toxicity
The absorption of excessive quantities of ingested iron results in systemic iron toxicity. Severe overdose causes impaired oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction, which can result in cellular death. The liver is one of the organs most affected by iron toxicity, but other organs such as the heart, kidneys, lungs, and the hematologic systems also may be impaired. Individuals demonstrate signs of GI toxicity with ingestions of more than 20&nbsp;mg/kg, but less than or equal to 40&nbsp;mg/kg.

;Mortality/morbidity 
Iron poisoning may result in mortality or short-term and long-term morbidity.<ref>[http://www.tripdatabase.com/doc/813847-Toxicity-Iron-Overview#content Toxicity, Iron (Overview)]. Tripdatabase.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-21.</ref>

==Follow-up==
Follow-up is needed to ensure compliance and to detect adequate response to therapy. The interval of follow up can widely depend on both the method of administration, and the underlying pathology. For parenteral irons it is recommended that there be a period of 4 weeks before repeating blood test to allow the body to utilise the iron.<ref name="medicines.org.uk"/> For oral iron, this can take considerably longer, so waiting 3 months may be appropriate.
