'''Herpes simplex''' ({{lang-grc-gre|ἕρπης}} ''herpēs'', "creeping" or "latent") is a [[viral disease]] from the ''[[herpesviridae]]'' family caused by both [[Herpes simplex virus]] type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). Infection with the herpes virus is categorized into one of several distinct disorders based on the site of infection. [[Herpes labialis|Oral herpes]], the visible symptoms of which are colloquially called ''cold sores'' or ''fever blisters'', is an infection of the face or mouth. Oral herpes is the most common form of infection. [[Herpes genitalis|Genital herpes]], known simply as ''herpes'', is the second most common form of herpes. Other disorders such as [[herpetic whitlow]], [[herpes gladiatorum]], [[Herpes of the eye|ocular herpes]], cerebral herpes infection [[encephalitis]], [[Mollaret's meningitis]], [[Neonatal herpes simplex|neonatal herpes]], and possibly [[Bell's palsy]] are all caused by herpes simplex viruses.

Herpes viruses cycle between periods of active disease—presenting as blisters containing infectious [[virus]] particles—that last 2–21 days, followed by a [[remission (medicine)|remission]] period. Genital herpes, however, is often [[asymptomatic]], though [[viral shedding]] may still occur. After initial infection, the viruses are transported along [[Sensory neuron|sensory nerves]] to the sensory nerve cell bodies, where they become [[Virus latency|latent]] and reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence are uncertain, though some potential triggers have been identified, including immunosuppressant drugs. The previously latent virus then multiplies new virus particles in the nerve cell and these are transported along the [[axon]] of each [[neuron]] to the nerve terminals in the skin, where they are released.  Over time, episodes of active disease reduce in frequency and severity.

Herpes simplex is most easily transmitted by direct contact with a lesion or the body fluid of an infected individual. Transmission may also occur through skin-to-skin contact during periods of asymptomatic shedding. Barrier protection methods are the most reliable method of preventing transmission of herpes, but they merely reduce rather than eliminate risk.  Oral herpes is easily diagnosed if the patient presents with visible sores or ulcers.  Early stages of orofacial herpes and genital herpes are harder to diagnose; laboratory testing is usually required.

A cure for herpes has not yet been developed. Once infected, the virus remains in the body for life. Recurrent infections (outbreaks) may occur from time to time, especially in times of [[immune system|immune]] impairment such as [[HIV]] and [[cancer]]-related immune suppression.<ref name="Cancer">{{cite journal |author=Elad S |title=A systematic review of viral infections associated with oral involvement in cancer patients: a spotlight on Herpesviridea |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=993–1006 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20544224 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g476114717852h80/ |doi=10.1007/s00520-010-0900-3 |author-separator=, |author2=Zadik Y |author3=Hewson I |display-authors=3 |last4=Hovan |first4=Allan |last5=Correa |first5=M. Elvira P. |last6=Logan |first6=Richard |last7=Elting |first7=Linda S. |last8=Spijkervet |first8=Fred K. L. |last9=Brennan |first9=Michael T.}}</ref> However, after several years, outbreaks become less severe and more sporadic, and some people will become perpetually [[asymptomatic]] and will no longer experience outbreaks, though they may still be contagious to others. Treatments with [[antivirals]] can reduce viral shedding and alleviate the severity of symptomatic episodes.  It should not be confused with conditions caused by other viruses in the ''[[herpesviridae]]'' family such as [[herpes zoster]], which is caused by [[varicella zoster virus]]. The [[differential diagnosis]] includes [[hand, foot and mouth disease]] due to similar lesions on the skin.

==Classification==
Herpes simplex is divided into two types: HSV type 1 and HSV type 2.<!-- <ref name=Peds09/> -->  HSV1 causes primarily mouth, throat, face, eye, and [[central nervous system]] infections, whereas HSV2 causes primarily anogenital infections.<!-- <ref name=Peds09/> -->  However, each may cause infections in all areas.<ref name=Peds09/>

==Signs and symptoms==
HSV infection causes several distinct medical [[Disorder (medicine)|disorders]].  Common infection of the skin or mucosa may affect the face and mouth (orofacial herpes), genitalia (genital herpes), or hands ([[herpetic whitlow]]).  More serious disorders occur when the virus infects and damages the eye ([[Herpes of the eye|herpes keratitis]]), or invades the central nervous system, damaging the brain (herpes encephalitis).  People with immature or suppressed immune systems, such as newborns, transplant recipients, or people with AIDS  are prone to severe complications from HSV infections. HSV infection has also been associated with cognitive deficits of [[bipolar disorder]],<ref name="Dickerson2004 Mar 15">{{cite journal|author=Dickerson FB |title=Infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 is associated with cognitive deficits in bipolar disorder |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=588–93 |year=2004 |month=Marc|pmid=15013827|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2003.10.008|author-separator=,|author2=Boronow JJ|author3=Stallings C|display-authors=3|last4=Origoni|first4=Andrea E|last5=Cole|first5=Sara|last6=Krivogorsky|first6=Bogdana|last7=Yolken|first7=Robert H}}</ref> and [[Alzheimer's disease]], although this is often dependent on the [[genetics]] of the infected person.

In all cases HSV is never removed from the body by the [[immune system]].  Following a primary infection, the virus enters the nerves at the site of primary infection, migrates to the [[cell body]] of the neuron, and becomes latent in the [[ganglion]].<ref name="pmid18156035">{{cite journal |author=Gupta R, Warren T, Wald A |title=Genital herpes |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9605 |pages=2127–37 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18156035 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61908-4 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(07)61908-4}}</ref> As a result of primary infection, the body produces antibodies to the particular type of HSV involved, preventing a subsequent infection of that type at a different site. In HSV-1 infected individuals, [[seroconversion]] after an oral infection will prevent additional HSV-1 infections such as [[whitlow]], [[genital herpes]], and [[herpes of the eye]]. Prior HSV-1 seroconversion seems to reduce the symptoms of a later HSV-2 infection, although HSV-2 can still be contracted.

Many people infected with HSV-2 display no physical symptoms—individuals with no symptoms are described as asymptomatic or as having [[Subclinical infection|subclinical]] herpes.<ref name="pmid11095834">{{cite journal |author=Handsfield HH |title=Public Health Strategies to Prevent Genital Herpes: Where Do We Stand? |journal=Curr Infect Dis Rep |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=25–30 |year=2000 |pmid=11095834 |doi=10.1007/s11908-000-0084-y}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Primary orofacial herpes is readily identified by clinical examination of persons with no previous history of lesions and contact with an individual with known HSV-1 infection. The appearance and distribution of sores in these individuals typically presents as multiple, round, superficial oral ulcers, accompanied by acute [[gingivitis]].<ref name="pmid17939933">{{cite journal |author=Fatahzadeh M, Schwartz RA |title=Human herpes simplex virus infections: epidemiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology, diagnosis, and management |journal=J.

Prodromal symptoms that occur before the appearance of herpetic lesions help differentiate HSV symptoms from the similar symptoms of other disorders, such as [[allergy|allergic]] [[stomatitis]].  When lesions do not appear inside the mouth, primary orofacial herpes is sometimes mistaken for [[impetigo]], a bacterial [[infection]]. Common mouth ulcers ([[aphthous ulcer]]) also resemble intraoral herpes, but do not present a [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicular]] stage.<ref name="pmid17939933"/>

Genital herpes can be more difficult to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms.<ref name="pmid17939933"/> Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]], [[lichen planus]], [[atopic dermatitis]], and [[urethritis]].<ref name="pmid17939933"/> [[Laboratory]] testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include: culture of the virus, [[direct fluorescent antibody]] (DFA) studies to detect virus, [[skin biopsy]], and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.<ref name="pmid17939933"/>

Until recently, [[Serology|serological]] tests for antibodies to HSV were rarely useful to diagnosis and not routinely used in clinical practice.<ref name="pmid17939933"/>  The older IgM serologic assay could not differentiate between antibodies generated in response to HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection.  However, the new Immunodot glycoprotein G-specific (IgG) HSV test is more than 98% specific at discriminating HSV-1 from HSV-2.<ref name="ClinMicro1988;26:662-667">{{cite journal |author=Ashley RL, et. al. |title=Comparison of Western blot (immunoblot) and glycoprotein G-specific immunodot enzyme assay for detecting antibodies to herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 in human sera |journal=J.

However, asymptomatic carriers of the HSV-2 virus are still contagious.  In many infections, the first symptom a person will have of their own infection is the horizontal transmission to a sexual partner or the vertical transmission of neonatal herpes to a newborn at term. Since most asymptomatic individuals are unaware of their infection, they are considered at high risk for spreading HSV.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

To prevent neonatal infections, seronegative women are recommended to avoid unprotected oral-genital contact with an HSV-1 seropositive partner and conventional sex with a partner having a genital infection during the last trimester of pregnancy. Mothers infected with HSV are advised to avoid procedures that would cause trauma to the infant during birth (e.g. fetal scalp electrodes, forceps, and vacuum extractors) and, should lesions be present, to elect [[caesarean section]] to reduce exposure of the child to infected secretions in the birth canal.<ref name="pmid18156035"/> The use of antiviral treatments, such as acyclovir, given from the 36th week of pregnancy, limits HSV recurrence and shedding during childbirth, thereby reducing the need for caesarean section.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>

===Alternative medicine===
Certain [[dietary supplement]]s and [[Complementary and alternative medicine|alternative remedies]] are claimed to be beneficial in the treatment of herpes.

==Prognosis==
Following active infection, herpes viruses establish a [[Virus latency|latent]] infection in sensory and autonomic [[ganglia]] of the nervous system.  The double-stranded DNA of the virus is incorporated into the cell physiology by infection of the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of a nerve's [[Soma (biology)|cell body]].  HSV latency is static—no virus is produced—and is controlled by a number of viral genes, including [[HHV LAT|Latency Associated Transcript]] (LAT).<ref name="pmid12409612">{{cite journal |author=Stumpf MP, Laidlaw Z, Jansen VA |title=Herpes viruses hedge their bets |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=99 |issue=23 |pages=15234–7 |year=2002 |pmid=12409612 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/23/15234 |doi=10.1073/pnas.232546899 |pmc=137573}}</ref>

Many HSV-infected people experience recurrence within the first year of infection.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  [[Prodrome]] precedes development of lesions.  Prodromal symptoms include tingling ([[paresthesia]]), itching, and pain where lumbosacral nerves innervate the skin. Prodrome may occur as long as several days or as short as a few hours before lesions develop.  Beginning antiviral treatment when prodrome is experienced can reduce the appearance and duration of lesions in some individuals. During recurrence, fewer lesions are likely to develop, lesions are less painful and heal faster (within 5–10 days without antiviral treatment) than those occurring during the primary infection.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  Subsequent outbreaks tend to be periodic or episodic, occurring on average four to five times a year when not using antiviral therapy.

The causes of reactivation are uncertain, but several potential triggers have been documented. A recent study (2009) showed that the protein [[VP16]] plays a key role in reactivation of the dormant virus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/42223/title/How_herpes_re-rears_its_ugly_head_ |title=How Herpes Re-rears Its Ugly Head |work=Science News }}</ref><!--PMID 19321615 and PMID 19325890 possible sources, --> Changes in the immune system during [[menstruation]] may play a role in HSV-1 reactivation.<ref name="pmid11022124">{{cite journal |author=Myśliwska J, Trzonkowski P, Bryl E, Lukaszuk K, Myśliwski A |title=Lower interleukin-2 and higher serum tumor necrosis factor-a levels are associated with perimenstrual, recurrent, facial Herpes simplex infection in young women |journal=Eur.

The frequency and severity of recurrent outbreaks vary greatly between people. Some individuals' outbreaks can be quite debilitating with large, painful lesions persisting for several weeks, while others will experience only minor itching or burning for a few days. There is some evidence that genetics plays a role in the frequency of cold sore outbreaks.  An area of human chromosome 21 that includes 6 genes has been linked to frequent oral herpes outbreaks. An immunity to the virus is built over time. Most infected individuals will experience fewer outbreaks and outbreak symptoms will often become less severe. After several years, some people will become perpetually [[asymptomatic]] and will no longer experience outbreaks, though they may still be contagious to others. Immuno-compromised individuals may experience episodes that are longer, more frequent, and more severe.  Antiviral medication has been proven to shorten the frequency and duration of outbreaks.<ref name="pmid18192785">{{cite journal |author=Martinez V, Caumes E, Chosidow O |title=Treatment to prevent recurrent genital herpes |journal=Curr Opin Infect Dis |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=42–48 |year=2008 |pmid=18192785 |doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e3282f3d9d3}}</ref>  Outbreaks may occur at the original site of the infection or in proximity to nerve endings that reach out from the infected ganglia.

==History==
Herpes has been known for at least 2,000 years. It is said that Emperor [[Tiberius]] banned kissing in Rome for a time due to so many people having cold sores. In the 16th century ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', it is mentioned that there are blisters "o'er ladies' lips." In 18th century it was so common among prostitutes that it was called "a vocational disease of women."<ref name=scarlet /> The term ''Herpes Simplex'' appeared in [[Richard Boulton]]'s A System of Rational and Practical Chirurgery in 1713, where the terms ''Herpes miliaris'' and ''Herpes exedens'' also appeared. Herpes was not found to be a virus until the 1940s.<ref name=scarlet />

Herpes antiviral therapy began in the early 1960s with the experimental use of medication that interfered with viral replication called [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illness such as adult encephalitis,<ref name="pmid4790599">{{cite journal

Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1977.

==Society and culture==
Herpes simplex was not always stigmatised. It was merely a cold sore in an unusual place until the 1970s.<!--where?--> As late as 1975, a study of "Psychological morbidity in a clinic for sexually transmitted disease” does not mention herpes simplex because at that time, there was no significant morbidity problem (i.e. mental anxiety or illness) associated with the virus.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1045113|title=Psychological morbidity in a clinic for sexually transmitted disease|year=1975|volume=51|issue=1|pmid=1173225|last1=Mayou|first1=R|pages=57–60|journal=The British journal of venereal diseases}}</ref>

Pedro Cuatrecasas states, "during the R&D of acyclovir (Zovirax), marketing [department of Burroughs Wellcome] insisted that there were 'no markets’ for this compound. Most had hardly heard of genital herpes...” Thus marketing the medical condition – separating the 'normal cold sore’ from the 'stigmatized genital infection’ was to become the key to marketing the drug, a process now known as 'disease mongering’.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moynihan R, Heath I, Henry D |title=Selling sickness: the pharmaceutical industry and disease mongering |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7342 |pages=886–91 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=11950740 |pmc=1122833 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11950740 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.886}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Cuatrecasas P |title=Drug discovery in jeopardy |journal=J.

Since the creation of the herpes hype, some people experience negative feelings related to the condition following diagnosis, in particular if they have acquired the genital form of the disease. Feelings can include [[Depression (mood)|depression]], fear of rejection, feelings of [[Solitude|isolation]], fear of being found out, and self-destructive feelings.<ref name=Vezina>{{cite journal| author=Vezina C, Steben M.| title=Genital Herpes: Psychosexual Impacts and Counselling| journal=The Canadian Journal of CME| year=2001| pages=125–34| issue=June| url=http://www.stacommunications.com/journals/cme/images/cmepdf/june01/hsv.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> These feelings usually lessen over time. Much of the hysteria and stigma surrounding herpes stems from a media campaign beginning in the late 1970s and peaking in the early 1980s. There were multiple articles worded in fear-mongering and anxiety-provoking terminology, such as the now ubiquitous "attacks," "outbreaks," "victims," and "sufferers." At one point the term "herpetic" even entered the popular lexicon. The articles were published by ''Reader's Digest'', ''U.S. News'', and ''Time'' magazine, among others. A made-for-TV movie was named ''Intimate Agony.'' The peak was when ''Time'' magazine had 'Herpes: The New Scarlet Letter' on the cover in August 1982, forever stigmatizing the word in the public mind.<ref name=scarlet>{{cite news |title= The New Scarlet Letter |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |author= John Leo |date= 1982-08-02 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1715020,00.html}}</ref> [[Herpes support groups]] have been formed in the United States and the UK, providing information about herpes and running message forums and dating websites for sufferers. People with the herpes virus are often hesitant to divulge to other people, including friends and family, that they are infected. This is especially true of new or potential sexual partners whom they consider casual.<ref name=Green>{{cite journal|last=Green|first=J|coauthors=Ferrier, S; Kocsis, A; Shadrick, J; Ukoumunne, OC; Murphy, S; Hetherton, J|title=Determinants of disclosure of genital herpes to partners.|journal=Sexually transmitted infections|date=2003 Feb|volume=79|issue=1|pages=42–4|pmid=12576613}}</ref>

==Research==
{{Main|Herpes simplex research}}
Researchers at the [[University of Florida]] have made a [[Hammerhead ribozyme]] that targets and cleaves the mRNA of essential genes in HSV-1. The hammerhead, which targets the mRNA of the UL20 gene, greatly reduced the level of HSV-1 ocular infection in rabbits, and reduced the viral yield in vivo.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liu J, Tuli SS, Bloom DC, Schultz GS, Ghivizzani SC, Lewin AS |title=801. RNA Gene Therapy Targeting Herpes Simplex Virus |journal=Molecular Therapy |volume=13 |page=S310 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.ymthe.2006.08.890 |url=http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v13/n1s/abs/mt2006942a.html }}</ref> The gene-targeting approach uses a specially designed RNA enzyme to inhibit strains of the herpes simplex virus. The enzyme disables a gene responsible for producing a protein involved in the maturation and release of viral particles in an infected cell. The technique appears to be effective in experiments with mice and rabbits, but further research is required before it can be attempted in people infected with herpes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ufl.edu/2009/02/03/herpes-2/ |title=Potential new herpes therapy studied |publisher=University of Florida News |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref>

Another possibility to eradicate the HSV-1 variant is being pursued by a team at [[Duke University]]. By figuring out how to switch all copies of the virus in the host from latency to their active stage at the same time, rather than the way the virus copies normally stagger their activity stage, leaving some dormant somewhere at all times, it is thought that conventional anti-viral drugs can kill the entire virus population completely, since they can no longer hide in the nerve cells. One class of drugs called [[antagomir]] could serve this purpose. These are chemically engineered oligonucleotides or short segments of RNA, that can be made to mirror their target genetic material, namely herpes microRNAs. They could be engineered to attach and thus 'silence' the microRNA, thus rendering the virus incapable of remaining latent in its host.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fox |first=Maggie |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0229815620080702?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=New approach offers chance to finally kill herpes |publisher=Reuters |date= 2008-07-02|accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref> Professor Cullen believes a drug could be developed to block the microRNA whose job it is to suppress HSV-1 into latency.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1819739,00.html | work=Time | title=A Cure for Cold Sores? | date=2008-07-02 | accessdate=2010-05-04 | first=Kathleen | last=Kingsbury}}</ref>
