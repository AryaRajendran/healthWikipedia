'''Home care''', (also referred to as '''domiciliary care''' or '''social care'''), is [[health care]] or supportive care provided in the [[patient|patient's]] [[home]] by licensed [[healthcare professional]]s. It is often referred to as home health care or formal care. Often, the term '''home ''health'' care''' is used to distinguish it from '''non-medical care''' or '''custodial care''', which is care that is provided by persons who are not nurses, doctors, or other licensed medical personnel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.Homecare.com |title=www.Homecare.com |publisher=www.Homecare.com |date= |accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 

Licensed personnel and others who assist the individual may be referred to as [[caregiver]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/caregiver|title=Caregiver|publisher= The Free Dictionary By Farlex |accessdate=2012-15-06}}</ref> Caregivers may help the individual with such daily tasks as bathing, eating, cleaning the home and preparing meals.

For terminally ill patients, home care may include hospice care. For patients recovering from surgery or illness, home care may include rehabilitative assistance.<ref>{{cite web|title=DEFINITION OF CARING FOR ELDERLY|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/76217-definition-caring-elderly/|publisher=LiveStrong.com|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref> 

==United States==
===Professionals providing care===
Professionals providing home care include [[licensed practical nurse]]s, [[registered nurse]]s, home care aides, and [[social workers]]. Rehabilitation services may be provided by [[physical therapist]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, [[speech and language pathologist]]s and [[dietitians]].{{cn|date=June 2012}}

Home care aides are trained to provide non-custodial or non-medical care, such as helping with dressing, bathing, getting in and out of bed, and using the toilet. They may also prepare meals.{{cn|date=June 2012}}

===Concept===
"Home care", "home health care" and "in-home care" are phrases that are used interchangeably in the United States to mean any type of care given to a person in their own home. These phrases have been used in the past interchangeably regardless of whether the person required skilled care or not. More recently, there is a growing movement to distinguish between "home health care" meaning skilled nursing care (usually provided by a Home Health Agency) and "home care" (provided by Homecare Agency or independent home health aide or caregiver) meaning non-medical care.{{cn|date=June 2012}}

Home care aims to make it possible for people to remain at home rather than use residential, long-term, or institutional-based nursing care. Home care providers deliver services in the client's own home. These services may include some combination of professional health care services and life assistance services. Professional home health services could include medical or psychological assessment, wound care, medication teaching, pain management, disease education and management, physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy. Life assistance services include help with daily tasks such as meal preparation, medication reminders, laundry, light housekeeping, errands, shopping, transportation, and companionship. Home care is often an integral component of the post-hospitalization recovery process, especially during the initial weeks after discharge when the patient still requires some level of regular physical assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitaltohomecare.com/pages/transitioning.html |title=Hospital to Homecare |publisher=Hospital to Homecare |date= |accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref>

*'''[[Activities of daily living]]''' (ADL) refers to activities, including [[bathing]], dressing, transferring, using the toilet, eating, and walking, that reflect the patient's capacity for self-care.

*'''Instrumental activities of daily living''' (IADL) refers to daily tasks, including light housework, preparing meals, taking medications, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, and managing money, that enables the patient to live independently in the community.

While there are differences in terms used in describing aspects of home care or home health care in the United States and other areas of the world, for the most part the descriptions are very similar.

Estimates for the [[United States|U.S.]] indicate that most home care is informal, with families and friends providing a substantial amount of care. For formal care, the health care professionals most often involved are [[nurse]]s followed by physical [[physical therapy|therapist]]s and home care aides. Other health care providers include [[respiratory therapy|respiratory]] and [[occupational therapy|occupational therapists]], medical [[social worker]]s and [[mental health]] workers. Home health care is generally paid for by [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]],long term insurance, or paid with the patient's own resources.

===Aide worker qualifications===
The state department of health issues requirement for that state. Workers can take an examination to become a state tested [[Certified Nursing Assistant]] (CNA). Other requirements in the U.S.A. often include a background check, drug testing, and general references.<ref>[http://cnafacts.com "Certified Nursing Assistant"], Retrieved on 27 September 2011.</ref>

===Licensure and providers by state===
California does not have licensure for non medical or custodial care services, and as such there are no entry requirements or minimum standards. a

<!---a bit soapbox--->
Full service agencies do preemployment background checks, including ([[criminal]]), department of motor vehicle, and reference checks. Full service agencies also train, monitor and supervise the staff that provide care to clients in their home.

There is a certification available for home care companies in California, administered by the California Association for Health Services at Home.<ref>nttp://www.cahsah.org</ref>

Florida is a licensure state which requires different levels of licensing depending upon the services provided. Companion assistance is provided by a home maker companion agency whereas nursing services and assistance with ADL's can be provided by a home health agency or nurse registry. The state licensing authority is the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdhc.state.fl.us/ |title=AHCA |publisher=Fdhc.state.fl.us |date= |accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref>

===Compensation===
Compensation varies according to discipline, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the 2011 median hourly wage for home health aides was $9.91 per hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes311011.htm |title=Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>

====Supreme Court case relating to fees====
<!---the following needs its own article and summary here--->
For years, home care work has been selectively classified as a “companionship service” and exempted from federal overtime and minimum wage rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The Supreme Court considered arguments on the companionship exemption, which stems from a case brought by a home care worker represented by counsel provided by [[SEIU]]. The original 2003 case, ''Evelyn Coke v. Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. and Maryann Osborne'', argues that agency-employed home caregivers should be covered under overtime and minimum wage regulations.

Evelyn Coke, a home care worker employed by a home care agency that was not paying her overtime, sued the agency in 2003, alleging that the regulation construing the “companionship services” exemption to apply to agency employees and exempt them from the federal minimum wage and overtime law is inconsistent with the law.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/10/nyregion/10coke.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss |title=Evelyn Coke, Home Care Aide Who Fought Pay Rule, Is Dead at 74 (New York Times Aug.9, 2009) |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= 10 August 2009|accessdate=10 March 2012 |first=Douglas |last=Martin}}</ref> The Supreme Court heard the case in 2009.

In the court decision, the court stated the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 exempted from the minimum wage and maximum hours rules of the FSLA persons "employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for individuals ... unable to care for themselves." 29 U. S. C. §213(a)(15). The court found that the DOL's{{Clarify|who or what is "DOL"?|date=August 2011}} power to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the making of rules to fill any 'gap' left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress, and when that agency fills that gap reasonably, it is binding. In this case, one of the gaps was whether to include workers paid by third parties in the exemption and the DOL has done that. Since the DOL has followed public notice procedure, and since there was gap left in the legislation, the DOL's regulation stands and home health care workers are not covered by either minimum wage or overtime pay requirements.

===Statistics on consumers===
====Payment====
710,000 paid by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] - Medicare often is the primary billing source, if this is the primary carrier between two types of insurance (like between Medicare and [[Medicaid]]). Also, if a patient has Medicare and that patient has a "skilled need" requiring nursing visits, the patient's case is typically billed under Medicare.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

235,000 paid by private insurance, or self/family - Private insurance includes VA (Veterans Administration), some Railroad or Steelworkers health plans or other private insurance.  "Self/family" indicates "private pay" status, when the patient or family pays 100% of all home care charges. Home care fees can be quite high; few patients & families can absorb these costs for a long period of time.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==The United Kingdom==
===Home care providers===

Homecare is purchased by the service user directly from independent home care agencies or as part of the statutory responsibility of social services departments of local authorities who either provide care by their own employees or commission services from independent agencies. Care is usually provided once or twice a day with the aim of keeping frail or disabled people healthy and independent though can extend to full-time help by a [[live-in nurse]] or carer.
