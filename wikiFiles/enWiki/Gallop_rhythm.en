A '''gallop rhythm''' refers to a (usually abnormal) rhythm of the heart on [[auscultation]].<ref name="pmid8914783">{{cite journal |author=Tavel ME |title=The appearance of gallop rhythm after exercise stress testing |journal=Clin Cardiol |volume=19 |issue=11 |pages=887–91 |year=1996 |month=November |pmid=8914783 |doi= 10.1002/clc.4960191109|url=}}</ref> It includes three or four sounds,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000093035|gallop rhythm}}</ref> thus resembling the sounds of a [[Horse_gait#Gallop|gallop]].

The normal heart rhythm contains two audible [[heart sounds]] called S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> that give the well-known "lub-dub" rhythm; they are caused by the closing of [[Heart valve|valves]] in the heart.  

A gallop rhythm contains another sound, called [[third heart sound|S<sub>3</sub>]] or [[fourth heart sound|S<sub>4</sub>]], dependent upon where in the cycle this added sound comes. 

It can also contain both of these sounds forming a '''quadruple gallop''', and in situations of very [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]] can produce a '''summation gallop''' where S<sub>3</sub> and S<sub>4</sub> occur so close as to be indistinguishable.

==Associated conditions==
Gallop rhythms may be heard in young or athletic people, but may also be a sign of serious cardiac problems like [[heart failure]] as well as pulmonary edema.
