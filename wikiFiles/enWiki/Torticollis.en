'''Torticollis,''' also known as  '''wry neck''' or '''loxia''',<ref>Not be confused with the genus '''Loxia''' covering those bird species known as "[[crossbills]]", which was assigned by 
Swiss naturalist [[Conrad Gesner]] because of the obvious similarities.</ref>  is a symptom defined by an abnormal, asymmetrical head or neck position, which may be due to a variety of causes.
The term torticollis is derived from the Latin words tortus for twisted and collum for neck.<ref>{{cite journal |

==Description==
Torticollis is a fixed or dynamic tilt, rotation or flexion of the head and/or neck.
The type of torticollis can be described depending on the positions of head and neck as<ref>{{cite journal |

A combination of these movements can often be observed.

==Classification==
A multitude of conditions may lead to the development of Torticollis; including muscular fibrosis, congenital spine abnormalities or toxic or traumatic brain injury.<ref name="The Differential Diagnosis of Torticollis in Children"/>
A rough categorization discerns between [[congenital]] Torticollis and acquired Torticollis.

===Congenital muscular torticollis===
The [[etiology]] of congenital muscular torticollis is unclear. Birth trauma or intrauterine malposition is considered to be the cause of damage to the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]] in the neck.<ref name="The Differential Diagnosis of Torticollis in Children"/>
This results in a shortening or excessive contraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which curtails its range of motion in both rotation and lateral bending. The head is typically tilted in lateral bending toward the affected muscle and rotated toward the opposite side.

The reported incidence of congenital torticollis is 0.3-2.0 %.<ref>Cheng JCY, Wong MWN, Tang SP, Chen TMK, MPhil, Shum SLF, Wong EMC.  Clinical determinants of the outcome of manual stretching in the treatment of congenital muscular torticollis in infants. Bone Joint Surg. 2001;83:679-687.</ref>  Sometimes a mass, such as a sternocleidomastoid tumor, is noted in the affected muscle at the age of two to four weeks.  Gradually it disappears, usually by the age of eight months, but the muscle is left fibrotic.<ref name="The Differential Diagnosis of Torticollis in Children"/>

Initially, the condition is treated with physical therapies, such as stretching to release tightness, strengthening exercises to improve muscular balance, and handling to stimulate symmetry. A TOT Collar is sometimes applied.  About 5&ndash;10% of cases fail to respond to stretching and require surgical release of the muscle.<ref>Tang SF, Hsu KH, Wong AM Hsu CC, Chang CH. Longitudinal followup study of ultrasonography in congenital muscular torticollis. Clin Orthop. 2002;403:179-185.</ref><ref>Hsu TC, Wang CL, Wong MK, Hsu KH, Tang Ft, Chen Ht. Correlation of clinical and ultrasonographic features  in congenital muscular torticollis. Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 1999;80:637-641.</ref>

===Acquired torticollis===
Noncongenital muscular torticollis can result from scarring or disease of cervical vertebrae, adenitis, tonsillitis, rheumatism, enlarged cervical glands, retropharyngeal abscess, or cerebellar tumors. It may be spasmodic (clonic) or permanent (tonic). The latter type may be due to [[Pott's Disease]] (tuberculosis of the spine).

* A self-limiting spontaneously occurring form of torticollis with one or more painful neck muscles is by far the most common ('stiff neck') and will pass spontaneously in 1–4 weeks. Usually the sternocleidomastoid muscle or the trapezius muscle is involved. Sometimes draughts, colds or unusual postures are implicated; however in many cases no clear cause is found. These episodes are rarely seen by doctors other than a family physician.
* Tumors of the skull base (posterior fossa tumors) can compress the nerve supply to the neck and cause torticollis, and these problems must be treated surgically.
* Infections in the posterior [[pharynx]] can irritate the nerves supplying the neck muscles and cause torticollis, and these infections may be treated with antibiotics if they are not too severe, but could require surgical [[debridement]] in intractable cases.
* Ear infections and surgical removal of the [[adenoids]] can cause an entity known as [[Grisel's syndrome]], a subluxation of the upper cervical joints, mostly the atlantoaxial joint, due to inflammatory laxity of the ligaments caused by an infection. This bridge must either be broken through manipulation of the neck, or surgically resected.
* The use of certain drugs, such as [[antipsychotic]]s, can cause torticollis.<ref name="pmid16208529">{{cite journal |author=Dressler D, Benecke R |title=Diagnosis and management of acute movement disorders |journal=J.

* Antiemetics - Neuroleptic Class - Phenothiazines
* There are many other rare causes of torticollis.

====Spasmodic torticollis====
{{Main|spasmodic torticollis}} Torticollis with recurrent but transient contraction of the muscles of the neck and especially of the sternocleidomastoid. Synonyms are "intermittent torticollis", "cervical dystonia" or "idiopathic cervical dystonia", depending on cause

====Acquired Torticollis in Infants====
Infants often develop torticollis as a result of the amount of time they spend lying on their back during the day in car seats, swings, bouncers, strollers and on play mats. Infants with torticollis have a higher risk of [[plagiocephaly]] or flat head syndrome.  Most pediatricians recommend repositioning baby for healthy head and neck movement. Torticollis is almost always preventable in infants.

=====Prevention=====
Correct positioning is important, and most pediatricians recommend parents reposition baby's head every 2–3 hours during waking hours. (At feeding time, diaper changes, while baby sleeps, etc.) 

If torticollis is not corrected, facial asymmetry often develops.<ref>Yu C-C, Wong F-W, Lo L-J, et al. Craniofacial deformity in patients with uncorrected congenital muscular torticollis: an assessment from three-dimensional computed tomography imaging. Plast Reconstr Surg. 2004;113:24–33.</ref> Head position needs to be corrected before about the age of 18 months for there to be improvement. Younger children show the best results.

Common treatments{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} might involve a multi-phase process:
# Low-impact exercise to increase strong form neck stability
# Manipulation of the neck by an [[Occupational Therapist]], Doctor of Chiropractic, Physical Therapist, or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]].
# Extended heat application.
# Repetitive shiatsu massage.

=====Diagnosis=====
Evaluation of a child with torticollis begins with history taking to determine circumstances surrounding birth and any possibility of trauma or associated symptoms. Physical examination reveals decreased rotation and bending to the side opposite from the affected muscle. Some say that congenital cases more often involve the right side, but there is not complete agreement about this in published studies. Evaluation should include a thorough neurologic examination, and the possibility of associated conditions such as developmental [[Hip dysplasia (human)|dysplasia of the hip]] and [[clubfoot]] should be examined.  Radiographs of the cervical spine should be obtained to rule out obvious bony abnormality, and MRI should be considered if there is concern about structural problems or other conditions.

Evaluation by an [[ophthalmologist]] should be considered in children to ensure that the torticollis is not caused by vision problems ([[Trochlear nerve|IV cranial nerve]] [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]], [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]]-associated "null position," etc.).

==Veterinary Medicine==
[[File:Mvc-872s.jpg|thumb|A [[guinea pig]] with a head-tilt]]
In veterinary literature usually only the lateral bend of head and neck is termed torticollis, whereas the analogon to the rotatory torticollis in humans is called a head tilt.
The most frequently encountered form of torticollis in domestic pets is the head tilt, but occasionally a lateral bend of the head and neck to one side is encountered.

===Head tilt===
Causes for a head tilt in domestic animals are either diseases of the central or peripher vestibular system or relieving posture due to neck pain.
Known causes for head tilt in domestic animals include
