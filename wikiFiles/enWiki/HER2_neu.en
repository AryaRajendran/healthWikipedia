'''HER2''' (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) also known as '''Neu''', '''ErbB-2''', '''CD340''' ([[cluster of differentiation]] 340) or '''p185''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''ERBB2'' [[gene]]. HER2 is a member of the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR/ErbB) family. [[Gene duplication|Amplification]] or over-expression of this gene has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of certain aggressive types of [[breast cancer]] and in recent years it has evolved to become an important [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]] and target of therapy for the disease.

== Function ==

=== Gene ===
HER2 is encoded by ''ERBB2'', a known [[proto-oncogene]] located at the long arm of human [[chromosome 17]] (17q12). HER2 is named because it has a similar structure to human epidermal growth factor receptor, or HER1.  Neu is so named because it was derived from a rodent [[glioblastoma]] cell line, a type of neural tumor. ErbB-2 was named for its similarity to ''ERBB'' (avian erythroblastosis oncogene B), the [[oncogene]] later found to code for [[Epidermal growth factor receptor | EGFR]].  Gene cloning showed that HER2, Neu, and ErbB-2 are all encoded by the same [[gene]].<ref name="Coussens_1985">{{cite journal | author = Coussens L, Yang-Feng TL, Liao YC, Chen E, Gray A, McGrath J, Seeburg PH, Libermann TA, Schlessinger J, Francke U | title = Tyrosine kinase receptor with extensive homology to EGF receptor shares chromosomal location with neu oncogene | journal = Science | volume = 230 | issue = 4730 | pages = 1132–9 | year = 1985 | month = December | pmid = 2999974 | doi = 10.1126/science.2999974 }}</ref>

=== Protein ===
The ErbB family is composed of four [[cell membrane|plasma membrane]]-bound [[receptor tyrosine kinase]]s. All four contain an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain that can interact with a multitude of signaling molecules and exhibit both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activity.  HER2 can heterodimerise with any of the other three receptors and is considered to be the preferred dimerisation partner of the other ErbB receptors.<ref name="Olayioye_2001">{{cite journal | author = Olayioye MA | title = Update on HER-2 as a target for cancer therapy: Intracellular signaling pathways of ErbB2/HER-2 and family members | journal = Breast Cancer Res | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 385–389 | year= 2001| doi = 10.1186/bcr327 | pmid = 11737890 | pmc = 138705 }}</ref> Dimerisation results in the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors and initiates a variety of signaling pathways.

=== Signal transduction ===
Signaling pathways activated by HER2 include:<ref name="pmid19887469">{{cite journal | author = Roy V, Perez EA | title = Beyond trastuzumab: small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in HER-2-positive breast cancer | journal = Oncologist | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 1061–9 | year = 2009 | month = November | pmid = 19887469 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.2009-0142 }}</ref>
* [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] (MAPK)
* [[phosphoinositide 3-kinase]] (PI3K/Akt)
* [[phospholipase C]] γ
* [[protein kinase C]] (PKC)
* [[STAT protein|Signal transducer and activator of transcription]] (STAT)

In summary, signaling through the ErbB family of receptors promotes cell proliferation and opposes [[apoptosis]], and therefore must be tightly regulated to prevent uncontrolled cell growth from occurring.

==HER2 and cancer==
Amplification or over-expression of the ''ERBB2'' gene occurs in approximately 30% of breast cancers. It is strongly associated with increased disease recurrence and a poor prognosis.<ref name="pmid17993237">{{cite journal | author = Tan M, Yu D | title = Molecular mechanisms of erbB2-mediated breast cancer chemoresistance | journal = Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. | volume = 608 | issue = | pages = 119–29 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17993237 | doi = }}</ref> Over-expression is also known to occur in ovarian, stomach, and aggressive forms of uterine cancer, such as uterine serous [[endometrial carcinoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Santin AD, Bellone S, Roman JJ, McKenney JK, Pecorelli S.|title=Trastuzumab treatment in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma overexpressing HER2/neu|journal= Int J Gynaecol Obstet |volume= 102 |issue= 2 |pages= 128–31 |year= 2008 |pmid= 18555254 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2008.04.008}}</ref>

HER2 is co-localized, and, most of the time, co-amplified with the gene [[GRB7]], which is a proto-oncogene associated with breast, testicular germ cell, gastric, and esophageal tumours.

HER2 proteins have been shown to form clusters in cell membranes that may play a role in tumorigenesis.<ref name="pmid10318765">{{cite journal | author = Nagy P, Jenei A, Kirsch AK, Szöllosi J, Damjanovich S, Jovin TM | title = Activation-dependent clustering of the erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase detected by scanning near-field optical microscopy | journal = J.

==Drugs targeting HER2==
HER2 is the target of the [[monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] [[trastuzumab]] (marketed as Herceptin).  Trastuzumab is effective only in cancers where HER2 is over-expressed. An important downstream effect of trastuzumab binding to HER2 is an increase in [[CDKN1B|p27]], a protein that halts cell proliferation.<ref name="Le_2005">{{cite journal |author=XF Le, Franz Pruefer, Robert Bast.|title=HER2-targeting antibodies modulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 via multiple signaling pathways|journal= Cell Cycle |volume= 4 |issue= 1 |pages= 87–95 |year= 2005 |pmid= 15611642 |doi=10.4161/cc.4.1.1360}}</ref> Another monoclonal antibody, [[Pertuzumab]], which inhibits dimerization of HER2 and HER3 receptors, was approved by the FDA for use in combination with trastuzumab in June 2012.

Additionally, [[NeuVax]] ([[Galena Biopharma]]) is a peptide-based immunotherapy that directs "killer" [[T cell]]s to target and destroy cancer cells that express HER2. It has entered phase 3 clinical trials. 

It is revealed that patients with ER+ ([[Estrogen receptor]] positive)/HER2+ compared with ER-/HER2+ breast cancers may actually benefit more from drugs that inhibit the PI3K/AKT molecular pathway.<ref name="pmid19552798">{{cite journal | author = Loi S, Sotiriou C, Haibe-Kains B, Lallemand F, Conus NM, Piccart MJ, Speed TP, McArthur GA | title = Gene expression profiling identifies activated growth factor signaling in poor prognosis (Luminal-B) estrogen receptor positive breast cancer | journal = BMC Med Genomics | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 37 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19552798 | pmc = 2706265 | doi = 10.1186/1755-8794-2-37 | laysummary = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100506112557.htm | laysource = ScienceDaily }}</ref>

Over-expression of HER2 can also be suppressed by the amplification of other genes. Research is currently being conducted to discover which genes may have this desired effect. 

The expression of HER2 is regulated by signaling through estrogen receptors.  Normally, [[estradiol]] and [[tamoxifen]] acting through the estrogen receptor down-regulate the expression of HER2.  However, when the ratio of the [[coactivator (genetics)|coactivator]] [[nuclear receptor coactivator 3|AIB-3]] exceeds that of the  [[corepressor (genetics)|corepressor]] [[PAX2]], the expression of HER2 is upregulated in the presence of tamoxifen, leading to tamoxifen-resistant [[breast cancer]].<ref name="urlCORDIS : News">{{cite web | url = http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=EN_NEWS&ACTION=D&SESSION=&RCN=30093 | title = Study sheds new light on tamoxifen resistance | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2008-11-13 | format = | work = Cordis News | publisher = Cordis | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-11-14}}</ref><ref name="Hurtado1_2008">{{cite journal | author = Hurtado A, Holmes KA, Geistlinger TR, Hutcheson IR, Nicholson RI, Brown M, Jiang J, Howat WJ, Ali S, Carroll JS | title = ERBB2 regulation by Estrogen Receptor-Pax2 determines tamoxifen response | journal = Nature | volume = 456| issue = 7222| pages = 663–6| year = 2008 | month = November | pmid = 19005469 | pmc = 2920208 | doi = 10.1038/nature07483 | url =  }}</ref>

Recent evidence has implicated HER2 signaling in resistance to the [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]]-targeted cancer drug [[cetuximab]].<ref name="YonesakaZejnullahu2011">{{cite journal | author = Yonesaka K, Zejnullahu K, Okamoto I, ''et al.'' | title = Activation of ERBB2 signaling causes resistance to the EGFR-directed therapeutic antibody cetuximab | journal = Sci Transl Med | volume = 3 | issue = 99 | pages = 99ra86 | year = 2011 | month = September | pmid = 21900593 | pmc = 3268675 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.3002442 }}</ref>

Furthermore, diverse structural alterations have been identified that cause ligand-independent firing of this receptor, doing so in the absence of receptor over-expression. As stated the HER2 is found in a variety of tumours and some of these tumours carry point mutations in the sequence specifying the transmembrane domain of HER2. The resulting substitution of a valine for a glutamic acid results in the constitutive dimerisation of this protein in the absence of a ligand.

==HER2 testing==

HER2 testing is performed in breast cancer patients to assess prognosis and to determine suitability for trastazumab therapy. It is important that trastazumab is restricted to HER2-positive individuals as it is expensive and has been associated with cardiac toxicity.<ref name="pmid17687157">{{cite journal | author = Telli ML, Hunt SA, Carlson RW, Guardino AE | title = Trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity: calling into question the concept of reversibility | journal = J.

Tests are usually performed on [[biopsy]] samples obtained by either [[fine-needle aspiration]],  core needle biopsy, [[vacuum-assisted breast biopsy]], or surgical excision. [[Immunohistochemistry]] is used to measure the amount of HER2 protein present in the sample. Alternatively, [[fluorescence in situ hybridisation]] (FISH) can be used to measure the number of copies of the gene which are present.

The extracellular domain of HER2 can be shed from the surface of tumour cells and enter the circulation. Measurement of serum HER2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]) offers a far less invasive method of determining HER2 status than a biopsy and consequently has been extensively investigated. Results so far have suggested that changes in serum HER2 concentrations may be useful in predicting response to trastazumab therapy.<ref name="pmid18661530">{{cite journal | author = Ali SM, Carney WP, Esteva FJ, Fornier M, Harris L, Köstler WJ, Lotz JP, Luftner D, Pichon MF, Lipton A | title = Serum HER-2/neu and relative resistance to trastuzumab-based therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer | journal = Cancer | volume = 113 | issue = 6 | pages = 1294–301 | year = 2008 | month = September | pmid = 18661530 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.23689 }}</ref> However, its ability to determine eligibility for trastazumab therapy is less clear.<ref name="pmid19255335">{{cite journal | author = Lennon S, Barton C, Banken L, Gianni L, Marty M, Baselga J, Leyland-Jones B | title = Utility of serum HER2 extracellular domain assessment in clinical decision making: pooled analysis of four trials of trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer | journal = J.
