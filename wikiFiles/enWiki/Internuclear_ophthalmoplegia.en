'''Internuclear ophthalmoplegia''' ('''INO''') is a disorder of [[conjugate lateral gaze]] in which the affected eye shows impairment of [[adduction]].  When an attempt is made to gaze contralaterally (relative to the affected eye), the affected eye adducts minimally, if at all.  The contralateral eye [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abducts]], however with [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]].  Additionally, the divergence of the eyes leads to horizontal [[diplopia]]. That is, if the right eye is affected the patient will "see double" when looking to the left, seeing two images side-by-side. [[Convergence (eye)|Convergence]] is generally preserved.

==Causes==

The disorder is caused by injury or dysfunction in the [[medial longitudinal fasciculus]] (MLF), a heavily-myelinated tract that allows conjugate eye movement by connecting the [[paramedian pontine reticular formation]] (PPRF)-[[abducens nucleus]] complex of the contralateral side to the [[oculomotor nucleus]] of the ipsilateral side.

In young patients with bilateral INO, [[multiple sclerosis]] is often the cause. In older patients with one-sided lesions a stroke is a distinct possibility. Other causes are possible.<ref name="pmid15883257">{{cite journal |author=Keane JR |title=Internuclear ophthalmoplegia: unusual causes in 114 of 410 patients |journal=Arch.

==Variants==

A [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] lesion within the midbrain may affect the convergence center thus causing bilateral divergence of the eyes which is known as the WEBINO syndrome ( Wall Eyed Bilateral INO)<ref name="pmid2094199">{{cite journal |author=Lana MA, Moreira PR, Neves LB |title=Wall-eyed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (Webino syndrome) and myelopathy in pyoderma gangrenosum |journal=Arq Neuropsiquiatr |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=497–501 |year=1990 |month=December |pmid=2094199 |doi= |url=}}</ref> as each eye looks at the opposite "wall".

If the lesion affects the [[PPRF]] (or the abducens nucleus) and the [[Medial longitudinal fasciculus|MLF]] on the same side (the MLF having crossed from the opposite side), then the "[[one and a half syndrome]]" occurs which, simply put, involves paralysis of all conjugate horizontal  eye movements other than abduction of the eye on the opposite side to the lesion.
