The '''Beck Depression Inventory''' ('''BDI''', '''BDI-II'''), created by Dr. [[Aaron T. Beck]], is a 21-question [[Multiple choice|multiple-choice]] [[self-report inventory]], one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of [[Clinical depression|depression]]. Its development marked a shift among health care professionals, who had until then viewed depression from a [[psychodynamic]] perspective, instead of it being rooted in the patient's own thoughts.

In its current version the questionnaire is designed for individuals aged 13 and over, and is composed of items relating to symptoms of depression such as hopelessness and irritability, cognitions such as guilt or feelings of being punished, as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue, [[weight loss]], and lack of interest in sex.<ref name="Beck, A.T.">{{cite book|author=Beck AT |year-=1972|title=Depression: Causes and Treatment|location= Philadelphia|publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn= 0-8122-1032-8|year=2006}}</ref>

There are three versions of the BDI—the original BDI, first published in 1961 and later revised in 1978 as the BDI-1A, and the BDI-II, published in 1996. The BDI is widely used as an assessment tool by health care professionals and researchers in a variety of settings.

==Development and history==
Historically, depression was described in [[psychodynamic]] terms as "inverted hostility against the self".<ref name=McGrawHill>McGraw Hill Publishing Company [http://www.mhhe.com/mayfieldpub/psychtesting/profiles/beck.htm "Test developer profile: Aaron T. Beck"].Retrieved on 2009-02-24</ref> By contrast, the BDI was developed in a novel way for its time; by collating patients' verbatim descriptions of their symptoms and using these to structure a scale which could reflect the intensity or severity of a given symptom.<ref name="Beck, A.T."/>  

Throughout his work, Beck drew attention to the importance of "negative cognitions": sustained, inaccurate, and often intrusive negative thoughts about the self.<ref name=Allen>{{cite web|author=Allen JP|year=2003|title=An Overview of Beck's Cognitive Theory of Depression in Contemporary Literature|url= http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/allen.html|accessdate=2004-02-24}}</ref> In his view, it was the case that these cognitions ''caused'' depression, rather than being generated ''by'' depression.

Beck developed a triad of negative cognitions about the world, the future, and the self, which play a major role in depression.
An example of the triad in action taken from Brown (1995) is the case of a student obtaining poor exam results:
* The student has negative thoughts about the ''world'', so he may come to believe he does not enjoy the class.
* The student has negative thoughts about his ''future'', because he thinks he may not pass the class.
* The student has negative thoughts about his ''self'', as he may feel he does not deserve to be in college.<ref name="pmid7673566">{{cite journal |author=Brown GP, Hammen CL, Craske MG, Wickens TD |title=Dimensions of dysfunctional attitudes as vulnerabilities to depressive symptoms |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=431–5 |year=1995 |month=August |pmid=7673566 |doi= 10.1037/0021-843X.104.3.431|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/104/3/431 |accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>

The development of the BDI reflects that in its structure, with items such as "I have lost all of my interest in other people" to reflect the world, "I feel discouraged about the future" to reflect the future, and "I blame myself for everything bad that happens" to reflect the self. The view of depression as sustained by intrusive negative cognitions has had particular application in [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), which aims to challenge and neutralize them through techniques such as [[cognitive restructuring]].

===BDI===
The original BDI, first published in 1961,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beck AT, Ward CH, Mendelson M, Mock J, Erbaugh J |title=An inventory for measuring depression |journal=Arch. Gen. Psychiatry |volume=4 |issue= 6|pages=561–71 |year=1961 |month=June |pmid=13688369 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1961.01710120031004}}</ref> consisted of twenty-one questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last week. Each question has a set of at least four possible answer choices, ranging in intensity. For example:

* (0) I do not feel sad.
* (1) I feel sad.
* (2) I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it.
* (3) I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it.

When the test is scored, a value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-offs are as follows:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beck AT, Steer RA, Garbin MG J |title=Psychometric properties of the Beck Depression Inventory Twenty-five years of evaluation |journal=Clin. Psych. Review |volume=8 |issue=  |pages=77–100 |year=1988 |month= |pmid= |doi= }}</ref> 
*0–9:  indicates minimal depression
*10–18:  indicates mild depression
*19–29:  indicates moderate depression
*30–63:  indicates severe depression.
Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.

Some items on the BDI have more than one statement marked with the same score. For instance, there are two responses under the Mood heading that score a ''2'': (2a) ''I am blue or sad all the time and I can't snap out of it'' and (2b) ''I am so sad or unhappy that it is very painful.''<ref name="Beck, A.T."/>

===BDI-IA===
The BDI-IA was a revision of the original instrument, developed by Beck during the 1970s and copyrighted in 1978. To improve [[ease of use]], the "''a'' and ''b'' statements" described above were removed, and respondents were instructed to endorse how they had been feeling during the preceding two weeks.<ref name=Moran&Lambert>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Moran PW, Lambert MJ |year=1983|contribution=A review of current assessment tools for monitoring changes in depression|editor= Lambert MS, Christensen ER and DeJulio S|title= The Assessment of Psychotherapy Outcomes|location= New York|publisher= Wiley}}</ref><ref name=BeckSteer>{{cite journal |author=Beck AT, Steer RA, Ball R, Ranieri W |title=Comparison of Beck Depression Inventories -IA and -II in psychiatric outpatients |journal=Journal of Personality Assessment |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=588–97 |year=1996 |month=December |pmid=8991972 |doi= 10.1207/s15327752jpa6703_13|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez |accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref> The [[internal consistency]] for the BDI-IA was good, with a [[Cronbach's alpha]] coefficient of around 0.85, meaning that the items on the inventory are highly correlated with each other.<ref name="pmid2005064">{{cite journal |author=Ambrosini PJ, Metz C, Bianchi MD, Rabinovich H, Undie A |title=Concurrent validity and psychometric properties of the Beck Depression Inventory in outpatient adolescents |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=51–7 |year=1991 |month=January |pmid=2005064 |doi= 10.1097/00004583-199101000-00008|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez |accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>

However, this version retained some flaws; the BDI-IA only addressed six out of the nine [[DSM-III]] criteria for depression. This and other criticisms were addressed in the BDI-II.

===BDI-II===
The BDI-II was a 1996 revision of the BDI,<ref name=BeckSteer/>  developed in response to the [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] publication of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], Fourth Edition, which changed many of the [[Diagnosis|diagnostic criteria]] for Major Depressive Disorder. 

Items involving changes in [[body image]], hypochondria, and difficulty working were replaced. Also, sleep loss and [[Anorexia (symptom)|appetite loss]] items were revised to assess both increases and decreases in sleep and appetite.  All but three of the items were reworded; only the items dealing with feelings of being punished, thoughts about suicide, and interest in sex remained the same. Finally, participants were asked to rate how they have been feeling for the past two weeks, as opposed to the past week as in the original BDI. 

Like the BDI, the BDI-II also contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. The cutoffs used differ from the original: 0–13: minimal depression; 14–19: mild depression; 20–28: moderate depression; and 29–63: severe depression. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. 

One measure of an instrument's usefulness is to see how closely it agrees with another similar instrument that has been validated against clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]] with a [[Pearson r]] of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown to have a high one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood.<ref name=Beck>Beck AT, Steer RA and Brown GK (1996) "Manual for the Beck Depression Inventory-II". San Antonio, TX: Psychological Corporation</ref> The test also has high internal consistency (α=.91).<ref name=BeckSteer/>

==Two-factor approach to depression==
Depression can be thought of as having two components: the affective component (e.g. mood) and the physical or "somatic" component (e.g. loss of appetite). The BDI-II reflects this and can be separated into two subscales. The purpose of the subscales is to help determine the primary cause of a patient's depression.

The affective subscale contains eight items: [[pessimism]], past failures, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal thoughts or wishes, and worthlessness. The somatic subscale consists of the other thirteen items: sadness, loss of pleasure, crying, agitation, loss of interest, indecisiveness, loss of energy, change in sleep patterns, irritability, change in appetite, concentration difficulties, tiredness and/or fatigue, and loss of interest in sex. The two subscales were moderately correlated at 0.57, suggesting that the physical and psychological aspects of depression are related rather than totally distinct.<ref name="pmid10100838">{{cite journal |author=Steer RA, Ball R, Ranieri WF, Beck AT |title=Dimensions of the Beck Depression Inventory-II in clinically depressed outpatients |journal=Journal of clinical psychology |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=117–28 |year=1999 |month=January |pmid=10100838|doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(199901)55:1<117::AID-JCLP12>3.0.CO;2-A}}</ref><ref name="pmid15129421">{{cite journal |author=Storch EA, Roberti JW, Roth DA |title=Factor structure, concurrent validity, and internal consistency of the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition in a sample of college students |journal=[[Depression and Anxiety]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=187–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15129421 |doi=10.1002/da.20002}}</ref>

==Impact==
The development of the BDI was an important event in [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]]; it represented a shift in health care professionals' view of depression from a [[Freudian]], psychodynamic perspective, to one guided by the patient's own thoughts or "cognitions".<ref name=McGrawHill /> It also established the principle that instead of attempting to develop a psychometric tool based on a possibly invalid theory, self-report questionnaires when analysed  using techniques such as [[factor analysis]] can suggest theoretical constructs.

The BDI was originally developed to provide a quantitative assessment of the intensity of depression. Because it is designed to reflect the depth of depression, it can monitor changes over time and provide an objective measure for judging improvement and the effectiveness or otherwise of treatment methods.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Beck AT, Ward C, Mendelson M|year=1961|title=Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)|journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry|volume=4|pages=561–571|pmid=13688369|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1961.01710120031004|issue=6}}

==Limitations==
The BDI suffers from the same problems as other [[self-report inventories]], in that scores can be easily exaggerated or minimized by the person completing them. Like all questionnaires, the way the instrument is administered can have an effect on the final score. If a patient is asked to fill out the form in front of other people in a clinical environment, for instance, social expectations have been shown to elicit a different response compared to administration via a postal survey.<ref name="pmid15870099">{{cite journal |author=Bowling A |title=Mode of questionnaire administration can have serious effects on data quality |journal=Journal of public health (Oxford, England) |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=281–91 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=15870099 |doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdi031 |url=http://jpubhealth.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15870099 |accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>

In participants with concomitant physical illness the BDI's reliance on physical symptoms such as fatigue may artificially inflate scores due to symptoms of the illness, rather than of depression.<ref name="pmid9851650">{{cite journal |author=Moore MJ, Moore PB, Shaw PJ |title=Mood disturbances in motor neurone disease |journal=Journal of the neurological sciences |volume=160 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S53–6 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9851650 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-510X(98)00203-2|url= }}</ref> In an effort to deal with this concern Beck and his colleagues developed the "Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care" (BDI-PC), a short screening scale consisting of seven items from the BDI-II considered to be independent of physical function. Unlike the standard BDI, the BDI-PC produces only a binary outcome of "not depressed" or "depressed" for patients above a cutoff score of 4.<ref name="pmid10228890">{{cite journal |author=Steer RA, Cavalieri TA, Leonard DM, Beck AT |title=Use of the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care to screen for major depression disorders |journal=General hospital psychiatry |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=106–11 |year=1999 |pmid=10228890 |doi= 10.1016/S0163-8343(98)00070-X|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0163-8343(98)00070-X |accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>

Although designed as a screening device rather than a diagnostic tool, the BDI is sometimes used by health care providers to reach a quick diagnosis.<ref>{{cite book|title=Adult Psychopathology and Diagnosis |author=Hersen M, Turner SM, Beidel DC|pages=301–302 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|edition=5th|isbn=978-0-471-74584-6|year=2007}}</ref>
