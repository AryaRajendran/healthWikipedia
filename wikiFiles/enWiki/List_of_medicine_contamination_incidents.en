*2007 Panamanian [[Eduardo Arias]] discovered that toothpaste sold in his country was labeled as containing [[diethylene glycol]], the same ingredient that had tainted cough syrup and killed 138 Panamanians in 2006.  Panamanian officials discovered that the toothpaste had come from China and initiated a global response.<ref>Bogdanich, W.; McLean,  R.

Fast action by the Ministry of Health, and notification through the media, prevented poisonings due to this product.  This event was linked to the death sentence of a former pharmaceuticals control officer in China, as the Costa Rican newspaper La Nación reported on its issue of May 30.<ref>China sentencia a muerte al exjefe de control de fármacos.

The tainted products could be identified by the claim to be manufactured in South Africa by Colgate-Palmolive South Africa LTD; they were 5oz/100ml tubes (a size which Colgate does not sell in the United States) and their packaging contained numerous misspellings on the labels. Colgate-Palmolive claimed that it does not import their products from South Africa into the United  States or Canada and that DEG is never and was never used in any of its products anywhere in the world. These counterfeit products were found in smaller [[mom and pop]] stores, dollar stores and discount stores in at least four states.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19214360/ Toothpaste labeled Colgate recalled - More health news - MSNBC.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In July 2007, diethylene glycol was found in counterfeit Sensodyne toothpaste, on sale at a car boot sale in Derbyshire, England,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/6896182.stm | work=BBC News | title=Toxin found in fake UK toothpaste | date=2007-07-12 | accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>
