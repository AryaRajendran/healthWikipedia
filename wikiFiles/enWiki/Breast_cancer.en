'''Breast cancer''' is a type of [[cancer]] originating from [[breast]] tissue, most commonly from the inner lining of [[lactiferous duct|milk ducts]] or the [[lobules]] that supply the ducts with milk.<ref>{{cite pmid|21265355}}</ref> Cancers originating from ducts are known as [[Mammary ductal carcinoma|ductal carcinomas]], while those originating from lobules are known as [[lobular carcinoma]]s. Breast cancer occurs in [[human]]s and other [[mammal]]s. While the overwhelming majority of human cases occur in women, [[male breast cancer]] can also occur.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/malebreastcancer.html US NIH: Male Breast Cancer]</ref>

<!-- Screening and treatment -->
The benefit versus harms of [[breast cancer screening]] is controversial. The characteristics of the cancer determine the treatment which may include [[surgery]], [[medications]] ([[hormonal therapy]] and [[chemotherapy]]), [[radiation]] and/or [[immunotherapy]].<ref name="PMC3031364">{{cite journal | author = Florescu A, Amir E, Bouganim N, Clemons M | title = Immune therapy for breast cancer in 2010—hype or hope? | journal = Current Oncology | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = e9–e18 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21331271 | pmc = 3031364 | doi =  }}</ref> Surgical provides the single largest benefit, and to increase the likelihood of cure, several [[chemotherapy regimen]]s are commonly given in addition.

<!-- Epidemiology -->
Worldwide, breast cancer accounts for 22.9% of all cancers (excluding non-melanoma [[skin cancer]]s) in women.<ref name="IARC GLOBOCAN 2008" /> In 2008, breast cancer caused 458,503 deaths worldwide (13.7% of cancer deaths in women).<ref name="IARC GLOBOCAN 2008">{{Cite web| publisher =[[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |year=2008 |title=World Cancer Report |url=http://globocan.iarc.fr/factsheets/populations/factsheet.asp?uno=900 |accessdate=2011-02-26}} (cancer statistics often exclude non-melanoma skin cancers such as [[basal cell carcinoma]], which are common but rarely fatal)</ref> Breast cancer is more than 100 times more common in women than [[male breast cancer|in men]], although men tend to have poorer outcomes due to delays in diagnosis.<ref name="WHO WCR" /><ref>{{Cite web | title = Male Breast Cancer Treatment | publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]] |year=2011 | url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/malebreast/HealthProfessional | accessdate = 2011-02-26}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:En Breast cancer illustrations.gif|thumb|Early signs of breast cancer]]
[[File:Breast cancer.jpg|thumb|Breast cancer showing an inverted nipple, lump and skin dimpling.]]

The first noticeable [[symptom]] of breast cancer is typically a [[breast lump|lump]] that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of breast cancer cases are discovered when the woman feels a lump.<ref name="merck">{{Cite web|author=[[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]] |month=February |year=2003 |title=Breast Disorders: Breast Cancer |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref> The earliest breast cancers are detected by a [[mammogram]].<ref name="acs cancer facts 2007"/> Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits<ref name="merck"/> can also indicate breast cancer.

Indications of breast cancer other than a lump may include thickening different from the other breast tissue, one breast becoming larger or lower, a nipple changing position or shape or becoming inverted, skin puckering or dimpling, a rash on or around a nipple, discharge from nipple/s, constant pain in part of the breast or armpit, and swelling beneath the armpit or around the collarbone.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Watson M | title = Assessment of suspected cancer | journal = InnoAiT | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 94–107 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1093/innovait/inn001 }}</ref> Pain ("[[mastodynia]]") is an unreliable tool in determining the presence or absence of breast cancer, but may be indicative of other [[breast health]] issues.<ref name="merck"/><ref name="acs cancer facts 2007">{{Cite web|author=American Cancer Society |year=2007 |title=Cancer Facts & Figures 2007|url=http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2007PWSecured.pdf|accessdate=2007-04-26|format=PDF|archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070410025934/http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2007PWSecured.pdf|archivedate = 10 April 2007}}</ref><ref name="eMed">{{Cite web|author=[[eMedicine]] |month=23 August, |year=2006 |title=Breast Cancer Evaluation |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC3287.HTM |accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref>

[[Inflammatory breast cancer]] is a particular type of breast cancer which can pose a substantial diagnostic challenge. Symptoms may resemble a breast inflammation and may include itching, pain, swelling, nipple inversion, warmth and redness throughout the breast, as well as an orange-peel texture to the skin referred to as ''peau d'orange'';<ref name="merck"/> the absence of a discernible lump delays detection dangerously.

Another reported symptom complex of breast cancer is [[Paget's disease of the breast]]. This [[syndrome]] presents as [[eczema]]toid skin changes such as redness and mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half of women diagnosed with Paget's also have a lump in the breast.<ref name="nci paget">{{Cite web|author=[[National Cancer Institute]] |month=27 June, |year=2005 |title=Paget's Disease of the Nipple: Questions and Answers |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/pagets-breast |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref>

In rare cases, what initially appears as a [[fibroadenoma]] (hard movable lump) could in fact be a [[phyllodes tumor|phyllodes]] tumor.  Phyllodes tumors are formed within the stroma  (connective tissue) of the breast and contain glandular  as well as stromal tissue. Phyllodes tumors are not staged in the usual sense; they are classified on the basis of their appearance under the microscope  as benign, borderline, or malignant.<ref name="phyllodes-tumor">

Occasionally, breast cancer presents as [[metastatic]] disease, that is, cancer that has spread beyond the original organ. [[Metastatic breast cancer]] will cause symptoms that depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung and brain.<ref name="pmid17158753">{{cite journal | author = Lacroix M | title = Significance, detection and markers of disseminated breast cancer cells | journal = Endocrine-related Cancer | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 1033–67 | year = 2006 | month = December | pmid = 17158753 | doi = 10.1677/ERC-06-0001 }}</ref> Unexplained weight loss can occasionally herald an occult breast cancer, as can symptoms of fevers or chills. Bone or joint pains can sometimes be manifestations of metastatic breast cancer, as can jaundice or neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called [[non-specific symptom|''non-specific'']], meaning they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.<ref name="nci metastatic">{{Cite web|author=[[National Cancer Institute]] |month=1 September, |year=2004 |title=Metastatic Cancer: Questions and Answers |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/metastatic |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref>

Most symptoms of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not turn out to represent underlying breast cancer. Less than 20% of lumps for example are cancer<ref>{{cite book|last=McCann]|first=[executive publisher, Judith A.

Nevertheless, the appearance of a new symptom should be taken seriously by both patients and their doctors, because of the possibility of an underlying breast cancer at almost any age.<ref name="merck breasts">{{Cite web|author=[[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]] |month=February |year=2003 |title=Breast Disorders: Overview of Breast Disorders |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/breast_disorders/overview_of_breast_disorders.html |accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Carcinogenesis}}
[[File:Signal transduction pathways.svg|thumb|Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in [[apoptosis]]. Mutations leading to loss of apoptosis can lead to tumorigenesis.]]
Breast cancer, like other [[cancers]], occurs because of an interaction between an environmental (external) factor and a genetically susceptible host. Normal cells divide as many times as needed and stop. They attach to other cells and stay in place in tissues. Cells become cancerous when they lose their ability to stop dividing, to attach to other cells, to stay where they belong, and to die at the proper time.

Normal cells will commit cell suicide ([[apoptosis]]) when they are no longer needed. Until then, they are protected from cell suicide by several protein clusters and pathways. One of the protective pathways is the [[PI3K]]/[[AKT]] pathway; another is the [[Ras (protein)|RAS]]/[[Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase|MEK]]/[[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]] pathway. Sometimes the genes along these protective pathways are mutated in a way that turns them permanently "on", rendering the cell incapable of committing suicide when it is no longer needed. This is one of the steps that causes cancer in combination with other mutations. Normally, the [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] protein turns off the PI3K/AKT pathway when the cell is ready for cell suicide. In some breast cancers, the gene for the PTEN protein is mutated, so the PI3K/AKT pathway is stuck in the "on" position, and the cancer cell does not commit suicide.<ref>{{Cite conference

In the United States, 10 to 20 percent of patients with breast cancer and patients with ovarian cancer have a first- or second-degree relative with one of these diseases.  The familial tendency to develop these cancers is called [[hereditary breast—ovarian cancer syndrome]].  The best known of these, the [[BRCA mutation]]s, confer a lifetime risk of breast cancer of between 60 and 85 percent and a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of between 15 and 40 percent.  Some mutations associated with cancer, such as ''[[p53]]'', ''[[BRCA1]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]'', occur in mechanisms to correct errors in DNA. These mutations are either inherited or acquired after birth. Presumably, they allow further mutations, which allow uncontrolled division, lack of attachment, and metastasis to distant organs.<ref name="acs bc facts 2005-6">{{Cite web|author=American Cancer Society |year=2005 |title=Breast Cancer Facts & Figures 2005–2006 |url=http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2005BrFacspdf2005.pdf |accessdate=2007-04-26|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070613192148/http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2005BrFacspdf2005.pdf |archivedate = 13 June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Dunning AM, Healey CS, Pharoah PD, Teare MD, Ponder BA, Easton DF | title = A systematic review of genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer risk | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 843–54 | year = 1999 | month = October | pmid = 10548311 | doi =  | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10548311 }}</ref> However there is strong evidence of residual risk variation that goes well beyond hereditary BRCA gene mutations between carrier families.

==Diagnosis==
Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of the biopsy. There are however, rarer types of breast cancer that require specialized lab exams.

While screening techniques are useful in determining the possibility of cancer, a further testing is necessary to confirm whether a lump detected on screening is cancer, as opposed to a benign alternative such as a simple cyst.

Very often the results of noninvasive examination, mammography and additional tests that are performed in special circumstances such as ultrasound or MR imaging are sufficient to warrant [[excisional biopsy]] as the definitive diagnostic and curative method.

Both mammography and clinical breast exam, also used for screening, can indicate an approximate likelihood that a lump is cancer, and may also detect some other lesions.<ref>{{cite pmid|15537576}}</ref> When the tests are inconclusive Fine Needle Aspiration and Cytology (FNAC) may be used which is a confirmatory test. FNAC may be done in a GP's office using local anaesthetic if required, involves attempting to extract a small portion of fluid from the lump. Clear fluid makes the lump highly unlikely to be cancerous, but bloody fluid may be sent off for inspection under a microscope for cancerous cells. Together, these three tools can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy.

Other options for biopsy include [[core biopsy]], where a section of the breast lump is removed, and an excisional biopsy, where the entire lump is removed.

In addition [[vacuum-assisted breast biopsy]] (VAB) may help diagnose breast cancer among patients with a mammographically detected breast in women.<ref name="pmid20130983">{{cite journal | author = Yu YH, Liang C, Yuan XZ | title = Diagnostic value of vacuum-assisted breast biopsy for breast carcinoma: a meta-analysis and systematic review. | journal = Breast cancer research and treatment | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 469–79 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20130983 | doi = 10.1007/s10549-010-0750-1 }}</ref>

===Classification===
{{Main| Breast cancer classification}}

Breast cancers are classified by several grading systems. Each of these influences the [[prognosis]] and can affect treatment response. Description of a breast cancer optimally includes all of these factors.

*  '''Histopathology'''. Breast cancer is usually classified primarily by its [[Breast cancer classification#Histopathology|histological]] appearance. Most breast cancers are derived from the epithelium lining the ducts or lobules, and these cancers are classified as [[mammary ductal carcinoma|ductal]] or lobular carcinoma. ''Carcinoma in situ'' is growth of low grade cancerous or precancerous cells within a particular tissue compartment such as the mammary duct without invasion of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, ''invasive carcinoma'' does not confine itself to the initial tissue compartment.<ref>[http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html Merck Manual, Professional Edition], Ch. 253, Breast Cancer.</ref>
* '''Grade'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|Grading]] compares the appearance of the breast cancer cells to the appearance of normal breast tissue.  Normal cells in an organ like the breast become differentiated, meaning that they take on specific shapes and forms that reflect their function as part of that organ. Cancerous cells lose that differentiation. In cancer, the cells that would normally line up in an orderly way to make up the milk ducts become disorganized. Cell division becomes uncontrolled. Cell nuclei become less uniform. Pathologists describe cells as well differentiated (low grade), moderately differentiated (intermediate grade), and poorly differentiated (high grade) as the cells progressively lose the features seen in normal breast cells. Poorly differentiated cancers (the ones whose tissue is least like normal breast tissue) have a worse prognosis.
*  '''Stage'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Staging|Breast cancer staging]] using the [[Breast cancer classification#TNM system|TNM system]] is based on the size of the <u>t</u>umor ('''T'''), whether or not the tumor has spread to the [[lymph node|lymph]] <u>n</u>odes ('''N''') in the armpits, and whether the tumor has <u>m</u>etastasized ('''M''') (i.e. spread to a more distant part of the body). Larger size, nodal spread, and metastasis have a larger stage number and a worse prognosis. <br />The main stages are:
**Stage 0 is a pre-cancerous or marker condition, either [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS) or [[lobular carcinoma in situ]] (LCIS).
**Stages 1–3 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.
**Stage 4 is [[Metastatic breast cancer|'metastatic' cancer]] that has a less favorable prognosis.
* '''Receptor status'''. Breast cancer cells have [[Breast cancer classification#Receptor status|receptors]] on their surface and in their [[cytoplasm]] and [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Chemical messengers such as [[hormone]]s bind to [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], and this causes changes in the cell. Breast cancer cells may or may not have three important receptors: [[estrogen receptor]] (ER), [[progesterone receptor]] (PR), and [[HER2/neu|HER2]]. <br />ER+ cancer cells depend on estrogen for their growth, so they can be treated with drugs to block estrogen effects (e.g. [[tamoxifen]]), and generally have a better prognosis. HER2+ breast cancer had a worse prognosis,<ref name="sotirou">{{cite journal | author = Sotiriou C, Pusztai L | title = Gene-expression signatures in breast cancer | journal = N. Engl. J.

In cases of breast cancer with low risk for metastasis, the risks associated with [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], or [[Bone scintigraphy|bone scans]] outweigh the possible benefits.<ref name="ASCOfive">{{Citation |author1 = American Society of Clinical Oncology |author1-link = American Society of Clinical Oncology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url =http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |accessdate = 14 August 2012}}</ref><ref name="CarlsonBreast">{{cite PMID|19200416}}</ref>  This is because these procedures expose the patient to a substantial amount of potentially dangerous ionizing radiation.

*'''DNA assays'''.  [[Breast cancer classification#DNA classification|DNA testing]] of various types including [[DNA microarrays]] have compared normal cells to breast cancer cells.  The specific changes in a particular breast cancer can be used to classify the cancer in several ways, and may assist in choosing the most effective treatment for that DNA type.

==Prevention==
Women may reduce their risk of breast cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, drinking less alcohol, being physically active and breastfeeding their children.<ref name=WCRF2007>[[Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective]]; American Institute for Cancer Research/ World Cancer Research Fund, http://www.dietandcancerreport.org</ref> These modifications might prevent 38% of breast cancers in the US, 42% in the UK, 28% in Brazil and 20% in China.<ref name=WCRF2007/> The benefits with moderate [[exercise]] such as brisk walking  are seen at all age groups including postmenopausal women.<ref name=WCRF2007/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Eliassen AH, Hankinson SE, Rosner B, Holmes MD, Willett WC | title = Physical activity and risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women | journal = Arch.

==Screening==
{{Main|Breast cancer screening}}
Breast cancer screening refers to testing otherwise-healthy women for breast cancer in an attempt to achieve an earlier diagnosis under the assumption that early detection will improve outcomes. A number of screening test have been employed including: clinical and self [[breast exams]], [[mammography]], genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.

A clinical or self [[breast exam]] involves feeling the breast for [[breast lump|lumps]] or other abnormalities. Clinical breast exams are performed by health care providers, while self breast exams are performed by the person themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Screening|url=http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/screening.htm|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> Evidence dose not support the effectiveness of either type of breast exam, as by the time a lump is large enough to be found it is likely to have been growing for several years and thus soon be large enough to be found without an exam.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kösters JP, Gøtzsche PC|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|issue=2|pages = CD003373|year=2003|pmid = 12804462|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003373}}</ref><ref name=USPSTFScreen2009/> Mammographic screening for breast cancer uses [[X-ray]]s to examine the breast for any uncharacteristic masses or lumps. During a screening, the breast is compressed and a technician takes photos from multiple angles. A general mammogram takes photos of the entire breast, while a diagnostic mammogram focuses on a specific lump or area of concern.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breast Cancer and Mammograms|url=http://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/guide/mammograms|work=WebMD|accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref>

A number of national bodies continue to recommend breast cancer screening. For the average woman, the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] recommends mammography every two years in women between the ages of 50 and 74,<ref name=USPSTFScreen2009/> the [[Council of Europe]] recommends mammography between 50 and 69 with most programs using a 2 year frequency,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Biesheuvel|first=C|coauthors=Weigel, S; Heindel, W|title=Mammography Screening: Evidence, History and Current Practice in Germany and Other European Countries.|journal=Breast care (Basel, Switzerland)|date=2011|volume=6|issue=2|pages=104-109|pmid=21673820}}</ref> and in Canada screening is recommended between the ages of 50 and 74 at a frequency of 2 to 3 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health|first=Care|coauthors=Tonelli, M; Gorber, SC; Joffres, M; Dickinson, J; Singh, H; Lewin, G; Birtwhistle, R; Fitzpatrick-Lewis, D; Hodgson, N; Ciliska, D; Gauld, M; Liu, YY|title=Recommendations on screening for breast cancer in average-risk women aged 40-74 years.|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne|date=2011 Nov 22|volume=183|issue=17|pages=1991–2001|pmid=22106103|doi=10.1503/cmaj.110334|pmc=3225421}}</ref> These task force reports point out that in addition to unnecessary surgery and anxiety, the risks of more frequent mammograms include a small but significant increase in breast cancer induced by radiation.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/3rduspstf/breastCancer/brcanrr.htm#ref31|title=Breast Cancer: Screening|work=United States Preventive Services Task Force|accessdate=}}</ref> Whether MRI as a screening method has greater harms or benefits when compared to standard mammography is not known.<ref name=USPSTFScreen2009>{{cite web|title=Screening for Breast Cancer|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsbrca.htm|work=US Preventative Services Task Force|accessdate=24 December 2012|date=December 2009}}</ref>

==Management==
{{Main|Breast cancer management}}
The management of breast cancer depending on various factors, including the stage of the cancer. Breast cancer is usually treated with [[surgery]] and then possibly with chemotherapy or radiation, or both. A multidisciplinary approach is preferable.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Saini KS, Taylor C, Ramirez AJ, et al | title = Role of the multidisciplinary team in breast cancer management: results from a large international survey involving 39 countries | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 853–9 | year = 2011, August | pmid = 21821551 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdr352 }}</ref> Hormone positive cancers are treated with long term hormone blocking therapy. Treatments are given with increasing aggressiveness according to the prognosis and risk of recurrence.

===Surgery===
[[File:Mastectomie 02.jpg|thumb|Chest after right breast [[mastectomy]]]]
Surgery involves the physical removal of the tumor, typically along with some of the surrounding tissue and frequently [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsy.

Standard surgeries include:
* [[Mastectomy]]: Removal of the whole breast.
* [[Quadrantectomy]]: Removal of one quarter of the breast.
* [[Lumpectomy]]: Removal of a small part of the breast.
If the patient desires, then [[breast reconstruction surgery]], a type of [[cosmetic surgery]], may be performed to create an aesthetic appearance.
In other cases, women use [[breast prostheses]] to simulate a breast under clothing, or choose a flat chest. [[Nipple prosthesis|Nipple/areola prostheses]] can be used at any time following the mastectomy.

===Medication===
Drugs used after and in addition to surgery are called [[adjuvant cancer therapy|adjuvant therapy]]. Chemotherapy or other types of therapy prior to surgery are called [[neoadjuvant therapy]].

There are currently three main groups of medications used for adjuvant breast cancer treatment:  hormone blocking therapy, chemotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies.

;[[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|Hormone blocking therapy]]
:Some breast cancers require estrogen to continue growing. They can be identified by the presence of estrogen receptors (ER+) and progesterone receptors (PR+) on their surface (sometimes referred to together as hormone receptors). These ER+ cancers can be treated with drugs that either block the receptors, e.g. [[tamoxifen]] (Nolvadex), or alternatively block the production of estrogen with an [[aromatase inhibitor]], e.g. [[anastrozole]] (Arimidex)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ting Bao, Michelle A Rudek | title = The Clinical Pharmacology of Anastrozole | journal = European Oncology & Haematology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 106–8 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | doi =  | url = http://www.touchoncology.com/articles/clinical-pharmacology-anastrozole }}</ref> or [[letrozole]] (Femara). Aromatase inhibitors, however, are only suitable for post-menopausal patients. This is because the active aromatase in postmenopausal women is different from the prevalent form in premenopausal women, and therefore these agents are ineffective in inhibiting the predominant aromatase of premenopausal women.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Petit T, Dufour P, Tannock I | title = A critical evaluation of the role of aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with breast cancer | journal = Endocr.

;[[Chemotherapy]]
:Predominately used for stage 2–4 disease, being particularly beneficial in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) disease. They are given in combinations, usually for 3–6 months. One of the most common treatments is cyclophosphamide plus [[doxorubicin]] (Adriamycin), known as AC. Most chemotherapy medications work by destroying fast-growing and/or fast-replicating cancer cells either by causing DNA damage upon replication or other mechanisms; these drugs also damage fast-growing normal cells where they cause serious side effects. Damage to the heart muscle is the most dangerous complication of doxorubicin. Sometimes a taxane drug, such as docetaxel, is added, and the regime is then known as CAT; taxane attacks the microtubules in cancer cells. Another common treatment, which produces equivalent results, is cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF). (Chemotherapy can literally refer to any drug, but it is usually used to refer to traditional non-hormone treatments for cancer.){{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
;[[Monoclonal antibodies]]
:[[Trastuzumab]] (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody to HER2, has improved the 5-year disease free survival of stage 1–3 HER2+ breast cancers to about 87% (overall survival 95%).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jahanzeb M | title = Adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer | journal = Clin.

==Prognosis==
[[File:RecurrentbreastCA1.gif|thumb|An example of recurrent breast cancer]]
A prognosis is a prediction of outcome and the probability of progression-free survival (PFS) or disease-free survival (DFS). These predictions are based on experience with breast cancer patients with similar classification. A prognosis is an estimate, as patients with the same classification will survive a different amount of time, and classifications are not always precise. Survival is usually calculated as an average number of months (or years) that 50% of patients survive, or the percentage of patients that are alive after 1, 5, 15, and 20 years. Prognosis is important for treatment decisions because patients with a good prognosis are usually offered less invasive treatments, such as lumpectomy and radiation or hormone therapy, while patients with poor prognosis are usually offered more aggressive treatment, such as more extensive mastectomy and one or more chemotherapy drugs.

Prognostic factors are reflected in the [[Breast cancer classification|classification scheme for breast cancer]] including [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|stage]], (i.e., tumor size, location, whether disease has spread to [[lymph node]]s and other parts of the body), [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|grade]], recurrence of the disease, and the age and health of the patient.  The [[Nottingham Prognostic Index]] is a commonly used prognostic tool.

The [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|stage]] of the breast cancer is the most important component of traditional classification methods of breast cancer, because it has a greater effect on the prognosis than the other considerations. Staging takes into consideration size, local involvement, lymph node status and whether metastatic disease is present. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the poorer the prognosis. The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis with a 10yr disease free survival of about 98%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |title=Breast Cancer: Breast Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |publisher=Merck.com |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>

[[Breast cancer classification#Grade|The breast cancer grade]] is assessed by comparison of the breast cancer cells to normal breast cells. The closer to normal the cancer cells are, the slower their growth and the better the prognosis. If cells are not well differentiated, they will appear immature, will divide more rapidly, and will tend to spread. Well differentiated is given a grade of 1, moderate is grade 2, while poor or undifferentiated is given a higher grade of 3 or 4 (depending upon the scale used). The most widely used grading system is the Nottingham scheme;<ref>{{cite journal | author = Elston CW, Ellis IO | title = Pathological prognostic factors in breast cancer. I.

The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the cancer cell is important in guiding treatment. Those who do not test positive for these specific receptors will not be able to respond to [[hormone therapy]], and this can affect their chance of survival depending upon what treatment options remain, the exact type of the cancer, and how advanced the disease is.

In addition to hormone receptors, there are other cell surface proteins that may affect prognosis and treatment. HER2 status directs the course of treatment. Patients whose cancer cells are positive for HER2 have more aggressive disease and may be treated with the 'targeted therapy', trastuzumab (Herceptin), a [[monoclonal antibody]] that targets this protein and improves the prognosis significantly.

Younger women tend to have a poorer prognosis than post-menopausal women due to several factors. Their breasts are active with their cycles, they may be nursing infants, and may be unaware of changes in their breasts. Therefore, younger women are usually at a more advanced stage when diagnosed. There may also be biologic factors contributing to a higher risk of disease recurrence for younger women with breast cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Peppercorn J | title = Breast Cancer in Women Under 40 | journal = Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages =  | year = 2009 | pmid =  | doi =  | url = http://www.cancernetwork.com/cme/article/10165/1413886 }}</ref>

High mammographic breast density, which is a marker of increased risk of developing breast cancer, may not mean an increased risk of death among breast cancer patients, according to a 2012 report of a study involving 9232 women by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gierach|first=GL|coauthors=et al|title=Relationship between mammographic density and breast cancer death in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium|journal=Journal of National Cancer Institute|year=2012|month=August|doi=10.1093/jnci/djs327|pmid=22911616|volume=104|issue=16|pages=1218–27}}</ref> 

Since breast cancer in males is usually detected at later stages outcome are typically worse.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Judith|title=Differences in male breast cancer stage, tumor size at diagnosis, and survival rate between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions|url=http://udini.proquest.com/view/differences-in-male-breast-cancer-goid:739962564/|publisher=Proquest|accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>

===Psychological aspects===
The emotional impact of cancer diagnosis, symptoms, treatment, and related issues can be severe. Most larger hospitals are associated with [[cancer support group]]s which provide a supportive environment to help patients cope and gain perspective from cancer survivors. Online cancer support groups are also very beneficial to cancer patients, especially in dealing with uncertainty and body-image problems inherent in cancer treatment.

Not all breast cancer patients experience their illness in the same manner. Factors such as age can have a significant impact on the way a patient copes with a breast cancer diagnosis. Premenopausal women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer must confront the issues of early [[menopause]] induced by many of the chemotherapy regimens used to treat their breast cancer, especially those that use hormones to counteract ovarian function.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pritchard KI | title = Ovarian Suppression/Ablation in Premenopausal ER-Positive Breast Cancer Patients | journal = Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages =  | year = 2009 | pmid =  | doi =  | url = http://www.cancernetwork.com/display/article/10165/1366719?pageNumber=1 }}</ref>

On the other hand, a small 2007 study conducted by researchers at the College of Public Health of the University of Georgia suggested a need for greater attention to promoting functioning and psychological well-being among older cancer survivors, even when they may not have obvious cancer-related medical complications.<ref name="pmid17188505"/>  The study found that older breast cancer survivors showed multiple indications of decrements in their health-related quality of life, and lower psychosocial well-being than a comparison group.  Survivors reported no more depressive symptoms or anxious mood than the comparison group, however, they did  score lower in measures of positive psychosocial well-being, and reported more depressed mood and days affected by fatigue.  As the incidence of breast cancer in women over 50 rises and survival rates increase, breast cancer is increasingly becoming a geriatric issue that warrants both further research and the expansion of specialized cancer support services tailored for specific age groups.<ref name="pmid17188505">{{cite journal | author = Robb C, Haley WE, Balducci L, ''et al.'' | title = Impact of breast cancer survivorship on quality of life in older women | journal = Critical Reviews in Oncology/hematology | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–91 | year = 2007 | month = April | pmid = 17188505 | doi = 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2006.11.003 }}</ref>

Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women.  (The most common form of cancer is non-invasive [[Skin neoplasm|non-melanoma skin cancer]]; non-invasive cancers are generally easily cured, cause very few deaths, and are routinely excluded from cancer statistics.)  Breast cancer comprises 22.9% of invasive cancers in women<ref name="IARC GLOBOCAN 2008" /> and 16% of all female cancers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/cancer/detection/breastcancer/en/index1.html |title=Breast cancer: prevention and control |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=}}</ref>

In 2008, breast cancer caused 458,503 deaths worldwide (13.7% of cancer deaths in women and 6.0% of all cancer deaths for men and women together).<ref name="IARC GLOBOCAN 2008" />  [[Lung cancer]], the second most common cause of cancer-related death in women, caused 12.8% of cancer deaths in women (18.2% of all cancer deaths for men and women together).<ref name="IARC GLOBOCAN 2008" />

The incidence of breast cancer varies greatly around the world: it is lowest in less-developed countries and greatest in the more-developed countries. In the twelve world regions, the annual age-standardized [[incidence rate]]s per 100,000 women are as follows: in Eastern Asia, 18; South Central Asia, 22; sub-Saharan Africa, 22; South-Eastern Asia, 26; North Africa and Western Asia, 28; South and Central America, 42; Eastern Europe, 49; Southern Europe, 56; Northern Europe, 73; Oceania, 74; Western Europe, 78; and in North America, 90.<ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/2350813/World-Cancer-Report-2003-Stuart-e-Kleihues-WHO-e-IARC Stewart B.

Breast cancer, however, could be felt through the skin, and in its advanced state often developed into [[fungating lesion]]s:  the tumor would become [[necrotic]] (die from the inside, causing the tumor to appear to break up) and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerate]] through the skin, weeping fetid, dark fluid.<ref name=Olson9 />

The oldest description of cancer was discovered in Egypt and dates back to approximately 1600 BC. The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] describes 8 cases of tumors or ulcers of the breast that were treated by [[cauterization]]. The writing says about the disease, "There is no treatment."<ref>{{Cite web

Because ancient medicine believed that the cause was systemic, rather than local, and because surgery carried a high mortality rate, the preferred treatments tended to be pharmacological rather than surgical.  Herbal and mineral preparations, especially involving the poison [[arsenic]], were relatively common.

Mastectomy for breast cancer was performed at least as early as AD 548, when it was proposed by the court physician [[Aetios of Amida]] to [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Theodora]].<ref name=Olson9 />  It was not until doctors achieved greater understanding of the circulatory system in the 17th century that they could link breast cancer's spread to the [[lymph nodes]] in the armpit. The French surgeon [[Jean Louis Petit]] (1674–1750) and later the Scottish surgeon [[Benjamin Bell]] (1749–1806) were the first to remove the lymph nodes, breast tissue, and underlying chest muscle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/029cancer.html |title=History of Breast Cancer |publisher=Random History |date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>

Their successful work was carried on by [[William Stewart Halsted]] who started performing [[radical mastectomies]] in 1882, helped greatly by advances in general surgical technology, such as [[aseptic technique]] and [[anesthesia]]. The Halsted radical mastectomy often involved removing both breasts, associated lymph nodes, and the underlying chest muscles. This often led to long-term pain and disability, but was seen as necessary in order to prevent the cancer from recurring.<ref name=Olson102 /> Before the advent of the Halsted radical mastectomy, 20-year survival rates were only 10%; Halsted's surgery raised that rate to 50%.<ref name=Olson1>{{harvnb|Olson|2002|p=1}}</ref>  Extending Halsted's work, [[Jerome Urban]] promoted superradical mastectomies, taking even more tissue, until 1963, when the ten-year survival rates proved equal to the less-damaging radical mastectomy.<ref name=Olson102>{{harvnb|Olson|2002|pp=102–6}}</ref>

Radical mastectomies remained the standard of care in America until the 1970s, but in Europe, breast-sparing procedures, often followed radiation therapy, were generally adopted in the 1950s.<ref name=Olson102 />  One reason for this striking difference in approach may be the structure of the medical professions:  European surgeons, descended from the [[barber surgeon]], were held in less esteem than [[physicians]]; in America, the surgeon was the king of the medical profession.<ref name=Olson102 />  Additionally, there were far more European women surgeons:  Less than one percent of American surgical oncologists were female, but some European breast cancer wards boasted a medical staff that was half female.<ref name=Olson102 />  American health insurance companies also paid surgeons more to perform radical mastectomies than they did to perform more intricate breast-sparing surgeries.<ref name=Olson102 />

Breast cancer staging systems were developed in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=Olson102 />

During the 1970s, a new understanding of [[metastasis]] led to perceiving cancer as a systemic illness as well as a localized one, and more sparing procedures were developed that proved equally effective.  Modern [[chemotherapy]] developed after [[World War II]].<ref name=Lax>{{cite book

The French surgeon [[Bernard Peyrilhe]] (1737–1804) realized the first experimental transmission of cancer by injecting extracts of breast cancer into an animal.

==Society and culture==
{{Main|Breast cancer awareness}}

Before the 20th century, breast cancer was feared and discussed in hushed tones, as if it were shameful.  As little could be safely done with primitive surgical techniques, women tended to suffer silently rather than seeking care.  When surgery advanced, and long-term survival rates improved, women began [[raising awareness]] of the disease and the possibility of successful treatment.  The "Women's Field Army", run by the American Society for the Control of Cancer (later the [[American Cancer Society]]) during the 1930s and 1940s was one of the first organized campaigns. In 1952, the first peer-to-peer support group, called "Reach to Recovery", began providing post-mastectomy, in-hospital visits from women who had survived breast cancer.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=37–38}}</ref>

The [[breast cancer movement]] of the 1980s and 1990s developed out of the larger [[feminist movement]]s and women's health movement of the 20th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|p=4}}</ref>  This series of political and educational campaigns, partly inspired by the politically and socially effective [[AIDS]] awareness campaigns, resulted in the widespread acceptance of second opinions before surgery, less invasive surgical procedures, support groups, and other advances in patient care.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crcfl.net/content/view/history-of-breast-cancer-advocacy.html |title=History of Breast Cancer Advocacy > Personal Reflections > Bob Riter's Cancer Columns > Cancer Resource Center |publisher=Crcfl.net |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>

===Pink ribbon===
[[File:Pink ribbon.svg|uprighcast|150px|thumb|The [[pink ribbon]] is a symbol to show support for breast cancer awareness]]
{{Main|Pink ribbon}}

A [[pink ribbon]] is the most prominent symbol of breast cancer awareness. Pink ribbons, which can be made inexpensively, are sometimes sold as fundraisers, much like [[Poppy_day#Poppies|poppies on Remembrance Day]].  They may be worn to honor those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, or to identify products that the manufacturer would like to sell to consumers that are interested in breast cancer—usually white, middle-aged, middle-class and upper-class, educated women.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=27–72}}</ref>

The pink ribbon is associated with individual generosity, faith in scientific progress, and a "can-do" attitude.  It encourages consumers to focus on the emotionally appealing ultimate vision of a cure for breast cancer, rather than on the fraught path between current knowledge and any future cures.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=359–361}}</ref>

Wearing or displaying a pink ribbon has been criticized by the opponents of this practice as a kind of [[slacktivism]], because it has no practical positive effect and as [[hypocrisy]] among those who wear the pink ribbon to show good will towards women with breast cancer, but then oppose these women's practical goals, like [[patient rights]] and anti-pollution legislation.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|pp=366–8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web

===Breast cancer culture===
Breast cancer culture, or pink ribbon culture, is the set of activities, attitudes, and values that surround and shape breast cancer in public. The dominant values are selflessness, cheerfulness, unity, and optimism.  Appearing to have suffered bravely is the passport into the culture.

The woman with breast cancer is given a cultural template that constrains her emotional and social responses into a socially acceptable discourse:  She is to use the emotional trauma of being diagnosed with breast cancer and the suffering of extended treatment to transform herself into a stronger, happier and more sensitive person who is grateful for the opportunity to become a better person.  Breast cancer therapy becomes a [[rite of passage]] rather than a disease.<ref name=Ehrenreich>{{Cite news

Anger, sadness and negativity must be silenced.<ref name=Ehrenreich /> 

As with most cultural models, people who conform to the model are given social status, in this case as [[cancer survivor]]s.  Women who reject the model are shunned, punished and shamed.<ref name=Ehrenreich />

The culture is criticized for treating adult women like little girls, as evidenced by "baby" toys such as pink [[teddy bear]]s given to adult women.<ref name=Ehrenreich />

The primary purposes or goals of breast cancer culture are to maintain breast cancer's dominance as the preëminent women's health issue, to promote the appearance that society is "doing something" effective about breast cancer, and to sustain and expand the social, political, and financial power of breast cancer activists.<ref>{{harvnb|Sulik|2010|p=57}}</ref>

===Overemphasis===
Compared to other diseases or other cancers, breast cancer receives a disproportionate share of resources and attention. In 2001 MP [[Ian Gibson (politician)|Ian Gibson]], chairman of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] all party group on cancer stated "The treatment has been skewed by the [[lobbying]], there is no doubt about that. Breast cancer sufferers get better treatment in terms of bed spaces, facilities and doctors and nurses."<ref name="Browne">{{cite news

Some subjects, such as [[cancer-related fatigue]], have been studied in little except women with breast cancer.

One result of breast cancer's high visibility is that statistical results can sometimes be misinterpreted, such as the claim that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lives—a claim that depends on the unrealistic assumption that no woman will die of any other disease before the age of 95.<ref name=Olson199>{{harvnb|Olson|2002|pp=199–200}}</ref>  This obscures the reality, which is that about ten times as many women will die from [[heart disease]] or [[stroke]] than from breast cancer.<ref>{{cite news

According to H. Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, research on screening mammography has taken the "brain-dead approach that says the best test is the one that finds the most cancers" rather than the one that finds dangerous cancers.<ref name=Ave />

== In pregnancy ==
Cancers found during or shortly after pregnancy appear at approximately the same rate as other cancers in women of a similar age.  As a result, breast cancer is one of the more common cancers found during pregnancy, although it is still rare, because only about 1 in 1,000 pregnant women experience any sort of cancer.<ref name=yarbro />

Diagnosing a new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult, in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy.<ref name=yarbro /> As a result, cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average in many pregnant or recently pregnant women. Some imaging procedures, such as [[MRI]]s (magnetic resonance imaging), [[CT scan]]s, ultrasounds, and [[mammogram]]s with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy; some others, such as [[PET scan]]s are not.<ref name=yarbro />

Treatment is generally the same as for non-pregnant women.<ref name=yarbro /> However, radiation is normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cGy. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries to speed the start of treatment are not uncommon. Surgery is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but some other treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the [[first trimester]], increase the risk of [[birth defect]]s and [[pregnancy loss]] (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths).<ref name=yarbro />  Elective [[abortion]]s are not required and do not improve the likelihood of the mother surviving or being cured.<ref name=yarbro />

Radiation treatments may interfere with the mother's ability to breastfeed her baby because it reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of [[mastitis]]. Also, when chemotherapy is being given after birth, many of the drugs pass through breast milk to the baby, which could harm the baby.<ref name=yarbro>{{cite book

==Research==
A considerable part of the current knowledge on breast carcinomas is based on in vivo and in vitro studies performed with breast cancer cell (BCC) lines. These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating material, free of contaminating stromal cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard media. The first line described, BT-20, was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture BCC from primary tumors have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumor cells from their surrounding stroma. Most of the available BCC lines issued from metastatic tumors, mainly from [[pleural effusion]]s. Effusions provided generally large numbers of dissociated, viable tumor cells with little or no contamination by fibroblasts and other tumor stroma cells.
Many of the currently used BCC lines were established in the late 1970s. A very few of them, namely [[MCF-7]], T-47D, and MDA-MB-231, account for more than two-thirds of all abstracts reporting studies on mentioned BCC lines, as concluded from a [[Medline]]-based survey.

Treatments are constantly evaluated in randomized, controlled trials, to evaluate and compare individual drugs, combinations of drugs, and surgical and radiation techniques. The latest research is reported annually at scientific meetings such as that of the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]], San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium,<ref>[http://www.sabcs.org/EnduringMaterials/Index.asp San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium] Abstracts, newsletters, and other reports of the meeting.</ref> and the St. Gallen Oncology Conference in St. Gallen, Switzerland.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goldhirsch A, Ingle JN, Gelber RD, Coates AS, Thürlimann B, Senn HJ | title = Thresholds for therapies: highlights of the St Gallen International Expert Consensus on the primary therapy of early breast cancer 2009 | journal = Ann.

NFAT transcription factors are implicated in breast cancer, more specifically in the process of cell motility at the basis of metastasis formation.
