===Ancient to early modern history===
* In [[ancient Rome]], the architectural feature called a ''[[vomitorium]]'' was the entranceway through which crowds entered and exited a stadium, not a special room used for purging food during meals.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKeown|first=J.C.|title=A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities: Strange Tales and Surprising Facts from the World’s Greatest Empire|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-539375-9, 9780195393750|pages=153–154|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YGYwlMZ3ursC&pg=PA153&dq=vomitorium+misconception#v=onepage&q=vomitorium%20misconception&f=false|ref=harv}}</ref> Vomiting was not a regular part of [[Ancient Roman cuisine#Table culture|Roman dining customs]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fass|first=Patrick|title=Around the Roman Table|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-23347-5|pages=66–67|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YXGlAr17oekC&dq=romans+vomiting+meals+inpublisher%3Auniversity&q=vomiting+%22there+is+no+reason+to+believe%22#v=snippet&q=vomiting%20%22there%20is%20no%20reason%20to%20believe%22&f=false|ref=harv}}</ref>
* [[Nero]] did not "fiddle" during the [[Great Fire of Rome]] (violins had not yet been invented, nor was he playing the [[lyre]]). In fact, according to Roman historian [[Tacitus]], upon hearing news of the fire, Nero rushed back to Rome to organize a relief effort, which he paid for from his own funds, and he also opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless, arranging for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors.<ref name="annals-xv-39">{{cite book|last= Tacitus|title=Annals|ref=harv}} [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#39|XV.39]]</ref> Finally, he made a new urban development plan that attempted to make it more difficult for fires to spread.<ref>{{cite book|last= Tacitus|title=Annals|ref=harv}} [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#43|XV.43]]</ref>
* It is true that [[life expectancy]] in the Middle Ages and earlier was low; however, many take this to mean that people usually died around the age of 30.<ref>{{cite web|last=Laden |first=Greg |url=http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/05/01/falsehood-if-this-was-the-ston/ |title=Falsehood: "If this was the Stone Age, I’d be dead by now" – Greg Laden's Blog |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |date=2011-05-01 |accessdate=2012-12-23 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/SIMM |archivedate=2012-12-16 |deadurl=no}}</ref> In fact, the low life expectancy is an average based on high infant mortality, and the usual lifespan of adults was much higher.

* There is no evidence that [[Iron maiden (torture)|iron maiden]]s were invented in the [[Middle Ages]] or even used for torture. Instead they were pieced together in the 18th century from several [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] found in museums in order to create spectacular objects intended for (commercial) exhibition.<ref>{{cite book| first = Wolfgang| last = Schild| year = 2000| title = Die eiserne Jungfrau.

* The [[plate armor]] of European soldiers did not stop soldiers from moving around or necessitate a crane to get them into a saddle. They would as a matter of course fight on foot and could mount and dismount without help. In fact soldiers equipped with plate armor were more mobile than those with [[Mail (armour)|chainmail armor]], as chainmail was heavier and required stiff padding beneath due to its pliable nature.<ref>{{cite web|last=Breiding|first=Dirk|title=Department of Arms and Armor, The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aams/hd_aams.htm#weight_b|publisher=metmuseum.org|accessdate=February 23, 2012|ref=harv |archiveurl=http://archive.is/Ma2s |archivedate=2012-08-04 |deadurl=no}}</ref>
* Modern historians dispute the popular misconception that the [[chastity belt]], a device designed to prevent women from having [[sexual intercourse]], was invented in [[medieval]] times. Most existing chastity belts are now thought to be deliberate fakes or anti-masturbatory devices from the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The latter were made due to the [[History of masturbation#Health concerns|widespread belief that masturbation could lead to insanity]], and were mostly bought by parents for their teenage children.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keyser|first=Linda Migl|title=Misconceptions About the Middle Ages|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|chapter=The Medieval Chastity Belt Unbuckled|editor-last=Harris|editor-first= Stephen J.|editor2-last= Grigsby|editor2-first= Bryon L.|ref=have}}</ref>
* [[Christopher Columbus]]'s efforts to obtain support for his voyages were not hampered by a European belief in a [[flat Earth]]. Sailors and [[navigator]]s of the time knew that the [[spherical Earth|Earth was roughly spherical]], but (correctly) disagreed with Columbus's estimate of the distance to [[India]], which was approximately one-sixth of the actual distance. If the Americas did not exist, and had Columbus continued to India, he would have run out of supplies before reaching it at the rate he was traveling. Without the ability to determine [[longitude]] at sea, he wouldn't have learned that his estimate was an error in time to return. Many of the educated classes believed the Earth was spherical since the works of the Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle.<ref name="dicks">{{Cite book|last=Dicks|first=D.R.|title=Early Greek Astronomy to Aristotle|page=68|year=1970|isbn=978-0-8014-0561-7|publisher=Cornell University Press.|location=Ithaca, NY}}</ref><ref name="aquinas">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1001.htm#1|accessdate=July 31, 2010|title=Summa Theologica Question 1|last=Aquinas|first=St Thomas |archiveurl=http://archive.is/26sb9 |archivedate=2013-01-13 |deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Eratosthenes]] made an accurate estimate of the Earth's diameter in approximately 240 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276 B.C.-194 B.C.)|url=http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/eratosthenes-cyrene-276-b-c-194-b-c|publisher=enotes|accessdate=April 5, 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/C8jh |archivedate=2012-07-28 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/previews/panama-veraguas-province-preview.pdf |title=Panama – Veraguas Province |publisher=LonelyPlanet.com |page=174 |accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stengle|first=Jamie|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/health_science/daily/20080220_Lunar_eclipse__The_view_from_historys_perspective.html|title=Lunar eclipse: The view from history's perspective|publisher=Philly.com |date=February 20, 2008 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/Y1Im |archivedate=2012-05-27 |deadurl=no}}</ref> See also [[Myth of the Flat Earth]].

* Columbus did not "discover America" in the sense of identifying a new continent. Although some historians argue he knew he had found a land between Europe and Asia,<ref>Sale, Kirkpatrick (1991). ''The Conquest of Paradise: Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy''. ISBN 978-1-84511-154-0. pp. 204–209</ref> most of his writings show he thought he reached the eastern coast of Asia.<ref name="Zeruvabel2003">{{cite book | title=Terra cognita: the mental discovery of America | author1=Eviatar Zerubavel | publisher=Transaction Publishers | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-7658-0987-2 | pages=90–91 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YkLCiKN0x4UC&pg=PA90}}</ref>  Most of the landings Columbus made on [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|his four voyages]], including the initial October 12, 1492 landing (the anniversary of which forms the basis of [[Columbus Day]]), were in the Caribbean Islands. Columbus was not the first European to visit the Americas: at least one explorer, [[Leif Ericson]], preceded him by reaching what today is believed to be [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and Newfoundland was already a popular fishing site for the European powers by the time of Columbus.
* There is a legend that [[Marco Polo]] imported pasta from China<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilovepasta.org/faqs.html |title=National Pasta Association |archiveurl=http://archive.is/uiFe2 |archivedate=2011-07-26 |deadurl=no}} article ''FAQs'' section "Who "invented" pasta?"; "The story that it was Marco Polo who imported noodles to Italy and thereby gave birth to the country's pasta culture is the most pervasive myth in the history of Italian food."

Serventi, F. Sabban ''La pasta. Storia e cultura di un cibo universale'', VII. Economica Laterza 2004</ref> Marco Polo describes a food similar to "lagana" in his ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', but he uses a term with which he was already familiar. [[Durum wheat]], and thus pasta as it is known today, was introduced by [[Arabs]] from [[Libya]], during their conquest of [[Sicily]] in the late 7th century, according to the newsletter of the [[National Pasta Association|National Macaroni Manufacturers Association]],<ref name="Serventi 2002 10">{{Cite book | last = Serventi | first = Silvano | coauthors = Françoise Sabban | others = Trans.

*Contrary to the popular image of the [[Pilgrim Fathers]], the early settlers of the [[Plymouth Colony]] did not necessarily wear all black, and their [[capotain]]s (hats) were shorter and rounder than the widely depicted tall hat with a buckle on it. Instead, their fashion was based on that of the late [[Elizabethan era]]: [[doublet (clothing)|doublets]], [[jerkin (garment)|jerkins]] and [[ruff (clothing)|ruffs]]. Both men and women wore the same style of shoes, stockings, capes, coats and hats in a range of colors including reds, yellows, purples, and greens. Children of both sexes wore identical clothing: a [[chemise]], an ankle-length gown, an apron and a close fitting cap tied under the chin. At the age of seven, boys were "breeched", i.e. allowed to wear adult men's clothing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.ccsd.k12.wy.us/techcurr/social%20studies/05/0101pilcloth.html |title=Plymouth Colony Clothing |publisher=Web.ccsd.k12.wy.us |accessdate=February 9, 2012 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/nOvN |archivedate=2012-07-19 |deadurl=no}}</ref> According to [[Plimoth Plantation]] historian James W.

*[[Marie Antoinette]] did not say "[[let them eat cake]]" when she heard that the French peasantry were starving due to a shortage of bread. The phrase was first published in Rousseau's ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' when Marie was only 10 years old and most scholars believe that [[Rousseau]] coined it himself, or that it was said by [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria-Theresa]], the wife of [[Louis XIV]]. Even Rousseau (or Maria-Theresa) did not use the exact words but actually ''Qu'ils mangent de la brioche'' ("Let them eat [[brioche]] [a rich type of bread]"). Marie Antoinette was an unpopular ruler; therefore, people attribute the phrase "let them eat cake" to her, in keeping with her reputation as being hard-hearted and disconnected from her subjects.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keener|first=Candace|url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/european-history/top-5-marie-antoinette-scandals1.htm|title=HowStuffWorks "Let Them Eat Cake"|publisher=History.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=June 23, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/iG1A |archivedate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

* [[Antonio Salieri]] did not despise [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], nor did he have any role in [[Death of Mozart|Mozart's premature death]].

The supposed acrimony between the two, which has been adapted in numerous works of fiction (including the play ''[[Amadeus]]'' and its [[Amadeus (film)|film adaptation]]), is believed to have originated in a rivalry between German and Italian factions of the classical era musical scene.<ref>{{cite news | title=For Mozart's Arch rival, an Italian Renaissance | author=Horowitz, Jason | date=December 28, 2004 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/28/arts/music/28sali.html?ei=5088&en=7d60688cd81285e2&ex=1261976400&adxnnl=1&partner=rssnyt&adxnnlx=1127322281-E5bLYNdgoI5tijOhmwxecA | work=The New York Times |archiveurl=http://archive.is/P3oE |archivedate=2012-06-29 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

* [[Ronald Reagan]] was never seriously considered for the role of Rick Blaine in the 1942 film classic ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', eventually played by [[Humphrey Bogart]].

* [[Eva Perón]] never uttered the quote "''I will return and I will be millions''". The quote was first formulated by the indigenous leader [[Túpac Katari]] in 1781 shortly before being executed.

*[[Microwave oven]]s do not cook food from the inside out.

*Placing metal inside a [[microwave oven]] does not damage the oven's electronics. There are, however, other safety-related issues: [[Electric arc|electrical arcing]] may occur on pieces of metal not designed for use in a microwave oven, and metal objects may become hot enough to damage food, skin, or the interior of the microwave oven.

*Seasons are not caused by the [[Earth]] being closer to the [[Sun]] in the summer than in the winter. In fact, the Earth is farthest from the Sun when it is summer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Seasons are caused by Earth's 23.4-degree [[axial tilt]]. As the [[Earth's orbit|Earth orbits the Sun]], different parts of the world receive different amounts of direct sunlight. When an area of the Earth's surface is oriented perpendicular to the incoming sunlight, it receives more radiation than when it is oriented at an oblique angle. In July, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun resulting in longer days and more direct sunlight; in January, it is tilted away. The seasons are reversed in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], which is tilted towards the Sun in January and away from the Sun in July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/education/resources/sunearth/section06i.shtml|publisher=Adler Planetarium |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071216004548/http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/education/resources/sunearth/section06i.shtml|archivedate=December 16, 2007|title=Sun-Earth Connection|accessdate=May 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/outreach/sunearthmiscons.html|title=Ten Things You Thought You Knew about Sun-Earth Science|publisher=NASA|accessdate=May 8, 2009 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/qkzQ |archivedate=2012-05-27 |deadurl=no}}</ref> {{further|Effect of sun angle on climate}}
*[[Meteorite]]s are not necessarily hot when they reach the Earth. In fact, many meteorites are found with frost on them. As they enter the atmosphere, having been warmed only by the sun, meteors have a temperature below freezing. The intense heat produced during passage through the upper atmosphere at very high speed then melts a meteor's outside layer, but molten material is blown off and the interior does not have time to warm appreciably. Most meteorites fall through the relatively cool lower atmosphere for as long as several minutes at subsonic velocity before reaching the ground, giving plenty of time for their exterior to cool off again.<ref>{{cite web|author=Contributor: JT |url=http://listverse.com/2007/12/01/top-10-common-misconceptions/ |title=Top 10 Common Misconceptions |publisher=Listverse.com |accessdate=February 9, 2012 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/L3cj |archivedate=2012-07-10 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

*In [[South Korea]], it is commonly and incorrectly believed that sleeping in a closed room with an [[electric fan]] running can be fatal. According to the Korean government, "In some cases, a fan turned on too long can cause death from [[asphyxia|suffocation]], [[hypothermia]], or fire from overheating." The Korea Consumer Protection Board issued a consumer safety alert recommending that electric fans be set on timers, direction changed and doors left open. Belief in [[fan death]] is common even among knowledgeable medical professionals in Korea. According to Yeon Dong-su, dean of Kwandong University's medical school, "If it is completely sealed, then in the current of an electric fan, the temperature can drop low enough to cause a person to die of hypothermia."<ref name=Hypothermia/> Whereas an [[air conditioner]] transfers heat from the air and cools it, a fan moves air to increase the [[Evaporative cooling|evaporation of sweat]]. Due to [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy losses]] and [[Viscosity|viscous dissipation]], a fan will slowly heat a room.

*Human blood in [[veins]] is not blue. In fact, blood is always red due to [[hemoglobin]]. Deoxygenated blood has a deep red color, and oxygenated blood has a light cherry-red color. The misconception probably arises for two reasons: 1) From the way diagrams use colors to show the difference between veins (usually shown in blue) and [[arteries]] (usually shown in red). 2) Veins below the skin appear blue. This is due to a variety of reasons only weakly dependent on the color of the blood, including [[light scattering]] through the skin, and human color perception.<ref>{{cite journal

*Shaving does not cause [[terminal hair]] to grow back thicker or coarser or darker. This belief is due to hair which has never been cut having a tapered end, whereas after cutting there is no taper; the cut hair appears to be thicker, and feels coarser due to the sharper, unworn edges. The shorter hairs being "harder" (less flexible) than longer hairs also contributes to this effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snopes.com/oldwives/hairgrow.asp|title=Shaved Hair Grows Darker|publisher=snopes.com|accessdate=August 29, 2009 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/ogkc |archivedate=2012-05-27 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hair-removal/an00638 |title=Does shaving make hair grow back thicker? – |publisher=Mayoclinic.com |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2012 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/r5wI2 |archivedate=2013-01-28 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-beauty/shaving-tips-girls?page=2 |title=Shaving Tips for Teen Girls |publisher=Webmd.com |accessdate=February 9, 2012 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/TZEsa |archivedate=2013-02-09 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/hairstyles-beauty/how-to/facial-hair-post-shave |title=Cosmo Beauty Q&A: Facial Hair Post-Shave – Cosmopolitan |publisher=Cosmopolitan.com |accessdate=February 9, 2012 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/S7Vlh |archivedate=2013-01-20 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

*The [[red hair#Extinction hoax|redhead gene is not becoming extinct]]. In August 2007, many news organizations reported that redheads would become extinct, possibly as early as 2060, due to [[MC1R|the gene for red hair]] being [[recessive gene|recessive]].

Hold a piece of piece of paper so that it curves over your finger, then blow across the top. The paper will rise. However most people do not realize that the paper would NOT rise if it was flat, even though you are blowing air across the top of it at a furious rate. Bernoulli's principle does not apply directly in this case. This is because the air on the two sides of the paper did not start out from the same source. The air on the bottom is ambient air from the room, but the air on the top came from your mouth where you actually increased its speed without decreasing its pressure by forcing it out of your mouth. As a result the air on both sides of the flat paper actually has the same pressure, even though the air on the top is moving faster. The reason that a curved piece of paper does rise is that the air from your mouth speeds up even more as it follows the curve of the paper, which in turn lowers the pressure according to Bernoulli."

*The idea that [[lightning]] never strikes the same place twice is one of the oldest and most well-known [[superstition]]s about lightning. There is no reason that lightning would not be able to strike the same place twice; if there is a thunderstorm in a given area, then objects and places which are more prominent or conductive (and therefore minimize distance) are more likely to be struck. For instance, lightning strikes the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City about 100 times per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2005/ps_3.html|title=spinoff 2005-Lightning Often Strikes Twice|publisher=Office of the Chief Technologist, NASA|work = Spinoff |date=March 25, 2010|accessdate=June 23, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/xwRS |archivedate=2012-05-27 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Staff |url=http://weather.weatherbug.com/weather-news/weather-reports.html?story=6571 |title=Full weather report story from WeatherBug.com |publisher=Weather.weatherbug.com|date=May 17, 2010|accessdate=June 23, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/mb4y |archivedate=2012-05-27 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

As MythBusters noted, the Empire State Building is a particularly poor setting for this misconception, since its tapered shape would make it impossible to drop anything directly from the top to street level.

Instead, this practice can result in energy savings of five to fifteen percent. This is due to the fact that the [[Heat transfer|heat lost]] by a warm structure in a cold environment is proportional to the heat difference between the inside and outside of the structure.
