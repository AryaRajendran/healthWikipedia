[[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]] plays an important role in the genesis of [[obesity]].  Personal choices, advertising, social customs and cultural influences, as well as food availability and pricing all play a role in determining what and how much an individual eats.

==Dietary energy supply==
[[File:World Per Person Energy Consumption.png|thumb|Average per capita energy consumption of the world from 1961 to 2002]]
The [[dietary energy supply]] is the food available for human consumption, usually expressed in kilocalories per person per day.  It gives an overestimate of the total amount of food consumed as it reflects both food consumed and food wasted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/statistics/compendium_2006/concepts.asp |title=Compendium of food and agriculture indicators - 2006 |format= |work=FAO |accessdate=February 18, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  The per capita [[dietary energy supply]] varies markedly between different regions and countries. It has also changed significantly over time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/statistics/compendium_2006/list.asp |title=Compendium of food and agriculture indicators - 2006 |format= |work=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |accessdate=January 10, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080802131149/http://www.fao.org/statistics/compendium_2006/list.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = August 2, 2008}}</ref> From the early 1970s to the late 1990s, the average calories available per person per day (the amount of food bought) has increased in all part of the world except Eastern Europe and parts of Africa. The United States had the highest availability with 3654 calories per person in 1996.<ref name=FAO1990s/> This increased further in 2002 to 3770.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ES/ess/yearbook/vol_1_2/pdf/United-States-of-America.pdf |title=www.fao.org |format= |work=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |accessdate=January 10, 2009}}</ref>  During the late 1990s, Europeans had 3394 calories per person, in the developing areas of Asia there were 2648 calories per person, and in sub-Sahara Africa people had 2176 calories per person.<ref name=FAO1990s>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/statistics/chartroom/chart.asp?image=img/charts/fbs/chart08.gif |title=Calories per capita per day |format=gif |work=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |accessdate=January 10, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/1470965/USDA-frsept99b |title=USDA: frsept99b |format= |work=USDA |accessdate=January 10, 2009}}</ref>

From 1971 – 2000, the average daily number of calories which women consumed in the United States increased by 335 calories per day (1542 calories in 1971 and 1877 calories in 2000). For men, the average increase was 168 calories per day (2450 calories in 1971 and 2618 calories in 2000). Most of these extra calories came from an increase in carbohydrate consumption rather than an increase in fat consumption.<ref name=CDC2004>{{cite journal | author=Wright JD, Kennedy-Stephenson J, Wang CY, McDowell MA, Johnson CL | title=Trends in intake of energy and macronutrients—United States, 1971–2000 | journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep | year=2004 | month=February | volume=53 | issue=4 | pages=80–2 | url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5304a3.htm | pmid=14762332}}</ref>  The primary sources of these extra carbohydrates were [[sweetened beverages]], which now accounts for almost 25 percent of daily calories in young adults in America.<ref name=Caballero>{{cite journal |author=Caballero B |title=The global epidemic of obesity: An overview |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=29 |issue= |pages=1–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17569676 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxm012 |url=}}</ref>  As these estimates are based on a person's recall, they may underestimate the amount of calories actually consumed.<ref name=CDC2004/>

==Fast food==
As societies become increasingly reliant on [[food energy|energy-dense]] fast-food meals, the association between [[fast food]] consumption and [[obesity]] becomes more concerning.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosenheck R |title=Fast food consumption and increased caloric intake: a systematic review of a trajectory towards weight gain and obesity risk |journal=Obes Rev |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=535–47 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18346099 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00477.x |url=}}</ref>  In the United States consumption of fast food meal has tripled and calorie intake from fast food has quadrupled between 1977 and 1995.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lin BH, Guthrie J and Frazao E |editor=Frazão E |title=Agriculture Information Bulletin No. 750: America's Eating Habits: Changes and Consequences | url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/aib750/ |year=1999 |publisher=US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service |location=Washington, DC |pages=213–239 |chapter=Nutrient contribution of food away from home}}</ref>  Consumption of sweetened drinks is also believed to be a major contributor to the rising rates of obesity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malik VS, Schulze MB, Hu FB |title=Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain: a systematic review |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=274–88 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16895873 |doi= |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16895873 |pmc=3210834}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Olsen NJ, Heitmann BL |title=Intake of calorically sweetened beverages and obesity |journal=Obes Rev |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=68–75 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=18764885 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00523.x |url=}}</ref>

==Portion size==
[[File:Portion1.jpg|thumb|A comparison of a typical cheeseburger 20 years ago (left) which had 333 calories with a modern cheeseburger (right) which contains 590 calories as per the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]]]]
The portion size of many prepackage and restaurant foods has increased in both the United States and Denmark since the 1970s.<ref name=CDC2004/>
Fast food servings, for example, are 2 to 5 times larger than they were in the 1980s. Evidence has shown that larger portions of energy-dense foods lead to greater energy intake and thus to greater rates of obesity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ledikwe JH, Ello-Martin JA, Rolls BJ |title=Portion sizes and the obesity epidemic |journal=J.

==Sugar consumption==
Existing evidence from large-scale cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies supports that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is correlated with the childhood and adult obesity epidemic in the United States population (Malik et al. 2006). Sweetened drinks containing either [[sucrose]] alone or sucrose in combination with [[fructose]] appear to lead to weight gain due to increase energy intake.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tappy|first=L|coauthors=Lê, KA|title=Metabolic effects of fructose and the worldwide increase in obesity|journal=Physiological reviews|date=2010 Jan|volume=90|issue=1|pages=23–46|pmid=20086073|doi=10.1152/physrev.00019.2009}}</ref> In fact, about half of total added sugar consumed in the United States is in liquid form.<ref name="Woodward-Lopez">Woodward-Lopez G, Kao J, Ritchie L. (2010) To what extent have sweetened beverages contributed to the obesity epidemic? Public Health Nutrition.14(3), 499-509.</ref> Teenage boys showed the greatest consumption of sugar sweetened beverages, upwards of 357 calories per day.<ref name="Woodward-Lopez" /> In addition to the evidence that humans have a natural propensity towards sugar,<ref name="Avena">Avena, N.M., Rada, P., Hoebel, B.G. Evidence for sugar addiction: Behavioral and neurochemical effects of intermittent, excessive sugar intake. Neuroscience Biobehavioral Review. (2008) 32(1): 20-39.</ref> there exists additional biological plausibility that explains the correlation of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and obesity.<ref name="Malik2006">Malik, V.S., Schulze, M.B., & Hu, F.B. Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain: systematic review. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. (2006) 84: 274-288.</ref>

Sugar-sweetened beverages raise concern because they are calorie-dense and yet produce low satiety.<ref name="Hu2010">Hu, F., Malik, V. Sugar-sweetened beverages and risk of obesity and type II diabetes: epidemiologic evidence. Physiology and Behavior. (2010) 100: 47-54.</ref> There exists a strong correlation between the consumption of liquid calories and total energy intake. Individuals do not tend to decrease solid calories in compensation for increased liquid calories.<ref name="Malik2006" /> For example, if there were no compensation for liquid calories, the 40-50g of sugar in each 12 oz. can of soda drunk on a daily basis could lead to a 15 pound weight gain.<ref name="Malik2006" />  On the national scale, the American Heart Association estimates that approximately half of the total caloric intake increase over the past 30 years is attributable to liquid calories.<ref name="Johnson">Johnson, R.K., Appel, L.J., Brands, M., Howard, B.V., Lefevre, M., Lustig, R.H., Sacks, F., Steffen, L.M., Wylie-Rosett, J. Dietary sugars intake and cardiovascular health: a scientific statement from the American heart association. Circulation. (2009) 120: 1011-1020.</ref> The high glycemic load of these beverages is also thought to be a contributor to chronic disease, including [[diabetes]] <ref name="Hu2010" /> and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.<ref name="Assy">Assy, N. Nasser, G. Kamayse, I., Nseir, W., Beniashvili, Z., Djibre, A., Grosovski, M. Soft drink consumption linked with fatty liver in the absence of traditional risk factors. Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology. (2008). 22(10): 811-816.</ref> Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that suggests sugar may be an addictive substance, further potentiating any individuals’ existing problem of excessive consumption.<ref name="Avena" />

Based on socioecological models of health, it is easy to understand how sugar-sweetened beverages have sustained numerous historical changes that have made them widely appealing and available. For example, the soda industry budget for advertising in 2000 totaled over $700 million, an increase of over $381 million since 1986.<ref name="Woodward-Lopez " />  Furthermore, standard serving sizes have increased from 8-ounce to 12-ounce bottles between 1977-1996.<ref name="Woodward-Lopez " /> Price incentives from beverage companies have maintained their products very cheap <ref name="Brownell">Brownell, K.D., Farley, T., Willett, W.C., Popkin, B.M., Chaloupka, F.J., Thompson, J.W., Ludwig, D.S. The public health and economic benefits of taxing sugar-sweetened beverages. The New England Journal of Medicine. (2009) 361(16):1599-1605.</ref> This obesogenic environment has promoted the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages on a national level correlating with trends in the obesity epidemic.

==Social policy and change==
Agricultural policy and techniques in the United States and Europe have led to lower food prices. In the United States, subsidization of [[Maize|corn]], [[soy]], [[wheat]], and [[rice]] through the [[U.S. farm bill]] has made the main sources of processed food cheap compared to fruits and vegetables.<ref>{{cite news|author=Pollan, Michael|title=You Are What You Grow|work=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/magazine/22wwlnlede.t.html?ex=1186027200&en=bbe0f6a2c10e3b3c&ei=5070|date= 22 April 2007|accessdate= 2007-07-30}}</ref>

Participation by adults in the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (i.e. [[Food Stamps]]) is positively associated with obesity, waist circumference, elevated fasting glucose, and [[metabolic syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=CW Leung, WC Willett, and EL Ding|title=Low-income Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation is related to adiposity and metabolic risk factors|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|volume=95|issue=1|pages=17–24|year=2012|month=Jan|pmid=22170370|doi=10.3945/ajcn.111.012294|url=}}</ref>

==Metabolism==
Evidence does not support the commonly expressed view that some obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow [[metabolism]].  On average obese people have a greater energy expenditure than normal weight or thin people.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kushner, Robert |title=Treatment of the Obese Patient (Contemporary Endocrinology) |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2007 |pages=158 |isbn=1-59745-400-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=vWjK5etS7PMC&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=measurement+of+metabolism+in+obese+Bessesen |doi= |accessdate=April 5, 2009}}</ref> This is because it takes more energy to maintain an increased body mass.<ref name=Anes2000>{{cite journal |author=Adams JP, Murphy PG |title=Obesity in anaesthesia and intensive care |journal=Br J Anaesth |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=91–108 |year=2000 |month=July |pmid=10927998 |doi= 10.1093/bja/85.1.91|url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10927998}}</ref>  Obese people also underreport how much food they consume compared to those of normal weight.<ref name=Kopelman2005>{{cite book|author=Peter G.
