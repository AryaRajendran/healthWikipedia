==Formation and history==

The Devon Air Ambulance Trust was formed by Ann Thomas, in memory of her son, 18-year-old Ceri Thomas, who was fatally injured in a [[road traffic collision]] in 1986.<ref name=BBC3/><ref name=daathistory>{{cite web|publisher=Devon Air Ambulance Trust|title=Devon Air Ambulance - The Trust|url=http://www.daat.org/site/1/The_Trust.html|accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref>  At hospital, his mother learned that the quicker a patient receives hospital treatment, the greater that patient's chances of survival. Subsequently, she started a campaign to launch an air ambulance service for [[Devon]].<ref name=daathistory/>

The service went into operation on 27 August 1992,<ref name=daathistory/> covering the entirety of the county of [[Devon]], including the rural and inaccessible moors of [[Exmoor]] and [[Dartmoor]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Air Ambulance Association UK|url=http://www.airambulanceassociation.co.uk/find_your_air_ambulance.php|title=Air Ambulance Coverage Map}}</ref> The trust currently operates two [[helicopter]]s<ref name=BBC2/> and can reach 50% of locations in Devon within 5 minutes of taking to the air, with remaining locations accessible within 20 minutes.<ref name=daatheli>{{cite web|publisher=Devon Air Ambulance Trust|title=The Helicopters|url=http://www.daat.org/site/1/Helicopters.html|accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref>

==Organisation==
The trust currently operates two aircraft, both [[Eurocopter EC135|Eurocopter EC135T2]] models, although of different model years, from two different airfields, in order to maximise coverage of the county.  Both helicopters fly for 10 hours a day, 7 days a week.<ref name=daatheli/>

The South Devon helicopter is located along with the [[Devon and Cornwall Constabulary]] helicopter at Police headquarters at Middlemoor, near [[Exeter]], having previously been based at [[Exeter International Airport]].  The aircraft is registered G-DVAA, and was purchased in 2008 for around £3.3m.<ref name=daatheli/>

The North Devon helicopter is located at Eaglescott Airfeld,<ref name=daatheli/> previously at Belle Vue Airfield,<ref>{{cite news|publisher=North Devon Gazette|title=Region will keep its air ambulance|url=http://www.northdevongazette.co.uk/northdevongazette/news/story.aspx?brand=NDGOnline&category=news&tBrand=devon24&tCategory=newsndga&itemid=DEED03+Aug+2005+08:46:00:223|date=3 August 2005|accessdate=2009-04-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> near [[Great Torrington]].

==Notable donations==
Both of the helicopters bear the signature of television presenter [[Jennie Bond]] who named the Trust as her chosen charity during her appearance in the show ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!]]''. The money raised enabled the Trust to buy a [[GPS]] moving map system for the helicopter.<ref name=daatheli/>
