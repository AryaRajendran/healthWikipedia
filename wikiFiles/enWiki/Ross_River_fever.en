'''Ross River Fever'''  is a [[mosquito]]-borne [[infectious disease]] caused by infection with the [[Ross River virus]]. The illness is typically characterised by an [[influenza-like illness]] and [[polyarthritis]]. The virus is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to [[Australia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[New Caledonia]] and several other islands in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].<ref name="ABC Fact file">{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/health/library/stories/2006/01/19/1831791.htm | title = Fact file: Ross River fever |author = Ed Poliness |work = ABC Health & Wellbeing | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | date= 2006-01-19 |accessdate = 2008-10-29}}</ref>

==History==
The first outbreak of RRF was in 1928 in the [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]] and [[Narrandera, New South Wales|Narrandera]] region in [[New South Wales, Australia]].<ref name="afp">[http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200908/200908barber.pdf Australian Family Physician: Ross River virus]</ref> The virus was first isolated in 1959 from a mosquito trapped along the [[Ross River (Queensland)|Ross River]] in [[Townsville, Queensland]]. Since then, outbreaks have occurred in all Australian states, including Tasmania, and metropolitan areas.<ref name="afp" /> The largest outbreak occurred in 1979-1980 in the [[Western Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]], and affected more than 60,000 people.<ref name="afp" />

Before the identification of this infectious agent, the disease was referred to as "epidemic polyarthritis". This term was also used for a similar Australian disease caused by another [[mosquito]]-borne virus, [[Barmah Forest Virus]].<ref name="RR&BF">{{cite web | url = http://medent.usyd.edu.au/fact/ross%20river%20&%20barmah%20forest.htm | title = Ross River & Barmah Forest  |author = Russell RC & Doggett SL | publisher = Department of Medical Entomology, [[University of Sydney]] |accessdate = 2008-10-29}}</ref>

==Incidence and epidemiology==
Most notifications are from Queensland, tropical Western Australia and the [[Northern Territory]]. Geographical risk factors include areas of higher rainfall and higher maximal tides.<ref name="afp" /> In the tropics, Ross River Fever is more prevalent during the summer/autumn "[[wet season]]", particularly January - March, when [[mosquito]] populations numbers are high. In southern parts of Australia, this time period may shift to earlier in the year during spring/summer. Areas noted of common place contraction of the virus include townships and along the River Murray areas. Backwaters and Lagoons are breeding grounds for mosquitos and local medical treating facilities report higher cases than cities away from the river around the riverina areas. <ref name= "ABC Fact file"/><ref name=RR&BF/> 

Areas near suitable mosquito breeding grounds — [[marsh]]es, [[wetland]]s, waterways and farms with irrigation systems — are high risk areas for outbreaks. As such, the disease is more characteristic of rural and regional areas.<ref name=RR&BF/> Infection is most common in adult aged 25–44 years old, with males and females equally affected.<ref name="afp" /> Ross River Fever is on the Australian [[Department of Health and Ageing]]'s list of [[notifiable disease]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda_surveil-nndss-dislist.htm | title = Australian national notifiable diseases list and case definitions | work = National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance | publisher = [[Department of Health and Ageing]] | location = Australia | date = 2004-03-12 | accessdate = 2008-11-29 }}</ref>

==Transmission==
The virus is not contagious and is spread only by [[mosquitoes]]. The main [[Natural reservoir|reservoir host]]s are [[kangaroos]] and [[Wallaby|wallabies]], although horses, [[possums]] and possibly birds and [[Pteropus|flying foxes]] play a role. Over 30 species have been implicated as possible [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], but the major species for Ross River Fever are ''[[Culex annulirostris]]'' in inland areas, ''[[Aedes vigilax]]'' in northern coastal regions and ''[[Aedes campotorhynchus|Ae. camptorhynchus]]'' in southern coastal regions.<ref name="afp" /><ref name = "RR&BF"/>

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of the disease may vary widely in severity, but major indicators are [[arthralgia]], [[arthritis]], [[fever]], and [[rash]].<ref name="RR&BF"/> The incubation period is 7–9 days. About a third of infections are asymptomatic, particularly in children.<ref name="afp" /><ref name="RR&BF"/>

===Acute illness===
About 95% of symptomatic cases report joint pain.<ref name="afp" /> This is typically symmetrical and with acute onset, affecting the fingers, toes, ankles, wrists, back, knees and elbows.<ref name="RR&BF"/> Fatigue occurs in 90% and fever, [[myalgia]] and headache occur in 50-60%.<ref name="afp" /> 

A rash occurs in 50% of patients and is widespread and [[maculopapular]]. Lymphadenopathy occurs commonly; sore throat and coryza less frequently. Diarrhea is rare. About 50% of people report needing time off work with the acute illness.<ref name="afp" /> If the rash is unnoticed, these symptoms are quite easily mistaken for more common illnesses like [[influenza]] or the [[common cold]].  Recovery from the flu symptoms is expected within a month, but, due to the fact that the virus currently cannot be removed once infection has occurred  secondary symptoms of joint and muscle inflammation, pain and stiffness can last for many years.

Less common manifestations include splenomegaly, hematuria and glomerulonephritis.  Headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia may occur. There have been three case reports suggesting meningitis or encephalitis.

===Chronic illness===
Reports from the 1980s and 1990s suggested RRV infection was associated with [[arthralgia]], fatigue and depression lasting for years.<ref name="RR&BF"/> More recent prospective studies have reported a steady improvement in symptoms over the first few months, with 15-66% of patients having ongoing arthralgia at 3 months. [[Arthralgias]] have resolved in the majority by 5–7 months. The incidence of chronic fatigue is 12% at 6 months and 9% at 12 months, similar to [[Epstein-Barr virus]] and [[Q fever]].<ref name="afp" /> The presence of a [[premorbid]] diagnosis of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] strongly influences the chance of significant illness at 12 months.<ref name="afp" />

==Diagnosis==
A [[blood test]] is the only way to confirm a case of Ross River Fever. Several types of blood tests may be used to examine antibody levels in the blood. Tests may either look for simply elevated antibodies (which indicate some sort of infection), or specific antibodies to the virus.<ref name=RR&BF/>

==Treatment and prevention==
Antiviral drugs, that target infections with RRV. Patients are usually managed with simple [[analgesics]], [[anti-inflammatories]], [[anti-pyretics]] and rest while the illness runs its course.<ref name= "ABC Fact file"/><ref name=RR&BF/> As there is currently no way of removing the virus from the body infection usually means lifelong recurrence of the symptoms at random intervals, affecting any part of the joint or muscular system, each occurrence lasting from a couple of days to many months.

===Prevention===
There is currently no vaccine available. The primary method of disease prevention is minimizing mosquito bites, as the disease is only transmitted by mosquitoes. Typical advice includes use of mosquito repellent and mosquito screens, wearing light coloured clothing, and minimising standing water around homes (e.g. removing [[Bromeliads]], plant pots, garden ponds).<ref name="afp" /> Staying indoors during dusk/dawn hours when mosquitos are most active may also be effective. Bush camping is a common precipitant of infection so particular care is required.

==Research==
The study of RRF has been recently facilitated by the development of a [[Animal testing on rodents|mouse model]]. Mice infected with RRV develop hind-limb arthritis/arthralgia which is similar to human disease. The disease in mice is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate including macrophages which are immunopathogenic and exacerbate disease.  Furthermore, mice deficient in the [[Complement component 3|C3 protein]] do not suffer from severe disease following infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Morrison TE, Fraser RJ, Smith PN, Mahalingam S, Heise MT |title=Complement contributes to inflammatory tissue destruction in a mouse model of Ross River virus-induced disease |journal=J. Virol. |volume=81 |issue=10 |pages=5132–43 |year=2007 |pmid=17314163 |pmc=1900244 |doi=10.1128/JVI.02799-06 |url=http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17314163}}</ref>  This indicates that an aberrant innate immune response is responsible for severe disease following RRV infection.
