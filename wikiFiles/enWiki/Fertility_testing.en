'''Fertility testing''' is the process by which fertility is assessed, both generally and also to find the [[fertile window]].  General health affects fertility, and [[STI testing]] is an important related field.

==Women==
Healthy women are fertile from [[puberty]] until the [[menopause]], although fertility is typically much reduced towards the extremes of this period.  The onset of puberty is typically identified by [[menarche]] and the presence of [[secondary sexual characteristics]] such as [[breast]] development, the appearance of [[pubic hair]] and changes to body fat distribution.  The end of a woman's fertile years typically comes somewhat before the menopause, as fertility declines to a point where establishing a viable [[pregnancy]] is very unlikely.

===Ovulation testing===
Various methods of predicting fertility exist, to either aid or avoid [[pregnancy]]

====Stretch test====
[[Image:cervical mucus1.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Cervical mucus]]
[[Cervical mucus]] becomes clear and stretchy during the [[fertile window]], to allow sperm to survive in and travel through it.  The consistency of fertile mucous is akin to [[egg white]].

====Ovulation Prediction Kit====
[[Ovulation prediction kit]]s are usually [[antibody]] tests for [[luteinising hormone]], which peaks in urine around the time of ovulation.  More sophisticated tests, such as the [[Clearblue]] fertility monitor, also test for [[estradiol]].

====Cervical position====
The [[cervix]] becomes soft, high, open and wet during the fertile window.

====Basal body temperature====
[[Basal body temperature]] changes during the [[menstural cycle]].  This enables identification of the fertile window, and is used in commercial thermometers to identify the fall then rise associated with [[ovulation]].

====Calendar methods====
Because the fertile window arrives at approximately the same time each month, [[natural family planning|calendar methods]] can be used to predict ovulation.

===Diagnosis of infertility===

Women of fertile age may be infertile for a number of reasons.  Various tests are available to establish reasons.

====Anti-Mullerian hormone testing====
[[Anti-Mullerian hormone]] tests allow the estimation of [[ovarian reserve]].  These give an indication of the likely remaining fertility opportunities a woman may have.

====Follicle stimulating hormone====
Tests for [[follicle stimulating hormone]] establish whether or not a woman will ovulate in any given month.  This test is typically carried out on day 3 of the [[menstural cycle]]

====Hysterosalpingography====
[[Hysterosalpingography]] involve the inspection of the [[fallopian tubes]] and [[uterus]], by the injection of a [[radiocontrast]] agent, to ensure the egg can pass down the tube without obstruction, and to identify uterine abnormalities.

====Ovarian ultrasound====
[[Ultrasound scan]]s of the [[ovaries]] may be conducted to establish the development of [[ovarian follicles]].  This can be useful particularly in the diagnosis of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]].

====Hysteroscopy====
[[Hysteroscopy]] is used to diagnose the presence of a number of conditions which may affect fertility, such as [[uterine fibroids]], [[Asherman's syndrome]], and [[bicornate uterus]]. It involves the insertion of an [[endoscope]] to produce images of the inside of the [[uterus]].

====Laparoscopy====
[[Laparoscopy]] is used to examine the interior of the [[abdomen]].  It can be used to establish patency of the [[fallopian tubes]], and is especially suitable for the diagnosis of [[endometriosis]].

==Men==
{{main|semen analysis|male infertility}}
Males who have gone through [[puberty]] should be fertile throughout life.  Men [[ejaculate]] a fluid called [[semen]] from the [[penis]].  This contains [[sex cells]] called [[sperm]], which travel to the [[ovum|egg]] through the female [[reproductive tract]], typically causing [[fertilisation]] to occur in the [[fallopian tubes]].

Fertility testing for men involves [[semen testing]] and [[genetic testing]], as other factors such as [[impotence]] are obvious.  Sperm can be tested for [[sperm count]], [[sperm motility]], [[pH]], [[Semen analysis#Morphology|sperm morphology]], volume, [[fructose]] content, and [[acrosome]] activity.  Checks are also made to identify [[undescended testicles]] and [[retrograde ejaculation]], along with [[medical history]], such as cancer treatment, [[radioactivity|radiation]], drug use, etc. In some cases the [[hamster zona-free ovum test]] may also be used to diagnose fertility.

[[Genetic testing]] and [[chromosomal analysis]] can rule out some other causes of male infertility, such as [[Kleinfelter's syndrome]].
