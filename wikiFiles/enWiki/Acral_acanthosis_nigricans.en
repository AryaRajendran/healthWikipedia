The former emphasizes that it is a type of acanthosis nigricans, the latter its uniqueness. It was discovered by internationally renowned [[dermatologist]] [[Robert A. Schwartz]]. Its original description in 1981 observed it as a disorder seen relatively commonly as velvety hyperpigmented plaques in dark complexioned individuals. It is often particularly prominent over the elbows, knees, knuckles and dorsal surfaces of the feet in otherwise healthy individuals with axillae and other intertriginous regions appearing normal.<ref name="Tilgen W 2009">{{cite book |author=Tilgen W |chapter=Benign epidermal tumors |editor=WHC Burgdorf, G Plewig, HH Wolff, M Landthaler, O Braun-Falco |title=Braun-Falco's Dermatology |publisher=Springer |location=Heidelberg |year=2009 |isbn=3-540-29312-4 |pages=1340–7 |edition=3rd }}</ref>
