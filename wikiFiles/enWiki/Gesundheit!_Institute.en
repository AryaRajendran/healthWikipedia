The '''Gesundheit! Institute''' (German for 'Good health!') is a project founded by Dr. [[Patch Adams|Hunter "Patch" Adams]] in 1971, located outside of [[Hillsboro, West Virginia|Hillsboro]] in [[Pocahontas County, West Virginia|Pocahontas County]], [[West Virginia]]. The Institute states its vision as being dedicated to revolutionizing [[health care]] delivery by replacing what the Institute sees as greed and [[competition]] with [[generosity]] and [[compassion]]. Creation of Gesundheit! Institute was a topic of the 1998 movie [[Patch Adams (film)|''Patch Adams'']] starring [[Robin Williams]].<ref>{{imdb title|0129290|Patch Adams}}</ref>

==Description==
The goal of the Institute is to integrate a traditional hospital with alternative medicine such as [[naturopathy]], [[acupuncture]], and [[homeopathy]]. Care combines integrative medicine with performing arts, crafts, nature, agriculture, and recreation. One of the continued missions of the Gesundheit! Institute involves the concept of "[[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] clowning". The project uses the theme of laughter as an integral element of effective doctoral care. In the past, the Gesundheit! Institute has taken clowns into the war zones in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], refugee camps in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], as well as [[South Africa]]n orphanages.

==Current plans==
In October 2007, Patch Adams and the Gesundheit Board unveiled their campaign to raise $1 million towards building a Teaching Center and Clinic on the Institute's land in West Virginia.  The plan includes a 40-bed hospital that utilizes [[holistic health|holistic healthcare]], enabling Gesundheit to see patients in its own facility, while perfecting and sharing better healthcare design theories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/playing_doctor|title=Playing Doctor: An Interview with Patch Adams|accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patchadams.org|title=Official Website of the Gesundheit!
