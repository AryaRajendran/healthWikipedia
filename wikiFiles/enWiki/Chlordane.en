'''Chlordane''', or '''chlordan''', is an [[organochlorine compound]] used as a [[pesticide]].  This white solid was sold in the U.S. until 1983 as an insecticide for crops like [[Maize|corn]] and [[citrus]], and on lawns and domestic gardens.<ref name=Ullmann>Robert L. Metcalf “Insect Control” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry” Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a14_263}}</ref>

==Production and uses==
Chlordane is one so-called cyclodiene pesticide, meaning that it is derived from [[hexachlorocyclopentadiene]]. Hexachlorocyclopentadiene forms an [[adduct]] with [[cyclopentadiene]], and chlorination of this adduct gives two isomers, α and β. The beta-isomer is popularly known as gamma.  The mixture is called chlordane.  The β isomer is more bioactive.<ref name=Ullmann/>  It was sold in the [[United States]] from 1948 to 1988, both as a dust and an emulsified solution.

Because of concern about damage to the environment and harm to human health, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) banned all uses of chlordane in 1983, except termite control. The EPA banned all uses of chlordane in 1988.<ref>[http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/factsheet/Pesticide/fs11.chlordane.cfm Pesticides and Breast Cancer Risk: Chlordane], Fact Sheet #11, March 1998, Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors
Cornell University</ref>  The EPA recommends that children should not drink water with more than 60 parts of chlordane per billion parts of drinking water (60 ppb) for longer than 1 day. EPA has set a limit in drinking water of 2 ppb.

Chlordane is very persistent in the environment because it does not break down easily, and it could also polymerize into a larger molecule.

==Origin, pathways of exposure, and processes of excretion==
In the years 1948-1988, chlordane was a common pesticide for corn and citrus crops as a, as well as a method of termite control.<ref name="ATSDR 2010">Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry (ATSDR).  Toxic Substances Portal: Chlordane.  Last updated September, 2010 [online].  Available at URL:  http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/substances/toxsubstance.asp?toxid=62</ref>  Pathways of exposure to chlordane include ingestion of crops grown in chlordane-contaminated soil, ingestion of high-fat foods such as meat, fish, and dairy, as Chlordane builds up in fatty tissue, as well as through inhalation of air near chlordane-treated homes and landfills.<ref name="ATSDR 1995">Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry (ATSDR).  ToxFaqs: September, 1995.  Available at URL: http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts31.pdf</ref>  Chlordane is excreted slowly through feces and urine elimination, as well as through breast milk in nursing mothers, and is able to cross the placenta and become absorbed by developing fetuses in pregnant women.<ref name="CDC 2010">Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals: Chemical Information: Chlordane.  Last updated November, 2010 [online].</ref>

==Environmental impact==
Being hydrophobic, chlordane adheres to soil particles and enters groundwater only slowly, owing to its low solubility (0.009 ppm). It degrades only over the course of years.<ref>http://organic.com.au/pesticides/Chlorodane/</ref>  Chlordane bioaccumulates in animals.  It is highly toxic to fish, with an {{LD50}} of 0.022–0.095&nbsp;mg/kg (oral).

==Health effects==
Exposure to chlordane metabolites may be associated with [[testicular cancer]]. The incidence of [[seminoma]] in men with the highest blood levels of ''cis''-nonachlor  was almost double that of men with the lowest levels.<ref>{{Citation  | last = McGlynn  | first = Katherine A.  | last2 =  Quraishi | first2 =  Sabah M.  | last3 =  ''et al.''  | title =  Persistent Organochlorine Pesticides and Risk of Testicular Germ Cell Tumors  | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute  | volume = 100  | date = April 29, 2008   | url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/djn101v1  | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djn101  | pages = 663  | pmid = 18445826  | first3 = BI  | last4 = Weber  | first4 = JP  | last5 = Rubertone  | first5 = MV  | last6 = Erickson  | first6 = RL  | issue = 9 }}.</ref> [[Prostate cancer]] has been associated with ''trans''-nonachlor levels, a component of chlordane.<ref>http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/0900919/0900919.pdf {{doi|10.1289/ehp.0900919}}</ref>  Japanese workers who used chlordane over a long period of time had minor changes in liver function.<ref>http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts31.html</ref>

[[Heptachlor]] and chlordane are some of the most potent carcinogens tested in animal models.  No human epidemiological study has been conducted to determine the relationship between levels of chlordane/heptachlor in indoor air and rates of cancer in inhabitants. However, studies have linked chlordane/heptachlor in human tissues with cancers of the breast, prostate, brain, and cancer of blood cells—[[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]]. Breathing chlordane in indoor air is the main route of exposure for these levels in human tissues.  Currently, USEPA has defined a concentration of 24 nanogram per cubic meter of air (ng/M<sup>3</sup>) for chlordane compounds over a 20-year exposure period as the concentration that will increase the probability of cancer by 1 in 1,000,000 persons.  This probability of developing cancer increases to 10 in 1,000,000 persons with an exposure of 100&nbsp;ng/M<sup>3</sup> and 100 in 1,000,000 with an exposure of 1000&nbsp;ng/M<sup>3</sup>.<ref>http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0142.htm</ref>

The non-cancer health effects of chlordane compounds (migraines, respiratory infections, diabetes, immune-system activation, anxiety, depression, blurry vision, confusion, intractable seizures as well as permanent neurological damage)<ref>http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=349&tid=62</ref> may affect more people than cancer.  The [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR) has defined a concentration of chlordane compounds of 20&nbsp;ng/M<sup>3</sup> as the Minimal Risk Level (MRLs). ATSDR defines Minimal Risk Level as an estimate of daily human exposure to a dose of a chemical that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of adverse non-cancerous effects over a specific duration of exposure.<ref>http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp31.html</ref>

==Remediation==
Chemical remediation of chlordane in soils was attempted by the US Army Corps of Engineers by mixing chlordane with aqueous lime and persulfate.  In a [[phytoremediation]] study, [[Kentucky bluegrass]] and [[Perennial ryegrass]] were found to be minimally affected by chlordane, and both were found to take it up into their roots and shoots.<ref name="US Army Corps of Engineers">{{cite web|last=Medina|first=Victor F.|title=Legacy Chlordane in Soils from Housing Areas Treated with Organochlorine Pesticides|url=http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/elpubs/pdf/trel09-20.pdf|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers|accessdate=10 October 2012|coauthors=Scott A.
