In [[medicine]] ([[gastroenterology]]), the '''Child-Pugh score''' (sometimes the '''Child-Turcotte-Pugh score''') is used to assess the prognosis of chronic liver disease, mainly [[cirrhosis]]. Although it was originally used to predict mortality during surgery, it is now used to determine the prognosis, as well as the required strength of treatment and the necessity of [[liver transplantation]]. 

==Scoring==
The score employs five clinical measures of liver disease. Each measure is scored 1-3, with 3 indicating most severe derangement.

| [[Ascites]]

| [[Hepatic encephalopathy]]
| None
| Grade I-II (or suppressed with medication)
| Grade III-IV (or refractory)
|}

Different textbooks and publications use different measures. Some older reference works substitute PT prolongation for INR.

In [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] (PSC) and [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] (PBC), the bilirubin references are changed to reflect the fact that these diseases feature high conjugated bilirubin levels. The upper limit for 1 point is 68 μmol/l (4&nbsp;mg/dl) and the upper limit for 2 points is 170 μmol/l (10&nbsp;mg/dl).

==Interpretation==
Chronic liver disease is classified into Child-Pugh class A to C, employing the added score from above.

==Other scoring systems==
Although the Child-Turcotte scoring system was the first of its kind in stratifying the seriousness of end-stage liver disease, it is by no means the only one. The [[Model for End-Stage Liver Disease]] (MELD) is used increasingly to assess patients for liver transplantation, although both scores seem to be more or less equivalent.
The MELD score is perhaps a more accurate assessment of perioperative  mortality  in  patients  with  hepatic  dysfunction.  The score  is  derived  from  a  linear  regression model  based  on  serum bilirubin,  creatinine  levels,  and  the  international  normalized ratio (INR). It is more accurate than the Child classification in that it  is objective,  gives weights  to  each variable,  and does not  rely on arbitrary cut-off values.<ref>(Teh et al., 2007)</ref>
Clinicians can use a  website<ref>http://mayoclinic.org/meld/mayomodel9.html</ref> to calculate the 7-day, 30-day, 90-day, 1-year, and 5-year surgical mortality risk on the basis of the patient’s age,  ASA  class,  INR,  serum  bilirubin,  and  creatinine levels.  Taken  together,  the  Child  classification  and  the MELD score complement each other and provide an accurate assessment of the risk of surgery in cirrhotic patients.<ref>(O’Leary and Friedman, 2007; O’Leary et al., 2009)</ref>

==History==
Dr C.G. Child and Dr J.G. Turcotte of the [[University of Michigan]] first proposed the scoring system in 1964.<ref>Child CG, Turcotte JG. Surgery and portal hypertension. In: The liver and portal hypertension. Edited by CG Child. Philadelphia: Saunders 1964:50-64.</ref> It was modified by Pugh ''et al'' in 1972.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pugh RN, Murray-Lyon IM, Dawson JL, Pietroni MC, Williams R |title=Transection of the oesophagus for bleeding oesophageal varices |journal=The British journal of surgery |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=646–9 |year=1973 |pmid=4541913|doi=10.1002/bjs.1800600817}}</ref> They replaced Child's criterion of nutritional status with the [[prothrombin time]] or INR, and thus eliminated the most subjective part of the score.
