An '''ovarian cyst''' is any collection of fluid, surrounded by a very thin wall, within an [[ovary]].<ref name="Ashby-2004" /> Any [[ovarian follicle]] that is larger than about two centimeters is termed an ovarian cyst. Such cysts range in size from as small as a [[pea]] to larger than an orange.

Most ovarian cysts are functional in nature and harmless ([[benign]]).<ref name="Ashby-2004">{{cite book|author=Ashby, Karen L.|chapter=Ovarian Cyst|title=Encyclopedia of Women's Health|editors=Loue, Sana & Sajatovic, Martha|publisher=Springer|year=2004|isbn=9780306480737|page=476|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LbHWgd-mDbsC&pg=PA476}}</ref><ref name=eMedHealth>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/ovarian_cysts/article_em.htm |title=Ovarian Cysts Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment |work=eMedicineHealth.com |accessdate=}}

Ovarian cysts affect women of all ages.  They occur most often, however, during a woman's childbearing years.

Some ovarian cysts cause problems, such as bleeding and pain.  Surgery may be required to remove cysts larger than 5 centimeters in diameter.

==Classification==

=== Functional cysts ===
Functional ovarian cysts are usually of one of two types:<ref>[http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-questions/functional-ovarian-cysts Functional ovarian cysts] at Cancer Research UK. Retrieved July 2012</ref>
*[[Follicular cyst of ovary|Follicular cyst]], the most common type of ovarian cyst.
*[[Corpus luteum cyst]] they are of two types

=== Non-functional cysts ===

There are several other conditions affecting the [[ovary]] that are described as types of [[cyst]]s, but are not usually grouped with the functional cysts. (Some of these are more commonly or more properly known by other names.) These include:

* A polycystic-appearing ovary is diagnosed based on its enlarged size — usually twice normal —with small cysts present around the outside of the ovary.  It can be found in "normal" women, and in women with endocrine disorders.  An [[ultrasound]] is used to view the ovary in diagnosing the condition.  Polycystic-appearing [[ovary]] is different from the [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]], which includes other symptoms in addition to the presence of ovarian cysts.
* [[Chocolate cyst of ovary]]: An ''endometrioma'', ''endometrioid cyst'', ''endometrial cyst'', or ''chocolate cyst'' is caused by [[endometriosis]], and formed when a tiny patch of endometrial tissue (the [[mucous membrane]] that makes up the inner layer of the uterine wall) bleeds, sloughs off, becomes transplanted, and grows and enlarges inside the ovaries.
* Haemorrhagic ovarian cyst
* [[Dermoid cyst]]
* [[Ovarian serous cystadenoma]]
* Ovarian [[mucinous cystadenoma]]
* [[Paraovarian cyst]]
* Cystic adenofibroma
* Borderline tumoral cysts

==Signs and symptoms==

Some or all of the following symptoms<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ovarian-cysts/DS00129/DSECTION=2 |title=Ovarian cysts: Symptoms |format= |work= MayoClinic.com |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ovarian Cysts - FAQs|url=http://www.4woman.gov//faq/ovarian_cysts.htm|publisher=Womenshealth.gov|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081024155418/http://www.4woman.gov//faq/ovarian_cysts.htm|archivedate=24 Oct 2008|date=23 September 2008}}</ref>

*Dull aching, or severe, sudden, and sharp pain or discomfort in the lower [[abdomen]] (one or both sides), [[pelvis]], [[vagina]], [[lower back]], or thighs; pain may be constant or intermittent—this is the most common symptom
*Fullness, heaviness, pressure, swelling, or [[bloating]] in the abdomen
*Breast tenderness
*Pain during or shortly after beginning or end of menstrual period.
*Irregular periods, or abnormal uterine bleeding or spotting
*Change in frequency or ease of [[urination]] (such as inability to fully empty the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]), or difficulty with [[bowel movement]]s due to pressure on adjacent [[pelvic]] anatomy
*Weight gain
*Nausea or vomiting
*[[Fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]]
*[[Infertility]]
*Increased level of hair growth
*Increased [[facial hair]] or [[body hair]]
*Headaches
*Strange pains in ribs, which feel muscular
*Bloating
*Strange nodules that feel like bruises under the layer of skin

==Diagnosis==

Ovarian cysts are usually diagnosed by either [[ultrasound]] or [[CT scan]]. Follow-up imaging for women of reproductive age  with small simple or hemorrhagic cyst is generally not required.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=D|coauthors=Brown, DL; Andreotti, RF; Benacerraf, B; Benson, CB; Brewster, WR; Coleman, B; DePriest, P; Doubilet, PM; Goldstein, SR; Hamper, UM; Hecht, JL; Horrow, M; Hur, HC; Marnach, M; Patel, MD; Platt, LD; Puscheck, E; Smith-Bindman, R; Society of Radiologists in, Ultrasound|title=Management of asymptomatic ovarian and other adnexal cysts imaged at US Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound consensus conference statement.|journal=Ultrasound quarterly|date=2010 Sep|volume=26|issue=3|pages=121–31|pmid=20823748}}</ref>

==Treatment==
About 95% of ovarian cysts are [[benign]], meaning they are not cancerous.<ref>http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Ovarian-cyst/Pages/Symptoms.aspx</ref>

Treatment for cysts depends on the size of the cyst and symptoms.

Pain caused by ovarian cysts may be treated with:

*[[Pain reliever]]s, including [[acetaminophen|acetaminophen/paracetamol]] ([[Tylenol]] or [[Panadol]]), [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] such as [[ibuprofen]] ([[Motrin]], [[Advil]]),  or [[narcotic]] pain medicine (by prescription) may help reduce pelvic pain.<ref name=MedOnline/>  NSAIDs usually work best when taken at the first signs of the pain.

*A warm bath, or [[heating pad]], or [[hot water bottle]] applied to the lower abdomen near the ovaries can relax tense muscles and relieve cramping, lessen discomfort, and stimulate circulation and healing in the ovaries.<ref>[http://www.lakeside.ca/Patient_Info/ovarian_cysts.htm]</ref>  Bags of ice covered with towels can be used alternately as cold treatments to increase local circulation.<ref name="209.85.165.104">[http://www.answers.com/topic/ovarian-cyst]</ref>

*Combined methods of [[hormonal contraception]] such as the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] – the hormones in the pills may regulate the menstrual cycle, prevent the formation of follicles that can turn into cysts, and possibly shrink an existing cyst.  (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 1999c; Mayo Clinic, 2002e)<ref name=MedOnline>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicineonline.com/topics/O/2/Ovarian-Cysts/info/Treatment-&-Monitoring.html |title=Ovarian Cysts Treatment & Monitoring |work=Medicine Online |accessdate=}}</ref>

Also, limiting strenuous activity may reduce the risk of cyst rupture or torsion.

Cysts that persist beyond two or three [[menstrual cycle]]s, or occur in post-[[menopausal]] women, may indicate more serious disease and should be investigated through [[ultrasonography]] and [[laparoscopy]], especially in cases where family members have had [[ovarian cancer]].  Such cysts may require surgical [[biopsy]].  Additionally, a [[blood test]] may be taken before surgery to check for elevated [[CA-125]], a [[tumor marker]], which is often found in increased levels in ovarian cancer, although it can also be elevated by other conditions resulting in a large number of false positives.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|007217|CA-125}}</ref>

For more serious cases where cysts are large and persisting, doctors may suggest surgery.  Some surgeries can be performed to successfully remove the cyst(s) without hurting the ovaries, while others may require removal of one or both ovaries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fcs.tamu.edu/health/health_education_rural_outreach/Health_Hints/2003/jan-feb/gynecologic_health.php |title=HealthHints: Gynecologic Health (January/February, 2003) |format= |work=Texas AgriLife Extension Service: HealthHints |accessdate=}}</ref>
