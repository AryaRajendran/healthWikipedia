The '''plague doctor's costume''' was the clothing worn by a [[plague doctor]] to protect him from airborne diseases. The costume consisted of an ankle length overcoat and a bird-like beak mask often filled with sweet or strong smelling substances (commonly lavender), along with gloves, boots, a brim hat and an outer over-clothing garment.<ref name="BodySystems">Pommerville (Body Systems), p. 15

==Description==
The mask had glass openings for the eyes and a curved beak shaped like that of a bird. Straps held the beak in front of the doctor's nose.<ref name="Ellis202"/> The mask had two small nose holes and was a type of [[respirator]] which contained aromatic items.<ref>Time-Life Books, pp. 140, 158

:As may be seen on picture here,
:In Rome the doctors do appear,
:When to their patients they are called,
:In places by the plague appalled,
:Their hats and cloaks, of fashion new,
:Are made of oilcloth, dark of hue,
:Their caps with glasses are designed,
:Their bills with antidotes all lined,
:That foulsome air may do no harm,
:Nor cause the doctor man alarm,
:The staff in hand must serve to show
:Their noble trade where'er they go.<ref>

The Genevese physician [[Jean-Jacques Manget]], in his 1721 work ''Treatise on the Plague''  written just after the [[Great Plague of Marseille]], describes the costume worn by plague doctors at [[Nijmegen]] in 1636-1637. The costume forms the frontispiece of Manget's 1721 work.<ref>Manget, p. 3</ref> The plague doctors of Nijmegen also wore beaked masks. Their robes, [[leggings]], hats, and gloves were made of [[morocco leather]].<ref>Timbs, p. 360</ref>

[[File:Beak doctor mask.jpg|thumb|upright|A beaked [[Carnival of Venice|Venetian carnival]] mask with the inscription ''Medico della Peste'' (‘Plague doctor’) beneath the right eye]]

This costume was also worn by plague doctors during the Plague of 1656, which killed 145,000 people in Rome and 300,000 in Naples.<ref name="jhmasextract276">[http://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/content/XX/3/276.extract The Plague Doctor]</ref> The costume terrified people because it was a sign of imminent death. Plague doctors wore these protective costumes in accordance with [[plague doctor contract|their agreements]] when they attended their plague patients.

==Culture==
The costume is also associated with a ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' character called ''Il Medico della Peste'' (the Plague Doctor), who wears a distinctive [[Venetian mask#Medico della Peste (The Plague Doctor)|plague doctor's mask]].<ref>Killinger, p. 95</ref> The Venetian mask was normally white, consisting of a hollow beak and round eye-holes covered with clear glass, and is one of the distinctive masks worn during the [[Carnival of Venice]].<ref name="Carnevale">[http://www.carnavalexhibit.org/venice.php Carnevale]</ref>

The web-based collaborative writing community known as [http://thefearmythos.com/ ''The Fear Mythos''] includes a character named [http://thefearmythos.wikia.com/wiki/The_Plague_Doctor The Plague Doctor], who wears the traditional plague doctor costume with beaked mask.
