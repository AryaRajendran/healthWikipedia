The visible part of the '''human [[nose]]''' is the protruding part of the [[face]] that bears the [[nostril]]s. The shape of the nose is determined by the [[ethmoid bone]] and the [[nasal septum]], which consists mostly of [[cartilage]] and which separates the nostrils. On average the nose of a [[male]] is larger than that of a [[female]].<ref name="Jean" />

The nose has an area of specialised cells which are responsible for [[smelling]] (part of the [[olfactory system]]). Another function of the nose is the conditioning of inhaled air, warming it and making it more humid. Hairs inside the nose prevent large particles from entering the lungs. [[Sneezing]] is usually caused by foreign particles irritating the nasal mucosa, but can more rarely be caused by sudden exposure to bright light (called the [[photic sneeze reflex]]) or touching the [[external auditory canal]]. Sneezing is a means of [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitting infections]] because it creates [[aerosols]] in which the [[droplets]] can harbour [[microbes]].

==Anatomy==
{{Main|Anatomy of the human nose}}
The ''nasal root'' is the top of the nose, forming an indentation at the suture where the nasal bones meet the frontal bone. The [[anterior nasal spine]] is the thin projection of bone at the midline on the lower nasal margin, holding the cartilaginous center of the nose.<ref>[http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/glossaryn.htm archaeologyinfo.com > glossary] Retrieved on August 2010</ref> Adult humans have [[nasal hair]]s in the anterior [[nasal passage]].

== Related medical conditions ==
One of the most common medical conditions involving the nose are [[nosebleed]]s (in medicine: epistaxis). Most of them occur in [[Kiesselbach's area]] (synonym: Little's area). [[Nasal congestion]] is a common symptom of infections or other inflammations of the nasal lining (rhinitis), such as in [[allergic rhinitis]] or [[vasomotor rhinitis]] (resulting from [[nasal spray]] abuse). Most of these conditions also cause [[anosmia]], which is the medical term for a loss of smell. This may also occur in other conditions, for example following trauma, in [[Kallmann syndrome]] or [[Parkinson's disease]].

[[Nose-picking]] is a common, mildly [[taboo]] habit. Medical risks include the spread of infections, nosebleeds and, rarely, self-induced perforation of the [[nasal septum]]. The wiping of the nose with the hand, commonly referred to as the "[[allergic salute]]", is also mildly taboo and can result in the spreading of infections as well. Habitual as well as fast or rough nose wiping may also result in a crease (known as a [[transverse nasal crease]] or groove) running across the nose, and can lead to permanent physical deformity observable in childhood and adulthood.<ref name=pray221>{{cite book|last=Pray|first=W.

[[Nose fetishism]] (or nasophilia) is the sexual [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] (or [[paraphilia]]) for the nose. The psychiatric condition of extreme nose picking is termed [[rhinotillexomania]].

The nose is a common site of [[foreign bodies]]. The nose is susceptible to [[frostbite]]. ''Nasal flaring'' is a sign of [[respiratory distress]] that involves widening of the nostrils on inspiration.

Because of the special nature of the blood supply to the human nose and surrounding area, it is possible for retrograde infections from the nasal area to spread to the brain. For this reason, the area from the corners of the mouth to the bridge of the nose, including the nose and [[maxilla]], is known to doctors as the [[danger triangle of the face]].

A [[rhinoplasty]] [[plastic surgery]] for aesthetic surgery Specific systemic diseases, infections or other conditions that may result in destruction of part of the nose (for example, the nasal bridge, or nasal septal perforation) are [[rhinophyma]], [[skin cancer]] (for example, [[basal cell carcinoma]]), [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[tuberculosis]], [[syphilis]], [[leprosy]] and exposure to [[cocaine]], [[chromium]] or toxins. The nose may be stimulated to grow in [[acromegaly]].

[[Samter's triad]] is the simultaneous occurrence in a patient of [[asthma]], [[nasal polyps]] and [[aspirin sensitivity]].

===Neanderthals===
Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum said the large [[Neanderthal]] noses were an adaption to the cold,<ref>{{cite book | last = Finlayson | first = C | title = Neanderthals and modern humans: an ecological and evolutionary perspective | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-521-82087-1 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=TmQ4i1EQ4AYC&pg=PA84 84] }}</ref> Todd C. Rae of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] said primate and arctic animal studies have shown sinus size reduction in areas of extreme cold rather than enlargement in accordance with [[Allen's rule]].<ref name="Rae" />  Therefore, Todd C. Rae concludes that the design of the large and prognathic Neanderthal nose was evolved for the hotter climate of the Middle East and was kept when the Neanderthals entered Europe.<ref name="Rae">Rae, T.C.

Miquel Hernández of the Department of Animal Biology at the [[University of Barcelona]] said the "high and narrow nose of [[Eskimos]]" and "[[Neanderthals]]" is an "adaption to a cold and dry environment", since it contributes to warming and moisturizing the air and the "recovery of heat and moisture from expired air".<ref>Hernández, M., Fox, C.

===Humans===
An article published in the speculative journal ''[[Medical Hypotheses]]'' suggested that the nose is an alteration of the angle of skull following [[human skeletal changes due to bipedalism]]. This changed the shape of the skull base causing, together with change in diet, a knock-on morphological reduction in the relative size of the [[Maxillary sinus|maxillary]] and [[human mandible|mandible]] and through this a "squeezing" of the protrusion of the most anterior parts of the face more forward and so increasing nose prominence and modifying its shape.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Mladina | first = R | coauthors = Skitarelić N; Vuković K | year = 2009 | title = Why do humans have such a prominent nose?

The [[aquatic ape hypothesis]] relates the nose to a hypothesized period of aquatic adaptation in which the downward-facing nostrils and flexible [[philtrum]] prevented water from entering the nasal cavities.<ref name = Morgan1997> {{cite book | last = Morgan | first = Elaine | authorlink = Elaine Morgan (writer) | title = The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis| year = 1997 | publisher = Souvenir Press | isbn = 0-285-63518-2}}</ref> The theory is not generally accepted by mainstream scholars of [[human evolution]].<ref name = Meier>{{cite book | last = Meier | first = R | title = The complete idiot's guide to human prehistory | publisher = Alpha Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-02-864421-2 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=r_Wit4KYSmMC&pg=PA57 57–59]}}</ref>
