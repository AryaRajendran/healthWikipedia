==Disputes with drug manufacturers==

In November 2006, AHF asked Indian anti-HIV drug manufacturer [[Cipla]] to reduce the price of its combination drug [[Viraday]] from its launch price of about Rs 62,000 per year. Cipla CEO Y. K. Hamied cited taxes and custom duties on raw materials as reasons for the high price, but agreed to a price cut.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report_cipla-cuts-aids-drug-price_1064299|last=Balakrishnan|first=Reghu|title=Cipla cuts AIDS drug price|work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|date=15 November 2006|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref>

In January 2007, AHF filed suit in Los Angeles over [[Pfizer]]'s direct to consumer marketing of [[Viagra]], accusing Pfizer of promoting off-label, recreational use of Viagra, and suggesting a link between Viagra, [[methamphetamine]], and unsafe sex. Pfizer denied AHF's claims, and mentioned that AHF had recently asked Pfizer to fund a meth educational program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=1504|last=Roehr|first=Bob|title=Pfizer sued over Viagra ads|work=[[Bay Area Reporter]]|date=25 January 2007|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref>

In August 2007, AHF began purchasing full-page ads in Indian newspapers accusing Cipla of overpricing. According to AHF, a year's worth of Viraday cost Rs 54,000 when sold in India, but only Rs 21,000 when exported to Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/MRTPC_lens_on_Ciplas_AIDS_drugs_for_Africa/articleshow/2296369.cms|title=MRTPC lens on Cipla’s AIDS drugs for Africa|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=21 August 2007|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> Some NGOs declined to join AHF in criticizing Cipla's drug prices, citing a potential conflict of interest: Cipla's opposition to the patent application for [[Viread]], a component of Viraday, filed by AHF contributor [[Gilead Sciences]]. Gilead denied involvement in AHF's complaint, and an AHF regional chief stated that AHF also opposed Gilead's patent application for Viread.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/Healthcare__Biotech/Pharmaceuticals/Anti-AIDS_blitz_sees_pharma_firms_locked_in_ugly_battle/rssarticleshow/2328352.cms|last=Singh|first=Khomba|title=Anti-AIDS blitz sees pharma firms locked in ugly battle|work=The Economic Times|date=1 September 2007|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>

==Condom laws and disputes with Los Angeles County==
In 2004, [[Darren James]] and three other adult film actors tested positive for HIV. In response to the outbreak, AHF began lobbying in favor of laws requiring condom use by male actors during sex scenes in adult films.<ref name="laweekly">{{cite journal|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2010-01-28/news/rubbers-revolutionary-aids-healthcare-foundation-s-michael-weinstein/|last=McDonald|first=Patrick Range|title=Rubbers Revolutionary: AIDS Healthcare Foundation’s Michael Weinstein|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=28 January 2010|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2010, AHF unsuccessfully sued the [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] government to compel its health department to mandate condom use in adult film productions.<ref name="laweekly" />

In 2012, AHF supported a Los Angeles city ordinance requiring condoms in certain adult films.<ref>{{cite web|last=O’Neill|first=Stephanie|url=http://blogs.kqed.org/election2012/2012/10/12/los-angeles-measure-b-mandating-condom-use-in-adult-films/|title=Los Angeles Measure B: Mandating Condom Use in Adult Films|work=The California Report|publisher=[[KQED]]|date=12 October 2012|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> Later the same year, the organization spent US$1,654,681 funding the successful campaign to pass [[Measure B]], a ballot initiative that expanded the condom requirement countywide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votersedge.org/los-angeles/ballot-measures/2012/november/measure-b|title=Measure B: Safer Sex in The Adult Film Industry|work=Voter's Edge|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>

AHF again sued the Los Angeles County government, alleging that an August 2012 audit conducted by the county was an illegal retaliation for AHF's support for Measure B.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://file.lacounty.gov/Auditor/audit_reports/Public%20Health/cms1_182682.pdf|last=Watanabe|first=Wendy L.|title=Audit of AIDS Healthcare Foundation|publisher=Los Angeles County Auditor-Controller|date=16 August 2012|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/12/10/52965.htm|last=Reynolds|first=Matt|title=AIDS Group Says L.A.
