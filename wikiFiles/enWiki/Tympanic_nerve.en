The '''tympanic nerve''' ('''nerve of Jacobson''') is a branch of the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] found near the ear.

==Path==
It arises from the [[petrous ganglion]], and ascends to the [[tympanic cavity]] through a small canal, the fossula petrosa/tympanic canaliculus, on the under surface of the petrous portion of the [[temporal bone]] on the ridge which separates the [[carotid canal]] from the [[jugular fossa]]. 

In the tympanic cavity it divides into branches which form the [[tympanic plexus]] and are contained in grooves upon the surface of the promontory. 

Jacobson's nerve contains both sensory and secretory fibers. 
* Sensory fibers supply the middle ear.
* Parasympathetic secretory fibers continue as the [[Lesser petrosal nerve|Lesser Petrosal nerve]] and provide secretomotor innervation to the parotid gland. The secretory fibers enter the [[otic ganglion]]. 
* Sympathetic fibers (for the large [[deep petrosal nerve]]) through communication with the [[carotid plexus]]

The [[postganglionic]] [[parasympathetic]] fibers are then distributed via the [[auriculotemporal nerve]] (branch of the [[trigeminal nerve]]) to the [[parotid gland]].

==Clinical significance==
This nerve may be involved by [[paraganglioma]], in this location referred to as glomus jugulare or glomus tympanicum tumours.
