'''Spina bifida''' ([[Latin]]: "split spine") is a developmental [[congenital disorder]] caused by the incomplete closing of the [[embryo]]nic [[neural tube]]. Some [[vertebrae]] overlying the [[spinal cord]] are not fully formed and remain unfused and open. If the opening is large enough, this allows a portion of the spinal cord to protrude through the opening in the bones. There may or may not be a fluid-filled sac surrounding the spinal cord. Other neural tube defects include [[anencephaly]], a condition in which the portion of the neural tube that will become the [[cerebrum]] does not close, and [[encephalocele]], which results when other parts of the brain remain unfused.

Spina bifida malformations fall into three categories: spina bifida occulta, spina bifida cystica with meningocele, and spina bifida cystica with myelomeningocele. The most common location of the malformations is the [[lumbar]] and [[sacrum|sacral]] areas. Myelomeningocele is the most significant and common form, and this leads to disability in most affected individuals. The terms spina bifida and myelomeningocele are usually used interchangeably.

Spina bifida can be surgically closed after birth, but this does not restore normal function to the affected part of the spinal cord. [[Fetal surgery|Intrauterine surgery]] for spina bifida has also been performed, and the safety and efficacy of this procedure are currently being investigated. A study conducted with mothers who had prior spina bifida births indicates the incidence of spina bifida can be decreased by up to 70% when the mother takes daily [[folic acid]] supplements prior to [[Conception (biology)|conception]].  

Spina bifida is one of the most common birth defects with a worldwide incidence of about 1 in every 1000 births.

===Spina bifida occulta===
''Occulta'' is [[Latin]] for "hidden". This is the mildest form of spina bifida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinabifidaassociation.org/site/pp.aspx?c=liKWL7PLLrF&b=2700309|title=Are There Different Types Of Spina Bifida?|publisher=SBA|aasssccessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>

Many people with this type of spina bifida do not even know they have it, as the condition is asymptomatic in most cases.<ref name="SBASBO"/> The incidence of spina bifida occulta is approximately 10% of the population,<ref name="pmcid1261979">{{cite journal |author=Saluja PG |title=The incidence of spina bifida occulta in a historic and a modern London population |journal=J Anat. |volume=158 |pages=91–93 |year=1988 |pmc=1261979 |pmid=3066791}}</ref> and most people are diagnosed incidentally from spinal X-rays.

===Meningocele===

The least common form of spina bifida is a posterior meningocele (or meningeal cyst).  In this form, the vertebrae develop normally, but the [[meninges]] are forced into the gaps between the vertebrae. As the nervous system remains undamaged, individuals with meningocele are unlikely to suffer long-term health problems, although cases of [[Tethered Spinal Cord syndrome|tethered cord]] have been reported.  Causes of meningocele include [[teratoma]] and other [[tumor]]s of the [[sacrococcygeal teratoma|sacrococcyx]] and of the [[presacral space]], and [[Currarino syndrome]].

A meningocele may also form through dehiscences in the base of the skull. These may be classified by their localisation to occipital, frontoethmoidal, or nasal. Endonasal meningoceles lie at the roof of the [[nasal cavity]] and may be mistaken for a [[nasal polyp]]. They are treated surgically. Encephalomeningoceles are classified in the same way and also contain brain tissue.

===Myelomeningocele===
This type of spina bifida often results in the most severe complications.<ref name="NIH">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001558.htm|title=Myelomeningocele|accessdate=2008-06-06 |publisher=NIH}}</ref> In individuals with myelomeningocele, the unfused portion of the spinal column allows the spinal cord to protrude through an opening. The meningeal membranes that cover the spinal cord form a sac enclosing the spinal elements. 

===Myeloschisis===
Spina bifida with myeloschisis is the most severe form of myelomeningocele. In this type, the involved area is represented by a flattened, plate-like mass of nervous tissue with no overlying membrane. The exposure of these nerves and tissues make the baby more prone to life-threatening infections such as [[meningitis]].<ref>Mayo Clinic</ref>

The protruding portion of the spinal cord and the nerves that originate at that level of the cord are damaged or not properly developed. As a result, there is usually some degree of [[paralysis]] and loss of sensation below the level of the spinal cord defect. Thus, the more cranial the level of the defect, the more severe the associated nerve dysfunction and resultant paralysis may be. People may have ambulatory problems, loss of sensation, deformities of the hips, knees or feet, and loss of muscle tone.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Physical complications===
Physical signs of spina bifida may include:
* Leg weakness and paralysis<ref name=Mitchell>{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=L. E.|coauthors=Adzick, N. S., Melchionne, J., Pasquariello, P. S., Sutton, L. N., & Whitehead, A. S. |title=Spina bifida|journal=Lancet|year=2004|volume=364|pages=1885–1895|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17445-X|pmid=15555669|issue=9448}}</ref>
* Orthopedic abnormalities (i.e., [[club foot]], [[dislocation of hip|hip dislocation]], [[scoliosis]])<ref name="Mitchell" />
* Bladder and bowel control problems, including incontinence, [[urinary tract infections]], and poor renal function<ref name="Mitchell" />
* [[bedsore|Pressure sores]] and skin irritations<ref name="Mitchell" />
* Abnormal eye movement<ref name="Juranek & Salman">{{cite journal|last=Juranek|first=J|coauthors=Salman MS|title=Anomalous development of brain structure and function in spina bifida myelomeningocele|journal=Developmental Disabilities|year=2010|volume=16|series=1|pages=23–30|doi=10.1002/ddrr.88}}</ref>

68% of children with spina bifida have an [[allergy]] to [[latex]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/1206-protect_yourself_from_latex_allergies.htm|title=Protect Yourself From Latex Allergies: Plant Biologists And Immunochemists Develop Hypoallergenic Alternative To Latex|accessdate=12 October 2012|date=1 December 2008|work=[[Science Daily]]}}</ref> ranging from mild to life-threatening. The common use of latex in medical facilities makes this a particularly serious concern. The most common approach to avoid developing an allergy is to avoid contact with latex-containing products such as examination gloves and condoms and [[catheters]] that do not specify they are latex free, and many other products, such as some commonly used by dentists.<ref name="emedicine"/>

The spinal cord lesion or the scarring due to surgery may result in a [[Tethered spinal cord syndrome|tethered spinal cord]]. In some individuals, this causes significant traction and stress on the spinal cord and can lead to a worsening of associated paralysis, [[scoliosis]], back pain, and worsening bowel and/or bladder function.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aans.org/Patient%20Information/Conditions%20and%20Treatments/Tethered%20Spinal%20Cord%20Syndrome.aspx |title=Tethered Spinal Cord Syndrome |publisher=AANS |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref>

===Neurological complications===
Many individuals with spina bifida have an associated abnormality of the [[cerebellum]], called the [[Arnold Chiari II malformation]]. In affected individuals, the back portion of the brain is displaced from the back of the skull down into the upper neck. In about 90% of the people with myelomeningocele, [[hydrocephalus]] also occurs because the displaced cerebellum interferes with the normal flow of [[cerebrospinal fluid]], causing an excess of the fluid to accumulate.<ref name=NINDS>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/chiari/detail_chiari.htm#186143087 |title=Chiari Malformation Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |publisher=Ninds.nih.gov |date=2011-09-16 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> In fact, the cerebellum also tends to be smaller in individuals with spina bifida, especially for those with higher lesion levels.<ref name="Juranek & Salman"/> 

The [[corpus callosum]] is abnormally developed in 70-90% of individuals with spina bifida myelomeningocele; this impacts the communication processes between the left and right brain hemispheres.<ref name="Barkovich 2005">{{cite book|last=Barkovich|first=J|title=Pediatric Neuroimaging|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkens|location=Philadelphia, PA}}</ref> Further, [[white matter]] tracts connecting posterior brain regions with anterior regions appear less organized. White matter tracts between frontal regions have also been found to be impaired.<ref name="Juranek & Salman"/>

[[Cerebral cortex|Cortex]] abnormalities may also be present. For example, [[frontal lobe|frontal regions]] of the brain tend to be thicker than expected, while posterior and parietal regions are thinner. Thinner sections of the brain are also associated with increased cortical folding.<ref name="Juranek & Salman"/> Neurons within the cortex may also be displaced.<ref name=Wills />

====Executive function====
Several studies have demonstrated difficulties with [[executive functions]] in youth with spina bifida,<ref name=Burmeister>{{cite journal|last=Burmeister|first=R|coauthors=Hannay HJ, Copeland K, Fletcher JM, Boudousquie A, & Dennis M|title=Attention problems and executive functions in children with spina bifida and hydrocephalus|journal=Child Neuropsychology|year=2005|volume=11|pages=265–283|doi=10.1080/092970490911324|issue=3|pmid=16036451}}</ref><ref name="Tarazi 2008">{{cite journal|last=Tarazi|first=RA|coauthors=Zabel TA, & Mahone EM|title=Age-related changes in executive function among children with spina bifida/hydrocephalus based on parent behavior ratings|journal=The Clinical Neuropsychologist|year=2008|volume=22|issue=4|pages=585–602|doi=10.1080/13854040701425940|pmid=17853154|pmc=2575658}}</ref> with greater deficits observed in youth with shunted hydrocephalus.<ref name="Fletcher et al 1996">{{cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=JM|title=Attentional skills and executive functions in children with early hydrocephalus|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|year=1996|volume=12|pages=53–76|author-separator=,|author2=Brookshire BL|author3=Landry SH|author4=Bohan TP|author5=Davidson KC|author6=Francis DJ|display-authors=5|doi=10.1080/87565649609540640|last7=Levin|first7=Harvey S.|last8=Brandt|first8=Michael E.|last9=Kramer|first9=Larry A.}}</ref> Unlike typically developing children, youths with spina bifida do not tend to improve in their executive functioning as they grow older.<ref name="Tarazi 2008" /> Specific areas of difficulty in some individuals include planning, organizing, initiating, and [[working memory]].

Although executive functions are often attributed to the [[frontal lobe]]s of the brain, individuals with spina bifida have intact frontal lobes; therefore, other areas of the brain may be implicated.<ref name="Fletcher et al 1996" />

Individuals with spina bifida, especially those with shunted hydrocephalus, often have attention problems. Children with spina bifida and shunted hydrocephalus have higher rates of [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] than typically developing children (31% vs. 17%).<ref name=Burmeister /> Deficits have been observed for selective attention and focused attention, although poor motor speed may contribute to poor scores on tests of attention.<ref name="Fletcher et al 1996" /><ref name="Rose Holmbeck">{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=BM|coauthors=Holmbeck GN|title=Attention and executive functions in adolescents with spina bifida|journal=Journal of Pediatric Psychology|year=2007|volume=32|issue=8|pages=983–994|doi=10.1093/jpepsy/jsm042|pmid=17556398}}</ref> Attention deficits may be evident at a very early age, as [[infant]]s with spina bifida lag behind their peers in orienting to faces.<ref name="Landry et al">{{cite journal|last=Landry|first=SH|coauthors=Robinson SS, Copeland D, & Garner PW|title=Goal-directed behavior and perception of self-competence in children with spina bifida|journal=Journal of Pediatric Psychology|year=1993|volume=18|issue=3|pages=389–396|doi=10.1093/jpepsy/18.3.389|pmid=8340846}}</ref>

====Academic skills====
Individuals with spina bifida may struggle academically, especially in the subjects of [[mathematics]] and [[reading (process)|reading]]. In one study, 60% of children with spina bifida were diagnosed with a learning disability.<ref name=Mayes_Calhoun>{{cite journal|last=Mayes|first=SD|coauthors=Calhoun, SL|title=Frequency of reading, math, and writing disabilities in children with clinical disorders|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|year=2006|volume=16|issue=2|pages=145–157|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2005.07.004}}</ref> In addition to brain abnormalities directly related to various academic skills, achievement is likely affected by impaired attentional control and executive functioning.<ref name=Wills>{{cite journal|last=Wills|first=KE|title=Neuropsychological functioning in children with spina bifida and/or hydrocephalus|journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology|year=1993|volume=22|issue=2|pages=247–265|doi=10.1207/s15374424jccp2202_11}}</ref> Children with spina bifida may perform well in elementary school, but begin to struggle as academic demands increase.

==Pathophysiology==
Spina bifida is caused by the failure of the [[neural tube]] to close during the first month of [[embryo]]nic development (often before the mother knows she is pregnant).

Under normal circumstances, the closure of the neural tube occurs around the 23rd (rostral closure) and 27th (caudal closure) day after [[fertilization]].<ref name="paediatrics"/> However, if something interferes and the tube fails to close properly, a neural tube defect will occur. Medications such as some [[anticonvulsants]], [[diabetes]], having a relative with spina bifida, [[obesity]], and an increased body temperature from [[fever]] or external sources such as hot tubs and electric blankets may increase the chances of delivery of a baby with a spina bifida.

Extensive evidence from mouse strains with spina bifida indicates that there is sometimes a genetic basis for the condition. Human spina bifida, like other human diseases, such as [[cancer]], [[hypertension]] and [[atherosclerosis]] (coronary artery disease), likely results from the interaction of multiple [[gene]]s and environmental factors.

Research has shown the lack of [[folic acid]] (folate) is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects, including spina bifida. Supplementation of the mother's diet with folate can reduce the incidence of neural tube defects by about 70%, and can also decrease the severity of these defects when they occur.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holmes LB |title=Does taking vitamins at the time of conception prevent neural tube defects? |journal=JAMA |volume=260 |issue=21 |page=3181 |year=1988 |pmid=3184398|doi=10.1001/jama.260.21.3181}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Milunsky A |title=Multivitamin/folic acid supplementation in early pregnancy reduces the prevalence of neural tube defects |journal=JAMA |volume=262 |issue=20 |pages=2847–52 |year=1989 |pmid=2478730|doi=10.1001/jama.262.20.2847 |author-separator=, |author2=Jick H |author3=Jick SS |display-authors=3 |last4=Bruell |first4=CL |last5=MacLaughlin |first5=DS |last6=Rothman |first6=KJ |last7=Willett |first7=W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mulinare J, Cordero JF, Erickson JD, Berry RJ |title=Periconceptional use of multivitamins and the occurrence of neural tube defects |journal=JAMA |volume=260 |issue=21 |pages=3141–5 |year=1988 |pmid=3184392|doi=10.1001/jama.260.21.3141}}</ref> It is unknown how or why folic acid has this effect.

Spina bifida does not follow direct patterns of [[heredity]] like [[muscular dystrophy]] or [[haemophilia]]. Studies show a woman having had one child with a neural tube defect such as spina bifida has about a 3% risk of having another child with a [[neural tube defect]]. This risk can be reduced to about 1% if the woman takes high doses (4 [[milligram|mg]]/day) of folic acid before and during pregnancy. For the general population, low-dose folic acid supplements are advised (0.4&nbsp;mg/day).{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

There is neither a single cause of spina bifida nor any known way to prevent it entirely. However, dietary supplementation with [[folic acid]] has been shown to be helpful in reducing the incidence of spina bifida. Sources of folic acid include [[whole grain]]s, fortified [[breakfast cereal]]s, dried [[bean]]s, [[leaf vegetable]]s and [[fruit]]s.<ref>{{cite web | title=Folic Acid Fortification | url=http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/wh-folic.html | year=1996 | month=February | publisher=FDA}}</ref>

Folate fortification of enriched grain products has been mandatory in the United States since 1998.

===Pregnancy screening===

Neural tube defects can usually be detected during pregnancy by testing the mother's blood ([[AFP screening]]) or a detailed fetal [[ultrasound]]. Increased levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) should be followed up by two tests - an [[ultrasound]] of the fetal spine and [[amniocentesis]] of the mother's amniotic fluid (to test for [[alpha-fetoprotein]] and [[acetylcholinesterase]]). Spina bifida may be associated with other malformations as in dysmorphic syndromes, often resulting in spontaneous [[miscarriage]]. In the majority of cases, though, spina bifida is an isolated malformation.

[[Genetic counseling]] and further [[genetic testing]], such as amniocentesis, may be offered during the pregnancy, as some neural tube defects are associated with genetic disorders such as [[trisomy 18]]. Ultrasound screening for spina bifida is partly responsible for the decline in new cases, because many pregnancies are [[abortion|terminated]] out of fear that a newborn might have a poor future [[quality of life]]. With modern medical care, the quality of life of patients has greatly improved.<ref name="paediatrics"/>

==Treatment==
There is no known cure for nerve damage caused by spina bifida. To prevent further damage of the nervous tissue and to prevent infection, [[pediatric]] [[neurosurgeons]] operate to close the opening on the back. The spinal cord and its nerve roots are put back inside the spine and covered with [[meninges]]. In addition, a [[shunt (medical)|shunt]] may be surgically installed to provide a continuous drain for the excess cerebrospinal fluid produced in the brain, as happens with [[hydrocephalus]]. Shunts most commonly drain into the [[abdomen]] or chest wall. However, if spina bifida is detected during pregnancy, then [[fetal surgery|open or minimally-invasive fetal surgery]] can be performed.<ref name=NINDS />

===In childhood===

Most individuals with myelomeningocele will need periodic evaluations by a variety of specialists:<ref name="Gillette Children's">{{cite web|title=Center for Spina Bifida: Specialists and Services|url=http://www.gillettechildrens.org/default.cfm?PID=1.17.1.8|work=Gillette Children's Hospital Center for Spina Bifida|publisher=Gillette Children's Hospital|accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref>

===Transition to adulthood===

Although many [[children's hospital]]s feature integrated multidisciplinary teams to coordinate healthcare of youth with spina bifida, the transition to adult healthcare can be difficult because the above healthcare professionals operate independently of each other, requiring separate appointments and communicate among each other much less frequently. Healthcare professionals working with adults may also be less knowledgeable about spina bifida because it is considered a childhood chronic health condition.<ref name="Binks et al">{{cite journal|last=Binks|first=JA|coauthors=Barden WS, Burke TA, & Young NL|title=What do we really know about the transition to adult-centered health care? A focus on cerebral palsy and spina bifida|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|year=2007|volume=88|issue=8|pages=1064–1073|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.04.018|pmid=17678671}}</ref> Due to the potential difficulties of the transition, adolescents with spina bifida and their families are encouraged to begin to prepare for the transition around ages 14–16, although this may vary depending on the adolescent's cognitive and physical abilities and available family support. The transition itself should be gradual and flexible. The adolescent's multidisciplinary treatment team may aid in the process by preparing comprehensive, up-to-date documents detailing the adolescent's medical care, including information about medications, surgery, therapies, and recommendations. A transition plan and aid in identifying adult healthcare professionals are also helpful to include in the transition process.<ref name="Binks et al" /> 

Further complicating the transition process is the tendency for youths with spina bifida to be delayed in the development of autonomy,<ref name="Davis et al 2006">{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=BE|coauthors=Shurtleff DB, Walker WO, Seidel KD, & Duguay S|title=Acquisition of autonomy skills in adolescents with myelomeningocele|journal=Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology|year=2006|volume=48|issue=4|pages=253–258|doi=10.1017/S0012162206000569}}</ref> with boys particularly at risk for slower development of independence.<ref name="Friedman 2009">{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=D|coauthors=Holmbeck GN, DeLucia C, Jandasek B, & Zebracki K|title=Trajectories of autonomy development across the adolescent transition in children with spina bifida|journal=Rehabilitation Psychology|year=2009|volume=54|issue=1|pages=16–27|doi=10.1037/a0014279|pmid=19618699}}</ref> An increased dependence on others (in particular family members) may interfere with the adolescent's self-management of health-related tasks, such as catheterization, bowel management, and taking medications.<ref name="Monsen 1992">{{cite journal|last=Monsen|first=RB|title=Autonomy, coping, and self-care agency in healthy adolescents and in adolescents with spina bifida|journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing|year=1992|volume=7|issue=1|pages=9–13|pmid=1548569}}</ref> As part of the transition process, it is beneficial to begin discussions at an early age about educational and vocational goals, independent living, and community involvement.<ref name="Holmbeck & Devine 2010">{{cite journal|last=Holmbeck|first=GN|coauthors=Devine KA|title=Psychosocial and family functioning in spina bifida|journal=Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews|year=2010|volume=16|issue=1|pages=40–46|doi=10.1002/ddrr.90|pmid=20419770|pmc=2926127}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Spina bifida is one of the most common birth defects, with an average worldwide [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of one to two cases per 1000 births, but certain populations have a significantly greater risk.

In the United States, the average incidence is 0.7 per 1000 live births. The incidence is higher on the East Coast than on the West Coast, and higher in white people (one case per 1000 live births) than in black people (0.1–0.4 case per 1000 live births). Immigrants from Ireland have a higher incidence of spina bifida than do natives.<ref name="Lemire">{{cite journal | author = Lemire RJ | year = 1988 |title = Neural tube defects | url = | journal = [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] | volume = 259 | issue = 4|pages = 558–62 | pmid = 3275817 | doi = 10.1001/jama.259.4.558 }}</ref><ref name="Cotton">{{cite journal | author = Cotton P | year = 1993 | title = Finding neural tube 'zippers' may let geneticists tailor prevention of defects | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 270| issue = 14| pages = 1663–4 | pmid = 8411482 | doi = 10.1001/jama.270.14.1663 }}</ref> Highest rates of the defect in the USA can be found in Hispanic youth.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boulet|first=SL|coauthors=Yang Q, Mai C, Kirby RS, Collins JS, Robbins JM,...Mulinare J|title=Trends in postfortification prevalence of spina bifida and ancephaly in the United States|journal=Birth Defects Research (Part A)|year=2008|volume=82|pages=527–532|doi=10.1002/bdra.20468|issue=7}}</ref> 

The highest incidence rates worldwide were found in Ireland and Wales, where three to four cases of myelomeningocele per 1000 population have been reported during the 1970s, along with more than six cases of [[anencephaly]] (both live births and [[stillbirth]]s) per 1000 population. The reported overall incidence of myelomeningocele in the British Isles was 2.0–3.5 cases per 1000 births.<ref name="Lemire"/><ref name="Cotton"/> Since then, the rate has fallen dramatically with 0.15 per 1000 live births reported in 1998,<ref name="paediatrics">T. Lissauer, G. Clayden. Illustrated Textbook of Paediatrics (Second Edition). Mosby, 2003. ISBN 0-7234-3178-7</ref> though this decline is partially accounted for because some fetuses are aborted when tests show signs of spina bifida (see [[Spina bifida#Pregnancy screening|Pregnancy screening]] above).

Parents of children with spina bifida have an increased risk of having a second child with a neural tube defect.<ref name="Lemire"/><ref name="Cotton"/>

==Fetal surgery research==

1980 - Fetal surgical techniques using animal models were first developed at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] by Dr. Michael R. Harrison, Dr. N. Scott Adzick and research colleagues.

1994 - The surgical model that is most similar to simulating the human disease is the fetal lamb model of myelomeningocele (MMC) introduced by Meuli and Adzick in 1994. The MMC-like defect was surgically created at 75 days of gestation (term 145 to 150 days) by a lumbo-sacral [[laminectomy]]. Approximately 3 weeks after creation of the defect a reversed [[latissimus dorsi]] flap was used to cover the exposed [[neural placode]] and the animals were delivered by cesarean section just prior term. Human MMC-like lesions with similar [[neurological deficit]] were found in the control newborn lambs. In contrast, animals that underwent closure had near-normal neurological function and well-preserved [[cytoarchitecture]] of the covered spinal cord on [[histopathology|histopathological examination]]. Despite mild [[paraparesis]], they were able to stand, walk, perform demanding motor test and demonstrated no signs of incontinence. Furthermore, sensory function of the hind limbs was present clinically and confirmed electrophysiologically. Further studies showed that this model, when combined with a lumbar spinal cord [[myelotomy]] leads to the hindbrain herniation characteristic of the Chiari II malformation and that in utero surgery restores normal hindbrain anatomy by stopping the leak of cerebrospinal fluid through the myelomeningocele lesion.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Meuli|first=M|coauthors=Meuli-Simmen, C; Hutchins, GM; Yingling, CD; Hoffman, KM; Harrison, MR; Adzick, NS|title=In utero surgery rescues neurological function at birth in sheep with spina bifida.|journal=Nature Medicine|date=1995 Apr|volume=1|issue=4|pages=342–7|pmid=7585064|doi=10.1038/nm0495-342}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=11084552|year=2000|last1=Paek|first1=BW|last2=Farmer|first2=DL|last3=Wilkinson|first3=CC|last4=Albanese|first4=CT|last5=Peacock|first5=W|last6=Harrison|first6=MR|last7=Jennings|first7=RW|title=Hindbrain herniation develops in surgically created myelomeningocele but is absent after repair in fetal lambs|volume=183|issue=5|pages=1119–23|doi=10.1067/mob.2000.108867|journal=American journal of obstetrics and gynecology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bouchard|first=S|coauthors=Davey, MG; Rintoul, NE; Walsh, DS; Rorke, LB; Adzick, NS|title=Correction of hindbrain herniation and anatomy of the vermis after in utero repair of myelomeningocele in sheep|journal=Journal of pediatric surgery|date=2003 Mar|volume=38|issue=3|pages=451–8; discussion 451–8|pmid=12632366|doi=10.1053/jpsu.2003.50078}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Meuli|first=M|coauthors=Meuli-Simmen, C; Yingling, CD; Hutchins, GM; Timmel, GB; Harrison, MR; Adzick, NS|title=In utero repair of experimental myelomeningocele saves neurological function at birth|journal=Journal of pediatric surgery|date=1996 Mar|volume=31|issue=3|pages=397–402|pmid=8708911|doi=10.1016/S0022-3468(96)90746-0}}</ref>

Surgeons at [[Vanderbilt University]], led by Dr. Joseph Bruner, attempted to close spina bifida in 4 human fetuses using a skin graft from the mother using a [[laparoscope]]. Four cases were performed before stopping the procedure - two of the four fetuses died. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=JP|coauthors=Richards, WO; Tulipan, NB; Arney, TL|title=Endoscopic coverage of fetal myelomeningocele in utero|journal=American journal of obstetrics and gynecology|date=1999 Jan|volume=180|issue=1 Pt 1|pages=153–8|pmid=9914596|doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(99)70167-5}}</ref>

1998 - Dr. N. Scott Adzick and team at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia performed open fetal surgery for spina bifida in an early gestation fetus (22 week gestation fetus) with a successful outcome. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Adzick|first=N Scott|coauthors=Sutton, Leslie N; Crombleholme, Timothy M; Flake, Alan W|title=Successful fetal surgery for spina bifida|journal=The Lancet|date=NaN undefined NaN|volume=352|issue=9141|pages=1675–1676|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)00070-1}}</ref>

Surgeons at Vanderbilt University, led by Dr. Noel Tulipan, made an incision in the mother's uterus to obtain better exposure to fetuses of 28 to 30 weeks' gestation. All 4 fetuses were born premature but with evidence of reversal of their Chiari II malformation. Only 2 of the 4 required ventricular shunts after birth. Fetal surgery after 25 weeks has not shown benefit in subsequent studies. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Tubbs|first=RS|coauthors=Chambers, MR; Smyth, MD; Bartolucci, AA; Bruner, JP; Tulipan, N; Oakes, WJ|title=Late gestational intrauterine myelomeningocele repair does not improve lower extremity function|journal=Pediatric neurosurgery|date=2003 Mar|volume=38|issue=3|pages=128–32|pmid=12601237|doi=10.1159/000068818}}</ref>

Subsequently, 4 medical centers conducted 253 open spina bifida repairs prior to the MOMs trial. The outcomes were mixed, and the only comparison groups were other children who had not undergone repair after birth in the past.

===MOMS trial===
[[MOMS Trial|Management of Myelomeningocele Study]] (MOMS)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinabifidamoms.com/english/overview.html |title=Background of Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) |publisher=The GWU Biostatistics Center |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00060606 |title=Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) - Full Text View |publisher=ClinicalTrials.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref> is a [[Clinical trial|phase III clinical trial]] to evaluate the safety and efficacy of [[fetal surgery]] to close a myelomeningocele. This involves surgically opening the pregnant mother's abdomen and [[uterus]] to operate on the [[fetus]]. This route of access to the fetus is called [[open fetal surgery]]. The exposed fetal spinal cord is covered in layers with surrounding fetal tissue at mid-gestation (19-25 weeks) to protect it from further damage caused by prolonged exposure to [[amniotic fluid]]. The fetal surgery may decrease some of the damaging effects of the spina bifida, but at some risk to both the fetus and the pregnant woman.

The MOMS trial was closed for [[efficacy]] in December 2010 based on comparing outcomes after prenatal and postnatal repair in 183 patients - 77 patients were treated at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 54 at Vanderbilt University and 52 at The University of California San Francisco. 

The trial demonstrated the outcomes after prenatal spina bifida treatment are improved to the degree that the benefits of the surgery outweigh the maternal risks. Results were reported in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] by Adzick et al.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Adzick|first=NS|title=A Randomized Trial of Prenatal versus Postnatal Repair of Myelomeningocele |journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=February 9, 2011|series=Online First|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1014379#|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1014379 |pmid=21306277|last2=Thom|first2=Elizabeth A.|last3=Spong|first3=Catherine Y.|last4=Brock|first4=John W.|last5=Burrows|first5=Pamela K.|last6=Johnson|first6=Mark P.|last7=Howell|first7=Lori J.|last8=Farrell|first8=Jody A.|last9=Dabrowiak|first9=Mary E.|volume=364|issue=11|pages=993–1004}}</ref>

To be specific, the study found that prenatal repair resulted in:

* Reversal of the hindbrain herniation component of the Chiari II malformation
* Reduced need for ventricular shunting (a procedure in which a thin tube is introduced into the brain’s ventricles to drain fluid and relieve hydrocephalus)
* Reduced incidence or severity of potentially devastating neurologic effects caused by the spine’s exposure to amniotic fluid, such as impaired motor function

In Europe, open fetal surgery for spina bifida was introduced in 2003 by the Polish pediatric surgeon Janusz Bohosiewicz in [[Katowice]]. Through the end of 2011, more than 40 fetuses with spina bifida were operated at this center.<ref>J. Bohosiewicz, T. Koszutski u. a.: Fetal repair of myelomeningocele in human fetuses. Experience related with 33 cases. In: Archives of Perinatal Medicine. Band 17, Nummer 2, 2011, S. 81–84.</ref>

===Endoscopic fetal surgery===
In contrast to the open fetal operative approach performed in the MOMS trial, a [[minimally invasive surgery|minimally-invasive fetoscopic approach]] has been developed by the German pediatrician Thomas Kohl of the German Center for Fetal Surgery & Minimally-Invasive Therapy at the [[University of Giessen]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgm.de/ugm_2/deu/ugm_dzf/16799.html |title=Universitätsklinikum Giessen und Marburg - Offener Rücken/ Spina bifida aperta |publisher=Ukgm.de |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref>

This approach under general materno-fetal anesthesia uses three [[trocars]] (small tubes) with an external diameter of 5 mm that are directly placed through the maternal abdominal wall into the uterine cavity under ultrasound guidance. Following intrauterine access, part of the amniotic fluid is removed and the uterus is insufflated with [[carbon dioxide]] (this technique provides superior visualization of fetoscopic spina bifida closure, is called PACI (partial amniotic fluid insufflation), and has been safe for mothers and fetuses alike in over 70 procedures on human fetuses). After fetal posturing, the neural cord is freed from pathological adhesions and covered with patch material. Watertight closure is demonstrated by intraoperative bulging of the patch. Accordingly, reversal of hindbrain herniation can be documented within days after most procedures.

The observations in mothers and their fetuses that were operated over the past two and a half years by the matured minimally-invasive approach showed the following results: Compared to the open fetal surgery technique, fetoscopic repair of myelomeningocele results in far less surgical trauma to the mother, as large incisions of her abdomen and uterus are not required. In contrast, the initial punctures have a diameter of 1.2 mm only. As a result, thinning of the uterine wall or [[dehisscence]] which have been among the most worriesome and critizised complications after the open operative approach do not occur following minimally-invasive fetoscopic closure of spina bifida aperta. The risks of maternal [[chorioamniotis]] or fetal death as a result of the fetoscopic procedure run below 5%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verbeek|first=R|title=Does fetal endoscopic closure of the myelomeningocele prevent loss of neurologic function in spina bifida aperta?|journal=Cerebrospinal Fluid Research|date=15|year=2010|month=December|volume=7|issue=1|pages=S18–S18|doi=10.1186/1743-8454-7-S1-S18|url=http://www.fluidsbarrierscns.com/content/7/S1/S18|author-separator=,|author2=Heep A|author3=Maurits N|display-authors=2|last4=Cremer|first4=Reinhold|last5=Brouwer|first5=Oebele|last6=Van Der Hoeven|first6=Johannes|last7=Sival|first7=Deborah}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Farmer|first=DL|coauthors=Cornelia S. von Koch, MD, PhD; Warwick J.

In a cohort of 20 infants that underwent fetoscopic surgery on the lesion between July 2010 and December 2011 and were studied during the first six months of life, reversal of hindbrain herniation was observed in 18 (90%) and shunt insertion was required in only eight (40%). Normal to near normal leg function was observed in about two thirds of the infants. An abnormal foot position at birth was observed in only two. The fetuses that were operated at a mean of 24 weeks of gestation were born at a mean gestational age at delivery of about 33 weeks of gestation.<ref>T. Kohl, A.

In 2012, these encouraging results of the fetoscopic approach were presented at various national and international meetings, among them at the 1st European Symposium “Fetal Surgery for Spina bifida“ in April 2012 in [[Giessen]], at the 15th Congress of the [[German Society for Prenatal Medicine and Obstetrics]] in May 2012 in Bonn,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzft.de/?page_id=1420 |title=DZFT beim Kongress DGPGM &#124; DZFT |publisher=Dzft.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref> at the World Congress of the Fetal Medicine Foundation in June 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fetalmedicine.com/fmf/courses-congress/conferences/ |title=The Fetal Medicine Foundation / FMF World Congress |publisher=Fetalmedicine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref> and at the World Congress of the [[International Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology]] (ISUOG) in [[Copenhagen]] in September 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isuog.org/WorldCongress/2012/ |title=World Congress 2012 &#124; World Congress |publisher=ISUOG |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref> and published in abstract form.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Degenhardt J, Schürg R, Kawecki A, Pawlik M, Enzensberger C, Stressig R, Tchatcheva K, Axt-Fliedner R, Kohl T.

In contrast to the low maternal and fetal complication rates that can be achieved by the current fetoscopic approach, its clinical introduction was affected by technical difficulties and a number of adverse fetal outcomes: Three of the first 19 procedures could not be completed, three fetuses died, and the mean gestational age at delivery was 29 weeks of gestation. As a result, the approach was heavily critizised by the independent authors of a controlled study about this cohort and deemed unethical by others.<ref>R. J. Verbeek, A.

In conclusion, both the open and minimally-invasive fetoscopic fetal surgical procedures offer the chance to improve the postnatal prognosis and quality of life of patients affected by spina bifida.{{cn|date=November 2012}} Fetuses that benefit the most seem those with higher lesions, normally appearing leg movements and foot position, and only a mild dilation of the lateral ventricles despite signs of hindbrain herniation. Vice versa, it seems unlikely that leg, bladder or bowel functions that were lost prior to the procedure can be regained by either approach.{{cn|date=November 2012}} Furthermore, fetuses that already exhibit a moderate degree of hydrocephalus at the time of fetal surgery will require postnatal cerebrospinal fluid shunting anyway.{{cn|date=November 2012}} Further studies are required in order to assess the value of fetal surgery on postnatal bladder-, bowel- and sexual function.{{cn|date=November 2012}}

As in patients who undergo standard postnatal spina bifida closure, deterioration of neurogical function from tethered cord, surgical re-interventions, complications of hydrocephalus and Chiari II-treatment must be expected in some patients after open and minimally-invasive fetal surgery, regardless of the quality of their neurological status in the first years of life.
