[[Medical emergencies]] in areas of [[wilderness]] present particular challenges that can requires specialised responses.
 
==Mass casualty incidents==
These are incidents which produce an elevated number of injuries, such as [[blizzards]], [[earthquake]], [[avalanche]], [[landslide]], [[floods]] and [[forest fire]]. [[Triage]] is a concern as well as location of victims who may be in dense foliage, rocky and remote locations or covered in mud, snow and debris. [[Helicopters]] are used to access remote locations during [[natural disasters]]. In other instances, mass casualties have resulted when parties of climbers or explorers have suffered adverse consequences of human error, with or without complications from inclement [[weather]].<ref>http://www.thecityedition.com/2012/First_Aid.html#mass</ref>

==Response==
===Extrication and evacuation===
{{Main|Wilderness emergency response}}
Transporting an injured person out of the wilderness on a stretcher can be a difficult exercise requiring considerable manpower.<ref name="Wilkerson">{{cite web |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y1HG491iAFsC&pg=PA25|title=Medicine for mountaineering & other wilderness activities |first=James |last=Wilkerson|quote=work=books.google.co.uk |year=2001|ISBN=978-0-89886-799-2|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dn8D3CL5MQYC&pg=PA88|title=Keller's Outdoor Survival Guide: How to Prevail When Lost, Stranded, or Injured in the Wilderness |first=William|last=Keller|work=books.google.co.uk |year=2001|ISBN=978-1-57223-266-2|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref> It is advised that at least one person stay with an injured party and that no one attempt to seek help by travelling alone over inhospitable terrain.<ref name="Wilkerson" />

===First aid===
Wilderness First Aid (WFA) is the specific discipline of [[First aid]] which relates to care in remote areas, where [[emergency medical services]] will be difficult to obtain or will take a long time to arrive.

Locating the victim precedes assessment and intervention and in the case of wilderness response is often a difficult matter. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Specialists in [[white water rescue]], [[mountain rescue]], [[mine disaster response]] and other specialties are often employed. In some cases, [[emergency extrication procedures]] at incidents such as [[automobile accidents]] are required before assessment is possible. Once the location of the victim has been determined, a trained responder has been dispatched and successfully reached the victim can the ordinary [[first aid]] process begin.
Assessment is then enabled and it follows carefully specified protocols which have been refined through a long process of evaluation.

==== Specific conditions ====

*'''Exposure''', sometimes called ''[[hypothermia]]'', is a normal hazard of temperate wilderness.  It occurs when a person's core body temperature falls below 33.7C (92.6F). If a person is wet, in a mild wind, it can occur in less than an hour at temperatures as high as 15°C (59°F).

*'''Heat syncope: heat exhaustion or sunstroke''' Both maladies tend to occur during heavy exercise in high humidity, or with inadequate water. Some chronically ill persons enter this state normally.

*'''Cramps''' There are two basic causes of cramping. One is inadequate oxygenation of muscle, and the other is lack of water or salt.  Cramps from poor oxygenation can be improved by rapid deep breathing, and stretching the muscle. Cramps from lack of salt and water can be treated by stretching the muscle, drinking water and eating salt. Cramps occur when lactic acid builds up because of normal anaerobic muscle metabolism. When the muscle burns sugar without enough oxygen, it makes lactic acid. The lactic acid finally becomes concentrated enough to trigger the contraction of the muscle.  When the muscle lacks salt, the nerves firing the muscle are unable to recharge properly, causing a similar effect.

*'''Insect and animal bites'''{{main|bite (medicine)|bites}}

*[[Anaphylactic shock]]. Insect bites as well as exposure to [[allergen]]s can trigger [[anaphylaxis]] in some people. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening medical emergency because of rapid constriction of the airway, often within minutes of onset.

*[[Altitude sickness]] can begin in susceptible people as low as 8,000&nbsp;ft. The early symptoms are drowsiness, feeling unwell, and weakness, especially during exercise.<ref name=MedicalProblems>{{cite journal |author=Cymerman, A; Rock, PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments. A Handbook for Medical Officers |publisher=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |volume=USARIEM-TN94-2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7976 |accessdate=2009-03-05}}</ref> Acute mountain sickness can progress to [[high altitude pulmonary edema]] ([[HAPE]]) or [[high altitude cerebral edema]] ([[HACE]]).<ref name=MedicalProblems/>

*'''Wounds''' The care of significant [[wound]]s in the wilderness presents a great challenge. Lack of access to sterile supplies and hospital care renders useless many aspects of routine wound care. The care of wounds can be broken down into '''acute''' care (immediate) and '''chronic''' (long term – day to day care).

====Certification====
Wilderness First Aid is a relatively new field compared to regular or 'urban' first aid. For this reason, there are a number of boards and societies which have been formed in recent years to attempt to establish normalized standards for wilderness first aid certification and [[wilderness medicine]] in general. Currently, there are no "National Standards" for wilderness medicine, however one of the most popularly followed curricula is the "National Practice Guidelines for Wilderness Emergency Care" published by the Wilderness Medical Society.<ref>www.wms.org</ref>

The American Red Cross Wilderness & Remote First Aid (r.2010) certification is valid for 2 years.<ref>[http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.d229a5f06620c6052b1ecfbf43181aa0/?vgnextoid=fd7c0ffc9331d210VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD&vgnextchannel=aea70c45f663b110VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD#Wilderness] redcross.org</ref>

In Canada the first WFA course were taught in the mid 1980's and the first organization (now defunct 1986 to 1998) to adopt standards was the Wilderness First Aid and Safety Association of BC{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.<ref>[http://www.sja.ca/Ottawa/Training/AtHome/Pages/WildernessFirstAid.aspx] St. John Ambulance provides a Wilderness First Aid course</ref>

The Boy Scouts of America is now also requiring a WFA certification for anybody who goes on a High-Adventure trek.<ref>[http://boyscouts-ncac.org/openrosters/ViewOrgPageLink.asp?LinkKey=17109&orgkey=1988 Boy Scouts of America, NCAC Council]</ref>

====In US Scouting====
"[[Philmont Scout Ranch|Philmont]] requires that a least one person, preferably two, (either an advisor or a youth participant) in each crew be currently certified in  Wilderness First Aid or the equivalent* and CPR from the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, Emergency Care and Safety Institute (ECSI),  or American Safety & Health Institute (ASHI).  The preferred course is the American Red Cross, Wilderness First Aid, which is a sixteen-hour course designed to help in situations when help is not readily available.  Several hours may be required for high adventure staff to reach a remote backcountry location after a message is delivered to the nearest staffed camp.  First aid and CPR training will result in proper and prompt attention being given to injuries and/or illnesses.  You must present current certification cards upon check in to verify this requirement.”

==First responders==

A [[Wilderness First Responder]] certification is both a higher certification than a Wilderness First Aid certification, and may also be used to upgrade an [[Emergency Medical Technician]] to a [[Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician]].<ref>http://www.nols.edu/wmi/courses/course_matrix.shtml</ref>  [[Outdoor Emergency Care]] is a Ski Patroller certification, but it doesn't fully meet the requirements for a WFR certification.<ref>http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(12)00099-3/pdf</ref>

==Golden hour==
In [[emergency medicine]], some advocates assert that there is a  '''golden hour''' which refers to a time period lasting from a few minutes to several hours following [[Physical trauma|trauma]]tic injury being sustained by a casualty, during which there is the highest likelihood that prompt medical treatment will prevent death.<ref>{{cite book |author=American College of Surgeons |title=Atls, Advanced Trauma Life Support Program for Doctors |publisher=Amer College of Surgeons |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=1-880696-31-6 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (6) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> While most medical professionals agree that delays in definitive care are undesirable, recent peer reviewed literature casts doubt on the validity of the 'golden hour' as it appears to lack a scientific basis. Dr. Bryan Bledsoe, an outspoken critic of the ''golden hour'' and other EMS "myths" like [[critical incident stress management]], has indicated that the peer reviewed medical literature does not demonstrate any "magical time" for saving critical patients.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bledsoe | first = Bryan E | title = The Golden Hour: Fact or Fiction | journal = Emergency Medical Services | volume = 6 | issue = 31 | pages = 105 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12078402}}</ref>

==Training and certification organizations==
