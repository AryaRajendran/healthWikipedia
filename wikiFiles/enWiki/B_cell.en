'''B cells''' belong to a group of [[white blood cell]]s known as [[lymphocyte]]s, making them a vital part of the [[immune system]] -- specifically the [[humoral immunity]] branch of the [[adaptive immune system]]. B cells can be distinguished from other lymphocytes, such as [[T cell]]s and [[natural killer cell]]s (NK cells), by the presence of a [[protein]] on the B cell's [[Cell membrane|outer surface]] known as a [[B cell receptor]] '''(BCR)'''. This specialized [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor protein]] allows a B cell to bind to a '''specific''' [[antigen]].

The principal functions of B cells are to make [[antibody|antibodies]] against [[antigen]]s, to perform the role of [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs), and to develop into memory B cells after activation by antigen interaction. Recently, a new, suppressive function of B cells has been discovered.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-074934 |title=Immune Regulatory Function of B Cells |year=2012 |last1=Mauri |first1=Claudia |last2=Bosma |first2=Anneleen |journal=Annual Review of Immunology |volume=30 |pages=221–41 |pmid=22224776}}</ref> 

The abbreviation "B", in B cell, comes from the [[bursa of Fabricius]] in birds, where they mature.  In mammals, immature B cells are formed in the [[bone marrow]], which is used as a [[backronym]] for the cells' name.<ref>Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts k, Walter P (2002) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=mboc4&part=A4422 Molecular Biology of the Cell]. Garland Science: New York, NY pg 1367.</ref>

== Development of B cells ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Antibody]] -->
Immature B cells are produced in the [[bone marrow]] of most mammals.  [[Rabbit]]s are an exception; their B cells develop in the appendix-sacculus rotundus.  After reaching the IgM+ immature stage in the bone marrow, these immature B cells migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues (such as the [[spleen]], [[lymph nodes]], [[Peyer's patches]], etc.) where they are called transitional B cells, and some of these cells differentiate into mature B lymphocytes.<ref name="pmid14962193">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0108.x |title= Alternative routes to maturity: Branch points and pathways for generating follicular and marginal zone B cells |year= 2004 |last1= Allman |first1= David |last2= Srivastava |first2= Bhaskar |last3= Lindsley |first3= R. Coleman |journal= Immunological Reviews |volume= 197 |pages= 147–60 |pmid= 14962193}}</ref>

B cell development occurs through several stages, each stage representing a change in the genome content at the antibody [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]. An antibody is composed of two identical light (L) and two identical heavy (H) chains, and the genes specifying them are found in the 'V' (Variable) region and the 'C' (Constant) region. In the heavy-chain 'V' region there are three segments; V, D and J, which recombine randomly, in a process called [[VDJ recombination]], to produce a unique variable domain in the [[immunoglobulin]] of each individual B cell. Similar rearrangements occur for light-chain 'V' region except there are only two segments involved; V and J.  The list below describes the process of immunoglobulin formation at the different stages of B cell development.

When the B cell fails in any step of the maturation process, it will die by a mechanism called [[apoptosis]], here called [[clonal deletion]].<ref>Parham, P. (2005).  ''The Immune System,'' Garland Science Publishing, New York, NY.{{pn|date=August 2012}}</ref> B cells are continuously produced in the bone marrow. When the  [[B cell receptor]], on the surface of the cell matches the detected [[antigens]] present in the body, the B cell proliferates and secretes a free form of those receptors (antibodies) with identical binding sites as the ones on the original cell surface. After activation, the cell proliferates and B memory cells would form to recognise the same antigen. This information would then be used as a part of the adaptive immune system for a more efficient and more powerful immune response for future encounters with that antigen.

B cell membrane receptors evolve and change throughout the B cell life span.<ref name="urlHyperactive_Blymphocytes_lifespan_receptors">{{cite web |url=http://www.healthvalue.net/Hyperactive_Blymphocytes_lifespan_receptors.html |title=Hyperactive_Blymphocytes_lifespan_receptors |work= |accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> The proteins [[TACI]], [[TNFRSF17|BCMA]] and [[BAFF-R]] ([[B cell activating factor]] receptor) are present on both immature B cells and mature B cells.

[[CD20]] is expressed on all stages of B cell development except the first and last; it is present from pre-B cells through memory cells, but not on either pre-pro-B cells or plasma cells.<ref name=Bona>{{cite book

==Immune tolerance==

Like their fellow lymphocytes, the T cells, immature B cells are tested for auto-reactivity by the immune system before leaving the bone marrow. In the bone marrow (the central lymphoid organ), central tolerance is produced. The immature B cells whose [[B cell receptor]]s (BCRs) bind too strongly to self antigens will not be allowed to mature. If B cells are found to be highly reactive to self, three mechanisms can occur.

*Clonal deletion: the removal, usually by apoptosis, of B cells of a particular self antigen specificity.
*Receptor editing: the BCRs of self reactive B cells are given an opportunity to rearrange their conformation. This process occurs via the continued expression of the [[Recombination activating gene]] (RAG). Through the help of RAG, receptor editing involves light chain gene rearrangement of the B cell receptor. If receptor editing fails to produce a BCR that is less autoreactive, apoptosis will occur. Note that defects in the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes are implicated in [[Severe Combined Immunodeficiency]] (SCID). The inability to recombine and generate new receptors lead to failure of maturity for both B cells and T cells.

*Anergy: B cells enter a state of permanent unresponsiveness when they bind with weakly cross-linking self antigens that are small and soluble.

==Functions==
The human body makes millions of different types of B cells each day that circulate in the [[blood]] and [[lymphatic system]] performing the role of immune surveillance. They do not produce [[antibodies]] until they become fully activated.  Each B cell has a unique receptor [[protein]] (referred to as the [[B cell receptor]] (BCR)) on its surface that will bind to one particular [[antigen]].  The BCR is a membrane-bound [[immunoglobulin]], and it is this [[molecule]] that allows the distinction of B cells from other types of [[lymphocyte]], as well as being the main [[protein]] involved in B cell activation. Once a B cell encounters its cognate antigen and receives an additional signal from a [[T helper cell]], it can further differentiate into one of the two types of B cells listed below ([[plasma B cell]]s and [[memory B cell]]s). The B cell may either become one of these [[Cell (biology)|cell]] types directly or it may undergo an intermediate differentiation step, the [[germinal center]] reaction, where the B cell will [[somatic hypermutation|hypermutate]] the variable region of its [[immunoglobulin]] [[gene]] ("somatic hypermutation") and possibly undergo [[class switching]]. Other functions for B cells include antigen presentation, cytokine production and lymphoid tissue organization.

===Clonality===
B cells exist as [[clone (cell biology)|clones]]. All B cells derive from a particular cell, and thus, the antibodies their differentiated progenies (see below) produce can recognize and/or bind the same specific surface components composed of biological macromolecules ([[epitope]]) of a given antigen. Such clonality has important consequences, as immunogenic memory relies on it. The great diversity in immune response comes about because there are up to 10<sup>9</sup> clones with specificities for recognizing different antigens. A single B cell or a clone of cells with shared specificity, upon encountering its specific antigen, divides to produce many B cells. Most of such B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies into blood that bind the same epitope that elicited proliferation in the first place. A small minority survives as ''memory cells'' that can recognize only the same epitope. However, with each cycle, the number of surviving memory cells '''increases'''. The increase is accompanied by ''affinity maturation'' which induces the survival of B cells that bind to the particular antigen with high affinity. This subsequent amplification with improved specificity of immune response is known as ''secondary immune response''. B cells that have not been activated by antigen are known as ''naive lymphocytes''; those that have met their antigen, become activated, and have differentiated further into fully functional lymphocytes are known as ''effector B lymphocytes''.

===B cell types===
[[Image:Plasmacell.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A suspected plasma cell. Plasma cells are normally detected in tissue rather than circulation.]]
*'''[[Plasma B cell]]s''' (also known as ''plasma cells'', ''plasmocytes'', and ''effector B cells'') are large B cells that have been exposed to antigen and produce and secrete large amounts of [[antibody|antibodies]], which assist in the destruction of [[microbe]]s by binding to them and making them easier targets for [[phagocyte]]s and activation of the [[complement system]]. They are sometimes referred to as ''antibody factories.'' An [[electron micrograph]] of these cells reveals large amounts of [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]], responsible for synthesizing the antibody, in the cell's [[cytoplasm]]. These are short lived cells and undergo [[apoptosis]] when the inciting agent that induced immune response is eliminated. This occurs because of cessation of continuous exposure to various [[colony-stimulating factors]] which is required for survival.

*'''[[Memory B cell]]s''' are formed from activated B cells that are specific to the antigen encountered during the primary immune response.  These cells are able to live for a long time, and can respond quickly following a second exposure to the same antigen.

*'''[[B-1 cell]]s''' express IgM in greater quantities than IgG and their receptors show polyspecificity, meaning that they have low affinities for many different antigens. Polyspecific immunoglobulins often have a preference for other immunoglobulins, self antigens and common bacterial polysaccharides.  B-1 cells are present in low numbers in the lymph nodes and spleen and are instead found predominantly in the peritoneal and pleural cavities.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.it.2006.07.005 |title=New perspectives in B-1 B cell development and function |year=2006 |last1=Montecino-Rodriguez |first1=Encarnacion |last2=Dorshkind |first2=Kenneth |journal=Trends in Immunology |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=428–33 |pmid=16861037}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.coi.2007.02.012 |title=Unraveling B-1 progenitors |year=2007 |last1=Tung |first1=James W |last2=Herzenberg |first2=Leonore A |journal=Current Opinion in Immunology |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=150–5 |pmid=17303402}}</ref>

==Recognition of antigen by B cells==
[[Image:B cell activation.png|thumb|300px|Mechanism of action.]]
[[Image:T-dependent B cell activation.png|thumb|300px|T cell-dependent B cell activation, showing a TH2-cell (left), B cell (right), and several interaction molecules]]
A critical difference between B cells and [[T cells]] is how each lymphocyte recognizes its [[antigen]]. B cells recognize their cognate antigen in its native form. They recognize free (soluble) antigen in the blood or lymph using their BCR or membrane bound-immunoglobulin.  In contrast, T cells recognize their cognate antigen in a processed form, as a [[peptide]] fragment presented by an [[antigen presenting cell]]'s [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] molecule to the [[T cell receptor]].

==Activation of B cells==<!-- This section is linked from [[Antibody]] -->
B cell recognition of antigen is not the only element necessary for B cell activation (a combination of clonal [[cell growth|proliferation]] and terminal [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] into [[plasma cell]]s).
B cells that have not been exposed to antigen, also known as ''naïve B cells'', can be activated in a T cell-dependent or -independent manner.

===T cell-dependent activation===
Once a [[pathogen]] is ingested by an [[antigen-presenting cell]] such as a [[macrophage]] or [[dendritic cell]], the pathogen's proteins are then digested to peptides and attached to a [[major histocompatibility complex|class II MHC]] protein. This complex is then moved to the outside of the cell membrane. The macrophage is now activated to deliver multiple signals to a specific [[T cell]] that recognizes the peptide presented. The T cell is then stimulated to produce [[autocrine signalling|autocrines]], resulting in the proliferation and differentiation to effector and memory T cells. Helper T cells (i.e. CD4+ T cells) then activate specific B cells through a phenomenon known as an [[Immunological synapse]]. Activated B cells subsequently produce antibodies which assist in inhibiting pathogens until [[phagocytes]] (i.e. macrophages, neutrophils) or the [[complement system]] for example clears the host of the pathogen(s).

Most antigens are T-dependent, meaning T cell help is required for maximal antibody production. With a T-dependent antigen, the first signal comes from antigen cross linking the B cell receptor (BCR) and the second signal comes from [[co-stimulation]] provided by a [[T cell]]. T dependent antigens contain proteins that are presented on B cell [[Class II MHC]] to a special subtype of T cell called a [[Th2]] cell. When a B cell processes and presents the ''same'' antigen to the ''primed T<sub>h</sub>'' cell, the T cell secretes [[cytokine]]s that activate the B cell. These cytokines trigger B cell proliferation and differentiation into [[plasma cells]]. Isotype switching to [[IgG]], [[IgA]], and [[IgE]] and memory cell generation occur in response to T-dependent antigens. This isotype switching is known as Class Switch Recombination (CSR). Once this switch has occurred, that particular B cell will usually no longer make the earlier isotypes, [[IgM]] or [[IgD]].

===T cell-independent activation===
Many antigens are T cell-independent in that they can deliver both of the signals to the B cell. [[mouse|Mice]] without a [[thymus]] (nude or [[athymic]] mice that do not produce any T cells) can respond to T independent antigens. Many bacteria have repeating carbohydrate [[epitopes]] that stimulate B cells, by cross-linking the IgM antigen receptors in the B cell, responding with IgM synthesis in the absence of T cell help. [[Conjugate vaccine]]s are made to provide a stronger immune response against these foreign molecules. There are two types of T cell independent activation; ''Type 1 T cell-independent'' ([[polyclonal antibodies|polyclonal]]) activation, and ''type 2 T cell-independent'' activation (in which macrophages present several of the same antigen in a way that causes cross-linking of antibodies on the surface of B cells).

T cell independent activation type 1 is when a B cell binds to an antigen and receives secondary activation by toll-like receptors; type 2 is when the antigen is a molecule with multiple repeating subunits which can simultaneously cross link enough B cell receptors to fully activate the B cell.

In 2011, it was discovered that immortalized rhesus monkey B cells may be activated by the binding of monoamine ligands to [[TAAR1]], a recently discovered [[G protein-coupled receptor|GPCR]]. They found that [[methamphetamine]], a potent TAAR1 [[agonist]], signals [[protein kinase A|PKA]] and [[protein kinase C|PKC]] activation following [[ligand]] binding to TAAR1.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11481-011-9321-4 |title=Trace Amine Associated Receptor 1 Signaling in Activated Lymphocytes |year=2011 |last1=Panas |first1=Michael W. |last2=Xie |first2=Zhihua |last3=Panas |first3=Helen N. |last4=Hoener |first4=Marius C. |last5=Vallender |first5=Eric J. |last6=Miller |first6=Gregory M. |journal=Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology |pmid=22038157}}</ref> Although it is largely recognized as an important regulator of [[monoaminergic]] systems, TAAR1 has only recently been characterized as being important for T cell-independent lymphocyte activation.

==The ancestral roots of B cells==

In an October 2006 issue of [[Nature (journal)|Nature Immunology]], certain B cells of basal [[vertebrates]] (like [[fish]] and [[amphibian]]s) were shown to be capable of [[phagocytosis]], a function usually associated with cells of the [[innate immune system]].  The authors postulate that these phagocytic B cells represent the ancestral history shared between [[macrophages]] and [[lymphocytes]]. B cells may have evolved from macrophage-like cells during the formation of the [[adaptive immune system]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ni1389 |title=B lymphocytes from early vertebrates have potent phagocytic and microbicidal abilities |year=2006 |last1=Li |first1=Jun |last2=Barreda |first2=Daniel R |last3=Zhang |first3=Yong-An |last4=Boshra |first4=Hani |last5=Gelman |first5=Andrew E |last6=Lapatra |first6=Scott |last7=Tort |first7=Lluis |last8=Sunyer |first8=J Oriol |journal=Nature Immunology |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=1116–24 |pmid=16980980}}</ref>

B cells in humans (and other vertebrates) are nevertheless able to endocytose antibody-fixed pathogens, and it is through this route that MHC Class II presentation by B cells is possible, allowing Th2 help and stimulation of B cell proliferation. This is purely for the benefit of MHC Class II presentation, not as a significant method of reducing the pathogen load.

==Origin of the term==
The abbreviation "B" in B cell originally came from [[bursa of Fabricius|'''B'''ursa of Fabricius]], an organ in birds in which avian B [[cell (biology)|cells]] mature.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2007/MB_cgi?mode=&term=Bursa+of+Fabricius&field=entry Bursa of Fabricius]</ref>  When it was discovered that in most mammals immature B cells are formed in bone marrow, the word B cell continued to be used, although other blood cells also originate from pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow.  The fact that bone and bursa both start with the letter 'B' is a coincidence.

==B cell-related pathology==
Aberrant antibody production by B cells is implicated in many [[autoimmune diseases]], such as rheumatoid arthritis and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]. B cells are also susceptible to [[Neoplasm|malignant transformation]].
