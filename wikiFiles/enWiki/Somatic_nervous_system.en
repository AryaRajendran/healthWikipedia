The '''somatic nervous system''' ('''SoNS''' Or '''voluntary nervous system''') is the part of the [[peripheral nervous system]] <ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/20694579|somatic nervous system}}</ref> associated with the [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] control of body movements via [[skeletal muscles]]. The SoNS consists of [[efferent nerve]]s responsible for stimulating [[muscle contraction]], including all the non-sensory [[neuron]]s connected with skeletal [[muscle]]s and [[skin]].

==Parts of Somatic Nervous System==
There are forty three segments of nerves in our body and with each segment there is a pair of sensory and motor nerves. In the body, thirty one  segments of nerves are in the spinal cord and twelve are in the brain stem. 

Besides these, thousands of association nerves are also present in the body.

Thus Somatic Nervous System consists of three parts:

i) '''Spinal Nerves:''' They are peripheral nerves that carry sensory information into the spinal cord and motor commands.

ii) '''Cranial Nerves:''' They are the nerve fibers which carry information into and out of the brain stem. They include smell, vision, eye, eye muscles, mouth, vision,. Taste, ear, neck, shoulders and tongue.

iii) '''Association Nerves:''' These nerves integrate sensory input and motor output numbering thousands.

 
==Nerve signal transmission==
The somatic nervous system controls all [[voluntary muscle|voluntary muscular]] systems within the body, with the exception of [[reflex arc]]s.

The basic route of [[nerve signal]]s within the [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] somatic nervous system involves a sequence that begins in the upper [[Cell (biology)|cell bodies]] of [[motor neuron]]s ([[upper motor neuron]]s) within the [[Brodmann area 4|precentral gyrus]] (which approximates the [[primary motor cortex]]).  Stimuli from the precentral gyrus are transmitted from upper motor neurons and down the [[corticospinal tract]], via [[axon]]s to control skeletal (voluntary) muscles.  These stimuli are conveyed from upper motor neurons through the [[Anterior horn of spinal cord|ventral horn]] of the [[spinal cord]], and across [[synapse]]s to be received by the [[sensory receptor]]s of [[alpha motor neurons]] (large [[lower motor neuron]]s) of the [[brainstem]] and [[spinal cord]].

Upper motor neurons release a [[neurotransmitter]], [[acetylcholine]], from their axon terminal knobs, which are received by [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|nicotinic receptors]] of the alpha motor neurons.  In turn, alpha motor neurons relay the [[stimulus (physiology)|s

From there, acetylcholine is released from the axon terminal knobs of alpha motor neurons and received by postsynaptic [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s ([[Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s) of muscles, thereby relaying the stimulus to contract muscle fibers.

==Vertebrate and invertebrate differences==
In [[invertebrates]], depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could either be excitatory or inhibitory.  For [[vertebrate]]s, however, the response of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter (always [[acetylcholine]] (ACh)) can only be excitatory.

==Reflex arcs==
A [[reflex arc]] is a neural circuit that creates a more or less automatic link between a sensory input and a specific motor output.  Reflex circuits vary in complexityâ€”the simplest spinal reflexes are mediated by a three-element chain, beginning with sensory neurons which activate [[interneuron]]s in the spinal cord, which then activate motor neurons.  Some reflex responses, such as withdrawing the hand after touching a hot surface, are protective, but others, such as the [[patellar reflex]] "knee jerk" activated by tapping the patellar tendon, contribute to ordinary behaviour.
