'''Foster Kennedy syndrome''' (also known as '''Gowers-Paton-Kennedy syndrome''', '''Kennedy's phenomenon''' or '''Kennedy's syndrome''') refers to a constellation of findings associated with tumors of the [[frontal lobe]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000104343|Kennedy syndrome}}</ref>

Although "Foster Kennedy syndrome" is equated with "Kennedy syndrome",<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000104168|Foster Kennedy syndrome}}</ref> it should not be confused with [[Kennedy disease]], which is named for W. R. Kennedy.

''Pseudo-Foster Kennedy syndrome'' is defined as one-sided optic atrophy with papilledema in the other eye but with the absence of a mass.<ref name="Bansal">{{cite journal |author=Bansal S, Dabbs T, Long V |title=Pseudo-Foster Kennedy Syndrome due to unilateral optic nerve hypoplasia: a case report |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=2 |issue= |pages=86 |year=2008 |pmid=18348732 |pmc=2278154 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-86 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/2//86|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>

==Presentation==
The syndrome is defined as the following changes: 
* [[optic atrophy]] in the ipsilateral eye
* [[disc edema]] in the contralateral eye
* Central scotoma (loss of vision in the middle of the visual fields) in the ipsilateral eye
* anosmia (loss of smell) ipsilaterally

This syndrome is due to optic nerve compression, olfactory nerve compression, and increased [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP) secondary to a mass (such as [[meningioma]] or [[plasmacytoma]], usually an olfactory groove meningioma).<ref name="OHCM">{{cite book | last=Longmore | first=Murray | coauthors=Ian Wilkinson, Tom Turmezei, Chee Kay Cheung | title=Oxford Handbook of Clinicial Medicine, 7th edition | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2007 | pages=690 | isbn=0-19-856837-1 }}</ref><ref name="patient">{{cite web |url=http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40001224/ |title=Foster Kennedy syndrome |accessdate=2008-08-13 |last=Willacy |first=Hayley}}</ref> There are other symptoms present in some cases such as [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[memory loss]] and [[emotional lability]] (i.e. [[frontal lobe]] signs).<ref name="patient"/>

==History==
The syndrome was first extensively noted by [[Robert Foster Kennedy]] in 1911, a British [[neurologist]], who spent most of his career working in the [[United States of America]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Kennedy F; Retrobulbar neuritis as an exact diagnostic sign of certain tumors and abscesses in the frontal lobe |last=Thorofare |first=NJ |year=1911 |publisher=American Journal of the Medical Sciences}}</ref> However, the first mention of the syndrome came from a [[William Gowers]] in 1893. Schultz-Zehden described the symptoms again in 1905. A later description was written by Wilhelm Uhthoff in 1915.<ref name="whonamedit">{{cite web |url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/1224.html |title=Kennedy's syndrome |accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>

==Treatment and prognosis==
The treatment, and therefore prognosis, varies depending upon the underlying tumour.<ref name="patient"/>
