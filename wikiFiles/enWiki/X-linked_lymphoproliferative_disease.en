'''X-linked lymphoproliferative disease''' (also known as "Duncan's disease"<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|86}} or "Purtilo syndrome"<ref>http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-disease</ref>) is a [[lymphoproliferative disorder]].<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages=808 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Causes==
===XLP1===
There is a mutation on the X-chromosome that has been found to be associated with a T- and NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. The mutation is on the long arm of the chromosome, at position 25, which is denoted as Xq25. At this position, there is a deletion in the ''[[SH2D1A]]'' gene, which codes for an SH2 domain on a signal transducing protein called SLAM-associated protein (SAP). 

The term "SH2" domain stands for src-homology 2 domain, which is a three-dimensional domain structure of about 100 amino acid residues. These domains are present in many signalling proteins because they permit specific, non-covalent bonding to proteins that contain phosphotyrosines. The amino acid residues adjacent to the phosphotyrosine on the target protein are what determine the unique binding specificity.<ref name="item1">{{cite book |author=Abbas, A.K; Lichtman, A.H. |title=Cellular and Molecular Immunology |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |edition=5th}}</ref>
 
The SAP protein is important in the signalling events that activate T- and NK-cells<ref name="titleX-linked Lymphoproliferative Syndrome: Immunodeficiency Disorders: Merck Manual Professional">{{MerckManual|13|164|p||X-linked Lymphoproliferative Syndrome}}</ref> because it functions as an intracellular adapter that transduces T- and NK-cell activation. Normally, the SAP protein is expressed in the cytoplasm of T- and NK-cells, where it binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the surface receptor called signaling lymphocyte activation molecule ([[Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule|SLAM]]). This binding initiates a signal transduction pathway, which results in the modulation of IFN-γ. A deletion in the SH2D1A gene leads to a non-functional SH2 domain on the SAP protein, which means it is unable to bind to the SLAM molecule, leading to a lack of modulation of IFN-γ, causing uncontrolled cell proliferation.

===XLP2===
A second form is associated with ''[[XIAP]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rigaud S, Fondanèche MC, Lambert N, ''et al.'' |title=XIAP deficiency in humans causes an X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7115 |pages=110–4 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17080092 |doi=10.1038/nature05257 |url=}}</ref>

Some sources recommend classifying this condition as "X-linked familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis" instead of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease.<ref name="pmid20489057">{{cite journal |author=Marsh RA, Madden L, Kitchen BJ, ''et al.'' |title=XIAP deficiency: a unique primary immunodeficiency best classified as X-linked familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and not as X-linked lymphoproliferative disease |journal=Blood |volume=116 |issue=7 |pages=1079–82 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20489057 |doi=10.1182/blood-2010-01-256099 |url= |pmc=2938130}}</ref>

==Presentation==
Strangely, in boys with X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder, there is an inability to mount an immune response to the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV),<ref name="Robbins">{{cite book |author=Kumar,Vinay; Cotran, Ramzi S.; Robbins, Stanley L. |title=Robbins Basic Pathology, 7th Edition |publisher=Elsevier |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |pages=418 |isbn=1-4160-2534-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> which often leads to death from bone marrow failure, irreversible hepatitis, and malignant lymphoma. However, the connection between EBV and X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder is yet to be determined.<ref name="item14">{{EMedicine|article|987765|Lymphoproliferative Disorders}}</ref>
