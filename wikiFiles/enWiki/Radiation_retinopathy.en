'''Radiation retinopathy''' is damage to [[retina]] due to exposure to [[ionizing radiation]]. Radiation retinopathy has a delayed onset, typically after months or years of radiation, and is slowly progressive. In general, radiation retinopathy is seen around 18 months after treatment with external-beam radiation and with brachytherapy. The time of onset of radiation retinopathy is between 6 months to 3 years.<ref name=ao />

An exposure to doses of 30-35 [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy) or more is usually required to induce clinical symptoms, however, retinopathy may develop after as little as 15 Gy of external-beam radiation. A reported safe dose is 3000 rads/30 Gray (1000 rads/10 Gray per week in five fractions i.e. 200 rads/2 Gray per session).<ref name=gupta />

==Pathophysiology==
Radiation retinopathy is very similar to other vascular diseases. [[Diabetic retinopathy|Diabetes]] and radiation primarily damage the retinal capillaries. Diabetes results in early loss of [[pericyte|pericytes]] and thickening of the basement membrane. Radiation however, damages the [[endothelial cells]].

==Presentation==
Clinically, affected patients may be asymptomatic or may complain of decreased visual acuity. Ophthalmic examination may reveal signs of retinal vascular disease, including cotton-wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, microaneurysms, perivascular sheathing, capillary telangiectasis, macular edema, and disc edema. Capillary non perfusion, documented by [[fluorescein angiography]], is commonly present, and extensive retinal ischemia can lead to neovascularization of the retina, iris, and disc. Staging of radiation retinopathy has been proposed.<ref name=finger2 />

==Treatment==
The management of radiation retinopathy is similar to that for diabetic retinopathy and includes focal laser therapy to reduce macular edema or panretinal photocoagulation to treat zones of ischemia and neovascularization. [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|Anti-vascular endothelial growth factors]] have been recently used for the treatment of radiation retinopathy.<ref name=finger />  Monitoring of visual acuity in all cases and early referral to the ophthalmologist is warranted.
