The '''Knudson hypothesis''' (aka '''multiple-hit hypothesis''') is the [[hypothesis]] that [[cancer]] is the result of accumulated [[mutation]]s to a cell's [[DNA]]. It was first proposed by [[Carl O. Nordling]] in 1953,<ref name=Nordling_1953>{{cite journal |author=Nordling C |title=A new theory on cancer-inducing mechanism |journal=Br J Cancer |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=68–72 |year=1953 | url=http://www.carlonordling.se/Cancer.html |pmid=13051507 |pmc=2007872 |doi=10.1038/bjc.1953.8}}</ref><ref name=Marte_2006>{{cite web | author=Marte B | title=Milestone 9: (1953) Two-hit hypothesis - It takes (at least) two to tango | work=Nature Milestones Cancer | url=http://www.nature.com/milestones/milecancer/full/milecancer09.html | date=2006-04-01 | accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref> and later formulated by [[Alfred G.

Knudson won the 1998 [[Albert Lasker Medical Research Award]] for this work.

The ''multi-mutation theory on cancer'' was proposed by Nordling in the [[British Journal of Cancer]] in 1953. He noted that in industrialized nations the frequency of cancer seems to increase according to the sixth power of age. This correlation could be explained by assuming that the outbreak of cancer requires the accumulations of six consecutive mutations.

Later, Knudson performed a statistical analysis on cases of [[retinoblastoma]], a tumor of the [[retina]] that occurs both as an inherited disease and sporadically. He noted that inherited retinoblastoma occurs at a younger age than the sporadic disease. In addition, the children with inherited retinoblastoma often developed the tumor in both eyes, suggesting an underlying predisposition.

Knudson suggested that multiple "hits" to DNA were necessary to cause cancer. In the children with inherited retinoblastoma, the first insult was inherited in the DNA, and any second insult would rapidly lead to cancer. In non-inherited retinoblastoma, two "hits" had to take place before a tumor could develop, explaining the age difference.

It was later found that [[carcinogenesis]] (the development of cancer) depended both on the activation of [[proto-oncogene]]s (genes that stimulate cell proliferation) and on the deactivation of [[tumor suppressor gene]]s (genes that keep proliferation in check). A first "hit" in an oncogene would not necessarily lead to cancer, as normally functioning tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) would still keep the cancer in check; only damage to TSGs would lead to unchecked proliferation. On the converse, a damaged TSG (such as the Rb1 gene in retinoblastoma) would not lead to cancer unless there is uncontrolled growth from an activated oncogene.

[[Field cancerisation]] may be an extended form of the Knudson hypothesis. This is the phenomenon of various primary tumours developing in one particular area of the body, suggesting that an earlier "hit" predisposed the whole area for cancer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Announced in 2011, [[chromothripsis]] similarly involves multiple mutations, but asserts that they may all appear at once.  This idea, affecting only 2–3% of cases of cancer, although up to 25% of bone cancers, involves the catastrophic shattering of a chromosome into tens or hundreds of pieces and then being patched back together incorrectly. This shattering, it is presumed, takes place when the chromosomes are compacted during [[mitosis|normal cell division]], but the trigger for the shattering is unknown.  Under this model, cancer arises as the result of a single, isolated event, rather than the slow accumulation of multiple mutations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stephens PJ |title=Massive Genomic Rearrangement Acquired in a Single Catastrophic Event during Cancer Development |journal=Cell |volume=144 |issue=1 |pages=27–40 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21215367 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.055 |laysource=The New York times |laysummary=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/health/11cancer.html?_r=1&ref=health |laydate=10 January 2011 |author-separator=, |author2=Greenman CD |author3=Fu B |display-authors=3 |last4=Yang |first4=Fengtang |last5=Bignell |first5=Graham R. |last6=Mudie |first6=Laura J. |last7=Pleasance |first7=Erin D. |last8=Lau |first8=King Wai |last9=Beare |first9=David |pmc=3065307 }}</ref>
