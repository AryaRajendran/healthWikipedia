'''Separation anxiety disorder (SAD)''' is a [[psychology|psychological]] condition in which an individual experiences excessive [[anxiety]] regarding separation from home or from people to whom the individual has a strong [[attachment theory|emotional attachment]] (e.g. a parent, grandparents, or siblings).

According to the [[American Psychology Association]], separation anxiety disorder is the inappropriate and excessive display of fear and distress when faced with situations of separation from the home or from a specific attachment figure. The anxiety that is expressed is categorized as being atypical of the expected developmental level and age.{{dead link|date=December 2012}}<ref name=Ehrenreich>{{cite journal|last=Ehrenreich|first=J. T|coauthors=Santucci, L. C., Weinrer, C.

SAD may cause significant negative effects within a child's everyday life, as well. These effects can be seen in areas of social and emotional functioning, family life, physical health, and within the academic context.{{dead link|date=December 2012}}<ref name=Ehrenreich /> The duration of this problem must persist for at least four weeks and must present itself before a child is 18 years of age to be diagnosed as SAD, as specified by the DSM-IV.<ref name=Beesdo />

==Prevalence==
Anxiety disorders are the most common type of psychopathology to occur in today's youth, affecting from 5–25% of children world-wide.<ref name=Ehrenreich /> Of these anxiety disorders, SAD accounts for a large proportion of diagnoses. SAD may account for up to 50% of the anxiety disorders as recorded in referrals for mental health treatment.<ref name=Ehrenreich /> SAD is noted as one of the earliest-occurring of all anxiety disorders.<ref name=Beesdo>{{cite journal|last1=Beesdo|first1=Katja|last2=Knappe|first2=Susanne|last3=Pine|first3=Daniel S.|title=Anxiety and Anxiety Disorders in Children and Adolescents: Developmental Issues and Implications for DSM-V|journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America|year=2009|month=September|volume=32|issue=3|pages=483–524|doi=10.1016/j.psc.2009.06.002}}</ref> Adult separation anxiety disorder affects roughly 7% of adults. 

Research suggests that 4.1% of children will experience a clinical level of separation anxiety. Of that 4.1% it is calculated that nearly a third of all cases will persist into adulthood if left untreated.<ref name=Ehrenreich />  Research continues to explore the implications that early dispositions of SAD in childhood may serve as risk factors for the development of mental disorders throughout adolescence and adulthood.<ref name="Lewinsohn">{{cite journal|last1=Lewinsohn|first1=P. M.|last2=Holm-Denoma|first2=J. M.|last3=Small|first3=J. W.|last4=Seely|first4=J. R|title=Separation anxiety disorder in childhood as a risk factor for future mental illness|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|year=2008|volume=47|issue=5|pages=548–555|doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816765e7}}</ref> It is presumed that a much higher percentage of children suffer from a small amount of separation anxiety, and are not actually diagnosed. Multiple studies have found higher rates of SAD in girls than in boys, and that paternal absence may increase the chances of SAD in girls.<ref name="Cronk">{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}{{cite journal|last1=Cronk|first1=N.J.|last2=Slutske|first2=W.S.|last3=Madden|first3=P.A.|last4=Bucholz|first4=K.K.|last5=Heath|first5=A.C.|title=Risk for separation anxiety disorder among girls: paternal absence, socioeconomic disadvantage, and genetic vulnerability|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|year=2004|month=May|volume=113|issue=2|pages=237–247|pmid=15122944}}</ref>

== Classification ==
Separation anxiety disorder should not be confused with separation anxiety, which occurs as "a normal stage of development for healthy, secure babies."<ref name=Greene>{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}{{cite web|last=Greene|first=Alan|title=Separation Anxiety and Object Permanence|url=http://www.drgreene.com/qa/separation-anxiety-and-object-permanence|publisher=Dr. Greene}}</ref> Separation anxiety occurs as babies begin to understand their own [[Sense of self|selfhood]]—or understand that they are a separate person from their primary caregiver. At the same time, the concept of [[object permanence]] emerges—which is when children learn that something still exists when it is not seen or heard. As babies begin to understand that they can be separated from their primary caregiver, they do not understand that their caregiver will return, nor do they have a concept of time.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms may vary in how children exhibit them, in what context, and the severity. Some common symptoms that children with SAD display include:
* Significant distress, worry, and fear at the thought of or event of separation;
* Clinging to the parent, crying, throwing tantrums, and refusing to participate in activities that require separation from the attachment figure.<ref name=Ehrenreich />
* Fear of harm coming to the attachment figure or the self when separated if they are separated
* Difficulties sleeping without the attachment figure present; persistent nightmares <ref name=Altman>{{cite journal|last1=Altman|first1=C|last2=McGoey|first2=K. E.|last3=Sommer|first3=J. L|title=Anxiety in early childhood: what do we know?|journal=Journal of early childhood and infant psychology|year=2009}}</ref>
* Somatic symptoms including complaints of stomachaches, nausea, or headaches, which, may or may not actually be occurring <ref name=Altman/>
* Avoidance, refusal, reluctance and oppositional behaviors in attempt to prevent separation from occurring <ref name=Bogels/>

==Neural correlates==
Preliminary evidence shows that heightened activity of the amygdala is associated with symptoms of separation anxiety disorder. Defects in the ventrolateral and dorsomedial areas of the prefrontal cortex are also correlated to anxiety disorders in children.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blackford|first=Jennifer U.|coauthors=Daniel S. Pine|title=Neural Substrates of Childhood Anxiety Disorders A Review of Neuroimaging Findings|journal=Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America|year=2012|month=November|volume=21|issue=3|pages=501–525|doi=10.1016/j.chc.2012.05.002}}</ref>

==Contributing factors/etiology==
Factors that contribute to the disorder include a combination and interaction of biological, cognitive, genetic, environmental, child temperament and behavioral factors.

Commonly-noted environmental factors include parenting behavior.  Examples of parenting behavior as contributing factors may include:

# Low parental warmth, discouraging [[autonomy]] in child
# Attachment relationships with parents or caregiver — insecure or anxious attachment styles have been shown to produce feelings of vulnerability, fear of being alone, and chronic anxiety
# Locus of control — this phenomena revolves around a child's thoughts and ability to control one's own environment
# Overprotective or intrusive parenting behaviors — this parenting style may discourage a child's independence and further enforce parental dependence <ref name=Ehrenreich />

A child's temperament can also impact the development of SAD. Timid and shy behaviors may be referred to as "behaviorally inhibited temperaments" in which the child may experience anxiety when they are not familiar with a particular location or person.<ref name=Altman />

==SAD in the academic setting==
As with other anxiety disorders, children with SAD face more obstacles at school than those without anxiety disorders. Adjustment and relating school functioning have been found to be much more difficult for anxious children.<ref name=Mychailyszyn>{{cite journal|last1=Mychailyszyn|first1=Matthew P.|last2=Mendez |first2=Julia L.|last3=Kendall|first3=Philip C.|title=School Functioning in Youth with and without Anxiety Disorders: Comparisons by Diagnosis and Comorbidity|journal=School Psychology Review|year=2010|volume=39|issue=1|pages=106–121|issn=0279-6015}}</ref> In some severe forms of SAD, children may act disruptively in class or may refuse to attend school altogether. It is estimated that nearly 75% of children with SAD exhibit some form of school refusal behavior.<ref name=Ehrenreich /> 

This is a serious problem because, as children fall further behind in coursework, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to return to school.<ref name=Doobay>{{cite journal|last=Doobay|first=Alissa F.|title=School Refusal Behavior Associated with Separation Anxiety Disorder: A Cognitive-Behavioral Approach to Treatment|journal=Psychology in the Schools|year=2008|month=April|volume=45|issue=4|pages=261–272|issn=0033-3085}}</ref>

Short-term problems resulting from academic refusal include poor academic performance or decline in performance, alienation from peers, and conflict within the family.<ref name=Ehrenreich />

== Criteria for diagnosis ==
Separation anxiety occurs in many infants and young children as they are becoming acclimated with their surroundings. This anxiety is viewed as a normal developmental phase between the months of early infancy until age two.<ref name=Ehrenreich /> Other sources note that a definite diagnosis of SAD should not be presented until after the age of three.<ref name=Altman/> Separation anxiety may be diagnosed as a disorder if the child's anxiety related to separation from the home or attachment figure is deemed excessive; if the level of anxiety surpasses that of the acceptable caliber for the child's developmental level and age; and if the anxiety negatively impacts the child's everyday life.<ref name=Ehrenreich /> 

A very important part of diagnosing SAD involves fully understanding the symptoms as the child exhibits them. A clinician must note how behaviors are displayed, the duration that they have persisted, the context in which they occur, and the severity of the symptoms.<ref name=Altman /> It is also important to understand the possible contributing factors.

==Assessment methods and tools==
Assessment methods include diagnostic interviews, self-report measures from both the parent and child, observation of parent-child interaction, and specialized assessment for preschool-aged children. It is vital to explore and understand various facets of the child's development including social life, feeding and sleep schedules, any medical issues, traumatic events experienced, family history of mental or anxiety health issues. The compilation of aspects of a child's life aids in capturing a multi-dimensional view of the child's life.<ref name=Altman />

===Diagnostic interviews===
Clinicians may utilize interviews as an assessment tool to gauge the symptomatic occurrences to aid in diagnosing SAD. Interviews may be conducted with the child and also with the attachment figure. Interviewing both child and parent separately allows for the clinician to compile different points of view and information.<ref name=Ehrenreich />

Commonly used interviews include:<ref name=Ehrenreich />
* Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for the DSM-IV, Child Parent Versions (ADIS-IV-C/P)
* Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version IV (DISC-IV)
* Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-aged Children-Present and lifetime version (K-SADS-IV)

===Self-report measures===
This form of assessment should not be the sole basis of a SAD diagnosis. It is also important to verify that the child who is reporting on their experiences has the cognitive and communication skills appropriate to accurately comprehend and respond to these measurements.<ref name=Ehrenreich />

===Observation===
As noted by Altman, McGoey & Sommer, it is important to observe the child, "in multiple contexts, on numerous occasions, and in their everyday environments (home, daycare, preschool)".<ref name=Altman/> It is beneficial to view parent and child interactions and behaviors that may contribute to SAD.<ref name=Ehrenreich /> 

Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System and recently the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System II (DPICS II) are methods used when observing parents and children interactions.

===Assessment of preschool-aged children===
At the preschool-aged stage, early identification and intervention is crucial.<ref name=Ehrenreich />  There is much more that needs to be done in regards to creating age-appropriate assessments for younger children. It is important to take into consideration the writing and communication abilities of these younger children.<ref name=Altman/>

A commonly-used assessment tool for preschool-aged children (ages 2–5) is the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA).<ref name=Ehrenreich />  Additional questionnaires and rating scales that are used to assess the younger population include the Achenbach Scales, the Fear Survey Schedule for Infants and Preschoolers, and The Infant–Preschool Scale for Inhibited Behaviors.<ref name=Altman/>

Behavioral observations are also utilized when assessing the younger population. Observations enable the clinician to view some of the behaviors and emotions in specific contexts.<ref name=Altman/>

==Treatment==

===Non-pharmacological===
Non-pharmacological treatments are methods of treatment that do not involve drugs. Non-pharmacological treatments are to be used before using pharmacological treatments.<ref name=Ehrenreich />

====Behavioral therapy====
Behavioral therapies are types of non-pharmacological treatment which are mainly exposure-based techniques. These include techniques such as systematic desensitization, emotive imagery, participant modelling and contingency management. Children are forced to go to school and eventually show decreasing symptoms of SAD.<ref name= Masi/>

====Contingency management====
Contingency management is a form of treatment found to be effective for younger children with SAD. Contingency management revolves around a reward system with verbal or tangible reinforcement. When children undergoing contingency management show signs of independence, they are praised or given a reward. Children in preschool who show symptoms of SAD do not have the communicative ability to express their emotions or the self-control ability to cope with their separation anxiety on their own, so parental involvement is crucial in younger cases of SAD.<ref name=Masi />

====Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)====
Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on helping children with SAD reduce feelings of anxiety through practices of exposure to anxiety-inducing situations and active metacognition to reduce anxious thoughts.<ref name=Ehrenreich />

According to Kendall and colleagues, there are four components which must be taught to a child undergoing CBT:<ref name=Barrett>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Interventions that Work with Children and Adolescents: Prevention and Treatment|year=2003|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0470844533|editor1-last=Barrett|editor1-first=Paula M.|editor2-last=Ollendick|editor2-first=Thomas H.}}</ref>
# Recognizing anxious feelings and behaviors
# Discussing situations that provoke anxious behaviors
# Developing a coping plan with appropriate reactions to situations
# Evaluating effectiveness of the coping plan

The method behind CBT is that faulty cognition is the reason for the anxiety of SAD.<ref name="Barrett" />

A 1998 study of CBT on children nine and younger found 64% of the treated children did not meet the DSM's criteria for SAD. Only 5% of the waitlisted children in the study showed these results.<ref name="Barrett" />

Another study investigated the content of thoughts in anxious children who suffered from separation anxiety as well as from social phobia and/or generalizable anxiety. The results added to knowledge of cognitive behavioral therapy. It is suggested that cognitive therapy for children suffering from separation anxiety (along with social phobia and generalized anxiety) should be aimed at identifying negative cognitions of one's own behavior in the threat of anxiety-evoking situations and to modify these thoughts to promote self-esteem and ability to properly cope with the given situation.<ref name=Bogels>{{cite journal|last=Bogels|first=S. M.|coauthors=Zigterman, D.|title=Dysfunctional cognitions in children with social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder|journal=Journal of abnormal child psychology|year=2000|volume=28|issue=2|pages=205–211}}</ref>

Cognitive procedures are a form of treatment found to be ideal for older children with SAD.<ref name="Masi" /> The theory behind this technique is that the child's dysfunctional thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs are what lead to anxiety and cause anxious behavior.<ref name="Masi" /> Children who are being treated with cognitive procedures are taught to ask themselves if there is "evidence" to support their anxious thoughts and behaviors.<ref name="Masi" /> They are taught "coping thoughts" to use during anxiety-inducing situations and to praise themselves for handling the situation bravely.<ref name="Masi" />

===Pharmacological===
Pharmacological treatment is used in extreme cases of SAD when non-pharmacological treatments fail,<ref name="Masi" /><ref name="Barrett" /> typically for school refusal. However, children with school refusal may have conditions other than SAD. Pharmacological management of SAD includes the use of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s.<ref name="Masi" />

==Prognosis==
Helping children with separation anxiety to identify the circumstances that elicit their anxiety (upcoming separation events) is important. A child's ability to tolerate separations should gradually increase over time when he or she is gradually exposed to the feared events. Encouraging a child with separation anxiety disorder to feel competent and empowered, as well as to discuss feelings associated with anxiety-provoking events promotes recovery.

Children with separation anxiety disorder often respond negatively to perceived anxiety in their caretakers, in that parents and caregivers who also have anxiety disorders may unwittingly confirm a child's unrealistic fears that something terrible may happen if they are separated from each other. Thus, it is critical that parents and caretakers become aware of their own feelings and communicate a sense of safety and confidence about separation.<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Bettina E.|editor-last=Perlstein|editor-first=David|title=Separation Anxiety|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/separation_anxiety/article_em.htm|publisher=WebMD}}</ref>

==Longitudinal effects of SAD==
Several studies aim to understand the long-term mental health consequences of SAD.<ref name=Lewinsohn /> SAD contributed to vulnerability and acted as a strong risk factor for developing mental disorders in people aged 19–30. Specifically disorders including panic disorder and depressive disorders were more likely to occur.<ref name=Lewinsohn /> Other sources also support the increased likelihood of displaying either of the two psychopathologies with previous history of childhood SAD.<ref name=Beesdo />
