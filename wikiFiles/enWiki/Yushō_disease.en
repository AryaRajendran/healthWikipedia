{{nihongo|'''Yushō disease'''|油症|}} (literally ''oil symptoms'') was a mass poisoning by PCBs which occurred in northern [[Kyūshū]], [[Japan]] in 1968.<ref name=NCBI>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11386736&dopt=Abstract Polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo...[Environ Res. 2001&#93; - PubMed Result<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=RARE>{{RareDiseases|8326}}</ref><ref>Shimanosuke Katsuki, ''Preface to Yusho Kenkyu Houkokushu'', Fukuoka Igakkukai Zasshi, 60, 403-407, 1969.</ref> In January 1968, [[rice bran oil]] produced by Kanemi Company in Kyushu started to become contaminated with [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) and [[polychlorinated dibenzofurans]] (PCDFs). The contaminated rice bran oil was then sold to poultry farmers for use as a feed supplement and to consumers for use in cooking.<ref name="jsta"/> In February to March 1968, farmers started reporting that their poultry were dying due to apparent difficulty in breathing; altogether 400,000 birds died.<ref name="jsta"/> About 14,000 people who had consumed the contaminated rice oil were affected in Japan.<ref name="jsta">{{cite web | title=Contamination of rice bran oil with PCB used as the heating medium by leakage through penetration holes at the heating coil tube in deodorization chamber | publisher=''[http://www.sozogaku.com/fkd/en/index.html Hatamura Institute for the Advancement of Technology]'' | url=http://www.sozogaku.com/fkd/en/cfen/CB1056031.html | accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> Common symptoms included [[Human skin|dermal]] and [[Human eye|ocular]] [[lesion]]s, irregular [[menstrual cycle]]s and a lowered [[immune response]].<ref name=NCBI /><ref name=RARE /><ref name=FOX>[http://www.foxriverwatch.com/baby_studies_pcbs_2.html PCB Baby Studies Part 2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Other symptoms included fatigue, headache, cough, and unusual skin sores.<ref name=HEALTH>[http://www.healthgoods.com/Education/Health_Information/General_Health/environmental_diseases.htm Environmental Diseases from A to Z<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Additionally, in children, there were reports of poor cognitive development.<ref name=NCBI /><ref name=FOX /><ref name=HEALTH />

Although a decade had passed, an almost identical case occurred in [[Taiwan]] in 1979.  Again, rice oil had been heated by filaments that leaked.  On this occasion, the condition there was known as '''Yu-cheng disease'''({{zh|w=Yu<sup>2</sup> cheng<sup>4</sup>|p=yóuzhèng|c=油症}}). Similar symptoms and effects of the PCBs and PCDFs were shown, especially in children.<ref name=FOX />

There have been studies undertaken on animals to understand the mechanisms of PCBs and PCDFs and their effects.<ref name=NCBI /> Scientists discovered that low levels of PCB's could kill fish and other wildlife and as such their use in manufacturing was reduced.<ref name=HEALTH />

The most recent incident of dioxin poisoning is the [[2008 Irish pork crisis]] in which Irish pork was recalled worldwide.
