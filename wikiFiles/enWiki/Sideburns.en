'''Sideburns''' or '''sideboards'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/sideboard?view=uk|title=AskOxford|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> are patches of [[facial hair]] grown on the sides of the face, extending from the hairline to below the ears and worn with an unbearded chin. The term ''sideburns'' is a 19th-century [[Corruption (linguistics)|corruption]] of the original ''burnsides'', named after [[American Civil War]] general [[Ambrose Burnside]],<ref name="Gool29">{{cite book|last=Goolrick|first=William K.|title=Rebels Resurgent: Fredericksburg to Chancellorsville|pages=29}}</ref> a man known for his unusual facial hairstyle that connected thick sideburns by way of a [[moustache]], but left the chin [[clean-shaven]].  "Burnsides" became "sideburns" because of their location on the face and for the somewhat incompetent Burnside's tendency to "get things the wrong way 'round".

Sideburns can be worn and grown in combination with other styles of facial hair, such as the [[moustache]] or [[goatee]], but once they extend from ear to ear via the chin they cease to be sideburns and become a [[beard]], [[chinstrap beard]], or [[chin curtain]]. Friendly mutton chops are a variation which adds a connecting mustache to the side burns. <ref>{{cite web|title=Mutton Chops|url=http://beards.net/mutton-chops/|work=Authority Website|publisher=Beards.net|accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref> 

Indigenous men of [[Mexico]], who shaved their heads and wore their sideburns long, as well as [[Colombia]]ns, who wear their sideburns long and typically do not have any other facial hair, are said to be wearing "''balcarrotas''", rarely seen in modern times, but prized in the sixteenth century, as a mark of virile vanity and banned by the colonial authorities in [[New Spain]], occasioning rioting in 1692.<ref>[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/vocabulario-de-mexicanismos-comprobado-con-ejemplos-y-comparado-con-los-de-otros-paises-hispanoamericanos--0/html/03b9b7a8-f6cc-4cca-9e5d-1358d09b2197_4.html#1510 Vocabulario de maxicanismos]</ref>

==History==
In ancient history, [[Alexander the Great]] is depicted with sideburns in [[Alexander Mosaic|a mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]].

Following the eighteenth century, when European men west of Poland were universally clean-shaven, sideburns, like beards, began to grow in popularity during the Napoleonic period, as first among military men (''illustration, left''); the trend eventually made its way to [[Meiji Japan]], in the first wave of Western fashion there. The return of facial hair in Western Europe began as a [[Military uniform|military fashion]], at first inspired by the heroic sideburns sported by [[hussar]] regiments.

Following the fashion in Europe young [[South America]]n [[Criollo people|criollo]]s adopted sideburns. Many of the independence heroes of South America, including [[José de San Martín]], [[Manuel Belgrano]], [[Antonio José de Sucre]], [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], [[José Miguel Carrera]], and [[Antonio Nariño]] had sideburns and are as such depicted on numerous paintings, coins and banknotes.   

Nineteenth century sideburns were often far more extravagant than those seen today, similar to what are now called mutton chops. As with beards, sideburns went quickly out of [[fashion]] in the early twentieth century, and in the First World War in order to secure a seal on a [[gas mask]], men had to be clean-shaven; this did not affect [[mustache]]s.<ref>[http://www.chemical-biological-attack-survival-guide.com/gas-masks.htm Gas Masks]</ref>

In 1936 [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt's]] brief experiment with sideburns, grown on a yachting cruise, provoked only laughter from his wife Eleanor.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30B13FD355B1B7B93CAAB178CD85F428385F9 "President Grows crop of Sideburns: Mrs. Roosevelt Laughs Heartily as He Arrives at Campobello"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' 28 July 1936. Retrieved 9 September 2008.</ref> Sideburns made a comeback in the mid-1950s, when [[James Dean]]'s sideburns identified him as a ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955). Spurred by [[Elvis Presley]], sideburns were sported by "hoods", "greasers", and "rockers" as an emblem of rebellious post-pubescent manliness by young men who scorned to be "[[Ivy League]]".<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0615FE3854177B93CBA91789D85F438585F9 "Sideburns a la Presley Aren't Ivy; Dern of Penn Quits Track Rather Than Alter Appearance"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1957. Retrieved 9 September 2008.</ref> Sideburns gained new connotations in 1960s [[hippie]] subculture: the struggle of a New Jersey youth to wear sideburns to his public high school graduation made a newspaper article in 1967<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50E16F73B5E1B7A93C1A8178DD85F438685F9 "Youth With Sideburns Is Graduated in Jersey"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 13 June 1967. Retrieved 9 September 2008.</ref> and in the late 1960s and early 1970s among youth subcultures such as [[hippie]]s and [[skinhead]]s (although skinheads often favor mutton chops). Sideburns also became a symbol of the gay club scenes of [[San Francisco]] and [[Sydney]], primarily Lambchops. Because of their multifarious history, sideburns may be seen as stuffily [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] and ultra-[[conservative]], a sign of [[Rebellion|rebelliousness]], or merely an artifact of current fashion.
