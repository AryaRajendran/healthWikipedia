'''Neuropathic pain''' is [[pain]] caused by damage or disease that affects the [[somatosensory system]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=12215 |title=www.iasp-pain.org |format= |work= |accessdate=11 December 2010}}</ref> It may be associated with abnormal sensations called [[dysesthesia]], and pain produced by normally non-painful stimuli ([[allodynia]]). Neuropathic pain may have continuous and/or episodic (paroxysmal) components. The latter are likened to an electric shock. Common qualities  include burning or coldness, "pins and needles" sensations, numbness and itching. [[nociceptive pain]], by contrast, is more commonly described as aching.

Up to 7% to 8% of the European population is affected, and in 5% of persons it may be severe.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Torrance N, Smith BH, Bennett MI, Lee AJ |title=The epidemiology of chronic pain of predominantly neuropathic origin.

Neuropathic pain may result from disorders of the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Thus, neuropathic pain may be divided into peripheral neuropathic pain, central neuropathic pain, or mixed (peripheral and central) neuropathic pain.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Cause==
Central neuropathic pain is found in spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and some strokes. Aside from diabetes (see [[diabetic neuropathy]]) and other metabolic conditions, the common causes of painful peripheral neuropathies are [[herpes zoster]] infection, HIV-related neuropathies, nutritional deficiencies, toxins, remote manifestations of malignancies, immune mediated disorders and physical trauma to a nerve trunk.<ref name="pmid2566901">{{cite journal |author=Portenoy RK |title=Painful polyneuropathy |journal=Neurol Clin |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=265–88 |year=1989 |pmid=2566901 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid10386118">{{cite journal |author=Vaillancourt PD, Langevin HM |title=Painful peripheral neuropathies |journal=Med.

==Mechanisms==

===Peripheral===
After a peripheral nerve [[lesion]], aberrant regeneration may occur. Neurons become unusually sensitive and develop spontaneous [[pathological]] activity, abnormal excitability, and heightened sensitivity to chemical, thermal and mechanical stimuli. This phenomenon is called "peripheral [[sensitization]]".

===Central===
The (spinal cord) [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] neurons give rise to the [[spinothalamic tract]] (STT), which constitutes the major ascending nociceptive pathway. As a consequence of ongoing spontaneous activity arising in the periphery, STT neurons develop increased background activity, enlarged receptive fields and increased responses to afferent impulses, including normally innocuous tactile stimuli. This phenomenon is called central sensitization. Central sensitization is an important mechanism of persistent neuropathic pain.

Other mechanisms, however, may take place at the central level after peripheral nerve damage. The loss of afferent signals induces functional changes in dorsal horn neurons. A decrease in the large fiber input decreases activity of interneurons inhibiting nociceptive neurons i.e. loss of afferent inhibition. Hypoactivity of the descending antinociceptive systems or loss of descending inhibition may be another factor. With loss of neuronal input (deafferentation) the STT neurons begin to fire spontaneously, a phenomenon designated "deafferentation hypersensitivity."

[[Neuroglia]] ("glial cells") may play a role in central sensitization. Peripheral nerve injury induces glia to release proinflammatory [[cytokines]] and [[glutamate]]—which, in turn influence neurons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wieseler-Frank J, Maier SF, Watkins LR |title=Central proinflammatory cytokines and pain enhancement |journal=Neuro-Signals |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=166–74 |year=2005 |pmid=16215299 |doi=10.1159/000087655 |url=}}</ref>

===Mechanisms at light-microscopic and submicroscopic levels===
The phenomenon described above are dependent on changes at light-microscopic and submicroscopic levels. Altered expression of ion channels, changes in neurotransmitters and their receptors as well as altered gene expression in response to neural input are at play.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Truini A, Cruccu G |title=Pathophysiological mechanisms of neuropathic pain |journal=Neurol. Sci. |volume=27 Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=S179–82 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16688626 |doi=10.1007/s10072-006-0597-8 |url=}}</ref>

==Treatments==
Neuropathic pain can be very difficult to treat with only some 40-60% of patients achieving partial relief.<ref name="pmid17920770">{{cite journal |author=Dworkin RH, O'Connor AB, Backonja M, ''et al.'' |title=Pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain: evidence-based recommendations |journal=Pain |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=237–51 |year=2007 |pmid=17920770 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2007.08.033}}</ref>

In addition to the work of Dworkin, O'Connor and Backonja et al., cited above, there have been several recent attempts to derive guidelines for pharmacological therapy.<ref name="pmid17038030">{{cite journal |author=Attal N, Cruccu G, Haanpää M, ''et al.'' |title=EFNS guidelines on pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain |journal=Eur.

Determining the best treatment for individual patients remains challenging. Attempts to translate scientific studies into best practices are limited by factors such as differences in reference populations and a lack of head-to-head studies. Furthermore, multi-drug combinations and the needs of special populations, such as children, require more study.

It is common practice in medicine to designate classes of medication according to their most common or familiar use e.g. as "antidepressants" and "anti-epileptic drugs" (AED's). These drugs have alternate uses to treat pain because the human nervous system employs common mechanisms for different functions, for example [[ion channels]] for impulse generation and neurotransmitters for cell-to-cell signaling.

Favored treatments are certain antidepressants e.g. [[tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclics]] and selective [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRI's), [[anticonvulsant]]s, especially [[pregabalin]] (Lyrica) and [[gabapentin]] (Neurontin), and topical [[lidocaine]]. [[Opioid]] analgesics and [[tramadol]] are recognized as useful agents but are not recommended as first line treatments. Many of the pharmacologic treatments for chronic neuropathic pain decrease the sensitivity of [[Nociception|nociceptive]] receptors, or desensitize [[C fibers]] such that they transmit fewer signals.

Some drugs may exert their influence through descending pain modulating pathways. These descending pain modulating pathways originate in the brainstem.

===Antidepressants===
{{Main|Antidepressants}}
The functioning of antidepressants is different in neuropathic pain from that observed in depression. Activation of descending norepinephrinergic and serotonergic pathways to the spinal cord limit pain signals ascending to the brain. Antidepressants relieve neuropathic pain in non-depressed persons.

In animal models of neuropathic pain it has been found that compounds that only block serotonin reuptake do not improve neuropathic pain.<!--

Similarly, compounds that only block [[norepinephrine]] reuptake also do not improve neuropathic pain. Dual [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s such as [[duloxetine]], [[venlafaxine]], and [[milnacipran]], as well as [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s such as [[amitriptyline]], [[nortriptyline]], and [[desipramine]] improve neuropathic pain and are considered first-line medications for this condition.<ref name="mayo"/>

Tricyclic antidepressants may also have effects on sodium channels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tricyclic Overdose (Sodium-Channel Blocker Toxicity)|url=http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ecg-library/basics/tca-overdose/|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref>

===Anticonvulsants===
{{Main|Anticonvulsants}}
[[Pregabalin]] (Lyrica) and [[gabapentin]] (Neurontin) work by blocking specific calcium channels on neurons and are preferred first-line medications for [[diabetic neuropathy]]. The anticonvulsants [[carbamazepine]] (Tegretol) and [[oxcarbazepine]] (Trileptal) are especially effective in [[trigeminal neuralgia]].  The actions of these two drugs are mediated principally through [[sodium channels]].

Lamotrigine may have a special role in treating two conditions for which there are few alternatives, namely post stroke pain and HIV/AIDS-related neuropathy in patients already receiving [[antiretroviral therapy]].<ref>Wiffen PJ, Rees J. Lamotrigine for acute and chronic pain. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2007;(2):CD006044.</ref>

===Opioids===
{{Main|Opioids}}
Opioids, also known as narcotics, are increasingly recognized as important treatment options for chronic pain. They are not considered first line treatments in neuropathic pain but remain the most consistently effective class of drugs for this condition. Opioids must be used only in appropriate individuals and under close medical supervision.

Several opioids, particularly [[methadone]], and [[ketobemidone]] possess NMDA antagonism in addition to their µ-opioid agonist properties. Methadone does so because it is a [[racemic]] mixture; only the l-isomer is a potent µ-opioid agonist. The d-isomer does not have opioid agonist action and acts as an NMDA antagonist; d-methadone is analgesic in experimental models of chronic pain.<ref name="pmid10215686">{{cite journal |author=Davis AM, Inturrisi CE |title=d-Methadone blocks morphine tolerance and N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced hyperalgesia |journal=J. Pharmacol. Exp.

There is little evidence to indicate that one strong opioid is more effective than another. Expert opinion leans toward the use of methadone for neuropathic pain, in part because of its NMDA antagonism.  It is reasonable to base the choice of opioid on other factors.<ref name="pmid14701781">{{cite journal |author=Bruera E, Palmer JL, Bosnjak S, ''et al.'' |title=Methadone versus morphine as a first-line strong opioid for cancer pain: a randomized, double-blind study |journal=J.

===Topical agents===
In some forms of neuropathy, especially [[post-herpetic neuralgia]], the topical application of local anesthetics such as [[lidocaine]], or anti-inflammatory agents such as [[gallium maltolate]] (based on a case study and preclinical research),<ref name="PHN">{{cite journal |last=Bernstein |first=L.R.| title = Successful treatment of refractory postherpetic neuralgia with topical gallium maltolate: case report | journal = Pain Medicine | year = 2012 | volume = 13 | pages = 915–918 | url = http://www.gallixa.com/GAMReferences/BernsteinPainMedicine2012.pdf | doi = 10.1111/j.1526-4637.2012.01404.x | pmid = 22680305 }}</ref> can provide relief. A transdermal patch containing lidocaine is available commercially in some countries.

Repeated topical applications of capsaicin, are followed by a prolonged period of reduced skin sensibility referred to as desensitization, or nociceptor inactivation.   Capsaicin not only depletes [[substance P]] but also results in a reversible degeneration of epidermal nerve fibers.<ref name="pmid10353501">{{cite journal |author=Nolano M, Simone DA, Wendelschafer-Crabb G, Johnson T, Hazen E, Kennedy WR |title=Topical capsaicin in humans: parallel loss of epidermal nerve fibers and pain sensation |journal=Pain |volume=81 |issue=1–2 |pages=135–45 |year=1999 |pmid=10353501| doi = 10.1016/S0304-3959(99)00007-X}}</ref>   Nevertheless, benefits appear modest with standard (low) strength preparations,<ref name="pmid17955091">{{cite journal |author=Finnerup NB, Otto M, Jensen TS, Sindrup SH |title=An Evidence-Based Algorithm for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain |journal=MedGenMed |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=36 |year=2007 |pmid=17955091 |pmc=1994866 |doi=}}</ref> and topical capsaicin can itself induce pain.<ref name="pmid10353501" />

===Cannabinoids===
[[Marijuana]]'s active ingredients are called [[cannabinoids]]. Use of [[Medical Marijuana]] for pain relief has been approved in some locations around the world, including many states in the [[United States]].{{cn|date=December 2012}}

A recent study showed smoked [[medical cannabis|marijuana]] is beneficial in treating symptoms of [[HIV]]-associated peripheral neuropathy.<ref name="hiv">{{cite journal |author=Abrams D, Jay C, Shade S, Vizoso H, Reda H, Press S, Kelly M, Rowbotham M, Petersen K |title=Cannabis in painful HIV-associated sensory neuropathy: a randomized placebo-controlled trial |journal=Neurology |volume=68 |issue=7 |pages=515–21 |year=2007 |pmid=17296917 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000253187.66183.9c}}</ref>
[[Nabilone]] is an artificial cannabinoid that is significantly more potent than delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

===Botulinum toxin type A===
[[Botulinum toxin]] type A (BTX-A) is best known by its trade name, Botox. Local intradermal injection of BTX-A is helpful in chronic focal painful neuropathies. The analgesic effects are not dependent on changes in muscle tone. Benefits persist for at least 14 weeks from the time of administration.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ranoux D, Attal N, Morain F, Bouhassira D |title=Botulinum toxin type A induces direct analgesic effects in chronic neuropathic pain |journal=Annals of neurology |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=274–83 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18546285 |doi=10.1002/ana.21427 |url=}}</ref>

===NMDA antagonism===
The [[NMDA receptor|''N''-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor]]  seems to play a major role in neuropathic pain and in the development of opioid tolerance. [[Dextromethorphan]] is an NMDA antagonist at high doses. Experiments in both animals and humans have established that NMDA [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] such as [[ketamine]] and [[dextromethorphan]] can alleviate neuropathic pain and reverse opioid tolerance.<ref name="pmid9153445">{{cite journal |author=Nelson KA, Park KM, Robinovitz E, Tsigos C, Max MB |title=High-dose oral dextromethorphan versus placebo in painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia |journal=Neurology |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=1212–8 |year=1997 |pmid=9153445 |doi=}}</ref> Unfortunately, only a few NMDA antagonists are clinically available and their use is limited by a very short half life (dextromethorphan), weak activity (memantine) or unacceptable side effects (ketamine).

===Reducing sympathetic nervous stimulation===
In some neuropathic pain syndromes, "crosstalk" occurs between descending sympathetic nerves and ascending sensory nerves. Increases in sympathetic nervous system activity result in an increase of pain; this is known as sympathetically-mediated pain.

Lesioning operations on the sympathetic branch of the [[autonomic nervous system]] are sometimes carried out.

There are methods of treating sympathetically maintained pain in peripheral tissues. This is done topically to a patient having sympathetically maintained pain at a peripheral site where the pain originates.  Wherein the sympathetically maintained pain can be diagnosed by local anesthetic blockade of the appropriate [[sympathetic ganglion]] or [[adrenergic receptor]] blockade via intravenous administration of [[phentolamine]], and rekindled by intradermal injection of [[norepinephrine]].<ref>Campbell; James N., Compositions and methods of treatment of sympathetically maintained pain (1998).</ref>

===Dietary supplements===

A 2007 review of studies found that injected ([[Route of administration#Parenteral by injection or infusion|parenteral]]) administration of [[alpha lipoic acid]] (ALA) was found to reduce the various symptoms of peripheral diabetic neuropathy.<ref name="pmid17272797">{{cite journal |author=Foster TS |title=Efficacy and safety of alpha-lipoic acid supplementation in the treatment of symptomatic diabetic neuropathy |journal=Diabetes Educ |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=111–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17272797 |doi=10.1177/0145721706297450 |quote=ALA appears to improve neuropathic symptoms and deficits when administered via parenteral supplementation over a 3-week period.

===Neuromodulators===
Neuromodulation is a field of science, medicine and bioengineering that encompasses both implantable and non-implantable technologies (electrical and chemical) for treatment purposes.<ref>Krames ES. Neuromodulatory devices are part of our "Tools of the Trade". Pain Med 2006;7:S3-5.</ref>

Implanted devices are expensive and carry the risk of complications.   Available studies have focused on conditions having a different prevalence than neuropathic pain patients in general. More research is needed to define the range of conditions that they might benefit.

====Spinal cord stimulators and implanted spinal pumps====
Spinal cord stimulators, use electrodes placed adjacent to, but outside the spinal cord. The overall complication rate is one-third, most commonly due to lead migration or breakage but advancements in the past decade have driven complication rates much lower. Lack of pain relief occasionally prompts device removal.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Turner JA, Loeser JD, Deyo RA, Sanders SB |title=Spinal cord stimulation for patients with failed back surgery syndrome or complex regional pain syndrome: a systematic review of effectiveness and complications |journal=Pain |volume=108 |issue=1–2 |pages=137–47 |year=2004 |pmid=15109517 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2003.12.016}}</ref>

Infusion pumps deliver medication directly to the fluid filled (subarachnoid) space surrounding the spinal cord. Opioids alone or opioids with adjunctive medication (either a local anesthetic or clonidine) or more recently ziconotide<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lynch SS, Cheng CM, Yee JL |title=Intrathecal ziconotide for refractory chronic pain |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=40 |issue=7–8 |pages=1293–300 |year=2006 |pmid=16849624 |doi=10.1345/aph.1G584}}</ref> are infused.   Complications such as, serious infection (meningitis), urinary retention, hormonal disturbance and intrathecal granuloma formation have been noted with intrathecal infusion.

There are no randomized studies of infusion pumps. For selected patients 50% or greater pain relief is achieved in 38% to 56% at six months but declines with the passage of time.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Turner JA, Sears JM, Loeser JD |title=Programmable intrathecal opioid delivery systems for chronic noncancer pain: a systematic review of effectiveness and complications |journal=Clin J Pain |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=180–95 |year=2007 |pmid=17237668 |doi=10.1097/01.ajp.0000210955.93878.44}}</ref> These results must be viewed skeptically since placebo effects cannot be evaluated.

====Motor cortex stimulation====
Stimulation of the primary motor cortex through electrodes placed within the skull but outside the thick meningeal membrane (dura) has been used to treat pain.   The level of stimulation is below that for motor stimulation. As compared with spinal stimulation, which requires a noticeable tingling (paresthesia) for benefit, the only palpable effect is pain relief.<ref>Brown JA, Pilitsis JG. Motor Cortex Stimulation

====Deep brain stimulation====
The best long-term results with [[deep brain stimulation]] have been reported with targets in the periventricular/periaqueductal [[grey matter]] (79%), or the periventricular/periaqueductal grey matter plus [[thalamus]] and/or internal capsule (87%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bittar RG, Kar-Purkayastha I, Owen SL, ''et al.'' |title=Deep brain stimulation for pain relief: a meta-analysis |journal=J Clin Neurosci |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=515–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15993077 |doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2004.10.005}}</ref>  There is a significant complication rate, which increases over time.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oh MY, Abosch A, Kim SH, Lang AE, Lozano AM |title=Long-term hardware-related complications of deep brain stimulation |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=1268–74; discussion 1274–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12015845| doi = 10.1097/00006123-200206000-00017}}</ref>
