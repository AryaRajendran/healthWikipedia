'''Wyeth''', formerly one of the companies owned by '''American Home Products Corporation''' ('''AHP'''), was a [[pharmaceutical company]]. The company was based in [[Madison, New Jersey|Madison]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States|USA]]. They were known for manufacturing the [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter (OTC) drug]]s [[Robitussin]] and the [[analgesic]] [[Advil]] ([[ibuprofen]]), as well as the prescription drugs [[Premarin]] and [[Effexor]], which both boast over [[United States dollar|US$]]3 billion in sales annually.

On January 23, 2009 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that [[Pfizer]] was in talks to buy Wyeth at a cost of [[United States dollar|US$]]68 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B104B1CE4%2DEB51%2D42C7%2DB2F9%2D75947C58E08A%7D |title=Pfizer in talks to acquire Wyeth in $60 billion deal: WSJ |publisher=MarketWatch |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref> On January 25, Pfizer agreed to the purchase, a deal financed with cash, shares and loans.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pettypiece |first=Shannon |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aBKORs4C1t4g&refer=home |title=Pfizer’s $68 Billion Wyeth Deal Eases Lipitor Loss |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref> The deal was completed on October 15, 2009.<ref name=PfizerWyeth>{{cite web

==History==

===1860&ndash;1899===
In 1860, pharmacists John (1834&ndash;1907) and Frank Wyeth opened a drugstore with a small research lab on Walnut Street in Philadelphia. In 1862, on the suggestion of doctors, they began to manufacture large quantities of commonly ordered medicines. They were successful, and in 1864 they began supplying medicines and beef extract to the Union army during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

In 1872, Henry Bower, an employee of Wyeth, developed one of the first rotary compressed tablet machines in the [[United States]]. This enabled the mass production of medicines with unprecedented precision and speed. It was successful, and the Wyeth brothers won multiple awards at the [[Centennial Exhibition]]. In 1883, Wyeth opened its first international facility in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]] and began vaccine production. Six years later a fire destroyed the brothers' original Walnut Street store, and they sold the retail business and focused on mass production.

===1900&ndash;1929===
John Wyeth died in 1907 and his only son, Stuart, became the company's president. '''American Home Products''', the holding company now known as Wyeth, was incorporated on February 4, 1926. The Whitehall building in downtown [[Manhattan]] became the corporation's first headquarters. Global sales increased due to the sales of Wyeth's [[Kolynos]] brand of toothpaste. In 1929, Stuart Wyeth died and left controlling interest to [[Harvard University]].

===1930&ndash;1949===
In 1930, Wyeth purchased [[Anacin]], a product for tension headaches which quickly became the company's flagship product. One year later, Harvard sold Wyeth to American Home Products for [[United States dollar|US$]]2.9 million.

In 1935, Alvin G. Brush, a [[Certified Public Accountant]], became [[CEO]] of the organization and served for 30 years. Under Brush's leadership, 34 new companies were acquired in 15 years, including [[Chef Boyardee]] and the ''S.M.A. Corporation'', a pharmaceutical firm specializing in infant formulas. Wyeth also made its first licensing deal, acquiring an antibiotic for [[arthritis]] [[vaccine]] research.

In 1941, the US entered [[World War II]], and Wyeth shipped typical wartime drugs such as [[sulfa]] bacteriostatics, [[blood plasma]], [[typhus]] vaccine, [[quinine]], and [[Quinacrine|atabrine]] tablets.  Wyeth was later rewarded for its contribution to the war effort. During this time, Wyeth launched its [[penicillin]] research facility with G. Raymond [[Rettew]]. In 1943, Wyeth purchased ''G. Washington Coffee Refining Company'', an [[instant coffee]] company created by [[George Washington (inventor)|George Washington]].

In 1943, Wyeth merged with ''Ayerst, McKenna and Harrison, Ltd.'' of Canada. With this merger came [[Premarin]], the world's first conjugated [[estrogen]] medicine, which was a flagship product for Wyeth until 2002, when preliminary results from the [[Women's Health Initiative]] linked it to a number of negative effects, including increased risk for breast cancer. Sales subsequently fell off worldwide.

Wyeth was one of 22 companies selected by the government in 1944 to manufacture penicillin for the military, and later for the general public. 

In 1945, Wyeth acquired the Fort Dodge Serum Company, entering the animal health field.

===1950&ndash;1969===
In 1951, Wyeth launched [[Antabuse]], a drug for the treatment of [[alcoholism]], as well as the [[antihistamine]] [[Phenergan]]. [[Ansolyen]] was launched the next year as a [[high blood pressure]] medication. The [[anticonvulsant]] [[Mysoline]] was introduced in 1954. Other drugs introduced during this time include [[Isordil]], a [[vasodilator]] for treatment of [[Angina pectoris|angina]], [[Dryvax]], a [[freeze-dried]] [[smallpox]] vaccine, and Ovral, a [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]. Pharmaceuticals were generating an ever-increasing percentage of Wyeth's sales.

Wyeth became a leading US vaccine producer after supplying [[polio]] vaccine for [[Jonas Salk|Salk]] trials. The corporate headquarters were moved to [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], Pennsylvania, where they remained until 2003. William F. Laporte became the Chairman and President of AHP in 1965, and served until 1981.

The [[World Health Organization]] initiated the [[Global Smallpox Eradication Program]] in 1967, and approached Wyeth to develop a better injection system for smallpox vaccines which could be used in the field. Wyeth waived [[patent]] royalties on its innovative [[bifurcated needle]], aiding in the delivery of over 200 million smallpox vaccines per year.

===1970&ndash;1989===
Wyeth's oral contraceptives became popular in the US. John W. Culligan, after becoming Chairman and CEO in 1981, spun off less profitable lines and focused resources on consumer and prescription drugs. Wyeth made history in 1984 with the introduction of [[Advil]], the first nonprescription [[ibuprofen]] in America, as well as the most famous prescription-to-OTC switch in history.

John R. Stafford became CEO and Chairman in 1986. He completed the divestiture of non-core businesses such as household products, foods (e.g., American Home Foods was sold to International Foods in 1996), candy (Brock Candy), and medical devices (e.g., its Sherwood-Medical Company was sold to Tyco-Kendal in 1997). Wyeth and [[Ayerst]] merged to form Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, thus strengthening and consolidating Wyeth's pharmaceutical operations.

In the late 1980s, Wyeth acquired the animal health businesses of [[Bristol-Myers]] and [[Parke-Davis]]. Wyeth also acquired A.H. Robins, makers of [[Robitussin]], [[ChapStick]], [[Dimetapp]], and the [[Dalkon Shield]] merging it into its Whitehall unit to establish its Whitehall-Robins Division.

===1990&ndash;1999===
In 1990, Reckitt & Colman (now [[Reckitt Benckiser]]) acquires Boyle-Midway from American Home Products. After a dediction of the food business, the [[PAM (cooking spray)|PAM]] trademark becomes part of American Home Foods.

[[Premarin]] becomes the #1 prescribed drug in the US in 1993. Effexor ([[venlafaxine]] HCl), the first [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRI), is introduced for the treatment of [[clinical depression]] and is later indicated for [[general anxiety disorder|generalized anxiety disorder]] and [[social anxiety disorder]]. 

In 1993, Wyeth founded the ''[[Women's Health Research Institute]]'', the only institute in the pharmaceutical industry entirely dedicated to research in women's health. The Institute conducts trials in [[menopause|menopausal]] issues, [[endometriosis]], [[contraception]], and more.

In 1994, Wyeth acquired [[American Cyanamid]] and its subsidiary Lederle Laboratories. This acquisition brought the Lederle Praxis vaccines, new [[research and development]] capacity, and [[Centrum (multivitamin)|Centrum]], the leading US [[multivitamin]]. Wyeth's sales topped [[United States dollar|US$]]13 billion in 1995; two years later, [[Premarin]] became the company's first brand to reach [[United States dollar|US$]]1 billion in sales. 

In 1995, Wyeth acquired the animal health division of [[Solvay (company)|Solvay]], which was folded into [[Fort Dodge Animal Health]]. The acquisition gave Fort Dodge Animal Health strong market presence in Europe and Asia as well as expanding its product portfolio to include swine and poultry vaccines.

In 1996, American Home Products spun off its food unit as [[International Home Foods]]. International Home Foods was purchased by [[ConAgra Foods]] in 2000.
Wyeth also purchases full ownership of [[Genetics Institute, Inc.]] after acquiring a majority interest in 1992.<ref>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/wyeth-history/ History of Wyeth] at ´Fundinguniverse.com. Retrieved 25.10.2012.</ref>

In 1997, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) requested that Wyeth withdraw its controversial diet drug [[fenfluramine]] from the market by after several reports of deaths and other health problems associated with the drug combination known as [[fen-phen]] occurred.<ref>{{pmid|9385873}}</ref>

In 1998, American Home Products was left at the altar by British pharma powerhouse [[SmithKline Beecham]], who pulled the plug on the estimated $70 billion merger.  The deal was reportedly killed in response to British regulators who feared losing jobs to a proposed US headquarters location.  (SmithKline Beecham merged with fellow Brit [[Glaxo Wellcome]] in 1999 to form the world's leading drug company.)  This was the start of a three-year losing streak in the mergers and acquisitions game for AHP.

In 1999, another American Home Products merger fell through, this time a proposed $34 billion merger-of-equals with chemical and biotech manufacturer [[Monsanto Company]].  Though the companies issued a combined statement saying the breakup was mutual "because (the deal) was not in the best interests of shareholders," rumors circulated that AHP had canceled the deal due to issues in the soon-to-be-combined boardroom.  (Monsanto announced in December 1999 that it would merge with [[Pharmacia]] & [[Upjohn]] instead; the new conglomerate eventually unloaded Monsanto again, before being bought themselves by [[Pfizer]] in 2003.)

===2000&ndash;2009===
* In 2000, American Home Products lost a [[United States dollar|US$]]65 billion friendly takeover bid for rival drug company [[Warner-Lambert]] in their most dramatic merger loss yet{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. After the merger announcement, [[Pfizer]] offered a competing hostile bid, primarily to save their half of a [[Lipitor]] joint venture with Warner (at the time the #1 prescription drug in the world){{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.  At one point talks were under way in which [[Procter & Gamble]] would help by buying both companies in a wild three-way merger, a rumor which cost P&G a 10% drop in its stock price{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.  Eventually, despite both CEOs going on tour to defend the deal to shareholders, Pfizer won Warner-Lambert and formed the second largest drug company in the world, while AHP had to settle for a [[United States dollar|US$]]1.8 billion [[poison pill|poison-pill]] payment{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

* Robert Essner, the company's former CEO, was appointed in 2001. On September 27, 2007, the Wyeth Board of Directors elected Bernard Poussot President and Chief Executive Officer effective on January 1, 2008.<ref>http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/personinfo/FromPersonIdPersonTearsheet.jhtml?passedPersonId=895899{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>

* On March 11, 2002, American Home Products changed its name to Wyeth, having spun off unrelated businesses in order to focus on pharmaceuticals.<ref>[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=78193&p=irol-faq#10673 Wyeth's investor FAQ]</ref>

* As part of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health]], a large-scale clinical trial for [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|Hormone Replacement Therapy]] showed that long-term use of [[progestin]] and [[estrogen]] may increase the risk of [[stroke]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s, [[blood clot]]s, and [[breast cancer]]. Following these results, Wyeth experienced a significant decline in its sales of Premarin, Prempro (conjugated [[equine]] [[estrogen]]s) and related hormones{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, from over $2 billion in 2002 to just over $1 billion in 2006.<ref>http://www.wyeth.com/irj/servlet/prt/portal/prtroot/com.sap.km.cm.docs/wyeth_xml/home/news/announcements/1170158273391.pdf</ref> The results from the study were significant enough that Wyeth terminated the trials early due to a fear that their participants may be at risk.

* Wyeth, as a corporation, filed a 'citizens complaint' with the United States FDA on October 16, 2005, requesting that the US FDA take action against pharmacies who compound, manufacture, or sell unlicensed [[Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy]] (BHRT) drugs to their patients.  Specifically, Wyeth asserted that the BHRT drugs are not licensed by the FDA according to section 505 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, misbranded and adulterated per sections 501 and 502 of 21 U.S.C. (paragraphs 351, 352, and 355).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/DOCKETS/dockets/05p0411/05p-0411-cp00001-01-vol1.pdf | format = PDF | last = Botha | first = S | date = 2005-10-06 | accessdate = 2010-01-27 | title = Submission of Citizen Petition on Behalf of Wyeth | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] }}</ref> Drug manufacturers are required to demonstrate through clinical trials that marketed drugs are safe and efficacious, a process that BHRT drugs have not undergone.  If honored, the request would require the same safety and efficacy data for those primarily engaged in [[alternative medicine]].

* The [[European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection]] blamed the presence of illegal steroids in the food supply on "fraudulent exchange and disposal of pharmaceutical waste". A Wyeth factory disposing of the byproducts from synthetic [[progesterone]] manufacture was the source of the contamination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2551 |title=Hormone food scandal rocks Europe |publisher=Newscientist.com |date=2002-07-16 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref>

* In 2003 Wyeth  reportedly contributed funds to a not-for-profit support group, The [[Meningitis Centre]], which lobbied the [[Australia]]n Government to introduce universal immunisation against [[Pneumococcus|pneumococcal]]  disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/21/1071941610958.html |title=Drug giant linked to immunisation campaign |publisher=Theage.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref> Wyeth produced the only [[pneumococcal vaccine]] approved for young children in Australia.

* During June 2009, an Arkansas federal judge granted public access to evidence that Wyeth Pharmaceuticals “ghostwrote” medical articles regarding its hormone therapy drug Prempro.  Along with ''[[The New York Times]]'',  PLoS Medicine, represented by the law firm Public Justice, had sought to intervene in a court case of women bringing an action in relation to Prempro and other hormone therapy drugs, in order to unseal papers that allegedly showed that Wyeth failed to disclose its role in preparing medical journal articles promoting Prempro and in recruiting academic authors to put their names on the articles for publication—that is that they practised ghost  writing.<ref>[http://speakingofmedicine.plos.org/2009/07/25/successful-intervention-by-plos-medicine-and-new-york-times-in-federal-court-grants-public-access-to-evidence-that-drug-company-%e2%80%98ghostwrote%e2%80%99-medical-articles-about-hormone-therapy-dru/ Successful intervention by PLoS Medicine and The New York Times in Federal court grants public access to evidence that drug company ‘ghostwrote’ medical articles about hormone therapy drug, Prempro]</ref>

* On October 15, 2009 Pfizer signed the final acquisition papers making Wyeth a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer, thus completing the [[United States dollar|US$]]68 billion dollar deal.<ref name=PfizerWyeth/>

===2012===
* Wyeth, now the name of the infant nutrition division of Pfizer, was bought by [[Nestle]] <ref>{{citation |title=Nestle close to buying Wyeth |journal=Global Times|date=2012-04-18|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/NEWS/tabid/99/ID/705595/Nestle-close-to-buying-Wyeth.aspx}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Rapamune===
A "whistleblower suit" was filed against Wyeth in 2005 alleging that the company illegally marketed their drug [[Rapamune]]. Wyeth is targeted in the suit for off-label marketing, targeting specific doctors and medical facilities to increased sales of Rapamune, trying to get current transplant patients to change from their current transplant drugs to Rapamune and for specifically targeting African-Americans. According to the whistleblowers, Wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals with kickbacks to prescribe the drug in the form of grants, donations and other money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmalot.com/2010/05/wyeth-targeted-blacks-with-illegal-marketing-lawsuit/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Pharmalot+%28Pharmalot%29 |title=Wyeth Marketing Targeted Blacks Illegally: Lawsuit // Pharmalot |publisher=Pharmalot.com |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=June 14, 2010 | By Tracy Staton |url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/congress-joins-probe-wyeths-rapamune-marketing/2010-06-14?utm_medium=nl&utm_source=internal |title=Congress joins probe into Wyeth's Rapamune marketing |publisher=FiercePharma |date=2010-06-14 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref> A US House of Representatives committee, led by Rep.

===Prempro===
Wyeth was sued for its marketing of Prempro, a [[hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]], which was implicated in the cancers of 14,000 patients.
