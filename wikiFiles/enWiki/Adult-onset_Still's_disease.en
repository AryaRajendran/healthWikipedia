'''Adult-onset Still's disease''' is a [[Systemic inflammation|systemic inflammatory]] [[disease]]. The classic presentation is the [[three|triad]] of persistent high spiking [[fever]], [[Arthralgia|joint pain]] and a distinctive salmon-colored [[rash]]. [[Serum ferritin]], a protein that binds iron, is elevated. There are no characteristic antibodies in the blood. The symptoms are similar to other inflammatory diseases and to autoimmune diseases which do have characteristic antibodies, which must be ruled out with tests for those antibodies. Prognosis is usually favorable but pulmonary, cardiovascular, and kidney manifestations may occasionally cause severe life-threatening complications.<ref name="Colafrancesco"/> It is treated first with steroids such as prednisone. [[Interleukin-1]] must play a part in the pathology, because drugs that block the action of IL-1, particularly IL-1β, are effective in treating it.

== History ==

Still's disease is named after [[United Kingdom|English]] [[physician]] [[Sir George Frederic Still]] (1861–1941).<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1773}}</ref><ref>G. F. Still. A special form of joint disease met with in children.

== Epidemiology ==

Adult-onset Still's Disease is rare and has been described all over the world.  Prevalence is estimated at 1.5 cases per 100,000-1,000,000 population.  There is a bimodal age distribution with one peak incidence between ages 15–25 and a second peak between ages of 36–46 years.<ref name="Owlia">{{cite journal |author=Owlia MB, Mehrpoor G. |title= Adult - onset Still's disease : A review|journal=Indian J Med Sci |volume=63 | issue = 5 | pages=207–21 |year=2009  |pmid=19584494|doi=10.4103/0019-5359.53169}}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==

The cause of adult-onset Still's disease is not known, but it presumably involves IL-1, since drugs that block the action of IL-1β are effective treatments. [[Interleukin-18]] is expressed at high levels.<ref name="Colafrancesco">{{cite journal

== Signs and symptoms ==
The disease typically presents with [[arthralgia]], fever, a 'salmon-pink' rash, and [[lymphadenopathy]]. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) are classically negative and [[serum ferritin]] is elevated. Patients experiencing a flare-up from Adult-onset Still's disease usually report extreme fatigue, swelling of the lymph glands, and less commonly fluid accumulation in the lungs and heart.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis is clinical, not based upon [[serology]].<ref name="pmid17538564">{{cite journal |author=Efthimiou P, Kontzias A, Ward CM, Ogden NS |title=Adult-onset Still's disease: can recent advances in our understanding of its pathogenesis lead to targeted therapy? |journal=Nat Clin Pract Rheumatol |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=328–35 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17538564 |doi=10.1038/ncprheum0510}}</ref> At least seven sets of diagnostic criteria have been devised, however the Yamaguchi criteria have the highest sensitivity.

== Treatment ==
One set of 21 adult-onset Still's disease patients were divided into four types, according to clinical course patterns. These included monocyclic systemic disease, polycyclic systemic disease, chronic articular monocyclic systemic disease, and chronic articular polycyclic systemic disease. Chronic articular disease and polyarticular disease were at higher risk to develop disabling arthritis.<ref>{{cite journal

Adult-onset Still's disease is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. [[Steroids]] such as [[prednisone]] are used to treat severe symptoms of Still's. Other commonly-used medications include [[hydroxychloroquine]], [[penicillamine]], [[azathioprine]], [[methotrexate]], [[etanercept]], [[anakinra]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[adalimumab]], [[rituximab]], and [[infliximab]].

Newer drugs target [[interleukin-1]] (IL-1), particularly IL-1β. A randomized, multicenter trial reported better outcomes in a group of 12 patients treated with anakinra than in a group of 10 patients taking other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

The condition "juvenile-onset Still's disease" is now usually grouped under [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]]. However, there is some evidence that the two conditions are closely related.<ref name="pmid12102485">{{cite journal |author=Luthi F, Zufferey P, Hofer MF, So AK |title="Adolescent-onset Still's disease": characteristics and outcome in comparison with adult-onset Still's disease |journal=Clin.
