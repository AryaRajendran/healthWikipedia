'''Richard Allison''' (1757 &ndash; March 22, 1816) was Physician General of the U.S. Army, the position that later became [[Surgeons General of the United States Army|Surgeon General]], from 1792 to 1796. He was the first physician to set up a permanent practice in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].

Allison was born near [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen, New York]] in 1757. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] he served as a [[surgeon's mate]] in the [[Pennsylvania Line]] of the [[Continental Army]]. He was the senior American military physician in the [[Northwest Indian War]], and became the surgeon general of General [[Anthony Wayne]]'s Legion when those troops were organized and defeated the Indians at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]]. On the re-organization of the army in 1789, he was appointed surgeon of a regiment of infantry, and became the ranking medical officer of the U.S. Army up to the time of his resignation. 

After living for a few years on his farm on the east fork of the [[Little Miami River]], he returned to the city in 1805, and continued to practice medicine until his death. [[Daniel Drake]] called him the "father of our local profession," and wrote of him that "though not profound in science, he was sagacious, unassuming, amiable and kind."
