'''''{{lang|la|Primum non nocere}}''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase that means "'''first, do no harm'''." The phrase is sometimes recorded as '''''{{lang|la|primum nil nocere}}'''''.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1,cdr:1,cd_min:Jan%201_2%201800,cd_max:Dec%2031_2%201970&tbo=p&q=%22primum+nil+nocere%22&num=10 Google book search, 1800–1970]</ref>

'''Non-maleficence''', which is derived from the maxim, is one of the principal precepts of [[medical ethics]] that all medical students are taught in [[medical school]] and is a fundamental principle for [[emergency medical services]] around the world. Another way to state it is that, "given an existing problem, it may be better not to do something, or even to do nothing, than to risk causing more harm than good". It reminds the [[physician]] and other health care providers that they must consider the possible harm that any intervention might do. It is invoked when debating the use of an intervention that carries an obvious risk of harm but a less certain chance of benefit.

Non-maleficence is often contrasted with its corollary, [[Beneficence_(ethics)|beneficence]].

== Origin ==

The origin of the phrase is uncertain. The [[Hippocratic Oath]] includes the promise "to abstain from doing harm" ({{lang-el|ἐπὶ δηλήσει δὲ καὶ ἀδικίῃ εἴρξειν}}) but does not include the precise phrase. Perhaps the closest approximation in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]] is in ''Epidemics'':<ref>''[http://www.eastridges.com/wesley/primum.html Primum non nocere]'' &ndash; Tells why "''primum non nocere''" is not actually from Hippocrates, but is a phrase in the ''Epidemics''</ref> "The physician must ... have two special objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm" (book I, sect. 11, trans. Adams, {{lang-el|ἀσκέειν, περὶ τὰ νουσήματα, δύο, ὠφελέειν, ἢ μὴ βλάπτειν}}). 

According to Gonzalo Herranz, Professor of Medical Ethics at the University of Navarre, ''Primum non nocere'' was introduced into American and [[UK|British]] medical culture by [[Worthington Hooker]] in his 1847 book ''Physician and Patient''. Hooker attributed it to the [[Paris]]ian pathologist and clinician [[Auguste François Chomel]] (1788&ndash;1858), the successor of [[René Laennec|Laennec]] in the chair of medical pathology, and the preceptor of [[Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis|Pierre Louis]]. Apparently, the axiom was part of Chomel's oral teaching.<ref>"The origin of ''primum non nocere''." ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' electronic responses and commentary, 1 September 2002.</ref>

However, close examination reveals that Hooker did not use the specific expression or the traditional Latin phrase. A detailed investigation of the origins of the [[aphorism]] was reported by the clinical pharmacologist Cedric M. Smith in the April 2005 issue of ''[[The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=C. M. |year=2005 |title=Origin and Uses of ''Primum Non Nocere'' — Above All, Do No Harm! |journal=[[The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology]] |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=371–377 |doi=10.1177/0091270004273680 }}</ref> It addresses the questions of the origin and chronology of appearance of the maxim. Rather than being of ancient origin as usually assumed, the specific expression, and its even more distinctive associated Latin phrase, has been traced back to an attribution to [[Thomas Sydenham]] (1624&ndash;1689) in a book by [[Thomas Inman]] (1860), ''Foundation for a New Theory and Practice of Medicine''.  Inman's book and his attribution were [[Academic journal#Book reviews|review]]ed by a person who signed themselves only as "H. H." in ''[[The American Journal of the Medical Sciences]]'', also in 1860.<ref name="TAJMS">{{Cite journal |journal=[[The American Journal of the Medical Sciences]] |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_QEHAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA450&dq=inman+The+American+Journal+of+the+Medical+Sciences+page+450&hl=en&sa=X&ei=frwjUaefDIro9ATG1YHgDA&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=inman%20The%20American%20Journal%20of%20the%20Medical%20Sciences%20page%20450&f=false |editor-last=Hays |editor-first=Isaac |editor-link=Isaac Hays |year =1860 |title=Book review of ''Foundation for a New Theory and Practice of Medicine'' |author=Inman, Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Inman |volume=Vol. XL |location=Philadelphia, PA |pages=pp. 450-458 |publisher=Blanchard and Lea}}</ref>  A prominent American surgeon, [[L.A. Stimson|L. A. Stimson]], used the expression in 1879 and again in 1906 (in the same journal). That it was in common use by the 20th century is apparent from later mentions, such as by the prominent [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] [[J. Whitridge Williams]] in 1911, as well as detailed discussion of its use in a popular book authored by [[Dr. Morris Fishbein]], the long-time editor of ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (''JAMA'') in 1930. 

The article also reviews the various uses of the now popular aphorism, its limitations as a moral injunction, as well as the increasing frequency of its use not only in medical but other contexts as well.
