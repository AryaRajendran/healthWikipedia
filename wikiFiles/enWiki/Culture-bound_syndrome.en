In [[medicine]] and [[medical anthropology]], a '''culture-bound syndrome''', '''culture-specific syndrome''' or '''folk illness''' is a combination of psychiatric and somatic [[symptoms]] that are considered to be a recognizable disease only within a specific society or [[culture]]. There are no objective biochemical or structural alterations of [[organ (anatomy)|body organs]] or functions, and the disease is not recognized in other cultures. While a substantial portion of mental disorders, in the way they are manifested and experienced, are at least partially conditioned by the culture in which they are found, some disorders are more culture-specific than others. Folk illnesses tend to carry psychological and/or religious overtones.<ref>[http://www.rice.edu/projects/HispanicHealth/Courses/mod7/mod7.html Folk Medicine in Hispanics in the Southwestern United States, Nancy Neff, M.D., Assistant Professor, Department of Community Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine]</ref>

Even though the concept is controversial, the term ''culture-bound syndrome'' was included in the fourth version of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[American Psychiatric Association]], 1994) which also includes a list of the most common culture-bound conditions ([[DSM-IV]]: Appendix I). American [[psychiatrist]] and [[medical anthropology|medical anthropologist]] [[Arthur Kleinman]] has contributed much to the understanding of these syndromes.

==The identification of culture-specific syndromes==

A culture-specific syndrome is characterized by:
# categorization as a [[disease]] in the culture (i.e., not a voluntary behaviour or false claim);
# widespread familiarity in the culture;
# complete lack of familiarity of the condition to people in other cultures;
# no objectively demonstrable biochemical or tissue abnormalities (symptoms);
# the condition is usually recognized and treated by the [[folk medicine]] of the culture.

Some culture-specific syndromes involve somatic symptoms (pain or disturbed function of a body part), while others are purely behavioral. Some culture-bound syndromes appear with similar features in several cultures, but with locally-specific traits, such as [[penis panic]]s.

A culture-specific syndrome is not the same as a geographically localized disease with specific, identifiable, causal tissue abnormalities, such as [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]] or [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], or genetic conditions limited to certain populations. It is possible that a condition originally assumed to be a culture-bound behavioral syndrome is found to have a biological cause; from a medical perspective it would then be redefined into another [[nosology|nosological]] category.

==Medical perspectives==
An interesting aspect of culture-specific syndromes is the extent to which they are "real". Characterizing them as "imaginary" is as inaccurate as characterizing them as "[[malingering]]". Culture-specific syndromes shed light on how our [[mind]] decides that symptoms are connected and how a society defines a known "disease".  The American Psychiatric Association states the following:<ref>{{Citation

<blockquote>The term ''culture-bound syndrome'' denotes recurrent, locality-specific patterns of aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be "illnesses," or at least afflictions, and most have local names. Although presentations conforming to the major DSM-IV categories can be found throughout the world, the particular symptoms, course, and social response are very often influenced by local cultural factors. In contrast, culture-bound syndromes are generally limited to specific societies or culture areas and are localized, folk, diagnostic [comma sic] categories that frame coherent meanings for certain repetitive, patterned, and troubling sets of experiences and observations.</blockquote>

Medical care of the condition is challenging and illustrates a truly fundamental but rarely discussed aspect of the physician-patient relationship: the need to negotiate a [[diagnosis]] that fits the way of looking at the body and its diseases of both parties. The [[physician]] may do any of the following:
# Share the way the patient sees the disorder, and offer the folk medicine treatment
# Recognize it as a culture-bound syndrome, but pretend to share the patient’s perspectives and offer the folk medicine treatment or a new improvised treatment
# Recognize it as a culture-bound syndrome but try to educate the patient into seeing the condition as the physician sees it

The problem with choice 1 is that physicians who pride themselves on their knowledge of [[disease]] may like to think they know the difference between culture-specific disorders and "organic" diseases. While choice 2 may be the quickest and most comfortable choice, the physician must deliberately deceive the patient. Currently in [[Western culture]] this is considered one of the most [[medical ethics|unethical]] things a physician can do, whereas in other times and cultures deception with benevolent intent has been an accepted tool of treatment. Choice 3 is the most difficult and time-consuming to do without leaving the patient disappointed, insulted, or lacking confidence in the physician, and may leave both physician and patient haunted by doubts ("Maybe the condition ''is'' real." or "Maybe this doctor doesn’t know what s/he is talking about.").{{Synthesis-inline|date=March 2010}}

The term ''culture-bound syndrome'' has, in many ways, been a controversial topic since it has reflected the different opinions of anthropologists and psychiatrists.<ref>Perry, S. (2012, 13 January). The controversy over 'culture-bound' mental illnesses. Retrieved 27 January 2013 from MinnPost.[http://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/01/controversy-over-culture-bound-mental-illnesses]</ref> Anthropologists have a tendency to emphasize the relativistic and culture-specific dimensions of the syndromes, while physicians tend to emphasize the universal and neuropsychological dimensions (Prince, 2000; Jilek, 2001).<ref>Prince, Raymond H. (2000) ''In Review. Transcultural Psychiatry: Personal Experiences and Canadian Perspectives''. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 45: 431–437</ref><ref>Jilek W.G (2001) ''Psychiatric Disorders: Culture-specific''. International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences. Elsevier Science Ltd.</ref> Guarnaccia & Rogler (1999) have argued in favor of investigating culture-bound syndromes on their own terms, and believe that the syndromes have enough cultural integrity to be treated as independent objects of research.<ref>Guarnaccia, Peter J. & Rogler, Lloyd H. (1999) ''Research on Culture-Bound Syndromes: New Directions''. American Journal of Psychiatry 156:1322–1327, September</ref>
Some studies suggest that culture-bound syndromes represent an acceptable way within a specific culture (and cultural context) among certain vulnerable individuals (i.e. an ''[[#DSM-IV list of culture-bound syndromes|ataque de nervios]]'' at a funeral in Puerto Rico) to express distress in the wake of a traumatic experience.<ref>Schechter DS, Marshall RD, Salman E, Goetz D, Davies SO, Liebowitz MR (2000). Ataque de nervios and childhood trauma history: An association? Journal of Traumatic Stress, 13:3, 529–534.</ref> A similar manifestation of distress when displaced into a North American medical culture may lead to a very different, even adverse outcome for a given individual and [his or] her family.<ref>Schechter DS, Kaminer, T, Grienenberger JF, Amat J (2003). Fits and starts: A mother-infant case study involving pseudoseizures across three generations in the context of violent trauma history (with Commentaries by RD Marshall, CH Zeanah, T Gaensbauer). Infant Mental Health Journal. 24(5), 510–28.</ref>

The definition of such conditions logically leads to the conclusion that they are viewed within their culture as [[Norm (sociology)|"normal"]] in the limited sense of a readily possible, if not necessarily common or beneficial, manner of behavior. This probably accounts for the scarcity of English-language work on Western culture-bound syndromes, though these conditions are existent and some researchers have attempted to treat with the phenomena in their own parent cultures.{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}<ref>http://www.springerlink.com/content/gx6821m8ul37781v/</ref>

In 1980, social anthropologist and physician [[Dan Blumhagen]] put forward the theory that folk illnesses and formal medical illnesses are not mutually exclusive.<ref>Blumhagen D. Hyper-Tension: a folk illness with a medical name. Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry 1980; 4:197–227</ref> Based upon his research with [[hypertension]] sufferers he concluded that the condition can be misdiagnosed by the layperson by associating the plain English name of illness with its literal meaning; in this case all pressure or "tension" in the extremities could be self-diagnosed as hyper-tension.
