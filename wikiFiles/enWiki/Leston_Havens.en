'''Leston Laycock Havens''' (July 31, 1924{{ndash}}July 29, 2011) was an American [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychotherapist]] known best for his work on biological psychiatry, rehabilitation of severely ill patients, and methods of interviewing patients.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Early life==
Leston was born on July 31, 1924 in New York City. He grew up in Brooklyn with his father, a lawyer. It was thought that he would follow in his father's footsteps and become a lawyer. Instead, Leston went to [[Williams College]] in Williamstown, Massachusetts where he studied English and History as well as Philosophy.<ref name="GlobeObit" /> He graduated with his B.A. Magna cum Laude in 1947. After graduation, he joined the Army and served on [[Tinian]], an island in the pacific, where he located and detonated abandoned ammunition.

==Academic life==
After returning from his service in the military, Leston attended the [[Cornell Medical School]], graduating with his M.D. in 1952. He served as an intern in Internal Medicine at the [[New York Hospital]] and stayed there until 1954 as an Assistant Resident. He completed his residency from 1954-1958 at the [[Boston Psychopathic Hospital]] (now the [[Massachusetts Mental Health Center]]). This began a long connection with the [[Harvard University Medical School]]. In 1954, Leston was appointed as a Teaching Fellow in Psychiatry at Harvard and by 1971 was promoted to full professor status at Harvard Medical School. While at Mass Mental, he founded the Psychopharmacology Unit; one of the first in the country and one that would become famous. There he completed many studies on [[Electroconvulsive Therapy]]. Between 1964 and 1982 Havens directed the medical student clerkship at Mass Mental and from 1987-1996 he directed the psychiatry residency at the Cambridge Hospital. At Cambridge Hospital he was a beloved teacher and mentor who influenced the development of many young psychiatrists. He was an iconoclast and great patient advocate, teaching his students to listen and relate to their patients and not categorize or pathologize them.

==Awards==
Leston Havens received many awards throughout his career.<ref>{{cite web|last=Havens|first=Leston|title=C.V|url=http://www.lestonhavensmd.com/resume.html}}</ref>
