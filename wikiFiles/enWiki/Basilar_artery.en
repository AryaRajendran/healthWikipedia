In [[human anatomy]], the '''basilar artery''' is one of the [[artery|arteries]] that supplies the [[brain]] with oxygen-rich blood. 

The two [[Vertebral artery|vertebral arteries]] and the basilar artery are sometimes together called the ''vertebrobasilar system'', which supplies blood to the posterior part of [[circle of Willis]] and anastomoses with blood supplied to the anterior part of the circle of Willis from the [[Internal carotid artery|internal carotid arteries]].

==Course==
It arises from the confluence of the two [[vertebral artery|vertebral arteries]] at the junction between the [[medulla oblongata]] and the [[pons]]. 

It ascends in the central gutter (sulcus basilaris) inferior to the [[pons]] and divides into the [[posterior cerebral artery|posterior cerebral arteries]] and the [[superior cerebellar artery]] just inferior to the pituitary stalk. 

From the basilar artery arises the [[anterior inferior cerebellar artery]] (supplying the superior and inferior aspects of the [[cerebellum]]), as well as smaller branches for the supply of the pons (the pontine branches).

In under 15 % of people the basilar artery gives rise to the [[labyrinthine artery]].
