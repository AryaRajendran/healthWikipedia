One author describes the potential as "limitless.".<ref>Crespo, R. 2007. [[Virtual community|Virtual Community]] [[Health promotion|Health Promotion]]. Preventing [[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic Disease]], 4(3) : 75</ref> Another author interprets the "2.0" moniker as a "second generation medicine": "There is however also a broader idea behind Medicine 2.0 or “second generation medicine”: the notion that healthcare systems need to move away from hospital-based medicine, focus on promoting health, provide healthcare in people's own homes, and empower consumers to take responsibility for their own health".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> This is facilitated by emerging technologies, for example, a "combination of two trends—Personal Health Records combined with social networking —[which] may lead to a powerful new generation of health applications, where people share parts of their electronic health records with other consumers and “crowdsource” the collective wisdom of other patients and professionals." <ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Definitions and Inclusions==
The "2.0" moniker is associated with concepts like social networking, collaboration, openess, and participation.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The "Traditional" definition focuses on technology as an enabler for care '''collaboration'''--

"The use of social software and light-weight tools to promote collaboration between patients, their caregivers, medical professionals, and other stakeholders in health"<ref>Adapted from Jane Sarasohn-Kahn's "Wisdom of Patients" report, by Matthew Holt, Last updated June 6, 2008</ref>
An expanded version of the traditional definition breaks this into components:
#[[Personalized search]] that looks into the long tail, but cares about the user experience.
#Communities that capture the accumulated knowledge of patients and caregivers; and clinicians—and explain it to the world,
#Intelligent tools for content delivery—and transactions, and
#Better integration of data with content. All with the result of patients increasingly guiding their own care<ref>"Holt's evolving view of a moving target", by Matthew Holt, updated from original September 20, 2007 presentation at Health 2.0 Conference, October 22, 2008</ref>
Scott Shreeve considers Health 2.0 as a wider system reform--

"New concept of health care wherein all the constituents (patients, physicians, providers, and payers) focus on health care value (outcomes/price) and use competition at the medical condition level over the full cycle of care as the catalyst for improving the safety, efficiency, and quality of health care"<ref>Last updated on May 25, 2007 Scott Shreeve, MD - January 24, 2007)</ref>
Then there's the concept of Health 2.0 as a participatory process between patient and clinician (with a couple of notable twists) --

Health 2.0 defines the combination of health data and health information with (patient) experience through the use of ICT, enabling the citizen to become an active and responsible partner in his/her own health and care pathway.<ref>"Patient 2.0 Empowerment", Lodewijk Bos, Andy Marsh, Denis Carroll, Sanjeev Gupta, Mike Rees, Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference on Semantic Web & Web Services SWWS08, Hamid R. Arabnia, Andy Marsh (eds), pp.&nbsp;164–167, 2008, http://www.icmcc.org/pdf/ICMCCSWWS08.pdf</ref>

Health 2.0 is '''participatory''' healthcare. Enabled by information, software, and community that we collect or create, we the patients can be effective partners in our own healthcare, and we the people can participate in reshaping the health system itself.<ref>Ted Eytan MD, June 6, 2008, http://www.tedeytan.com/2008/06/13/1089</ref>
Definitions of Medicine 2.0 appear to be very similar but typically include more scientific and research aspects—Medicine 2.0: "Medicine 2.0 applications, services and tools are Web-based services for health care consumers, caregivers, patients, health professionals, and biomedical researchers, that use Web 2.0 technologies as well as semantic web and virtual reality tools, to enable and facilitate specifically social networking, participation, apomediation, collaboration, and openness within and between these user groups.<ref>Eysenbach, Gunther.

Health 2.0 is evolving fast as the technology landscape evolves. As does the desire by healthcare professionals and by patients to embrace new technology and new services. However, already there are signs of Health 3.0 emerging. [http://www.disruptivedemographics.com/2010/04/health-30-new-data-on-aging-boomers.html Health 3.0] is defined as delivery of healthcare which leverages the use of elements of [[Semantic Web]] such as [[location awareness]], the emerging [[Internet of Things]] and embedded sensors. [http://www.socialf5.com/blog/2011/05/web-2-0-doctors/ Doctors 2.0] are also leveraging social media as a powerful tool. Dedicated social networking sites for doctors like Sermo, SocialMD, Ozmosis etc. are doctor-only social networks. Here the doctors get a chance to interact and share knowledge with other doctors. Doctors are entering into the field of blogging, where they share their experiences in the form of case studies, give insight about diseases, discuss common healthcare issues, and offer simple remedies for them.

== Overview ==

[[File:Swan Health 2.0 model.jpg|thumb|A model of Health 2.0]]
Health 2.0 refers to a number of related concepts including [[telemedicine]], [[electronic medical records]], [[mHealth]], [[Connected Health]], and the use of the internet by patients themselves such as through [[messageboards]], [[blogs]], and other more advanced systems. A key concept is that patients themselves should have greater insight and control into information generated about them. Traditional models of medicine had patient records (held on paper or a proprietary [[computer system]]) that could only be accessed by a physician or other [[Health profession|medical professional]]. Physicians acted as gatekeepers to this information, telling patients test results when and if they deemed necessary. Such a model operates relatively well in situations such as acute care, where information about specific blood results would be of little use to a [[Laity|lay person]], or in general practice where results were generally benign. However, in the case of complex chronic diseases, [[Mental illness|psychiatric disorders]], or diseases of unknown etiology patients were at risk of being left without well-coordinated care because data about them was stored in a variety of disparate places and in some cases might contain the opinions of healthcare professionals which were not to be shared with the patient. Increasingly, [[medical ethics]] considers such actions to be [[Paternalism|medical paternalism]] and are discouraged in [[Medicine|modern medicine]].

A hypothetical example demonstrates the increased engagement of a patient operating in a Health 2.0 setting: A patient goes to see their [[primary care physician]] with a presenting complaint, having first ensured his own [[medical record]] was up to date via the internet. The treating physician might make a diagnosis or send for tests, the results of which could be transmitted direct to the patient's electronic medical record. If a second appointment is needed the patient will have had time to research what the results might mean for them, what diagnoses may be likely, and may have communicated with other patients who have had a similar set of results in the past. On a second visit a referral might be made to a specialist. The patient might have the opportunity to search for the views of other patients on the best specialist to go to, and in combination with their primary care physician decides who to see. The specialist gives a diagnosis along with a prognosis and potential options for treatment. The patient has the opportunity to research these treatment options and take a more proactive role in coming to a joint decision with their healthcare provider. They can also choose to submit more data about themselves, such as through a personalized genomics service to identify any [[risk factors]] that might improve or worsen their prognosis. As treatment commences, the patient can track their health outcomes through a data-sharing patient community to determine whether the treatment is having an effect for them, and can stay up to date on research opportunities and [[clinical trial]]s for their condition. They also have the [[social support]] of communicating with other patients diagnosed with the same condition throughout the world.

== Level of use of Web 2.0 in Health Care ==
Partly due to weak definitions, the novelty of the endeavor, and as an entrepreneurial (rather than academic) movement, little [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] exists to understand how much Web 2.0 is being used in general. While it has been estimated that nearly one-third of the 100m Americans who have looked for health information online say that they or people they know have been significantly helped by what they found.,<ref>Levy, M. 2007. Online Health. Assessing the Risk and Opportunity of Social and One-to-One Media.  Jupiter Research. Accessed at http://www.jupiterresearch.com/bin/item.pl/research:vision/103/id=98795/ on 20/1/2008</ref> this study considers only the broader use of the Internet for health management.

A study examining physician practice has suggested that a segment of 245,000 physicians in the U.S are using Web 2.0 for their practice, indicating that use is beyond the stage of the [[Diffusion (business)|early adopter]] with regard to physicians and Web 2.0.<ref>Manhattan Research, LLC. 2007. White Paper: Physicians and Web 2.0: 5 Things You Should Know about the Evolving Online Landscape for Physicians. Accessed at http://www.manhattanresearch.com/TTPWhitePaper.aspx on 20/1/2008</ref>

== Types of Web 2.0 technology in Health Care ==
Web 2.0 is commonly associated with technologies such as weblogs ([[health blog]]s), [[social bookmarking]], wikis, podcasts, [[RSS (file format)|RSS feeds]] (and other forms of [[many-to-many]] publishing), [[social software]], and [[web application]] programming interfaces (APIs) (see main article [[Web 2.0]]).

== Criticism of the use of Web 2.0 in health ==
Several criticisms have been raised in the use of Web 2.0 in health.  Firstly, the limitations for [[Physician|Medical Doctors]] (MDs) to use Google as a [[Diagnosis|diagnostic tool]], which may be more effective only for conditions with unique symptoms and signs that can easily be used as search term.<ref name=TanNg/> Secondly, long-held concerns exist about the effects of patients obtaining information online, such as the idea that patients may delay seeking medical advice.<ref>Ojalvo, H. E. (1996). Online advice: Good medicine or cyber-quackery? Retrieved September 22, 2007 from http://www.acponline.org/journals/news/dec96/cybrquak.htm</ref> Finally concerns exist about the quality of [[User-generated content|user generated content]] leading to misinformation, though one study has suggested that in certain [[support group]]s only 6% of information is factually wrong and that only 3% reported that online advice had caused serious harm.<ref>Economist, The. 2007. Health 2.0 : Technology and society: Is the outbreak of cancer videos, bulimia blogs and other forms of “user generated” medical information a healthy trend? The Economist, September 6: 73-74</ref>  Other venues of information are likely to be less useful to the general public.

== Tensions in Health 2.0 ==
Hughes ''et al.'' (2009) argue there are four major tensions represent in the literature on Health/Medicine 2.0: these are over the lack of clear definitions; issues around the loss of control over information that doctors perceive; safety and the dangers of inaccurate information; and issues of ownership and privacy.<ref name="jmir.org"/>
