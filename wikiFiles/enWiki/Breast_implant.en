A '''breast implant''' is a [[prosthesis|medical prosthesis]] used to augment, reconstruct, or create the physical form of [[breast]]s.  Breast implants are applied to correct the size, form, and feel of a woman’s [[breast]]s in post–[[mastectomy]] [[breast reconstruction]]; for correcting [[congenital defect]]s and [[Congenital abnormality|deformities]] of the chest wall; for aesthetic [[breast augmentation]]; and for creating breasts in the [[Sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|male-to-female transsexual]] patient. 

There are three general types of '''breast implant device''', defined by the filler material: saline, silicone, and composite. The '''saline implant''' has an [[elastomer]] [[silicone]] shell filled with sterile [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]]; the '''silicone implant''' has an elastomer silicone shell filled with viscous [[silicone]] gel; and the '''alternative composition''' implants featured miscellaneous fillers, such as [[soy|soy oil]], [[String breast implant|polypropylene string]], et cetera.

In surgical practice, for the reconstruction of a breast, the '''[[Tissue expansion|tissue expander]]''' device is a temporary breast prosthesis used to form and establish an implant pocket for the permanent breast implant. For the correction of male breast and chest-wall defects and deformities, the '''pectoral implant''' is the breast prosthesis used for the reconstruction and the aesthetic repair of a man’s chest.

==History==
[[Image:Vincenz Czerny.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Breast implant: Dr. Vincenz Czerny (1842–1916) a pioneer in [[breast reconstruction]] surgery.]]
;The 19th century
Since the late nineteenth century, '''breast implant devices''' have been used to [[Plastic surgery|surgically]] augment the size (volume), modify the shape (contour), and enhance the feel (tact) of a woman’s breasts. In 1895, surgeon [[Vincenz Czerny]] effected the earliest breast implant emplacement when he used the patient's autologous [[adipose tissue]], harvested from a benign [[lumbar]] [[lipoma]], to repair the asymmetry of the breast from which he had removed a tumor.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Czerny V | title = Plastischer Ersatz der Brusthus durch ein Lipoma | journal = Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie | year = 1895 | volume = 27 | pages = 72 | url= }}</ref> In 1889, surgeon Robert Gersuny experimented with [[Alkane|paraffin]]<!--?--> injections, with disastrous results. From the first half of the twentieth century, physicians used other substances as breast implant fillers — [[ivory]], glass balls, ground [[rubber]], [[ox]] [[cartilage]], [[Terylene]] [[wool]], [[gutta-percha]], [[Dicora]], [[polyethylene]] chips, Ivalon ([[polyvinyl alcohol]] – formaldehyde polymer sponge), a polyethylene sac with Ivalon, polyether foam sponge (Etheron), polyethylene tape (Polystan) strips wound into a ball, [[polyester]] (polyurethane foam sponge) Silastic rubber, and teflon-silicone prostheses.<ref>{{cite book | author = Bondurant S, Ernster V, Herdman R (eds); Committee on the Safety of Silicone Breast Implants | title = Safety of Silicone Breast Implants | publisher = Institute of Medicine | year = 1999 | url = http://www.nap.edu/books/0309065321/html/21.html | isbn = 0-309-06532-1 | page = 21}}</ref>

;The 20th century
In the mid-twentieth century, Morton I. Berson, in 1945, and Jacques Maliniac, in 1950, each performed flap-based breast augmentations by rotating the patient’s chest wall tissue into the breast to increase its volume. Furthermore, throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, plastic surgeons used synthetic fillers — including [[silicone]] injections received by some 50,000 women, from which developed silicone [[granuloma]]s and breast hardening that required treatment by [[mastectomy]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Anderson N| title = Lawsuit Science: Lessons from the Silicone Breast Implant Controversy | journal = New York Law School Law Review | year = 1997 | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 401–07 | url= }}</ref> In 1961, the American plastic surgeons Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow, and the [[Dow Corning Corporation]], developed the first '''silicone breast prosthesis''', filled with silicone gel; in due course, the first '''[[Breast augmentation|augmentation mammoplasty]]''' was performed in 1962 using the '''Cronin–Gerow Implant, prosthesis model 1963'''. In 1964, the French company Laboratoires Arion developed and manufactured the '''saline breast implant''', filled with [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]], and then introduced for use as a [[medical device]] in 1964.<ref name="Stevens">{{cite journal|author=Stevens WG, Hirsch EM, Stoker DA, Cohen R.|title=In vitro Deflation of Pre-filled Saline Breast Implants | journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | year=2006|pages=347–349| volume=118|issue=2|pmid=16874200|doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000227674.65284.80}}</ref>

;There are three types of breast implant used for [[mammoplasty]], [[breast reconstruction]], and [[breast augmentation]] procedures
# '''saline implant''' filled with sterile [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]].
# '''silicone implant''' filled with viscous [[silicone]] gel.
# '''alternative-composition implant''' with miscellaneous fillers (e.g. [[soy|soy oil]], [[String breast implant|polypropylene string]], etc.) that are no longer manufactured.

;I. — Saline implants
* Surgical technology
The '''saline breast implant''' is filled with [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]] (biological-concentration salt water 0.90% [[Mass concentration (chemistry)|w/v]] of [[sodium chloride|NaCl]], ca. 300 [[Osmolality|mOsm]]/L.). The early models were a relatively delicate technology that were prone to failure, usually shell breakage, leakage of the saline filler, and deflation of the prosthesis. Contemporary models of saline breast implant are made with stronger, room-temperature [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] (RTV) shells made of a [[silicone]] [[elastomer]]. The study ''In vitro Deflation of Pre-filled Saline Breast Implants'' (2006) reported that the rates of deflation (filler leakage) of the '''pre-filled saline breast implant''' made it a second choice for corrective [[Mammoplasty|breast surgery]], after the silicone gel type of breast implant.<ref name="Stevens" /> Nonetheless, in the 1990s, in U.S. medicine, the saline breast implant was the usual breast prosthesis applied for [[breast augmentation]], given the unavailability of silicone implants, because of the import restrictions of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

* Surgical technique
The saline breast implant was developed to facilitate a more conservative surgical technique, of smaller and fewer cuts to the breast, for emplacing an empty breast-implant device through a smaller surgical incision.<ref name="Arion1965">{{cite journal|author=Arion HG|title=Retromammary Prosthesis |journal=C R Societé Française de Gynécologie | year=1965|volume=5}}</ref> In surgical praxis, after having  emplaced the empty breast implants into the implant pockets, the plastic surgeon then fills each breast prosthesis with [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]], and, because the required insertion incisions are small, the resultant incision-scars will be smaller than the surgical scar usual to the long incision required for inserting pre-filled, silicone-gel implants. Although the saline breast implant can yield good-to-excellent results of breast size, contour, and feel, when compared to silicone-implant results, the saline implant is likelier to cause cosmetic problems such as rippling, wrinkling, and being noticeable to the eye and to the touch. This is especially true for women with very little [[breast]] tissue, and for [[Mastectomy|post-mastectomy]] reconstruction patients; thus, silicone-gel implants are the superior [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] device for [[breast augmentation]] and for [[breast reconstruction]]. In the case of the woman with much breast tissue, for whom partial submuscular emplacement is the recommended surgical technique, saline breast implants can afford an aesthetic “look” of breast size and contour (though not feel) much like that afforded by the silicone implant.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eisenberg, TS | title = Silicone Gel Implants Are Back - So What? | journal = American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery | year = 2009 | volume = 26 | pages = 5–7 | url= }}</ref>

;II. — Silicone gel implants
As a [[medical device]] [[technology]], there are five (5) generations of silicone breast implant, each defined by common model-manufacturing techniques.

;First generation
The '''Cronin–Gerow Implant, prosthesis model 1963''', was a tear-drop-shaped sac (silicone rubber envelope) filled with viscous silicone-gel. To reduce the rotation of the emplaced breast-implant upon the chest wall, it was affixed to the implant pocket with a fastener-patch of Dacron material ([[Polyethylene terephthalate]]) attached to the rear of the breast implant shell.<ref name=Cronin_1963>{{cite journal | author = Cronin TD, Gerow FJ | title = Augmentation Mammaplasty: A New "natural feel" Prosthesis | journal = Excerpta Medica International Congress Series | year = 1963 | volume = 66 | pages = 41 | url= }}</ref>

;Second generation
In the 1970s, the first technological development, a thinner device-shell and a thinner, low-cohesion silicone-gel filler, improved the functionality and verisimilitude (size, look, and feel) of the silicone breast implant. Yet, in clinical practice, the second-generation proved fragile, and suffered greater incidences of shell rupture, and of “silicone gel bleed” (filler leakage through an intact shell). The consequent, increased incidence-rates of medical complications (e.g. [[capsular contracture]]) precipitated U.S. government faulty-product [[Class action|class action-lawsuits]] against the Dow Corning Corporation, and other manufacturers of prosthetic breast prostheses.

* The second technological development was a '''[[polyurethane]] foam coating''' for the implant shell; it reduced the incidence of [[capsular contracture]] by causing an [[Inflammation|inflammatory reaction]] that impeded the formation of a capsule of fibrous [[collagen]] tissue around the breast implant. Nevertheless, the medical use of polyurethane-coated breast implants was briefly discontinued because of the potential health-risk posed by [[2,4-toluenediamine]] (TDA), a [[carcinogen]]ic by-product of the chemical breakdown of the implant’s polyurethane foam coating.<ref name="Luu11998">{{cite journal | author=Luu HM, Hutter JC, Bushar HF | title=A Physiologically based Pharmacokinetic Model for 2,4-toluenediamine Leached from Polyurethane foam-covered Breast Implants | journal=Environ Health Perspect | year=1998 | pages=393–400 | volume=106 | issue=7 | pmid=9637796 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/1998/106p393-400luu/luu-full.html | doi=10.2307/3434066 | pmc=1533137 | jstor=3434066 | publisher=Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol. 106, No. 7}}</ref> After reviewing the medical data, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] concluded that TDA-induced [[breast cancer]] was an infinitesimal health-risk to women with breast implants, and did not justify legally requiring physicians to explain the matter to their patients. In the event, polyurethane-coated breast implants remain in [[Breast augmentation|plastic surgical]] practice in Europe and in South America; in the U.S., no breast implant manufacturer has sought the FDA’s approval for American medical sale.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hester TR Jr, Tebbetts JB, Maxwell GP | title=The Polyurethane-covered Mammary Prosthesis: Facts and Fiction (II): A Look Back and a "peek" Ahead | journal=Clinical Plastic Surgery | year=2001 | pages=579–86 | volume=28 | issue=3 | pmid=11471963}}</ref>

* The third technological development was the '''double lumen''' breast-implant, a double-cavity device composed of a silicone-implant within a saline-implant. The two-fold, technical goal was: (i) the cosmetic benefits of silicone-gel (the inner lumen) enclosed in saline solution (the outer lumen); (ii) a breast-implant device the volume of which is post-operatively adjustable. Nevertheless, the more complex design of the double-lumen breast-implant suffered a device-failure rate greater than that of single-lumen breast implants. The contemporary versions of Second generation devices, presented in 1984, are the “Becker Expandable” models of breast implant device, used primarily for [[Reconstructive surgery|breast reconstruction]].

;Third and Fourth generations
In the 1980s, the models of the Third and of the Fourth generations of breast-implant devices were sequential advances in manufacturing technology, e.g. [[elastomer]]-coated shells that decreased gel-bleed (filler leakage), and a thicker filler (increased-cohesion) gel. [[Sociology of health and illness|Sociologically]], the manufacturers then designed and fabricated varieties of anatomic models (natural breast) and shaped models (round, tapered) that realistically corresponded with the breast and body types presented by women patients. The tapered models of breast implant have a uniformly textured surface, to reduce rotation; the round models of breast implant are available in smooth-surface and textured-surface types.

;Fifth generation
Since the mid-1990s, the Fifth generation of silicone breast implant is made of a semi-solid gel that mostly eliminates filler leakage (silicone gel bleed) and silicone migration from the breast to elsewhere in the body. The studies ''Experience with Anatomical Soft Cohesive Silicone gel Prosthesis in Cosmetic and Reconstructive Breast Implant Surgery'' (2004) and ''Cohesive Silicone gel Breast Implants in Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Surgery'' (2005) reported low incidence rates of [[capsular contracture]] and of device-shell rupture, improved medical safety and technical efficacy greater than earlier generations of breast implant device.<ref name="Brown2005">{{cite journal | author=Brown MH, Shenker R, Silver SA | title=Cohesive Silicone Gel Breast Implants in Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Surgery | journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | year=2005 | pages=768–779 | volume=116 | issue=3 | pmid=16141814 | doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000176259.66948.e7}}</ref><ref name="Fruhstorfer2004">{{cite journal | author=Fruhstorfer BH, Hodgson EL, Malata CM | title=Early Experience with Anatomical Soft Cohesive Silicone gel Prosthesis in Cosmetic and Reconstructive Breast Implant Surgery | journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery | year=2004 | pages=536–542 | volume=53 | issue=6 | pmid=15602249 | doi=10.1097/01.sap.0000134508.43550.6f}}</ref><ref name="Heden2001">{{cite journal | author=Heden P, Jernbeck J, Hober M | title=Breast Augmentation with Anatomical Cohesive gel Implants: The World's Largest Current Experience | journal=Clinical Plastic Surgery | year=2001 | pages=531–52 | volume=28 | issue=3 | pmid=11471959}}</ref>

;Psychology
The [[breast augmentation]] patient usually is a young woman whose personality profile indicates psychological distress about her personal appearance and her body ([[self image]]), and a history of having endured criticism (teasing) about the [[aesthetics]] of her person.<ref name="Brinton2000">{{cite journal | author = Brinton L, Brown S, Colton T, Burich M, Lubin J | title = Characteristics of a Population of Women with Breast Implants Compared with Women Seeking other Types of Plastic Surgery | journal = Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 105 | issue = 3 | pages = 919–927 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10724251 | doi = 10.1097/00006534-200003000-00014}}</ref> The studies ''Body Image Concerns of Breast Augmentation Patients'' (2003) and ''Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Cosmetic Surgery'' (2006) reported that the woman who underwent [[breast augmentation]] surgery also had undergone [[psychotherapy]], suffered low [[self-esteem]], presented frequent occurrences of [[Depression (mood)|psychological depression]], had attempted [[suicide]], and suffered [[body dysmorphia]], a type of mental illness. Post-operative patient surveys about mental health and quality-of-life, reported improved physical health, physical appearance, social life, self-confidence, self-esteem, and satisfactory [[sexual attraction|sexual functioning]]. Furthermore, the women reported long-term satisfaction with their breast implant outcomes; some despite having suffered medical complications that required surgical revision, either corrective or aesthetic.

;Mental health
In 2008, the [[longitudinal study]] ''Excess Mortality from Suicide and other External Causes of Death Among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants'' (2007), reported that women who sought breast implants are almost 3.0 times as likely to commit [[suicide]] as are women who have not sought breast implants. Compared to the standard suicide-rate for women of the general populace, the suicide-rate for women with augmented breasts remained constant until 10-years post-implantation, yet, it increased to 4.5 times greater at the 11-year mark, and so remained until the 19-year mark, when it increased to 6.0 times greater at 20-years post-implantation. Moreover, additional to the suicide-risk, women with breast implants also faced a trebled death-risk from [[alcoholism]] and the abuse of prescription and recreational drugs.<ref name="reuters.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN0836919020070808?feedType=RSS&rpc=22&sp=true | work=Reuters | title=Breast Implants Linked with Suicide in Study | date=2007-08-08}}</ref><ref name="usatoday.com">{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-08-06-breast-implants_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Breast Implants Linked to Higher Suicide Rates | first=Anita | last=Manning | date=2007-08-06 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> Although seven studies have statistically connected a woman’s breast augmentation to a greater suicide-rate, the research indicates that breast augmenation surgery does not increase the death rate; and that, in the first instance, it is the [[psychopathology|psychopathologically]]-inclined woman who is likelier to undergo a [[breast augmentation]] procedure.<ref>Brinton LA et al.

The study ''Effect of Breast Augmentation Mammoplasty on Self-Esteem and Sexuality: A Quantitative Analysis'' (2007), reported that the women attributed their improved [[self image]], [[self-esteem]], and increased, satisfactory sexual functioning to having undergone breast augmentation; the cohort, aged 21–57 years, averaged post-operative self-esteem increases that ranged from 20.7 to 24.9 points on the 30-point [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale]], which data supported the 78.6 per cent increase in the woman’s [[libido]], relative to her pre-operative level of libido.<ref>http://psychcentral.com/news/2007/03/23/plastic-surgery-helps-self-esteem/703.html</ref> Therefore, before agreeing to any surgery, the plastic surgeon evaluates and considers the woman’s [[mental health]] to determine if breast implants can positively affect her self-esteem and [[Sexual attraction|sexual functioning]].

==Surgical procedures==

===Indications===
A [[mammoplasty]] procedure for the emplacement of breast implant devices has three (3) purposes:
# '''primary reconstruction''' — the replacement of breast tissues damaged by trauma ([[blunt trauma|blunt]], [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]], [[blast injury|blast]]), disease ([[breast cancer]]), and failed anatomic development ([[tuberous breast deformity]]).
# '''revision and reconstruction''' — to revise (correct) the outcome of a previous breast reconstruction surgery.
# '''primary augmentation''' — to aesthetically [[Breast augmentation|augment]] the size, form, and feel of the breasts.

The [[operating room]] (OR) time of post–[[mastectomy]] [[breast reconstruction]], and of [[breast augmentation]] surgery is determined by the procedure employed, the type of incisions, the breast implant (type and materials), and the pectoral locale of the implant pocket.

===Incision types===
Breast implant emplacement is performed with five (5) types of surgical incisions:

# '''Inframammary''' — an incision made to the [[infra-mammary fold]] (IMF), which affords maximal access for precise dissection of the tissues and emplacement of the breast implants. It is the preferred surgical technique for emplacing silicone-gel implants, because it better exposes the [[breast|breast tissue]]–[[pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis muscle]] interface; yet, IMF implantation can produce thicker, slightly more visible surgical [[scar]]s.
# '''Periareolar''' — a border-line incision along the periphery of the [[areola]], which provides an optimal approach when adjustments to the IMF position are required, or when a [[mastopexy]] (breast lift) is included to the primary mammoplasty procedure. In periareolar emplacement, the incision is around the medial-half (inferior half) of the areola’s circumference. Silicone gel implants can be difficult to emplace via periareolar incision, because of the short, five-centimetre length (~ 5.0&nbsp;cm) of the required access-incision. Aesthetically, because the scars are at the areola’s border (periphery), they usually are less visible than the IMF-incision scars of women with light-pigment areolae; when compared to cutaneous-incision scars, the modified [[epithelium|epithelia]] of the areolae are less prone to (raised) hypertrophic scars.
# '''Transaxillary''' — an incision made to the [[axilla]] (armpit), from which the dissection tunnels medially, to emplace the implants, either bluntly or with an [[endoscope]] (illuminated video microcamera), without producing visible scars on the breast proper; yet, it is likelier to produce inferior asymmetry of the implant-device position. Therefore, surgical revision of transaxillary emplaced breast implants usually requires either an '''IMF incision''' or a '''periareolar incision'''.
# '''Transumbilical''' — a trans-umbilical breast augmentation ([[Trans-umbilical breast augmentation|TUBA]]) is a less common implant-device emplacement technique wherein the incision is at the umbilicus ([[navel]]), and the dissection tunnels superiorly, up towards the bust. The TUBA approach allows emplacing the breast implants without producing visible scars upon the breast proper; but makes appropriate dissection and device-emplacement more technically difficult. A TUBA procedure is performed bluntly — without the endoscope’s visual assistance — and is not appropriate for emplacing (pre-filled) silicone-gel implants, because of the great potential for damaging the [[elastomer]] [[silicone]] shell of the breast implant during its manual insertion through the short (~2.0&nbsp;cm) incision at the navel, and because pre-filled silicone gel implants are incompressible, and cannot be inserted through so small an incision.<ref name="johnson">{{cite journal | author=Johnson GW, Christ JE.| title=The Endoscopic Breast augmentation: The Transumbilical Insertion of Saline-filled Breast Implants| journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=1993 | pages=801–8 | volume=92 | issue=5 | pmid=8415961}}</ref>
# '''Transabdominal''' — as in the TUBA procedure, in the transabdominoplasty breast augmentation (TABA), the breast implants are tunneled superiorly from the abdominal incision into bluntly dissected implant pockets, whilst the patient simultaneously undergoes an [[abdominoplasty]].<ref name="TABA">{{cite journal | author=Wallach SG.| title=Maximizing the Use of the Abdominoplasty Incision| journal=Plastic Reconstruction Surgery | year=2004 | pages=411–417| volume=113 | issue=1 | pmid=14707667| doi=10.1097/01.PRS.0000091422.11191.1A}}</ref>

===Implant pocket placement===
[[Image:Breast implants.png||thumb|right|185px|Breast implant emplacement: cross-sectional scheme of a subglandular breast prosthesis implantation (1) and of a submuscular breast prosthesis implantation (2).]]

The four (4) [[Plastic surgery|surgical]] approaches to emplacing a breast implant to the implant pocket are described in [[Human anatomy|anatomical]] relation to the [[pectoralis major muscle]].

# '''Subglandular''' — the breast implant is emplaced to the [[retromammary space]], between the [[Mammary gland|breast tissue]] (the gland) and the [[pectoralis major muscle]], which most approximates the plane of normal breast tissue, and affords the most aesthetic results. Yet, in women with thin pectoral soft-tissue, the subglandular position is likelier to show the ripples and wrinkles of the underlying implant. Moreover, the [[capsular contracture]] incidence rate is slightly greater with subglandular implantation.

# '''Subpectoral''' (dual plane) — the breast implant is emplaced beneath the [[pectoralis major muscle]], after the surgeon releases the inferior muscular attachments, with or without partial dissection of the subglandular plane. Resultantly, the upper pole of the implant is partially beneath the pectoralis major muscle, while the lower pole of the implant is in the subglandular plane. This implantation technique achieves maximal coverage of the upper pole of the implant, whilst allowing the expansion of the implant’s lower pole; however, “animation deformity”, the movement of the implants in the subpectoral plane can be excessive for some patients.<ref name="Tebbettsdual">{{cite journal | author=Tebbetts T | title=A System for Breast Implant Selection Based on Patient Tissue Characteristics and Implant-soft tissue Dynamics| journal= Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2002 | pages=1396–1409 | volume=109 | issue=4 | pmid=11964998 | doi=10.1097/00006534-200204010-00030}}</ref>
# '''Submuscular''' — the breast implant is emplaced beneath the [[pectoralis major muscle]], without releasing the inferior origin of the muscle proper. Total muscular coverage of the implant can be achieved by releasing the lateral muscles of the chest wall — either the [[serratus muscle]] or the [[pectoralis minor muscle]], or both — and [[Surgical suture|suturing]] it, or them, to the pectoralis major muscle. In [[breast reconstruction]] surgery, the submuscular implantation approach effects maximal coverage of the breast implants.

===Post-surgical recovery===
The [[Plastic surgery|surgical]] [[scar]]s of a [[breast augmentation]] [[mammoplasty]] develop approximately at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within months. Depending upon the daily-life physical activities required of the woman, the breast augmentation patient usually resumes her normal life at 1-week post-operative. Moreover, women whose breast implants were emplaced beneath the chest muscles (submuscular placement) usually have a longer, slightly more painful convalescence, because of the healing of the incisions to the chest muscles. Usually, she does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for approximately 6 weeks. During the initial post-operative recovery, the woman is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arm to alleviate pain and discomfort; if required, [[analgesic]] indwelling medication catheters can alleviate pain.<ref>Pacik, P.T. “Pain Control in Augmentation Mammaplasty: Safety and Efficacy of Indwelling Catheters in 644 Consecutive Patients” ''Aesthetic Surgery Journal'', 28:279–84, May/June 2008</ref><ref>Pacik, P.T. “Pain Control in Augmentation Mammaplasty Using Indwelling Catheters in 687 Consecutive Patients: Data Analysis”. ''Aesthetic Surgery Journal'', 28:631–41, November/December 2008</ref> Moreover, significantly improved patient recovery has resulted from refined breast-device implantation techniques (submuscular, subglandular) that allow 95 per cent of women to resume their normal lives at 24-hours post-procedure, without bandages, fluid drains, pain pumps, catheters, medical support brassières, or [[narcotic]] pain medication.<ref>Tebbetts JB A System for Breast Implant Selection Based on Patient Tissue Characteristics and Implant-soft tissue Dynamics.

==Complications==
The [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgical]] emplacement of breast-implant devices, either for [[breast reconstruction]] or for [[Plastic surgery|aesthetic purpose]], presents the same health risks common to [[surgery]], such as adverse reaction to [[anesthesia]], [[hematoma]] (post-operative bleeding), [[seroma]] (fluid accumulation), incision-site breakdown (wound infection).  Complications specific to breast augmentation include breast pain, altered sensation, impeded breast-feeding function, visible wrinkling, asymmetry, thinning of the breast tissue, and [[symmastia]], the “bread loafing” of the bust that interrupts the natural plane between the breasts. Specific treatments for the complications of indwelling breast implants — [[capsular contracture]] and capsular rupture — are periodic [[MRI]] monitoring and physical examinations. Furthermore, [[Complications (medical)|complications]] and re-operations related to the implantation surgery, and to [[Tissue expansion|tissue expanders]] (implant place-holders during surgery) can cause unfavorable [[scar]]ring in approximately 6–7 per cent of the patients.

===Capsular contracture===
[[Image:Capsular fibrosis.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Capsular contracture is a breast-implant complication, such as the '''Baker scale Grade IV''' contraction of a subglandular silicone implant in the right breast.]]
{{main|Capsular contracture}}
The human body’s [[immune response]] to a surgically installed foreign object — breast implant, cardiac [[pacemaker]], [[orthopedic]] [[prosthesis]] — is to encapsulate it with [[Scar|scar tissue]] capsules of tightly woven [[collagen]] fibers, in order to maintain the integrity of the body by isolating the foreign object, and so tolerate its presence. [[Capsular contracture]] — which should be distinguished from normal capsular tissue — occurs when the collagen-fiber capsule thickens and compresses the breast implant; it is a painful [[Complication (medical)|complication]] that might distort either the breast implant, or the breast, or both. The cause of capsular contracture is unknown, but the common incidence factors include bacterial contamination, device-shell rupture, filler leakage, and [[hematoma]]. The surgical implantation procedures that have reduced the incidence of capsular contracture include submuscular emplacement, the use of breast implants with a textured surface (polyurethane-coated);<ref name="Barnsley2006">{{cite journal | author=Barnsley GP| title= Textured surface Breast Implants in the Prevention of Capsular Contracture among Breast Augmentation Patients: a Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials | journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2006 | pages=2182–2190| volume=117 | issue=7 | pmid=16772915| doi= 10.1097/01.prs.0000218184.47372.d5 | first2=LJ | first3=SE | last2=Sigurdson | last3=Barnsley}}</ref><ref name="Wong2006">{{cite journal | author=Wong CH, Samuel M, Tan BK, Song C.| title= Capsular Contracture in Subglandular Breast Augmentation with Textured versus Sooth Breast Implants: a Systematic Review| journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2006 | pages=1224–1236| volume=118 | issue=5 | pmid=17016195| doi= 10.1097/01.prs.0000237013.50283.d2}}</ref><ref name="Handel2006">{{cite journal | author=Handel N| title= Long-term safety and efficacy of polyurethane foam-covered breast implants | journal=Journal of Aesthetic Surgery | year=2006 | month=may | pages=265–274| volume=26 | issue=3| doi= 10.1016/j.asj.2006.04.001 | pmid=19338905 | author-separator=, | display-authors=1 | last2=Gutierrez | first2=J}}</ref> limited pre-operative handling of the implants, limited contact with the chest skin of the implant pocket before the emplacement of the breast implant, and irrigation of the recipient site with triple-antibiotic solutions.<ref name="Mladick1993">{{cite journal | author=Mladick RA| title= "No-touch" submuscular saline breast augmentation technique | journal=Journal of Aesthetic Surgery | year=1993 | pages=183–192| volume=17 | issue=3 | pmid= 8213311| doi= 10.1007/BF00636260 }}</ref><ref name="Adams2006">{{cite journal | author=Adams WP jr.| title= Enhancing Patient Outcomes in Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Surgery using Triple Antibiotic Breast Irrigation: Six-year Prospective Clinical Study | journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2006 | pages=30–6 | volume=117 | issue=1 | pmid=16404244 | doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000185671.51993.7e | last2=Rios | first2=Jose L. | last3=Smith | first3=Sharon J. }}</ref>

The correction of capsular contracture might require an open capsulotomy (surgical release) of the collagen-fiber capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, of the breast implant. Furthermore, in treating capsular contracture, the closed capsulotomy (disruption via external manipulation) once was a common maneuver for treating hard capsules, but now is a discouraged technique, because it can rupture the breast implant.

===Repair and revision surgeries===
When the woman is unsatisfied with the outcome of the augmentation mammoplasty; or when technical or medical complications occur; or because of the breast implants’ limited product life ([[Medical device|Class III medical device]], in the U.S.), it is likely she might require replacing the breast implants. The common revision surgery indications include major and minor medical complications, [[capsular contracture]], shell rupture, and device deflation.<ref name = FDA_2004b /> Revision incidence rates were greater for breast reconstruction patients, because of the post-mastectomy changes to the soft-tissues and to the skin envelope of the breast, and to the [[human anatomy|anatomical]] borders of the breast, especially in women who received adjuvant external [[radiation therapy]].<ref name = FDA_2004b /> Moreover, besides breast reconstruction, [[breast cancer]] patients usually undergo revision surgery of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and symmetry procedures upon the opposite breast, to create a bust of natural appearance, size, form, and feel. Carefully matching the type and size of the breast implants to the patient’s pectoral soft-tissue characteristics reduces the incidence of revision surgery. Appropriate tissue matching, implant selection, and proper implantation technique, the re-operation rate was 3.0 per cent at the 7-year-mark, compared with the re-operation rate of 20 per cent at the 3-year-mark, as reported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.<ref name="Tebbets2006">{{cite journal | author= Tebbets JB | title=Out Points Criteria for Breast Implant Removal without Replacement and Criteria to Minimize Reoperations following Breast Augmentation | year=2006 | journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | month= October | volume=114 | issue=5 | pages=1258&ndash;1262 |pmid= 15457046}}</ref><ref name="Tebbets2">{{cite journal | author= Tebbets JB | title=Achieving a Zero Percent Reoperation Rate at 3 years in a 50-consecutive-case Augmentation Mammaplasty Premarket Approval Study | year=2006 | journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | month= December | volume=118 | issue=6 | pages=1453&ndash;7 |pmid= 17051118 | doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000239602.99867.07}}</ref>

In the study ''Long-term Health Status of Danish Women with Silicone Breast Implants'' (2004), the national healthcare system of Denmark reported that women with implants did not risk a greater incidence and diagnosis of [[autoimmune disease]], when compared to same-age women in the general population; that the incidence of musculoskeletal disease was lower among women with breast implants than among women who had undergone other types of cosmetic surgery; and that they had a lower incidence rate than like women in the general population.<ref name="Breiting2004">{{cite journal|author=Breiting VB, Holmich LR, Brandt B, Fryzek JP, Wolthers MS, Kjoller K, McLaughlin JK, Wiik A, Friis S|title=Long-term Health Status of Danish Women with Silicone Breast Implants|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |year=2004|pages=217–226 |volume=114|pmid=15220596|doi=10.1097/01.PRS.0000128823.77637.8A|issue=1}}</ref><ref name="Kjoller2004">{{cite journal | author=Kjoller K, Holmich LR, Fryzek JP, Jacobsen PH, Friis S, McLaughlin JK, Lipworth L, Henriksen TF, Hoier-Madsen M, Wiik A, Olsen JH|title=Self-reported musculoskeletal symptoms among Danish women with cosmetic breast implants|journal= Annals of Plastic Surgery|year=2004|pages=1&ndash;7|volume=52 | pmid= 14676691|doi=10.1097/01.sap.0000101930.75241.55 | issue=1}}</ref>

===Platinum toxicity===
The manufacture of silicone breast implants requires the [[Metal|metallic element]] [[platinum]] as a [[catalyst]] to accelerate the transformation of [[silicone oil]] into silicone gel for making the [[elastomer]] silicone shells, and for making other medical-silicone devices.<ref name="RinzlerCarol">Rinzler, Carol Ann (2009) ''The encyclopedia of Cosmetic and Plastic Surgery'' New York:Facts on File, p.23.</ref> The literature indicates that trace quantities of platinum leak from such types of silicone breast implant; therefore, platinum is present in the surrounding pectoral tissue(s). The rare pathogenic consequence is an accumulation of platinum in the [[bone marrow]], from where blood cells might deliver it to [[nerve|nerve endings]], thus causing [[nervous system]] disorders such as blindness, deafness, and [[tic|nervous tics]] (involuntary muscle contractions).<ref name="RinzlerCarol" /> In 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviewed the studies on the human biological effects of breast-implant platinum, and reported little causal evidence of platinum toxicity to women with breast implants.<ref name="arepelli2003">{{cite journal | author=Arepelli S | title=Allergic reactions to platinum in silicone breast implants | journal=J Long-Term Effects Medical Implants | year=2002 | pages=299–306 | pmid=12627791 | volume=12 | issue=4 | author-separator=, | display-authors=1 | last2=Bezabeh | first2=S | last3=Brown | first3=SL }}</ref> Furthermore, in the journal ''[[Analytical Chemistry]]'', the study ''Total Platinum Concentration and Platinum Oxidation States in Body Fluids, Tissue, and Explants from Women Exposed to Silicone and Saline Breast Implants by IC-ICPMS'' (2006), proved controversial for claiming to have identified previously undocumented toxic platinum oxidative states ''in vivo''.<ref name="AnalChem2006-Lykissa">{{cite journal | author = Lykissa E.D. and Maharaj S.V.M. | year = 2006 | month = April | title = Total Platinum Concentration and Platinum Oxidation States in Body Fluids, Tissue, and Explants from Women Exposed to Silicone and Saline Breast Implants by IC-ICPMS | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 78| issue = 9| pages = 2925–2933| id =(due publication May 2006) | url =http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/ancham/asap/abs/ac0514016.html | accessdate =2006-04-06 | doi = 10.1021/ac0514016 | pmid = 16642977}}</ref> Later, in a letter to the readers, the editors of ''Analytical Chemistry'' published their concerns about the faulty [[Experiment|experimental design]] of the study, and warned readers to “use caution in evaluating the conclusions drawn in the paper.”<ref>{{cite web| url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/84/i31/8431notw5.html |title=Dubious Breast Implant Study: Doubts now surround study claiming to have found high levels of platinum in women with silicone breast|date=July 31, 2006}}</ref> Furthermore, after reviewing the research data of the study, and other pertinent literature, the U.S. FDA reported that the data do not support the findings presented; that the platinum used, in new-model breast-implant devices, likely is not [[Ionization|ionized]], and therefore is not a significant risk to the health of the women.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/platinum.html| title=FDA Backgrounder on Platinum in Silicone Breast Implants| publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref>

==Implants and breast-feeding==
[[File:Breastfeeding01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|'''The functional breast:''' a mammary gland ''in medias res'', feeding an infant.]]

;The functional breast
The [[breasts]] are [[Apocrine|apocrine glands]] that produce [[milk]] for the feeding of infant children; each breast has a [[nipple]] within an [[areola]] (nipple-areola complex, NAC), the skin color of which varies from pink to dark brown, and has [[sebaceous gland]]s. Within the [[mammary gland]], the [[lactiferous duct]]s produce [[Human breast milk|breast milk]], and are distributed throughout the breast, with two-thirds of the tissue within 30-mm of the base of the nipple. In each breast, 4–18 lactiferous ducts drain to the nipple; the glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in [[Lactation|lactating]] women, and to 1:1 in non-lactating women; besides milk glands, the breast is composed of [[connective tissue]] ([[collagen]], [[elastin]]), [[adipose tissue]] (white fat), and the suspensory [[Cooper's ligaments]]. The [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nervous system innervation]] of the breast is by the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth intercostal [[nerve]]s, while the [[Thoracic spinal nerve 4]] (T4) innervating the [[dermatomic area]] supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.<ref name="Tortora, Gerard J.">Introduction to the Human Body, Fifth Edition.

Digestive contamination and systemic toxicity are the principal infant-health concerns; the leakage of breast implant filler to the [[Human breast milk|breast milk]], and if the filler is dangerous to the nursing infant. Breast implant device fillers are biologically inert — [[saline (medicine)|saline filler]] is salt water, and [[silicone|silicone filler]] is [[Digestion|indigestible]] — because each substance is chemically inert, and environmentally common. Moreover, proponent physicians have said there “should be no absolute contraindication to breast-feeding by women with silicone breast implants.”<ref>Berlin, C. M. Silicone Breast Implants and Breast-feeding. Pediatrics 1994; 94:546–549.</ref><ref name="berlin1996">[http://www.llli.org/ba/Feb96.html Silicone Breast Implants and Breastfeeding], Cheston M. Berlin, Jr. MD, Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania; from Breastfeeding Abstracts. February 1996, Volume 15, Number 3, pp. 17–18.</ref> In the early 1990s, at the beginning of the silicone breast-implant sickness occurrences, small-scale, non-random studies (i.e. “patients came with complaints, which might have many sources”, not “doctors performed random tests”) indicated possible breast-feeding complications from silicone implants; yet no study reported device–disease causality.<ref name="berlin1996" />

;The augmented breast
Women with breast implants are able to breast-feed; however implant devices may cause functional breast-feeding difficulties, especially the [[mammoplasty]] procedures that feature periareolar incisions and subglandular emplacement, which have greater incidences of breast-feeding difficulties. Surgery may also damage the [[lactiferous duct]]s and the nerves of the nipple-areola complex (NAC).<ref>[http://www.llli.org/NB/NBsurgery.html Breastfeeding after Breast Surgery], La Leche League, contains references.</ref><ref>[http://www.llli.org/cbi/bibimplant.html Breastfeeding and Breast Implants], Selected Bibliography April 2003, LLLI Center for Breastfeeding Information</ref><ref name="slate">[http://www.slate.com/id/2238096/ Inorganic Milk: Can Kendra Wilkinson breast-feed her baby even though she has implants?], Christopher Beam, [[Slate.com]], 11 December 2009</ref> 

Functional breast-feeding difficulties arise if the surgeon cut the [[lactiferous duct|milk ducts]] or the major nerves innervating the breast, or if the milk glands were otherwise damaged. Milk duct and nerve damage are more common to the periareolar incision implantation procedure, which cuts tissue near the nipple, whereas other implantation incision-plans — IMF (Inframammary Fold), TABA (Trans-Axillary Breast Augmentation), TUBA ([[Trans-umbilical breast augmentation|Trans-Umbilical Breast Augmentation]]) — avoid the tissue of the nipple-areola complex; if the woman is concerned about possible breast-feeding difficulties, the periareolar incisions can be effected to reduce damage to the milk ducts and to the nerves of the NAC. The milk glands are affected most by subglandular implants (under the gland), and by large-sized breast implants, which pinch the lactiferous ducts and impede milk flow. Small-sized breast implants, and submuscular implantation, cause fewer breast-function problems; however, women have successfully breast-fed after undergoing periareolar incisions and subglandular emplacement.<ref name="slate"/>

==Implants and mammography==
[[Image:Mammo breast cancer.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Breast implant: Mammographs:<br> Normal breast (left) and cancerous breast (right).]]

The presence of [[radiology|radiologically]] opaque breast implants might interfere with the radiographic sensitivity of the [[mammograph]]. In this case, an Eklund view mammogram is required, wherein the breast implant is manually displaced against the chest wall and the breast is pulled forward, so that the mammograph can visualize the internal tissues; nonetheless, approximately one-third of the breast tissue remains inadequately visualized, resulting in an increased incidence of false-negative mammograms.<ref name="Handel1992">{{cite journal | author=Handel, N., Silverstein, M.

==U.S. FDA approval==
[[File:Food and Drug Administration logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|Breast implant: the Food and Drug Administration, the [[medical device]] authority for the U.S.]]
In 1988, twenty-six years after the 1962 introduction of breast implants filled with silicone gel, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) investigated breast-implant failures and the subsequent [[Complications (medical)|complications]], and re-classified breast implant devices as Class III medical devices, and required from manufacturers the documentary data substantiating the safety and efficacy of their breast implant devices.<ref name="FDABICH">[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/indexbip.html FDA Breast Implant Consumer Handbook - 2004]</ref> In 1992, the FDA placed silicone-gel breast implants in moratorium in the U.S., because there was “inadequate information to demonstrate that breast implants were safe and effective”. Nonetheless, medical access to silicone-gel breast implant devices continued for clinical studies of post-mastectomy [[breast reconstruction]], the correction of congenital deformities, and the replacement of ruptured silicone-gel implants. The FDA required from the manufacturers the clinical trial data, and permitted their providing breast implants to the [[breast augmentation]] patients for the statistical studies required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.<ref name="FDABICH" /> In mid–1992, the FDA approved an adjunct study protocol for silicone-gel filled implants for breast reconstruction patients, and for revision-surgery patients. Also in 1992, the [[Dow Corning Corporation]], a silicone products and breast-implant manufacturer, announced the discontinuation of five implant-grade [[silicone]]s, but would continue producing 45 other, medical-grade, silicone materials—three years later, in 1995, the Dow Corning Corporation went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] when it faced 19,000 breast-implant sickness lawsuits.<ref name="FDABICH" />

* In 1997, the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) appointed the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) to investigate the potential risks of operative and post-operative [[Complication (medical)|complications]] from the emplacement of silicone breast implants. The IOM’s review of the safety and efficacy of silicone gel-filled breast implants, reported that the “evidence suggests diseases or conditions, such as [[Cartilage|connective tissue]] diseases, [[cancer]], neurological diseases, or other systemic complaints or conditions are no more common in women with breast implants, than in women without implants”; subsequent studies and systemic review found no causal link between silicone breast implants and disease.<ref name="FDABICH" />
[[File:US-DeptOfHHS-Seal.svg|thumb|right|200px|Breast implant: the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services verifies the scientific, medical, and clinical data of medical devices.]]
* In 1998, the U.S. FDA approved adjunct study protocols for silicone-gel filled implants only for breast reconstruction patients and for revision-surgery patients; and also approved the Dow Corning Corporation’s Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study for silicone-gel breast implants for a limited number of breast augmentation-, reconstruction-, and revision-surgery patients.<ref name="FDABICH" />

* In 1999, the Institute of Medicine published the ''Safety of Silicone Breast Implants'' (1999) study that reported no evidence that saline-filled and silicone-gel filled breast implant devices caused systemic health problems; that their use posed no new health or safety risks; and that local complications are “the primary safety issue with silicone breast implants”, in distinguishing among routine and local medical complications and systemic health concerns.”<ref name="FDABICH" /><ref>[http://books.nap.edu/catalog/9602.html NAP report]</ref><ref>[http://books.nap.edu/catalog/9618.html NAP consumer report]</ref>

* In 2000, the FDA approved saline breast implant Premarket Approval Applications (PMA) containing the type and rate data of the local medical complications experienced by the breast surgery patients.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/NEW00727.html FDA study] {{Wayback |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/NEW00727.html |date=20080113143409 |bot=H3llBot}}</ref> “Despite complications experienced by some women, the majority of those women still in the [[Inamed Corporation]] and [[Mentor Corporation]] studies, after three years, reported being satisfied with their implants.”<ref name="FDABICH" /> The premarket approvals were granted for breast augmentation, for women at least 18 years old, and for women requiring [[breast reconstruction]].<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf/p990075.html FDA approval]</ref><ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf/p990074.html FDA approval]</ref>

* In 2006, for the Inamed Corporation and for the Mentor Corporation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lifted its restrictions against using silicone-gel breast implants for breast reconstruction and for augmentation mammoplasty. Yet, the approval was conditional upon accepting FDA monitoring, the completion of 10-year-mark studies of the women who already had the breast implants, and the completion of a second, 10-year-mark study of the safety of the breast implants in 40,000 other women.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01512.html |title=FDA Approves Silicone Gel-Filled Breast Implants |accessdate=2008-07-01 |publisher=FDA }}</ref> The FDA warned the public that breast implants do carry medical risks, and recommended that women who undergo [[breast augmentation]] should periodically undergo [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] examinations to screen for signs of either shell rupture or of filler leakage, or both conditions; and ordered that breast surgery patients be provided with detailed, informational brochures explaining the medical risks of using silicone-gel breast implants.<ref name="FDABICH" />

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration established the age ranges for women seeking breast implants; for breast reconstruction, silicone-gel filled implants and saline-filled implants were approved for women of all ages; for breast augmentation, saline implants were approved for women 18 years of age and older; silicone implants were approved for women 22 years of age and older. [http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm063719.htm#4]. Because each breast implant device entails different medical risks, the minimum age of the patient for saline breast implants is different from the minimum age of the patient for silicone breast implants — because of the filler leakage and silent shell-rupture risks; thus, periodic [[MRI]] screening examinations are the recommended post-operative, follow-up therapy for the patient. [http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm063719.htm#5] In other countries, in Europe and Oceania, the national health ministries’ breast-implant policies do not endorse periodic MRI screening of asymptomatic patients, but suggest palpation proper — with or without an [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] screening — to be sufficient post-operative therapy for most patients.

==Criticism==
In the early 1990s, the national health ministries of the listed countries reviewed the pertinent studies for causal links among silicone-gel breast implants and systemic and auto-immune diseases. The collective conclusion is that there is no evidence establishing a causal connection between the implantation of silicone breast implants and either type of disease. The affected women complained of systemic disease manifested as [[fungus|fungal]], [[neurology|neurologic]], and [[rheumatology|rheumatologic]] ailments. The Danish study ''Long-term Health Status of Danish Women with Silicone Breast Implants'' (2004) reported that women who had breast implants for an average of 19 years were no more likely to report an excessive number of [[rheumatic disease]] symptoms than would the women of the control group.<ref name="Breiting2004" /> The follow-up study ''Mortality Rates Among Augmentation Mammoplasty Patients: An Update'' (2006) reported a decreased [[standardized mortality ratio]] and an increased risk of [[lung cancer]] death among breast-implant patients, than among patients for other types of plastic surgery; the mortality rate differences were attributed to [[tobacco smoking]].<ref name="Brinton2006">{{cite journal | author=Brinton LA, Lubin JH, Murray MC, Colton T, Hoover RN | title=Mortality Rates Among Augmentation Mammoplasty Patients: An Update | journal=Epidemiology | year=2006 | pages=162&ndash;9 | volume=17 | issue=2 | pmid=16477256 | doi=10.1097/01.ede.0000197056.84629.19}}</ref> The study ''Mortality Among Canadian Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants'' (2006), about some 25,000 women with breast implants, reported a 43 per cent lower rate of breast cancer among them than among the general populace, and a lower-than-average risk of cancer.<ref name="Villenueve2006">{{cite journal | author=Villenueve PJ | title=Mortality Among Canadian Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants | journal=American Journal of Epidemiology | year=2006 | month=June| pmid=16777929 | doi=10.1093/aje/kwj214 | volume=164 | pages=334–341 | issue=4 | author-separator=, | display-authors=1 | last2=Holowaty | first2=EJ | last3=Brisson | first3=J | last4=Xie | first4=L | last5=Ugnat | first5=AM | last6=Latulippe | first6=L | last7=Mao | first7=Y }}</ref>
