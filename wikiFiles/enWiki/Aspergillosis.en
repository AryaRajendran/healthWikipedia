'''Aspergillosis''' is the name given to a wide variety of diseases caused by infection by [[fungi]] of the genus ''[[Aspergillus]]''. The most common forms are [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]], pulmonary [[aspergilloma]], and invasive aspergillosis. Most humans inhale ''Aspergillus'' [[spore]]s every day. Aspergillosis develops mainly in individuals who are [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]], either from disease or from immunosuppressive drugs, and is a leading cause of death in acute leukemia and [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]]. The most common cause is ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]''.

== Symptoms ==
A [[aspergilloma|fungus ball]] in the lungs may cause no symptoms and may be discovered only with a chest X-ray, or it may cause repeated coughing up of blood and occasionally severe, even fatal, bleeding. A rapidly invasive ''Aspergillus'' infection in the lungs often causes cough, fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing.

Aspergillosis affecting the deeper tissues makes a person very ill. Symptoms include fever, chills, shock, delirium, and blood clots. The person may develop [[kidney failure]], [[liver failure]] (causing [[jaundice]]), and breathing difficulties. Death can occur quickly.

Aspergillosis of the ear canal causes itching and occasionally pain. Fluid draining overnight from the ear may leave a stain on the pillow. Aspergillosis of the sinuses causes a feeling of congestion and sometimes pain or discharge.

In addition to the symptoms, an [[X-ray]] or [[computerised tomography]] (CT) scan of the infected area provides clues for making the diagnosis. Whenever possible, a doctor sends a sample of infected material to a laboratory to confirm identification of the fungus.

==Diagnosis==
On [[chest X-ray]] and CT, pulmonary aspergillosis classically manifests as a [[halo sign]], and, later, an [[air crescent sign]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1148/133.1.17 | author = Curtis A, Smith G, Ravin C | title = Air crescent sign of invasive aspergillosis. | journal = Radiology | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–21 | date=1 October 1979| pmid = 472287 | url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/abstract/133/1/17?ijkey=657da61e6546d66bd27550542bc4d25be2efe638&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha }}</ref>
In hematologic patients with invasive aspergillosis, the [[galactomannan]] test can make the diagnosis in a noninvasive way.

On [[microscopy]], ''Aspergillus'' species are reliably demonstrated by [[silver stain]]s, e.g., [[Gridley stain]] or [[Gomori methenamine-silver]].<ref name=kradin>{{cite journal |author=Kradin RL, Mark EJ |title=The pathology of pulmonary disorders due to Aspergillus spp |journal=Arch.

== Treatment ==
Several experimental animal models have tested curcumin ([[turmeric]]) on lung fibrosis and these studies demonstrate that curcumin attenuates (lessens) lung injury and fibrosis caused by radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and toxicants. The growing amount of data from pharmacological and animal studies also supports the notion that curcumin plays a protective role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and allergic asthma, its therapeutic action being on the prevention or modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress. 

The current treatments include [[voriconazole]] and [[liposomal amphotericin B]]. Newer findings suggest the use of mild oral steroids for a longer period of time, preferably for 6-9 months in aspergillosis of the lungs. 

Other drugs used, such as [[amphotericin B]], [[caspofungin]] (in combination therapy only), [[flucytosine]] (in combination therapy only), or [[itraconazole]],<!--and posaconazole

==Infections in animals==
Albeit relatively rare in humans, aspergillosis is a common and dangerous infection in [[birds]], particularly in pet [[parrots]].  [[Mallard]]s and other ducks are particularly susceptible, as they will often resort to poor food sources during bad weather. Captive raptors, such as falcons and hawks, are susceptible to this disease if they are kept in poor conditions and especially if they are fed pigeons, which are often carriers of "asper".

Aspergillosis has been the culprit in several recent rapid die-offs among waterfowl.  From 8 December until 14 December 2006, over 2,000 Mallards died in the [[Burley, Idaho]] area, an agricultural community approximately 150 miles southeast of [[Boise]].  Moldy waste grain from the farmland and feedlots in the area is the suspected source.  A similar aspergillosis outbreak caused by moldy grain killed 500 Mallards in [[Iowa]] in 2005.  

While there is no connection between aspergillosis and the H5N1 strain of [[avian influenza]] (commonly called "bird flu"), rapid die-offs caused by aspergillosis can spark fears of bird flu outbreaks.  Laboratory analysis is the only way to distinguish bird flu from aspergillosis.
