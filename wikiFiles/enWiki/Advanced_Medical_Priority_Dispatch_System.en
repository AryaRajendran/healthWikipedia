The '''Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System''' (AMPDS), is an [[Emergency medical dispatch|Emergency Medical Dispatch]] (EMD) system developed and marketed by Priority Dispatch Corporation. AMPDS is primarily used in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], where it is medically approved. The developer has similar products for police and fire.

AMPDS provides a unified system used to dispatch appropriate aid to medical emergencies, It includes systematized caller interrogation and pre-arrival instructions. The caller responses are used as inputs to gain a main response output category - '''A''' (Immediately Life Threatening), '''B''' (Urgent Call), or '''C''' (Routine Call).  This can link to a performance targeting system such as [[Operational Research CONsultancy|ORCON]] to match call metrics to their targets, such as category response time.  For example, in the United Kingdom, calls rated as 'A' on AMPDS have an 8 minute responder-on-scene target.

Each call is also assigned a sub-category or code, often used as a means of gathering further [[statistics]] about performance.  It also helps when analysing the calls for how the call was described by the informant, compared to the [[injury]] or [[illness]] found when the crew attend.  This can then be used to help improve the questioning system which gives the AMPDS classification. Each category is numbered alphabetically from 1 (abdominal pain) through 32 (unknown). This is usually used for brevity and privacy over the radio. In some areas instead of the A, B, C categories, A (alpha) through E (echo) are used.
