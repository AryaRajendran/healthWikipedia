RCT are often used to test the [[Efficacy#Medicine|efficacy]] and/or [[effectiveness]] of various types of medical [[Health intervention|intervention]] within a patient [[statistical population|population]]. RCT may also provide an opportunity to gather useful information about adverse effects, such as [[adverse drug reactions|drug reactions]]. 

The key distinguishing feature of the usual RCT is that study subjects, after assessment of eligibility and recruitment, but before the intervention to be studied begins, are randomly allocated to receive one or other of the alternative treatments under study. Random allocation in real trials is complex, but conceptually, the process is like tossing a coin. After randomization, the two (or more) groups of subjects are followed in exactly the same way, and the only differences between the care they receive, for example, in terms of procedures, tests, outpatient visits, follow-up calls etc. should be those intrinsic to the treatments being compared.  The most important advantage of proper randomization is that it minimizes allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments."<ref name="Moher-2010">{{Cite journal | author = Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG | title = CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials | journal = [[Br Med J]] | volume = 340 | pages = c869 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c869 | pmid = 20332511 | pmc = 2844943 }}</ref>

Ronald A. Fisher was "interested in application and in the popularization
of statistical methods and his early book ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]'', published in 1925, went through many editions and
motivated and influenced the practical use of statistics in many fields of

emphasized examples and how&nbsp;to&nbsp;design experiments systematically from
a statistical point of view. The mathematical justification of the methods
described was not stressed and, indeed, proofs were often barely sketched

==Classifications of RCTs==

===By study design===
One way to classify RCTs is by [[study design]].  From most to least common in the medical literature, the major categories of RCT study designs are:<ref name="Hopewell-2010">{{Cite journal | author = Hopewell S, Dutton S, Yu LM, Chan AW, Altman DG | title = The quality of reports of randomised trials in 2000 and 2006: comparative study of articles indexed in PubMed | journal = BMJ | volume = 340 | pages = c723 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/mar23_1/c723 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c723  | pmid = 20332510 | pmc = 2844941 }}</ref>
* [[Parallel study|Parallel-group]] – each participant is randomly assigned to a group, and all the participants in the group receive (or do not receive) an intervention.
* [[Crossover study|Crossover]] – over time, each participant receives (or does not receive) an intervention in a random sequence.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Jones | first = Byron | coauthors = Kenward, Michael G. | title = Design and Analysis of Cross-Over Trials | edition=Second| publisher = London: Chapman and Hall | year = 2003 }}</ref><ref>
{{cite book  | last = Vonesh | first = Edward F. | coauthors = Chinchilli, Vernon G. | chapter=Crossover Experiments| pages=111–202|title = [[Linear model|Linear]] and [[Nonlinear regression|Nonlinear]] [[Statistical model|Models]] for the [[Statistical inference|Analysis]] of [[Repeated measures design|Repeated Measurements]] | publisher = London: Chapman and Hall | year = 1997 }}</ref>
* [[Cluster randomised controlled trial|Cluster]] – pre-existing groups of participants (e.g., villages, schools) are randomly selected to receive (or not receive) an intervention.
* [[Factorial experiment|Factorial]] – each participant is randomly assigned to a group that receives a particular combination of interventions or non-interventions (e.g., group 1 receives vitamin X and vitamin Y, group 2 receives vitamin X and placebo Y, group 3 receives placebo X and vitamin Y, and group 4 receives placebo X and placebo Y).
An analysis of the 616 RCTs indexed in [[PubMed]] during December 2006 found that 78% were parallel-group trials, 16% were crossover, 2% were split-body, 2% were cluster, and 2% were factorial.<ref name="Hopewell-2010"/>

===By outcome of interest (efficacy vs. effectiveness)===
RCTs can be classified as "explanatory" or "pragmatic."<ref name="Zwarenstein-2008">{{Cite journal | author = Zwarenstein M, Treweek S, Gagnier JJ, Altman DG, Tunis S, Haynes B, Oxman AD, Moher D; CONSORT group; Pragmatic Trials in Healthcare (Practihc) group | title = Improving the reporting of pragmatic trials: an extension of the CONSORT statement | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | pages = a2390 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a2390 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/nov11_2/a2390 | pmid = 19001484 }}</ref> Explanatory RCTs test [[Efficacy#Medicine|efficacy]] in a research setting with highly selected participants and under highly controlled conditions.<ref name="Zwarenstein-2008"/> In contrast, pragmatic RCTs test [[Effectiveness#Usage|effectiveness]] in everyday practice with relatively unselected participants and under flexible conditions; in this way, pragmatic RCTs can "inform decisions about practice."<ref name="Zwarenstein-2008"/>

===By hypothesis (superiority vs. noninferiority vs. equivalence)===
Another classification of RCTs categorizes them as "superiority trials," "noninferiority trials," and "equivalence trials," which differ in methodology and reporting.<ref name="Piaggio-2006">{{Cite journal | author = Piaggio G, Elbourne DR, [[Doug Altman|Altman DG]], [[Stuart Pocock|Pocock SJ]], Evans SJ; CONSORT Group | title = Reporting of noninferiority and equivalence randomized trials: an extension of the CONSORT statement | journal = JAMA | volume = 295 | issue = 10 | pages = 1152–60 |  year = 2006 | doi = 10.1001/jama.295.10.1152 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/10/1152 | pmid = 16522836 }}</ref> Most RCTs are superiority trials, in which one intervention is hypothesized to be superior to another in a [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] way.<ref name="Piaggio-2006"/> Some RCTs are noninferiority trials "to determine whether a new treatment is no worse than a reference treatment."<ref name="Piaggio-2006"/> Other RCTs are equivalence trials in which the hypothesis is that two interventions are indistinguishable from each other.<ref name="Piaggio-2006"/>

== Randomization ==
The advantages of proper [[randomization]] in RCTs include:<ref name="Schulz-2002">{{Cite journal | author = Schulz KF, Grimes DA | title = Generation of allocation sequences in randomised trials: chance, not choice | journal = Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9305 | pages = 515–9 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07683-3 | url = http://www.who.int/entity/rhl/LANCET_515-519.pdf | pmid = 11853818 }}</ref>
* "It eliminates bias in treatment assignment," specifically [[selection bias]] and [[confounding]].
* "It facilitates blinding (masking) of the identity of treatments from investigators, participants, and assessors."
* "It permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood that any difference in outcome between treatment groups merely indicates chance."

There are two processes involved in randomizing patients to different interventions. First is choosing a ''randomization procedure'' to generate an unpredictable sequence of allocations; this may be a simple random assignment of patients to any of the groups at equal probabilities, may be "restricted," or may be "adaptive." A second and more practical issue is ''allocation concealment'', which refers to the stringent precautions taken to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups. Non-random "systematic" methods of group assignment, such as alternating subjects between one group and the other, can cause "limitless contamination possibilities" and can cause a breach of allocation concealment.<ref name="Schulz-2002"/>

=== Randomization procedures ===
The treatment allocation is the desired proportion of patients in each treatment arm.  

An ideal randomization procedure would achieve the following goals:<ref name="Lachin-1988a">{{Cite journal | author = Lachin JM | title = Statistical properties of randomization in clinical trials | journal = Control Clin Trials | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 289–311 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3060315 |  doi = 10.1016/0197-2456(88)90045-1 }}</ref>
* '''Maximize [[statistical power]]''', especially in [[Subgroup analysis|subgroup analyses]].  Generally, equal group sizes maximize statistical power, however, unequal groups sizes maybe more powerful for some analyses (e.g., multiple comparisons of placebo versus several doses using Dunnett’s procedure<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenberger|first=James|title=STAT 503 - Design of Experiments|url=https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat503/node/16|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=24 September 2012}}</ref> ), and are sometimes desired for non-analytic reasons (e.g., patients maybe more motivated to enroll if there is a higher chance of getting the test treatment, or regulatory agencies may require a minimun number of patients exposed to treatment).<ref name="Avins-1998">{{cite journal|last=Avins|first="A L"|title="Can unequal be more fair? Ethics, subject allocation, and randomized clinical trials".|journal=J Med Ethics|year=1998|volume=24|pages=401–408|doi=10.1136/jme.24.6.401|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/24/6/401}}</ref>
* '''Minimize selection bias'''.  This may occur if investigators can consciously or unconsciously preferentially enroll patients between treatment arms.  A good randomization procedure will be unpredictable so that investigators cannot guess the next subject's group assignment based on prior treatment assignments. The risk of selection bias is highest when previous treatment assignments are known (as in unblinded studies) or can be guessed (perhaps if a drug has distinctive side effects).
* '''Minimize allocation bias''' (or '''confounding''').  This may occur when [[covariate]]s that affect the outcome are not equally distributed between treatment groups, and the treatment effect is confounded with the effect of the covariates (i.e., an "accidental bias"<ref name="Schulz-2002"/><ref name="Buyse-1989">{{Cite journal | author = Buyse ME | title = Analysis of clinical trial outcomes: some comments on subgroup analyses | journal = Control Clin Trials | volume = 10 | issue = 4 Suppl | pages = 187S–194S | year = 1989 | pmid = 2605967 |  doi = 10.1016/0197-2456(89)90057-3 }}</ref>).  If the randomization procedure causes an imbalance in covariates related to the outcome across groups, estimates of effect may be [[bias of an estimator|biased]] if not adjusted for the covariates (which may be unmeasured and therefore impossible to adjust for).

However, no single randomization procedure meets those goals in every circumstance, so researchers must select a procedure for a given study based on its advantages and disadvantages.

==== Simple randomization ====
This is a commonly used and intuitive procedure, similar to "repeated fair coin-tossing."<ref name="Schulz-2002"/> Also known as "complete" or "unrestricted" randomization, it is [[Robust statistics|robust]] against both selection and accidental biases. However, its main drawback is the possibility of imbalanced group sizes in small RCTs.  It is therefore recommended only for RCTs with over 200 subjects.<ref name="Lachin-1988b">{{Cite journal | author = Lachin JM, Matts JP, Wei LJ | title = Randomization in clinical trials: conclusions and recommendations | journal = Control Clin Trials | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 365–74 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3203526 |  doi = 10.1016/0197-2456(88)90049-9 }}</ref>

==== Restricted randomization ====
To balance group sizes in smaller RCTs, some form of [[restricted randomization|"restricted" randomization]] is recommended.<ref name="Lachin-1988b"/>  The major types of restricted randomization used in RCTs are:
* '''[[Randomized block design|Permuted-block randomization]]''' or '''blocked randomization''': a "block size" and "allocation ratio" (number of subjects in one group versus the other group) are specified, and subjects are allocated randomly within each block.<ref name="Schulz-2002"/> For example, a block size of 6 and an allocation ratio of 2:1 would lead to random assignment of 4 subjects to one group and 2 to the other. This type of randomization can be combined with "stratified randomization", for example by center in a [[multicenter trial]], to "ensure good balance of participant characteristics in each group."<ref name="Moher-2010"/> A special case of permuted-block randomization is ''random allocation'', in which the entire sample is treated as one block.<ref name="Schulz-2002"/> The major disadvantage of permuted-block randomization is that even if the block sizes are large and randomly varied, the procedure can lead to selection bias.<ref name="Lachin-1988a"/> Another disadvantage is that "proper" analysis of data from permuted-block-randomized RCTs requires stratification by blocks.<ref name="Lachin-1988b"/>
* '''Adaptive biased-coin randomization''' methods (of which '''urn randomization''' is the most widely known type): In these relatively uncommon methods, the probability of being assigned to a group decreases if the group is overrepresented and increases if the group is underrepresented.<ref name="Schulz-2002"/> The methods are thought to be less affected by selection bias than permuted-block randomization.<ref name="Lachin-1988b"/>

==== Adaptive ====
At least two types of "adaptive" randomization procedures have been used in RCTs, but much less frequently than simple or restricted randomization:
* '''Covariate-adaptive randomization''', of which one type is '''[[Minimisation (clinical trials)|minimization]]''': The probability of being assigned to a group varies in order to minimize "covariate imbalance."<ref name="Lachin-1988b"/> Minimization is reported to have "supporters and detractors";<ref name="Schulz-2002"/> because only the first subject's group assignment is truly chosen at random, the method does not necessarily eliminate bias on unknown factors.<ref name="Moher-2010"/>
* '''Response-adaptive randomization''', also known as '''outcome-adaptive randomization''': The probability of being assigned to a group increases if the responses of the prior patients in the group were favorable.<ref name="Lachin-1988b"/> Although arguments have been made that this approach is more ethical than other types of randomization when the probability that a treatment is effective or ineffective increases during the course of an RCT, ethicists have not yet studied the approach in detail.<ref name="Rosenberger-1993">{{Cite journal | author = Rosenberger WF, Lachin JM | title = The use of response-adaptive designs in clinical trials | journal = Control Clin Trials | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 471–84 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8119063 |  doi = 10.1016/0197-2456(93)90028-C }}</ref>

=== Allocation concealment ===
"Allocation concealment" (defined as "the procedure for protecting the randomisation process so that the treatment to be allocated is not known before the patient is entered into the study") is important in RCTs.<ref name="Forder-2005">{{Cite journal | author = Forder PM, Gebski VJ, Keech AC | title = Allocation concealment and blinding: when ignorance is bliss | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 182 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–9 | year = 2005 | url = http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/182_02_170105/for10877_fm.html | pmid = 15651970 }}</ref> In practice, in taking care of individual patients, clinical investigators in RCTs often find it difficult to maintain impartiality. Stories abound of investigators holding up sealed envelopes to lights or ransacking offices to determine group assignments in order to dictate the assignment of their next patient.<ref name="Schulz-2002">{{Cite journal | title = Allocation concealment in randomised trials: defending against deciphering | journal = Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9306 | pages = 614–8 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07750-4 | url = http://www.who.int/entity/rhl/LANCET_614-618.pdf | pmid = 11867132 | author = Schulz KF, Grimes DA }}</ref> Such practices introduce selection bias and [[Lurking variable|confounders]] (both of which should be minimized by randomization), thereby possibly distorting the results of the study.<ref name="Schulz-2002"/> Adequate allocation concealment should defeat patients and investigators from discovering treatment allocation once a study is underway and after the study has concluded.  Treatment related side-effects or adverse events may be specific enough to reveal allocation to investigators or patients thereby introducing bias or influencing any subjective parameters collected by investigators or requested from subjects.

Some standard methods of ensuring allocation concealment include sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE); sequentially numbered containers; pharmacy controlled randomization; and central randomization.<ref name="Schulz-2002"/> It is recommended that allocation concealment methods be included in an RCT's [[Clinical trial protocol|protocol]], and that the allocation concealment methods should be reported in detail in a publication of an RCT's results; however, 2005 study determined that most RCTs have unclear allocation concealment in their protocols, in their publications, or both.<ref name="Pildal-2005">{{Cite journal | author = Pildal J, Chan AW, Hróbjartsson A, Forfang E, Altman DG, Gøtzsche PC | title = Comparison of descriptions of allocation concealment in trial protocols and the published reports: cohort study | journal = BMJ | volume = 330 | issue = 7499 | page = 1049 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38414.422650.8F | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7499/1049 | pmid = 15817527 | pmc = 557221 }}</ref> On the other hand, a 2008 study of 146 [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] concluded that the results of RCTs with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the RCTs' outcomes were [[Subjectivity|subjective]] as opposed to [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]].<ref name="Wood-2008">{{Cite journal | author = Wood L, Egger M, Gluud LL, Schulz KF, Jüni P, Altman DG, Gluud C, Martin RM, Wood AJ, Sterne JA | title = Empirical evidence of bias in treatment effect estimates in controlled trials with different interventions and outcomes: meta-epidemiological study | journal = BMJ | volume = 336 | issue = 7644 | pages = 601–5 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39465.451748.AD | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/336/7644/601 | pmid = 18316340 | pmc = 2267990 }}</ref>

== Blinding ==
An RCT may be [[Blind experiment|blinded]], (also called "masked") by "procedures that prevent study participants, caregivers, or outcome assessors from knowing which intervention was received."<ref name="Wood-2008"/> Unlike allocation concealment, blinding is sometimes inappropriate or impossible to perform in an RCT; for example, if an RCT involves a treatment in which active participation of the patient is necessary (e.g., [[physical therapy]]), participants cannot be blinded to the intervention.

Traditionally, blinded RCTs have been classified as "single-blind," "double-blind," or "triple-blind"; however, in 2001 and 2006 two studies showed that these terms have different meanings for different people.<ref name="Devereaux-2001">{{Cite journal | author = Devereaux PJ, Manns BJ, Ghali WA, Quan H, Lacchetti C, Montori VM, Bhandari M, Guyatt GH | title = Physician interpretations and textbook definitions of blinding terminology in randomized controlled trials | journal = [[J Am Med Assoc]] | volume = 285 | issue = 15 | pages = 2000–3 | year = 2001 | doi =  10.1001/jama.285.15.2000| url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/15/2000 | pmid = 11308438 }}</ref><ref name="Haahr-2006">{{Cite journal | author = Haahr MT, Hróbjartsson A | title = Who is blinded in randomized clinical trials?

RCTs without blinding are referred to as "unblinded",<ref name="Marson-2007">{{Cite journal | author = Marson AG, Al-Kharusi AM, Alwaidh M, Appleton R, Baker GA, Chadwick DW, et al | title = The SANAD study of effectiveness of valproate, lamotrigine, or topiramate for generalised and unclassifiable epilepsy: an unblinded randomised controlled trial | journal = [[The Lancet|Lancet]] | volume = 369 | issue = 9566 | pages = 1016–26 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60461-9 | pmid = 17382828 | pmc = 2039891 }}</ref> "open",<ref name="Chan-1995">{{Cite journal | author = Chan R, Hemeryck L, O'Regan M, Clancy L, Feely J | title = Oral versus intravenous antibiotics for community acquired lower respiratory tract infection in a general hospital: open, randomised controlled trial | journal = [[BMJ]] | volume = 310 | issue = 6991 | pages = 1360–2 | year = 1995 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/310/6991/1360 | pmid = 7787537 | pmc = 2549744 }}</ref> or (if the intervention is a medication) "[[Open-label trial|open-label]]".<ref name="Fukase-2008">{{Cite journal | author = Fukase K, Kato M, Kikuchi S, Inoue K, Uemura N, Okamoto S, Terao S, Amagai K, Hayashi S, Asaka M; Japan Gast Study Group | title = Effect of eradication of Helicobacter pylori on incidence of metachronous gastric carcinoma after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer: an open-label, randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 372 | issue = 9636 | pages = 392–7 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61159-9 | pmid = 18675689 }}</ref> In 2008 a study concluded that the results of unblinded RCTs tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the RCTs' outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective;<ref name="Wood-2008"/> for example, in an RCT of treatments for [[multiple sclerosis]], unblinded neurologists (but not the blinded neurologists) felt that the treatments were beneficial.<ref name="Noseworthy-1994">{{Cite journal | author = Noseworthy JH, Ebers GC, Vandervoort MK, Farquhar RE, Yetisir E, Roberts R | title = The impact of blinding on the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled multiple sclerosis clinical trial | journal = Neurology | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–20 | year = 1994 | url = http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/44/1/16 | pmid = 8290055 }}</ref> In pragmatic RCTs, although the participants and providers are often unblinded, it is "still desirable and often possible to blind the assessor or obtain an objective source of data for evaluation of outcomes."<ref name="Zwarenstein-2008"/>

==Analysis of data from RCTs==
The types of statistical methods used in RCTs depend on the characteristics of the data and include:
* For [[dichotomous]] (binary) outcome data, [[logistic regression]] (e.g., to predict sustained virological response after receipt of [[peginterferon alfa-2a]] for [[hepatitis C]]<ref name="Manns-2001">{{Cite journal | author = Manns MP, McHutchison JG, Gordon SC, Rustgi VK, Shiffman M, Reindollar R, Goodman ZD, Koury K, Ling M, Albrecht JK| title = Peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin compared with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin for initial treatment of chronic hepatitis C: a randomised trial | journal = [[The Lancet|Lancet]] | volume = 358 | issue = 9286 | pages = 958–65 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06102-5 | pmid = 11583749 }}</ref>) and other methods can be used.
* For continuous outcome data, [[analysis of covariance]] (e.g., for changes in blood lipid levels after receipt of [[atorvastatin]] after [[acute coronary syndrome]]<ref name="Schwartz-2001">{{Cite journal | author = Schwartz GG, Olsson AG, Ezekowitz MD, Ganz P, Oliver MF, Waters D, Zeiher A, Chaitman BR, Leslie S, Stern T; Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) Study Investigators | title = Effects of atorvastatin on early recurrent ischemic events in acute coronary syndromes: the MIRACL study: a randomized controlled trial | journal = [[J Am Med Assoc]] | volume = 285 | issue = 13 | pages = 1711–8 | year = 2001 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/13/1711 | pmid = 11277825 | doi = 10.1001/jama.285.13.1711 }}</ref>) tests the effects of predictor variables.
* For time-to-event outcome data that may be [[Censoring (statistics)|censored]], [[survival analysis]] (e.g., [[Kaplan–Meier estimator]]s and [[Cox proportional hazards model]]s for time to [[coronary heart disease]] after receipt of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy in menopause]]<ref name="Rossouw-2002">{{Cite journal | author = Rossouw JE, Anderson GL, Prentice RL, LaCroix AZ, Kooperberg C, Stefanick ML, Jackson RD, Beresford SA, Howard BV, Johnson KC, Kotchen JM, Ockene J; Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative Investigators | title = Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: principal results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial | journal = [[J Am Med Assoc]] | volume = 288 | issue = 3 | pages = 321–33 | year = 2002 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/288/3/321 | pmid = 12117397 | doi = 10.1001/jama.288.3.321 }}</ref>) is appropriate.

Regardless of the statistical methods used, important considerations in the analysis of RCT data include:
* Whether a RCT should be stopped early due to interim results.  For example, RCTs may be stopped early if an intervention produces "larger than expected benefit or harm," or if "investigators find evidence of no important difference between experimental and control interventions."<ref name="Moher-2010"/>
* The extent to which the groups can be analyzed exactly as they existed upon randomization (i.e., whether a so-called "[[intention-to-treat analysis]]" is used). A "pure" intention-to-treat analysis is "possible only when complete outcome data are available" for all randomized subjects;<ref name="Hollis-1999">{{Cite journal | author = Hollis S, Campbell F | title = What is meant by intention to treat analysis? Survey of published randomised controlled trials | journal = [[Br Med J]] | volume = 319 | issue = 7211 | pages = 670–4 | year = 1999 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/319/7211/670 | pmid = 10480822 | pmc = 28218 }}</ref> when some outcome data are missing, options include analyzing only cases with known outcomes and using [[Imputation (statistics)|imputed]] data.<ref name="Moher-2010"/> Nevertheless, the more that analyses can include all participants in the groups to which they were randomized, the less bias that an RCT will be subject to.<ref name="Moher-2010"/>
* Whether [[subgroup analysis]] should be performed.  These are "often discouraged" because [[multiple comparisons]] may produce false positive findings that cannot be confirmed by other studies.<ref name="Moher-2010"/>

==Reporting of RCT results==
The ''CONSORT 2010 Statement'' is "an evidence-based, minimum set of recommendations for reporting RCTs."<ref name="CONSORT">{{cite web |url=http://www.consort-statement.org |title=Welcome to the CONSORT statement Website |author=CONSORT Group |accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref> The CONSORT 2010 checklist contains 25 items (many with sub-items) focusing on "individually randomised, two group, parallel trials" which are the most common type of RCT.<ref name="Schulz-2010"/> For other RCT study designs, "CONSORT extensions" have been published.<ref name="Schulz-2010"/>

==Advantages==
RCTs are considered by most to be the most reliable form of [[scientific method|scientific evidence]] in the [[hierarchy of evidence]] that influences healthcare policy and practice because RCTs reduce spurious causality and bias. Results of RCTs may be combined in [[systematic review]]s which are increasingly being used in the conduct of [[evidence-based medicine]]. Some examples of scientific organizations' considering RCTs or systematic reviews of RCTs to be the highest-quality evidence available are:
* As of 1998, the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] of Australia designated "Level I" evidence as that "obtained from a [[systematic review]] of all relevant randomised controlled trials" and "Level II" evidence as that "obtained from at least one properly designed randomised controlled trial."<ref>{{cite book |url= http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/cp30.pdf |title= A guide to the development, implementation and evaluation of clinical practice guidelines |author= National Health and Medical Research Council |date=1998-11-16 |publisher= Commonwealth of Australia |location = Canberra | isbn = 1-86496-048-5 |page= 56|accessdate=2010-03-28}}</ref>
* Since at least 2001, in making [[clinical practice guideline]] recommendations the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] has considered both a study's design and its [[internal validity]] as indicators of its quality.<ref name="Harris-2001">{{Cite journal | author = Harris RP, Helfand M, Woolf SH, Lohr KN, Mulrow CD, Teutsch SM, Atkins D; Methods Work Group, Third US Preventive Services Task Force | title = Current methods of the US Preventive Services Task Force: a review of the process | journal = Am J Prev Med | volume = 20 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 21–35 | year = 2001 | url = http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/ajpmsuppl/review.pdf | pmid = 11306229 | doi = 10.1016/S0749-3797(01)00261-6 }}</ref> It has recognized "evidence obtained from at least one properly randomized controlled trial" with good [[internal validity]] (i.e., a rating of "I-good") as the highest quality evidence available to it.<ref name="Harris-2001"/>
* The [[Evidence-based medicine#Grade Working Group|GRADE Working Group]] concluded in 2008 that "randomised trials without important limitations constitute high quality evidence."<ref name="Guyatt-2008">{{Cite journal | author = Guyatt GH, Oxman AD, Kunz R, Vist GE, Falck-Ytter Y, Schünemann HJ; GRADE Working Group | title = What is "quality of evidence" and why is it important to clinicians? | journal = BMJ | volume = 336 | issue = 7651 | pages = 995–8 |year = 2008 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39490.551019.BE | pmc = 2364804 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/336/7651/995 | pmid = 18456631 }}</ref>
* For issues involving "Therapy/Prevention, Aetiology/Harm", the [[Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine]] as of 2011 defined "Level 1a" evidence as a systematic review of RCTs that are consistent with each other, and "Level 1b" evidence as an "individual RCT (with narrow [[Confidence Interval]])."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=1025 |title= Levels of evidence |author= Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine |date=2011-09-16 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref>

Notable RCTs with unexpected results that contributed to changes in clinical practice include:
* After [[Food and Drug Administration]] approval, the [[antiarrhythmic agents]] [[flecainide]] and [[encainide]] came to market in 1986 and 1987 respectively.<ref name="Anderson-1997">{{Cite journal | author = Anderson JL, Pratt CM, Waldo AL, Karagounis LA | title = Impact of the Food and Drug Administration approval of flecainide and encainide on coronary artery disease mortality: putting "Deadly Medicine" to the test | journal = Am J Cardiol | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–7 | year = 1997 | url = http://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002-9149%2896%2900673-X/abstract | pmid = 9024734 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9149(96)00673-X }}</ref> The non-randomized studies concerning the drugs were characterized as "glowing",<ref name="Rubin-2006">{{cite news |title= In medicine, evidence can be confusing - deluged with studies, doctors try to sort out what works, what doesn't |author= Rubin R |url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-10-15-medical-evidence-cover_x.htm |newspaper= USA Today |date= 2006-10-16 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}</ref> and their sales increased to a combined total of approximately 165,000 prescriptions per month in early 1989.<ref name="Anderson-1997"/>  In that year, however, a preliminary report of a RCT concluded that the two drugs increased mortality.<ref name="CAST-1989">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198908103210629 | title = Preliminary report: effect of encainide and flecainide on mortality in a randomized trial of arrhythmia suppression after myocardial infarction.

=== Limitations of external validity ===
The extent to which RCTs' results are applicable outside the RCTs varies; that is, RCTs' [[external validity]] may be limited.<ref name="Black-1996"/><ref name="Rothwell-2005">{{Cite journal | author = Rothwell PM | title = External validity of randomised controlled trials: "to whom do the results of this trial apply?" | journal = Lancet | volume = 365 | issue = 9453 | pages = 82–93 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17670-8 | url = http://apps.who.int/rhl/Lancet_365-9453.pdf | pmid = 15639683 }}</ref> Factors that can affect RCTs' external validity include:<ref name="Rothwell-2005"/>
* Where the RCT was performed (e.g., what works in one country may not work in another)

* Study procedures (e.g., in an RCT patients may receive intensive diagnostic procedures and follow-up care difficult to achieve in the "real world")
* Outcome measures (e.g., RCTs may use [[Scale (social sciences)#Composite measures|composite measures]] infrequently used in clinical practice)
* Incomplete reporting of adverse effects of interventions

=== Costs ===
RCTs can be expensive;<ref name="Sanson-Fisher-2007"/> one study found 28 [[Phase III]] RCTs funded by the [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] prior to 2000 with a total cost of US$335 million,<ref name="Johnston-2006">{{Cite journal | author = Johnston SC, Rootenberg JD, Katrak S, Smith WS, Elkins JS | title = Effect of a US National Institutes of Health programme of clinical trials on public health and costs | journal = [[The Lancet|Lancet]] | volume = 367 | issue = 9519 | pages = 1319–27 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68578-4 | url = http://www.chrp.org/pdf/HSR20070511.pdf | pmid = 16631910 }}</ref> for a [[mean]] cost of US$12 million per RCT.  Nevertheless, the [[return on investment]] of RCTs may be high, in that the same study projected that the 28 RCTs produced a "net benefit to society at 10-years" of 46 times the cost of the trials program, based on evaluating a [[quality-adjusted life year]] as equal to the prevailing mean [[per capita]] [[gross domestic product]].<ref name="Johnston-2006"/>

===Time===

=== Relative importance of RCTs and observational studies ===
Two studies published in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' in 2000 found that [[Observational study|observational studies]] and RCTs overall produced similar results.<ref name="Benson-2000">{{Cite journal | author = Benson K, Hartz AJ | title = A comparison of observational studies and randomized, controlled trials | journal = [[N Engl J Med]] | volume = 342 | issue = 25 | pages = 1878–86 | year = 2000 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/342/25/1878 | pmid = 10861324 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200006223422506 }}</ref><ref name="Concato-2000">{{Cite journal | author = Concato J, Shah N, Horwitz RI | title = Randomized, controlled trials, observational studies, and the hierarchy of research designs | journal = [[N Engl J Med]] | volume = 342 | issue = 25 | pages = 1887–92 | year = 2000 | url = http://nejm.highwire.org/cgi/content/full/342/25/1887 | pmid = 10861325 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200006223422507 | pmc = 1557642 }}</ref> The authors of the 2000 findings cast doubt on the ideas that "observational studies should not be used for defining evidence-based medical care" and that RCTs' results are "evidence of the highest grade."<ref name="Benson-2000"/><ref name="Concato-2000"/> However, a 2001 study published in ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' concluded that "discrepancies beyond chance do occur and differences in estimated magnitude of treatment effect are very common" between observational studies and RCTs.<ref name="Ioannidis-2001">{{Cite journal | author = Ioannidis JP, Haidich AB, Pappa M, Pantazis N, Kokori SI, Tektonidou MG, Contopoulos-Ioannidis DG, Lau J | title = Comparison of evidence of treatment effects in randomized and nonrandomized studies | journal = [[J Am Med Assoc]] | volume = 286 | issue = 7 | pages = 821–30 | year = 2001 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/286/7/821 | pmid = 11497536 | doi = 10.1001/jama.286.7.821 }}</ref>

Two other lines of reasoning question RCTs' contribution to scientific knowledge beyond other types of studies:
* If study designs are ranked by their potential for new discoveries, then [[Anecdotal evidence#Scientific context|anecdotal evidence]] would be at the top of the list, followed by observational studies, followed by RCTs.<ref name="Vandenbroucke-2008">{{Cite journal | author = Vandenbroucke JP | title = Observational research, randomised trials, and two views of medical science | journal = [[PLoS Med]] | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = e67 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050067 | pmid = 18336067 | pmc = 2265762 }}</ref>
* RCTs may be unnecessary for treatments that have dramatic and rapid effects relative to the expected stable or progressively worse natural course of the condition treated.<ref name="Black-1996"/><ref name="Glasziou-2007">{{Cite journal | author = Glasziou P, Chalmers I, Rawlins M, McCulloch P | title = When are randomised trials unnecessary?

===Difficulty in studying rare events===
Interventions to prevent events that occur only infrequently (e.g., [[sudden infant death syndrome]]) and uncommon adverse outcomes (e.g., a rare side effect of a drug) would require RCTs with extremely large sample sizes and may therefore best be assessed by observational studies.<ref name="Black-1996"/>

===Difficulty in studying outcomes in distant future===
It is costly to maintain RCTs for the years or decades that would be ideal for evaluating some interventions.<ref name="Black-1996"/><ref name="Sanson-Fisher-2007"/>

=== Pro-industry findings in industry-funded RCTs ===
Some RCTs are fully or partly funded by the health care industry (e.g., the [[pharmaceutical industry]]) as opposed to government, nonprofit, or other sources. A systematic review published in 2003 found four 1986-2002 articles comparing industry-sponsored and nonindustry-sponsored RCTs, and in all the articles there was a correlation of industry sponsorship and positive study outcome.<ref name="Bekelman-2003">{{Cite journal | author = Bekelman JE, Li Y, Gross CP | title = Scope and impact of financial conflicts of interest in biomedical research: a systematic review | journal = [[J Am Med Assoc]] | volume = 289 | issue = 4 | pages = 454–65 | year = 2003 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/289/4/454 | pmid = 12533125 | doi = 10.1001/jama.289.4.454 }}</ref> A 2004 study of 1999-2001 RCTs published in leading medical and surgical journals determined that industry-funded RCTs "are more likely to be associated with statistically significant pro-industry findings."<ref name="Bhandari-2004">{{Cite journal | author = Bhandari M, Busse JW, Jackowski D, Montori VM, Schünemann H, Sprague S, Mears D, Schemitsch EH, Heels-Ansdell D, Devereaux PJ | title = Association between industry funding and statistically significant pro-industry findings in medical and surgical randomized trials | journal = [[Can Med Assoc J]] | volume = 170 | issue = 4 | pages = 477–80 | year = 2004 | url = http://ecmaj.com/cgi/content/full/170/4/477 | pmid = 14970094 | pmc = 332713 }}</ref> One possible reason for the pro-industry results in industry-funded published RCTs is [[publication bias]].<ref name="Bhandari-2004"/>

===Therapeutic misconception===
Although subjects almost always provide [[informed consent]] for their participation in an RCT, studies since 1982 have documented that many RCT subjects believe that they are certain to receive treatment that is best for them personally; that is, they do not understand the difference between research and treatment.<ref name="Appelbaum-1982">{{Cite journal | author = Appelbaum PS, Roth LH, Lidz C | title = The therapeutic misconception: informed consent in psychiatric research | journal = [[Int J Law Psychiatry]] | volume = 5 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 319–29 | year = 1982 | doi = 10.1016/0160-2527(82)90026-7 | pmid = 6135666 }}</ref><ref name="Henderson-2007">{{Cite journal | author = Henderson GE, Churchill LR, Davis AM, Easter MM, Grady C, Joffe S, Kass N, King NM, Lidz CW, Miller FG, Nelson DK, Peppercorn J, Rothschild BB, Sankar P, Wilfond BS, Zimmer CR | title = Clinical trials and medical care: defining the therapeutic misconception | journal = [[PLoS Med]] | volume = 4 | issue = 11 | pages = e324 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0040324 | pmid = 18044980 | pmc = 2082641 }}</ref> Further research is necessary to determine the prevalence of and ways to address this "[[therapeutic misconception]]".<ref name="Henderson-2007"/>

===Narrowing of the studied question===
Randomized clinical trials are usually only inspect one variable or very few variables, rarely reflecting the full picture of a complicated medical situation; whereas the [[case report]], for example, can detail many different aspects of the patient’s [[medicine|medical]] situation (e.g. [[patient history]], [[physical examination]], [[diagnosis]], [[psychosocial]] aspects, follow up).<ref name="CaseReport"/>

=== Statistical error ===
RCTs are subject to both [[type I and type II errors|type I ("false positive") and type II ("false negative") statistical errors]].  Regarding Type I errors, a typical RCT will use 0.05 (i.e., 1 in 20) as the probability that the RCT will falsely find two equally effective treatments significantly different.<ref name="Wittes-2002">{{Cite journal | author = Wittes J | title = Sample size calculations for randomized controlled trials | journal = [[Epidemiol Rev]] | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–53 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1093/epirev/24.1.39 | pmid = 12119854 }}</ref> Regarding Type II errors, despite the publication of a 1978 paper noting that the [[sample size]]s of many "negative" RCTs were too small to make definitive conclusions about the negative results,<ref name="Freiman-1978">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197809282991304 | author = Freiman JA, Chalmers TC, Smith H Jr, Kuebler RR | title = The importance of beta, the type II error and sample size in the design and interpretation of the randomized control trial.

=== Cultural effects ===
The RCT method creates cultural effects that have not been well understood.<ref name="Jain-2010">{{Cite journal | author = Jain SL | title = The mortality effect: counting the dead in the cancer trial | journal = [[Public Culture]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–117 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1215/08992363-2009-017 }}</ref> For example, patients with terminal illness may attempt to join trials as a last-ditch attempt at treatment, even when treatments are unlikely to be successful.

=== Conflict of interest dangers ===

A 2011 study done to disclose possible conflicts of interests in underlying research studies used for medical meta-analyses  reviewed 29 meta-analyses and found that conflicts of interests in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed.  The 29 meta-analyses included 11 from general medicine journals; 15 from specialty medicine journals, and 3 from the [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] Database of Systematic Reviews. The 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 [[randomized controlled trials]] (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources with 219 (69%) industry funded. 132 of the 509 RCTs reported author conflict of interest disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing industry financial ties with one or more authors. The information was, however, seldom reflected in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and none reported RCT author-industry ties. The authors concluded “without acknowledgment of COI due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from RCTs included in meta-analyses, readers’ understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta-analysis may be compromised.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/news/blog/how-well-do-meta-analyses-disclose-conflicts-interests-underlying-research-studies |title=How Well Do Meta-Analyses Disclose Conflicts of Interests in Underlying Research Studies &#124; The Cochrane Collaboration |publisher=Cochrane.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref>

==Randomized controlled trials in the social sciences==

The use of RCTs in social sciences is a highly contested issue.  Some writers from a medical or health background have argued that existing research in a range of social science disciplines lacks rigour, and should be improved by greater use of randomized control trials{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.  The issue has been particularly controversial in transport studies, with some writers arguing that public spending on programmes such as school travel plans could not be justified unless their efficacy is demonstrated by randomized controlled trials.<ref name="Rowland et al (2003)">{{cite journal |author=Rowland, D., DiGuiseppi, C., Gross, M., Afolabi, E. and Roberts, I. |year=2003 |title=Randomised controlled trial of site specific advice on school travel patterns. |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=8–11}}</ref>  Graham-Rowe and colleagues<ref name="Graham-Rowe et al (2011)">{{cite journal |author=Graham-Rowe, E., Skippon, S., Gardner, B. and Abraham, C. |year=2011 |title=Can we reduce car use and, if so, how? A review of available evidence. |journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=401–418}}</ref>  reviewed 77 evaluations of transport interventions found in the literature, categorising them into 5 "quality levels".  They concluded that most of the studies were of low quality and advocated the use of randomized controlled trials wherever possible in future transport research.

Melia<ref name="Melia 2011">Melia(2011) [http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/16117/''Do Randomised Control Trials Offer a Solution to ’low Quality’ Transport Research?''] Bristol: University of the West of England]</ref> took issue with these conclusions, arguing that claims about the advantages of RCTs, in establishing causality and avoiding bias, have been exaggerated.  He proposed the following '''8 criteria for the use of RCTs in contexts where interventions must change human behaviour to be effective''':

The intervention:

#Has not been applied to all members of a unique group of people (e.g. the population of a whole country, all employees of a unique organisation etc.)
#Is applied in a context or setting similar to that which applies to the control group
#Can be isolated from other activities – and the purpose of the study is to assess this isolated effect
#Has a short timescale between its implementation and maturity of its effects

And the causal mechanisms:

#<li value="5">Are either known to the researchers, or else all possible alternatives can be tested
#Do not involve significant feedback mechanisms between the intervention group and external environments
#Have a stable and predictable relationship to exogenous factors
#Would act in the same way if the control group and intervention group were reversed

===International development===
RCTs are currently being used by a number of international development experts to measure the impact of development interventions worldwide.  [[Development economics|Development economists]] at research organizations including [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]]<ref>http://www.povertyactionlab.org/methodology</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author= Banerjee AV, Cole S, Duflo E, Linden L |year=2007 |title= Remedying education: evidence from two randomized experiments in India |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume= 122 |issue= 3 |pages= 1235–1264 |doi= 10.1162/qjec.122.3.1235 }}</ref> and [[Innovations for Poverty Action]]<ref name="Karlan-2010">{{cite journal |author=Karlan D, Zinman J |year=2010 |title=Expanding  credit  access:  using randomized supply decisions to estimate the impacts |journal=[[Review of Financial Studies]] |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=433–464 |doi=10.1093/rfs/hhp092 }}</ref> have used RCTs to measure the effectiveness of poverty, health, and education programs in the developing world. While RCTs can be useful in policy evaluation, it is necessary to exercise care in interpreting the results in social science settings. For example, interventions can inadvertently induce socioeconomic and behavioral changes that can confound the relationships (Bhargava, 2008).

For some development economists, the main benefit to using RCTs compared to other research methods is that randomization guards against selection bias, a problem present in many current studies of development policy. In one notable example of a cluster RCT in the field of development economics, Olken (2007) randomized 608 villages in Indonesia in which roads were about to be built into six groups (no audit vs. audit, and no invitations to accountability meetings vs. invitations to accountability meetings vs. invitations to accountability meetings along with anonymous comment forms).<ref name="Olken-2007">{{cite journal |author=Olken BA |year=2007 |title=Monitoring corruption: evidence from a field experiment in Indonesia |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=115 |issue= 2 |pages=200–249 |doi=10.1086/517935 }}</ref> After estimating "missing expenditures" (a measure of [[Political corruption|corruption]]), Olken concluded that government audits were more effective than "increasing grassroots participation in monitoring" in reducing corruption.<ref name="Olken-2007"/>
However, similar conclusions can also be reached by suitable modeling of the data from [[longitudinal studies]]. Overall, it is important in social sciences to account for the intended as well as the unintended consequences of interventions for policy evaluations.

===Criminology===
A 2005 review found 83 randomized experiments in criminology published in 1982-2004, compared with only 35 published in 1957-1981.<ref name="Farrington-2005">{{cite journal |author= Farrington DP, Welsh BC |year= 2005 |title= Randomized experiments in criminology: What have we learned in the last two decades? |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Criminology]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= 9–38 |doi= 10.1007/s11292-004-6460-0 }}</ref> The authors classified the studies they found into five categories: "policing", "prevention", "corrections", "court", and "community".<ref name="Farrington-2005"/>  Focusing only on offending behavior programs, Hollin (2008) argued that RCTs may be difficult to implement (e.g., if an RCT required "passing sentences that would randomly assign offenders to programmes") and therefore that experiments with [[quasi-experimental design]] are still necessary.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hollin CR |year= 2008 |title= Evaluating offending behaviour programmes: does only randomization glister? |journal=[[Criminology and Criminal Justice]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages= 89–106 |doi= 10.1177/1748895807085871 }}</ref>

===Education===
RCTs have been used in evaluating a number of educational interventions.  For example, a 2009 study randomized 260 elementary school teachers' classrooms to receive or not receive a program of behavioral screening, classroom intervention, and parent training, and then measured the behavioral and academic performance of their students.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walker HM, Seeley JR, Small J, Severson HH, Graham BA, Feil EG, Serna L, Golly AM, Forness SR |year= 2009 |title=A randomized controlled trial of the First Step to Success early intervention.
