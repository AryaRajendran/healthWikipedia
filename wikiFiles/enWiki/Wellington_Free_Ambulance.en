The '''Wellington Free Ambulance''' ('''WFA''') provides free to the patient [[ambulance]] services in the [[Wellington Region]] of New Zealand.

==History==
The ambulance service was created on 9 November 1927 by the mayor of Wellington, [[Charles Norwood|Sir Charles Norwood]], and initially operated out of the Old Navals boatshed. The service moved into a purpose built station on Cable Street in 1932, with Lord Bledisloe laying the foundation stone. The board created a long service medal for staff in 1956, for twelve (later ten) years service.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand: Medals Awarded by Organisations - The Wellington Free Ambulance Service Long Service Medal|url=http://www.medals.org.uk/new-zealand/new-zealand031.htm|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> In 1994 [[Prince Charles]] opened the new ambulance station in Davis Street, Thorndon, after a major fundraising drive.<ref name=NorthernCourier>{{cite web|title=Still Free After 80 Years|url=http://www.pcn.co.nz/northerncourier/stories/nc090507/nc090507-NEWS-Ambulance.htm|date=2007-05-09|work=Northern Courier|accessdate=2007-11-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
