The genus '''''Lonomia''''' is a moderate-sized group of fairly cryptic [[saturniidae|saturniid]] moths from [[South America]], famous not for the adults, but for their highly [[venom]]ous [[caterpillar]]s, which are responsible for a few deaths each year (e.g., [http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/179/2/158]), especially in southern [[Brazil]], and the subject of hundreds of published medical studies. They are commonly known as '''Giant Silkworm Moth''', a name also used for a wide range of other [[Saturniidae|Saturniid]] moths.<ref name="toxin">{{Citation| last =Meyer| first =W.L.| title =Book of Insect Records| url =http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_23.shtml| accessdate =March 18, 2011| date =May 1, 1996| publisher =Department of Entomology & Nematology, University of Florida| location =Gainsevuille, Florida| chapter =Chapter 23: Most Toxic Insect Venom}}</ref>

==Description==
The caterpillars are themselves extremely cryptic, blending in against the bark of trees, where the larvae commonly aggregate. The larvae, like most [[Hemileucinae|hemileucines]], are covered with [[urticating hair]]s, but these caterpillars possess a uniquely potent [[anticoagulant]] venom.

==Toxicity==
A typical envenomation incident involves a person unknowingly leaning against, placing their hand on, or rubbing their arm against a group of these caterpillars that are gathered on the trunk of a tree. The effects of a dose from multiple caterpillars can be dramatic and severe, including massive internal [[hemorrhage|hemorrhaging]], [[renal failure]], and [[hemolysis]]. The resulting medical syndrome is sometimes called '''Lonomiasis'''.

To date, no one has calculated the {{LD50}} values of ''Lonomia'' venom; the rate of human fatality has been documented as 1.7%.

While there are more than a dozen species in the genus, the most troublesome species is ''[[Lonomia obliqua]]'', and it is this species on which most of the medical research has centered. As anticoagulants have some very beneficial applications (e.g., prevention of life-threatening blood clots), a fair bit of the research is with the intent of deriving some pharmaceutically valuable chemicals.
