'''Graves' ophthalmopathy''' (also known as '''thyroid eye disease (TED)''', '''dysthyroid/thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO)''', '''Graves' orbitopathy''') is an [[autoimmune]] inflammatory disorder affecting the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] around the eye, characterized by upper eyelid retraction, swelling ([[edema]]), redness ([[erythema]]), [[conjunctivitis]], and bulging eyes ([[proptosis]]).<ref name="Bahn">[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/362/8/726 Graves' Ophthalmopathy], Rebecca S. Bahn, N Engl J Med, 362:726-738, February 25, 2010</ref>

It is part of a systemic process with variable expression in the eyes, thyroid, and skin, caused by autoantibodies that bind to tissues in those organs, and, in general, occurs with [[hyperthyroidism]].<ref name="Bahn"/> The most common form of hyperthyroidism is [[Graves' disease]]. About 10% of cases do not have Graves' disease, but do have autoantibodies. 

The autoantibodies target the fibroblasts in the eye muscles, and those fibroblasts can differentiate into fat cells ([[adipocytes]]). Fat cells and muscles expand and become inflamed. Veins become compressed, and are unable to drain fluid, causing [[edema]].<ref name="Bahn"/>

Annual incidence is 16/100,000 in women, 3/100,000 in men.
About 3-5% have severe disease with intense pain, and sight-threatening corneal ulceration or compression of the optic nerve. Cigarette smoking, which is associated with many autoimmune diseases, raises the incidence 7.7-fold.<ref name="Bahn"/>

Mild disease will often resolve and merely requires measures to reduce discomfort and dryness, such as artificial tears and [[smoking cessation]] if possible. Severe cases are a medical emergency, and are treated with [[glucocorticoid]]s (steroids), and sometimes [[cyclosporine]].<ref>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th Ed., Ch. 320, Disorders of the Thyroid Gland</ref> Many anti-inflammatory biological mediators, such as [[infliximab]], [[etanercept]], and [[anakinra]] are being tried, but there are no [[randomized controlled trial]]s demonstrating effectiveness.<ref name="Bahn"/>

==History==
In medical literature, [[Robert James Graves]], in 1835, was the first to describe the association of a thyroid [[goitre]] with [[exophthalmos]] of the eye.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|695|Robert James Graves}}</ref>  Graves' ophthalmopathy may occur before, with, or after the onset of overt thyroid disease and usually has a slow onset over many months.

==Epidemiology==
The pathology mostly affects persons of 30 to 50 years of age. Females are four times more likely to develop TAO than males. When males are affected, they tend to have a later onset and a poor prognosis. A study demonstrated that at the time of diagnosis, 90% of the patients with clinical orbitopathy were [[hyperthyroid]] according to thyroid function tests, while 3% had [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], 1% were [[hypothyroid]] and 6% did not have any thyroid function tests abnormality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bartley GB, Fatourechi V, Kadrmas EF, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical features of Graves' ophthalmopathy in an incidence cohort |journal=Am.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Graves Ophthalmopathy MRT 01.jpg|thumb|Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the orbits, showing congestion of the retro-orbital space and enlargement of the [[extraocular muscles]] (arrows), consistent with the diagnosis of Graves' Ophthalmopathy.]]
TAO is an orbital [[autoimmune disease]]. The [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] [[hormone receptor|receptor]] (TSH-R) is an [[antigen]] found in orbital fat and [[connective tissue]], and is a target for autoimmune assault. However, some patients with Graves’ orbitopathy present with neither [[anti-microsomal]] nor anti-[[thyroglobulin]] nor anti-[[TSH receptor]] antibodies, the [[antibodies]] identified in [[Graves' disease]].

On histological examination, there is an infiltration of the orbital connective tissue by [[lymphocytes]], [[plasmocytes]], and [[mastocytes]]. The inflammation results  in a deposition of [[collagen]] and [[glycosaminoglycans]] in the muscles, which leads to subsequent  enlargement and [[fibrosis]]. There is also an induction of the [[lipogenesis]] by [[fibroblasts]] and [[preadipocytes]], which causes orbital volume enlargement due to fat deposition.
Thyroid eye disease affects between 25-50% of patients with Graves' disease

==Signs and symptoms==
In mild disease,  patients [[presenting|present]] with eyelid retraction. In fact, upper eyelid retraction is the most common ocular sign of Graves' orbitopathy. This finding is associated with [[lid lag]] on infraduction ([[Von Graefe's sign]]), eye globe lag on supraduction ([[Kocher's sign]]), a widened [[palpebral fissure]] during fixation ([[Dalrymple's sign]]) and an incapacity of closing the eyelids completely ([[lagophthalmos]]). Due to the proptosis, eyelid retraction and lagophthalmos, the cornea is more prone to dryness and may present with [[chemosis]], [[punctate epithelial erosions]] and [[superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis]]. The patients also have a dysfunction of the lacrimal gland with a decrease of the quantity and composition of tears produced. [[Non-specific symptom]]s with these pathologies include irritation, grittiness, [[photophobia]], tearing, and blurred vision. Pain is not typical, but patients often complain of pressure in the orbit.  Periorbital swelling due to inflammation can also be observed.

In moderate active disease, the signs and symptoms are persistent and increasing and include [[myopathy]]. The inflammation and [[edema]] of the extraocular muscles lead to gaze abnormalities.  The [[inferior rectus muscle]] is the most commonly affected muscle and patient may experience vertical [[diplopia]] on upgaze and limitation of elevation of the eyes due to [[fibrosis]] of the muscle.  This may also increase the intraocular pressure of the eyes.  The double vision is initially intermittent but can gradually become chronic. The medial rectus is the second-most-commonly-affected muscle, but multiple muscles may be affected, in an asymmetric fashion.  

In more severe and active disease, mass effects and cicatricial changes occur within the orbit. This is manifested by a progressive [[exophthalmos]], a restrictive myopathy that restricts eye movements and an optic neuropathy. With enlargement of the extraocular muscle at the orbital apex, the optic nerve is at risk of compression. The orbital fat or the stretching of the nerve due to increased orbital volume may also lead to optic nerve damage. The patient experiences a loss of visual acuity, [[visual field]] defect, [[afferent pupillary defect]], and loss of color vision. This is an emergency and requires immediate surgery to prevent permanent blindness.

==Diagnostic==
Graves' ophthalmopathy is diagnosed clinically by the presenting ocular signs and symptoms, but positive tests for [[antibodies]] (anti-thyroglobulin, anti-microsomal and anti-thyrotropin receptor) and abnormalities in [[thyroid hormones]] level (T3, T4, and TSH) help in supporting the diagnosis.  

Orbital imaging is an interesting tool for the diagnosis of Graves' ophthalmopathy and is useful in monitoring patients for progression of the disease.  It is, however, not warranted when the diagnosis can be established clinically. [[Ultrasonography]] may detect early Graves' orbitopathy in patients without clinical orbital findings. It is less reliable than the [[CT scan]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), however, to assess the extraocular muscle involvement at the orbital apex, which may lead to blindness. Thus, CT scan or MRI is necessary when optic nerve involvement is suspected. On neuroimaging, the most characteristic findings are thick extraocular muscles with [[tendon]] sparing, usually bilateral, and proptosis.

===Classification of Graves' eye disease===

Class 0: No signs or symptoms

Class 1: Only signs (limited to upper lid retraction and stare, with or without lid lag)

Class 2: Soft tissue involvement (oedema of conjunctivae and lids, conjunctival injection, etc.)

Class 3: Proptosis

Class 4: Extraocular muscle involvement (usually with diplopia)

Class 5: Corneal involvement (primarily due to lagophthalmos)

Class 6: Sight loss (due to optic nerve involvement)

==Treatment==
Even though some patients undergo spontaneous remission of symptoms within a year, many need treatment. The first step is the regulation of thyroid hormone levels by a physician.

Topical lubrication of the ocular surface is used to avoid corneal damage caused by exposure. [[Tarsorrhaphy]] is an alternative option when the complications of ocular exposure can't be avoided solely with the drops. 

[[Corticosteroids]] are efficient in reducing orbital inflammation, but the benefits cease after discontinuation. Corticosteroids treatment is also limited because of their many side-effects. [[Radiotherapy]] is an alternative option to reduce acute orbital inflammation.  However, there is still controversy surrounding its efficacy. A simple way of reducing inflammation is smoking cessation, as pro-inflammatory substances are found in cigarettes. 

Surgery may be done to decompress the orbit, to improve the proptosis, and to address the [[strabismus]] causing diplopia. Surgery is performed once the patient’s disease has been stable for at least six months. In severe cases, however, the surgery becomes urgent to prevent blindness from optic nerve compression. Because the eye socket is bone, there is nowhere for eye muscle swelling to be accommodated, and, as a result, the eye is pushed forward into a protruded position. In some patients, this is very pronounced. Orbital decompression involves removing some bone from the eye socket to open up one or more sinuses and so make space for the swollen tissue and allowing the eye to move back into normal position and also relieving compression of the optic nerve that can threaten sight.

Eyelid surgery is the most common surgery performed on Graves ophthalmopathy patients. Lid-lengthening surgeries can be done on upper and lower eyelid to correct the patient’s appearance and the ocular surface exposure symptoms. Marginal [[myotomy]] of [[levator palpebrae]] muscle can reduce the [[palpebral fissure]] height by 2–3&nbsp;mm. When there is a more severe upper lid retraction or exposure keratitis, marginal myotomy of levator palpebrae associated with lateral [[tarsus (eyelids)|tarsal]] [[canthoplasty]] is recommended. This procedure can lower the upper eyelid by as much as 8&nbsp;mm. Other approaches include müllerectomy (resection of the [[superior tarsal muscle|Müller muscle]]), eyelid spacer grafts, and recession of the lower eyelid retractors. [[Blepharoplasty]] can also be done to debulk the excess fat in the lower eyelid.<ref>{{cite web | author=Muratet JM |title=Eyelid retraction |work=Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery |url=http://www.snof.org/chirurgie/eyelidsurg6.html |publisher=Le Syndicat National des Ophtalmologistes de France |accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref>

An article in the New England Journal of Medicine reports that treatment with selenium is effective in mild cases.
<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1012985?query=TOC</ref>

A large European study performed by the European Group On Graves’ Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) has recently shown that the trace element selenium had a significant effect in patients with mild, active thyroid eye disease. Six months of selenium supplements had a beneficial effect on thyroid eye disease and were associated with improvement in the quality of life of participants. These positive effects persisted at 12 months. There were no side-effects.<ref>http://www.btf-thyroid.org/index.php/thyroid/research-news/selenium-supplements-and-thyroid</ref>

==Poor prognostic indicators==
Risk factors of progressive and severe thyroid-associated orbitopathy are:

*Age greater than 50 years
*Rapid onset of symptoms under 3 months
*Cigarette smoking
*[[Diabetes]]
*Severe or uncontrolled [[hyperthyroidism]]
*Presence of [[pretibial myxedema]]
*High [[cholesterol]] levels ([[hyperlipidemia]])
*[[Peripheral vascular disease]]
