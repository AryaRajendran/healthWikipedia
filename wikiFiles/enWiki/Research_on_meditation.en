These studies have shown substantial bodily changes as a consequence of regular meditative practice.

Since the 1950s, 3,000 studies on meditation have been conducted and yet many of the early studies had multiple flaws and thus yielded less conclusive data.<ref name="State of the Research">{{cite web | last = Ospina | first = M | coauthors = Bond T | title = Meditation Practices for Health: State of the Research.

Meditation has been practiced within religious traditions since ancient times, especially within monastic centers. These days there also exist many secular programs in the West including [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness-based programs]].<ref>The following was taken from [[MBSR]]... "Jon Kabat-Zinn has said that his program has nothing at all to do with Buddhism, it is not spiritually based, and is therefore open to everyone no matter what life circumstances they are in.[reference-> In this video Jon Kabat-Zinn can be seen giving a speech at Google Headquarters about mindfulness, including the benefits shown by scientific study, the practice and principles of mindfulness, and how it relates to modern life in general http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSU8ftmmhmw Mindfulness-based stress] MBSR is practiced by those old and young, sick and healthy, professionals and monks alike.

==Meditation within Western psychology==

===The relaxation response===
Dr. [[Herbert Benson]], founder of the Mind-Body Medical Institute, which is affiliated with [[Harvard University]] and several Boston hospitals, reports that meditation induces a host of biochemical and physical changes in the body collectively referred to as the "relaxation response".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Benson H | year = 1997 | month = Dec | title = The relaxation response: therapeutic effect | url = | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue = 5344| pages = 1694–5 | pmid = 9411784 }}</ref> The relaxation response includes changes in metabolism, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure and brain chemistry. Benson and his team have also done clinical studies at Buddhist monasteries in the [[Himalaya]]n Mountains.<ref>{{cite news|author=Cromie, William J.|title=Meditation changes temperatures: Mind controls body in extreme experiments|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070524212421/http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html|date=18 April 2002|work=Harvard University Gazette|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College via Internet Archive|accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref> Benson wrote ''[[The Relaxation Response]]'' to document the benefits of meditation, which in 1975 were not yet widely-known.<ref>{{cite book|author=Benson, Herbert|title=The Relaxation Response|year=2001|first=1975|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-380-81595-8|pages=61–63}}</ref>

===Calming effects of meditation===
According to a March 2006 article in the "Psychological Bulletin", EEG activity begins to slow as a result of the practice of meditation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cahn|first=Rael|coauthors=John Polich|title=Meditation states and traits: EEG, ERP, and neuroimaging studies|journal=Psychological  Bulletin|year=2006|month=March|volume=132|issue=2|pages=180–211|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.132.2.180|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/132/2/180/|accessdate=2012-03-03|pmid=16536641}}</ref> The human nervous system is composed of a parasympathetic system, which works to regulate heart rate, breathing and other involuntary motor functions, and a sympathetic system, which arouses the body, preparing it for vigorous activity. The [[National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health (NIH)]] has written, "It is thought that some types of meditation might work by reducing activity in the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and increasing activity in the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]," or equivalently, that meditation produces a reduction in arousal and increase in relaxation.

===Western therapeutic use and MBSR===
{{See also|Mindfulness (psychology)|Mindfulness-based stress reduction}}
Meditation has entered the mainstream of health care as a method of [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[Pain and nociception|pain]] reduction. As a method of stress reduction, meditation has been used in hospitals in cases of chronic or terminal illness to reduce complications associated with increased stress that include depressed [[immune systems]].  There is growing agreement in the medical community that mental factors such as stress significantly contribute to a lack of physical health, and there is a growing movement in mainstream science to fund research in this area. There are now  several mainstream health care programs which aid those, both sick and [[Positive psychology|healthy]], in promoting their inner well-being, especially [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness-based programs such as Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR)]].

A 2003 [[meta-analysis]] found that mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which involves continuous awareness of consciousness, without seeking to censor thoughts, concluded that the form of meditation may be broadly useful for individuals attempting to cope with clinical and nonclinical problems.  Diagnoses for which MBSR was found to be helpful included [[chronic pain]], [[fibromyalgia]], cancer patients and [[coronary artery disease]].  Improvements were noted for both physical and mental health measures.<ref name="MBSR 2003 meta-analysis">{{cite pmid | 15256293 }}</ref>

===Flow===
[[Mindfulness (psychology)|Mindfulness]] meditation, [[anapanasati]], and related techniques, are intended to train attention for the sake of provoking insight. A wider, more flexible attention span makes it easier to be aware of a situation, easier to be objective in emotionally or morally difficult situations, and easier to achieve a state of responsive, creative awareness or "[[Flow (psychology)|flow]]".<ref>.ref name="flow">[http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol3Iss1/Commentary.htm Commentary: In the Zone: A Biobehavioral Theory of the Flow Experience]</ref> Research from Harvard medical school also shows that during meditation, physiological signals show that there is a decrease in respiration and increase in heart rate and blood oxygen saturation levels.<ref>.ref name="flow">[http://www.massgeneral.org/bhi/assets/pdfs/publications/lazar_2000_neuroreport.pdf Functional brain mapping of the relaxation response and meditation]</ref>

==Research by style of meditation==

===Insight meditation===
{{Main|Insight_meditation#Scientific_studies}}
A study done by Yale, Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital have shown that meditation increases gray matter in specific regions of the brain and may slow the deterioration of the brain as a part of the natural aging process.

The experiment included 20 individuals with intensive Buddhist "insight meditation" training and 15 who did not meditate. The brain scan revealed that those who meditated have an increased thickness of gray matter in parts of the brain that are responsible for attention and processing sensory input. Some of the participants meditated for 40 minutes a day while others had been doing it for years. The results showed that the change in brain thickness depended upon the amount of time spent in meditation. The increase in thickness ranged between .004 and .008&nbsp;inches (0.1016mm – 0.2032mm).<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/11/051110215950.htm Meditation Associated With Increased Grey Matter In The Brain<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Meditation experience is associated with increased cortical thickness by Sara W.

===Kundalini yoga meditation===
{{Main|Kundalini_yoga#Medical_research}}
There have been some preliminary studies done on some of the many types of meditation found within the branch of Yoga known as Kundalini. One study showed the cooling of meditators hands as they practiced Sahaja Yoga meditation and another study showed some relaxation while meditators paid attention to their breathing.

A study comparing practitioners of Sahaja Yoga meditation with a group of non meditators doing a simple relaxation exercise, measured a drop in skin temperature in the meditators compared to a rise in skin temperature in the non meditators as they relaxed. The researchers noted that all other meditation studies that have observed skin temperature have recorded increases and none have recorded a decrease in skin temperature. This suggests that Sahaja Yoga meditation, being a mental silence approach, may differ both experientially and physiologically from simple relaxation.<ref name="Manocha et al">Manocha R, Black D, Ryan J, Stough C, Spiro D, [http://www.researchingmeditation.org/blog/category/meditation/sahaja-yoga-meditation] "This study demonstrates a skin temperature reduction on the palms of the hands during the experience of mental silence, arising as a result of a single 10 minute session of Sahaja yoga meditation."

===Integrative body-mind training===
A study involving the participation of a group of colleges students, who were asked to use a meditation technique called integrative body-mind training (IBMT involves body relaxation, mental imagery, and mindfulness training), concluded that "meditating may improve the integrity and efficiency of certain connections in the brain" through an increase in their number and robustness<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/08/meditation-boosts-part-of-brain-where-add-addictions-reside.ars|title=Meditation boosts part of brain where ADD, addictions reside|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> Brain scans showed strong [[white matter]] changes in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100816155000.htm|title=|title=Integrative body-mind training (IBMT) meditation found to boost brain connectivity|publisher=[[ScienceDaily]]|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>

===Zazen===
Dr. James Austin, a neurophysiologist at the [[University of Colorado Health Sciences Center|University of Colorado]], reported that [[Yoga#Yoga_and_Zen|meditation in Zen]] "rewires the circuitry" of the brain in his book ''[[Zen and the Brain]]'' (Austin, 1999). This has been confirmed using [[functional MRI]] imaging, a brain scanning technique that measures blood flow in the brain. {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.

[[Electroencephalography|Electroencephalograph]] (EEG) recordings of skilled meditators showed a significant rise in [[gamma wave]] activity during meditation, somewhere in the 80 to 120&nbsp;Hz range. There was also a rise in the range of 25 to 42&nbsp;Hz. These meditators had 10 to 40 years of training in compassion meditation training and were engaging in non-referential compassion meditation during the study. The experienced meditators also showed increased gamma activity while at rest and not meditating.<ref name="Lutz"/> Several controls who hadn't practiced meditation before were compared to the highly-trained monks and showed significantly less rise in gamma activity during meditation.<ref name="Lutz">

===Mental Silence===
Prior to 2006, the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] defined meditation as “a conscious mental process that induces a set of integrated physiological changes termed the relaxation response”. The NCCAM reviewed its definition of meditation to include a new central feature: “In meditation, a person learns to focus his attention and suspend the stream of thoughts that normally occupy the mind”.<ref name="NCCAM_definition">{{cite web | title = Terms Related to Complementary and Alternative Medicine | publisher = National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine | url = http://nccam.nih.gov/health/providers/camterms.htm | format = [[etext]] | accessdate = 2012-01-27}}</ref> This definition is more in line with the traditional eastern understanding of meditation as inner silence.<ref name="inner_silence">{{cite web | last = Sasson | first = Remez | title = Emptiness, Inner Silence, Nonduality and Meditation | publisher = SuccessConsciousness.com | url = http://www.successconsciousness.com/emptiness-inner-silence.htm | format = [[etext]] | accessdate = 2012-01-27}}</ref> Some recent studies have used this definition of meditation to compare the experience of mental silence with simple relaxation and found some significant physiological differences between the two.<ref name="Mind_emptiness">{{cite web | last = Manocha | first = Ramesh | title = Meditation, mindfulness and mind-emptiness | publisher = Acta Neuropsychiatrica | date = 2011-01-05 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1601-5215.2010.00519.x/full#b6 | format = [[etext]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1601-5215.2010.00519.x | accessdate = 2011-07-26}}</ref>

</ref> First they classify five patterns in meditation based on the normal four frequency ranges (delta < 4&nbsp;Hz, theta 4 to <8&nbsp;Hz, alpha 8 to 13&nbsp;Hz, and beta >13&nbsp;Hz). The five patterns they found were:
:1) delta
:2) delta + theta
:3) theta + slow alpha
:4) high-amplitude alpha
:5) amplitude suppressed ("silent and almost flat")
They found pattern No. 5 unique and characterized by:
:1) extremely low power (significant suppression of EEG amplitude)
:2) corresponding temporal patterns with no particular EEG rhythm
:3) no dominating peak in the spectral distribution

They had collected EEG patterns from more than 50 meditators over the prior five years. Five meditation EEG scenarios are then described. They further state that most meditation is dominated by alpha waves. They found delta and theta waves occurred occasionally, sometimes while people fell asleep and sometimes not. In particular they found the amplitude suppressed pattern correlated with "the feeling of blessings."

in Cognitive Sciences 4(2), is the first to interrelate the work on synchronized gamma in consciousness with the well-attested work on gamma in meditation in an experimental context. It adduces experimental and simulated data to show that what both have in common is the ability to put the brain into a state in which it is maximally sensitive and consumes power at a lower (or even zero) rate, briefly. It is argued that this may correspond to a “selfless” state and the more typical non-zero state, in which gamma is not so prominent, corresponds to a state of empirical self. Thus, the “zero power” in the title refers not only to the power spectrum of the brain as measured by the [[Hilbert transform]], but also to a psychological state of personal renunciation.

===Meditation and perception===
Studies have shown that meditation has both short-term and long-term effects on various perceptual faculties.

In 1984, Brown ''et al.'' conducted a study that measured the absolute threshold of perception for light stimulus duration in practitioners and non-practitioners of mindfulness meditation. The results showed that meditators have a significantly lower detection threshold for light stimuli of short duration.<ref>Brown, Daniel, et al.  "Differences in Visual Sensitivity Among Mindfulness Meditators and Non-Meditators". Perceptual and Motor Skills 1984: 727–733.</ref>

In 2000, Tloczynski ''et al.'' studied the perception of visual illusions (the [[Müller-Lyer Illusion]] and the [[Poggendorff Illusion]]) by zen masters, novice meditators, and non-meditators. There were no statistically significant effects found for the Müller-Lyer illusion, however, there were for the Poggendorff. The zen masters experienced a statistically significant reduction in initial illusion (measured as error in millimeters) and a lower decrement in illusion for subsequent trials.<ref>Tloczynski, Joseph, et al., "Perception of Visual Illusions by Novice and Longer-Term Meditators". Perceptual and Motor Skills 2000: 1021–1027.</ref>

The theory of mechanism behind the changes in perception that accompany mindfulness meditation is described thus by Tloczynski:

<blockquote>“A person who meditates consequently perceives objects more as directly experienced stimuli and less as concepts… With the removal or minimization of cognitive stimuli and generally increasing awareness, meditation can therefore influence both the quality (accuracy) and quantity (detection) of perception.”{{Cite quote|date=November 2008}}</blockquote>

Brown also points to this as a possible explanation of the phenomenon: “[the higher rate of detection of single light flashes] involves quieting some of the higher mental processes which normally obstruct the perception of subtle events.” In other words, the practice may temporarily or permanently alter some of the top-down processing involved in filtering subtle events usually deemed noise by the perceptual filters.

===Sleep need===
Kaul et al. found that sleep duration in long-term experienced meditators was lower than in non-meditators and general population norms, with no apparent decrements in vigilance.<ref>Meditation acutely improves psychomotor vigilance, and may decrease sleep need.

==Potential adverse effects of meditating==
The following is an official statement from the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]]-run [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]:
<blockquote>Meditation is considered to be safe for healthy people. There have been rare reports that meditation could cause or worsen symptoms in people who have certain psychiatric problems, but this question has not been fully researched. People with physical limitations may not be able to participate in certain meditative practices involving physical movement. Individuals with existing mental or physical health conditions should speak with their health care providers prior to starting a meditative practice and make their meditation instructor aware of their condition.<ref name="NCAAM overview" /></blockquote>

Adverse effects have been reported,<ref>From a clinical study of twenty-seven long term meditators, Shapiro found that subjects reported significantly more positive effects than negative from meditation. However, of the twenty-seven subjects, seventeen (62.9%) reported at least one adverse effect, and two (7.4%) suffered profound adverse effects. Among these we find: ''relaxation-induced anxiety and panic; paradoxical increases in tension; less motivation in life; boredom; pain; impaired reality testing; confusion and disorientation; feeling 'spaced out'; depression; increased negativity; being more judgmental; and, ironically, feeling addicted to meditation'' Shapiro 1992, cited in Perez-De-Albeniz, Alberto and Holmes, Jeremy.

As with any practice, meditation may also be used to avoid facing ongoing problems or emerging crises in the meditator's life. In such situations, it may instead be helpful to apply [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindful attitudes]] acquired in meditation while actively engaging with current problems.<ref>Hayes, 1999, chap. 3; Metzner, 2005</ref> According to the [[National Institute of Health|NIH]], meditation should not be used as a replacement for conventional health care or as a reason to postpone seeing a doctor.<ref name="NCAAM overview">Meditation: An Introduction on the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine's webpage, NCAAM is a subdivision of NIH. http://nccam.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm#meditation</ref>

[[Kundalini syndrome]] is a claimed adverse effect from practicing [[Kundalini Yoga]] (or other related spiritual practices).

In June, 2007 the United States [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM) published an independent, peer-reviewed, meta-analysis of the state of meditation research, conducted by researchers at the [[University of Alberta]] Evidence-based Practice Center.  The report reviewed 813 studies involving five broad categories of meditation: [[mantra]] meditation, [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness meditation]], [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]], and [[Qigong]], and included all studies on adults through September 2005, with a particular focus on research pertaining to [[hypertension]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and [[substance abuse]].

The report concluded, "Scientific research on meditation practices does not appear to have a common theoretical perspective and is characterized by poor methodological quality. Firm conclusions on the effects of meditation practices in healthcare cannot be drawn based on the available evidence. Future research on meditation practices must be more rigorous in the design and execution of studies and in the analysis and reporting of results." (p.&nbsp;6) It noted that there is no theoretical explanation of health effects from meditation common to all meditation techniques.<ref>Ospina MB, Bond TK, Karkhaneh M, Tjosvold L, Vandermeer B, Liang Y, Bialy L, Hooton N, Buscemi N, Dryden DM, Klassen TP.

(Prepared by the University of Alberta Evidence-based Practice Center under Contract No. 290-02-0023.) AHRQ Publication No. 07-E010. Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. June 2007.</ref>

A version of this report subsequently published in the ''Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine'' stated that "Most clinical trials on meditation practices are generally characterized by poor methodological quality with significant threats to [[validity]] in every major quality domain assessed". This was the conclusion despite a [[statistically significant]] increase in  quality of all reviewed meditation research, in general, over time between 1956–2005. Of the 400 clinical studies, 10% were found to be good quality. A call was made for rigorous study of meditation.<ref name="NCCAM 2008">{{cite journal |author=Ospina MB, Bond K, Karkhaneh M, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical trials of meditation practices in health care: characteristics and quality |journal=J Altern Complement Med |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=1199–213 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19123875 |doi=10.1089/acm.2008.0307 |url=}}</ref> These authors also noted that this finding is not unique to the area of meditation research and that the quality of reporting is a frequent problem in other areas of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research and related therapy research domains.

Of more than 3,000 scientific studies that were found in a comprehensive search of 17 relevant databases, only about 4% had randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are designed to exclude the placebo effect.<ref name="State of the Research"/> Reviews of these RCTs consistently find that meditation without a focus on developing "mental silence", an aspect often excluded from techniques used in Western society, does not give better results than simply relaxing, listening to music or taking a short nap. While those who practiced mental silence showed clinically and statistically significant improvements in work related stress, depressed feelings, asthma-control, and quality of life as compared to commonly used stress management programs.<ref name="Mind_emptiness"/>
