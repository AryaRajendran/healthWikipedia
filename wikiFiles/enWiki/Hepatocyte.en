A '''hepatocyte''' is a cell of the main tissue of the [[liver]]. Hepatocytes make up 70-85% of the liver's [[cytoplasm]]ic mass.
These cells are involved in:
* [[Protein synthesis]] 
* [[Protein storage]]
* Transformation of [[carbohydrate]]s
* Synthesis of [[cholesterol]], [[bile salt]]s and [[phospholipid]]s
* Detoxification, modification, and excretion of exogenous and endogenous substances
The hepatocyte also initiates formation and secretion of [[bile]].

==Structure==
The typical hepatocyte forms a cubical cell of 15 µm sides (in comparison, a human hair has a diameter of 17 to 180 µm). The typical volume of a hepatocyte is 3.4 x 10<sup>-9</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>. <ref>Lodish, H., Berk, A., Zipursky, S. L., Matsudaira, P., Baltimore, D., Darnell, J. E. Molecular Cell Biology (Fifth Edition). W. H. Freeman and Company. New York, 2000, pp 10. </ref>

The [[Endoplasmic_reticulum#Smooth_endoplasmic_reticulum|smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] (Smooth ER) is an abundant organelle in hepatocytes, whereas most cells in the body have small amounts of smooth ER. <ref>Lodish, H., Berk, A., Zipursky, S. L., Matsudaira, P., Baltimore, D., Darnell, J. E. Molecular Cell Biology (Fifth Edition). W. H. Freeman and Company. New York, 2000, pp 168. </ref>

==Histology==
Hepatocytes display an [[eosinophilic]] cytoplasm, reflecting numerous [[mitochondria]], and [[basophilic]] stippling due to large amounts of [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] and free [[ribosomes]]. Brown [[lipofuscin]] granules are also observed (with increasing age) together with irregular unstained areas of cytoplasm; these correspond to cytoplasmic [[glycogen]] and [[lipid]] stores removed during histological preparation. The average life span of the hepatocyte is 5 months; they are able to [[Regeneration (biology)#Regeneration of human liver|regenerate]].

Hepatocyte [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] are round with dispersed [[chromatin]] and prominent [[nucleoli]]. Anisokaryosis is common and often reflects [[tetraploidy]] and other degrees of [[polyploidy]], a normal feature of 30-40% of hepatocytes in adult human liver.<ref>{{cite article |url=http://www.kelly-landes.org/journals/cc/14-Celton-MorizurCC9-3.pdf |title=Polyploidy and liver proliferation |month=February |year=2010 |author=Séverine Celton-Morizur |coauthors=Grégory Merlen, Dominique Couton, Chantal Desdouets |journal=Cell Cycle |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=460-466 |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> Binucleate cells are also common.

Hepatocytes are organised into plates separated by vascular channels ([[Liver sinusoid|sinusoids]]), an arrangement supported by a [[Reticular fiber|reticulin]] (collagen type III) network. The hepatocyte plates are one cell thick in mammals and two cells thick in the chicken. Sinusoids display a discontinuous, fenestrated [[endothelial]] cell lining. The endothelial cells have no [[basement membrane]] and are separated from the hepatocytes by the [[space of Disse]], which drains [[lymph]] into the portal tract [[lymphatics]].

[[Kupffer cell]]s are scattered between endothelial cells; they are part of the [[reticuloendothelial system]] and phagocytose spent [[erythrocytes]]. [[Stellate cell|Stellate (Ito) cells]] store [[vitamin A]] and produce [[extracellular matrix]] and [[collagen]]; they are also distributed amongst endothelial cells but are difficult to visualise by light microscopy.

Hepatocytes are an important physiological example for evalutation of both biological and [[metabolic]] effects of [[xenobiotics]]. They are separated from the liver by [[collagenase]] digestion, which is a two step process. In the first step, the liver is placed in an [[Isotonicity|isotonic]] solution, in which calcium is removed to disrupt cell-cell [[tight junctions]] by the use of a calcium [[Chelation|chelating agent]]. Next, a solution containing collagenase is added to separate the hepatocytes from the liver [[stromal_cell|stroma]]. This process creates a suspension of hepatocytes, which can be cultured and plated on 96 well plates for immediate use, or [[Cryopreservation|cryopreserved]] by freezing.<ref> Li, Albert P.; "Screening for human ADME/Tox drug properties in Drug Discovery": Drug Discovery Today, Vol. 6, No. 7, April 2001, pp. 357-366 </ref> They do not proliferate in culture. Hepatocytes are intensely sensitive to damage during the cycles of cryopreservation including freezing and thawing. Even after the addition of classical [[cryoprotectant]]s there is still damage done while being cryopreserved. <ref> Hamel et al.; "Wheat Extracts as an Efficient Cryoprotective Agent for Primary Cultures of Rat Hepatocytes": published online 21 Aug 2006 in Wiley Interscience www.interscience.wiley.com.

==Protein synthesis==
The hepatocyte is a [[cell (biology)|cell]] in the [[body]] that manufactures [[serum albumin]], [[fibrinogen]], and the [[prothrombin]] group of [[clotting factor]]s (except for Factors 3 and 4).

It is the main site for the synthesis of [[lipoprotein]]s, [[ceruloplasmin]], [[transferrin]], [[Complement system|complement]], and [[glycoprotein]]s.
Hepatocytes manufacture their own structural proteins and intracellular [[enzyme]]s.

Synthesis of proteins is  by the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] (RER), and both the rough and [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] (SER) are involved in secretion of the proteins formed.

The [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) is involved in [[Conjugated protein|conjugation of proteins]] to lipid and carbohydrate moieties synthesized by, or modified within, the hepatocytes.

==Carbohydrate metabolism==
{{seealso|Lipogenesis}}
The [[liver]] forms fatty acids from [[carbohydrate]]s and synthesizes triglycerides from fatty acids and glycerol.
Hepatocytes also synthesize [[Apolipoprotein|apoprotein]]s with which they then assemble and export lipoproteins ([[Very low density lipoprotein|VLDL]], [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]]).

The liver is also the main site in the body for [[gluconeogenesis]], the formation of carbohydrates from precursors such as [[alanine]], [[glycerol]], and [[oxaloacetate]].

==Lipid metabolism==
The liver receives many [[lipid]]s from the systemic circulation and metabolizes [[chylomicron]] remnants.
It also synthesizes [[cholesterol]] from [[acetate]] and further synthesizes [[bile salt]]s.
The liver is the sole site of bile salts formation.

==Detoxification==
Hepatocytes have the ability to metabolize, detoxify, and inactivate exogenous compounds such as [[medication|drugs]], ([[drug metabolism]]), and [[insecticide]]s, and endogenous compounds such as [[steroid]]s.

The drainage of the [[intestinal]] [[venous]] [[blood]] into the [[liver]] requires efficient detoxification of miscellaneous absorbed substances to maintain [[homeostasis]] and protect the body against ingested toxins.

One of the detoxifying functions of hepatocytes is to modify ammonia into [[urea]] for excretion.

The most abundant organelle in liver cell is the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.
