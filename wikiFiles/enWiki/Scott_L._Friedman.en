'''Scott L. Friedman''' (born June 13, 1955) is an American scientist, professor and physician who works in the field of [[hepatology]]. Friedman has conducted pioneering research into the underlying causes of scarring, or [[fibrosis]], associated with chronic liver disease, by characterizing the key [[Fibrogenesis|fibrogenic]] cell type, the [[hepatic stellate cell]]<ref name="autogenerated1985">[http://www.pnas.org/content/82/24/8681.abstract "Hepatic lipocytes: the principal collagen-producing cells of normal rat liver."] Friedman, Roll, Boyles and Bissell. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. December 1985. 82(24): 8681ñ8685.</ref> His laboratory has also discovered a novel tumor suppressor gene, KLF6 that is inactivated in a number of human cancers including primary liver cancer.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/5551/2563 "KLF6, a Candidate Tumor Suppressor Gene Mutated in Prostate Cancer"]. Multiple Authors. ''Science''. December 21, 2001. Vol. 294. no. 5551, pp. 2563 - 2566.</ref> Friedman is the Fishberg Professor of Medicine, and Chief of the Division of Liver Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Friedman has two children, a son, Leor Friedman, and a daughter, Yael Friedman.

==Early life and education==

Friedman was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]].  His father was a medical doctor whose specialty was [[Radiology]], and his mother was a high school business education teacher. His brother is [[Jeffrey M. Friedman]]. From  the age of five, he grew up in [[North Woodmere]] on [[Long Island, NY]] and attended public schools in the Hewlett-Woodmere School District #14. 

He attended [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Troy, New York]], leaving at the end of his junior year to begin medical school at the [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]].

Friedman returned to Rensselaer in June 1976 and graduated Cum Laude with a BS degree, and he received his medical degree from Mount Sinai in 1979.

==Career==

At age 24, Friedman began postgraduate training in [[Internal Medicine]] at the [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center|Beth Israel Hospital]] of [[Harvard Medical School]] in [[Boston, MA]]. Later he completed a fellowship in Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF) School of Medicine, where he was appointed to the faculty in 1986.

It was at UCSF that Friedman became the first scientist to isolate the hepatic stellate cell, which is responsible for hepatic fibrosis,<ref name="autogenerated1985"/> a scarring process that can lead to [[cirrhosis]] of the liver.

In 1997, Friedman returned to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine where he has held the positions of Fishberg Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Division of Liver Diseases.<ref>[http://www.mssm.edu/profiles/scott-l-friedman "Scott L. Friedman"]. Mount Sinai School of Medicine profile (retrieved April 29, 2010)</ref>

In 2003, Friedman received the International Hans Popper Award, given every 3 years to the most outstanding liver investigator worldwide under the age of 50.<ref>''Gastroenterology''. Lang, L. Volume 126. Issue 1. Page 4. (abstract retrieved from http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016508503018638, April 29, 2010)</ref>  He assumed a major leadership role in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), serving as a Governing Board member (2005–2010) and President (2009).<ref>[http://www.aasld.org/about/leadership/Pages/Friedman.aspx "Scott L. Friedman"]. American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (retrieved April 28, 2010).</ref>

Other achievements in hepatic research include authoring over 300 scientific articles; serving as a senior editor of the textbook, ''Current Diagnosis and Treatment in Gastroenterology''; and conducting novel research in hepatic fibrosis.

==Research==

Beginning in 1985 with Friedman's description of the role of the hepatic stellate cell in liver fibrosis, his laboratory at UCSF and then at Mount Sinai has conducted novel studies that have advanced the understanding of liver disease.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WFX-4SFRVY5-3&_user=9282394&_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2008&_alid=1320785140&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_cdi=6806&_sort=r&_docanchor=&view=c&_ct=56&_acct=C000000333&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=9282394&md5=4fc78387955614333e62b5d64940d6f1 "Mechanisms of Hepatic Fibrosis"]. Friedman, Scott L. ''Gastroenterology''. Volume 134, Issue 6, May 2008. pp. 1655-1669 (retrieved from ScienceDirect.Com).</ref> These studies have been continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health for 25 years.

One of his laboratory's other key discoveries is a novel tumor suppressor gene, KLF6, which is inactivated in a number of human cancers, including primary liver cancer.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/109712309/HTMLSTART "Frequent inactivation of the tumor suppressor Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) in hepatocellular carcinoma"]. Friedman, Scott L., et al. ''Hepatology''. October 14, 2004. Volume 40, Issue 5, pp. 1047-1052.</ref>

Friedman took a sabbatical in 1995 to become a Fulbright Senior Scholar at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, conducting research in the laboratory of Professor Moshe Oren.

He has authored over 300 scientific articles, and he has served as mentor to over 50 students, physicians, and postdoctoral trainees.
