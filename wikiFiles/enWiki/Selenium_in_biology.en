Although it is toxic in large doses, '''[[selenium]]''' is an essential [[micronutrient]] for animals. In plants, it sometimes occurs in amounts toxic as [[forage]], e.g. [[locoweed]]. Selenium is a component of the [[amino acid]]s [[selenocysteine]] and [[selenomethionine]]. In humans, selenium is a [[dietary mineral|trace element]] nutrient that functions as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for [[glutathione peroxidase]]s and certain forms of [[thioredoxin reductase]].<ref>S. J. Lippard, J. M. Berg "Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry" University Science Books: Mill Valley, CA; 1994.  ISBN 0-935702-73-3.</ref> Selenium-containing proteins are produced from inorganic selenium via the intermediacy of [[Selenophosphate synthetase 1|selenophosphate]] (PSeO<sub>3</sub><sup>3-</sup>).

==Se-containing biomolecules==

===Glutathione peroxidase===
The [[glutathione peroxidase]] family of enzymes (abbreviated GSH-Px) catalyze reduction of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and organic [[hydroperoxide]]s:

:2H + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>   →   GSSG  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>O
The two H atoms are donated by thiols in a process that begins with oxidation of a [[selenol]] side chain in GSH-Px.  The [[organoselenium compound]] [[ebselen]] is a drug used to to supplement the action of GSH-Px.  It functions as a catalyst for the destruction of hydrogen peroxide.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bhabak Krishna P., Mugesh Govindasamy | year = 2010 | title = Functional Mimics of Glutathione Peroxidase: Bioinspired Synthetic Antioxidants | url = | journal = Acc.

A related selenium-containing enzyme in some plants and in animals ([[thioredoxin reductase]]) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme [[ribonucleotide reductase]] that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.<ref name="Stadtman">{{cite journal |author=Stadtman TC |title=Selenocysteine |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=65 |issue= |pages=83–100 |year=1996 |pmid=8811175 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.65.070196.000503}}</ref>

===Deiodinases===
Selenium also plays a role in the functioning of the [[thyroid]] gland.  It participates as a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for the three [[thyroid hormone]] [[deiodinase]]s.  These enzymes activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/selenium/ |publisher = Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University |title = Selenium |accessdate = 2009-01-05}}</ref> It may inhibit [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis|Hashimotos's disease]], in which the body's own thyroid cells are attacked as alien.

===Formate dehydrogenase===
Some microorganisms ulitize selenium in in [[formate dehydrogenase]]. Formate is produced in large amounts in the hepatic (liver cells) mitochondria of embryonic cells and in cancer cells by the folate cycle.<ref>H Frederik Nijhout, et al, In silico experimentation with a model of hepatic mitochondrial folate metabolism, Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling, 2006, 3:40, link http://www.tbiomed.com/content/3/1/40/abstract).</ref>

==Nutritional sources of selenium==
Dietary selenium comes from nuts, cereals, meat, mushrooms, fish, and eggs. [[Brazil nut]]s are the richest ordinary dietary source (though this is soil-dependent, since the Brazil nut does not require high levels of the element for its own needs). In descending order of concentration, high levels are also found in [[kidney]], [[tuna]], [[crab]], and [[lobster]].<ref>{{cite journal |last = Barclay |first = Margaret N. I. |coauthors = Allan MacPherson, James Dixon |year = 1995 |title=Selenium content of a range of UK food |journal=Journal of food composition and analysis |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages = 307–318 |doi = 10.1006/jfca.1995.1025 }}</ref><ref>A list of selenium-rich foods can be found on [http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h2 The Office of Dietary Supplements Selenium Fact Sheet].</ref>

The human body's content of selenium is believed to be in the 13–20 milligram range.<ref>The most popular web reference for this is [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=6424964].</ref>

==Indicator plants==
Certain species of plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil, since they require high levels of selenium to thrive. The main selenium indicator plants are ''[[Astragalus]]'' species (including some [[locoweed]]s), prince's plume (''[[Stanleya (plant)|Stanleya]]'' sp.), woody asters (''[[Xylorhiza]]'' sp.), and false goldenweed (''[[Oonopsis]]'' sp.)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/54282000/PPClassPPSlides/3-27-08DavisSelenium.pdf |title = Selenium in Plants |accessdate = 2008-12-05 |author= Zane Davis, T. |year = 2008 |page=8}}</ref>

==Medical use of synthetic selenium compounds==
The substance loosely called [[selenium disulfide|selenium sulfide]] (with the approximate formula SeS<sub>2</sub>) is the active ingredient in some anti-dandruff shampoos.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://pharmacycode.com/Selenium(IV)_sulfide.html |title =Selenium(IV)_sulfide |publisher = Pharmacy Codes |accessdate = 2009-01-06}}</ref> The selenium compound kills the scalp fungus ''[[Malassezia]]'', which causes shedding of dry skin fragments. The ingredient is also used in body lotions to treat [[Tinea versicolor]] due to infection by a different species of ''Malassezia'' fungus.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/selenium.html |title = Selenium sulfide |publisher = DermNet NZ |accessdate = 2009-01-06}}</ref>

==Detection in biological fluids==
Selenium may be measured in blood, plasma, serum or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in a forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior to being eliminated in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1416–1420.</ref>

==Toxicity==
Although selenium is an essential [[dietary mineral|trace element]], it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the [[Dietary Reference Intake|Tolerable Upper Intake Level]] of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h7 |title = Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Selenium |publisher = National Institutes of Health; Office of Dietary Supplements |accessdate = 2009-01-05}}</ref> This 400 microgram ([[Microgram|µg]]) Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992.<ref>{{cite book |title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids |publisher = Institute of Medicine |date = August 15, 2000 |pages = 314–315 |url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9810&page=315 |isbn = 0-309-06949-1 |author = a report of the Panel on Dietary Antioxidants and Related Compounds, Subcommittees on Upper Reference Leves of Nutrients and of Interpretation and Use of Dietary Reference Intakes, and the Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine.}}</ref> The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to not only avoid [[toxicity]], but also to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to account for data from other countries.<ref>

Symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage.

[[Selenium Pollution|Selenium poisoning]] of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry, undeveloped lands. This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds (such as selenates) into the water, which may then be concentrated in new "wetlands" as the water evaporates. High selenium levels produced in this fashion have been found to have caused certain congenital disorders in wetland birds.<ref>{{cite book |url = http://books.google.com/?id=qN0I3husm50C&pg=PA477 |chapter = Ecotoxicology of selenium |title = Handbook of ecotoxicology |first = H.

In fish and other wildlife, low levels of selenium cause deficiency while high levels cause toxicity.  For example, in salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium in the fish tissue (whole body) is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of tissue (dry weight).

==Deficiency==
{{main|Selenium deficiency}}
Selenium deficiency is rare in healthy, well-nourished individuals. It can occur in patients with severely compromised [[intestine|intestinal]] function, those undergoing [[total parenteral nutrition]], and<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/71/2/590 |title = Effect of micronutrient status on natural killer cell immune function in healthy free-living subjects aged >=90 y1 |author = Ravaglia ''et al.'' |volume = 71 |issue = 2 |pages = 590–598 |journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |pmid = 10648276 |date=1 February 2000 |last2 = Forti |first2 = P |last3 = Maioli |first3 = F |last4 = Bastagli |first4 = L |last5 = Facchini |first5 = A |last6 = Mariani |first6 = E |last7 = Savarino |first7 = L |last8 = Sassi |first8 = S |last9 = Cucinotta |first9 = D}}</ref> in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk.

There are interactions between selenium and other nutrients, such as [[iodine]] and [[vitamin E]]. The interaction is observed in the [[etiology]] of many deficiency diseases in animals and pure selenium deficiency is rare. The effect of selenium deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly in relation to [[Kashin-Beck disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/78/1/137?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=selenium&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&resourcetype=HWCIT |title = Selenium and iodine supplementation of rural Tibetan children affected by Kashin-Beck osteoarthropathy |first1 = Rodrigo |last1 =Moreno-Reyes |first2 = Jean |last2 =Mathieu| first3 = Marleen |last3 =Vanderpas| first4 = Françoise |last4 = Begaux| first5 = Carl |last5 =Suetens| first6 = Maria T. |last6 =Rivera| first7 = Jean |last7 =Nève| first8 = Noémi |last8 =Perlmutter |journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume = 78 |issue = 1 |pages = 137–144 |year = 2003 |author9=V |pmid=12816783}}</ref>

==Controversial health claims==
Selenium contains many interesting epidemiological associations with various diseases in animals and humans. However, in randomized, blinded, controlled prospective trials in humans, selenium supplementation has not succeeded in reducing the incidence of any disease. Nor has a meta analysis of such selenium supplementation studies detected a decrease in overall mortality.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid =22419320|year =2012|last1 =Bjelakovic|first1 =G|last2 =Nikolova|first2 =D|last3 =Gluud|first3 =LL|last4 =Simonetti|first4 =RG|last5 =Gluud|first5 =C|title =Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases|volume =3|pages =CD007176|doi =10.1002/14651858.CD007176.pub2|journal =Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|editor1-last =Bjelakovic|editor1-first =Goran}}</ref>

===Cancer===
Individual studies have found conflicting results regarding selenium exposure and specific cancers. A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] review of studies concluded that "no reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding a causal relationship between low selenium exposure and an increased risk of cancer," and that "regular intake of selenium supplements for cancer prevention cannot be recommended to either the selenium-replete or deficient populations."<ref>{{cite journal |author= Dennert G, Zwahlen M, Brinkman M, ''et al.'' |title= Selenium for preventing cancer |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=5 |pages= CD005195 |year=2011 |pmid= 21563143 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD005195/frame.html |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005195.pub2 |volume=5 |editor1-last= Dennert |editor1-first= Gabriele}}</ref> A different Cochrane review found that "there is insufficient evidence at present that selenium supplementation alleviates the side effects of tumour specific chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatments or that it improves the after-effects of surgery, or improves quality-of-life in cancer patients or reduces secondary lymphoedema.

===HIV/AIDS===
Some research has indicated a geographical link between regions of selenium-deficient soils and peak incidences of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] infection. For example, much of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] is low in selenium. However, [[Senegal]] is not, and also has a significantly lower level of AIDS infection than the rest of the continent. AIDS appears to involve a slow and progressive decline in levels of selenium in the body{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. Whether this decline in selenium levels is a direct result of the replication of HIV<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patrick L |title=Nutrients and HIV: part one – beta carotene and selenium |journal=Alternative Medicine Review |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=403–13 |year=1999 |pmid=10608913 |url=http://www.thorne.com/altmedrev/.fulltext/4/6/403.pdf}}</ref> or related more generally to the overall malabsorption of nutrients by AIDS patients remains debated.

[[Observational studies]] have found an association between decreased selenium levels and poorer outcomes in patients with HIV, though these studies were mostly done prior to the currently effective treatments with highly active antiretroviral therapy, or [[HAART]].  Currently there is inadequate evidence to recommend routine selenium supplementation for HIV patients, and further research is recommended.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stone CA, Kawai K, Kupka R, Fawzi WW |title=Role of selenium in HIV infection |journal=Nutr.

===Diabetes===
A well-controlled study showed selenium levels are positively correlated with the risk of having [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]].

==Evolution in biology and biosynthetic considerations==

From about three billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein families drive the evolution of selenocysteine. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes as selenocysteine,<ref name="glady">{{cite journal |author=Gladyshev VN, Hatfield DL |title=Selenocysteine-containing proteins in mammals |journal=Journal of Biomedical Science |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=151–60 |year=1999 |pmid=10343164 |doi=10.1007/BF02255899}}</ref> where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells seem to have a bacterial [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in utilization of the small reducing molecules [[glutathione]] and [[thioredoxin]]. 

Trace elements involved in GSH-Px and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities, i.e. selenium, [[vanadium]], [[magnesium]], [[copper]], and [[zinc]], may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral-deficient areas.<ref name="glady" /> Marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their seleno-proteomes, whereas the seleno-proteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost. These findings suggest that, with the exception of [[vertebrate]]s, aquatic life supports selenium utilization, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lobanov AV, Fomenko DE, Zhang Y, Sengupta A, Hatfield DL, Gladyshev VN |title=Evolutionary dynamics of eukaryotic selenoproteomes: large selenoproteomes may associate with aquatic life and small with terrestrial life |journal=Genome Biology |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=R198 |year=2007 |pmid=17880704 |pmc=2375036 |doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-9-r198}}</ref> Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine. From about 500 Mya, freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of "new" endogenous antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C), [[polyphenol]]s (including flavonoids), [[tocopherol]]s, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in the last 50–200 million years, in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants. In fact, the angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late [[Jurassic]] period.

About 200 Mya, new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian GSH-Px enzymes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Castellano S, Novoselov SV, Kryukov GV, ''et al.'' |title=Reconsidering the evolution of eukaryotic selenoproteins: a novel nonmammalian family with scattered phylogenetic distribution |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71–7 |year=2004 |pmid=14710190 |pmc=1298953 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400036}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kryukov GV, Gladyshev VN |title=The prokaryotic selenoproteome |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=538–43 |year=2004 |pmid=15105824 |pmc=1299047 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400126}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilting R, Schorling S, Persson BC, Böck A |title=Selenoprotein synthesis in archaea: identification of an mRNA element of Methanococcus jannaschii probably directing selenocysteine insertion |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=266 |issue=4 |pages=637–41 |year=1997 |pmid=9102456 |doi=10.1006/jmbi.1996.0812}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhang Y, Fomenko DE, Gladyshev VN |title=The microbial selenoproteome of the Sargasso Sea |journal=Genome Biology |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=R37 |year=2005 |pmid=15833124 |pmc=1088965 |doi=10.1186/gb-2005-6-4-r37}}</ref>
