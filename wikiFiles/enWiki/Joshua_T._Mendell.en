'''Joshua T. Mendell''', M.D., Ph.D., is an associate professor of pediatrics and molecular biology and genetics at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], where he is a faculty member of the [[Victor A. McKusick|McKusick]]-[[Daniel Nathans|Nathans]] Institute of Genetic Medicine.<ref name=IGMFaculty>[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/geneticmedicine/people/faculty/mendell.html Johns Hopkins School of Medicine faculty webpage]</ref> Mendell is a [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] early career scientist<ref name=HHMI>[http://www.hhmi.biz/research/ecs/mendell_bio.html HHMI biography]</ref> and a preceptor for two Johns Hopkins graduate programs. His [[molecular biology]] research examines [[microRNA]] (miRNA) regulation and function, with particular emphasis on miRNAs and [[cancer]].<ref name=IGMFaculty/>

==Training and career==
Mendell began working in a molecular biology laboratory when he was a teenager and continued to perform laboratory research as an undergraduate at [[Cornell University]].<ref name=HHMI/> He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1996. Mendell pursued a [[Ph.D.]] and [[M.D.]] at Johns Hopkins University, receiving the degrees in 2001 and 2003 respectively. He remained at Johns Hopkins as a faculty member.<ref name=IGMFaculty/>

==Research==
Mendell and members of his research group investigate post-transcriptional gene regulation. As a graduate student with Harry (Hal) Dietz at Johns Hopkins, Mendell researched how cells recognize and degrade [[messenger RNA]] molecules with early [[stop codon]]s, a process known as [[nonsense mediated decay]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|11073994}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|11152657}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|11719181}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|12228722}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|15448691}}</ref> Mendell's interest in RNA led him into the field of microRNA.<ref name=HHMI/>

In 2005, Mendell reported in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''  that a [[oncogene|gene often mutated in cancer cells]], [[Myc|c-Myc]], influences the expression of several miRNAs encoded in a cluster on human chromosome 13. These miRNAs in turn affect the expression of a c-Myc-induced [[transcription factor]], [[E2F1]]. This research demonstrated a potentially important role for miRNAs in the development of cancer. Mendell has followed up on this work with publications in high-impact journals including ''[[Nature Genetics]]'',<ref>{{Cite pmid|16878133}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|18066065}}</ref> ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]'',<ref>{{Cite pmid|19211792}}</ref> ''[[Molecular Cell]]'',<ref>{{Cite pmid|17540599}}</ref> ''Nature'',<ref>{{Cite pmid|19219026}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|19359480}}</ref> and ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'',<ref>{{Cite pmid|19450510}}</ref> among others.

In 2009, Mendell reported in the journal ''Cell'' that treating mice with therapeutic levels of specific miRNAs could suppress development of liver cancer.<ref>{{Cite pmid|19524505}}</ref> The publication generated media interest,<ref>[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/44613/title/Replacing_microRNA_fo Replacing microRNA for cancer treatment.] Jenny Lauren Lee, Science News, July 4, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090611120732.htm MicroRNA Replacement Therapy May Stop Cancer In Its Tracks] Science Daily, June 12, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153651.php Cancer May Be Stopped In Its Tracks By MicroRNA Replacement Therapy] Medical News Today, June 13, 2009</ref> including an article in ''[[The Times]]'' asking, "Is there a secret to eternal youth?"<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article6825180.ece?print=yes&randnum=1151003209000 Dorian Gray: Is there a secret to eternal youth?] Anjana Ahuja, The Times, September 8, 2009</ref>

Mendell has also published numerous review articles on miRNA regulation and function.<ref>{{Cite pmid|16495913}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|17028598}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|18423194}}</ref>

==Family==
Mendell credits his father, [[Ohio State University]] neurologist Jerry Mendell, with influencing his early interest and involvement in molecular biology research,<ref name=HHMI/> and Mendell's first scientific publication was co-written with his father and other researchers.<ref>{{Cite pmid|10694916}}</ref>

Mendell generated data on c-Myc and miRNAs in collaboration with Kathryn O'Donnell. Mendell and O'Donnell are now married and continue to work together on miRNA-related projects.<ref name=HHMI/>
