'''Polymorphous light eruption''' ('''PLE'''), or '''polymorphic light eruption''' ('''PMLE'''), is a skin condition caused by [[sunlight]].

== Types ==
Two subtypes have been described:<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
:*[[Juvenile spring eruption]]
:*[[Benign summer light eruption]]

==Presentation==
Symptoms include skin irritations, which may be itchy or painful, and are sometimes confused with [[hives]].  These irritations appear upon exposure to sunlight—sometimes only hours after exposure<ref name="pmid15191561">{{cite journal |author=Schornagel IJ, Sigurdsson V, Nijhuis EH, Bruijnzeel-Koomen CA, Knol EF |title=Decreased neutrophil skin infiltration after UVB exposure in patients with polymorphous light eruption |journal=J. Invest. Dermatol. |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=202–6 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15191561 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-202X.2004.22734.x}}</ref>—and may last from 1 to 7 days.

==Epidemiology==
The cases of this condition are most common between the spring and autumn months in the [[northern hemisphere]].

Typically, 5-20% of fair skinned populations are affected, but it can occur in any skin type.<ref name="Httpwwwclinuvelcomskinconditionscommonskinconditionspolymorphouslighteruptionple">http://www.clinuvel.com/skin-conditions/common-skin-conditions/polymorphous-light-eruption-ple</ref> It is more common in females than in males. The condition can affect all ethnic groups and research suggests that 20% of patients have a family history of the complaint.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  Those suffering from PLE usually do so by age 30.

==Causes and prevention==
It has been noted that PMLE is caused by an immune reaction to a compound in the skin which is altered by exposure to ultraviolet light. It can be provoked by UVA or UVB rays. 

The cause of PLE is not yet understood. It is thought to be due to a [[Type IV hypersensitivity|type IV]] delayed-type [[hypersensitivity]] to an allergen produced in the body following sunlight exposure.<ref name="Httpwwwclinuvelcomskinconditionscommonskinconditionspolymorphouslighteruptionple" />

One may also purchase clothing that has been tested for its protective qualities.

Some progression to autoimmune disease has been observed.<ref name="pmid9762018">{{cite journal |author=Hasan T, Ranki A, Jansen CT, Karvonen J |title=Disease associations in polymorphous light eruption. A long-term follow-up study of 94 patients |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=134 |issue=9 |pages=1081–5 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9762018 |doi= 10.1001/archderm.134.9.1081|url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9762018}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Generally, PLE resolves without treatment; also, PLE irritations generally leave no scar.
