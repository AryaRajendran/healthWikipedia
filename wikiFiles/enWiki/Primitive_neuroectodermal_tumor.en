'''Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor''' (PNET) is a [[neural crest]] tumor.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000112249|primitive neuroectodermal tumor}}</ref> It is a rare [[tumor]], usually occurring in children and young adults under 25 years of age. The overall 5 year survival rate  is about 53%.<ref name=Smoll20111/>

It gets its name because the majority of the cells in the tumor are derived from [[neuroectoderm]], but have not developed and differentiated in the way a normal [[neuron]] would, and so the cells appear "primitive". 

PNET belongs to the [[Ewing family of tumors]].

==Classification==
It is classified into two types, based on location in the body: peripheral PNET and CNS PNET.

===Peripheral PNET===
The peripheral PNET (pPNET) is now thought to be virtually identical to [[Ewing's sarcoma|Ewing sarcoma]]:

"Current evidence indicates that both Ewing's sarcoma and PNET have a similar neural phenotype and, because they share an identical chromosome translocation, they should be viewed as the same tumor, differing only in their degree of neural differentiation. Tumors that demonstrate neural differentiation by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, or electron microscopy have been traditionally labeled PNETs, and those that are undifferentiated by these analyses have been diagnosed as Ewing's sarcoma."<ref name="robbins">Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelso; Abbas, Abul (2004) ''Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease'' (7th ed.). Saunders. Page 1301. ISBN 0-7216-0187-1.</ref>

===PNET of the CNS===

PNET of the CNS generally refer to supratentorial PNETs.

* In the past [[medulloblastoma]]s were considered PNETs, however they are genetically, transcriptionally and clinically distinct. As such "infratentorial" PNETs are now referred to as medulloblastoma {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}. 

* [[Pineoblastoma]]s are embryonal tumours originating in the [[Pineal gland]], and are likely distinct from supratentorial PNETs.

==Survival==
Patients diagnosed with a medulloblastoma or PNET are 50 times more likely to die than a matched member of the general population. The 5-year relative survival estimates (based on data from 2001–2006) are 64% in children (1–9 years) and 35% in adults (20+ years).<ref name=Smoll20111>{{cite doi|10.1002/cncr.26387}}</ref>

==Model==
Using gene transfer of SV40 large T-antigen in neuronal precursor cells of rats, a brain tumor model was established. The PNETs were histologically indistinguishable from the human counterparts and have been used to identify new genes involved in human brain tumor carcinogenesis.<ref name="pmid8129041">{{cite journal |author=Eibl RH, Kleihues P, Jat PS, Wiestler OD |title=A model for primitive neuroectodermal tumors in transgenic neural transplants harboring the SV40 large T antigen |journal=Am.
