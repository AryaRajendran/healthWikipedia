The '''Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine''' ('''JHUSOM'''), located in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], [[United States|U.S.]], is the academic medical teaching and research arm of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Johns Hopkins has consistently been the nation's top medical school in the number of research grants awarded by the [[National Institutes of Health]]. Its major teaching hospital, the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], was ranked the best hospital in the United States every year between 1991 and 2011 by ''U.S. News and World Report''.<ref name="usnews1">http://health.usnews.com/health-news/best-hospitals/articles/2012/07/16/best-hospitals-2012-13-the-honor-roll U.S. News Best Hospitals: the Honor Roll].

==Overview==

The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine is located in the East Baltimore campus of [[Johns Hopkins University]] together with the [[Bloomberg School of Public Health]], and the [[Johns Hopkins School of Nursing|School of Nursing]]. Known collectively as the "Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions" (JHMI) Campus,<ref>[http://www.jhmi.edu index]. Jhmi.edu. Retrieved on 2011-04-03.</ref> it comprises several city blocks, radiating outwards from the Billings building of the Johns Hopkins Hospital with its historic dome. The founding physicians of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine included pathologist [[William H. Welch|William Henry Welch]] (1850-1934), the first dean of the school and a mentor to generations of research scientists; internist Sir [[William Osler]] (1849-1919), sometimes referred to as the “father of modern medicine,” having been perhaps the most influential physician of the late 19th and early 20th centuries as author of ''The Principles and Practice of Medicine'' (1892), written at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] and published for more than a century; surgeon [[William Stewart Halsted]] (1852-1922), who revolutionized surgery by insisting on subtle skill and technique, as well as strict adherence to sanitary procedures; and gynecologist [[Howard Atwood Kelly]] (1858-1943), a superb gynecological surgeon often credited with establishing gynecology as a specialty and being among the first to use radium to treat cancer.  

The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine is affiliated with the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], its major [[teaching hospital]], as well as several other regional medical centers, including the [[Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center]], [[Howard County General Hospital]], Suburban Hospital in Montgomery County, Maryland, and [[Sibley Memorial Hospital]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name="Patient Care Locations">[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/patient_care/hospital_locations.html]. Retrieved on 2011-11-02.</ref> Together they form an [[academic health science center]].

==Reputation==
For years, Johns Hopkins has been the nation's top medical school in the number of competitive research grants awarded by the [[National Institutes of Health]]. According to ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'', Johns Hopkins, [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard]], and [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine|UPenn]] have consistently been ranked in the top three medical research schools in the nation.<ref>[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/med/brief/mdrrank_brief.php Best Graduate Schools | Top Graduate Programs | US News Education].

The School has served as the model for American medical schools since its founding in 1893.<ref>Ludmerer, Kenneth. [http://www.case.edu/artsci/wrss/documents/wrs2001-02ludmerer_002.pdf ''The Development of American Medical Education from the Turn of the Century to the Era of Managed Care''] . Accessed July 8, 2007</ref> It was the first medical school to require its students to have an undergraduate degree and was also the first graduate-level medical school to admit women on an equal basis as men. [[Mary Garrett|Mary Elizabeth Garrett]], head of the Women's Medical School Fund, was a driving force behind both of these ''firsts''. School founder Sir [[William Osler]] became the first professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins and the physician-in-chief at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Osler was responsible for establishing the [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] system of postgraduate medical training, where young physicians were required to "reside" within the hospital to better care for their patients.

==The colleges==

Upon matriculation, medical students at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine are divided into four Colleges named after famous Hopkins faculty members who have had a major impact in the history of medicine ([[Florence Sabin]], [[Vivien Thomas]], [[Daniel Nathans]] and [[Helen Taussig]]). The Colleges were established to "foster camaraderie, networking, advising, mentoring, professionalism, clinical skills, and scholarship."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=RW|last2=Barker|first2=AR|last3=Shochet|first3=RB|last4=Wright|first4=SM|title=The new and improved learning community at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine resembles that at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|journal=Medical teacher|volume=29|issue=4|pages=353–7|year=2007|pmid=17786750|doi=10.1080/01421590701477423}}</ref> Students are assigned to faculty advisors within their colleges. Each advisor has a group of five students from each of the four years. They instruct these same five students in 'Clinical Skills', a core first-year course, and continue advising them throughout their 4 years of medical school. Every year, the Colleges compete in the “College Olympics.”
