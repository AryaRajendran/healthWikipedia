The '''Luer taper''' is a [[standardization|standardized]] system of small-scale fluid [[Piping and plumbing fittings|fitting]]s used for making leak-free connections between a male-[[taper]] fitting and its mating female part on medical and laboratory instruments, including [[hypodermic needle|hypodermic]] [[syringe]] tips and needles or [[stopcock]]s and needles. Named after the 19th century German medical instrument maker [[Hermann WÃ¼lfing Luer]], it originated as a 6% taper fitting for glass bottle stoppers. Key features of Luer Taper connectors are defined in the [[International Standards Organization|ISO]] 594 standards.<ref>ISO 594:1986 "Conical fittings with a 6&nbsp;% (Luer) taper for syringes, needles and certain other medical equipment". [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4693]</ref> It is also defined in the [[DIN]] and [[European standard|EN]] standard 1707:1996<ref>[[DIN]] and [[European standard|EN]] standard 1707:1996 "Conical fittings with a 6&nbsp;% (Luer) taper for syringes, needles and certain other medical equipment - Lock fittings".</ref> and 20594-1:1993.<ref>[[DIN]] and [[European standard|EN]] 20594-1:1993 "Conical fittings with a 6&nbsp;% (Luer) taper for syringes, needles and certain other medical equipment described".</ref>

==Variants==
There are two varieties of Luer Taper connections: Luer-Lock and Luer-Slip.<ref>Ravin A. (1952) A Luer slip with a rotating lock. ''J. Lab Clin. Med.'' '''39(1)''', S. 168 PMID 14889106.</ref> Luer-Lock fittings are securely joined by means of a tabbed hub on the female fitting which screws into threads in a sleeve on the male fitting.  The Luer-Lok fitting was developed in the United States by [[Fairleigh S. Dickinson]].  

Luer-Slip fittings simply conform to Luer taper dimensions and are pressed together and held by friction (they have no threads). Luer components are manufactured either from metal or plastic and are available from many companies worldwide.

"Luer-Lock" and "Luer-Slip" are registered trademarks of [[Becton Dickinson]].  "Luer-Lok" style connectors are often generically referred to as  "Luer lock".
