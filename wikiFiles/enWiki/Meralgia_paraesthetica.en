'''Meralgia paresthetica''' or '''Meralgia paraesthetica''' (UK/Australian spelling) (me-ral'-gee-a par-es-thet'-i-ka) (or '''[[Martin Bernhardt|Bernhardt]]-[[Vladimir Karlovich Roth|Roth]] syndrome'''<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2005.072363 |title=Meralgia paraesthetica (Bernhardt-Roth syndrome) |year=2006 |last1=Pearce |first1=J M S |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=77 |pages=84}}</ref>), is numbness or pain in the outer thigh not caused by injury to the thigh, but by injury to a [[nerve]] that extends from the [[thigh]] to the [[spinal column]].  

This [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[neurological disorder]] involves a single nerve—the ''[[lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh]]'' (also called the ''lateral femoral cutaneous nerve'' or ''lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy''<ref>IASP, [http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Classification_of_Chronic_Pain&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=16282  XXXI: LOCAL SYNDROMES IN THE LEG OR FOOT: PAIN OF NEUROLOGICAL ORIGIN], 2012</ref>).  The term ''meralgia paraesthetica'' combines four [[Greek language|Greek]] roots to mean ''thigh pain with anomalous perception''.

== Etiology ==
[[Image:Gray546-LFC.png|thumb|right|[[Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh]] and other structures passing between the left inguinal ligament and ilium, top view.]]
The [[lateral femoral cutaneous nerve]] most often becomes injured by entrapment or compression where it passes between the upper front hip bone ([[Ilium (bone)|ilium]]) and the [[inguinal ligament]] near the attachment at the [[anterior superior iliac spine]] (the upper point of the hip bone).  Less commonly, the nerve may be entrapped by other anatomical or abnormal structures, or damaged by [[diabetic neuropathy|diabetic]] or other [[neuropathy]] or trauma such as from [[seat belt]] injury in an accident.

The nerve may become painful over a period of time as weight gain makes underwear, belting or the waistband of pants gradually exert higher levels of pressure. Pain may be acute and radiate into the rib cage, and into the groin, thigh, and knee. Alternately, weight loss or aging may remove protective fat layers under the skin, so the nerve can compress against underwear, outer clothing, and—most commonly— by belting. Long periods of standing or leg exercise that increases tension on the inguinal ligament may also cause pressure.

== Signs and symptoms ==
* [[Pain]] on the outer side of the thigh, occasionally extending to the outer side of the knee, usually constant.
* A burning sensation, tingling, or [[numbness]] in the same area
* Multiple bee-sting like pains in the affected area
* Occasionally, aching in the groin area or pain spreading across the [[buttocks]]
* Usually more sensitive to light touch than to firm pressure
* Hyper sensitivity to heat (warm water from shower feels like it is burning the area)

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is largely based on patient  description and relevant details about recent surgeries, hip injuries, or repetitive activities that could irritate the nerve. Examination checks for sensory differences between the affected leg and the other leg. Accurate diagnosis may require an abdominal and [[pelvic examination]] to exclude problems in those areas.

[[Electromyography]] (EMG) nerve conduction studies may be required.  X-rays may be needed to exclude bone abnormalities that might put pressure on the nerve; likewise CT or MRI scans to exclude soft tissue causes such as a tumor.

== Treatment ==
Treatment varies. In most cases, the best treatment is to remove the cause of compression by modifying patient behavior, in combination with medical treatment to relieve inflammation and pain. Whatever the cause, typical treatment takes several weeks to months—depending on the degree of nerve damage. Typical treatment options include:
* Wearing looser clothing and suspenders rather than belts
*[[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammatory pain
*[[Narcotic]] pain killers if pain level limits motion and prevents sleep
* Reducing physical activity in relation to pain level. Acute pain may require absolute bed rest

The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh can occasionally be damaged during [[Laparoscopy|laparoscopic]] [[hernia repair]], or scarring from the operation can lead to meralgia paraesthetica.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000658-200008000-00019 |title=Meralgia Paresthetica, the Elusive Diagnosis |year=2000 |last1=Ivins |first1=Gregory K. |journal=Annals of Surgery |volume=232 |issue=2 |pages=281–6 |pmid=10903608 |pmc=1421141}}</ref>

For lower pain levels, treatment may involve having the patient:

* Use rest periods to interrupt long periods of standing, walking, cycling, or other aggravating activity
* Lose weight, and exercise to strengthen abdominal muscles<ref name="UCLA">{{cite web | title=Meralgia Paresthetica | work=Peripheral Nerve Diseases & Disorders | url=http://neurosurgery.ucla.edu/Diagnoses/PeripheralNerve//PeripheralNerveDis_3.html | publisher=UCLA Neurosurgery | accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref>
* Wear clothing that is loose at the upper front hip area
* Apply heat, ice, or electrical stimulation<ref name="eMedicineOrthop">Meralgia Paresthetica {{eMedicine|orthoped|416}}</ref>
* Take [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory]] medications for 7–10 days<ref name="UCLA"/>

Pain may take significant time (weeks) to stop and, in some cases, numbness persists despite treatment. In severe cases, the physician might perform a local nerve block at the inguinal ligament, using a combination of local anaesthetic ([[lidocaine]]) and [[corticosteroid]]s to provide relief that may last several weeks. [[Chronic_pain#Pain_modifiers|Pain modifier drugs]] for [[neuralgia|neuralgic pain]] (such as [[amitriptyline]], [[carbamazepine]] or [[gabapentin]]) may be tried,<ref name="eMedicineOrthop"/> but are often not as helpful in the majority of patients.<ref name="eMedicineNeuro">Meralgia Paresthetica {{eMedicine|neuro|590}}</ref>

Persistent and severe cases may require surgery to decompress the nerve<ref name="eMedicineNeuro"/> or, as a last resort, to resect the nerve.<ref name="eMedicineOrthop"/> The latter treatment leaves permanent numbness in the area.
