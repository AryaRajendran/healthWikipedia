The '''Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource''' (IEDB) is a project hosted by scientists at the  La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology (LIAI), with support from the [http://www.niaid.nih.gov/default.htm National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases] (NIAID), a part of the [http://www.nih.gov/default.htm National Institutes of Health] (NIH), and [http://www.hhs.gov/ Department of Health and Human Services] (HHS). The focus is dissemination of immune epitope information to facilitate the generation of new research tools, diagnostic techniques, vaccines and therapeutics. 

The IEDB contains data related to [[antibody]] and [[T cell]] [[epitopes]] for humans, non-human primates, rodents, and other animal species. Curation of data relating to [http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging/list.htm NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens] (including Influenza) and [http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging/default.htm NIAID Emerging and Re-emerging infectious diseases] is of highest priority and is being continuously updated. In addition, epitopes from other [[infectious agents]], [[allergens]] and [[autoantigens]] are being curated. 

The database also contains [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] binding data from a variety of different antigenic sources and immune epitope data from the FIMM (Brusic), [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] Ligand (Hildebrand), TopBank (Sette), and MHC binding (Buus) databases. These databases and their investigators are hereby acknowledged as major contributors to the IEDB.

In addition to the database, the IEDB website hosts an Analysis Resource, which contains a collection of tools to predict and analyze epitopes.
