'''Locked-in syndrome''' is a condition in which a patient is aware and awake but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for the eyes. '''Total locked-in syndrome''' is a version of locked-in syndrome where the eyes are paralyzed, as well.<ref name= "bauer1979varieties">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00313105 | author =Bauer, G. and Gerstenbrand, F. and Rumpl, E. | title= Varieties of the locked-in syndrome | journal= Journal of Neurology | volume =221 |issue=2 |pages=77–91 |year=1979 |pmid=92545}}</ref> The term for this disorder was coined by [[Fred Plum]] and [[Jerome B.

==Presentation==
Locked-in syndrome usually results in [[quadriplegia]] and the inability to [[Manner of articulation|speak]] in otherwise cognitively intact individuals. Those with locked-in syndrome may be able to communicate with others through coded messages by blinking or moving their eyes, which are often not affected by the paralysis. The symptoms are similar to those of [[sleep paralysis]].  Patients who have locked-in syndrome are conscious and aware, with no loss of cognitive function. They can sometimes retain [[proprioception]] and sensation throughout their bodies. Some patients may have the ability to move certain facial muscles, and most often some or all of the extraocular eye muscles. Individuals with the  syndrome lack coordination between breathing and voice.<ref name= "fager" />  This restricts them from producing voluntary sounds, though the [[vocal cords]] are not paralysed.<ref name =fager>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/07434610600650318|last=Fager|first=Susan|coauthors=Beukelman, Karantounis, Jakobs| year= 2006| title = Use of safe-laser access technology to increase head movements in persons with severe motor impairments: a series of case reports| journal= Augmentative and Alternative Communication|volume= 22| issue= 3| pages= 222–29 | pmid= 17114165}}</ref>

==Causes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
[[Image:Gray760.png|thumb|In children, the most common cause is a stroke of the ventral [[pons]].<ref name="pmid19748042">{{cite journal | author= Bruno MA, Schnakers C, Damas F, ''et al.'' |title= Locked-in syndrome in children: report of five cases and review of the literature |journal=Pediatr.

Unlike [[persistent vegetative state]], in which the upper portions of the brain are damaged and the lower portions are spared, locked-in syndrome is caused by damage to specific portions of the lower brain and brainstem, with no damage to the upper brain.

Possible causes of locked-in syndrome include:
* [[Traumatic brain injury]]
* Diseases of the [[circulatory system]]
* Medication overdose
* Damage to nerve cells, particularly destruction of the [[myelin sheath]], caused by disease (e.g. [[central pontine myelinolysis]] secondary to rapid correction of [[hyponatremia]])
* A stroke or brain hemorrhage, usually of the [[basilar artery]]
* [[Multiple Sclerosis]]
* [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (aka Lou Gehrig's disease)

==Treatment==
Neither a standard treatment nor a cure is available. Stimulation of muscle reflexes with electrodes ([[NMES]]) has been known to help patients regain some muscle function. Other courses of treatment are often [[symptomatic]].<ref>{{NINDS|lockedinsyndrome}}</ref> Assistive computer interface technologies, such as [[Dasher (software)|Dasher]] in combination with [[eye tracking]], may be used to help patients communicate. New [[direct brain interface]] mechanisms may provide future remedies; one effort in 2002 allowed a fully locked-in patient to answer yes-or-no questions.<ref>Parker, I., "Reading Minds," The New Yorker, January 20, 2003, 52–63</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.bu.edu/today/2008/10/14/turning-thoughts-words | contribution = Turning Thoughts into Words | first = Chris | last = Berdik | format = Research | publisher = Boston University | title = BU Today | date = October 15, 2008}}.</ref><ref name="Keiper 2006 4–41">{{cite web|last=Keiper|first=Adam|title=The Age of Neuroelectronics|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-age-of-neuroelectronics|publisher=The New Atlantis|pages=4–41|month=Winter|year=2006}}</ref>  Some scientists have reported that they have developed a technique that allows locked-in patients to communicate via sniffing.<ref>{{cite web|title='Locked-In' Patients Can Follow Their Noses | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/07/locked-in-patients-can-follow-th.html | publisher= Science Mag | date=26 Jul 2010 | accessdate=27 Jul 2010}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Extremely rarely does any significant motor function return. The majority of locked-in syndrome patients do not regain motor control, but devices are available to help patients communicate. Within the first four months after its onset, 90% of those with this condition die. However, some people with the condition continue to live much longer,<ref name=esquire1>[http://www.esquire.com/features/unspeakable-odyssey-motionless-boy-1008 The Unspeakable Odyssey of the Motionless Boy] by Joshua Foer, Esquire Magazine, October 2, 2008.</ref> while in exceptional cases, like that of Kerry Pink<ref name=BBCnews>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-10985836 I recovered from locked-in syndrome] BBC Radio 5 Live, reporter: Stephen Nolan, August 16, 2010.</ref> and Kate Allatt,<ref name=BBCnews2>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17363584 Woman's recovery from 'locked-in' syndrome] BBC News, March 14, 2012.</ref> a full spontaneous recovery may be achieved.

==Notable cases==

===Jean-Dominique Bauby===
Parisian journalist [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]] suffered a [[stroke]] in December 1995, and, when he awoke 20 days later, he found his body was almost completely paralyzed; he could control only his left eyelid. By blinking this eye, he slowly dictated one alphabetic character at a time and, in so doing, was able over a great deal of time to write his memoir, ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]''. Three days after it was published in March 1997, Bauby died of [[pneumonia]].<ref name= "titleThe Diving Bell And The Butterfly | The A.V.

Club |accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref> The 2007 film ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)|The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]'' is a screen adaptation of Bauby's memoir. Jean-Dominique was instrumental in forming the ''Association du Locked-In Syndrome'' (ALIS) in [[France]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.alis-asso.fr/ | title = Association du Locked In Syndrome | language = French | location = FR}}</ref>

===Kate Allatt===
Kate Allatt is a mother-of-three from [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]]. She has successfully recovered from locked-in syndrome. Now she runs Fighting Strokes, and devotes her life to assisting those with locked-in syndrome.<ref name=amazing_spirit/>

===Julia Tavalaro===
In 1966, Julia Tavalaro, then aged 32, suffered two strokes and a brain hemorrhage and was sent to Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island, New York. For six years, she was believed to be in a [[vegetative state]]. In 1972, a family member noticed her trying to smile after she heard a joke. After alerting doctors, a speech therapist, Arlene Kratt, discerned cognizance in her eye movements. Kratt and another therapist, Joyce Sabari, were eventually able to convince doctors she was in a locked-in state. After learning to communicate with eye blinks in response to letters being pointed to on an alphabet board, she became a poet and author. Eventually, she gained the ability to move her head enough to touch a switch with her cheek, which operated a motorized wheelchair and a computer. She gained national attention in 1995 when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published her life story. It was republished by ''[[Newsday]]'' on Long Island and in other newspapers across the country. She died in 2003 at the age of 68.<ref name=esquire1/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/21/local/me-tavalaro21|title=Julia Tavalaro, 68; Poet and Author Noted for Defying Severe Paralysis|work=Los Angeles Times|page=B16|date=December 21, 2003}}</ref>

===Rom Houben===
In 1983, [[Rom Houben]] survived a near-fatal car crash and was diagnosed as being in a vegetative state. Twenty-three years later, using "modern brain imaging techniques and equipment", doctors revised his diagnosis to locked-in syndrome.<ref name= "guardian_houben">{{cite news| url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/23/man-trapped-coma-23-years|title= Trapped in his own body for 23 years — the coma victim who screamed unheard| last= Connolly| first= Kate| date= 23 November 2009| location= Berlin | work = The Guardian | location = UK}}</ref>  He was initially reported as communicating by typing into a keyboard with his right hand,<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/11/for_23_years_man_thought_to_be.html| title = For 23 Years Man Thought To Be In Coma Tried To 'Scream', And No One Heard| author= Mark Memmott|work= NPR|date= November 23, 2009}}</ref> though the presence of a [[Facilitated communication|facilitator]] to move his hand attracted sharp criticism and strong doubts that Houben's communications were authentic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/really_this_guy_is_conscious.php | title= Really?

In early 2010, Dr. [[Steven Laureys]], Houben's neurologist, admitted that subsequent tests had demonstrated Houben had not actually been communicating via the facilitator, and ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', which had originally "quoted" many of Houben's facilitated statements, retracted those quotes as being inauthentic.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,677537,00.html |title= Communicating with Those Trapped within Their Brains| author= Manfred Dworschak| location = DE | work= Der Spiegel | date= February 13, 2010}}</ref>  Laureys maintained the [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] data that had led him to diagnose Houben as locked-in still suggested he was conscious.

Houben's case had been thought to call into question the current methods of diagnosing vegetative state and arguments against withholding care from such patients.<ref name="guardian_houben"/><ref>{{Cite journal

In 1993, Graham Miles, originally from [[Sanderstead]], [[London Borough of Croydon]], suffered a [[stroke]] after which he could not move any part of his body except his eyes. His condition improved gradually, to the point that in 2010 he was able to walk with two sticks and drive a car.<ref name = "urlPensioner tells how he beat locked in syndrome after massive stroke - Telegraph">{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7966357/Pensioner-tells-how-he-beat-locked-in-syndrome-after-massive-stroke.html | title = Pensioner tells how he beat "locked in" syndrome after massive stroke | work = The Daily Telegraph | accessdate = 2010-09-03 | location = London | first= Richard | last= Alleyne | date = August 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name = "urlBBC News - Locked-in syndrome man learns to walk again">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-11103527 |title= Locked-in syndrome man learns to walk again | work= News | publisher = The BBC | location = UK |accessdate= 2010-09-03 | date= August 26, 2010}}</ref>

===Christine Waddell===
Christine Waddell is Britain's longest survivor of locked-in syndrome, leaving her in a state of constant paralysis, but awareness. At the age of 26 in April 1997, she fell in her bathroom. She tried to get up but ultimately fell again and lay there for three days&ndash;until a colleague noticed her absence from work and her father broke into her flat. 17 months in the hospital followed before she moved in with her parents. After years of suffering she was given a grant for a computer which allows her to communicate. She is now able to use the internet and to communicate with old friends and others who have locked-in syndrome. She also listens to music and audiobooks, is able to swallow melted chocolate and sometimes has occasional vodka via her feeding tube. She misses most the ability to talk and regrets being unable to eat burgers.<ref name=amazing_spirit>{{cite news|first=Jenna|last=Sloan|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/real_life/4529462/Locked-in-Christine-Waddell-Im-mad-on-Facebook-shopping-50-Shades-of-Grey-and-vodka.html|title=I’m mad on Facebook, shopping, 50 Shades of Grey and I like vodka: Amazing spirit of 'locked-in' Christine Waddell|newspaper=The Sun|date=11 September 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref>

===Tony Quan AKA Tempt One===
[[Tempt One|Tony Quan]], a popular graffiti artist, was diagnosed with the nerve disorder [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] in 2003 eventually leaving him fully paralyzed except for his eyes. Quan uses the technology called [[EyeWriter]] to communicate his art and has since had his work displayed in numerous art shows nationally.<ref>http://gizmodo.com/5403741/eyewriter-allows-man-to-paint-despite-paralysis http://infosthetics.com/archives/2009/11/eyewriter_graffiti_physically_paralyzed.html</ref>

===Erik Ramsey===
In 1999, 16-year-old Erik Ramsey suffered a stroke after a car accident that left him in a locked-in state. His story was profiled in an edition of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine in 2008. Erik is currently working with doctors to develop a new communication system that uses a computer that, through implants in his brain, reads the electronic signals produced when he thinks certain words and sounds. At present, Erik is only able to communicate short and basic sounds. However, doctors believe, within a few years, Erik will be able to use this system to communicate words and phrases, and eventually, to "talk" normally.<ref name=esquire1/><ref>Guenther, F.H., Brumberg, J.S., Wright, E.J., Nieto-Castanon, A., Tourville, J.A., Panko, M., Law, R., Siebert, S.A., Bartels, J.L., Andreasen, D.S., Ehirim, P., Mao, H., and Kennedy, P.R.
