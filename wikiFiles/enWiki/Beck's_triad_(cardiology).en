'''Beck's triad''' is a collection of three [[medical sign]]s associated with acute [[cardiac tamponade]], an [[medical emergency|emergency]] condition wherein fluid accumulates around the [[heart]] and impairs its ability to pump [[blood]]. The signs are [[hypotension|low arterial blood pressure]], distended neck veins, and distant, muffled [[heart sound]]s.<ref name="Sternbach1988">{{cite journal |author=Sternbach G |title=Claude Beck: cardiac compression triads |journal=J Emerg Med |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=417–9 |year=1988 |pmid=3066820 |doi=10.1016/0736-4679(88)90017-0}}</ref> 

Narrowing [[pulse pressure]] might also be observed. The concept was developed by [[Claude Beck]], a resident and later Professor of Cardiovascular Surgery at [[Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine|Case Western Reserve University]].<ref>Case faculty Claude Beck - http://www.hrsonline.org/News/ep-history/notable-figures/claudebeck.cfm</ref>

==Physiology==
The fall in [[arterial blood pressure]] results from pericardial fluid accumulation to a degree that it impairs ventricular stretch, thus reducing [[stroke volume]] , a major determinant of [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] blood pressure.

The rising [[central venous pressure]] is evidenced by [[jugular venous distension|distended jugular veins]] while in a non-[[supine position]].  It is caused by reduced [[diastole|diastolic]] filling of the [[right ventricle]], due to the outside pressure being exerted on it by the expanding [[pericardial sac]].  This results in a backup of fluid into the veins draining into the heart, most notably, the [[jugular vein]]s. In severe [[hypovolemia]], the neck veins may not be distended.

The suppressed [[heart sound]]s occur due to the muffling effects of the sounds passing through the fluid surrounding the heart.

==Clinical use==
Although the full triad is present only in a minority of cases of acute cardiac tamponade,<ref name="Sternbach1988"/> presence of the triad is considered [[pathognomonic]] for the condition.<ref name="Demetriades1986">{{cite journal |author=Demetriades D |title=Cardiac wounds.
