'''Autism friendly''' means being aware of social engagement and environmental factors affecting people on the [[autism spectrum disorder|autism spectrum]], with modifications to communication methods and physical space to better suit individual's unique and special needs.

Individuals on the [[autism spectrum disorder|autism spectrum]] take in information from their five senses as do [[neurotypical]] people. The difference is they are not able to process it as quickly and can become overwhelmed by the amount of information that they are receiving and withdraw as a coping mechanism.<ref>Caldwell, Phoebe and Jane Horwood. (2008). ''Using Intensive Interaction and Sensory Integration: A Handbook for Those Who Support People With Severe Autistic Spectrum Disorder.'' Jessica Kingsley Publishers. p. 16. ISBN 1843106264.</ref> They may experience difficulty in public settings due to inhibited [[communication]], [[social interaction]] or [[Theory of mind|flexibility of thought]] development. Knowing about these differences and how to react effectively helps to create a more inclusive society. It also better suits the needs of the growing number of individuals with [[autism]], [[Asperger syndrome]], or other disorders on the autism spectrum.<ref name=AD-training>[http://www.theautismdirectory.com/awareness-training/ ''Autism Awareness Presentation.''] The Autism Directory. Retrieved September 5, 2012.</ref>

Being autism friendly means being understanding and flexible in interpersonal conversation, public programs and public settings. In the end, working together makes our experiences together better for everyone. For example, a person might think that if someone is being rude if they will not look them in the eyes - or doesn't understand cliches like "it's a piece of cake", when in fact there may be a reason for this. Depending upon the individual's level of functioning, a person who hears "it's a piece of cake" may take that literally and not understand that what is really meant is "it will be easy".<ref name=AD-training/> For someone on the autism spectrum, being in an autism friendly environment means they will be have a manageable degree of sensory stimuli, which will make them calmer, better able to process the sensory stimulation they receive, and better able to relate to others.<ref>Caldwell, Phoebe and Jane Horwood. (2008). ''Using Intensive Interaction and Sensory Integration: A Handbook for Those Who Support People With Severe Autistic Spectrum Disorder.'' Jessica Kingsley Publishers. pp. 15-17. ISBN 1843106264.</ref>

===Communication and social interaction===
Organizations interested in spreading awareness about autism and how to be autism friendly, such as the [[The Autism Directory]], have created training programs for communities to illustrate how people with autism may communicate or interact differently than neurotypical people, or people without autism. There are also suggestions for how to modify one's reaction to improve communication.<ref name=AD-training/> Some training examples are:<ref name=AD-training/>
*When one finds out that someone may not be able to look them in their eyes, one should realize that they are not trying to be rude, and it is uncomfortable for them to do so.
*A person may have difficulty understanding [[clich√©]]s or expressions and interpret a phrase literally. By speaking directly and factually, like saying "It's easy" as compared to "It's a piece of cake", one is more likely to understand the line.
*[[Body language]], [[facial expression]]s, [[gesture]]s, and turning away from someone may be cues that are missed by an autistic person. This is another opportunity to be direct and factual, realizing that your body language or social cues may not be picked up.
*The person may have limited [[vocabulary]] or [[speech perception]]. Patience is helpful here. Allow time for the person to comprehend what was said. Ask how you can help. If they use [[sign language]] or a [[symbol set]] to communicate, adapt as you are able.

Other pointers are: avoid making loud sounds; do not surprise them, let them know your plans; limit or avoid vigorous activities; and talk or engage in activities that they care about.<ref name=AD-training/><ref name=Nguyen5and6/><ref name=Time/>

===Environment===
Some people with autism may be [[Sensory_processing_disorder#Hyposensitivities_and_hypersensitivities|hypersensitive]] to changes in [[Visual perception|sight]], [[touch]], [[Olfaction|smell]], [[taste]] and [[sound]]; The sensory stimulus could be very distracting or they could result in pain or [[anxiety]]. There are other people who are [[Sensory processing disorder#Hyposensitivities and hypersensitivities|hyposensitive]] and may not feel extreme changes in temperature or pain. Each of these has implications for making an autism friendly environment.<ref name=Nguyen3>Nguyen, Anh. (2006). ''Creating an Autism Friendly Environment.'' National Autistic Society. p. 3. ISBN 1899280944.</ref>

====Social factors====
There are several factors in creating a supportive environment. One of them is adherence to a standard routine and structure. Since change of routine can be quite anxiety producing for many autistic people, a structured, predictable routine makes for calmer and happier transitions during the day. Another important factor is creating a low arousal space. Environments with the least amount of disruption will help autistic people remain calm. It's important to speak in quiet, non-disruptive tones and to utilize a physical space that has a low level of disruption. Having a positive, empathetic attitude and ensuring consistent habits in work, school and recreational activities also help to minimize anxiety and distress and help an autistic person succeed. This is the SPELL approach which stand for '''S'''tructure - '''P'''ositive - '''E'''mpathy - '''L'''ow arousal - '''L'''inks.<ref name=Nguyen5and6>Nguyen, Anh. (2006). ''Creating an Autism Friendly Environment.'' National Autistic Society. pp. 5-6. ISBN 1899280944.</ref><ref>[http://www.autism.org.uk/SPELL ''SPELL.''] [[National Autistic Society]], United Kingdom.

Retrieved September 8, 2012.</ref>

====Physical space====
[[File:Ty Nant, Ringland Circle, Newport - geograph.org.uk - 1592795.jpg|thumb|Newport Ty Nant uses modern SMART technology, autism-friendly design features and an autism-specific model of care to allow tenants to have more control over their lives.]]
There are several ways that the physical space can be designed and organized to be autism friendly. It is important for rooms to be decorated with serenity in mind, like painting the walls with calming colors. Thick carpeting and double-paned glass help to minimize distracting noise. Materials within the rooms may be organized, grouped and labeled with words or symbols to make items easier to locate.<ref>Nguyen, Anh. (2006). ''Creating an Autism Friendly Environment.'' National Autistic Society. p. 7. ISBN 1899280944.</ref>

==Topics==

===Daily life===
Autism friendliness can have a significant impact on an individual's interpersonal life and work life, benefited by consistency across all areas of one's life.<ref name=Nguyen5and6/>

====Vacations====
Due to the break of routine with family vacations, many families may avoid taking vacations. Steps can be taken to help make for a successful family vacation. One is sharing information like pictures or internet web pages. There are organizations that will make accommodations, if requested, to better manage uncertainty, crowds, noise disruption. This includes theme parks who allow people with autism to skip long lines and airlines or airports that may allow for a dry-run prior to the trip. Another tip is to prepare prior to the trip so that there is a plan for managing boredom.<ref name=Time>[http://time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1893554,00.html ''Six Tips for Traveling with an Autistic Child.''] Time.

===Entertainment===

====Theatre====
<!---- please don't change the heading, links are made to this page and section with Autism friendly#theatre ---->
In the United States, the [[Theatre Development Fund]] (TDF) created a program in 2011 to "make theatre accessible to children and adults on the autism spectrum". Called the Autism Theatre Initiative, it's part of their Accessibility Programs, and was done in conjunction with [[Autism Speaks]], [[Disney]] and experts who reviewed the performance for areas of modification. Adjustments that have been name for the initiative include: quiet areas in theatre lobby, performance changes that reduced strobe light use and noise, and areas where people can go perform an activity if they leave the theatre. [[Social stories]], which explain what the experience will be like (such as loud noises, needing a break and moving through a crowd), were made available prior to the performance. [http://www.atgtickets.com/blog/why-access-is-important/ These performances] included ''[[Lion King]]'' and ''[[Mary Poppins]]''.<ref>Piepenberg, Erik. (August 31, 2011). [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/program-hopes-to-make-broadway-friendlier-to-those-with-autism/ "Program Hopes to Make Broadway Friendlier to Those With Autism."] ''The New York Times''.

====Movie cinema====
Going to a movie theater can be an overwhelming experience for someone on the autism spectrum. Crowding as people queue up to buy tickets. Loud movie volume. Dark theater lighting. All of these are sensory overload triggers that have kept some autistic people from ever seeing a movie at the cinema. Some movie theaters are becoming more autism friendly: The lighting is adjusted so it's not so dark, the volume is reduced and queues are managed to prevent crowding. [[Odeon Cinemas]] in [[London]] has implemented such "sensory friendly" nights.<ref>Roxby, Philippa and Sophie van Brugen. (August 12, 2011). [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14494676 ''Autism-friendly film gets people relaxed about cinema.''] BBC. Retrieved September 6, 2012.</ref> On September 16, 2012, as one example, the [[Odeon Cinemas]] will screen ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', a [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] animated movie, at more than 80 United Kingdom and Ireland cinemas for people desiring a sensory friendly movie going experience.<ref>[http://www.dimensions-uk.org/autismfilms/ ''Autism Friendly Film Screening of Brave - at over 80 participating cinemas.''] Dimensions. Retrieved September 6, 2012.</ref>

In the United States there are also "sensory friendly" movie-going experiences to be had through collaboration with the [[Autism Society of America]]. Monthly, [[AMC Theatres]] (AMC) will provide nights when people on the autism spectrum and their families may experience an autism friendly movie night. The program is also intended for people with other disabilities whose movie going experience will also be improved in such a setting.<ref>[http://www.autism-society.org/get-involved/events/sensory-friendly-films/ ''Sensory Friendly Films.''] Autism Society.

===Education===
Providing the best outcomes for a child on the autism spectrum may be difficult, complicated by each child's unique way of managing communication and interaction with others, associated disorders that make each child's situation unique, and emerging understandings of [[neurodiversity]]. Teacher effectiveness can be optimized based upon their awareness of the differences along the autism spectrum, acceptance that each child is unique, engagement of the child in social and educational activities and employment of teaching methods that are found to be helpful with people with developmental disability.<ref>Carol Gray. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=tv2DrZRmHVoC&pg=PA35 Learners on the Autism Spectrum: Preparing Highly Qualified Educators]''. AAPC Publishing; 1 May 2008 [cited 17 September 2012]. ISBN 978-1-934575-07-9. p. 35‚Äì.</ref>

Teachers play a key role in the success of a student on the autism spectrum by helping them to understand directions, organize tasks and support their achievements. One example is organizing and grouping materials together for activities in specific ways.<ref>Breitenbach, Marlene. (2008). ''Basic Skills Checklists: Teacher-Friendly Assessment for Students with Autism or Special Needs.'' Future Horizons. ISBN 1932565752.</ref>

Schools dedicated to being autism friendly, like [[Pathlight School]] in [[Singapore]], designed their campus to offer students "dignity" in an autism-friendly environment. There the campus was architecturally designed, landscaped and the interior created with a simple color scheme. All of this helps to avoid triggering [[sensory overload]]. There is a low teacher to student ratio, a focus on nurturing, and a comprehensive life-skills training and education program.<ref>[http://www.autism.org.sg/press/2010/0901-a_unified_whole-d+a.pdf ''A Unified Whole.''] d+a magazine. Issue 53, 2010.</ref>

====Empathizing-systemizing theory====
[[Empathizing-systemizing theory]] with video technology can be used to present information in an autism friendly way that promotes understanding. For instance, computer applications or DVDs of actors making facial expressions to inform how body language provides clues about how someone might be feeling. Or, in the case of ''[[The Transporters]]'', interesting items like trains are used to wear faces, drawing in the viewer into the faces.<ref>Eric Hollander; Alex Kolevzon; Joseph T. Coyle. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=NgEg2FqxrYYC&pg=PA45 Textbook of Autism Spectrum Disorders]''. American Psychiatric Pub; 18 October 2010 [cited 17 September 2012]. ISBN 978-1-58562-341-9. p. 45.</ref>

===Justice and law===
Being met with an individual in a dark uniform can be intimidating to a person with autism, particularly when they have been a [[Victimology|crime victim]] or are injured. Police and emergency responders may become frustrated, not knowing a person that they're talking to is autistic. The responders may not be communicating in a way that will create understanding and make the situation less stressful. A program has been launched in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] to enter information into a database about autistic people so that responding police and emergency personnel are notified when they will be meeting an autistic person and may then communicate in a way that increases understanding and makes the situation less stressful.<ref>[http://www.autism.org.uk/news-and-events/news-archive/5-may/landmark-pilot-project-to-better-protect-glaswegians-with-autism.aspx ''Landmark pilot project to 'better protect' Glaswegians with autism.''] The [[National Autistic Society]]. Retrieved September 7, 2012.</ref><ref name=NAS-Cards/> Autism Alert Cards, for example, are available for autistic people in [[Scottish Borders]] and [[Lothian]] [[Scotland]] so that police and emergency personnel will  recognize autistic individuals and respond appropriately. The cards, which encourage autism friendly interaction, have a couple of key points about interacting with people with autism.<ref name=NAS-Cards>[http://www.autism.org.uk/news-and-events/news-archive/1-january/autism-alert-card-launches-in-lothian-and-borders.aspx ''Autism Alert Card launches in Lothian and Borders.''] The National Austic Society. Retrieved September 7, 2012.</ref>

===Life events===
"[[Neurotypical]]" people and those on the autism spectrum may have very different ways of communicating their feeling about life events, including:
* Coping with [[illness]], [[injury]] and [[recuperation (recovery)|recuperation]]
* Dealing with dying and [[death]]
* Incorporating [[ritual]]s and [[tradition]]s for managing life events
* Managing [[emotion]]s
* Learning from life events<ref>Fahrety, Catherine (author) and [[Gary B. Mesibov]], PH.D. (contributor). (2008). ''Understanding Death and Illness and What They Teach about Life: An Interactive Guide for Individuals with Autism or Asperger's and Their Loved Ones''. Future Horizons.  pp. viii - xiv, xxvi. ISBN 1932565566.</ref>

Just because people may process and communicate their feelings differently, though, doesn't mean it's right or wrong. It is best to be honest and literal to help a person with autism to manage major life events. Providing information, and allowing them time to process it, are other important factors. Lastly, communication tools will also help to process and manage the event.<ref>Fahrety, Catherine (author) and Gary B Mesibov, PH.D. (contributor). (2008). ''Understanding Death and Illness and What They Teach about Life: An Interactive Guide for Individuals with Autism or Asperger's and Their Loved Ones''. Future Horizons.  p. xxviii. ISBN 1932565566.</ref>

People on the autism spectrum can help themselves manage situations by being aware of what they're feeling and thinking ‚Äî and expressing their thoughts to important people in their life. Other tools are being aware of when they need help and asking for it ‚Äî and thanking people when they've received assistance or a gift.<ref>Fahrety, Catherine (author) and Gary B Mesibov, PH.D. (contributor). (2008). ''Understanding Death and Illness and What They Teach about Life: An Interactive Guide for Individuals with Autism or Asperger's and Their Loved Ones''. Future Horizons.  p. xxviiii. ISBN 1932565566.</ref>

===Technology===
Educational technological applications for people with [[autism]] include:

====Digital talking books====
[[DAISY Digital Talking Book|Digital talking books]] are used to assist people with disabilities, commonly people who are blind, and also for people with autism. One such use is for taped church programs.<ref>[http://www.lds.org/church/news/updated-talking-book-program-benefits-church-members-with-disabilities?lang=eng ''Updated Talking Book Program Benefits Church Members with Disabilities.''] The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints. Retrieved September 8, 2012.</ref>

====Mobile applications====
* One of the providers of autism-friendly applications is iPad, which was an interface between the child and the storyteller on a video. By repeating what the narrator says, the children hear themselves tell the story, like ''Tom the Talking Cat.'' Reading the stories aloud helps children improve their language and communication skills, as well as improving fine motor skills, social skills and sensory skills.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/18/ipad-apps-for-autism-and-_n_686020.html "iPad Apps That Help Autistic Children's Development."] ''Huffington Post. November 17, 2011.</ref>
* Apple iPod applications can be used by people on the autism spectrum to manage tasks at work. It can manage a checklist of tasks and reminder prompts. This helps a person be more calm and effective and rely less on managers or job coaches to prompt for needed work. Tony Gentry, who led research on the applicatin at Virginia Commonwealth University said: "This is an exciting time for anyone in the fields of education, physical rehabilitation, and vocational support, where we are seeing a long-awaited merging of consumer products and assistive technologies for all."<ref>Heasley, Susan.

====Motion-controlled gadgets====

====Social media====

====Types of technology====
* [[Emotion Markup Language]] is a general-purpose [[emotion]] annotation and representation language, which should be usable in a large variety of technological contexts where emotions need to be represented. Emotion-oriented computing (or "[[affective computing]]") is gaining importance as [[interactivity|interactive]] technological systems become more sophisticated. For people on the autism spectrum, it can be used to make the emotional intent of content explicit. This would enable people with [[learning disabilities]] (such as [[Asperger's Syndrome]]) to realise the emotional context of the content.

===Training for businesses===
As the prevalence of autism increases, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that customer-facing organizations have basic tools for communicating with people on the autism spectrum. [[Tesco]], a multinational supermarket chain, has implemented training for its employees to meet the needs of its customers who are on the autism spectrum, which is estimated to be one of every 100 people in the United Kingdom. Employees use an online training site and respond to a questionnaire to assess the extent to which they became more aware of [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD). Tesco is the first company to participate in an awareness program led by the [[Welsh Local Government Association]] (WLGA). The online training and questionnaire tool is intended to be used by many organizations in [[Wales]] to identify and commend businesses that are "ASD Aware".<ref>[http://www.wlga.gov.uk/english/media-centre/supermarket-giant-tesco-signs-up-to-wlga-asd-aware-scheme/ ''Supermarket Giant Tesco signs up to WLGA ASD Aware Scheme.''] Welsh Local Government Association.
