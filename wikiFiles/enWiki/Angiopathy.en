'''Angiopathy''' is the generic term for a disease of the [[blood vessel]]s ([[artery|arteries]], [[vein]]s, and [[capillary|capillaries]]).<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000005089|angiopathy}}</ref> The best known and most prevalent angiopathy is '''diabetic angiopathy''', a common [[complication (medicine)|complication]] of [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[diabetes]]. 

==Classification==
===By caliber===
There are two types of angiopathy: '''[[macroangiopathy]]''' and '''[[microangiopathy]]'''.
 
In macroangiopathy, [[atherosclerosis]] and a resultant [[blood]] [[clot]] forms on the large blood vessels, sticks to the vessel walls, and blocks the flow of [[blood]]. Macroangiopathy may cause other complications, such as [[ischemic heart disease]], [[stroke]] and peripheral vascular disease which contributes to the diabetic [[foot ulcers]] and the risk of amputation.

In microangiopathy, the walls of the smaller blood vessels become so thick and weak that they [[hemorrhage|bleed]], leak [[protein]], and slow the flow of blood through the body.  The decrease of blood flow through [[stenosis]] or clot formation impairs the flow of [[oxygen]] to [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and [[biological tissue]]s (called [[ischemia]]) and leads to cellular death ([[necrosis]] and [[gangrene]], which in turn may require [[amputation]]). Thus, tissues which are very sensitive to oxygen levels, such as the [[retina]], develop microangiopathy and may cause [[blindness]] (so-called proliferative diabetic [[retinopathy]]). Damage to [[nerve]] cells may cause peripheral [[neuropathy]], and to [[kidney]] cells, diabetic [[nephropathy]] ([[Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome]]).

===By condition===
It is also possible to classify angiopathy by the associated condition:
* [[Diabetic angiopathy]]
*[[Congophilic angiopathy]]
