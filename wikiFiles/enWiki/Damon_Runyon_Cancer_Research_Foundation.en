The '''Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation''' ('''Damon Runyon''') is a not-for-profit [[cancer research]] organization focused on "discovering the talent to discover the cure."<ref name=mission/> The Foundation states that its goals are to: "identify the best and brightest early career scientists in cancer research, accelerate the translation of scientific discoveries into new diagnostic tools and treatments, and to enable risk-taking on bold new ideas."<ref name=mission/>

The Foundation was founded in 1946 by media personality [[Walter Winchell]] in [[New York City]] under the name ''Damon Runyon Cancer Memorial Fund'' in memory of his colleague and friend [[Damon Runyon]].

==History==
Almost immediately after Runyon's passing on December 10, 1946, Winchell went on the air and asked his audience for contributions to [[cancer]] research.  
<blockquote>
"Mr. and Mrs. United States!  A very dear friend of mine - a great newspaperman, a great writer, and a very great guy - Damon Runyon, was killed this week by America's Number Two killer - Cancer.  It's time we tried to do something to fight this terrible disease.  We must fight back, and together we can do it.  Won't you send me a penny, a nickel, a dime, or a dollar?  All of your money will go directly to the cancer fighters, in Damon Runyon's name.  There will be no expenses of any kind deducted."<ref>{{cite book

The organization gained more notoriety in 1949 when [[Milton Berle]], a long-time friend of both Runyon and Winchell, hosted the first-ever [[telethon]], raising $1,100,000 for the Foundation over 16 hours.<ref>{{cite book
