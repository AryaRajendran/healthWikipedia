{{Autism cure movement}}
'''Generation Rescue''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] that advocates the view that [[autism]] and related disorders are primarily caused by environmental factors,<ref name=grhome>{{cite web |url=http://generationrescue.org |accessdate=2009-05-08 |title=Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey's autism organization – Generation Rescue}}</ref> particularly [[vaccine]]s.<ref name=GR-vaccines/> These claims are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.<ref name=vaccines-and-autism/> The group gained widespread attention through use of an aggressive media campaign, including sponsoring full page ads in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]''.<ref name="USAToday2"/> Today, Generation Rescue is known as a platform for [[Jenny McCarthy]]'s autism and anti-vaccine advocacy.<ref name=Coombes/>

==Media campaign==
The organization was established in 2005 by Lisa and J.B. Handley and 150 volunteer "Rescue Angels" that included many members of the biomedical treatment movement at the time. Beginning in the spring of 2005 and running through January 2007, Generation Rescue began a national media campaign in the US, placing advertisements in such publications as ''[[USA Today]]''.<ref name="USAToday2">[http://www.generationrescue.org/images/060406.gif Ad in ''USA Today'', April 6, 2006: unveiled the new website, PutChildrenFirst.org]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> More recently it has been fronted by [[Jenny McCarthy]], an author, television personality and former ''[[Playboy]]'' model.<ref name=Coombes>{{cite journal |author=Coombes R |title=Vaccine disputes |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |issue= |pages=b2435 |year=2009 |pmid=19546136 |doi=10.1136/bmj.b2435 |url=http://www.theoneclickgroup.co.uk/documents/vaccines/Vaccine%20disputes,%20BMJ.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-11-08}}</ref> [[Jim Carrey]], during his relationship with McCarthy, also promoted Generation Rescue.

==Causes of autism==
Generation Rescue believes that autism and other developmental issues are caused by environmental factors. Its members primarily blame vaccines, the increase in the number of vaccines administered,<ref name=GR-vaccines>{{cite web |url=http://generationrescue.org/vaccines.html |title=About vaccines |publisher=Generation Rescue |accessdate=2009-10-26 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and [[thiomersal]], a [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-based vaccine preservative.<ref name=GR-mercury>{{cite web |url=http://generationrescue.org/isit.html |title=Is it the mercury? |publisher=Generation Rescue |accessdate=2009-10-26 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Generation Rescue claims that [[Biomedical intervention for autism|biomedical intervention]] can help children recover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://generationrescue.org/biomedical.html |title=Treatment: what's biomedical treatment? |publisher=Generation Rescue |accessdate=2009-10-26 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The hypotheses that vaccines, such as [[MMR vaccine controversy|MMR]], or [[Thiomersal controversy|thiomersal]] cause autism are not supported by scientific evidence,<ref name=vaccines-and-autism>Vaccines and autism:

It maintains three websites, Generation Rescue<ref name=grhome/> Fourteen Studies.org, and PutChildrenFirst.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.putchildrenfirst.org |accessdate=2007-08-20 |date=2006-11-12 |title=PutChildrenFirst.org}}</ref> Generation Rescue details the organization’s points of view described above. PutChildrenFirst alleges a cover-up by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] concerning the role that vaccines have played in [[Epidemiology of autism#Changes with time|recent increases in the number of reported autism cases]].

==Criticisms==
===Lack of peer-reviewed research===
Generation Rescue bases much of their case on publications that do not go through a proper [[peer review]] process. In particular, an article Generation Rescue publishes in its website, "Autism: A Novel Form of Mercury Poisoning"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bernard S, Enayati A, Redwood L, Roger H, Binstock T |title=Autism: a novel form of mercury poisoning |journal=Med Hypotheses |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=462–71 |year=2001 |pmid=11339848 |doi=10.1054/mehy.2000.1281 |url=http://generationrescue.org/pdf/bernard.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-11-27 }}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> appeared in ''[[Medical Hypotheses]]'', a journal without scientific peer review; the hypothesis has not been confirmed by credible scientific evidence.<ref name=vaccines-and-autism/>

According to the ''BMJ'', the implication that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism "relied on parental recall and beliefs &hellip; epidemiological studies consistently found no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. By the time the paper was finally retracted 12 years later, after forensic dissection at the General Medical Council's (GMC) longest ever fitness to practise hearing, few people could deny that it was fatally flawed both scientifically and ethically."<ref name=WakefieldarticleBMJ/>

===Promotion of quack treatments===

Generation Rescue co-sponsors an annual conference at the [[Westin Hotels|Westin Hotel]] in [[Chicago]] along with another charity, Autism One.<ref>[http://www.autismone.org/content/autismone-generation-rescue-conference-2012 AutismOne / Generation Rescue Conference 2012], AutismOne.org, May 2012</ref> The choice of speakers at these conferences have led critics to accuse both organizations of promoting unproven therapies and harmful [[quackery]].

Generation Rescue and Autism One were criticized for including [[self-employed]] [[Maryland]] physician [[Mark Geier]] in their 2011 conference, despite the Maryland State Board of Physicians having suspended Geier's [[medical license]].<ref>[http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/06/autismone-throws-their-support-behind-the-geiers-in-autism-science-digest/ AutismOne throws their support behind the Geiers in “Autism Science Digest”], LeftBrainRightBrain.co.uk, 16 June 2011</ref> The board stated that Geier "endangers autistic children and exploits their parents by administering to the children a treatment protocol that has a known substantial risk of serious harm and which is neither consistent with evidence-based medicine nor generally accepted in the relevant scientific community."<ref>[https://www.mbp.state.md.us/bpqapp/Orders/D2425004.271.PDF Board order]</ref> The board ruled that Geier misdiagnosed patients, diagnosed patients without sufficient tests, and recommended  treatments without fully explaining the risks to parents. The board also ruled that Geier misrepresented his credentials, including during an interview before the panel. Geier lost his medical licenses in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Virginia]], and [[California]] shortly thereafter; he has also seen his licenses revoked and/or suspended in [[Florida]] and [[Indiana]].

One of the speakers at the 2012 conference was Kerri Rivera, the proprietor of an autism treatment clinic in [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]]. Rivera hosted a presentation promoting the [[Miracle Mineral Supplement|Miracle Mineral Solution]], or MMS, a liquid product containing [[chlorine dioxide]] that she claimed had cured thirty-eight children of autism.<ref>[http://www.autismone.org/content/38-children-recovered-20-months-autism-treatment-mms 38 Children Recovered in 20 months: Autism Treatment with MMS], AutismOne.org, 27 May 2012</ref> Several bloggers criticized the presentation, noting that MMS consists of the same chemical compound as industrial strength [[bleach]] and was thus potentially harmful to children being given the product, both orally and through [[enema]]s.<ref>[http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/bleaching-away-what-ails-you/ Bleaching away what ails you], ScienceBasedMedicine.org, 28 May 2012</ref><ref>[http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2012/05/mms-or-how-to-cure-autism-with-bleach-brought-to-you-by-autismone/ MMS, or how to cure autism with bleach. Brought to you by AutismOne], LeftBrainRightBrain.co.uk, 29 May 2012</ref> MMS has been subject to a warning by the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and by government health agencies in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Belgium]]; MMS was banned outright in [[Canada]] in February 2012.<ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2012/2012_21-eng.php Sodium Chlorite Solution Not Authorized for Oral Consumption by Humans], Health Canada, 15 February 2012</ref>

=== Disassociation of cited researchers ===
Generation Rescue's second ''New York Times'' advertisement had to undergo one alteration due to one scientist who asked to be removed from the ad. Also, after the ad ran, several of the scientists thanked in the ad wanted to disassociate their work from the mercury/autism connection. This group of scientists wrote: "we believe Generation Rescue’s advertisement, at first appearance an innocuous gesture of appreciation, may actually mislead the public into thinking that the mercury–autism hypothesis has stronger support in the scientific literature than it actually does."<ref>{{cite web |title=General confusion and the NYT |url=http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2005/11/general-confusion-and-nyt.html |work=Autism Diva |date=2005-11-25 |accessdate=2009-11-27 }}</ref>

=== Misleading claims ===
Generation Rescue has asserted that countries that require fewer infant vaccines have lower infant mortality rates. However, this has been criticized as "rhetorical sleight of hand": in the U.S., a country that requires more vaccines than most, the infant mortality rate declined 50% from 1966 to 1981, during which the number of vaccines increased.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Fraser Forum |author=Katz D |title=The missing link between vaccines and autism |year=2009 |issue=07/09 |pages=22–5 |url=http://fraseramerica.org/commerce.web/product_files/MissingLinkBetweenVaccinesAndAutism_US.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref>
