WHO-2004 assigns primary lung cancers to one of five groups according to the putative lineage of their cell of origin:<ref name='who2004' />

* Epithelial tumors ([[carcinoma]])
* Mesenchymal tumors ([[sarcoma]])
* Hematopoietic tumors ([[lymphoma]])
* Germ cell tumors ([[teratoma]])
* Melanocytic tumors ([[melanoma]])

Approximately 98% of lung cancers are [[carcinoma]].<ref name='TravisTravis'>{{cite journal |author=Travis WD, Travis LB, Devesa SS |title=Lung cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=75 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=191–202 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=8000996 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<191::AID-CNCR2820751307>3.0.CO;2-Y }}</ref> Primary lung sarcomas, lymphomas, teratomas, and melanomas are all rare, with a relative incidence of 1% or less each among all primary lung cancers.<ref name="TravisTravis"/>

WHO-2004 recognizes 8 major types of primary lung carcinoma based on cytological and tissue architectural characteristics. Of these, four are relatively common and four are relatively rare:<ref name='who2004' />

*Common Lung Carcinomas
** [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|Squamous Cell Carcinoma]]  {{space|1}}(35% of lung cancers)
** [[Adenocarcinoma of the lung|Adenocarcinoma]]  {{space|17}}(35% of lung cancers)
** [[Small-cell carcinoma|Small Cell Carcinoma]]  {{space|9}}(15% of lung cancers)
** [[Large-cell lung carcinoma|Large Cell Carcinoma]]  {{space|9}}(10% of lung cancers)

*Rare Lung Carcinomas
** [[Adenosquamous lung carcinoma|Adenosquamous Carcinoma]]  {{space|3}}(2–3% of lung cancers)
** [[Carcinoid|Carcinoid Tumor]]  {{space|23}}(2–3% of lung cancers)
** [[Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung|Sarcomatoid Carcinoma]]  {{space|10}}(<1% of lung cancers)
** [[Salivary gland–like carcinoma of the lung|Salivary Gland-like Carcinoma]]  (<1% of lung cancers)

With the exception of adenosquamous carcinoma – itself comprising a spectrum of composite tumors containing components of at least 10% each of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma — each of the major histological types of lung carcinoma encompasses at least one "subtype" and/or "variant" form.<ref name='who2004' /> This exceptional histological heterogeneity is thought to reflect the great diversity of mutations due to oncogenetic insults and their effects on the molecular pathways that initiate, drive, and maintain malignant phenotypes.<ref name="BermanReconcile"/>

Some experts have recently advocated the use of histotype to identify variants of NSCLC into "better" and "worse" prognosis groups, and suggested tailoring aggressiveness of therapy on this basis.<ref name="RossiMarchioni"/>

It was not until 1962 that [[small cell lung carcinoma]] (SCLC), then called [[small cell lung carcinoma|"oat cell carcinoma"]] was recognized for its unique biological behavior, including a much higher frequency of widespread metastases at presentation, and exquisite sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation.<ref name='WatkinGreen'/><ref name='WatsonBerg'>{{cite journal |author=Watson WL, Berg JW |title=Oat cell lung cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=15 |pages=759–68 |year=1962 |pmid=14005321 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(196207/08)15:4<759::AID-CNCR2820150410>3.0.CO;2-6 |issue=4 }}</ref>

It is estimated that approximately 80% of lung cancer patients in the U.S. have non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), while approximately 12% have "pure" small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC).

Although controversial, the traditional dichotomous stratification paradigm that has long divided patients with lung carcinoma into NSCLC and SCLC groups for treatment purposes is increasingly being replaced by a "higher order histomolecular stratification" ([[HOHMS]]) paradigm that recognizes and incorporates newly discovered associations between particular histologic subtypes of lung cancer and molecular oncogenetic mutations and pathways driving their malignant phenotypes.<ref name="RosaiHOHMSArticle"/>

==Adenosquamous Carcinomas==
To date there have been no randomized clinical trials of therapies conducted in adenosquamous carcinomas (AdSqC's), and there are no published guidelines in place for their treatment.
