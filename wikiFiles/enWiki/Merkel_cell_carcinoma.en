[[Merkel cell]] [[carcinoma]] is a rare and highly aggressive skin [[cancer]], which, in most cases, is caused by a virus ([[Merkel cell polyomavirus]]) discovered by scientists at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 2008.<ref name=Feng_2008>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1152586 |title=Clonal Integration of a Polyomavirus in Human Merkel Cell Carcinoma |year=2008 |last1=Feng |first1=H. |last2=Shuda |first2=M. |last3=Chang |first3=Y. |last4=Moore |first4=P.

Approximately 80% of Merkel cell carcinomas are caused by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV).   The virus is [[clonal]]ly integrated into the cancer cells.   In addition, the virus has a particular mutation only when found in cancer cells, but not when it is detected in healthy skin cells.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/105/42/16272.full Shuda M, Feng H, Kwun HJ, Rosen ST, Gjoerup O, Moore PS, et al.

Because of the viral origin for this cancer, immunotherapies are a promising avenue for research to treat virus-positive Merkel cell carcinoma.   

This cancer is considered to be a form of [[neuroendocrine tumor]]. While patients with a small tumor (less than 2&nbsp;cm) that has not yet metastasized to regional [[lymph node]]s have an expected 5-year survival rate of more than 80 percent, once a [[lesion]] has [[metastasis|metastasized]] regionally, the rate drops to about 50 percent. Up to half of patients that have been seemingly treated successfully (i.e. that initially appear cancer-free) subsequently suffer a recurrence of their [[disease]].<ref name="pmid15800320">{{cite journal |author=Allen PJ, Bowne WB, Jaques DP, Brennan MF, Busam K, Coit DG |title=Merkel cell carcinoma: prognosis and treatment of patients from a single institution |journal=J.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) occurs most often on the sun-exposed face, head, and neck.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Merkel cell carcinoma arm.jpg|thumb|Small spot on the left arm is Merkel cell cancer.]]
MCC usually presents as a firm, painless, [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]] (up to 2&nbsp;cm diameter) or mass (>2&nbsp;cm diameter). These flesh-colored, red, or blue [[tumor]]s typically vary in size from 0.5&nbsp;cm (less than one-quarter of an inch) to more than 5&nbsp;cm (2 inches) in diameter, and usually enlarge rapidly. Although MCC's may arise almost anywhere on the body, about half originate on sun-exposed areas of the head and neck, one-third on the legs, and about one-sixth on the arms. In about 12% of cases, no obvious anatomical site of origin ("primary site") can be identified.<ref name='DeneveMessina'>Deneve JL, Messina JL, Marzban SS ''et al''. Merkel Cell Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Origin. ''Ann Surg Oncol'' 2012 Jan 21.</ref>

Merkel cell cancers tend to invade locally, infiltrating the underlying [[subcutaneous]] [[Adipose tissue|fat]], [[fascia]], and [[muscle]], and typically [[metastasize]] early in their natural history, most often to the regional [[lymph nodes]]. MCC's also spread aggressively through the [[blood]] vessels, particularly to [[liver]], [[lung]], [[brain]], and [[bone]].

==Cause==

S. |journal=Science |volume=319 |pages=1096–100 |pmid=18202256 |issue=5866 |pmc=2740911}}</ref>[http://www.tumorvirology.pitt.edu/mcvrsch.html].  Approximately 80% of MCC have this virus integrated in a [[monoclonal]] pattern [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1152586][http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/health/research/17cnd-virus.html?ref=health], indicating that the infection was present in a precursor cell before it became cancerous.   At least 20% of MCC tumors are not infected with MCV, suggesting that MCC may have other causes as well.

[[Polyomavirus]]es have been known to be oncogenic (cancer-causing) viruses in animals since the 1950s [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864777-3,00.html], but MCV is the first polyomavirus strongly suspected to cause tumors in humans. Like other tumor viruses, most people who are infected with MCV probably do not develop MCC. It is currently unknown what other steps or co-factors are required for MCC-type cancers to develop.<ref name="Cancer">{{cite web |url=http://news.theage.com.au/new-virus-linked-to-rare-but-lethal-skin-cancer/20080119-1muc.html|title=New virus linked to rare but lethal skin cancer|publisher=The Age|accessdate=2008-02-26 |work=}}</ref> Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, which is found in natural sunlight and in the artificial light generated by tanning beds, probably contributes to MCC development in a high percentage of cases. MCC can also occur together with other sun exposure-related skin cancers that are not infected with MCV (i.e. [[basal cell carcinoma]], [[squamous cell carcinoma]], [[melanoma]]).  Intriguingly, most MCV viruses obtained so far from tumors have specific mutations that render the virus uninfectious [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/42/16272.long][http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121664799/abstract]. It is unknown whether these particular [[mutation]]s result from sun exposure.  MCC also occurs more frequently than would otherwise be expected among [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressed]] patients, such as [[organ transplant|transplant]] patients, [[AIDS]] patients, and the elderly persons, suggesting that the initiation and progression of the disease is modulated by the [[immune system]][http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/114266344/HTMLSTART][http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=18280333].

While [[infection]] with MCV is common in humans [http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1000363], MCC patients whose tumors contain MCV have higher [[antibody]] levels against the virus than similarly infected healthy adults [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122323759/abstract].  A recent study of a large patient registry from [[Finland]] suggests that individuals with MCV-positive MCC's have better [[prognosis|prognoses]] than do MCC patients without MCV infection [http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/101/13/938]. While MCV-positive MCC may be a less aggressive form of the disease, the results of the aforementioned study may instead be due to significant differences in other [[confounder|confounding factors]], including [[cancer staging|tumor stage]] at the time of [[diagnosis]], the age of the patient, or the location of the tumor rather than any intrinsic difference in disease aggressiveness or response to therapy.

==Epidemiology==
This type of cancer occurs most often in [[White people|Caucasians]] between 60 and 80 years of age, and its rate of [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] is about twice as high in males as in females. There are roughly 1,500 new cases of MCC diagnosed each year in the [[United States]],<ref name='SchramaUgurel'>Schrama D, Ugurel S, Becker JC. Merkel cell carcinoma: recent insights and new treatment options. ''Curr Opin Oncol'' 2012;24:141-9</ref> as compared to around 60,000 new cases of [[melanoma]] and over 1 million new cases of [[skin cancer|nonmelanoma skin cancer]].<ref name="pmid15611998">{{cite journal |author=Hodgson NC |title=Merkel cell carcinoma: changing incidence trends |journal=J Surg Oncol |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |year=2005 |pmid=15611998 |doi=10.1002/jso.20167}}</ref>  MCC is sometimes mistaken for other [[histology|histological]] types of cancer, including [[basal cell carcinoma]], [[squamous cell carcinoma]], [[malignant melanoma]], [[lymphoma]], and [[small cell carcinoma]], or as a benign [[cyst]]. [[Medical research|Researchers]] believe that exposure to [[sunlight]] or [[ultraviolet light]] (such as in a tanning bed) may increase the risk of developing this disease. Similarly to melanoma, the incidence of MCC in the US is increasing rapidly.<ref name='SchramaUgurel'>Schrama D, Ugurel S, Becker JC. Merkel cell carcinoma: recent insights and new treatment options. ''Curr Opin Oncol'' 2012;24:141-9.</ref>

[[Immune suppression]] can profoundly increase the odds of developing Merkel cell carcinoma.  According to a recent study in ''The Lancet'', Merkel cell carcinoma occurs 13.4 times more often in people with advanced [[HIV]] as compared to the general population.  [[organ transplant|Solid organ transplant]] recipients have similarly increased risk. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Treatment==
Because Merkel cell cancer is uncommon<ref name='SchramaUgurel'>Schrama D, Ugurel S, Becker JC. Merkel cell carcinoma: recent insights and new treatment options. ''Curr Opin Oncol'' 2012;24:141-9.</ref> and is difficult to diagnose, patients may want a second opinion about the diagnosis and treatment plan before starting [[Cancer treatment|treatment]]. However, early diagnosis and treatment of Merkel cell cancers are important factors in decreasing the chance of metastasis, after which it is exceptionally difficult to cure.

===Surgery===
[[Cancer#Surgery|Surgery]] is usually the first treatment that a patient undergoes for Merkel cell cancer. Lesions usually appear purple-red in color, and there is little else to distinguish this variant of [[skin cancer]] from other types. Its identity usually comes as a surprise after surgery and [[pathology|pathologic]] examination.

As with surgery for most other forms of cancer, it is normal for the [[surgeon]] to remove a cuff of healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. While it has been thought that leaving this margin may not be as critical as it is in the surgical [[Segmental resection|resection]] of [[melanoma]], studies also reveal that local recurrences are fairly common in MCC near the site of the surgery.

Local or regional [[Lymphatic system#Secondary lymphoid organs|lymph nodes]] are usually removed if the lesion is more than 1&nbsp;cm in diameter, due to a high risk that they will contain cancer cells ([[micrometastasis]]) that could develop into a new tumor or spread further. Sometimes, however, the doctor will first perform a "sentinel lymph node [[biopsy]]". In this procedure, the doctor injects a dye or [[radioactive]] substance near the tumor. This material flows into adjacent lymph nodes, which are identified, removed, and checked for cancer cells, indicating the sites where cancer is most likely to spread (the "sentinel" nodes). This procedure has been demonstrated to be an important prognostic indicator. Results help dictate the use of appropriate adjuvant therapies.  Usually, however, surgery alone is insufficient to cure control Merkel cell carcinoma.

===Radiation  and chemotherapy===
[[Radiotherapy]] is commonly used to treat Merkel cell cancers. The radiotherapy fields used are usually very large so as to cover sufficient areas of skin. This is necessary because of MCC's aggressive local and regional metastatic behavior.

[[Adjuvant]] [[radiotherapy]] has been shown to be effective in reducing the rates of recurrence and in increasing the survival of patients with MCC.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Patients who present with no distant metastases and a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy have a very good prognosis when treated with both surgery and radiotherapy (approximately 90% survival rate at five years).

Metastatic MCC may respond to treatment with [[chemotherapy]] and/or radiation, but current multimodal therapies are usually not curative. Intensive treatment can be effective in shrinking the tumor and improving operability when tumors are too large to be removed or located in a place where removal would be difficult or dangerous, or in [[palliative care|palliation]] of signs and symptoms caused by metastatic tumors.

===Sentinel lymph node biopsy===
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) detects MCC spread in one third of patients whose tumors would have otherwise been clinically and radiologically understaged, and who may not have received treatment to the involved node bed. There was a significant benefit of adjuvant nodal therapy, but only when the SLNB was positive. Thus, SLNB is important for both prognosis and therapy and should be performed routinely for patients with MCC. In contrast, computed tomographic scans have poor sensitivity in detecting nodal disease as well as poor specificity in detecting distant disease.<ref name="pmid16785370">{{cite journal |author=Gupta SG, Wang LC, Peñas PF, Gellenthin M, Lee SJ, Nghiem P |title=Sentinel lymph node biopsy for evaluation and treatment of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma: The Dana-Farber experience and meta-analysis of the literature |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=142 |issue=6 |pages=685–90 |year=2006 |pmid=16785370 |doi=10.1001/archderm.142.6.685 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/142/6/685}}</ref>
