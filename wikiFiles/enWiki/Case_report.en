In [[medicine]], a '''case report''' is a detailed report of the [[symptom]]s, [[medical sign|sign]]s, [[diagnosis]], treatment, and follow-up of an individual [[patient]]. Case reports may contain a [[demographic profile]] of the patient, but usually describe an unusual or novel occurrence.

== Types of case reports ==
Most case reports are on one of six topics:<ref>{{cite book |author=Debra Volkland; Robert L. Iles |title=Guidebook to better medical writing |publisher=Island Press |location=Washington, DC |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-9661831-0-X |oclc=41579709 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

* An unexpected association between [[disease]]s or [[symptom]]s.
* An unexpected event in the course of observing or treating a patient.
* Findings that shed new light on the possible [[pathogenesis]] of a disease or an adverse effect.
* Unique or rare features of a disease.
* Unique therapeutic approaches.
* A positional or quantitative variation of the anatomical structures.

== Usefulness and validity ==
A case report is a type of [[anecdotal evidence]]. As such, it is less scientifically rigorous than controlled clinical data involving a larger [[sample size]]. Proponents argue that case reports have value within [[scientific method]]:

:They permit discovery of new diseases and unexpected effects (adverse or beneficial) as well as the study of mechanisms, and they play an important role in medical education. Case reports and series have a high sensitivity for detecting novelty and therefore remain one of the cornerstones of medical progress; they provide many new ideas in medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vandenbroucke JP |title=In defense of case reports and case series |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=330–4 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11182844 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
Whereas randomized clinical trials usually only inspect one variable or very few variables, rarely reflecting the full picture of a complicated medical situation, the case report can detail many different aspects of the patient’s [[medicine|medical]] situation (e.g. [[patient history]], [[physical examination]], [[diagnosis]], [[psychosocial]] aspects, follow up).<ref name="Yitschaky, 2011">{{cite journal |author=Yitschaky O, Yitschaky M, Zadik Y |title=Case report on trial: Do you, Doctor, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=179 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21569508 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/pdf/1752-1947-5-179.pdf| format=PDF|doi=10.1186/1752-1947-5-179 |pmc=3113995}}</ref>

== Advantages ==
Other advantages of case reports are being published quickly in comparison to [[randomized control trial]]s, making them to be a kind of rapid short communication between clinicians, and being authored by busy clinicians who probably do not have the time or money to conduct large scale research.<ref name="Yitschaky, 2011"/>

== Publishing case reports ==
Many international journals will publish case reports, but they restrict the number that appear in the print run because this has an adverse effect on the journal  [[Impact factor|Impact Factor]]. Case reports are often put in the internet part of the journal and there is often still a requirement for a subscription to access them. However there are a few that are devoted to publishing case reports alone, and these are all [[Open access|Open Access]]. The first of these to start publishing, in 2001, is Grand Rounds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grandrounds-e-med.com/ |title=Online open peer-reviewed case report journal  |format= |work=Grand Rounds |accessdate=}}</ref> Other similar journals include Case Reports in Medicine,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/crim/ |title=Case Reports in Medicine |format= |work=hindawi |accessdate=}}</ref> [[Journal of Medical Case Reports]], and [[Cases Journal]]; all of them publish peer reviewed case reports in all areas of medicine. Cases Journal recently merged with the Journal of Medical Case Reports but still maintains an independent internet portal. [[BMJ]] Case Reports is an online, peer-reviewed journal publishing cases in all disciplines. Radiology Case Reports<ref>{{cite web |url=http://radiology.casereports.net |title=Radiology Case Reports |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> and the Journal of Radiology Case Reports<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radiologycases.com |title=Case Reports |format= |work=Journal of Radiology Case Reports  |accessdate=}}</ref> are open-access peer-reviewed journals focusing on medical imaging. Journal Of Surgical Case Reports<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jscr.co.uk |title=JSCR |format= |work=Journal of Surgical Case Reports |accessdate=}}</ref> is an open access peer reviewed journal that considers case reports in the field of surgery. Journal of Orthopaedic Case Reports<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jocr.co.in/wp/ |title=Journal of Orthopaedic Case Reports |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> is a new open access, peer reviewed journal that publishes Orthopaedic case reports.

There are a number of websites that allow patients to submit and share their own case reports with other people. Patients Like You<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patientslikeme.com |title=Treatment and Side Effect Information |format= |work=Patients Like You |accessdate=}}</ref> and Treatment Report <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treatmentreport.com |title=Share and Find Treatment Reviews for Medical Conditions |format= |work=Treatment Report |accessdate=}}</ref> are two such sites.

== Use of term outside science ==
The term is also used to describe non-scientific reports usually prepared for their educational value.

== Famous scientific case reports ==
* [[Sigmund Freud]] reported on numerous cases, including [[Anna O.]], [[Dora (case study)|Dora]], [[Oedipus complex#Little Hans: a case study by Freud|Little Hans]], [[Rat Man]], and [[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]]
* [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]] reported on "[[Joseph Merrick|The Elephant Man]]"
* [[Paul Broca]] reported on language impairment following left hemisphere lesions in the 1860s.
* [[Joseph Jules Dejerine]] reported on a case of [[pure alexia]].
* [[William MacIntyre]] reported on a case of [[multiple myeloma]] (described in the 1840s).
* [[Christiaan Barnard]] described the world's first [[heart transplant]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grandrounds-e-med.com/articles/grHist-001.htm |title=Cardiac transplantation: since the first case report |work=Grand Rounds |accessdate=}}</ref> as a case report
