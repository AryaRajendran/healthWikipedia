==Eurasian epidemics==
There are no unequivocal records of smallpox in Europe before the 6th century CE, but it has been suggested that it was a major component of the [[Plague of Athens]] that occurred in 430 BCE, during the [[Peloponnesian War]]s, and was described by [[Thucydides]]. A recent analysis of the description of clinical features provided by [[Galen]] during the [[Antonine Plague]] that swept through the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Italy]] in 165–180, indicate that it was probably caused by smallpox.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=293979|pmid=11616517|title= Galen and the Antonine Plague|pages=243–255|last1=Littman|first1=R.

Most of the details about the epidemics are lost, probably due to the scarcity of surviving written records from the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The first incontrovertible description of smallpox in [[Western Europe]] occurred in 581, when Bishop [[Gregory of Tours]] provided an eyewitness account describing the characteristic symptoms of smallpox.<ref name=Hopkins_2002 /> Waves of epidemics wiped out large rural populations.<ref>[http://www.livescience.com/history/080623-hs-smallpox.html Heather Whipps, "How Smallpox Changed the World'], ''LiveScience'', June 23, 2008</ref> The establishment of the disease in Europe was of special importance, for this served as the endemic reservoir from which smallpox spread to other parts of the world, as an accompaniment of successive waves of European exploration and colonization.

Around 400 AD, an Indian medical book recorded a disease marked by [[pustule]]s and boils, saying "the pustules are red, yellow, and white and they are accompanied by burning pain … the skin seems studded with grains of rice." The Indian epidemic was thought to be punishment from a god, and the survivors created a goddess, [[Shitala Devi|Sitala]], as the anthropomorphic personification of the disease.<ref name=Nicholas_1981>{{cite journal | author = Nicholas R | title = The goddess Sitala and epidemic smallpox in Bengal, India | journal = J Asian Stud | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–45 | year = 1981 | pmid = 11614704 | doi = 10.2307/2055600 | jstor = 2055600}}</ref><ref name=Sitala>{{cite web | title=Sitala and Smallpox | work=The thermal qualities of substance: Hot and Cold in South Asia |url = http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~snarayan/anthro-pap/subsection3_4_3.html | accessdate = 2006-09-23}}</ref><ref>[http://reli350.vassar.edu/kissane/sitala.html Vassar: Points out that variolation was regarded as a means of invoking the goddess whereas vaccination was opposition to her.

The clearest description of smallpox from pre-modern times was given in the 9th century by the [[Islamic medicine|Persian physician]], [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi|Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi, known in the West as "Rhazes"]], who was the first to differentiate smallpox from [[measles]] and [[chickenpox]] in his ''Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah'' (''The Book of Smallpox and Measles'').<ref>{{cite journal |author=Otri AM, Singh AD, Dua HS |title=Cover illustration.

==African epidemics==
One of the earliest records of what may have been an encounter with smallpox in Africa is associated with the elephant war in 568 AD when after fighting a siege in Mecca, Ethiopian troops contracted the disease which they carried with them back to Africa. Arab ports in Coastal towns in Africa likely contributed to the importation of smallpox into Africa, as early as the 13th century, though no records exist until the 16th century. Upon invasion of these towns by tribes in the interior of Africa, a severe epidemic affected all African inhabitants while leaving the Portuguese spared. Densely populated areas of Africa connected to the Mediterranean, Nubia and Ethiopia by caravan route likely were affected by smallpox since the 11th century, though written records do not appear until the introduction of the slave trade in the 16th century.<ref name="Fenner1"/>

The slave trade continued to spread smallpox to the entire continent, with raiders pushing farther inland along caravan routes in search of slaves. The effects of smallpox could be seen along caravan routes, and those who were not affected along the routes were still likely to become infected either waiting to board or on board ships.<ref name="Fenner1" />

Smallpox in Angola was likely introduced shortly after Portuguese settlement of the area in 1484. The 1864 epidemic killed 25,000 inhabitants, one third of the total population in that same area. In 1713, an outbreak occurred in South Africa after a ship from India docked at Cape Town, bringing infected laundry ashore. Many of the white population suffered, and whole clans of the Hottentot tribe were wiped out. A second outbreak occurred in 1755, again affecting both the white population and the Hottentots. The Hottentots spread the disease further among their tribes, and completely eradicating several tribes, all the way to the Kalahari desert. A third outbreak in 1767 similarly affected the Hottentots and Bantu tribes, but the whites settlers, having practiced [[variolation]], were not affected nearly to the extent that they were in the first two outbreaks. Continued slaving operations brought smallpox to Cape Town again in 1840, taking the lives of 2500 people, and then to Uganda in the 1840s. It is estimated that up to eighty percent of the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] tribe was exterminated by smallpox in 1831, and whole tribes were being wiped out in Kenya up until 1899. Along the Zaire river river basin were areas where no one survived the epidemics, leaving the land devoid of human life. In Ethiopia and the Sudan, Six epidemics occurred in over the 19th century as follows: 1811–1813, 1838–1839, 1865–1866, 1878–1879, 1885–1887, and 1889–1890.<ref name="who">Fenner, Frank, Donald A.

After first contacts with [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] and [[Africans]], some believe that the death of 90–95% of the native population of the [[New World]] was caused by [[Old World]] diseases.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html The Story Of...

In 1519 [[Hernán Cortés]] landed on the shores of what is now [[Mexico]] and was then the [[Aztec]] empire. In 1520 another group of Spanish arrived in Mexico from [[Hispaniola]], bringing with them the smallpox which had already been ravaging that island for two years. When Cortés heard about the other group, he went and defeated them. In this contact, one of Cortés's men contracted the disease. When Cortés returned to [[Tenochtitlan]], he brought the disease with him.

Soon, the Aztecs rose up in rebellion against Cortés and his men. Outnumbered, the Spanish were forced to flee. In the fighting, the Spanish soldier carrying smallpox died. After the battle, the Aztecs contracted the virus from the invaders' bodies.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} Cortes would not return to the capital until August 1521. In the meantime smallpox devastated the Aztec population. It killed most of the Aztec army and 25% of the overall population.<ref>Worldviews: Contact and Change (Alberta grade 8 social studies textbook), page 233.</ref> The Spanish Franciscan Motolinia left this description: "As the Indians did not know the remedy of the disease…they died in heaps, like bedbugs. In many places it happened that everyone in a house died and, as it was impossible to bury the great number of dead, they pulled down the houses over them so that their homes become their tombs."<ref>Quoted in Tzvetan Todorov, ''The Conquest of America: The Question of the Other'' (1999:136).</ref> On Cortés's return, he found the Aztec army’s [[chain of command]] in ruins. The soldiers who still lived were weak from the disease. Cortés then easily defeated the Aztecs and entered Tenochtitlán.<ref>[http://www.strategypage.com/articles/smallpox/3.asp – The War Against Smallpox]. Strategypage.com (2007-09-25).

The effects of smallpox on [[Inca empire|Tahuantinsuyu]] (or the [[Inca]] empire) were even more devastating. Beginning in [[Colombia]], smallpox spread rapidly before the Spanish invaders first arrived in the empire. The spread was probably aided by the efficient [[Inca road system]]. Within months, the disease had killed the [[Sapa Inca|Incan Emperor]] [[Huayna Capac]], his successor, and most of the other leaders. Two of his surviving sons warred for power and, after a bloody and costly war, [[Atahualpa]] become the new emperor. As Atahualpa was returning to the capital [[Cusco|Cuzco]], [[Francisco Pizarro]] arrived and through a series of deceits captured the young leader and his best general. Within a few years smallpox claimed between 60% and 90% of the Inca population,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20061103220859/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/orlow-e.html Silent Killers of the New World]. millersville.edu</ref> with other waves of European disease weakening them further. A handful of historians argue that a disease called [[Bartonellosis]] might have been responsible for some outbreaks of illness, but this opinion is in the scholarly minority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.umn.edu/~rmccaa/aha2004/cookaha2004.pdf|title=Smallpox or Bartonellosis?": Comment on "Epidemics and Demographic Disaster in Colonial Latin America: A Reassessment|year=2004|author=Cook, Noble David|format=PDF}}</ref> The effects of Bartonellosis were depicted in the ceramics of the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of ancient [[Peru]].<ref>Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum.

Even after the two largest empires of the Americas were defeated by the virus and disease, smallpox continued its march of death. In 1561, smallpox reached [[Chile]] by sea, when a ship carrying the new governor [[Francisco de Villagra]] landed at [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]]. Chile had previously been isolated by the [[Atacama Desert]] and [[Andes Mountains]] from Peru, but at the end of 1561 and in early 1562, it ravaged the Chilean native population. Chronicles and records of the time left no accurate data on mortality but more recent estimates are that the natives lost between twenty and twenty five percent of their population. The Spanish historian Marmolejo said that gold mines had to shut down when all their Indian labor died.<ref>[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01715307659037196322257/not0002.htm#N_87_ Diego Barros Arana, Historia general de Chile, Tomo Segundo], pg. 51 note 87, pg. 231–232.</ref> [[Mapuche]] fighting Spain in [[Araucanía (historic region)|Araucanía]] regarded the epidemic as a magical attempt by [[Francisco de Villagra]] to exterminate them because he could not defeat them in the [[Arauco War]].<ref name=Alonso_CAP33>Alonso de Góngora Marmolejo [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/bameric/02582741011358306311291/p0000003.htm#I_34_ Historia de Chile desde su descubrimiento hasta el año 1575].

A particularly virulent sequence of smallpox outbreaks took place in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. From 1636 to 1698, Boston endured six epidemics. In 1721, the most severe epidemic occurred. The entire population fled the city, bringing the virus to the rest of the [[Thirteen Colonies]].

By 1832, the federal government of the [[United States]] established a [[Smallpox vaccine|smallpox vaccination]] program for Native Americans.<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/wicazo_sa_review/v018/18.2pearson01.html Lewis Cass and the Politics of Disease: The Indian Vaccination Act of 1832].

In 1900 starting in New York City, Smallpox reared it's head once again and started a sociopolitical battle with lines drawn between the rich and poor, white and black.  In populations of railroad and migrant workers that traveled from city to city the disease had reached a low endemic boil.  This fact did not bother the government at he time, nor did it spur them to action.  Despite the general acceptance of the [[germ theory of disease]], pioneered by [[John Snow]] in 1849, smallpox was still thought to be mostly a malady that followed the less distinct guidelines of a filth disease and therefore affected the lower classes only.<ref>Willrich, Micheal (2011). Pox: An American History. 1st ed. London, England: The Penguin Press p. 15-30</ref> Continued in [[Smallpox in North America, Circa 1900]]

In Canada, between 1702–1703, nearly a quarter of the population of Quebec city was killed due to a smallpox epidemic.<ref name="who" />

==Australasian epidemics==
In 1789, near Sydney, smallpox devasted the [[indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] population of coastal [[New South Wales]] (NSW). The extent of this outbreak is disputed, but some sources claim that it killed about 50% of all [[indigenous Australians]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Smallpox Through History|url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701508643/Smallpox_Through_History.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257008292443871|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Controversy has long surrounded a popular theory that smallpox was introduced to NSW in 1789 by British settlers. The hypothesis was tentatively put forward in 1914 by the Director of the Australian Quarantine Service, Dr. J.H.L. Cumpston.<ref>Cumpston, JHL "The History of Small-Pox in Australia 1788–1908", Government Printer (1914) Melb.</ref> and most forcefully stated by the economic historian, Noel Butlin, in 1983.<ref>Butlin, Noel | title=Our Original Aggression | publication-date=1983 | pp 19–24, 138–39</ref> This theory was rebutted by [[Judy Campbell (historian)|Judy Campbell]]'s full length book ''Invisible Invaders'' (2002).<ref name="Campbell"/> In particular, Campbell argued that scientific evidence concerning the viability of variolous matter (used for inoculation) does not support the possibility of the disease being brought to Australia on the long voyage from Europe.  Some, however, such as Christopher Warren (2007);<ref>{{cite journal|author=Warren C.|title=Could First Fleet smallpox infect Aborigines? – A note|journal=Aboriginal History |volume=31|pages=152–164|url= http://www.scribd.com/doc/49665744/Warren-AbHist31-2007}}</ref> and Craig Mear (2008);<ref>{{cite journal | author=Mear C | title = The origin of the smallpox in Sydney in 1789 | journal = Journal of Royal Australian Historical Society | volume = 94 | issue = 1| pages = 1–22 }}</ref> continue to hold that smallpox emanated from the importation of [[Inoculation|variolous]] matter on the [[First Fleet]]. Warren argued that Campbell's approach was based on a false premise. After [[H. A. Willis]] (2010) reiterated Campbell's argument,<ref name="willis 2010">{{Citation | author1=Willis, H. A | title=Poxy history [Smallpox and Aboriginal history.] | journal=Quadrant (Sydney) | publication-date=2010-09 | volume=54 | issue=9 | pages=70–73 | issn=0033-5002 }}</ref> Warren (2011) suggested that Willis had not taken into account research on how heat affects the smallpox virus, cited by the World Health Organization.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Warren, C. | title=The 1789 Smallpox | journal=Quadrant (Sydney) | publication-date=2011 | volume=55 | issue=4 | page=4 | issn=0033-5002 }}</ref> Willis (2011) replied that his position was supported by a closer reading of Fenner’s WHO Report.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Willis, H.A. | title=Bringing Smallpox with the First Fleet | journal=Quadrant (Sydney) | publication-date=2011 | volume=55 | issue=7–8 | page=2 | issn=0033-5002 }}</ref> and invited readers to consult the report online.<ref name= Fenner1/>

Campbell’s finding that the 1789 outbreak was introduced to Australia by [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan mariners visiting Arnhem Land]] follows the opinion of [[C. C. Macknight|C.&nbsp;C. Macknight]], an authority on the interaction between indigenous Australians and the [[Makassar|Macassans]].<ref>Macknight, C.&nbsp;C. "Macassans and the Aboriginal past" in ''Archaeologia Oceania'' | publication-date=1986 | volume=21 | pages=69–75</ref> Citing the scientific opinion of [[Frank Fenner]] (who wrote the forward to her book), and historical documents, Campbell (2002) argued that the 1789 outbreak was introduced to Australia by Macassans, from where it spread overland.<ref name="Campbell">Campbell, Judy; 2002, ''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780–1880'', Carlton, Melbourne University Press, pp60–2, 80–1, 194–6, 201, 216–7</ref> More recently, Macknight (2011) has re-entered the debate by declaring: “The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [[trepang]]ers on the north coast and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.”<ref>Macknight, Campbell "The view from Marege’: Australian knowledge of Makassar and the impact of the trepang industry across two centuries " in ''Aboriginal History'' | publication-date=2011 | volume=35 | pages=121–143.</ref> 

Another major outbreak was observed in 1828–30, near [[Bathurst, New South Wales]].<ref>Cumpston, JHL "The History of Small-Pox in Australia 1788–1908", Government Printer (1914) Melb.</ref> A third epidemic occurred in the [[Northern Territory]] and North-West Australia in the mid-1860s.<ref name="willis 2010"/>  

Elsewhere in the Pacific, smallpox killed many [[New Zealand]] [[Māori people|Māori]],<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110514035556/http://web3.canr.msu.edu/overseas/nzenvironsci/infopart2.htm New Zealand Historical Perspective]. canr.msu.edu</ref>

==Eradication==
Early in history, it was observed that those who had contracted smallpox once were never struck by the disease again. Thought to have been discovered by accident, it became known that those who contracted smallpox through a break in the skin in which smallpox matter was inserted received a less severe reaction than those who contracted it naturally. This realization led to the practice of purposely infecting people with matter from smallpox scabs in order to protect them later from a more severe reaction. This practice, known today as variolation, was first practiced in China in the 10th century.<ref name="who" /> Methods of carrying out the procedure varied depending upon location. Variolation was the sole method of protection against smallpox other than quarantine until Jenner's discovery of the inoculating abilities of cowpox against the smallpox virus in 1798. Efforts to protect populations against smallpox by way of vaccination followed for centuries after Jenner's discovery. Smallpox has since been completely eradicated since 1979, because of the mass vaccination efforts of the World Health Organization.

==Variolation==
The word variolation is synonymous with inoculation, insertion, en-grafting, or transplantation. The term is used to define insertion of smallpox matter, and distinguishes this procedure from vaccination, where cowpox matter was used to obtain a much milder reaction among patients.<ref name="who" />

===Asia===
The practice of [[variolation]] (also known as [[inoculation]]) first came out of the orient.<ref name="U.S. National Library of Medicine.">U.S. National Library of Medicine. “Variolation.” Accessed October 29, 2012. www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/smallpox/sp_variolation.html</ref>  First writings documenting variolation in China appear around 1500. Scabs from smallpox victims who had the disease in its mild form would be selected, and the powder was kept close to body temperature by means of keeping it close to the chest, killing the majority of the virus and resulting in a more mild case of smallpox.<ref name="glynn" /> Scabs were generally used when a month old, but could be used quicker in hot weather (15–20 days), and slower in winter (50 days). The process was carried out by taking eight smallpox scabs and crushing them in a mortar with two grains of ''[[Uvularia grandiflora]]'' in a mortar.<ref name="who" /> The powder was administered nasally through a silver tube that was curved at its point, through the right nostril for boys and the left nostril for girls.<ref name="glynn" /> A week after the procedure, those variolated would start to produce symptoms of smallpox, and recovery was guaranteed. In India, where the European colonizers came across variolation in the 17th century, a large, sharp needle was dipped into the pus collected from mature smallpox sores. Several punctures with this needle were made either below the deltoid muscle or in the forehead, and then were covered with a paste made from boiled rice.<ref name="glynn" />  Variolation spread further from India to other countries in south west Asia, and then to the Balkans.<ref name="who" />

===Europe===

====Mary Wortley Montagu====
[[File:Lady Mary Wortley Montagu with her son Edward by Jean Baptiste Vanmour.jpg|left|thumb|Lady Mary Wortley Montagu with her son, Edward Wortley Montagu, who was variolated in March, 1718 by Dr. Charles Maitland<ref name="killer" />]]In 1713, Mary Wortley Montagu's brother died of smallpox; she too contracted the virus two years later at the age of twenty-six, leaving her badly scarred.<ref name="montagu">Case, Christine L, and Chung, King Thom. “Montagu and Jenner: The Campaign Against Smallpox."

Accessed October 29, 2012. www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/montagu-smallpox.asp</ref>  Her son underwent the procedure, which performed by [[Dr. Charles Maitland]],<ref name="montagu" /> and survived with no ill effects. When an epidemic broke out in London following her return, [[Mary Wortley Montagu]] wanted to protect her daughter from the virus by having her variolated as well. Maitland performed the procedure, which was a success.<ref name="montagu" /> The story made it to the newspapers and was a topic for discussion in London salons.<ref name="fire" /> Princess Caroline of Wales wanted her children variolated as well but first wanted more validation of the operation. She had both an orphanage and several convicts variolated before she was convinced.<ref name="U.S. National Library of Medicine." /><ref name="montagu" /> When the operation, performed by the King's surgeon, [[Claude Amyand]], and overseen by Maitland,<ref name="glynn">Glynn, Ian and Jennifer Glynn. ''The Life and Death of Smallpox.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004.</ref> was a success, variolation got the royal seal of approval and the practice became widespread.<ref name="macnalty">MacNalty, Arthur S. “The Prevention of Smallpox: From Edward Jenner to Monckton Copeman.” ''Medical History'' 12, no. 1 (1968): 1–18.</ref>
When the practice of variolation set off local [[epidemics]] and caused death in two cases, public reaction was severe. Minister [[Edmund Massey]], in 1772, called variolation dangerous and sinful, saying that people should handle the disease as the biblical figure Job did with his own tribulations, without interfering with God's test for mankind.<ref name="glynn" /><ref name="fire" />  Lady Mary still worked at promoting variolation but its practice waned until 1743.<ref name="fire" />

Robert and [[Daniel Sutton]] further revived the practice of variolation in England by advertising their perfect variolation record, maintained by selecting patients who were healthy when variolated and were cared for during the procedure in the Sutton's own hygienic hospital.<ref name="fire" /> Other changes that the Suttons made to carrying out the variolation process include reducing and later abolishing the preparatory period before variolation was carried out, making more shallow incisions to distribute the smallpox matter, using smallpox matter collected on the fourth day of the disease, where the pus taken was still clear, and recommending that those inoculated get fresh air during recovery.<ref name="glynn" /> The introduction of the shallower incision reduced both complications associated with the procedure and the severity of the reaction.<ref name="killer">Hopkins, Donald R. ''The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History.'' Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2002.</ref> The prescription of fresh air caused controversy about Sutton's method and how effective it was in reality when those inoculated could walk about and spread the disease to those that had never before experienced smallpox.<ref name="glynn" /> It was the Suttons who introduced the idea of mass variolation of an area when an epidemic broke out as means of protection to the inhabitants in that location.<ref name="killer" />

News of variolation spread to the royal families of Europe. Several royal families had themselves variolated by English physicians claiming to be specialists. Recipients include the family of [[Louis XV]] following his own death of smallpox, and [[Catherine the Great]], whose husband had been horribly disfigured by the disease.<ref name="fire" /><ref name="macnalty" /> Catherine the Great was variolated by Thomas Dimsdale, who followed Sutton's method of inoculation.<ref name="glynn" />
In France, the practice was sanctioned until an epidemic was traced back to an [[inoculation]]. After this instance, variolation was banned within city limits. These conditions caused physicians to move just outside the cities and continue to practice variolation in the suburbs.<ref name="fire" />

====Edward Jenner====
[[File:Eduard Jenner.jpg|left|thumb|Edward Jenner (1749–1823)]][[Edward Jenner]] was variolated in 1756 at age eight in an inoculation barn in Wooton, England. At this time, in preparation for variolation children were bled repeatedly and were given very little to eat and only given a diet drink made to sweeten their blood. This greatly weakened the children before the actual procedure was given.<ref name="glynn" /><ref name="country doctor">Bailey, Ian. “Edward Jenner (1749–1823): Naturalist, Scientist, Country Doctor, Benefactor to Mankind.” ''Journal of Medical Biography'' 4 no.2 (1996): 63–70.</ref> Jenner's own inoculation was administered by a Mr. Holbrow, an apothecary. The procedure involved scratching the arm with the tip of a knife, placing several [[smallpox]] scabs in the cuts and then bandaging the arm. After receiving the procedure, the children stayed in the barn for several weeks to recover. First symptoms occurred after one week and usually cleared up three days later. On average, it took a month to fully recover from the encounter with smallpox combined with weakness from the preceding starvation.<ref name="fire" />
At the age of thirteen, Jenner was sent to study medicine in Sodbury with [[Daniel Ludlow]], a surgeon and apothecary, from 1762–1770<ref name="montagu" /><ref name="country doctor" /><ref name="UCLA">The UCLA Louise M. Darling Biomedical Library History and Special Collections Division. “Smallpox: an online exhibit.” Accessed October 29, 2012. Unitproj.library.ucla.edu/biomed/his/smallpox/jenner.html</ref> who had a strong sense of cleanliness which Jenner learned from him. During his apprenticeship, Jenner heard that upon contracting [[cowpox]], the recipient became immune to smallpox for the remainder of their life.<ref name="montagu" /><ref name="macnalty" /> However, this theory was dismissed because of several cases proving that the opposite was true. After learning all he could from Ludlow, Jenner apprenticed with [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] in London from 1770–1773.<ref name="montagu" /><ref name="UCLA" /> Hunter was a correspondent of Ludlow’s, and it is likely that Ludlow recommended Jenner to apprentice with Hunter. Hunter believed in deviating from the accepted treatment and trying new methods if the traditional methods failed. This was considered unconventional medicine for the time period and had a pivotal role in Jenner's development as a scientist.<ref name="fire" /><ref name="allan">Wells, Lloyd Allan. "Why Not Try the Experiment?" The Scientific Education of Edward Jenner. ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 41, no. 1 (1999): 108–110.</ref> After two years of apprenticeship, Jenner moved back to his hometown of Berkeley,<ref name="UCLA" /> where he quickly gained the respect of both his patients and other medical professionals for his work as a physician.<ref name="fire" /> It was during this time that Jenner revisited the connection between cowpox and smallpox.<ref name="montagu" /> He began investigating dairy farms in the Gloucestershire area looking for cowpox. This research was slow going as Jenner often had to wait months or even years before cases of cowpox would again return to the Gloucestershire area.<ref name="fire" /> During his study, he found that cowpox was actually several diseases that were similar in nature but were distinguishable through slight differences, and that not all versions had the capacity to make one immune from smallpox upon contraction.<ref name="montagu" /> Through his study, he incorrectly deduced that grease, smallpox and cowpox were all the same disease, simply manifesting themselves differently in different animals, eventually setting back his research and making it difficult to publish his findings. Though Jenner had seen cases of people becoming immune to smallpox after having cowpox, too many exceptions of people still contracting smallpox after having had cowpox were arising. Jenner was missing crucial information which he later discovered in 1796.<ref name="fire" /> Jenner hypothesized that in order to become immune to smallpox using cowpox, the matter from the cowpox pustules must be administered at maximum potency; else it was too weak to be effective in creating immunity to smallpox. He deduced that cowpox was most likely to transfer immunity from smallpox if administered at the eighth day of the disease.<ref name="montagu" /> On May 14, 1796, he performed an experiment in which he took pus from a sore of a cowpox infected milkmaid named [[Sarah Nelmes]] and applied it to a few small scratches on the arm of an eight-year-old boy who had never before contracted either smallpox or cowpox, named [[James Phipps]]. Phipps recovered as expected.<ref name="montagu" /> Two months later, Jenner repeated the procedure using matter from smallpox, observing no effect. Phipps became the first person to become immune to smallpox without ever actually having the disease. He was variolated about many more times over the course of his life to prove his immunity.<ref name="fire" /> When the next cowpox epidemic broke out in 1798, Jenner conducted a series of inoculations using cowpox, all of them successful<ref name="montagu" /> except on his own son Robert.<ref name="fire" /> Because his findings were revolutionary and lacked in evidence, the Royal Society (of whom Jenner was a member) refused to publish his findings.<ref name="fire" /> Jenner then rode to London and had his book published by Sampson Low’s firm<ref name="country doctor" /> in June 1798<ref name="french">Meynell, Elinor. "French Reactions to Jenner's Discovery of Smallpox Vaccination: The Primary Sources." ''Social History of Medicine'' 8 no.2 (1995): 287.</ref> The book was an instant bestseller among the elite in London salons, in the medical establishment and among the ladies and gentlemen of the enlightenment.<ref name="fire" />
Knowledge of the ability of cowpox to provide immunity from smallpox was present in England before Jenner's discovery. In 1774, a cattle dealer named [[Benjamin Jesty]] successfully inoculated his wife and three sons using cowpox. This was before Jenner discovered the immunization capabilities of cowpox.<ref name="macnalty" /> However, Jesty simply performed the procedure; he did not take the discovery any further by inoculating his family with smallpox matter to see if there would be a reaction or perform any other trials.<ref name="glynn" /> Jenner was the first to prove the effectiveness of vaccination with cowpox using experimentation.<ref name="fire" />

===United States of America===
[[Benjamin Franklin]], who had lost his own son to smallpox in 1736, made the suggestion to create a pamphlet to distribute to families explaining how to inoculate their children themselves, so as to eliminate cost as the factor in the decision to choose to inoculate children. [[William Heberden]], a friend of Franklin's and an English physician, followed through with Franklin's idea, printing 2000 pamphlets in 1759 which were distributed by Franklin in America.<ref name="glynn" />
An American physician, [[John Kirkpatrick (physician)|John Kirkpatrick]], upon his visit to London in 1743, told of an instance where variolation stopped an epidemic in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1738,<ref name="kirkpatrick">McCandless, Peter. ''Slavery, Disease, and Suffering in the Southern Lowcountry.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011</ref> where 800 people were inoculated and only eight deaths occurred.<ref name="glynn" /> His account of the success of variolation in Charleston helped to play a role in the revival of its practice in London. Kirkpatrick also advocated inoculating patients with matter from the sores of another inoculated person, instead of using matter from the sore of a smallpox victim, a procedure that Maitland had been using since 1722.<ref name="killer" />
