'''Intraoperative blood salvage''', also known as '''autologous blood transfusion''' or '''cell salvage''', is a [[medicine|medical]] procedure involving recovering blood lost during [[surgery]] and re-infusing it into the patient. It is a major form of [[autotransfusion]].

It has been used for many years and gained greater attention over time as risks associated with allogenic (separate-donor) [[blood transfusion]] have seen greater [[publicity]] and more fully appreciated. Several [[medical devices]] have been developed to assist in salvaging the patient's own blood in the perioperative setting. These are used frequently in cardiothoracic and vascular [[surgery]], in which blood usage has traditionally been high. With a greater effort to avoid adverse events due to [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] there has also been an emphasis on blood conservation (see [[bloodless surgery]]).

==Background==
Providing safe blood for transfusion remains a challenge despite advances in preventing transmission of [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[AIDS/HIV]], [[West Nile virus]] (WNV), and transfusion-transmitted [[bacterial infection]]. Human errors such as misidentifying [[patients]] and drawing blood samples from the wrong person present much more of a risk than transmissible diseases. 

Additional risks include [[transfusion related acute lung injury]] (TRALI), a potentially life-threatening condition with symptoms such as [[dyspnea]], [[fever]], and [[hypotension]] occurring within hours of transfusion, and also transfusion-associated immunomodulation, which may suppress the [[immune response]] and cause adverse effects such a small increase in the risk of postoperative infection. 

Other risks such as variant [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (vCJD), an invariably fatal disease, remain worrisome. Blood centers worldwide have instituted criteria to reject donors who may have been exposed to vCJD. Screening for transmissible diseases and deferral policies for vCJD designed to improve safety have contributed to shrinking the donor pool. Blood shortages exist in the [[United States]] and worldwide. In many industrialized countries 5% or less of the eligible population are blood donors. 

As a result, the global medical community has increasingly moved from allogenic blood (blood collected from another person) towards [[autologous]] infusion, in which patients receive their own blood. Another impetus for autologous transfusion is the position of [[Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions|Jehovah's Witnesses on blood transfusions]]. For religious reasons, Jehovah's Witnesses will not accept any allogeneic transfusions from a volunteer's [[blood donation]], but may accept the use of autologous blood salvaged during surgery to restore their blood volume and homeostasis during the course of an operation, although not autologous blood donated beforehand.

==Bloodless options==
Ways to avoid the adverse events associated with [[allogenic]] transfusion are often grouped under the umbrella phrase [[bloodless surgery]]. There are several so-called bloodless options. These include:
* [[Minimally invasive]] surgical techniques
* [[Erythropoietin]] (a hormone that stimulates peripheral [[stem cells]] in the bone marrow to produce red blood cells)
* [[Blood substitutes]] such as blood volume expanders and oxygen carriers (the latter as yet unlicensed in [[North America]])
* [[Autotransplantation#Autologous blood donation|Autologous blood donation]], including pre-operative donation (suitable only for scheduled surgery in which transfusion is anticipated) and intraoperative autologous donation and blood salvage.

Intraoperative blood salvage has been used for many years, especially in cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, where blood usage has traditionally been high.

==Blood salvage procedures==
Several processes have been developed to assist in salvaging the patient's own whole blood in the perioperative setting. These can be categorized into three general types of salvage procedures: 

#Cell processors and salvage devices that wash and save red blood cells, i.e. "cell washers" or RBC-savers
#Direct transfusion
#Ultrafiltration of whole blood

Regardless of manufacturer, there are many types of cell processors. Cell processors are red cell washing devices that collect anticoagulated shed or recovered blood, wash and separate the [[red blood cells]] (RBC) by centrifugation, and reinfuse the RBC. RBC washing devices can help remove byproducts in salvaged blood such as activated [[cytokine]]s, [[anaphylatoxin]]s, and other waste substances that may have been collected in the reservoir suctioned from the surgical field. However, they also remove viable [[platelets]], [[clotting factors]], and other [plasma proteins] essential to whole blood and [[homeostasis]]. The various RBC-savers also yield RBC concentrates with different characteristics and quality.

Direct transfusion is a blood salvaging method associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuits or other extracorporeal circuits (ECC) that are used in surgery such as coronary artery bypass grafts ([[CABG]]), valve replacement, or surgical repair of the great vessels. Following bypass surgery the ECC circuit contains a significant volume of diluted whole blood that can be harvested in transfer bags and re-infused into patients. Residual CPB blood is fairly dilute ([Hb] = 6–9 g/dL; 60–90 g/L) compared to normal values (12–18 g/dL; 120–180 g/L) and can also contain potentially harmful contaminants such as activated cytokines, anaphylatoxins, and other waste substances that have been linked to organ [[edema]] and organ dysfunction and need a [[diuretic]] to reverse. 

Hemofiltration or ultrafiltration devices constitute the third major type of blood salvage appearing in operating rooms.  In general, ultrafiltration devices filter the patient's anticoagulated whole blood. The filter process removes unwanted excess non-cellular plasma water, low molecular weight solutes, platelet inhibitors and some particulate matter through hemoconcentration, including activated cytokines, anaphylatoxins, and other waste substances making concentrated whole blood available for reinfusion. 
Hemofilter devices return the patient's whole blood with all the blood elements and fractions including platelets, clotting factors, and plasma proteins with a substantial Hb level. Presently, the only whole blood ultrafiltration device in clinical use{{cn|date=October 2012}} is the Hemobag.<ref>[http://www.mybloodfirst.com Hemobag]</ref> These devices do not totally remove potentially harmful contaminants that can be washed away by most RBC-savers. However, the contaminants that are potentially reduced by using RBC-savers, as shown by data from [[in vitro]] laboratory tests, are transient and reversible [[in vivo]] with hemostatic profiles returning to baselines within hours. The key is that [[coagulation]] and homeostasis are immediately improved with the return of concentrated autologous whole blood.

Over the years numerous studies have been done to compare these methods of blood salvage in terms of safety, patient outcomes, and cost effectiveness, often with equivocal or contradictory results.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0003-4975(91)90116-8 | author = Boldt J, Zickmann B, Fedderson B, Herold C, Dapper F, Hempelmann G. | title = Six different hemofiltration devices for blood conservation in cardiac surgery | journal = Ann Thorac Surg | month = May | year = 1991 | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 747–53 | pmid = 2025077 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0003-4975(93)90360-T | author = Sutton RG, Kratz JM, Spinale FG, Crawford FA Jr. | title = Comparison of three blood-processing techniques during and after cardiopulmonary bypass | journal = Ann Thorac Surg | month = October | year = 1993 | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages = 938–43 | pmid = 8215672 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Eichert I, Isgro F, Kiessling AH, Saggau W. | title = Cell saver, ultrafiltration and direct transfusion: comparative study of three blood processing techniques | journal = Thorac Cardiovasc Surg | month = June | year = 2001 | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 149–52 | pmid = 11432472 | doi = 10.1055/s-2001-14291 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Freischlag | first = Julie Ann | title = Intraoperative blood salvage in vascular surgery - worth the effort? | journal = Crit Care | year = 2004 | volume = 8 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = S53–S56 | url = http://ccforum.com/content/8/S2/S53 |doi=10.1186/cc2409 | pmid = 15196326}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Beckmann SR, Carlile D, Bissinger RC, Burrell M, Winkler T, Shely WW. | title = Improved coagulation and blood conservation in the golden hours after cardiopulmonary bypass | journal = J Extra Corpor Technol | month = June | year = 2007 | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–8 | pmid = 17672193 }}</ref>
