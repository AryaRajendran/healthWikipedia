'''Fragile X syndrome''' ('''FXS'''), '''Martin–Bell syndrome''', or '''Escalante's syndrome''' (more commonly used in [[South America]]n countries), is a [[Genetic disorder|genetic]] [[syndrome]] that is the most widespread single-gene cause of [[autism]] and inherited cause of [[mental retardation]] among boys. It results in a spectrum of intellectual disabilities ranging from mild to severe as well as physical characteristics such as an elongated face, large or protruding ears, and large testes ([[macroorchidism]]), and behavioral characteristics such as [[Stereotypy|stereotypic movements]] (e.g. hand-flapping), and social anxiety.

Fragile X syndrome is associated with the expansion of the CGG [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder|trinucleotide repeat]] affecting the [[FMR1|''Fragile X mental retardation 1'']] (''FMR1'') gene on the [[X chromosome]], resulting in a failure to express the [[FMRP|fragile X mental retardation protein]] (FMRP), which is required for normal neural development. Depending on the length of the CGG repeat, an [[allele]] may be classified as normal (unaffected by the syndrome), a premutation (at risk of fragile X associated disorders), or full mutation (usually affected by the syndrome).<ref>{{cite book |last=Sherman |first=S. |year=2002 |chapter=Epidemiology |title=Fragile X Syndrome, Diagnosis Treatment and Research |editor1-last=Hagerman |editor1-first=R. J. |editor2-last=Hagerman |editor2-first=P. J. |edition=3rd |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-8018-6843-2 }}</ref> A definitive diagnosis of fragile X syndrome is made through genetic testing to determine the number of CGG repeats. Testing for premutation carriers can also be carried out to allow for genetic counseling. The first complete DNA sequence of the repeat expansion in someone with the full mutation was generated by scientists in 2012 using [[SMRT sequencing]].<ref>http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2012/10/11/gr.141705.112.abstract</ref>

There is currently no drug treatment that has shown benefit specifically for fragile X syndrome. However, medications are commonly used to treat symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity, anxiety, and aggression. Supportive management is important in optimizing functioning in individuals with fragile X syndrome, and may involve speech therapy, occupational therapy, and individualized educational and behavioral programs.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Fragile x syndrom.png|thumb|Prominent characteristics of the syndrome include an elongated face, large or protruding ears, and [[low muscle tone]].]]
Aside from intellectual disability, prominent characteristics of the syndrome include an elongated face, large or protruding ears, flat feet, larger testes ([[macroorchidism]]), and [[low muscle tone]].<ref name=McLennan/><ref name=Garber/> Recurrent [[otitis media]] (middle ear infection) and [[sinusitis]] is common during early childhood. Speech may be [[cluttered speech|cluttered]] or nervous. Behavioral characteristics may include [[Stereotypy|stereotypic movements]] (e.g., hand-flapping) and atypical social development, particularly shyness, limited eye contact, memory problems, and difficulty with face encoding. Some individuals with fragile X syndrome also meet the diagnostic criteria for [[autism]].

Males with a full mutation display virtually complete [[penetrance]] and will therefore almost always display symptoms of FXS, while females with a full mutation generally display a penetrance of about 50% as a result of having a second, normal X chromosome.<ref name=Santoro/> Females with FXS may have symptoms ranging from mild to severe, although they are generally less affected than males.

===Intellectual development===
Individuals with FXS may present anywhere on a continuum from [[learning disabilities]] in the context of a normal [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) to severe [[Mental retardation|intellectual disability]], with an average IQ of 40 in males who have complete silencing of the ''FMR1'' gene.<ref name=Garber>{{cite journal|last=Garber|first=KB|coauthors=Visootsak J, Warren ST.|title=Fragile X syndrome.|journal=Eur J Hum Genet.|year=2008|volume=16|issue=6|pages=666–72|pmid=18398441|url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v16/n6/full/ejhg200861a.html|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2008.61}}</ref> Females, who tend to be less affected, generally have an IQ which is normal or borderline with learning difficulties. The main difficulties in individuals with FXS are with working and short-term memory, [[executive function]], visual memory, visual-spatial relationships and maths, with verbal abilities being relatively spared.<ref name=Garber/><ref name=Hall/>

Data on intellectual development in FXS are limited. However, there is some evidence that standardized IQ decreases over time in the majority of cases, apparently as a result of slowed intellectual development. A longitudinal study looking at pairs of siblings where one child was affected and the other was not found that affected children had an intellectual learning rate which was 55% slower than unaffected children.<ref name=Hall>{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Scott S. |first2=David D. |last2=Burns |first3=Amy A. |last3=Lightbody |title=Longitudinal Changes in Intellectual Development in Children with Fragile X Syndrome |journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology |volume=36 |issue=6 |year=2008 |pages=927–939 |doi=10.1007/s10802-008-9223-y |last4=Reiss |first4=Allan L. |pmid=18347972 }}</ref>

When both [[autism]] and FXS are present, a greater language deficit and lower IQ is observed as compared to children with only FXS.<ref name=book>Hagerman, Randi J., and Paul J. Hagerman. ''Fragile X syndrome: diagnosis, treatment, and research''. 3, illustrated ed. Baltimore, MD: JHU P, 2002.</ref>

===Social interaction===
FXS is characterized by [[social anxiety]], including poor eye contact, gaze aversion, prolonged time to commence social interaction, and challenges forming peer relationships.<ref name=Tranfaglia/> Social anxiety is one of the most common features associated with FXS, with up to 75% of males in one series characterized as having excessive shyness and 50% having panic attacks.<ref name=Bud/> Social anxiety in individuals with FXS is related to challenges with face encoding, the ability to recognize a face that one has seen before.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Holsen |first=Laura M. |first2=Kim M. |last2=Dalton |first3=Tom |last3=Johnstone |first4=Richard J. |last4=Davidson |title=Prefrontal social cognition network dysfunction underlying face encoding and social anxiety in fragile X syndrome |journal=NeuroImage |volume=43 |issue= 3|year=2008 |pages=592–604 |pmid=18778781 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.08.009 |pmc=2598775 }}</ref>

It appears that individuals with FXS are interested in social interaction and display greater empathy than groups with other causes of intellectual disability, but display anxiety and withdrawal when placed in unfamiliar situations with unfamiliar people.<ref name=Tranfaglia/><ref name=Bud/> This may range from mild social withdrawal, which is predominantly associated with shyness, to severe social withdrawal, which may be associated with co-existing autism spectrum disorder.<ref name=Bud/>

Females with FXS frequently display shyness, social anxiety and social avoidance or withdrawal.<ref name=Garber/> In addition, premutation in females has been found to be associated with social anxiety. The size of DNA insertion is related to severity of attention problems and withdrawal symptoms.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Individuals with FXS show decreased activation in the prefrontal regions of the brain. These regions are associated with [[social cognition]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== Psychiatric ===
[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) is found in the majority of males with FXS and 30% of females, making it the most common psychiatric diagnosis in those with FXS.<ref name=McLennan/><ref name=Tranfaglia>{{cite journal|last=Tranfaglia|first=M|title=The psychiatric presentation of fragile x: evolution of the diagnosis and treatment of the psychiatric comorbidities of fragile X syndrome|journal=Dev Neurosci|year=2011|volume=35|issue=5|pages=337–48|pmid=21893938|url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?DOI=000329421&typ=pdf|doi=10.1159/000329421}}</ref> Hyperactivity and disruptive behavior peak in the preschool years and then gradually decline with age, although inattentive symptoms are generally lifelong.<ref name=Tranfaglia/>

Aside from the characteristic social phobia features, a range of other anxiety symptoms are very commonly associated with FXS, with symptoms typically spanning a number of psychiatric diagnoses but not fulfilling any of the criteria in full.<ref name=Tranfaglia/> Behaviors such as hand flapping and biting, as well as aggression, can be an expression of anxiety. Although only a minority will meet the criteria for [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), a significant majority will feature obsessive-type symptoms. However, as individuals with FXS generally find these behaviors pleasurable, unlike individuals with OCD, they are more frequently referred to as stereotypic behaviors.

Mood symptoms in individuals with FXS rarely meet diagnostic criteria for a major mood disorder as they are typically not of sustained duration.<ref name=Tranfaglia/> Instead, these are usually transient and related to stressors, and may involve labile (fluctuating) mood, irritability, self-injury and aggression.

Individuals with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) are likely to experience [[dementia]], mood, and/or anxiety disorders. Males with the ''FMR1'' premutation and clinical evidence of FXTAS were found to have increased occurrence of [[somatization]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]], interpersonal sensitivity, depression, phobic anxiety, and [[psychoticism]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bourgeois |first=James A. |first2=Jennifer B. |last2=Cogswell |first3=David |last3=Hessel |title=Cognitive, anxiety and mood disorders in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome |journal=General Hospital Psychiatry |volume=29 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=349–356 |pmid= 17591512|doi=10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2007.03.003 |first4=Lin |last5=Ono |first5=Michele Y. |last6=Tassone |first6=Flora |last7=Farzin |first7=Faraz |last8=Brunberg |first8=James A. |last9=Grigsby |first9=Jim |last4=Zhang }}</ref>

=== Hypersensitivity and repetitive behavior ===
Children with fragile X have very short attention spans, are [[hyperactivity|hyperactive]], and show hypersensitivity to visual, auditory, tactile, and [[olfactory]] stimuli. These children have difficulty in large crowds due to the loud noises and this can lead to tantrums due to [[hyperarousal]]. Children with FXS pull away from light touch and can find textures of materials to be irritating. Transitions from one location to another can be difficult for children with FXS. Behavioral therapy can be used to decrease the child’s sensitivity in some cases.<ref name=book2/>

[[Perseveration]] is a common communicative and behavioral characteristic in FXS. Children with FXS may repeat a certain ordinary activity over and over. In speech, the trend is not only in repeating the same phrase but also talking about the same subject continually. Cluttered speech and [[self-talk]] are commonly seen. Self-talk includes talking with oneself using different tones and pitches.<ref name=book2/>

=== Vision ===
Ophthalmologic problems include [[strabismus]] (lazy eye). This requires early identification to avoid [[amblyopia]]. Surgery and/or patching are usually necessary to treat strabismus if diagnosed early. Refractive errors in patients with FXS are also common.<ref name=book/>

=== Neurological ===
Individuals with FXS are at a higher risk of developing [[seizures]], with rates between 10% and 40% reported in the literature.<ref name=Seizures>{{cite journal|last=Berry-Kravis|first=E|coauthors=Raspa M, Loggin-Hester L, Bishop E, Holiday D, Bailey Jr DB.|title=Seizures in Fragile X Syndrome: Characteristics and Comorbid Diagnoses|journal=Am J Intellect Dev Disabil|year=2010|volume=115|issue=6|pages=461–72|doi=10.1352/1944-7558-115.6.461|pmid=20945999|url=http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/1944-7558-115.6.461}}</ref> In larger study populations the frequency varies between 13% and 18%,<ref name=Garber/><ref name=Seizures/> consistent with a recent survey of caregivers which found that 14% of males and 6% of females experienced seizures.<ref name=Seizures/> The seizures tend to be [[Partial seizure|partial]], are generally not frequent, and are amenable to treatment with medication.

Individuals who are carriers of premutation alleles are at risk for developing [[FXTAS|fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome]] (FXTAS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease.<ref name=Santoro/><ref name=Peprah/> It is seen in approximately half of male carriers over the age of 70, while penetrance in females is lower. Typically, onset of [[tremor]] occurs in the sixth decade of life, with subsequent progression to [[ataxia]] (loss of coordination) and gradual cognitive decline.<ref name=Peprah/>

=== Working memory ===
From their 40s onward, males with FXS begin developing progressively more severe problems in performing tasks that require the central executive of [[working memory]]. Working memory involves the temporary storage of information 'in mind', while processing the same or other information. Phonological memory (or verbal working memory) deteriorates with age in males, while visual-spatial memory is not found to be directly related to age. Males often experience an impairment in the functioning of the phonological loop. The CGG length is significantly correlated with central executive and the visual–spatial memory. However, in a premutation individual, CGG length is only significantly correlated with the central executive, not with either phonological memory or visual–spatial memory.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cornish |first=Kim |first2=Cary S. |last2=Kogan |first3=Lexin |last3=Li |first4=Jeremy |last4=Turk |title=Lifespan changes in working memory in fragile X premutation males |journal=Brain and Cognition |volume=69 |issue=3 |year=2009 |pages=551–558 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2008.11.006 |first5=Sebastien |last6=Hagerman |first6=Randi J. |pmid=19114290 |last5=Jacquemont }}</ref>

=== Fertility ===
About 20% of women who are carriers for the fragile X premutation are affected by fragile X-related primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), which is defined as [[menopause]] before the age of 40.<ref name=Santoro>{{cite journal|last=Santoro|first=MR|coauthors=Bray SM, Warren ST.|title=Molecular Mechanisms of Fragile X Syndrome: A Twenty-Year Perspective|journal=Annu.

== Causes ==
Fragile X syndrome is a [[genetic disorder]] which occurs as a result of a [[mutation]] of the [[FMR1|''fragile X mental retardation 1'']] (''FMR1'') [[gene]] on the [[X chromosome]], most commonly an increase in the number of CGG [[Trinucleotide repeat disorders|trinucleotide repeats]] in the [[Five prime untranslated region|5' untranslated region]] of ''FMR1''.<ref name=Santoro/><ref name=Peprah/> Mutation at that site is found in 1 out of about every 2000 [[male]]s and 1 out of about every 259 [[female]]s. Incidence of the disorder itself is about 1 in every 3600 males and 1 in 4000–6000 females.<ref>[http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html Who.int]</ref> Although this accounts for over 98% of cases, FXS can also occur as a result of point mutations affecting ''FMR1''.<ref name=Santoro/><ref name=Peprah/>

In unaffected individuals, the ''FMR1'' gene contains 5-44 repeats of the CGG [[codon]], most commonly 29 or 30 repeats.<ref name=Santoro/><ref name=Peprah/><ref name=guidelines>{{cite journal|last=Maddalena|first=A|coauthors=Richards C, McGinniss M, Brothman A, Desnick R, Grier R, Hirsch B, Jacky P, McDowell G, Popovich B, Watson M, Wolff D.|title=Technical Standards and Guidelines for Fragile X: The First of a Series of Disease-Specific Supplements to the Standards and Guidelines for Clinical Genetics Laboratories of the American College of Medical Genetics|journal=Genetics in Medicine|year=2001|volume=3|issue=3|pages=200–205|pmid=11388762|pmc=3110344|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3110344/?tool=pubmed|doi=10.1097/00125817-200105000-00010}}</ref> Between 45 and 54 repeats is considered a "grey zone", with a premutation [[allele]] generally considered to be between 50 and 200 repeats in length. Individuals with fragile X syndrome have a full mutation of the ''FMR1'' allele, with over 200 repeats of the CGG codon.<ref name=McLennan>{{cite journal|last=McLennan|first=Y|coauthors=Polussa J, Tassone F, Hagerman R.|title=Fragile X Syndrome|journal=Current Genomics|year=2011|volume=12|issue=3|pages=216–224|pmid=22043169|pmc=3137006|doi=  10.2174/138920211795677886|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3137006/?tool=pubmed}}</ref><ref name=guidelines/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Nolin SL |title=Expansion of the fragile X CGG repeat in females with premutation or intermediate alleles |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=454–64 |year=2003 |pmid=12529854 |pmc=379237 |doi= 10.1086/367713|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002-9297(07)60554-0 |author-separator=, |author2=Brown WT |author3=Glicksman A |last4=Houck |first4=Jr. |last5=Gargano |first5=Alice D. |last6=Sullivan |first6=Amy |last7=Biancalana |first7=Valérie |last8=Bröndum-Nielsen |first8=Karen |last9=Hjalgrim |first9=Helle}}</ref> In these individuals with a repeat expansion greater than 200, there is [[methylation]] of the CGG repeat expansion and ''FMR1'' [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]], leading to the silencing of the ''FMR1'' gene and a lack of its product, [[FMRP|fragile X mental retardation protein]] (FMRP).

This methylation of ''FMR1'' in chromosome band Xq27.3 is believed to result in constriction of the X chromosome which appears 'fragile' under the microscope at that point, a phenomenon that gave the syndrome its name.

== Transmission ==
Fragile X syndrome has traditionally been considered an [[X-linked dominant inheritance|X-linked dominant]] condition with variable expressivity and possibly reduced [[penetrance]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Eur J Hum Genet |year=2008 |title= Fragile X syndrome |author= Garber KB, Visootsak J, Warren ST |pmid=18398441 | doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2008.61 |url = http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v16/n6/pdf/ejhg200861a.pdf|volume= 16 |pages= 666–72 |issue= 6}}</ref> However, due to [[genetic anticipation]] and [[X-inactivation]] in females, the inheritance of Fragile X syndrome does not follow the usual pattern of X-linked dominant inheritance and some scholars have suggested discontinuing labeling X-linked disorders as dominant or recessive.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15316978</ref> Females with full FMR1 mutations may have a milder phenotype than males due to [[mosaicism]] resulting from X-inactivation. 

Before the ''FMR1'' gene was discovered, analysis of pedigrees showed the presence of male carriers who were asymptomatic, with their grandchildren affected by the condition at a higher rate than their siblings suggesting that [[genetic anticipation]] was occurring.<ref name=Santoro/> This tendency for future generations to be affected at a higher frequency became known as the [[Sherman paradox]] after its description in 1985.<ref name=Santoro/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=SL|coauthors=Jacobs PA, Morton NE, Froster-Iskenius U, Howard-Peebles PN, Nielsen KB, Partington MW, Sutherland GR, Turner G, Watson M.|title=Further segregation analysis of the fragile X syndrome with special reference to transmitting males|journal=Hum Genet|year=1985|volume=69|issue=4|pages=289–99|pmid=3838733|doi=10.1007/BF00291644}}</ref>

The explanation for this phenomenon is that male carriers pass on their premutation to all of their daughters, with the length of the ''FMR1'' CGG repeat typically not increasing during [[meiosis]], the cell division that is required to produce sperm.<ref name=Santoro/><ref name=Peprah/> Incidentally, males with a full mutation only pass on premutations to their daughters.<ref name=Peprah/> However, females with a full mutation are able to pass this full mutation on, so theoretically there is a 50% chance that a child will be affected.<ref name=Peprah/><ref name=guidelines/> In addition, the length of the CGG repeat frequently does increase during meiosis in female premutation carriers due to instability and so, depending on the length of their premutation, they may pass on a full mutation to their children who will then be affected.

== Pathophysiology ==
FMRP is found throughout the body, but in highest concentrations within the brain and testes.<ref name=McLennan/><ref name=Santoro/> It appears to be primarily responsible for selectively binding to around 4% of [[mRNA]] in mammalian brains and transporting it out of the cell nucleus and to the [[synapses]] of [[neurons]]. Most of these mRNA targets have been found to be located in the [[dendrites]] of neurons, and brain tissue from humans with FXS and mouse models shows abnormal [[dendritic spines]], which are required to increase contact with other neurons. The subsequent abnormalities in the formation and function of synapses and development of neural circuits result in impaired [[neuroplasticity]], an integral part of memory and learning.<ref name=McLennan/><ref name=Santoro/><ref>{{cite journal |author= Bassell GJ, Warren ST |title= Fragile X syndrome: loss of local mRNA regulation alters synaptic development and function |journal=Neuron |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=201–14 |year=2008 |pmid=18957214 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2008.10.004}}</ref>

In addition, FMRP has been implicated in several signalling pathways that are being targeted by a number of drugs undergoing clinical trials. The [[Metabotropic glutamate receptor#Group I|group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor]] (mGluR) pathway, which includes [[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1|mGluR1]] and [[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5|mGluR5]], is involved in mGluR-dependent [[long term depression]] (LTD) and [[long term potentiation]] (LTP), both of which are important mechanisms in learning.<ref name=McLennan/><ref name=Santoro/> The lack of FMRP, which represses mRNA production and thereby protein synthesis, leads to exaggerated LTD. FMRP also appears to affect [[dopamine]] pathways in the prefrontal cortex which is believed to result in the attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulse control problems associated with FXS.<ref name=McLennan/><ref name=Santoro/><ref name=Tranfaglia/> The downregulation of [[GABA]] pathways, which serve an inhibitory function and are involved in learning and memory, may be a factor in the anxiety symptoms which are commonly seen in FXS.

==Diagnosis==
[[Cytogenetic]] analysis for fragile X syndrome was first available in the late 1970s when diagnosis of the syndrome and carrier status could be determined by culturing cells in a folate deficient medium and then assessing for "[[Fragile_site|fragile sites]]" (discontinuity of staining in the region of the trinucleotide repeat) on the long arm of the X chromosome.<ref name=Hogan>{{cite journal|last=Hogan|first=A|title=Visualizing carrier status: Fragile X sybndrome and genetic diagnosis since the 1940s|journal=Endeavour|date=16|year=2012|month=Jan|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160932711000950|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2011.12.002|pmid=22257912|accessdate=30 Jan 2012}}</ref> This technique proved unreliable, however, as the fragile site was often seen in less than 40% of an individual's cells. This was not as much of a problem in males, but in female carriers, where the fragile site could generally only be seen in 10% of cells, the mutation often could not be visualised.

Since the 1990s, more [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]] molecular techniques have been used to determine carrier status.<ref name=Hogan/> The fragile X abnormality is now directly determined by analysis of the number of CGG repeats using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and methylation status using [[Southern blot]] analysis.<ref name=Garber/> By determining the number of CGG repeats on the X chromosome, this method allows for more accurate assessment of risk for premutation carriers in terms of their own risk of fragile X associated syndromes, as well as their risk of having affected children. Because this method only tests for expansion of the CGG repeat, individuals with FXS due to [[missense mutations]] or [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] involving ''FMR1'' will not be diagnosed using this test and should therefore undergo sequencing of the FMR1 gene if there is clinical suspicion of FXS.

Prenatal testing with [[chorionic villus sampling]] or [[amniocentesis]] allows diagnosis of FMR1 mutation while the fetus is in utero and appears to be reliable.<ref name=Garber/>

Early diagnosis of fragile X syndrome or carrier status is important for providing early intervention in children or fetuses with the syndrome, and allowing genetic counselling with regards to the potential for a couple's future children to be affected.

== Autism and fragile X syndrome ==
Fragile X syndrome is the leading known genetic cause of [[autism]], accounting for about 5% of cases.<ref name=McLennan/><ref name=Bud/> This finding has resulted in screening for FMR1 mutation to be considered mandatory in children diagnosed with autism.<ref name=McLennan/> Of those with fragile X syndrome, prevalence of concurrent [[autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD) has been estimated to be between 15 and 60%, with the variation due to differences in diagnostic methods and the high frequency of autistic features in individuals with fragile X syndrome not meeting the DSM criteria for an ASD.<ref name=Bud/>

Although individuals with FXS have difficulties in forming friendships, those with FXS and ASD characteristically also have difficulties with reciprocal conversation with their peers. Social withdrawal behaviors, including avoidance and indifference, appear to be the best predictors of ASD in FXS, with avoidance appearing to be correlated more with social anxiety while indifference was more strongly correlated to severe ASD.<ref name=Bud/> When both autism and FXS are present, a greater language deficit and lower IQ is observed as compared to children with only FXS.<ref name="book"/>

Genetic [[Animal model|mouse models]] of FXS have also been shown to have autistic-like behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pietropaolo S, Guilleminot A, Martin B, D'Amato FR, [[Wim Crusio|Crusio WE]] |title=Genetic-background modulation of core and variable autistic-like symptoms in Fmr1 knock-out mice |journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=e17073 |year=2011 |pmid=21364941 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0017073 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017073 |accessdate=2011-04-18 |editor1-last=Cushing |editor1-first=Bruce |pmc=3043074}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bernardet M, Crusio WE |title=Fmr1 KO mice as a possible model of autistic features |journal=[[The ScientificWorldJournal]] |volume=6 |issue= |pages=1164–76 |year=2006 |pmid=16998604 |doi=10.1100/tsw.2006.220 |url=http://www.thescientificworld.co.uk/doi/getDoi.asp?doi=10.1100/tsw.2006.220 |accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mineur YS, Huynh LX, Crusio WE |title=Social behavior deficits in the Fmr1 mutant mouse |journal=[[Behavioural Brain Research]] |volume=168 |issue=1 |pages=172–5 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16343653 |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2005.11.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166-4328(05)00471-7 |accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Spencer CM, Alekseyenko O, Hamilton SM, Thomas AM, Serysheva E, Yuva-Paylor LA, Paylor R |title=Modifying behavioral phenotypes in Fmr1KO mice: genetic background differences reveal autistic-like responses |journal=Autism Research |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=40–56 |year=2011 |month=February |pmid=21268289 |doi=10.1002/aur.168 |pmc=3059810}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Spencer CM, Graham DF, Yuva-Paylor LA, Nelson DL, Paylor R |title=Social behavior in Fmr1 knockout mice carrying a human FMR1 transgene |journal=[[Behavioral Neuroscience (journal)|Behavioral Neuroscience]] |volume=122 |issue=3 |pages=710–5 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18513141 |doi=10.1037/0735-7044.122.3.710 |url=http://content.apa.org/pubmed/bne/122/3/710 |accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref>

== Management ==
=== Pharmacological ===
Due to the fact that there are no current treatments or cures for the underlying defects of FXS, it is even more critical for medical science to innovate new and efficacious pharmacological treatments as well as targeted behavioral interventions (Berry-Kravis et al., 2002).

Current trends in treating the disorder include medications for symptom-based treatments that aim to minimize the secondary characteristics associated with the disorder. If an individual is diagnosed with FXS, genetic counseling for testing family members at risk for carrying the full mutation or premutation is a critical first-step. Due to a higher prevalence of FXS in boys, the most commonly used medications are stimulants that target hyperactivity, impulsivity, and attentional problems (Garber, Visootsak, & Warren, 2008). For co-morbid disorders with FXS, antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are utilized to treat the underlying anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and mood disorders. Following antidepressants, antipsychotics such as Risperdal and Seroquel are used to treat high rates of self-injurious, aggressive and aberrant behaviors in this population (Bailey Jr et al., 2012). Anticonvulsants are another set of pharmacological treatments used to control seizures as well as mood swings in 13%-18% of individuals suffering from FXS. Drugs targeting the mGluR5 (metabotropic glutamate receptors) that are linked with synaptic plasticity are especially beneficial for targeted symptoms of FXS (Garber, Visootsak, & Warren, 2008). Lithium is also currently being used in clinical trials with humans, showing significant improvements in behavioral functioning, adaptive behavior, and verbal memory. Alongside pharmacological treatments, environmental influences such as home environment and parental abilities as well as behavioral interventions such as speech therapy, sensory integration, etc. all factor in together to promote adaptive functioning for individuals with FXS (Hagerman et al., 2009).

Despite the presence of many medications used to treat the secondary behavioral phenotype of FXS, medical scientists and policy makers need to work closely together in order to generate not only good science through efficacious treatments but also for increasing the available knowledge bank on molecular therapies and FXS through clinical trials of more known disorders such as ADHD and autism. Due to FXS individuals falling on a spectrum of cognitive deficits, planned educational curricula can be facilitated in order to manage better cognitive functioning for these individuals. It is important to understand the implications targeted treatments can have on not only the individuals with FXS, but also the clinicians and parents in close contact with these individuals, resulting in early diagnosing and screening matched with optimal targeted interventions.

Current pharmacological treatment centers on managing problem behaviors and psychiatric symptoms associated with FXS. However, as there has been very little research done in this specific population, the evidence to support the use of these medications in individuals with FXS is poor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rueda JR, Ballesteros J, Tejada MI |title=Systematic review of pharmacological treatments in fragile X syndrome |journal=BMC Neurol |volume=9|page=53 |year=2009 |pmid=19822023 |pmc=2770029 |doi=10.1186/1471-2377-9-53 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2377/9/53 }}</ref> While there is no current cure for the syndrome, there is hope that further understanding of its underlying causes will lead to new therapies.

[[ADHD]], which affects the majority of boys and 30% of girls with FXS, is frequently treated using [[stimulants]].<ref name=McLennan/> However, the use of stimulants in the fragile X population is associated with a greater frequency of adverse events including increased anxiety, irritability and mood lability.<ref name=Tranfaglia/> Anxiety, as well as mood and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, may be treated using [[SSRIs]], although these can also aggravate hyperactivity and cause disinhibited behavior.<ref name=Garber/><ref name=Tranfaglia/> [[Atypical antipsychotics]] can be used to stabilise mood and control aggression, especially in those with comorbid ASD. However, monitoring is required for metabolic side effects including weight gain and diabetes, as well as movement disorders related to [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal side effects]] such as [[tardive dyskinesia]]. Individuals with coexisting seizure disorder may require treatment with [[anticonvulsants]].

=== Non-pharmacological ===
Management of FXS may include [[speech therapy]], [[behavioral therapy]], [[Sensory integration therapy|sensory integration occupational therapy]], [[special education]], or individualised educational plans, and, when necessary, treatment of physical abnormalities. Persons with fragile X syndrome in their family histories are advised to seek [[genetic counseling]] to assess the likelihood of having children who are affected, and how severe any impairments may be in affected descendants.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Hagerman RJ |title= Advances in the treatment of fragile X syndrome |journal=Pediatrics |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=378–90 |year=2009 |pmid=19117905 |pmc= 2888470 |doi=10.1542/peds.2008-0317 |author-separator= , |author2= Berry-Kravis E |author3= Kaufmann WE |last4= Ono |first4= M.

== Research ==
The increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease in FXS has led to the development of therapies targeting the affected pathways. Evidence from mouse models shows that mGluR5 [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] (blockers) can rescue dendritic spine abnormalities and seizures, as well as cognitive and behavioral problems, and may show promise in the treatment of FXS.<ref name=McLennan/><ref>{{cite journal |journal=Neuron |year=2007 |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=955–62 |title= Correction of fragile X syndrome in mice |author= Dölen G |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.12.001 |pmid=18093519 |pmc=2199268 |author-separator=, |author2=Osterweil E |author3=Rao BS |last4=Smith |first4=Gordon B. |last5=Auerbach |first5=Benjamin D. |last6=Chattarji |first6=Sumantra |last7=Bear |first7=Mark F.}}</ref><ref name="pmid20303363">{{cite journal |author = Dölen G, Carpenter RL, Ocain TD, Bear MF | title = Mechanism-based approaches to treating fragile X | journal = Pharmacol Ther | volume = 127 | issue = 1 | pages = 78–93| year = 2010 | pmid = 20303363 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.02.008}}</ref> Two new drugs, AFQ-056 ([[mavoglurant]]) and [[dipraglurant]], as well as the repurposed drug [[fenobam]] are currently undergoing human trials for the treatment of FXS.<ref name=McLennan/><ref name=Cole>{{cite journal | author = P.

In addition, there is evidence from mouse models that [[minocycline]], an antibiotic used for the treatment of acne, rescues abnormalities of the dendrites. An open trial in humans has shown promising results, although there is currently no evidence from [[Randomized controlled trial|controlled trials]] to support its use.<ref name=McLennan/>
