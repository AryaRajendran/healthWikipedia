'''Virtual colonoscopy''' (VC, also called '''CT Colonography''' or CT Pneumocolon) is a [[medical imaging]] procedure which uses [[x-ray]]s and [[computer]]s to produce two- and [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] images of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] (large intestine) from the lowest part, the [[rectum]], all the way to the lower end of the [[small intestine]] and display them on a screen.<ref name="Heiken">{{cite journal | last=Heiken | first=JP | coauthors=Peterson CM, Menias CO | title=Virtual colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening: current status: Wednesday 5 October 2005, 14:00–16:00 | journal=Cancer Imaging | volume=5 | issue=Spec No A | pages=S133–S139 | publisher=International Cancer Imaging Society | date=November 2005 | pmid=16361129 | doi=10.1102/1470-7330.2005.0108 | pmc=1665314 }}</ref> The procedure is used to [[diagnosis|diagnose]] colon and bowel disease, including [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]], [[diverticulosis]] and [[cancer]].

==Procedure==
[[File:Vc3.theora.ogv|left|thumb|This video shows a virtual colonoscopy of the rectosigmoid colon performed in a retrograde fashion. There is a 10-mm colonoscopically-proven polyp in the sigmoid colon seen at the top of the frame at the midpoint of the movie. The movie concludes at the tip of the rectal tube which was used to insufflate the colon.]]
While preparations for VC vary, the patient will usually be asked to take [[laxative]]s or other oral agents at home the day before the procedure to clear [[feces|stool]] from the colon. A [[suppository]] is also used to cleanse the rectum of any remaining fecal matter.  The patient may also given a solution designed to coat any residual faeces which may not have been cleared by the laxative.  This is called 'faecal tagging'. This allows the user (usually a [[Radiologist|consultant radiologist]]), viewing the 3D images to effectively subtract the left over faeces, which may otherwise give false positive results.

VC takes place in the [[radiology]] department of a [[hospital]] or medical center. The examination takes about 10 minutes and does not require [[sedatives]].

During the procedure:

* The patient is placed in a [[supine position]] on the examination table
* The patient may be given a dosage of [[Butylscopolamine]] intravenously to minimize muscle activity in the area.
* A thin tube is inserted into the rectum, so that air can be pumped through the tube in order to inflate the colon for better viewing.
* The table moves through the scanner to produce a series of two-dimensional cross-sections along the length of the colon. A [[computer program]] puts these images together to create a three-dimensional picture that can be viewed on the [[video screen]].
* The patient is asked to hold his/her breath during the scan to avoid distortion on the images.
* The scan is then repeated with the patient lying in a [[prone position]].

After the examination, the images produced by the scanner must be processed into a 3D image, +/- a fly through (a cine program which allows the user move through the bowel as if performing a normal colonoscopy). A radiologist evaluates the results to identify any abnormalities.

The patient may resume normal activity after the procedure, but if abnormalities are found and the patient needs conventional [[colonoscopy]], it may be performed the same day.<ref>[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/virtualcolonoscopy/ "Virtual Colonoscopy"] - National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse - NIH</ref>

==Advantages==

VC is more comfortable than conventional colonoscopy for some people because it does not use a colonoscope. As a result, no sedation is needed, and the patient can return to his/her usual activities or go home after the procedure without the aid of another person. The lack of sedation also lowers the risk of the procedure since some people may have adverse reactions to sedative medications used during conventional colonoscopy.  VC provides clearer, more detailed images than a conventional x-ray using a [[barium enema]], sometimes called a lower gastrointestinal (GI) series. Further, about 1 in 10 patients will not have a complete right colon (cecum) evaluation completed with conventional colonoscopy.<ref name="pmid15666105">{{cite journal |author=Menardo G |title=Sensitivity of diagnostic examinations for colorectal polyps |journal=Tech Coloproctol |volume=8 Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=s273–5 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15666105 |doi=10.1007/s10151-004-0175-0}}</ref> It also takes less time than either a conventional colonoscopy or a lower GI series.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/virtual-colonoscopy/CO00025 Virtual Colonoscopy] - [[Mayo Clinic]]. "Virtual colonoscopy is typically faster than traditional colonoscopy. A scan of your colon takes about 10 minutes. Expect the entire virtual colonoscopy procedure to take 20 to 30 minutes."</ref>

VC provides a secondary benefit of revealing diseases or abnormalities outside the colon.<ref name="pmid16040909">{{cite journal |author=Yee J |title=Extracolonic abnormalities discovered incidentally at CT colonography in a male population |journal=Radiology |volume=236 |issue=2 |pages=519–26 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16040909 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2362040166 |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16040909 |accessdate=2008-12-22 |author-separator=, |author2=Kumar NN |author3=Godara S |display-authors=3 |last4=Casamina |first4=J. A. |last5=Hom |first5=R. |last6=Galdino |first6=G. |last7=Dell |first7=P. |last8=Liu |first8=D.}}</ref>

==Disadvantages==

According to an [http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/virtualcolonoscopy/index.htm article] on niddk.nih.gov, the main disadvantage to VC is that a radiologist cannot take tissue samples ([[biopsy]]) or remove polyps during VC, so a conventional [[colonoscopy]] must be performed if abnormalities are found. Also, VC does not show as much detail as a conventional colonoscopy, so polyps smaller than between 2 and 10 millimeters in diameter may not show up on the images.<ref>[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-10/wfub-cc102406.php Findings presented at the American College of Gastroenterology] annual scientific meeting in Las Vegas, Nev. An abstract of the study was printed in the September 2006 issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology.</ref> Furthermore Virtual Colonoscopy performed with CT exposes the patient to ionizing radiation, however some research has demonstrated that ultra-low dose VC can be just as effective in demonstrating colon and bowel disease due to the great difference in x-ray absorption between air and the tissue comprising the inner wall of the colon.

Optical colonoscopy is taken as the "gold standard" for colorectal cancer screening by the vast majority of the medical and research communities. Some radiologists recommend VC as a preferred approach to colorectal screening. However, virtual colonoscopy is considered the gold standard by some professionals because it permits complete visualization of the entire colon, hence providing the opportunity to identify precancerous polyps and cancer, and then to do diagnostic biopsies or therapeutic removal of these lesions, as soon as possible.
