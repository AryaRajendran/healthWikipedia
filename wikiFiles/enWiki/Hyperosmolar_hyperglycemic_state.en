'''Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state''' (HHS) is a complication of [[diabetes mellitus]] (predominantly [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2]]) in which [[Hyperglycemia|high blood sugars]] cause severe [[dehydration]], increases in [[osmolarity]] (relative concentration of solute) and a high risk of complications, [[coma]] and death. It is diagnosed with [[blood test]]s. It is related to [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA), another complication of diabetes more often (but not exclusively) encountered in people with [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]]; they are differentiated with measurement of [[ketone bodies]], organic molecules that are the underlying driver for DKA but are usually not detectable in HHS.

The treatment of HHS consists of correction of the dehydration with [[intravenous fluid]]s, reduction of the blood sugar levels with [[insulin]], and management of any underlying conditions that might have precipitated the illness, such as an acute infection.

Older names for HHS are '''hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma''' (HONK), '''nonketotic hyperosmolar coma''', '''hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome''' (favoured by the [[American Diabetes Association]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/complications/hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic.html |title=Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Nonketotic Syndrome (HHNS) |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref>)

==Signs and symptoms==
The increasing hemoconcentration and volume depletion may result in:
* Disordered mental functioning.
* Neurologic signs including [[focal neurologic signs|focal signs]] such as sensory or motor impairments or focal seizures or motor abnormalities, including flaccidity, depressed reflexes, tremors or fasciculations.
* [[Hyperviscosity syndrome|Hyperviscosity]] and increased risk of [[thrombosis]]
* Ultimately, if untreated, will lead to death

==Diagnosis==
MRI may show cortical restricted diffusion with unusual characteristics of reversible T2 hypointensity in the subcortical white matter.  <ref>Neuroradiology. 2007 Apr;49(4):299-305. Epub 2007 Jan 3.</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Nonketotic coma is usually precipitated by an infection,<ref name="Stoner">{{cite journal |last=Stoner | first=GD | title=Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state | journal=American Family Physician |volume=71 | issue=9 | pages=1723â€“30 | date=May 2005 | url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20050501/1723.html| pmid=15887451 }}</ref> myocardial infarction, stroke or another acute illness. A relative insulin deficiency leads to a serum [[glucose]] that is usually higher than 33 mmol/l (600 mg/dl), and a resulting serum [[osmolarity]] that is greater than 320 mOsm. This leads to [[polyuria]]  (excessive urination, an [[osmotic diuresis]]), which, in turn, leads to volume depletion and hemoconcentration that causes a further increase in blood glucose level. [[Ketosis]] is absent because the presence of some [[insulin]] inhibits [[hormone-sensitive lipase]] ([[lipolysis]]).

==Management==

===Intravenous fluids===
Treatment of HHS begins with reestablishing tissue perfusion using intravenous fluids.  People with HHS can be dehydrated by 8 to 12 L.  Attempts to correct this usually take place over 24 hrs with initial rates of normal saline often in the range of 1 L/hr for the first few hours.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Judith E. |last1=Tintinalli |first2=Gabor D. |last2=Kelen |first3=J.

===Electrolyte replacement===
Severe potassium deficits often occur in HHS.  They usually range around 350 mEq in a 70 kg person.  This is generally replaced at a rate 10 mEq per hour as long as there is urinary output.<ref>{{harvnb|Tintinalli|Kelen|Stapczynski|2004|p=1320}}</ref>

===Insulin===

Insulin is given to reduce blood glucose concentration; however, as it also causes the movement of potassium into cells, serum potassium levels must be sufficiently high or dangerous [[hypokalemia]] may result. Once potassium levels have been verified to be greater than 3.3 mEq/l, then an insulin infusion of 0.1 units/kg is begun.<ref>{{harvnb|Tintinalli|Kelen|Stapczynski|2004|p=1310}}</ref>
