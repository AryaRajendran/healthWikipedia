'''Interdigital webbing''' is the presence of membranes of skin between the [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]]. Normally in [[mammal]]s, webbing is present in the [[embryo]] but resorbed later in development, but in various mammal species it occasionally persists in adulthood.<ref>Rumbaugh and Chiarelli, 1972, p. 6</ref> In humans, it can be found in those suffering from [[LEOPARD syndrome]] and from [[Aarskog-Scott syndrome]].<ref>Orrico et al, 2004, ''passim''</ref>

Webbing between the digits of the hindfoot is also present in several mammals that [[semiaquatic|spend part of their time in the water]].<ref name=V455>Voss, 1988, p. 455</ref> Webbing accommodates movement in the water.<ref name=V458>Voss, 1988, p. 458</ref>

Interdigital webbing is not to be confused with [[syndactyly]], which is a fusing of digits and occurs rarely in humans. Syndactyly specifically affecting feet occurs in birds (such as [[duck]]s), amphibians (such as [[frog]]s), and mammals (such as the [[kangaroo]]).

==Mammals with interdigital webbing==

===Rodents===
[[File:Wallace frog.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An example of interdigital webbing on an [[Rhacophorus nigropalmatus|Abah River Flying Frog]].]]

In [[Oryzomyini|oryzomyines]], a mainly South American [[rodent]] group, the [[Marsh Rice Rat]], ''[[Pseudoryzomys|Pseudoryzomys simplex]]'', and ''[[Sigmodontomys alfari]]'' all have small webs, which do not extend to the end of the [[proximal phalanx|proximal phalanges]], whereas ''[[Amphinectomys|Amphinectomys savamis]]'', ''[[Lundomys|Lundomys molitor]]'' and the members of the genera ''[[Holochilus]]'' and ''[[Nectomys]]'' have more expansive webbing, which extends beyond the proximal phalanges.<ref name=W25>Weksler, 2006, p. 25</ref> Webbing apparently developed several times in oryzomyines and may also have been lost in some groups.<ref name=W79>Weksler, 2006, p. 79</ref> Most [[Ichthyomyini|ichthyomyines]], an exclusively semiaquatic South and Central American rodent group, have small webbing, but members of the genus ''[[Rheomys]]'' have more expansive webs.<ref>Voss, 1988, p. 281</ref> Webbing is also present in the Australasian semiaquatic [[hydromyine]]s (subfamily [[Murinae]]) of the genera ''[[Baiyankamys]]'', ''[[Hydromys]]'',<ref>Tate, 1951, p. 226</ref> and ''[[Crossomys]]''; in the latter, it is most well-developed.<ref>Tate, 1951, p. 227; Voss, 1988, p. 455</ref> The [[Africa]]n semiaquatic rodents ''[[Colomys|Colomys goslingi]]'' and ''[[Nilopegamys|Nilopegamys plumbeus]]'', also members of the [[Murinae]], lack interdigital webbing.<ref>Kerbis Peterhans and Patterson, 1995, p. 342; Voss, 1988, p. 455</ref> Webbing is present in the hind feet of the [[Coypu]] (''Myocastor coypus'') of South America,<ref>Braun and Díaz, 1999, p. 4</ref> which is currently classified in its own family.

===Soricomorphs===
Among [[shrew]]s, the members of the genera ''[[Chimarrogale]]'' of southeastern Asia and ''[[Neomys]]'' of western Eurasia have interdigital webbing, as does the [[American Water Shrew]] (''Sorex palustris'') of North America, but it is more well-developed in ''[[Nectogale elegans]]'' of montane Asia. Webbing is also present in the [[Pyrenean Desman]] (''Galemys pyrenaicus'').<ref name=V455/>

===Tenrecs===
The [[tenrecidae|tenrec]] family, which occurs in Africa and mainly on [[Madagascar]], includes several semiaquatic forms, and the small [[otter-shrew]]s (''[[Micropotamogale]]'') and the aptly named [[Web-footed Tenrec]] (''Limnogale mergulus'') have developed interdigital webbing.<ref name=V455/>

===Opossums===
The [[Water Opossum]] (''Chironectes minimus'') of South America is the only [[opossum]] with interdigital webbing.<ref>Voss and Jansa, 2009, p. 86</ref>

===Carnivorans===
Several [[carnivora]]ns have interdigital webbing, including the [[Greater Grison]] (''Galictis vittata''),<ref>Yensen and Tarifa, 2003, p. 3</ref> the [[Colombian Weasel]] (''Mustela felipei''), the [[Amazon Weasel]] (''Mustela africana''), and the [[Mink]] (''Neovison vison'').<ref>Harding and Smith, 2009, p. 633</ref>

All [[otter]]s have interdigital webbing, in the fore or hind limbs or both, to aid in aquatic propulsion. In sea otters, the webbing is covered with hair, at a density of 3300 hairs per square centimeter.<ref>Perrin, 2008, pp. 565, 810</ref>

===Whales===
Pits present on the sides of fossil proximal phalanges of [[pakicetid]]s, ancestral [[whale]]s, suggest that these animals had interdigital webbing,<ref>Madar, 2007, p. 195</ref> a development hypothesized to lead to the fluke,<ref>Fish p. 318</ref> spurred by [[FGF8]], a [[Fibroblast growth factor]].<ref>Cooper and Thewissen, 2009</ref>
