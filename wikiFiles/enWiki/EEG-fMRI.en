'''EEG-fMRI''' (short for ''EEG-correlated fMRI'' or ''[[electroencephalography]]-correlated [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]'') is a multimodal [[neuroimaging]] technique whereby [[EEG]] and [[fMRI]] data are recorded [[Synchronization|synchronously]] for the study of electrical [[brain]] activity in correlation with [[Hemodynamics|haemodynamic]] changes in brain during the electrical activity, be it normal function or associated with disorders.

==Principle==
Scalp [[EEG]] reflects the brain’s electrical activity, and in particular post-[[Synapse|synaptic]] potentials (see [[Inhibitory postsynaptic current]] and [[Excitatory postsynaptic potential]]) in the [[cerebral cortex]], whereas fMRI is capable of detecting [[haemodynamic]] changes throughout the brain through the [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent|BOLD]] effect. EEG-fMRI therefore allows measuring both neuronal and haemodynamic activity which comprise two important components of the [[Haemodynamic_response|neurovascular coupling]] mechanism.

==Methodology==
The simultaneous acquisition of [[EEG]] and [[fMRI]] data of sufficient quality requires solutions to problems linked to potential health risks (due to currents induced by the [[MRI|MR]] image forming process in the circuits created by the subject and EEG recording system) and EEG and fMRI data quality. There are two degrees of integration of the data acquisition, reflecting technical limitations associated with the interference between the EEG and MR instruments. These are: interleaved acquisitions, in which each acquisition modality is interrupted in turn (periodically) to allow data of adequate quality to be recorded by the other modality; continuous acquisitions, in which both modalities are able to record data of adequate quality continuously. The latter can be achieved using real-time or post-processing EEG artifact reduction software. EEG was first recorded in an MR environment around 1993.
Several groups have found independent means to solve the problems of mutual contamination of the EEG and fMRI signals. The first continuous EEG-fMRI experiment was performed in 1999

A predominantly
software-based method was implemented shortly thereafter

An addition to EEG-fMRI set up is the simultaneous and synchronized video recording without affecting the EEG and fMRI data quality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chaudhary UJ, Kokkinos V, Carmichael DW, Rodionov R, Gasston D, Duncan JS,  Lemieux L. |title=Implementation and Evaluation of Simultaneous Video-Electroencephalography (Video-EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) |journal=Magnetic Resonance Imaging |year=2010 |month=March |pmid= 20233646 |doi=10.1016/j.mri.2010.01.001 |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=1192–1199}}</ref>

For the most part, the combined EEG-fMRI data collection is now treated as a solved problem, and commercial devices are available from major manufacturers (e.g., Electrical Geodesics, Inc.; NeuroScan/Compumedics, Inc.; Brain Products; Advanced Neuro Technology), but issues remain. There are significant residual artifacts in the EEG that occur with each [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]. The traces in the EEG that record this are often referred to as a, "[[Ballistocardiography|Ballistocardiogram]] (BCG)," because of their presumed origin in the motion of the EEG leads in the magnetic field that occurs with each heartbeat. In practice, the causes of this artifact are not well proven and may be the results of factors such as induced electrical fields with the movement of blood, etc...

==Applications==
In principle, the technique combines the [[EEG]]’s well documented ability to characterise certain [[brain]] states with high temporal resolution and to reveal pathological patterns, with [[fMRI]]’s (more recently discovered and less well understood) ability to image blood dynamics through the entire brain with high spatial resolution. Up to now, EEG-fMRI has been mainly seen as an fMRI technique in which the synchronously acquired [[EEG]] is used to characterise brain activity (‘brain state’) across time allowing to map (through [[statistical parametric mapping]], for example) the associated haemodynamic changes. 

The initial motivation for EEG-fMRI was in the field of research into [[epilepsy]], and in particular the study of [[Electroencephalography#Abnormal activity|interictal epileptiform discharges]] (IED, or [[Inter-ictal spiking|interictal spikes]]), and their generators, and of seizures. IED are unpredictable and sub-clinical events in patients with epilepsy that can only be observed using [[EEG]] (or [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]]). Therefore recording [[EEG]] during [[fMRI]] acquisition allows the study of their haemodynamic correlates. The method can reveal haemodynamic changes linked to IED and [[seizures]], and has proven a powerful scientific tool. The simultaneous and synchronized video recording identifies clinical seizure activity along with electophysiological activity on EEG, which helps to investigate, correlated haemodynamic changes in brain during seizures.      

The clinical value of these findings is the subject of ongoing investigations, but recent researches suggest an acceptable [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] for EEG-fMRI studies and better [[sensitivity]] in higher field scanner.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gholipour T, Moeller F, Pittau F, ''et al.'' |title= Reproducibility of interictal EEG-fMRI results in patients with epilepsy |journal= Epilepsia |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=21054351 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2010.02768.x |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=433–442}}</ref> Outside the field of epilepsy, EEG-fMRI has been used to study event-related (triggered by external stimuli) brain responses and provided important new insights into baseline [[brain]] activity in during resting wakefulness and [[sleep]].
