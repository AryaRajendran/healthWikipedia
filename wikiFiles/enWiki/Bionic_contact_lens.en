'''Bionic contact lenses''' are being developed to provide a virtual display that could have a variety of uses from assisting the visually impaired to the video game industry.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=bionic-eyes-could-change-the-face-of-gaming | date= | publisher= | url =http://kotaku.com/346081/bionic-eyes-could-change-the-face-of-gaming | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-23 | language = }}</ref> The device will have the form of a conventional [[contact lens]] with added [[bionics]] technology.<ref>

Babak Parviz, a [[University of Washington]] assistant professor of electrical engineering is quoted as saying "Looking through a completed lens, you would see what the display is generating superimposed on the world outside.”<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Bionic eyes: Contact lenses with circuits, lights a possible platform for superhuman vision | date= | publisher= | url =http://uwnews.org/uweek/uweekarticle.asp?visitsource=uwkmail&articleID=39100 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-23 | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080120125715/http://uwnews.org/uweek/uweekarticle.asp?visitsource=uwkmail&articleID=39100 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-20}}</ref>

==Manufacture==
The lenses require [[organic matter|organic]] materials that are biologically safe and also use inorganic material for the electronic circuits. The [[electronic circuits]] are built from a layer of metal a few [[nanometre]]s thick.  The [[light-emitting diodes]] are one third of a millimetre across.  A grey powder is sprinkled onto the lens.  Then a technique called [[microfabrication]] or  '[[self-assembly]]' is used to shape each tiny component. [[Capillary action|Capillary forces]] pull the pieces into their final position.

==Development==
[[Harvey Ho]], a former graduate student of Parviz who worked at [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in Livermore, California presented the results in January 2008 at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' International Conference on [[Microelectromechanical systems|Micro Electro Mechanical Systems]] (or [[microbotics]]) in Tucson, Arizona.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Researchers Develop Bionic Contact Lens | date= 2008-01-18| publisher= | url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323929,00.html | work = Fox News| pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-23 | language = }}</ref> The lens is expected to have more electronics and capabilities on the areas where the eye does not see.

==Prototype and testing==
In 2011, scientists created and successfully tested a functioning prototype with a wireless antenna and a single-pixel display.<ref>{{cite news | first=A R | last=Lingley | coauthors=et al. | title=A single-pixel wireless contact lens display | date=2011-11-22 | publisher=Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering | url =http://iopscience.iop.org/0960-1317/21/12/125014 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2011-11-24 | language = }}</ref>

Previous prototypes proved that it is possible to create a biologically safe electronic lens that does not obstruct a person’s view. Engineers have tested the finished lenses on rabbits for up to 20 minutes and the animals showed no problems.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Vision of the future seen in bionic contact lens | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22731631/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-23 | language = }}</ref>
