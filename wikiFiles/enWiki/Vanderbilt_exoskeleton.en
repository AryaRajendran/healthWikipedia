The '''Vanderbilt exoskeleton''' is a prototype [[powered exoskeleton]] designed by the Center for Intelligent Mechatronics at [[Vanderbilt University]], [[Tennessee]].<ref name="Medgadget">{{cite web | url=http://www.medgadget.com/2012/10/inspired-by-segway-scooter-vanderbilt-exoskeleton-gets-paralyzed-on-their-legs.html | title=Inspired by Segway Scooter, Vanderbilt Exoskeleton Gets Paralyzed on Their Legs | publisher=[[Medgadget]].com | work=Rehab | date=30 October 2012 | accessdate=12 December 2012 | author=Gene Ostrovsky | quote=Medgadget is an independent journal of the latest medical gadgets, technologies and discoveries written, edited and published by a group of MDs and biomed engineers.}}</ref><ref name=Vanderbilt1>{{cite web|url=http://research.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/cim/research_orthosis.html|title=Powered Exoskeleton|publisher=[[Vanderbilt University]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> It is intended to assist [[paraplegic]]s, [[stroke]] victims and other paralyzed or semi-paralyzed people to walk independently.<ref name=Vanderbilt2>{{cite web|url=http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2012/10/exoskeleton/|title=Advanced exoskeleton promises more independence for people with paraplegia|publisher=Vanderbilt University|date=30 October 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> Motion and control technologies manufacturer [[Parker Hannifin]] is funding further development, and plans to release a commercial version of the exoskeleton in 2014.<ref name=Parker>{{cite web|url=http://www.parker.com/portal/site/PARKER/menuitem.31c35c58f54e63cb97b11b10237ad1ca/?vgnextoid=428cfd3fbfaaa310VgnVCM100000200c1dacRCRD&vgnextchannel=9104fbdc71fd7310VgnVCM100000200c1dacRCRD&vgnextfmt=default|title=Parker Signs Licensing Agreement with Vanderbilt for Exoskeleton Technology and Targets Commercial Launch in 2014|publisher=[[Parker Hannifin]]|date=30 October 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>

==Rationale==
In 2012, there were estimated to be over 270,000 Americans with long-term [[spinal cord]] injuries, of whom around 21 percent suffer from complete paraplegia.<ref name=UAlabama>{{cite web|url=https://www.nscisc.uab.edu/PublicDocuments/fact_figures_docs/Facts%202012%20Feb%20Final.pdf|title=Spinal Cord Injury Facts & Figures (PDF)|publisher=[[University of Alabama]]: National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center|date=February 2012|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref> The lifetime cost of care and lost productivity for each paraplegic ranges from US$1.4 million to $2.2 million.<ref name=UAlabama/> However, since the late 2000s, [[robotics]] and battery technology have become sufficiently advanced to make wearable walking assistance devices viable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencerecorder.com/news/nasas-strange-robotic-suit-could-pave-way-to-mars-make-astronauts-safe/|title=NASA’s strange robotic suit could pave way to Mars, make astronauts safe|publisher=Science Recorder|date=11 December 2012|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/exoskeleton-robots-top-5.html|title=I am Iron Man: Top 5 Exoskeleton Robots|publisher=[[Discovery News]]|year=2012|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref>

==Design==
The Vanderbilt exoskeleton weighs {{convert|27|lb|kg}} – lighter than most contemporary commercial medical exoskeletons – and can support users weighing up to {{convert|200|lb|kg}}.<ref name="Medgadget"/><ref name=Vanderbilt1/> It is strapped to the user's legs, and uses an onboard computer to detect the user's movements, which are then supported and amplified by battery-powered motors in the exoskeleton's hip and knee joints.<ref name=Vanderbilt2/> It also uses [[functional electrical stimulation]] to enervate the muscles of paralyzed patients, improving their strength and [[circulatory system|circulation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/vanderbilt-exoskeleton/24815/|title=Vanderbilt University steps into the exoskeleton market|work=Gizmag|date=31 October 2012|accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref> and can be quickly disassembled for easy removal.<ref name=CoExist>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680940/this-light-affordable-exoskeleton-could-help-the-paralyzed-walk-again#1|title=This Light, Affordable Exoskeleton Could Help The Paralyzed Walk Again|publisher=Fast CoExist|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> It can be used interchangeably with a [[wheelchair]], and can be donned without assistance, allowing disabled individuals significantly greater independence.<ref name=Vanderbilt2/> It is compact enough for a person to sit in a normal chair without needing to remove the exoskeleton.<ref name=CoExist/>

==Development==
Vanderbilt University has been testing its exoskeleton with paraplegics and medical experts at a rehabilitation center in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], since 2010.<ref name=CoExist/> In October 2012, Parker Hannifin signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Vanderbilt University for the right to develop and manufacture a commercial version of the exoskeleton, which it plans to release in 2014.<ref name=Parker/> Whereas existing commercial exoskeletons can cost as much as $140,000, Parker Hannifin hopes to leverage its manufacturing capabilities and the Vanderbilt model's lightweight design to ensure that the final version is significantly cheaper.<ref name=Vanderbilt2/>
