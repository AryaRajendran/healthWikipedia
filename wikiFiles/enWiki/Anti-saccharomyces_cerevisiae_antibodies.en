'''Mannan-binding lectin''' ([[Mannan-binding lectin|MBL]]) is a [[lectin]] produced by humans. In ASCA+ Crohn's disease the serum level of this protein is lower.

ASCA+ is a predictor for Crohn's disease with high specificity and positive predictive value (87% and 78% respectively). ASCA are associated with proximal (gastroduodenal and small bowel involvement) rather than purely colonic disease (P < 0.001) and with a more severe disease phenotype and requirement for surgery over a median follow-up time of 9 years (P < 0.0001).
