It is derived from the Greek ''dys'' meaning bad or disordered, and ''phago'' meaning "eat".

A [[psychogenic disease|psychogenic]] dysphagia is known as [[phagophobia]]. Individuals who suffer from dysphagia are often ordered onto [[thickened fluids]]. The thicker consistency makes it less likely that an individual with dysphagia will [[aspirate]] while they are drinking. Individuals with difficulty swallowing may find liquids cause coughing, spluttering or even choking and thickening drinks enables them to swallow safely. A range of commercial [[thickening agents]] are available to purchase for the dietary management of dysphagia.

It is also worthwhile to refer to the [[swallowing|physiology of swallowing]] in understanding dysphagia.
==Causes==
===Classification===
Dysphagia is classified into two major types:
# [[Oropharyngeal dysphagia]] and
# [[Esophageal dysphagia]].<ref name="titleEvaluating Dysphagia - June 15, 2000 - American Academy of Family Physicians">{{cite journal |author=Spieker MR |title=Evaluating dysphagia |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=61 |issue=12 |pages=3639–48 |year=2000 |month=June |pmid=10892635 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000615/3639.html }}</ref>
# Functional dysphagia is defined in some patients as having no organic cause for dysphagia that can be found.

==Signs and symptoms==
Some patients have limited awareness of their dysphagia, so lack of the symptom does not exclude an underlying disease.<ref name="Logemann" /> When dysphagia goes undiagnosed or untreated, patients are at a high risk of [[pulmonary aspiration]] and subsequent [[aspiration pneumonia]] secondary to food or liquids going the wrong way into the lungs. Some people present with "silent aspiration" and do not cough or show outward signs of aspiration. Undiagnosed dysphagia can also result in dehydration, malnutrition, and renal failure.

Some signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia include difficulty controlling food in the mouth, inability to control food or saliva in the mouth, difficulty initiating a swallow, coughing, choking, frequent [[pneumonia]], unexplained weight loss, gurgly or wet voice after swallowing, nasal regurgitation, and dysphagia (patient complaint of swallowing difficulty).<ref name="Logemann">{{cite book |author=Logemann, Jeri A. |title=Evaluation and treatment of swallowing disorders |publisher=Pro-Ed |location=Austin, Tex |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-89079-728-5 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> When asked where the food is getting stuck, patients will often point to the cervical ([[neck]]) region as the site of the obstruction. The actual site of obstruction is always at or below the level at which the level of obstruction is perceived.

The most common symptom of esophageal dysphagia is the inability to swallow solid food, which the patient will describe as 'becoming stuck' or 'held up' before it either passes into the stomach or is regurgitated.

Pain on swallowing or [[odynophagia]] is a distinctive symptom that can be highly indicative of [[carcinoma]], although it also has numerous other causes that are not related to cancer.

[[Achalasia]] is a major exception to usual pattern of dysphagia in that swallowing of fluid tends to cause more difficulty than swallowing solids. In achalasia, there is idiopathic destruction of parasympathetic ganglia of the auerbach submucosal plexus of the entire esophagus, which results in functional narrowing of the lower [[esophagus]], and peristaltic failure throughout its length.

Dehydration and or undernutrition caused by restrictions may result in [[weight loss]] and worsen the risk of aspiration pneumonia.

==Differential diagnosis==
All causes of dysphagia are considered as differential diagnoses. Some common ones are:
* [[Esophageal atresia]]
* [[Paterson-Kelly syndrome]]
* [[Zenker's diverticulum]]
* Benign strictures
* [[Achalasia]]
* Esophagial diverticula
* [[Scleroderma]]
* Diffuse esophageal spasm
* [[Esophageal web|Webs and rings]]
* Esophageal cancer
* [[Eosinophilic esophagitis]]
* [[Hiatus hernia]], especially paraesophageal type
* [[Dysphagia lusoria]]
* [[Gastroesophageal reflux]]

Esophageal dysphagia is almost always caused by disease in or adjacent to the esophagus but occasionally the lesion is in the pharynx or stomach. In many of the pathological conditions causing dysphagia, the lumen becomes progressively narrowed and indistensible. Initially only fibrous solids cause difficulty but later the problem can extend to all solids and later even to liquids. Patients with difficulty swallowing may benefit from [[thickened fluids]] if the person is more comfortable with those liquids, although, so far, there are no scientific study that proves that those thickened liquids are beneficial.

==Diagnostic approach==
The gold-standard for diagnosing oropharyngeal dysphagia in countries of the Commonwealth are via a modified [[barium swallow]] study or videofluoroscopic swallow study ([[fluoroscopy]]). This is a lateral video (and [[Anteroposterior|AP]] in some cases)  X-ray that provides objective information on bolus transport, safest consistency of bolus (different consistencies including honey, nectar, thin, pudding, puree, regular), and possible head positioning and/or maneuvers that may facilitate swallow function depending on each individual's anatomy and physiology. In Zenker's diverticulum, barium meal first fills the pouch, then overflows from top. In achalasia, it shows "bird-beak" tapering of [[distal]] esophagus. In esophageal cancer, it shows a characteristic filling defect ("Rat-tail" deformity). In leiomyoma, there is smooth filling defect. Reflux can be demonstrated in fluorscopy. In strictures, meal is initially arrested above stricture, then gradually trickles down.

[[Esophagoscopy]] and [[laryngoscopy]] can give direct view of lumens.

[[Chest radiograph]] may show air-fluid level in [[mediastinum]]. [[Pott's disease]] and calcified [[aneurysms]] of aorta can be easily diagnosed.

[[Esophageal motility study]] is useful in cases of achalasia and diffuse esophageal spasms.

[[Cytopathology#Cell collection|Exfoliative cytology]] can be performed on esophageal lavage obtained by esophagoscopy. It can detect malignant cells in early stage.

[[Ultrasonography]] and [[CT scan]] are not very useful in finding cause of dysphagia; but can detect masses in mediastinum and aortic aneurysms.

A FEES (Fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing), sometimes with sensory evaluation, is done usually by a Medical Speech Pathologist or Deglutologist. This procedure involves the patient eating different consistencies as above and further the results are analyzed.

==Epidemiology==
Swallowing disorders can occur in all age groups, resulting from congenital abnormalities, structural damage, and/or medical conditions.<ref name="Logemann"/> Swallowing problems are a common [[complaint]] among older individuals, and the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of dysphagia is higher in the [[elderly]],<ref name="pmid2405269">{{cite journal |author=Shamburek RD, Farrar JT |title=Disorders of the digestive system in the elderly |journal=[[N. Engl. J. Med.]] |volume=322 |issue=7 |pages=438–43 |year=1990 |pmid=2405269 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199002153220705}}</ref> in patients who have had [[stroke]]s,<ref name="pmid16269630">{{cite journal |author=Martino R, Foley N, Bhogal S, Diamant N, Speechley M, Teasell R |title=Dysphagia after stroke: incidence, diagnosis, and pulmonary complications |journal=Stroke |volume=36 |issue=12 |pages=2756–63 |year=2005 |pmid=16269630 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000190056.76543.eb |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16269630}}</ref> and in patients who are admitted to acute care [[hospitals]] or [[chronic care]] facilities.
Dysphagia is a symptom of many different causes, which can usually be elicited through a careful [[history]] by the treating [[physician]]. A formal oropharyngeal dysphagia evaluation is performed by a [[Medical speech pathologist]].<ref name="pmid13617241">{{cite journal |author=Ingelfinger FJ, Kramer P, Soutter L, Schatzki R |title=Panel discussion on diseases of the esophagus |journal=Am.
