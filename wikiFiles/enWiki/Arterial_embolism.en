'''Arterial embolism''' is a sudden interruption of blood flow to an organ or body part due to an [[embolus]] adhering to the wall of an [[artery]] blocking the flow of blood,<ref name=mdguidelines/> the major type of embolus being a blood clot ([[thromboembolism]]). Sometimes, [[pulmonary embolism]] is classified as arterial embolism as well,<ref name=medlineplus>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001102.htm MedlinePlus > Arterial embolism] Sean O. Stitham, MD and David C. Dugdale III, MD. Also reviewed by David Zieve, MD. Reviewed last on: 5/8/2008. Alternative link: [http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/001102.htm]</ref> in the sense that the clot follows the [[pulmonary artery]] carrying deoxygenated blood away from the heart. However, pulmonary embolism is generally classified as a form of venous embolism, because the embolus forms in veins. Arterial embolism is the major cause of [[infarction]] (which may also be caused by e.g. arterial compression, rupture or pathological [[vasoconstriction]]).

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms may begin quickly or slowly depending on the size of the embolus and how much it blocks the blood flow.<ref name=medlineplus/> Symptoms of embolisation in an organ vary with the organ involved but commonly include:
* Pain in the involved body part<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Temporarily<ref name=medlineplus/> decreased organ function

Later symptoms are closely related to [[infarction]] of the affected tissue. This may cause permanently decreased organ function.

For example, symptoms of [[myocardial infarction]] mainly include [[chest pain]], [[dyspnea]], [[diaphoresis]] (an excessive form of [[sweating]]), weakness, [[light-headedness]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[palpitation]]s. 

Symptoms of [[limb infarction]] include coldness,<ref name="mdguidelines"/><ref name="medlineplus"/> decreased or no pulse beyond the site of blockage,<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/> pain,<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/> muscle spasm,<ref name=medlineplus/> numbness and tingling,<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/> [[pallor]]<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/> and [[muscle weakness]],<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/> possibly to the grade of [[paralysis]]<ref name=mdguidelines/> in the affected limb.

===Commonly occluded sites===
Arterial emboli often occur in the legs and feet. Some may occur in the brain, causing a stroke, or in the heart, causing a heart attack. Less common sites include the kidneys, intestines, and eyes.<ref name=medlineplus/>

==Risk factors==
Risk factors for [[thromboembolism]], the major cause of arterial embolism, include disturbed blood flow (such as in [[atrial fibrillation]] and [[mitral stenosis]]), injury or damage to an artery wall, and [[hypercoagulability]]<ref name=mdguidelines/> (such as increased platelet count).<ref name=medlineplus/> [[Mitral stenosis]] poses a high risk of forming emboli which may travel to the brain and cause [[stroke]].<ref name=medlineplus/> [[Endocarditis]] increases the risk for thromboembolism,<ref name=medlineplus/> by a mixture of the factors above.

[[Atherosclerosis]] in the aorta and other large blood vessels is a common risk factor,<ref name=medlineplus/> both for thromboembolism and [[cholesterol embolism]]. The legs and feet are major impact sites for these types.<ref name=medlineplus/> Thus, risk factors for atherosclerosis are risk factors for arterial embolisation as well:
*advanced age<ref name=mdguidelines/>
*[[cigarette smoking]]<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/>
*[[hypertension]] (high blood pressure)
*[[obesity]]<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/>
*[[hyperlipidemia]], e.g. [[hypercholesterolemia]], [[hypertriglyceridemia]], elevated [[lipoprotein (a)]] or [[apolipoprotein B]], or decreased levels of [[high-density lipoprotein|HDL]] cholesterol)<ref name=mdguidelines/>
*[[diabetes mellitus]]<ref name=mdguidelines/>
*[[Sedentary lifestyle]]<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/>
*stress<ref name=medlineplus/>

Other important risk factors for arterial embolism include:
*recent surgery<ref name=mdguidelines/> (both for thromboembolism and air embolism)
*previous stroke or cardiovascular disease<ref name=mdguidelines/>
*a history of long-term intravenous therapy<ref name=mdguidelines/> (for [[air embolism]])
*[[Bone fracture]] (for [[fat embolism]])

A [[septal defect]] of the heart makes it possible for [[paradoxical embolization]], which happens when a clot in a vein enters the right side of the heart and passes through a hole into the left side. The clot can then move to an artery and cause arterial embolisation.<ref name=medlineplus/>

==Pathophysiology==
{{See|Infarction}}
An arterial embolism is caused by one or more emboli getting stuck in an artery and blocking blood flow, causing [[ischemia]], possibly resulting in [[infarction]] with tissue death ([[necrosis]]).<ref name=medlineplus/> Individuals with arterial thrombosis or embolism often develop [[collateral circulation]] to compensate for the loss of arterial flow. However, it takes time for sufficient collateral circulation to develop,<ref name=mdguidelines/> making affected areas more vulnerable for sudden occlusion by embolisation than for e.g. gradual occlusion as in [[atherosclerosis]].<ref name=Kumar4>Chapter 4 in:{{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref>

===Materials===
{{See|Embolism}}
Arterial embolisms can be consist of various materials, including:
* [[Thromboembolism]] – embolism of thrombus or blood clot.<ref name=mdguidelines>[http://www.mdguidelines.com/arterial-embolism-and-thrombosis MDGuidelines > Arterial Embolism And Thrombosis] From ''The Medical Disability Advisor'' by Presley Reed, MD. Retrieved on April 30, 2010</ref>
* [[Cholesterol embolism]] - embolism of cholesterol, often from atherosclerotic plaque inside a vessel.
* [[Fat embolism]] – embolism of bone fracture or fat droplets.<ref name=mdguidelines/>
* [[Air embolism]] (also known as a gas embolism) – embolism of air bubbles.<ref name=mdguidelines/>
* [[Septic embolism]] – embolism of pus-containing bacteria.<ref name=mdguidelines/>
* ''Cancer embolism''<ref name=mdguidelines/>

In contrast, [[amniotic fluid embolism]] almost exclusively affects the venous side.

==Diagnosis==
In addition to evaluating the symptoms above, the health care provider may find decreased or no [[blood pressure]] in the arm or leg.<ref name=mdguidelines/> 

Tests to determine any underlying cause for thrombosis or embolism and to confirm presence of the obstruction may include:
* [[Doppler ultrasound]], especially [[duplex ultrasonography]].<ref name=medlineplus/> It may also involve [[transcranial doppler]] exam of arteries to the brain<ref name=medlineplus/>
* [[Echocardiography]],<ref name=medlineplus/> sometimes involving more specialized techniques such as [[Transesophageal echocardiography]] (TEE)<ref name=medlineplus/> or [[myocardial contrast echocardiography]] (MCE) to diagnose [[myocardial infarction]]<ref name=medlineplus/>
* [[Arteriography]] of the affected extremity or organ<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/> [[Digital subtraction angiography]] is useful in individuals where administration of radiopaque contrast material must be kept to a minimum.<ref name=mdguidelines/>
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI)<ref name=medlineplus/>
* [[Blood test]]s for measuring elevated enzymes in the blood, including cardiac-specific [[troponin T]] and/or [[troponin I]], [[myoglobins]], and [[creatine kinase]] isoenzymes.<ref name=mdguidelines/>  These indicate embolisation to the heart that has caused [[myocardial infarction]]. Myoglobins and creatine kinase are also elevated in the blood in embolisation in other locations.
*[[Blood cultures]] may be done to identify the organism responsible for any causative infection<ref name=mdguidelines/>
* [[Electrocardiography]] (ECG) for detecting [[myocardial infarction]]<ref name=mdguidelines/>
* [[Angioscopy]] using a flexible [[fiberoptic catheter]] inserted directly into an artery.<ref name=mdguidelines/>

==Prevention==
Prevention of [[atherosclerosis]], which is a major risk factor of arterial embolism, can be performed e.g. by [[dieting]], [[physical exercise]] and [[smoking cessation]].

In case of high risk for developing thromboembolism, antithrombotic medication such as [[warfarin]] or [[coumadin]] may be taken prophylactically. [[Antiplatelet]] drugs may also be needed.<ref name=medlineplus/>

==Treatment==
Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms and improving the interrupted blood flow to the affected area of the body.<ref name=medlineplus/>

Medications include:
* [[Antithrombotic]] medication. These are commonly given because thromboembolism is the major cause of arterial embolism. Examples are:
** [[Anticoagulant]]s (such as [[warfarin]] or [[heparin]]) and [[antiplatelet medication]] (such as [[aspirin]], [[ticlopidine]], and [[clopidogrel]]) can prevent new clots from forming<ref name=medlineplus/>
** [[Thrombolytic]]s (such as [[streptokinase]]) can dissolve clots<ref name=medlineplus/>
* [[Painkiller]]s given [[intravenous]]ly<ref name=medlineplus/>
* [[Vasodilator]]s to relax and dilate blood vessels.<ref name=mdguidelines/>
Appropriate drug treatments successfully produces thrombolysis and removal of the clot in 50% to 80% of all cases.<ref name=mdguidelines/>

Antithrombotic agents may be administered directly onto the clot in the vessel using a flexible catheter (''intra-arterial thrombolysis'').<ref name=mdguidelines/> Intra-arterial thrombolysis reduces thromboembolic occlusion by 95% in 50% of cases, and restores adequate blood flow in 50% to 80% of cases.<ref name=mdguidelines/> 

Surgical procedures include:
* Arterial [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass]] surgery to create another source of blood supply<ref name=medlineplus/>
* [[Embolectomy]], to remove the embolus, with various techniques available:
** [[Thromboaspiration]]<ref name=medlineplus/>
** [[Angioplasty]] with [[balloon catheter]]ization with or without implanting a [[stent]]<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/> Balloon catheterization or open embolectomy surgery reduces mortality by nearly 50%<ref name=mdguidelines/> and the need for limb amputation by approximately 35%.<ref name=mdguidelines/>
** Embolectomy by open surgery on the artery<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/>

If extensive necrosis and gangrene has set in an arm or leg, the limb may have to be [[amputated]].<ref name=mdguidelines/> Limb amputation is in itself usually remarkably well tolerated, but is associated with a substantial mortality (~50%), primarily because of the severity of the diseases in patients where it is indicated.<ref name=mdguidelines/>

==Prognosis==
How well a patient does depends on the location of the clot and to what extent the clot has blocked blood flow. Arterial embolism can be serious if not treated promptly.<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/>

Without treatment, it has a 25% to 30% [[mortality rate]].<ref name=mdguidelines/> The affected area can be permanently damaged, and up to approximately 25%<ref name=mdguidelines/><ref name=medlineplus/> of cases require amputation of an affected extremity.

Arterial emboli may recur even after successful treatment.<ref name=medlineplus/>

==Complications==
Possible complications of arterial embolism depend on the site of the obstruction:
* In the heart it can cause [[myocardial infarction]]<ref name=medlineplus/>
* In the brain, it can cause a [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA),<ref name=medlineplus/> and, in prolonged blood obstruction, [[stroke]].<ref name=medlineplus/><ref name=medlineplus/>
* Blockage of arteries that supply arms or legs may result in necrosis and [[gangrene]]<ref name=mdguidelines/>
* Temporary or permanent decrease or loss of other organ functions<ref name=medlineplus/>
* In [[septic embolism]], there can be infection of the affected tissue or even septic shock,<ref name=medlineplus/>

==Epidemiology==
In the [[United States]], approximately 550,000 people die each year from heart-related arterial embolism and thrombosis.<ref name=mdguidelines/> Approximately 250,000 of these individuals are female,<ref name=mdguidelines/> and approximately 100,000 of all these deaths are considered premature, that is, prior to the age of average life expectancy.<ref name=mdguidelines/>
