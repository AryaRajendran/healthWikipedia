'''School health services''' are services from medical, teaching and other professionals applied in or out of school to improve the health and well-being of children and in some cases whole families.  These services have been developed in different ways around the globe but the fundamentals are constant: the early detection, correction, prevention or amelioration of disease, disability and abuse from which school aged children can suffer.

==Background==
It was shown by [[statistics]] that many [[pupil]]s were backward in their studies only because of lack of physical vitality. In 1920, it was shown that so many pupils in the schools of [[Brooklyn, New York]], were compelled to pass through the same grades twice that, at the average cost of $40 a term for each pupil, the [[borough]] lost $2,000,000. On this basis various [[social organization]]s demanded an [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]] from the city of $100,000 for more effective medical aid to the school children, contending that more than half of the extra expense could thus be saved. Out of 252,000 school-children inspected in [[New York City]] in 1919, 74% were found defective physically, defective teeth and vision being the chief faults.<ref name="colliers">{{Cite Collier's|Schools, Medical inspection of|year=1921}}</ref>

==Unesco Tools==
Unesco has published a set of tools, to support the [[FRESH, UNESCO|FRESH]] framework, to guide those wishing to set up school health services around the world.  Designed primarily for developing nations, these tools can be of universal use [http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35173&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html].The main emphasis of these tool is on: 
*[[HIV/AIDS]]
*Food and nutrition
*[[Helminths]] and hygiene
*[[Malaria]]
*Violence
*[[Drugs]], [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]]

==United States==
School health services are well developed in the United States. Central guidelines are provided by ''Making Health Academic'' but each state and within that each [[school board]] has adopted its own specific methods.

===Making Health Academic [http://www2.edc.org/makinghealthacademic/about.asp]===
This is a five year project funded by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]'s Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) designed to enable all schools to be part of a co-ordinated school health program. The project is built around the fact that six preventable behaviours, mainly learned in [[childhood]] and [[youth]], account for most of the serious illnesses and premature deaths in the United States; these are:[http://www2.edc.org/makinghealthacademic/cshp.asp#rationale]

===Examples of existing services===
*[[Massachusetts]]. An example from a maritime state is [http://www.mass.gov/dph/fch/schoolhealth/index.htm] where a typical mission statement starts "School Health Services fosters the growth, development and educational achievement of Massachusetts' students by promoting their health and wellbeing ... "
*[[New Mexico]]. An example from a southern state is [http://www.healthierschools.org/] where an interesting "[[yucca]] model of coordinated school health" is used to help visualize the inter-relationship of the services.

==United Kingdom==
The health of children and youth in the UK is mainly the responsibility of the [[National Health Service|NHS]], for example child health screening [http://www.nsc.nhs.uk/ch_screen/child_ind.htm] and advice for parents of overweight children [http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=823]. School based services are therefore more limited than in the US.

===Examples of existing services===
*[[England]] - Warrington [http://www.warrington.gov.uk/learning/school_health.asp]
*[[Northern Ireland]] [http://www.sebt.n-i.nhs.uk/index2.html]
*[[Scotland]] [http://www.sciennes.edin.sch.uk/handbook/healthservice.html]

==Other countries==
School health systems are expanding in low- and middle-income countries. Information on school health in these countries is collated on the Schools and Health website [http://www.schoolsandhealth.org] maintained by the [[Partnership for Child Development]].  A database of School Health and Nutrition (SHN) Programmes in low and middle income countries can be found on the site:

==History==
[[Inspection (medicine)|Medical inspection]] in schools was first instituted in [[France]] in 1886, then, in succession, this example was followed by [[Belgium]], [[Hungary]], [[Chile]], [[Germany]] and [[Great Britain]], the latter in 1908. In the United States, medical inspection in schools was first instituted in [[New York City]] in 1892, then in [[Boston]] in 1894, in [[Chicago]] in 1895, and in [[Philadelphia]] in 1898.<ref name="colliers"/>
