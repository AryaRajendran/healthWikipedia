'''Typhus''' is any of several similar [[infectious disease|disease]]s caused by ''[[Rickettsia]]'' bacteria.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000112663|Typhus}}</ref> The name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''typhos'' (τῦφος) meaning smoky or hazy, describing the state of mind of those affected with typhus. The causative organism ''Rickettsia'' is an [[obligate parasite]] bacterium that cannot survive for long outside living cells.  Typhus should not be confused with [[typhoid fever]]. While "typhoid" means "typhus-like", the diseases are distinct and are caused by different species of bacteria.

==Overview==
Multiple diseases include the word "typhus" in their description. Types include:

The first reliable description of the disease appears during the Spanish siege of [[Moorish]] [[Granada]] in 1489. These accounts include descriptions of fever and red spots over arms, back, and chest, progressing to delirium, [[gangrenous]] sores, and the stink of rotting flesh. During the siege, the Spaniards lost 3,000 men to enemy action, but an additional 17,000 died of typhus. 

Typhus was also common in prisons, where it was known as 'gaol fever' or 'jail fever', and often occurs when prisoners are frequently huddled together in dark, filthy rooms where lice spread easily. Thus, "Imprisonment until the next term of court" was often equivalent to a death sentence.  It was so infectious, prisoners brought before the court sometimes infected the court itself.<ref name="Ralph D. Smith 1967">Ralph D. Smith, Comment, Criminal Law -- Arrest -- The Right to Resist Unlawful Arrest, 7 NAT. RESOURCES J. 119, 122 n.16 (1967) (hereinafter Comment) (citing John Howard, The State of Prisons 6–7 (1929)) (Howard's observations are from 1773 to 1775). Copied from State v.

Following the Assize held at [[Oxford]] in 1577, later deemed the [[Black Assize]], over 300 died from epidemic typhus, including [[Sir Robert Bell (Knight)|Sir Robert Bell]], Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer.  During the Lent [[Assize Court]] held at [[Taunton]] (1730), typhus caused the death of the [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer|Lord Chief Baron]], as well as the [[High Sheriff of Somerset|High Sheriff]], the sergeant, and hundreds of others. During a time when there were 241 capital offenses, more prisoners died from 'gaol fever' than were put to death by all the public executioners in the British realm.  In 1759, an English authority estimated that each year a quarter of the prisoners had died from gaol fever.<ref name="Ralph D. Smith 1967"/> In [[London]], typhus frequently broke out among the ill-kept prisoners of [[Newgate Gaol]] and then moved into the general city population.

Epidemics occurred routinely throughout Europe from the 16th to the 19th centuries, and occurred during the [[English Civil War]], the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence]. ''TIME''</ref> Pestilence of several kinds raged among combatants and civilians in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] and surrounding lands from 1618 to 1648. According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, "By war's end, typhus may have killed more than 10 percent of the total German population, and disease in general accounted for 90 percent of Europe's casualties."<ref>{{Cite book |first=Joseph Patrick |last=Byrne |title=Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues: A—M |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&pg=PA732 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2008 |page=732 |isbn=0-313-34102-8 }}</ref>

=== 19th century ===

During [[Napoleon]]'s [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|retreat from]] [[Moscow]] in 1812, more [[France|French]] soldiers died of typhus than were killed by the [[Russia]]ns.<ref>[http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/TYPHUS-Conlon.pdf The Historical Impact of Epidemic Typhus]. Joseph M. Conlon.</ref>

A major epidemic occurred in [[Ireland]] between 1816 and 1819, during the famine caused by a world-wide reduction in temperature known as the [[Year Without a Summer]].  An estimated 100,000 Irish perished.  Typhus appeared again in the late 1830s, and yet another major typhus epidemic occurred during the [[Great Irish Famine]] between 1846 and 1849. The Irish typhus spread to England, where it was sometimes called "Irish fever" and was noted for its virulence. It killed people of all social classes, as lice were endemic and inescapable, but it hit particularly hard in the lower or "unwashed" social strata.

In [[United States|America]], a typhus [[epidemic]] killed the son of [[Franklin Pierce]] (14th President of the United States) in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] in 1843, and struck in [[Philadelphia]] in 1837. Several epidemics occurred in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[Washington DC]] between 1865 and 1873. Typhus was also a significant killer during the US Civil War, although [[typhoid]] fever was the more prevalent cause of US Civil War "camp fever". Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhii (not to be confused with Salmonella ''enterica'', the cause of Salmonella food poisoning), is a completely different disease from typhus. 

In Canada alone, the [[typhus epidemic of 1847]] killed more than 20,000 people from 1847 to 1848, mainly Irish immigrants in [[fever shed]]s and other forms of quarantine, who had contracted the disease aboard [[coffin ships]].<ref name=mccord1>{{cite web|title=M993X.5.1529.1 {{!}} The government inspector's office|url=http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/M993X.5.1529.1|work=[[McCord Museum]]|accessdate=22 January 2012|location=[[Montreal]]}}</ref>

=== 20th century ===

[[File:Charles Nicolle at microscope.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Charles Nicolle]] received the 1928 [[Nobel Prize]] in Medicine for his identification of lice as the transmitter of epidemic typhus.]]
Delousing stations were established for troops on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western front]] during [[World War I]], but the disease ravaged the armies of the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern front]], with over 150,000 dying in [[Serbia]] alone. Fatalities were generally between 10 and 40% of those infected, and the disease was a major cause of death for those nursing the sick. 
In 1922, the typhus epidemic reached its peak, with some 25-30 million cases in [[Russia]] and 4 million cases in [[Poland]].<ref>Paul Weindling. ''International Health Organisations and Movements, 1918-1939''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. 1995. p. 99.</ref> In [[Russia]], during the [[Russian civil war|civil war]] between the [[White Army|White]] and [[Red Army|Red armies]], typhus killed three million people,<ref>Andrew W. Artenstein. ''Vaccines: A Biography''. Springer. 2010. p. 250.</ref><ref>David G. Rempel. ''A Mennonite Family in Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union, 1789-1923''. [[University of Toronto Press]]. 2011. p. 249.</ref> largely civilians.
During [[World War II]], many German POWs after the [[battle of Stalingrad|loss at Stalingrad]] died of typhus.  Typhus epidemics killed those confined to POW camps, ghettos and inmates in the [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi Germany concentration camps]] who were held in unhygienic conditions.  Pictures of typhus victims' mass graves can be seen in footage shot at [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]].<ref name="Mazal1">[http://www.mazal.org/archive/nmt/01/NMT01-T508.htm ''Nuernberg Military Tribunal, Volume I''] pp. 508–511</ref> 

Among thousands of prisoners in concentration camps such as Theresienstadt and Bergen-Belsen who died of typhus <ref name="Mazal1"/> were [[Anne Frank]], at the age of 15, and her sister Margot, at the age of 19. Even larger epidemics in the postwar chaos of Europe were only averted by the widespread use of the newly discovered [[DDT]] to kill the lice on millions of refugees and displaced persons.

The first typhus vaccine was developed by the [[Polish people|Polish]] [[zoologist]] [[Rudolf Weigl]] in the period between the two world wars.<ref>Naomi Baumslag, ''Murderous medicine: Nazi doctors, human experimentation, and Typhus'', [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Qk3lIumGHd8C&pg=PA133 page 133]</ref> Better, less dangerous and less expensive vaccines were developed during World War II.

Since then, some epidemics have occurred in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and parts of [[Africa]].

==Contemporary society==
According to the [[World Health Organization]], typhus continues to kill a weighted average of about 0.2 people per million, per year.<ref>[http://www.who.int/whosis/en/ WHO Statistical Information System (WHOSIS)]</ref>

==Prevention==
The most effective way to prevent Typhus is to receive the [[typhus vaccine]] series before traveling to endemic areas and to avoid contact with fleas.

==Treatment==
Without treatment, the disease can be fatal. Prompt treatment with [[antibiotics]] cures most patients.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001363.htm Typhus], ''MedLine'', [[National Institutes of Health]]</ref>
* [[Azithromycin]] (one-drug therapy)
* [[Doxycycline]]
* [[Tetracycline]]
* [[Chloramphenicol]] (less common)
