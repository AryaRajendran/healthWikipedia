In [[immunology]], an '''adjuvant''' is an agent that may stimulate the [[immune system]] and increase the response to a [[vaccine]], without having any specific [[antigen]]ic effect in itself.<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/templates/db_alpha.aspx?CdrID=43987 Definition of Adjuvant], National Cancer Institute.</ref> The word “adjuvant” comes from the Latin word ''adiuvare'', meaning to help or aid.<ref>[http://www.springerlink.com/content/m823465l9p126826/ ''DNA Vaccines: Methods and Protocols,''] D.B.

Adjuvants have been whimsically called the ''dirty little secret'' of vaccines<ref>[http://www.thescientist.com/article/display/39377/ The Scientist] "Deciphering Immunology's Dirty Secret." (subscription required)</ref> in the scientific community. This dates from the early days of commercial vaccine manufacture, when significant variations in the effectiveness of different batches of the same vaccine were observed, correctly assumed  to be due to contamination of the reaction vessels. However, it was soon found that more scrupulous attention to cleanliness actually seemed to ''reduce'' the effectiveness of the vaccines, and that the contaminants &ndash; "dirt" &ndash; actually enhanced the immune response. There are many known adjuvants in widespread use, including oils, aluminium salts, and [[virosome]]s.

==Overview==
Adjuvants in [[immunology]] are often used to modify or augment the effects of a [[vaccine]] by stimulating the [[immune system]] to [[immune response|respond]] to the vaccine more vigorously, and thus providing increased immunity to a particular [[disease]]. Adjuvants accomplish this task by mimicking specific sets of [[evolutionarily]] conserved molecules, so called [[Pathogen-associated molecular pattern|PAMP]]s, which include [[liposomes]], [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS), molecular cages for [[antigen]], components of bacterial [[cell walls]], and endocytosed nucleic acids such as double-stranded [[RNA]] ([[dsRNA]]), single-stranded DNA ([[ssDNA]]), and [[CpG Oligodeoxynucleotide|unmethylated CpG]] dinucleotide-containing [[DNA]].<ref name="Gavin">{{cite journal |author=Gavin A, Hoebe K, Duong B, Ota T, Martin C, Beutler B, Nemazee D |title=Adjuvant-enhanced antibody responses occur without Toll-like receptor signaling |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5807 |pages=1936–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17185603 |doi=10.1126/science.1135299 |pmc=1868398|bibcode = 2006Sci...314.1936G }}</ref> Because immune systems have [[evolved]] to recognize these specific [[antigenic]] [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]], the presence of an adjuvant in conjunction with the vaccine can greatly increase the [[innate immune response]] to the antigen by augmenting the activities of [[dendritic cells]] (DCs), [[lymphocytes]], and [[macrophages]] by mimicking a [[natural]] [[infection]].<ref>Majde JA. 1987.

===Inorganic adjuvants===

====Aluminium salts====
There are many adjuvants, some of which are [[inorganic]] (such as [[alum]]), that also carry the potential to augment [[immunogenicity]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clements C, Griffiths E |title=The global impact of vaccines containing aluminium adjuvants |journal=Vaccine |volume=20 Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=S24–33 |year= 2002|pmid=12184361}}</ref><ref>Glenny A, Pope C, Waddington H, and Wallace U. 1926.

These are the most common adjuvants in human vaccines.

===Organic adjuvants===
While Aluminium salts are popularly used in human vaccines, the organic compound [[squalene]] is also used (e.g. [[AS03]]). However, organic adjuvants are more commonly used in animal vaccines.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

====Oil-based====

Oil-based adjuvants are commonly used in some veterinary vaccines.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[MF59]] is an 'oil [squalene] in water' adjuvant used in some human vaccines.

===Virosomes===
Another market-approved adjuvant and carrier system are [[virosomes]].<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TD4-3Y44SRT-4K&_user=606406&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F1995&_fmt=full&_orig=search&_cdi=5188&view=c&_acct=C000029798&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=606406&md5=29035d9b4bf92526c125f3e6e99de680&ref=full "Safety, immunogenicity, and kinetics of the immune response to a single dose of virosome-formulated hepatitis A vaccine in Thais,"] Yong Poovorawana, Apiradee Theamboonlersa, Saowani Chumdermpadetsuka, Reinhard Glückb and Stanley J.

In contrast, the adjuvant capabilities of virosomes are independent of any inflammatory reaction. Virosomes contain a membrane-bound [[hemagglutinin]] and [[neuraminidase]] derived from the influenza virus, and serve to amplify fusogenic activity and therefore facilitate the uptake into antigen presenting cells (APC) and induce a natural antigen-processing pathway.  The delivery of the antigen by virosomes to the immune system in a way that mimics a natural path may be a reason why virosome-based vaccines stand out due to their excellent safety profile.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TD4-3VW86PK-2G&_user=606406&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000029798&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=606406&md5=d4e5e5e32cb4b693078ac4464e16459a "Adjuvant activity of immunopotentiating reconstituted influenza virosomes (IRIVs),"] Reinhard Glück, ''Vaccine,''

===Experimental adjuvants===
An increasing number of vaccines with [[squalene]] and phosphate adjuvants are being tested on humans.<ref>[http://www.annalsnyas.org/cgi/content/abstract/754/1/153 "Immunologic adjuvants for modern vaccine formulations,"] F.

Some dosages will contain Chiron’s MF59 adjuvant—a substance designed to boost the vaccine’s protective effect."</ref>

== Adjuvants and the adaptive immune response ==

In order to understand the links between the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response to help substantiate an adjuvant function in enhancing adaptive immune responses to the specific antigen of a vaccine, the following points should be considered:  

* Innate immune response cells such as [[Dendritic Cell]]s (DCs) engulf [[pathogens]] through a process called [[phagocytosis]].
* DCs then migrate to the [[lymph nodes]] where [[T cells]] (adaptive immune cells) wait for signals to trigger their activation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bousso P, Robey E |title=Dynamics of CD8+ T cell priming by dendritic cells in intact lymph nodes |journal=Nat Immunol |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=579–85 |year=2003 |pmid=12730692 |doi=10.1038/ni928}}</ref>
* In the lymph nodes, DCs mince the engulfed pathogen and then express the pathogen clippings as antigen on their [[Cell (biology)|cell]] surface by coupling them to a special receptor known as a [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC).
* T cells can then recognize these clippings and undergo a [[cellular transformation]] resulting in their own activation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mempel T, Henrickson S, Von Andrian U |title=T-cell priming by dendritic cells in lymph nodes occurs in three distinct phases |journal=Nature |volume=427 |issue=6970 |pages=154–9 |year=2004 |pmid=14712275 |doi=10.1038/nature02238}}</ref>
* [[γδ T cells]] possess characteristics of both the innate and adaptive immune responses.
* [[Macrophages]] can also activate T cells in a similar approach (but do not do so naturally).

This process carried out by both DCs and macrophages is termed [[antigen presentation]] and represents a physical link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. 

Upon activation, [[mast cells]] release [[heparin]] and [[histamine]] to effectively increase trafficking to and seal off the site of [[infection]] to allow immune cells of both systems to clear the area of pathogens. In addition, mast cells also release [[chemokines]] which result in the positive [[chemotaxis]] of other immune cells of both the innate and adaptive immune responses to the infected area.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gaboury J, Johnston B, Niu X, Kubes P |title=Mechanisms underlying acute mast cell-induced leukocyte rolling and adhesion in vivo |journal=J Immunol |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=804–13 |year=1995 |pmid=7814884}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kashiwakura J, Yokoi H, Saito H, Okayama Y |title=T cell proliferation by direct cross-talk between OX40 ligand on human mast cells and OX40 on human T cells: comparison of gene expression profiles between human tonsillar and lung-cultured mast cells |journal=J Immunol |volume=173 |issue=8 |pages=5247–57 |year=2004 |pmid=15470070}}</ref>

Due to the variety of mechanisms and links between the innate and adaptive immune response, an adjuvant-enhanced innate immune response results in an enhanced adaptive immune response.  Specifically, adjuvants may exert their immune-enhancing effects according to five immune-functional activities.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schijns V |title=Immunological concepts of vaccine adjuvant activity |journal=Curr Opin Immunol |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=456–63 |year=2000 |pmid=10899018 |doi=10.1016/S0952-7915(00)00120-5}}</ref>  
* First, adjuvants may help in the translocation of [[antigens]] to the [[lymph nodes]] where they can be recognized by [[T cells]].  This will ultimately lead to greater T cell activity resulting in a heightened [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]] of [[pathogen]] throughout the [[organism]].
* Second, adjuvants may provide physical protection to antigens which grants the antigen a prolonged delivery.  This means that the organism will be exposed to the antigen for a longer duration, making the immune system more [[:wikt:robust|robust]] as it makes use of the additional time by upregulating the production of B and T cells needed for greater immunological [[memory]] in the adaptive immune response.
* Third, adjuvants may help to increase the capacity to cause local reactions at the [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] site (during vaccination), inducing greater release of danger signals by [[chemokine]] releasing cells such as [[helper T cells]] and [[mast cells]].
* Fourth, they may induce the release of inflammatory cytokines which helps to not only recruit B and T cells at sites of [[infection]] but also to increase [[transcriptional]] events leading to a net increase of [[immune cells]] as a whole.
* Finally, adjuvants are believed to increase the innate immune response to antigen by interacting with [[pattern recognition receptors]] (PRRs) on or within accessory cells.

== Adjuvants and toll-like receptors ==

The ability of immune system to recognize [[molecule]]s that are broadly shared by [[pathogen]]s is, in part, due to the presence of [[Immune receptor]]s called [[TLRs]] that are expressed on the [[Cell membrane|membrane]]s of [[leukocyte]]s and other cells. TLRs were first discovered in [[drosophila]], and are membrane bound [[pattern recognition receptor]]s (PRRs) responsible for detecting most (although certainly not all) antigen-mediated infections.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lemaitre B, Nicolas E, Michaut L, Reichhart J, Hoffmann J |title=The dorsoventral regulatory gene cassette spätzle/Toll/cactus controls the potent antifungal response in Drosophila adults |journal=Cell |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=973–83 |year=1996 |pmid=8808632 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80172-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Beutler B |title=Inferences, questions and possibilities in Toll-like receptor signalling |journal=Nature |volume=430 |issue=6996 |pages=257–63 |year=2004 |pmid=15241424 |doi=10.1038/nature02761|bibcode = 2004Natur.430..257B }}</ref> 
In fact, some studies have shown that in the absence of [[TLR]], [[leukocytes]] become unresponsive (no inflammatory responses) to some [[microbial]] components such as [[LPS]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poltorak A, He X, Smirnova I, Liu M, Van Huffel C, Du X, Birdwell D, Alejos E, Silva M, Galanos C, Freudenberg M, Ricciardi-Castagnoli P, Layton B, Beutler B |title=Defective LPS signaling in C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice: mutations in Tlr4 gene |journal=Science |volume=282 |issue=5396 |pages=2085–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9851930 |doi=10.1126/science.282.5396.2085 |bibcode=1998Sci...282.2085P}}</ref> There are at least thirteen different forms of TLR, each with its own characteristic [[ligand]].

Upon activation, TLRs recruit [[adapter proteins]] (proteins that mediate other protein-protein interactions) within the [[cytosol]] of the [[immune cell]] in order to propagation the antigen-induced [[signal transduction pathway]].  To date, four adapter proteins have been well-characterized.  These proteins are known as [[MyD88]], [[Trif]], [[Tram]] and [[TIRAP]] (also called Mal).<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1139/m66-143 | last1 = Berczi | first1 = I | last2 = Bertok | first2 = L | last3 = Bereznai | first3 = T. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1966 | title = Comparative studies on the toxicity of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide endotoxin in various animal species | url = | journal = Can.

Some of these events lead to [[cytokine]] production, [[Cell growth|proliferation]], and survival, while others lead to greater adaptive immunity.<ref name="Medzhitov" />  The high [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensitivity]] of TLR for [[microbial]] ligands is what makes adjuvants that mimic TLR ligands such a prime candidate for enhancing the overall effects of antigen specific vaccinations on [[immunological]] memory. 
 
Finally, the expression of TLRs is vast as they are found on the [[cell membranes]] of innate immune cells (DCs, [[macrophages]], [[natural killer cells]]), cells of the adaptive immunity (T and B lymphocytes) and non immune cells ([[epithelial]] and [[endothelial cells]], [[fibroblasts]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Delneste Y, Beauvillain C, Jeannin P |title=Innate immunity: structure and function of TLRs |journal=Med Sci (Paris) |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=67–73 |year=2007 |pmid=17212934 |doi=10.1051/medsci/200723167}}</ref> 

This further substantiates the importance of administering [[vaccines]] with adjuvants in the form of TLR ligands, as they will be capable of eliciting their positive effects across the entire spectrum of innate and adaptive immunity.  Nevertheless, there are adjuvants whose immune-stimulatory function completely bypasses the TLR signaling pathway.  While all TLR ligands are adjuvants, not all adjuvants are TLR ligands.

Recently, the premise that TLR signaling acts as the key node in antigen-mediated [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] responses has been in question as [[researchers]] have observed antigen-mediated inflammatory responses in [[leukocytes]] in the absence of TLR signaling.<ref name="Gavin" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wickelgren I |title=Immunology. Mouse studies question importance of toll-like receptors to vaccines |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5807 |pages=1859–60 |year=2006 |pmid=17185572 |doi=10.1126/science.314.5807.1859a}}</ref> One [[researcher]] found that in the absence of [[MyD88]] and [[Trif]] (essential [[adapter]] proteins in TLR signaling), they were still able to induce inflammatory responses, increase T cell activation and generate greater [[B cell]] abundancy using conventional adjuvants ([[alum]], [[Freund's adjuvant|Freund’s complete adjuvant]], [[Freund's adjuvant|Freund’s incomplete adjuvant]], and monophosphoryl-lipid A/trehalose dicorynomycolate ([[Polyclonal antibodies#Ribi Adjuvant System|Ribi's adjuvant]])).<ref name="Gavin" />

These observations suggest that although TLR activation can lead to increases in antibody responses, TLR activation is not required to induce enhanced innate and adaptive responses to antigens.  

[[Medical research|Investigating]] the [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] which underlie TLR signaling has been significant in understanding why adjuvants used during vaccinations are so important in augmenting adaptive immune responses to specific [[antigens]].  However, with the knowledge that TLR activation is not required for the immune-enhancing effects caused by common adjuvants, we can conclude that there are, in all likelihood, other receptors besides TLRs that have not yet been characterized, opening the door to future [[research]].

==Vaccine adjuvant database==
Vaxjo is a newly published, web-based vaccine adjuvant database.<ref name="vaxjo">{{cite journal|last=Sayers|first=S|coauthors=Ulysse, G, Xiang, Z, He, Y|title=Vaxjo: a web-based vaccine adjuvant database and its application for analysis of vaccine adjuvants and their uses in vaccine development.|journal=Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology|year=2012|volume=2012|pages=831486|pmid=22505817}}</ref> Vaxjo curates, stores, and analyzes vaccine adjuvants and their usages in vaccine development. Basic information of a vaccine adjuvant stored in Vaxjo includes: adjuvant name, components, structure, appearance, storage, preparation, function, safety, and vaccines that use this adjuvant. All information stored in Vaxjo is well curated and cited from reliable references. Currently over 100 vaccine adjuvants have been annotated in Vaxjo. These adjuvants have been used in over 380 vaccines against over 81 pathogens, cancers, or allergies.
