'''Sammy Lee''' (born '''Samuel Lee''', 1958 – July 21, 2012) was an expert on [[fertility]]<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/13/motherhood-fertility-treatment-cancer-ivf] [[The Guardian]] "Women are risking their lives to have IVF babies" Sep 13 2009</ref> and [[in vitro fertilisation]]<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article6840672.ece] [[The Times]] "Paying poor women for eggs is 'a Kind of Prostitution' says expert" Sep 19 2009</ref>

He was a hospital scientific consultant and was the chief scientist at the Wellington IVF programme.<ref>[http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article6843074.ece] [[The Times]] "Why are older mothers still taboo? Sep 22 2009</ref> His book ''Counselling in Male Infertility'' was published in 1996; he contributed to major newspaper articles and appeared on several current affairs television programmes. He was the "inspiration" for ''Anthony Ling'', the character in the novel ''One Life'' by Rebecca Frayn (Simon & Schuster 2006, ISBN 0-7432-6876-8), after the author herself sought Lee's help for IVF treatment.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/rebecca-frayn-i-just-wanted-a-baby-i-didnt-even-care-if-it-put-my-life-in-danger-1779255.html] [[The Independent]] Rebecca Frayn Interview Aug 30 2009</ref>

In 2010, ''Willing to Die for It'', Lee's biography by [[Frances Lynn]] was published by [[Murray Print]].<ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-9539089-1-2 |last=Lynn |first=Frances |year=2010 |publisher=Murray Print |title=Willing To Die For It}}</ref>

==Current research==
Lee's interests lay in the field of [[stem cell]] biology and [[regenerative medicine]]. He was a visiting professor at the [[University College London]] where he collaborated with various groups in the Anatomy Department examining the potential of [[bone marrow]] derived [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s to give rise to [[neuronal]]/[[glial]] lineages in response to various [[growth factors]] and [[tissue culture]] manipulations. 15:12, 23 July 2012 (UTC) He also taught ethics of biomedicine at [[University College London]].

In addition, he was interested in tissue engineering and teaching ethics in reproduction. He was attached to the Jessen-Mirsky laboratory and was studying remyelination. Lee had ethical committee approval in Brasil for creating artificial gametes from umbilical cord blood derived stem cells. It is hoped these will be used to overcome infertility.<ref>

==Biography==
Lee originally researched his Ph.D. at UCL under the supervision of Professor Ricardo Miledo FRS in the school of [[Sir Bernard Katz]].<ref>
[http://ep.physoc.org/content/74/1/local/front-matter.pdf] The School of Sir Bernard Katz</ref> Lee was also a signatory to a memento presented to [[Sir Bernard Katz]] on his 80th birthday from bona fide members of the school-occasion when the phrase "School of Katz" was coined.<ref>[http://www.recensionidilibri.it/8886062559] Lee provided an anecdote about Sir Bernard Katz and Ricardo Miledi. ISBN 88-86062-55-9 Published by CESI</ref>

Lee first published research in [[Neuroscience]] during the 1980s (from the [[Biophysics]] department at UCL), having worked on nerve muscle interaction ranging from examining TTX-resistant action potentials in denervated muscle <ref>
[http://ep.physoc.org/content/72/4/601.abstract] S Lee, R Miledi, F Ruzzier. (1987).

J Neuroscience Res. 18, 519-524.</ref> following up on the work first done in the same department by Bill Betz and [[Bert Sakmann]].<ref>Betz, W.J. & Sakmann, B. (1971). "Disjunction" of frog neuromuscular synapses by treatment with proteolytic enzymes.

Physiol | volume = 230 | issue = 3| pages = 673–688 | pmid = 4352108 | pmc = 1350622 }}</ref> Lee changed his focus to embryos, when he realised that many of the questions framed by his [[Neuroscience]] research were rooted in the matter of differentiation. The ultimate undifferentiated cell is the fertilised egg. This led Lee to work on [[gap junction]]s in early mammalian embryos (in the Anatomy & Embryology department at UCL), where work with [[Anne Warner (scientist)|Anne Warner]] FRS and [[Anne McLaren]] DBE FRS produced new information on factors affecting communication between cells and their developmental potential.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Buehr M, Lee S, McLaren A, Warner A | year = 1987 | title = Reduced gap junctional communication is associated with the lethal condition characteristic of DDK mouse eggs fertilized by foreign sperm | url = | journal = Development | volume = 101 | issue = 3| pages = 449–459 | pmid = 3502992 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Lee S, Gilula NB, Warner A | year = 1987 | title = Gap junctional communication and compaction during preimplantation stages of mouse development | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 51 | issue = 5| pages = 851–860 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(87)90108-5 | pmid = 3677175 }}</ref> 

Lee became a clinical embryologist in 1985, when working with the gynaecologist Ian Craft<ref>[[The Daily Telegraph]] Letter from Ian Craft when he and Sammy Lee worked at the Wellington [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/3584154/No-allusions.html]</ref> he directed the IVF laboratory at the [[Wellington Hospital, United Kingdom|Wellington Hospital]] in [[London]], then one of the largest units in the world. Consultancy work with the UK division of Ares Serono (1986–1994) also involved work with the Bourn Hallam Group, which [[Patrick Steptoe]] and [[Bob Edwards]] had set up after [[Louise Brown]]'s birth. From 1995 to 2002 he was based at the [[Portland Hospital]] for Women & Children.<ref>[http://www.cdb.ucl.ac.uk/academics/lee/index.shtml Official UCL page]</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990808/ai_n14493048/ Portland Hospital]</ref>

Lee latterly became based again at [[University College London|UCL]]. He was interested in [[tissue engineering]] and teaching [[ethics]] in reproduction.<ref name="ucl">{{cite web|url= http://www.anat.ucl.ac.uk/staff/personalpages/sammylee.shtml|publisher=[[University College London|UCL]]|author=S. Lee|title=UCL staff webpage|year=2007}}</ref> He was working on tissue engineering and stem cells mainly concerned with background [[research]] on [[Stem cells]] and [[Progenitor cells]]. Dr. Lee also had a keen interest in ethics and expressed this at UCL by running a course titled "Ethics of Fertility and Embryo Research". His students remarked him to be knowledgeable in the field of ethics and enthusiastic; they had particularly noted that he is clearly a fan of Kant.

He had previously served as an [[international]] [[editing|editor]] of the Brazilian Journal of Assisted Reproduction. He served as a Trustee and director of several charities. His [[curriculum vitae]] lists numerous [[scientific publications]]. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Health (now Royal Society for PublicHealth) and the [[Royal Society of Medicine]], both in 1987.<ref>[[University College London|UCL]] Staff Page (1987) Lee was FRSM and FRSH. He was inducted to Fellowship of RSH (now RSPH) and RSM. [http://www.cdb.ucl.ac.uk/academics/lee/]</ref>

Lee's team at the Wellington pioneered the first UK practise of gamete Intra-fallopian Transfer ([[Gamete intrafallopian transfer|GIFT]]), ''The GIFT of Life'' (a technique invented by [[Ricardo Asch]] in the USA). The team was the second to carry out GIFT and then proceeded to post the largest series in the world in 1986.<ref name="media" /><ref name="media2" />

Lee also helped perform some of the first [[ovum|egg]] [[donations]] in the [[UK]], when directing the [[Wellington Hospital, United Kingdom|Wellington Hospital]] IVF Laboratory.<ref>[http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/1/6/422 Laboratory Director and Chief Scientist at the Wellington Hospital]</ref>

Lee pioneered a simple inexpensive efficient form of Mechanical Assisted Hatching in the [[UK]].<ref name="ah">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990808/ai_n14493048 |title=My little miracle|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|date=1999-08-08|author=A Kon}}</ref> He produced the world's first intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection ([[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] with NASBA [[virus]] [[assay]]) virus free baby to an [[HIV]] [[discordant]] couple.<ref>S. Lee and H Rivas-Toro (2001). "Treatment with IUI and ICSI for HIV men whose partners remain HIV- free: a risk reduction method". J. Bras. Reprod. Ass. 5: 64–65</ref>

Lee had many [[Mass media|media]] appearances having been on many [[TV shows]] as well as writing a number of [[newspapers]] articles . He wrote several books of his own: such as ''Counselling in Male Infertility'', and was also a [[wikt:contributor|contributor]]/[[consultant]] in such books: ''The Miraculous World of The Unborn Baby'' (Quadrillion, Godalming, Surrey 1998) ISBN 1-85833-966-9, ''Natural Fertility'' (Hamlyn 2002) ISBN 0-600-60396-2 and ''Inconceivable Conceptions''.

Lee was no stranger to [[controversy]]. In addition to his work in IVF, he had differences of opinion with the [[HFEA]], most notably over the issue of [[human cloning]].<ref>[[BBC News]] Dr Sammy Lee and Ruth Deech head of the UK human fertilisation authority [http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/1210000/audio/_1210996_cloning_leedeech07.ram</ref> He states that if it may be done safely and effectively, it may be [[morally]] justifiable. 

Lee also wrote an article in the [[Sunday Times]] (10 November 2002) in the aftermath of a number of high profile embryo transfer mixups in several human IVF [[clinics]].

Professor Sammy Lee arranged a conference co-sponsored by the Progress Educational Trust entitled '21st Century Motherhood' at the University College London (UCL) (18 September 2009).
Speakers included [[Peter Brinsden]], Consultant Medical Director at Bourn Hall Clinic, Professor Lord [[Robert Winston]] and Professor [[Shere Hite]]<ref>[[Times]] On Line 'Cultural historian Shere Hite says it’s just sexism ' [http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article6843074.ece]</ref><ref>UCL '21st Century Motherhood' Conference at the University College London (UCL) (18 September 2009) [http://www.cdb.ucl.ac.uk/oldermothers/programme]</ref>
