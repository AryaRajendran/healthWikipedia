The '''Romanian School of Neurology''' influenced a great share of Romanian and foreign 
neurologists, descending from a group of [[Gheorghe Marinescu]]'s co-workers at the Neurological Department of the [[Colentina Hospital]] at the [[Bucharest University]]. One can therefore also speak of '''Marinescu's School of Neurology'''.

Marinescu's closest collaborators were [[Ion Minea]] (with contributions to neuroinfections), [[Anghel Radovici]] (with whom Marinescu described the ''kinn reflex'', author of the monograph ''La Syphilis nerveuse'', 1928), [[Nicolae Ionescu-Siseşti]] (who was his successor as head of the department, author of the monographs ''Tumeurs Médullaires'', 1929, ''Syringobulbie'', 1932), [[State Drăgănescu]] (author of the book ''Lichidul cefalo- rahidian'' (The Cerebrospinal Fluid), 1932 and of the monograph ''Encefalite Virotice Umane'' (Human Viral Encephalitis, 1962, with Arcadie Petrescu), [[Oskar Sager]] (Head of the department after the death oh N. Ionescu-Siseşti in 1954, author of studies on the physiology of the [[thalamus]] with [[J.G. Dusser de Barenne]]), [[Arthur Kreindler]] (co-author of the Marinescu's monograph ''Les Reflexes Conditionnelles'', 1935, author of the monographs ''Epilepsia'' (Epilepsy), 1955, ''La Physiologie et Physiopathologie du cervelet'', 1958, with Mircea Steriade, ''Anatomo-fiziologia clinică a sistemului nervos central'' (Clinical Anatomo-physiology of the Central Nervous System), 1957, with Vlad Voiculescu), ''Afazia'' (Aphasia), 1962, with [[Alexandru Fradis]]), [[Emmerich Façon]] (contributions to clinical neurology and neuroinfections).

Starting from 1954, Arthur Kreindler, in his double position as director of the Institute of Neurology of the [[Romanian Academy]] and head of the post-graduate chair of Neurology at the Bucharest University, surrounded himself with personalities like [[State Drăgănescu]], [[Theodor Horneţ]] and [[Vlad Voiculescu]]. The chair organized post-graduate specialization in [[neurology]], training many neurologists all over the country.

The central themes of clinical research were [[epilepsy]], [[cerebro-vascular diseases]], [[viral encephalitis]], [[aphasia]]. Basic research dealt especially with states of consciousness, physiology of the thalamus, [[conditioned reflexes]] a.s.o. From the initial anatomo-clinical orientation, Romanian neurology evolved to a neurophysiological one, involving such modern topics as [[neurochemistry]], [[neurogenetics]] and [[neuropsychology]].

The following neurologists from the next generation should be quoted: [[Mihai Ioan Botez]], [[Victor Ionăşescu]], [[Ion N. Petrovici]], [[Jean-Jaques Askenasy]] and [[Mircea Steriade]].

Presently the main representative of Marinescu's school of neurology in Romania is [[Constantin Popa, neurologist|Constantin Popa]], head of the neurological department at the [[Carol Davilla University]] and director of the institute for cerebrovascular diseases in Bucharest.
