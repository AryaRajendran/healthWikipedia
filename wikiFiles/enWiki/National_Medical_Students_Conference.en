The National Medical Students’ Conference is an annual gathering of medical students in the Philippines. Organized by the Asian Medical Students’ Association (AMSA)-Philippines, NMSC provides medical students a venue to interact with and learn from each other outside the confines of the classroom, laboratory and hospital. It is under the jurisdiction of the Internal Vice President of AMSA Philippines.

The two-day event includes five core parts: Conference Proper, AMSA Philippines Research Competition, AMSA Philippines Organizational Meetings, Socials Night and NMSC Workshops. NMSC combines key characteristics of both the Asian Medical Students’ Conference (AMSC) of AMSA International and the General Assemblies of the International Federation of Medical Students’ Associations (IFMSA).

== Conference Proper ==
Distinguished leaders and pioneers in Philippine medicine discuss about the current issues in their respective fields through keynote addresses, plenary lectures and panel discussions. Small group discussions also facilitate further learning and interaction among participants.

== AMSA Philippines Research Competition ==
The AMSA Philippines Research Competition began in NMSC 2011. It is open to medical students in all bona fide Philippine medical schools. An initial pre-NMSC screening process categorizes the entries as qualified for oral competition, qualified for poster competition or unqualified. The judges for the initial screening usually hail from editors of established Philippine medical journals such as Acta Medica Philippina. The winning entries on both oral and poster competitions represent AMSA Philippines in the succeeding AMSC, and qualified entries may be published in partner journals including the International Journal of Students’ Research.

== AMSA Philippines Organizational Meetings ==
NMSC also acts as the venue for various presentations of the national officers regarding the accomplishments of their standing committees for the past year and the new and upcoming partnerships and opportunities ahead. Furthermore, the Executive Board congregates to elect on the membership status of Candidate Member Organizations. Lastly the National Elections are constitutionally held during NMSC, where presidents and/or liaison officers of the Local Member Organizations act as primary voters.

== Socials Night ==
As is norm in every AMSA International and IFMSA event, the Socials Night provides venues for members from all over the country to interact amongst each other and participate in various social activities, furthering the strength and goals of the organization. A pre-conference socials night may also be held.

== NMSC Workshops ==
Each delegate is tasked to select from a list of available workshops tailored to supplement the conference theme. Most of the workshops are highly skills-based and are not taught within the confines of the classroom and hospital. The workshops themselves engage the participants to greater learning opportunities.

=== Conference Theme: Making the Five-Star Filipino Physician ===
The conference tackled the opportunities and obstacles on how Filipino future physicians can become holistic and relevant doctors for the Filipinos – as clinicians, teachers, researchers, managers, and social mobilizers. Participants engaged in healthy and dynamic discussions about the field of medicine in the Philippines as well as meet successful and inspiring models from different sectors of the Philippine health system.
The opening keynote address Making the Five-Star Filipino Physician was delivered by the then Philippine Health Secretary Enrique Ona, MD.
