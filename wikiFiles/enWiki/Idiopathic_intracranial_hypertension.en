'''Idiopathic intracranial hypertension''' (IIH), sometimes called by the older names '''benign intracranial hypertension''' (BIH) or '''pseudotumor cerebri''' (PTC), is a [[neurological disorder]] that is characterized by increased [[intracranial pressure]] (pressure around the brain) in the absence of a [[brain tumor|tumor]] or other diseases. The main symptoms are [[headache]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]], as well as pulsatile [[tinnitus]] (buzzing in the ears synchronous with the pulse), [[diplopia|double vision]] and other visual symptoms. If untreated, it may lead to [[papilledema|swelling]] of the [[optic disc]] in the eye, which can progress to [[vision loss]].<ref name=Binder>{{cite journal |author=Binder DK, Horton JC, Lawton MT, McDermott MW |title=Idiopathic intracranial hypertension |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=538–51; discussion 551–2 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15028127 |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000109042.87246.3C}}</ref>

IIH is diagnosed with a [[neuroimaging|brain scan]] (to rule out other causes) and a [[lumbar puncture]]; lumbar puncture may also provide temporary and sometimes permanent relief from the symptoms. Some respond to [[medication]] (with the drug [[acetazolamide]]), but others require surgery to relieve the pressure. The condition may occur in all age groups, but is most common in young women, especially those with [[obesity]].<ref name=Binder/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common symptom of IIH is headache, which occurs in almost all (92–94%) cases. It is characteristically worse in the morning, generalized in character and throbbing in nature. It may be associated with nausea and vomiting. The headache can be made worse by [[Valsalva maneuver|any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure]], such as [[cough]]ing and [[sneeze|sneezing]]. The pain may also be experienced in the neck and shoulders.<ref name=Binder/> Many have [[Tinnitus|pulsatile tinnitus]], a whooshing sensation in one or both ears (64–87%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse.<ref name=Binder/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sismanis A |title=Pulsatile tinnitus.

The increased pressure leads to compression and traction of the [[cranial nerve]]s, a group of nerves that arise from the [[brain stem]] and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the [[abducens nerve]] (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with [[sixth nerve palsy]] therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the [[oculomotor nerve]] and [[trochlear nerve]] ([[Oculomotor nerve palsy|third]] and [[fourth nerve palsy]], respectively) are affected; both play a role in eye movements.<ref name=Soler/><ref name=FriedmanJacobson2002>{{cite journal | author = Friedman DI, Jacobson DM | year=2002 | title = Diagnostic criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension | journal = Neurology | volume = 59 | issue = 10 | pages = 1492–1495 | pmid = 12455560}}</ref> The [[facial nerve]] (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial [[Facial nerve paralysis|weakness of the muscles of facial expression]] on one or both sides of the face.<ref name=Binder/>

The increased pressure leads to [[papilledema]], which is swelling of the [[optic disc]], the spot where the [[optic nerve]] enters the [[Human eye|eye]]ball. This occurs in practically all cases of IIH, but not everyone experiences symptoms from this. Those who do experience symptoms typically report "transient visual obscurations", episodes of difficulty seeing that occur in both eyes but not necessarily at the same time. Long-term untreated papilledema leads to visual loss, initially in the periphery but progressively towards the center of vision.<ref name=Binder/><ref name=Acheson/>

[[Neurological examination|Physical examination of the nervous system]] is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on examination of the eye with a small device called an [[ophthalmoscope]] or in more detail with a [[fundus camera]]. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on [[eye examination]] in the form of a [[strabismus|squint]] (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, [[visual field]]s may be constricted and [[visual acuity]] may be decreased. [[Visual field test]]ing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to [[optic atrophy]], in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.<ref name=Binder/><ref name=Acheson>{{cite journal |author=Acheson JF |title=Idiopathic intracranial hypertension and visual function |journal=British Medical Bulletin |volume=79-80 |issue= 1|pages=233–44 |year=2006 |pmid=17242038 |doi=10.1093/bmb/ldl019 |url=http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/79-80/1/233}}</ref>

==Causes==
"Idiopathic" means "of unknown etiology". Therefore, IIH can only be diagnosed if there is no alternative explanation for the symptoms. [[Intracranial pressure]] may be increased due to medications such as high-dose [[vitamin A]] derivatives (e.g. [[isotretinoin]] for [[acne vulgaris|acne]]), long-term [[tetracycline antibiotics]] (for a variety of skin conditions) and [[hormonal contraceptives]]. There are numerous other diseases, mostly rare conditions, that may lead to intracranial hypertension. If there is an underlying cause, the condition is termed "secondary intracranial hypertension".<ref name=Binder/> Common causes of secondary intracranial hypertension include [[obstructive sleep apnea]] (a sleep-related breathing disorder), [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE), [[chronic kidney disease]], and [[Behçet's disease]].<ref name=Acheson/>

==Mechanism==
The cause of IIH is not known. The [[Monro-Kellie rule]] states that the intracranial pressure (literally: pressure inside the skull) is determined by the amount of brain tissue, [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) and blood inside the bony cranial vault. Three theories therefore exist as to why the pressure might be raised in IIH: an excess of CSF production, increased volume of blood or brain tissue, or obstruction of the [[Cerebral veins|veins that drain blood from the brain]].<ref name=Binder/>

The first theory, that of increased production of cerebrospinal fluid, was proposed in early descriptions of the disease. However, there is no experimental data that supports a role for this process in IIH.<ref name=Binder/>

The second theory posits that either increased blood flow to the brain or increase in the brain tissue itself may result in the raised pressure. Little evidence has accumulated to support the suggestion that increased blood flow plays a role, but both [[biopsy]] samples and various types of brain scans have shown an increased water content of the brain tissue. It remains unclear why this might be the case.<ref name=Binder/>

The third theory suggests that blood flow from the brain may be impaired or congested. Only in a small proportion of patients has underlying narrowing of the cerebral sinuses or veins been demonstrated. Congestion of venous blood may result from a generally increased venous pressure, which has been linked to obesity.<ref name=Binder/><ref name=Acheson/>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of the history and examination. To confirm the diagnosis, as well as excluding alternative causes, several investigations are required; more investigations may be performed if the history is not typical or the patient is more likely to have an alternative problem: children, men, the elderly, or women who are not overweight.<ref name=FriedmanJacobson2002/>

===Investigations===
[[Neuroimaging]], usually with [[computed tomography]] (CT/CAT) or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), is used to detect any mass lesions. In IIH these scans may be normal, although small or slit-like [[ventricular system|ventricles]] and "[[Empty sella syndrome|empty sella sign]]" (flattening of the [[pituitary gland]] due to increased pressure) may be seen. An MR venogram is also performed in most cases (or according to some experts, only in atypical cases<ref name=FriedmanJacobson2002/>) to exclude the possibility of venous obstruction or [[cerebral venous sinus thrombosis]].<ref name=Binder/><ref name=Soler/><ref name=FriedmanJacobson2002/> Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.<ref>Peter P, Philip N, Singh Y. Reversal of MRI findings following CSF drainage in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Neurol India 2012;60:267-8.</ref>

[[Lumbar puncture]] is performed to measure the opening pressure, as well as to obtain [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) to exclude alternative diagnoses. If the opening pressure is increased, CSF may be removed for relief (see below).<ref name=FriedmanJacobson2002/> The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the [[glucose]] level, and [[protein]] levels. In idiopathic intracranial hypertension, by definition all of these are within their normal limits.<ref name=FriedmanJacobson2002/> Occasionally, the pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may be attributable to the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate over the course of the normal day. If the suspicion of problems remains high, it may be necessary to perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.<ref name=FriedmanJacobson2002/>

===Classification===
The original criteria for IIH were described by [[Walter Dandy|Dandy]] in 1937.<ref name=Dandy1937>{{cite journal |author=Dandy WE|year=1937 |month=October |title=Intracranial pressure without brain tumor - diagnosis and treatment |journal= Annals of Surgery |volume=106 |issue= 4|pages=492–513 |pmc=1390605 | doi = 10.1097/00000658-193710000-00002|pmid=17857053}}</ref>

They were modified by Smith in 1985 to become the "modified Dandy criteria". Smith included the use of more advanced imaging: Dandy had required [[Cerebral ventriculography|ventriculography]], but Smith replaced this with [[computed tomography]].<ref name=JLSmith>{{cite journal |author=Smith JL |title=Whence pseudotumor cerebri? |journal=Journal of Clinical Neuroophthalmology |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=55–6 |year=1985 |pmid=3156890}}</ref> In a 2001 paper, Digre and Corbett amended Dandy's criteria further. They added the requirement that the patient is awake and alert, as coma precludes adequate neurological assessment, and require exclusion of venous sinus thrombosis as an underlying cause. Furthermore, they add the requirement that no other cause for the raised ICP is found.<ref name=Binder/><ref name=Acheson/><ref name=DigreCorbett>{{cite journal | author=Digre KB, Corbett JJ | title=Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): A reappraisal | journal=Neurologist | year=2001 | volume=7 | pages=2–67 | doi=10.1097/00127893-200107010-00002}}</ref>

In a 2002 review, Friedman and Jacobson propose an alternative set of criteria, derived from Smith's. These require the absence of symptoms that could not be explained by a diagnosis of IIH, but do not require the actual presence of any symptoms (such as headache) attributable to IIH. These criteria also require that the lumbar puncture is performed with patient lying sideways, as a lumbar puncture performed in the upright sitting position can lead to artificially high pressure measurements. Friedman and Jacobson also do not insist on MR venography for every patient; rather, this is only required in atypical cases (see "diagnosis" above).<ref name=FriedmanJacobson2002/>

==Treatment==
The primary goal in treatment of IIH is the prevention of visual loss and blindness, as well as symptom control.<ref name=Acheson/> IIH is treated mainly through the reduction of CSF pressure and, where applicable, weight loss. IIH may resolve after initial treatment, may go into spontaneous remission (although it can still relapse at a later stage), or may continue chronically.<ref name=Binder/><ref name=FriedmanJacobson2002/>

===Lumbar puncture===

A large area on the back has been washed with an [[iodine]]-based disinfectant leaving brown colouration. In this image the patient is seated upright, which can make the procedure easier to perform but makes any measurement of the opening pressure unreliable.]]
The first step in symptom control is drainage of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture. If necessary, this may be performed at the same time as a diagnostic LP (such as done in search of a CSF infection). In some cases, this is sufficient to control the symptoms, and no further treatment is needed.<ref name=Soler/><ref name=Acheson/>

The procedure can be repeated if necessary, but this is generally taken as a clue that additional treatments may be required to control the symptoms and preserve vision. Repeated lumbar punctures are regarded as unpleasant by patients, and they present a danger of introducing spinal infections if done too often.<ref name=Binder/><ref name=Soler/> Repeated lumbar punctures are sometimes needed to control the ICP urgently if the patient's vision deteriorates rapidly.<ref name=Acheson/>

===Medication===
The best-studied medical treatment for intracranial hypertension is [[acetazolamide]] (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme [[carbonic anhydrase]], and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It can cause the symptoms of [[hypokalemia]] (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since it has shown to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings it has been shown to cause [[metabolic acidosis]] as well as [[water-electrolyte imbalance|disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels]] newborn babies. The diuretic [[furosemide]] is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.<ref name=Binder/><ref name=Acheson/>

Various [[analgesic]]s (painkillers) may be used in controlling the headaches of intracranial hypertension. In addition to conventional agents such as [[paracetamol]], a low dose of the antidepressant [[amitriptyline]] or the anticonvulsant [[topiramate]] have shown some additional benefit for pain relief.<ref name=Acheson/>

The use of [[glucocorticoid|steroids]] in the attempt to reduce the ICP is controversial. These may be used in severe papilledema, but otherwise their use is discouraged.<ref name=Binder/>

===Surgery===
Two main surgical procedures exist in the treatment of IIH: ''optic nerve sheath decompression and fenestration'' and [[cerebral shunt|shunting]]. Surgery would normally only be offered if medical therapy is either unsuccessful or not tolerated.<ref name=Soler/><ref name=Acheson/> The choice between these two procedures depends on the predominant problem in IIH. Neither procedure is perfect: both may cause significant complications, and both may eventually fail in controlling the symptoms. There are no [[randomized controlled trial]]s to guide the decision as to which procedure is best.<ref name=Acheson/>

Optic nerve sheath fenestration is an [[ophthalmology|ophthalmological]] operation that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the [[optic nerve]] in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, but it may be the result of either diversion of the CSF into the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure.<ref name=Acheson/> The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%.<ref name=Binder/> The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.<ref name=Acheson/>

Shunt surgery, usually performed by [[neurosurgery|neurosurgeons]], involves the creation of a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a [[Lumbar-peritoneal shunt|lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt]], which connects the subarachnoid space in the [[lumbar spine]] with the [[peritoneal cavity]]. Generally, a pressure valve is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief in about half the cases; others require revision of the shunt, often on more than one occasion—usually due to shunt obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions, a ''ventriculoatrial'' or ''ventriculoperitoneal shunt'' may be considered. These shunts are inserted in one of the [[lateral ventricles]] of the brain, usually by [[stereotactic surgery]], and then connected either to the [[right atrium]] of the heart or the peritoneal cavity, respectively.<ref name=Binder/><ref name=Acheson/> Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts, it is possible that this procedure will become the first-line type of shunt treatment.<ref name=Binder/>

It has been shown that in obese people, [[bariatric surgery]] (and especially [[gastric bypass surgery]]) can lead to resolution of the condition in over 95%.<ref name=Binder/>

==Prognosis==
It is not known what percentage of people with IIH will remit spontaneously, and what percentage will develop chronic disease.<ref name=Acheson/>

IIH does not normally affect life expectancy. The major complications from IIH arise from untreated or treatment-resistant [[papilledema]]. In various case series, the long-term risk of ones vision being significantly affected by IIH is reported to lie anywhere between 10 and 25%.<ref name=Binder/><ref name=Acheson/>

==Epidemiology==
[[Image:IIH incidence.png|right|thumb|The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of IIH is strongly determined by sex and [[body weight]]. The figures in females are in women between 20 and 45 years old.<ref name=Binder/>]]

On average, IIH occurs in about one per 100,000 people, and can occur in children and adults. The [[median]] age at diagnosis is 30. IIH occurs predominantly in women, especially in the ages 20 to 45, who are four to eight times more likely than men to be affected. [[Overweight]] and [[obesity]] strongly predispose a person to IIH: women who are more than ten percent over their [[ideal body weight]] are thirteen times more likely to develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over their ideal body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.<ref name=Binder/>

Despite several reports of IIH in families, there is no known genetic cause for IIH. People from all [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] may develop IIH.<ref name=Binder/> In children, there is no difference in incidence between males and females.<ref name=Soler/>

From national hospital admission databases it appears that the need for [[neurosurgical]] intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity,<ref name=Curry_et_al_2005>{{cite journal |author=Curry WT, Butler WE, Barker FG |title=Rapidly rising incidence of cerebrospinal fluid shunting procedures for idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the United States, 1988-2002 |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=97–108; discussion 97–108 |year=2005 |pmid=15987545| doi = 10.1227/01.NEU.0000163094.23923.E5}}</ref> although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of [[cerebral shunt|shunting]] over optic nerve sheath fenestration.<ref name=Acheson/>

==History==
The first report of IIH was by the German physician [[Heinrich Quincke]], who described it in 1893 under the name '''serous meningitis'''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Quincke HI|title=Meningitis serosa|journal=Sammlung Klinischer Vorträge |year=1893|volume=67|pages=655}}</ref> The term "pseudotumor cerebri" was introduced in 1904 by his compatriot [[Max Nonne]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nonne M|title=Ueber Falle vom Symptomkomplex "Tumor Cerebri" mit Ausgang in Heilung (Pseudotumor Cerebri)|language=German|journal= Deutsche Zeitschrift für Nervenheilkunde |volume=27|issue=3-4 |pages=169–216 |year=1904 |doi=10.1007/BF01667111}}</ref> Numerous other cases appeared in the literature subsequently; in many cases, the raised intracranial pressure may actually have resulted from underlying conditions.<ref name=Johnston>{{cite journal |author=Johnston I |title=The historical development of the pseudotumor concept |journal=Neurosurgical Focus |volume=11 |issue=2 | pages = 1 |year=2001 |pmid=16602675 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/405734_1 | doi = 10.3171/foc.2001.11.2.3}}</ref> For instance, the '''otitic hydrocephalus''' reported by London neurologist Sir [[Charles Symonds]] may have resulted from venous sinus thrombosis caused by [[otitis media|middle ear infection]].<ref name=Johnston/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Symonds CP | title=Otitic hydrocephalus | journal=Brain | year=1931 | volume=54 | issue=3705 | pmid=20776602 | pages=55–71 | pmc=2519971 | url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/54/1/55 | doi=10.1093/brain/54.1.55}}</ref> Diagnostic criteria for IIH were developed in 1937 by the [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] neurosurgeon [[Walter Dandy]]; Dandy also introduced subtemporal decompressive surgery in the treatment of the condition.<ref name=Dandy1937/><ref name=Johnston/>

The terms "benign" and "pseudotumor" derive from the fact that increased intracranial pressure may be associated with [[brain tumor]]s. Those patients in whom no tumour was found were therefore diagnosed with "pseudotumor cerebri" (a disease mimicking a brain tumor). The disease was renamed "benign intracranial hypertension" in 1955 to distinguish it from intracranial hypertension due to life-threatening diseases (such as cancer);<ref>{{cite journal |author=Foley J |title=Benign forms of intracranial hypertension; toxic and otitic hydrocephalus |journal=Brain |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=1–41 |year=1955 |pmid=14378448 |doi=10.1093/brain/78.1.1}}</ref> however, this was also felt to be misleading because any disease that can blind someone should not be thought of as benign, and the name was therefore revised in 1989 to "idiopathic (of no identifiable cause) intracranial hypertension".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Corbett JJ, Thompson HS |title=The rational management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension |journal=Archives of Neurology |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=1049–51 |year=1989 |month=October |pmid=2679506}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bandyopadhyay S |title=Pseudotumor cerebri |journal=Archives of Neurology |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=1699–701 |year=2001 |pmid=11594936| doi = 10.1001/archneur.58.10.1699}}</ref>

Shunt surgery was introduced in 1949; initially, ventriculoperitoneal shunts were used. In 1971, good results were reported with lumboperitoneal shunting. Negative reports on shunting in the 1980s led to a brief period (1988–1993) during which optic nerve fenestration (which had initially been described in an unrelated condition in 1871) was more popular. Since then, shunting is recommended predominantly, with occasional exceptions.<ref name=Binder/><ref name=Acheson/>
