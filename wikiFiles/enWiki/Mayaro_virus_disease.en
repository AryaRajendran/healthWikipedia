'''Mayaro virus disease''' is a [[mosquito]]borne [[zoonotic]] [[pathogen]] [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to certain humid [[forests]] of [[tropical]] [[South America]].  Infection with Mayaro virus causes an acute, self-limited [[dengue]]-like illness of 3–5 days' duration.<ref name="Receveur">Receveur MC, Grandadam M, Pistone T, Malvy D. ''Infection with Mayaro virus in a French traveller returning from the Amazon region, Brazil, January, 2010''. Euro Surveill. 2010;15(18):pii=19563. Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19563.</ref>  The causative virus, abbreviated MAYV, is in the family [[Togaviridae]], and [[genus]] [[Alphavirus]].  It is closely related to other [[alphavirus]]es that produce a dengue-like illness accompanied by long-lasting [[arthralgia]].  It is only known to circulate in tropical [[South America]].<ref name="Receveur"/>

==Virology==
Mayaro Virus has a structure similar to other Alphavirus. MAYV is an enveloped virus and has an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 70&nbsp;nm. The virus genome is composed of a linear, positive sense, single-stranded RNA with 11,429 nucleotides, excluding the 5’ cap nucleotide and 3’ poly(A) tail.<ref name="Lavergne">Lavergne A, de Thoisy B, Lacoste V, Pascalis H, Pouliquen JF, Mercier V, Tolou H, Dussart P, Morvan J, Talarmin A, Kazanji M. “Mayaro virus: complete nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic relationships with other alphaviruses”. {{cite journal| title=Virus Res. 2006 May;117(2):283-90|pmid=16343676}}</ref><ref name="Mourão2012">Mourão MP, Bastos Mde S, de Figueiredo RP, Gimaque JB, Galusso Edos S, Kramer VM, de Oliveira CM, Naveca FG, Figueiredo LT. “Mayaro fever in the city of Manaus, Brazil, 2007-2008”. {{cite journal| title=Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2012 Jan;12(1):42-6|pmid=21923266}}</ref> 

The MAYV RNA genome contains the 5’ untranslated region (UTR), 3’ non-coding region (NCR) and two open reading frames (ORFs). The 5’ proximal and 3’ proximal ORFs are separated by a short non-coding sequence and represent two-third and one-third of the genomic RNA, respectively. The 5’-proximal ORF codes for a polyprotein that after cleavage forms non-structural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, nsP4) and the 3’-proximal ORF with a 26S promoter codes for a polyprotein that is cleaved into structural proteins to generate capsid proteins and envelope surface glycoproteins (E1, E2, E3, C, 6K).<ref name="Lavergne"/><ref name="Snyder">Snyder AJ, Mukhopadhyay S. “The alphavirus E3 glycoprotein functions in a clade-specific manner”. {{cite journal| title=J Virol. 2012 Dec;86(24):13609-20|pmid=23035234}}</ref><ref name="Firth">Firth AE, Chung BY, Fleeton MN, Atkins JF. “Discovery of frameshifting in Alphavirus 6K resolves a 20-year enigma”. {{cite journal| title=Virol J. 2008 Sep 26;5:108|pmid=18822126}}</ref><ref name="Muñoz">Muñoz M., Navarro J.C. “Virus Mayaro: un arbovirus reemergente en Venezuela y Latinoamérica”.

The non-structural proteins (nsP) play different functions in the virus cycle. The non-structural protein 1 (nsP1) is an mRNA-capping enzyme, nsP2 has protease activity, nsP4 is a RNA-direct RNA polymerase. The structural polyprotein is cleaved into 6 chains: Capsid protein (C), p62, E3 protein or spike glycoprotein E3, E2 envelope glycoprotein or spike glycoprotein E2, 6K protein, E1 envelope glycoprotein known also as spike glycoprotein E1.<ref name="UniProtKB">Netto M.C.M.G., Shirako Y., Strauss E.G., Carvalho M.G.C., Strauss J.H.

The MAYV sequences analysis showed two genotypes (D and L). The amplicon used for phylogenetic analysis includes E1 and E2 glycoprotein genes and the 3’ NCR. The genotype D is distributed in Trinidad, Brasil, French Guiana, Surinam, Peru and Bolivia while the genotype L is limited to the northcentral region of Brasil<ref name="Powers">Powers A, Aguilar P, Chandler L, Brault A, Meakins T, Watts D, et al.

==Diagnosis==
The MAYV infection is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, rash, prominent pain in the large joints, and association with rheumatic disease,<ref name="Figueiredo">Figueiredo LT. “Emergent arboviruses in Brazil”. {{cite journal| title= Rev Soc Bras Med Trop. 2007 Mar-Apr;40(2):224-9|pmid=17568894}}</ref><ref name="Suhrbier">Suhrbier A, Jaffar-Bandjee MC, Gasque P. “Arthritogenic alphaviruses an overview”. {{cite journal| title=Nat Rev Rheumatol. 2012 May 8;8(7):420-9|pmid=22565316}}</ref> but these signs and symptoms are unspecific to distinguish from other Arbovirus. The MAYV infection can be confirmed by laboratory testing such us virus isolation, RT-PCR and serology. The virus isolation in cell culture is effective during viremia. RT-PCR helps to identify virus. Serology tests detect antibodies like IgM and the most common assay is IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA). This test usually requires a consecutive retest to confirm increasing titers.<ref name="Forshey">Forshey BM, Guevara C, Laguna-Torres VA, Cespedes M, Vargas J, Gianella A, Vallejo E, Madrid C, Aguayo N, Gotuzzo E, Suarez V, Morales AM, Beingolea L, Reyes N, Perez J, Negrete M, Rocha C, Morrison AC, Russell KL, Blair PJ, Olson JG, Kochel TJ; NMRCD Febrile Surveillance Working Group. “Arboviral etiologies of acute febrile illnesses in Western South America, 2000-2007”. {{cite journal| title=PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2010 Aug 10;4(8):e787|pmid=20706628}}</ref><ref name="Wang">Wang E, Paessler S, Aguilar P, Carrara A, Ni H, Greene I, et al.

==Epidemiology==
The virus’s transmission cycle in the wild is similar to the continuous [[sylvatic]] cycle of [[yellow fever]] and is believed to involve wild [[primates]] ([[monkeys]]) as the [[reservoir]] and the tree-canopy-dwelling ''[[Haemagogus]]'' species [[mosquito]] as the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].<ref name="Receveur"/>  Human infections are strongly associated with exposure to humid tropical forest environments. [[Chikungunya]] virus is closely related, producing a nearly indistinguishable, highly debilitating arthralgic disease. On February 19, 2011, a Portuguese-language news source reported on a recent survey which revealed Mayaro virus activity in [[Manaus]], [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] State, [[Brazil]].<ref>Redação NotíciasNX: "Manaus tem surto de vírus semelhante ao da dengue", http://www.noticiasnx.com.br/2010/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=25048:-manaus-tem-surto-de-virus-semelhante-ao-da-dengue-&catid=47:ultimas-noticias, Sábado, 19 de Fevereiro de 2011 09:39.</ref>  The survey studied blood samples from 600 residents of Manaus who had experienced a high fever; Mayaro virus was identified in 33 cases.  Four of the cases experienced mild hemorrhagic (bleeding) symptoms, which had not previously been described in Mayaro virus disease.  The report stated that this outbreak is the first detected in a metropolitan setting, and expressed concern that the disease might be adapting to urban species of mosquito vectors, which would make it a risk for spreading within the country.  A study published in October 2011 demonstrated that ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' can  transmit MAYV, supporting the possibility of wider transmission of Mayaro virus disease in an urban setting.<ref>Long, Kanya C., Sarah A. Ziegler, Saravanan Thangamani, Nicole L. Hausser, Tadeusz J. Kochel, Stephen Higgs and Robert B. Tesh. 2011. Experimental Transmission of Mayaro Virus by Aedes aegypti.

The first outbreak of Mayaro virus disease in humans in [[Venezuela]] was reported in early June 2010, with 69 cases diagnosed in [[Ospino]], [[Portuguesa]] state, and an additional two in [[San Fernando de Apure]], [[Apure]] state, on 7 June 2010, for a total of 71 reported cases as of 8 June.<ref>Giuliana Chiappe: “Detectan dos casos más de fiebre mayaro en Apure”, http://www.eluniversal.com/2010/06/06/pol_art_detectan-dos-casos-m_1928906.shtml, 00:19 GMT, 7 June 2010.</ref>  A virologist noted that the symptoms induced by Mayaro virus in the [[New World]] are atypical in the New World, supporting the theory that Mayaro virus is an [[Old World]] virus that was introduced to the New World, possibly via the [[slave trade]].<ref>Professor E A Gould: “ProMED: Mayaro Virus Disease – Venezuela (02): Comment”, http://www.promedmail.org/pls/apex/f?p=2400:1001:2651078590147519::NO::F2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE,F2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID:1000,83114, June 07, 2010.</ref>

==Treatment==
Recent research has suggested that [[macrophage migration inhibitory factor]] plays a critical role in determining the clinical severity of alphavirus-induced [[musculoskeletal]] disease and may provide a target for development of [[antiviral drug|antiviral]] [[pharmaceuticals]] for Mayaro virus and other arthrogenic [[alphavirus]]es, such as [[Ross River virus]], [[chikungunya]], [[Sindbis virus]], and [[O'nyong'nyong virus]].<ref>Herrero, L.
