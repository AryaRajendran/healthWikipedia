'''Blackwater fever''' is a complication of [[malaria]] in which [[red blood cells]] burst in the bloodstream ([[hemolysis]]), releasing [[hemoglobinemia|hemoglobin directly into the blood vessels]] and  [[hemoglobinuria|into the urine]], frequently leading to [[kidney failure]]. The term was coined by the [[Sierra Leon]]ean physician [[John Farrell Easmon]] in his 1884 pamphlet entitled "Blackwater Fever." Easmon was the first to treat such cases following the publication of his pamphlet.

==Signs and symptoms==
Within a few days of onset there are chills, with [[rigor (medicine)|rigor]], high [[fever]], [[jaundice]], vomiting, rapidly progressive [[anemia]], and dark red or black urine.

==Causes==
The cause of [[hemolysis|hemolytic]] crises in this disease is unknown (mainly due to intravascular haemolysis). There is rapid and massive destruction of [[red blood cells]] with the production of [[hemoglobinemia]] ([[hemoglobin]] in the blood, but outside the red blood cells), [[hemoglobinuria]] (hemoglobin in urine), intense jaundice, [[anuria]] (passing less than 50 milliliters of urine in a day), and finally death in the majority of cases.

The most probable explanation for blackwater fever is an [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] reaction apparently caused by the interaction of the malaria parasite and the use of quinine. Blackwater fever is caused by heavy parasitization of red blood cells with ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''.  There has been at least one case, however, attributed to ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Katongole-Mbidde E, Banura C, Kizito A |title=Blackwater fever caused by ''Plasmodium vivax'' infection in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=296 |issue=6625 |pages=827 |date=1988-03-19 |pmid=3130932 |pmc=2545111 |doi=10.1136/bmj.296.6625.827}}</ref>  

Blackwater fever is a serious complication of malaria, but [[cerebral malaria]] has a higher [[mortality rate]]. Blackwater fever is much less common today than it was before 1950.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bruneel F, Gachot B, Wolff M, ''et al.'' |title=[Blackwater fever] |language=French |journal=Presse médicale (Paris, France : 1983) |volume=31 |issue=28 |pages=1329–34 |year=2002 |pmid=12355996 |doi=}}</ref> It may be that [[quinine]] plays a role in triggering the condition, and this drug is no longer commonly used for malaria [[prophylaxis]]. Quinine remains important for treatment of malaria except when the parasite is resistant to [[chloroquine]], a problem that has been on the rise since 1990.<ref>{{cite pmid|12355996}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The treatment is [[malaria|antimalarial]] chemotherapy, [[intravenous]] fluid and sometimes supportive care such as [[intensive care]] and [[dialysis]].
