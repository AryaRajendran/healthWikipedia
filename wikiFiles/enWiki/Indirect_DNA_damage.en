[[Image:indirect DNA damage.png|thumb|right|500px| Indirect DNA damage: The chromophore absorbs UV-light ( * denotes an excited state), and the energy of the excited state is creating singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) or a hydroxyl radical (•OH), which then damages DNA through oxidation.<ref name="DNAoxidation">[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-1097.1992.tb04207.x singlet oxygen induced DNA damage]</ref>]]

'''Indirect [[DNA]] damage''' occurs when a [[ultraviolet|UV-photon]] is absorbed in the human skin by a [[chromophore]] that does not have the ability to convert the energy into harmless heat very quickly.<ref name="Cantrell"/> Molecules that do not have this ability have a long-lived [[excited state]]. This long [[Fluorescence#Lifetime|lifetime]] leads to a high probability for reactions with other molecules - so-called bimolecular reactions.<ref name="Cantrell"/> [[Melanin]] and DNA have extremely short excited state lifetimes in the range of a few femtoseconds (10<sup>−15</sup>s).<ref name=DNA_IC>{{cite web |url= http://www.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~kohler/dna.html |title=Ultrafast internal conversion of DNA |accessdate=2008-02-13 |work= }}</ref> The excited state lifetime of these substances is 1,000 to 1,000,000 times longer than the lifetime of melanin,<ref name=Cantrell>{{cite journal |author=Cantrell, Ann; McGarvey, David J; |year=2001 |month= |title= 3(Sun Protection in Man) |journal= Comprehensive Series in Photosciences |volume= 495 |issue= |pages=497–519 |id= CAN 137:43484 |url= }}</ref> and therefore they may cause damage to living cells that come in contact with them.<ref name=Damiani2004>{{cite journal |author=Armeni, Tatiana; Damiani, Elisabetta; et al. |title= Lack of in vitro protection by a common sunscreen ingredient on UVA-induced cytotoxicity in keratinocytes. | journal= Toxicology |volume= 203 |pages=165–178 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1016/j.tox.2004.06.008 |pmid=15363592 |issue=1–3 }}</ref><ref name=Knowland1993>{{cite journal |author=Knowland, John; McKenzie, Edward A.; McHugh, Peter J.; Cridland, Nigel A. |title= Sunlight-induced mutagenicity of a common sunscreen ingredient | journal= FEBS Letters |volume= 324 |pages=309–313 |year=1993 |pmid=8405372 |doi= 10.1016/0014-5793(93)80141-G | issue=3}}</ref><ref name=Mosley2007>{{cite journal |author=Mosley, C N; Wang, L; Gilley, S; Wang, S; Yu,H  |year= 2007 |month= |title= Light-Induced Cytotoxicity and Genotoxicity of a Sunscreen Agent, 2-Phenylbenzimidazol in Salmonella typhimurium TA 102 and HaCaT Keratinocytes |journal= International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |volume= 4 |pmid=17617675 |issue= 2 |pages=126–131 |id= |url= |doi=10.3390/ijerph2007040006}}</ref><ref name=Parsons>{{cite journal |author=Xu, C.; Green, Adele; Parisi, Alfio; Parsons, Peter G  |year= 2001 |month= |title= Photosensitization of the Sunscreen Octyl p-Dimethylaminobenzoate b UVA in Human Melanocytes but not in Keratinocytes |journal= Photochemistry and Photobiology |volume= 73 |issue= 6 |pages=600–604 |id= |url=|doi= 10.1562/0031-8655(2001)073<0600:POTSOP>2.0.CO;2 |pmid=11421064 |issn=0031-8655}}</ref>  

The molecule that originally absorbs the UV-photon is called a "chromophore". Bimolecular reactions can occur either between the excited chromophore and DNA or between the excited chromophore and another species, to produce [[free radical]]s and [[Reactive Oxygen Species]]. These reactive chemical species can reach DNA by diffusion and the bimolecular reaction damages the DNA ([[oxidative stress]]). It is important to note that indirect DNA damage does not result in any warning signal or pain in the human body.

The bimolecular reactions that cause the indirect DNA damage are illustrated in the figure: 
  
:<math>\mathrm{(Chromophore)^* + {}^3O_2 \ \xrightarrow{} \ Chromophore + {}^1O_2}</math>
<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is reactive harmful [[singlet oxygen]]:
:<math>\mathrm{{}^1O_2 + intact\ DNA \ \xrightarrow{} \ {}^3O_2 + damaged\ DNA}</math><ref name="DNAoxidation"/>

==Location of the damage==
Unlike [[direct DNA damage]], which occurs in areas directly exposed to UV-B light, free radicals can travel through the body and affect other areas - possibly even inner organs. The traveling nature of the indirect DNA damage can be seen in the fact that the [[malignant melanoma]] can occur in places that are not directly illuminated by the sun&mdash;in contrast to [[basal-cell carcinoma]] and [[squamous cell carcinoma]], which appear only on directly illuminated locations on the body. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
