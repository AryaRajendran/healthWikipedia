Lyme disease can affect multiple body systems and produce a range of symptoms. Not all patients with Lyme disease will have all symptoms, and many of the symptoms are not specific to Lyme disease, but can occur with other diseases as well. The [[incubation period]] from infection to the onset of symptoms is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days), or much longer (months to years).<ref name="Lymedisease">{{EMedicine|article|330178|Lyme disease'''}}</ref>

Symptoms most often occur from May through September, because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases.<ref name="Lymedisease" /> [[Asymptomatic]] infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States.<ref name="pmid12905137">{{cite journal |author=Steere AC, Sikand VK, Schoen RT, Nowakowski J |title=Asymptomatic infection with Borrelia burgdorferi |journal=Clin.

===Early localized infection===
Early localized infection is where the Lyme disease has not yet spread throughout the body.  The only area affected is where the infection has first come into contact with the skin. The classic sign of early local infection with Lyme disease is a circular, outwardly expanding rash called [[erythema chronicum migrans]] (also erythema migrans or EM), which occurs at the site of the tick bite three to thirty days after the tick bite.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1202521|Ophthalmic aspects of Lyme disease overview of Lyme disease}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-07-159991-6">{{cite journal |author=Steere, AC |chapter= Lyme borreliosis| title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine| publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |edition=17th |isbn=0-07-159991-6 |editor=Fauci A, ''et al.'' | year=2008}}</ref> The rash is red, and may be warm, but is generally painless. Classically, the innermost portion remains dark red and becomes [[induration|indurated]] (is thicker and firmer); the outer edge remains red; and the portion in between clears, giving the appearance of a [[Bullseye (target)|bullseye]]. However, partial clearing is uncommon, and the bullseye pattern more often involves central redness.<ref name="pmid11900494">{{cite journal |author=Smith RP, Schoen RT, Rahn DW, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of early Lyme disease in patients with microbiologically confirmed erythema migrans |journal=Ann.

The erythema migrans rash associated with early infection is found in approximately 80% of patients and can have a range of appearances including the classic target bull's-eye lesion and nontarget appearing lesions. The 20% without the erythema migrans and the nontarget lesions can often cause miss-identification of Lyme Disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aucott JN, Crowder LA, Yedlin V, Kortte KB |title=Bull's-Eye and Nontarget Skin Lesions of Lyme Disease: An Internet Survey of Identification of Erythema Migrans |journal=Dermatol Res Pract |volume=2012 |issue= |pages=451727 |year=2012 |pmid=23133445 |pmc=3485866 |doi=10.1155/2012/451727}} (primary source)</ref> 

EM is thought to occur in about 80% of infected patients.<ref name="isbn0-07-159991-6"/> Patients can also experience [[flu-like symptoms]], such as [[headache]], [[muscle soreness]], [[fever]], and [[malaise]].<ref name="pmid14987414">{{cite journal |author=Auwaerter PG, Aucott J, Dumler JS |title=Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease): molecular and cellular pathobiology and prospects for prevention, diagnosis and treatment |journal=Expert Rev Mol Med |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=1–22 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14987414 |doi=10.1017/S1462399404007276}}</ref> Lyme disease can progress to later stages even in patients who do not develop a rash.<ref name="pmid23319969"/><ref name="pmid12543291">{{cite journal |author=Steere AC, Dhar A, Hernandez J, ''et al.'' |title=Systemic symptoms without erythema migrans as the presenting picture of early Lyme disease |journal=Am.

===Early disseminated infection===
Within days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the ''[[Borrelia]]'' bacteria may begin to spread through the bloodstream. EM may develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite.<ref name="pmid18452799">{{cite journal |author=Dandache P, Nadelman RB |title=Erythema migrans |journal=Infect.

[[Radiculoneuritis]] causes shooting pains that may interfere with sleep, as well as abnormal skin sensations. Mild [[encephalitis]] may lead to [[memory loss]], [[sleep disturbances]], or mood changes. In addition, some [[case report]]s have described altered mental status as the only symptom seen in a few cases of early neuroborreliosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chabria SB, Lawrason J |title=Altered mental status, an unusual manifestation of early disseminated Lyme disease: A case report |journal=J Med Case Rep |volume=1 |issue= |pages=62 |year=2007 |pmid=17688693 |pmc=1973078 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-1-62}}</ref>

The disease may also have cardiac manifestations such as [[Atrioventricular block|AV block]].

===Late disseminated infection {{anchor|Bannwarth syndrome}}===
After several months, untreated or inadequately treated patients may go on to develop severe and chronic symptoms that affect many parts of the body, including the brain, nerves, eyes, joints and heart. Many disabling symptoms can occur, including permanent [[paraparesis]] in extreme cases.<ref name="pmid23319969"/> The associated nerve pain radiating out from the spine is termed Bannwarth syndrome.<ref name="pmid19562015">{{cite journal |author=Nau R, Christen HJ, Eiffert H |title=Lyme disease--current state of knowledge |journal=Dtsch Arztebl Int |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=72–81; quiz 82, I |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19562015 |pmc=2695290 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2009.0072}}</ref>

The late disseminated stage is where the infection has fully spread throughout the body. Chronic neurologic symptoms occur in up to 5% of untreated patients.<ref name="pmid14987414"/> A [[polyneuropathy]] that involves shooting pains, numbness, and tingling in the hands or feet may develop. A neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle cognitive problems, such as difficulties with concentration and short-term memory.

Chronic [[encephalomyelitis]], which may be progressive, can involve cognitive impairment, weakness in the legs, awkward gait, facial palsy, bladder problems, [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], and back pain. In rare cases untreated Lyme disease may cause [[frank psychosis]], which has been mis-diagnosed as [[schizophrenia]] or [[bipolar disorder]]. Panic attacks and anxiety can occur; there may also be delusional behavior, including [[somatoform]] delusions, sometimes accompanied by a [[depersonalization]] or derealization syndrome, where the patients begin to feel detached from themselves or from reality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fallon BA, Nields JA |title=Lyme disease: a neuropsychiatric illness |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue=11 |pages=1571–83 |year=1994 |month=November |pmid=7943444 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=151&page=1571}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hess A, Buchmann J, Zettl UK, ''et al.'' |title=Borrelia burgdorferi central nervous system infection presenting as an organic schizophrenialike disorder |journal=Biol.

Pain is often mild or moderate, usually with swelling at the involved joint. [[Baker's cyst]]s may form and rupture. In some cases, joint erosion occurs.

[[Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans]] (ACA) is a chronic skin disorder observed primarily in Europe among the elderly.<ref name="pmid18452805"/> ACA begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet.

Lyme disease is caused by [[spirochetal]] [[bacteria]] from the [[genus]] ''[[Borrelia]]''. Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella and are composed of about 40% of DNA. Because of their double-membrane envelope, ''Borrelia'' are often mistakenly described as [[Gram negative]] despite the considerable differences in their envelope components with Gram-negative bacteria.<ref>{{cite book |author= Samuels DS; Radolf, JD (editors)| year=2010 |title=Borrelia: Molecular Biology, Host Interaction and Pathogenesis | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-58-5 | chapter=Chapter 6, Structure, Function and Biogenesis of the ''Borrelia'' Cell Envelope}}</ref> The ''Borrelia'' [[species]] that are Lyme-related are collectively known as ''Borrelia burgdorferi [[sensu lato]]'', and show a great deal of [[genetic diversity]].<ref name=Wang>{{cite journal |author=Wang G, van Dam AP, Schwartz I, Dankert J |title=Molecular typing of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato: taxonomic, epidemiological, and clinical implications |journal=Clin.

''Borrelia burgdorferi [[sensu lato]]'' is made up of 18 closely related species, but only three clearly cause Lyme disease: ''B. burgdorferi [[sensu stricto]]'' (predominant in [[North America]], but also present in [[Europe]]), ''B. afzelii'', and ''B. garinii'' (both predominant in [[Eurasia]]).<ref name=Stanek2011>{{cite journal | author = Stanek G, Reiter M | year = 2011 | title = The expanding Lyme Borrelia complex - clinical significance of genomic species | url = | journal = Clin Microbiol Infect | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 487–493 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03492.x | pmid = 21414082 }}</ref> Some studies have also proposed ''B. bissettii'' and ''B. valaisiana'' may sometimes infect humans, but these species do not seem to be important causes of disease.<ref name="pmid18454594">{{cite journal |author=Schneider BS, Schriefer ME, Dietrich G, Dolan MC, Morshed MG, Zeidner NS |title=Borrelia bissettii isolates induce pathology in a murine model of disease |journal=Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=623–33 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18454594 |doi=10.1089/vbz.2007.0251}}</ref><ref name="pmid18650352">{{cite journal |author=Rudenko N, Golovchenko M, Mokrácek A, ''et al.'' |title=Detection of Borrelia bissettii in cardiac valve tissue of a patient with endocarditis and aortic valve stenosis in the Czech Republic |journal=J.

===Transmission===
Lyme disease is classified as a [[zoonosis]], as it is transmitted to humans from a [[natural reservoir]] among rodents by [[tick]]s that feed on both sets of [[Host (biology)|hosts]].<ref name=pmid18452798/> Hard-bodied ticks of the genus ''[[Ixodes]]'' are the main [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of Lyme disease (also the vector for ''[[Babesia]]'').<ref name=Sherris /> Most infections are caused by ticks in the [[Nymph (biology)|nymphal stage]], as they are very small and may feed for long periods of time undetected.<ref name=pmid18452798>{{cite journal |author=Tilly K, Rosa PA, Stewart PE |title=Biology of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi |journal=Infect.

Within the tick midgut, the borrelia's outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the borrelia downregulate OspA and upregulate OspC, another surface protein.  After the borrelia migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hovius JW, van Dam AP, Fikrig E |title=Tick-host-pathogen interactions in Lyme borreliosis |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=434–8 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17656156 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2007.07.001}}</ref> Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Steere AC, Coburn J, Glickstein L |title=The emergence of Lyme disease |journal=J.

Tick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1% of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease.  Transmission may occur within 24 hours of the tick bite and as quickly as within 4 hours.<ref name=pmid11450660/>

Ticks that transmit ''B. burgdorferi'' to humans can also carry and transmit several other parasites, such as ''[[Theileria microti]]'' and ''[[Anaplasma phagocytophilum]]'', which cause the diseases [[babesiosis]] and [[human granulocytic anaplasmosis]] (HGA), respectively.<ref name=pmid17041141>{{cite journal |author=Swanson SJ, Neitzel D, Reed KD, Belongia EA |title=Coinfections acquired from ixodes ticks |journal=Clin.

Coinfections complicate Lyme symptoms, especially diagnosis and treatment. It is possible for a tick to carry and transmit one of the coinfections and not ''Borrelia'', making diagnosis difficult and often elusive. The [[Centers for Disease Control]] studied 100 ticks in rural [[New Jersey]], and found 55% of the ticks were infected with at least one of the pathogens.<ref name="pmid9452402">{{cite journal |author=Varde S, Beckley J, Schwartz I |title=Prevalence of tick-borne pathogens in Ixodes scapularis in a rural New Jersey County |journal=Emerging Infect.

==Pathophysiology==
''Borrelia burgdorferi'' can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joint, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system.<ref name="pmid15085185">{{cite journal |author=Steere AC, Coburn J, Glickstein L |title=The emergence of Lyme disease |journal=J.

''B. burgdorferi'' is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected ''Ixodes'' tick. Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite.<ref name="pmid16698304">{{cite journal |author=Fikrig E, Narasimhan S |title=Borrelia burgdorferi--traveling incognito? |journal=Microbes Infect. |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=1390–9 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16698304 |doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2005.12.022}}</ref> This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the [[dermis]]. The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion.<ref name="pmid15085185" /> [[Neutrophils]], however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in the developing EM lesion. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body.<ref name="pmid17404293">{{cite journal |author=Xu Q, Seemanapalli SV, Reif KE, Brown CR, Liang FT |title=Increasing the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection dramatically attenuates Borrelia burgdorferi infectivity |journal=J.

Days to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of disseminated disease. The spread of ''B. burgdorferi'' is aided by the attachment of the host protease [[plasmin]] to the surface of the spirochete.<ref name="pmid9215633">{{cite journal |author=Coleman JL, Gebbia JA, Piesman J, Degen JL, Bugge TH, Benach JL |title=Plasminogen is required for efficient dissemination of B. burgdorferi in ticks and for enhancement of spirochetemia in mice |journal=Cell |volume=89 |issue=7 |pages=1111–9 |year=1997 |month=June |pmid=9215633 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80298-6}}</ref>

In Lyme [[encephalopathy]], diffuse white matter pathology can disrupt [[grey matter]] connections, and could account for deficits in attention, memory, visuospatial ability, complex cognition, and emotional status.

A developing hypothesis is that the chronic secretion of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] [[hormone]]s as a result of ''Borrelia'' infection may reduce the effect of [[neurotransmitter]]s, or other [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] in the brain by cell-mediated proinflammatory pathways, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones, specifically [[glucocorticoids]] and [[catecholamines]], the major stress hormones.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Elenkov IJ, Iezzoni DG, Daly A, Harris AG, Chrousos GP |title=Cytokine dysregulation, inflammation and well-being |journal=Neuroimmunomodulation |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=255–69 |year=2005 |pmid=16166805 |doi=10.1159/000087104}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Calcagni E, Elenkov I |title=Stress system activity, innate and T helper cytokines, and susceptibility to immune-related diseases |journal=Ann.

This process is mediated via the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]].

It is therefore possible that if some chronic symptoms come from an autoimmune reaction, this could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body.

==Diagnosis==
Lyme disease is [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosed]] clinically based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as [[Erythema chronicum migrans|erythema migrans]], [[facial palsy]] or [[arthritis]]) or a history of possible exposure to infected ticks, as well as [[serology|serological blood tests]]. The EM rash is not always a bullseye, i.e., it can be red all the way across. When making a diagnosis of Lyme disease, health care providers should consider other diseases that may cause similar illness. Not all patients infected with Lyme disease will develop the characteristic bullseye rash, and many may not recall a tick bite.<ref name="Wormser">{{cite journal | author=Wormser G | title=Prospective clinical evaluation of patients from missouri and New York with ''erythema migrans''-like skin lesions | journal=Clin Infect Dis | volume=41 | issue=7 | pages=958–965 | year=2005 | pmid= 16142659 | doi=10.1086/432935 | author-separator=, | author2=Masters E | author3=Nowakowski J | display-authors=3 | last4=McKenna | first4=D. | last5=Holmgren | first5=D. | last6=Ma | first6=K. | last7=Ihde | first7=L. | last8=Cavaliere | first8=L.

Because of the difficulty in [[Microbiological culture|culturing]] ''Borrelia'' bacteria in the laboratory, diagnosis of Lyme disease is typically based on the clinical exam findings and a history of exposure to [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] Lyme areas.<ref name="Sherris" /> The EM rash, which does not occur in all cases, is considered sufficient to establish a diagnosis of Lyme disease even when serologic blood tests are negative.<ref name="Brown">{{cite journal |author=Brown SL, Hansen SL, Langone JJ |title=Role of serology in the diagnosis of Lyme disease |journal=JAMA |volume=282 |issue=1 |pages=62–6 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10404913 |doi=10.1001/jama.282.1.62}}</ref><ref name="Hofmann">{{cite journal |author=Hofmann H |title=Lyme borreliosis--problems of serological diagnosis |journal=Infection |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=470–2 |year=1996 |pmid=9007597 |doi=10.1007/BF01713052}}</ref> Serological testing can be used to support a clinically suspected case, but is not diagnostic by itself.<ref name=Sherris />

===Laboratory testing===
Several forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. The most widely used tests are [[serology|serologies]], which measure levels of specific antibodies in a patient's blood. These tests may be negative in early infection, as the body may not have produced a significant quantity of antibodies, but they are considered a reliable aid in the diagnosis of later stages of Lyme disease.<ref name="cdc-diagnosis">{{cite web | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) | url = http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/lyme/ld_humandisease_diagnosis.htm | title = Lyme Disease Diagnosis | date = October 7, 2008 | accessdate = July 6, 2009}}</ref> Serologic tests for Lyme disease are of limited use in people lacking objective signs of Lyme disease because of false positive results and cost.<ref name="idsa guideline"/>

The serological laboratory tests most widely available and employed are the [[Western blot]] and [[ELISA]].

With the exception of culture or PCR, there is currently no practical means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for [[antibodies]] of ''Borrelia''. High [[titer]]s of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to ''Borrelia'' antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burdash N, Fernandes J |title=Lyme borreliosis: detecting the great imitator |journal=J Am Osteopath Assoc |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=573–4, 577–8 |year=1991 |month=June |pmid=1874654}}</ref>

Western blot, ELISA and PCR can be performed by either blood test via [[venipuncture]] or CSF via [[lumbar puncture]]. Though lumbar puncture is more definitive of diagnosis, antigen capture in the CSF is much more elusive; reportedly CSF yields positive results in only 10–30% of patients cultured. The diagnosis of neurologic infection by ''Borrelia'' should not be excluded solely on the basis of normal routine CSF or negative CSF antibody analyses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coyle PK, Schutzer SE, Deng Z, ''et al.'' |title=Detection of Borrelia burgdorferi-specific antigen in antibody-negative cerebrospinal fluid in neurologic Lyme disease |journal=Neurology |volume=45 |issue=11 |pages=2010–5 |year=1995 |month=November |pmid=7501150 |doi=10.1212/WNL.45.11.2010}}</ref>

New techniques for clinical testing of ''Borrelia'' infection have been developed, such as LTT-[[MELISA]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Valentine-Thon E, Ilsemann K, Sandkamp M |title=A novel lymphocyte transformation test (LTT-MELISA) for Lyme borreliosis |journal=Diagn.

Some laboratories offer Lyme disease testing using assays whose accuracy and clinical usefulness have not been adequately established. These tests include urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell wall-deficient forms of ''Borrelia burgdorferi'', and lymphocyte transformation tests. The CDC does not recommend these tests, and a 2005 review by Aguero-Rosenfeld, ''et al.'' in ''Clinical Microbiology Reviews'' stated their use is "of great concern and is strongly discouraged".<ref name="pmid16020686"/>

In addition to laboratory testing on patients, ticks can be tested after removal from the host. Several laboratories perform PCR testing on live or dead ticks for a panel of tick-borne diseases, including ''Borrelia'', ''[[Babesia]]'', and ''[[Ehrlichia]]''.<ref>{{cite web |authorlink=Igenex, Inc. |title=What You Should Know About Lyme Disease |publisher=International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society |url=http://www.ilads.org/lyme_research/lyme_articles6.html |accessdate = October 10, 2010}}</ref>

===Imaging===
[[Neuroimaging]] is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to [[neuroborreliosis]], but may aid in [[differential diagnosis]] and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease.<ref name="Hildenbrand2009">{{cite journal |author=Hildenbrand P, Craven DE, Jones R, Nemeskal P |title=Lyme neuroborreliosis: manifestations of a rapidly emerging zoonosis |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=1079–87 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19346313 |doi=10.3174/ajnr.A1579}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Protective clothing includes a hat, long-sleeved shirts and long trousers tucked into socks or boots. Light-colored clothing makes the tick more easily visible before it attaches itself. People should use special care in handling and allowing outdoor pets inside homes because they can bring ticks into the house.

[[Permethrin]] sprayed on clothing kills ticks on contact, and is sold for this purpose.

Attached ticks should be removed promptly, as removal within 36 hours can reduce transmission rates.<ref name="piesman2002">{{cite journal |author=Piesman J, Dolan MC |title=Protection against lyme disease spirochete transmission provided by prompt removal of nymphal Ixodes scapularis (Acari: Ixodidae) |journal=J.

A community can prevent Lyme disease by reducing the numbers of primary hosts on which the deer tick depends, such as rodents, other small mammals, and deer. Reduction of the deer population may, over time, help break the reproductive cycle of the deer ticks and their ability to flourish in suburban and rural areas.<ref>http://www.ct.gov/caes/lib/caes/documents/publications/bulletins/b1010.pdf{{full|date=March 2013}}</ref>

An unusual, organic approach to control of ticks and prevention of Lyme disease involves the use of [[domesticated guineafowl]]. Guineafowl are voracious consumers of insects and [[arachnid]]s, and have a particular fondness for ticks. Localized use of domesticated guineafowl may reduce dependence on chemical pest-control methods.<ref name="Duffy">{{cite journal |first1=David Cameron |last1=Duffy |first2=Randall |last2=Downer |first3=Christie |last3=Brinkley |year=1992 |title=The Effectiveness of Helmeted Guineafowl in the Control of the Deer Tick, the Vector of Lyme Disease |journal=The Wilson Bulletin |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages=342-5 |jstor=4163159 |url=http://www.guineafowl.com/fritsfarm/guineas/ticks/tickstudy.pdf}}</ref>

===Management of host animals===
Lyme and all other deer tick-borne diseases can be prevented on a regional level by reducing the deer population on which the ticks depend for reproductive success. This has been demonstrated in the communities of [[Monhegan, Maine]]<ref name="Rand">{{cite journal |author=Rand PW, Lubelczyk C, Holman MS, Lacombe EH, Smith RP |title=Abundance of Ixodes scapularis (Acari: Ixodidae) after the complete removal of deer from an isolated offshore island, endemic for Lyme Disease |journal=J.

For example, in the US, reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 per square mile (from the current levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates), the tick numbers can be brought down to levels too low to spread Lyme and other tick-borne diseases.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stafford |first=Kirby C. | title = Tick Management Handbook | url = http://www.ct.gov/caes/lib/caes/documents/special_features/TickHandbook.pdf | year = 2004 | publisher = Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station and Connecticut Department of Public Health | page =46 | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref> However, such a drastic reduction may be impractical in many areas. Routine veterinary control of [[ticks of domestic animals]], including livestock, by use of chemical acaricides can contribute to reducing exposure of humans to ticks. However, more recent research has shown that the risk of acquiring Lyme disease does not depend on the existence of a local deer population, as is commonly assumed. This research suggests eliminating deer from smaller areas {{convert|2.5|ha|acre|lk=on}} may in fact lead to an increase in tick density and the rise of "tick-borne disease hotspots".<ref name="Perkins">{{cite journal |author=Perkins SE, Cattadori IM, Tagliapietra V, Rizzoli AP, Hudson PJ |title=Localized deer absence leads to tick amplification |journal=Ecology |volume=87 |issue=8 |pages=1981–6 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16937637 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1981:LDALTT]2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

Action can be taken to avoid getting bitten by ticks by using insect repellants, for example those that contain [[DEET]] (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide).

===Vaccination===
A [[vaccine|recombinant vaccine]] against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of ''B. burgdorferi'', was developed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. In [[clinical trial]]s involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine, called LYMErix, was found to confer protective immunity to ''Borrelia'' in 76% of adults and 100% of children with only mild or moderate and transient [[adverse effect]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poland GA, Jacobson RM |title=The prevention of Lyme disease with vaccine |journal=Vaccine |volume=19 |issue=17-19 |pages=2303–8 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11257352 |doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(00)00520-X}}</ref> LYMErix was approved on the basis of these trials by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on December 21, 1998.

Following approval of the vaccine, its entry in clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/13/nyregion/lukewarm-response-to-new-lyme-vaccine.html | title = Lukewarm Response To New Lyme Vaccine | first = Claudia |last = Rowe | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = June 13, 1999 | accessdate = July 11, 2008}}</ref> Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] side effects. Supported by some patient advocacy groups, a number of [[class-action lawsuit]]s were filed against GlaxoSmithKline, alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems.

===Tick removal===
Folk remedies for tick removal tend to be ineffective, offer no advantages in preventing the transfer of disease, and may increase the risks of transmission or infection. The best method is simply to pull the tick out with tweezers as close to the skin as possible, without twisting, and avoiding crushing the body of the tick or removing the head from the tick's body.<ref name=JAMA_2007>{{cite journal |author=Zeller JL, Burke AE, Glass RM |title=JAMA patient page.

===Prevention in dogs===
Prevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventative measures are available. First of all, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations for their dogs is an important step.<ref name=pmid20207198>{{cite journal |author=Little SE, Heise SR, Blagburn BL, Callister SM, Mead PS |title=Lyme borreliosis in dogs and humans in the USA |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=213–8 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20207198 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2010.01.006}}</ref>

Another crucial preventative measure is the use of persistent [[acaricides]], such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes ([[Amitraz]]), phenylpyrazoles ([[Fipronil]]), or permethrin ([[Pyrethroids]]).<ref name=pmid20933139>{{cite journal |author=Krupka I, Straubinger RK |title=Lyme borreliosis in dogs and cats: background, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infections with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto |journal=Vet.

Examination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hahn|first=Jeffrey|title=Ticks and Their Control|url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/horticulture/DD1013.html|publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Antibiotics]] are the primary treatment for Lyme disease; the most appropriate antibiotic treatment depends upon the patient and the stage of the disease.<ref name=Sherris /> According to the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] (IDSA) guidelines, the antibiotics of choice are [[doxycycline]] (in adults), [[amoxicillin]] (in children), [[erythromycin]] (for pregnant women) and [[ceftriaxone]], with treatment lasting 10 to 28 days.<ref name=Bratton/>  If Lyme arthritis symptoms fail to respond to a 30-day antibiotic regimen, some recommend an additional 30 days of antibiotics.<ref name="MandellBennett2010">{{cite book|author1=Gerald L.

A double blind, randomized, [[placebo]]-controlled multicenter clinical study indicated three weeks of treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone, followed by 100 days of treatment with oral amoxicillin did not improve symptoms any more than just three weeks of treatment with ceftriaxone. The researchers noted the outcome should not be evaluated after the initial antibiotic treatment, but rather 6–12 months afterwards. In patients with chronic posttreatment symptoms, persistent positive levels of antibodies did not seem to provide any useful information for further care of the patient.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oksi J, Nikoskelainen J, Hiekkanen H, ''et al.'' |title=Duration of antibiotic treatment in disseminated Lyme borreliosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study |journal=Eur.

In later stages, the bacteria disseminate throughout the body and may cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], making the infection more difficult to treat. Late diagnosed Lyme is treated with oral or intravenous antibiotics, frequently [[ceftriaxone]] for a minimum of four weeks. [[Minocycline]] is also indicated for [[neuroborreliosis]] for its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Elewa HF, Hilali H, Hess DC, Machado LS, Fagan SC |title=Minocycline for short-term neuroprotection |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=515–21 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16553511 |pmc=3171989 |doi=10.1592/phco.26.4.515}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
For early cases, prompt treatment is usually curative.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krause PJ, Foley DT, Burke GS, Christianson D, Closter L, Spielman A |title=Reinfection and relapse in early Lyme disease |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1090–4 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17172372}}</ref> However, the severity and treatment of Lyme disease may be complicated due to late diagnosis, failure of antibiotic treatment, and simultaneous infection with other tick-borne diseases (coinfections), including [[ehrlichiosis]], [[babesiosis]], and immune suppression in the patient.

A [[meta-analysis]] published in 2005 found some patients with Lyme disease have fatigue, joint or muscle pain, and [[neurocognitive]] symptoms persisting for years, despite antibiotic treatment.<ref name="Cairns"/> Patients with late stage Lyme disease have been shown to experience a level of physical [[disability]] equivalent to that seen in [[congestive heart failure]].<ref name="Klempner">{{cite journal |author=Klempner MS, Hu LT, Evans J, ''et al.'' |title=Two controlled trials of antibiotic treatment in patients with persistent symptoms and a history of Lyme disease |journal=N.

Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons.

Effective January 2008, the CDC gives equal weight to laboratory evidence from 1) a positive culture for ''B. burgdorferi''; 2) two-tier testing (ELISA screening and Western blot confirming); or 3) single-tier IgG (old infection) Western blot.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Previously, the CDC only included laboratory evidence based on (1) and (2) in their surveillance case definition. The case definition now includes the use of Western blot without prior ELISA screen.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/osels/ph_surveillance/nndss/casedef/lyme_disease_2008.htm "Lyme Disease (Borrelia burgdorferi) 2008 Case Definition"]. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).</ref>

The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America. For example, ''B. burgdorferi sensu lato'' was previously thought to be hindered in its ability to be maintained in an [[enzootic]] cycle in [[California]], because it was assumed the large lizard population would dilute the prevalence of ''B. burgdorferi'' in local tick populations; this has since been brought into question, as some evidence has suggested lizards can become infected.<ref name="pmid17417956" />

While ''B. burgdorferi'' is most associated with ticks hosted by [[white-tailed deer]] and [[White-footed Mouse|white-footed mice]], ''Borrelia afzelii'' is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and ''Borrelia garinii'' and ''Borrelia valaisiana'' appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for ''B. burgdorferi sensu stricto''. The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association.{{fact|date=March 2013}}

Several similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of Borrelia in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to Borrelia infection is [[southern tick-associated rash illness]] (STARI), also known as Masters' disease. [[Amblyomma americanum]], known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so patients in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms—especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick—should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment.{{fact|date=March 2013}}

Although Montana is the only state that has not reported a confirmed case of Lyme disease, in recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme.   It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

Lyme disease prevalence is comparable among males and females.  A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10 - 19 year-olds.  For unknown reasons, Lyme disease is seven times more common among Asians.<ref>[http://voxhealth.org/project/diaginfo.php?diag=Lyme+disease&rfv1=&rfv2=&rfv3=&diag=08881 Lyme disease fact sheet] Analysis of CDC data on VoxHealth.

==History==
The evolutionary history of ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' genetics has been the subject of recent studies. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the mid-west that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease was present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoen AG, Margos G, Bent SJ, ''et al.'' |title=Phylogeography of Borrelia burgdorferi in the eastern United States reflects multiple independent Lyme disease emergence events |journal=Proc.

John Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663–1670, wrote "there be infinite numbers of tikes hanging upon the bushes in summer time that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man.

This is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm, a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus, and who found the forests of New York "abound" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.<ref>{{cite book |last=Drymon |first=M.M. |year=2008 |title=Disguised as the Devil: How Lyme disease Created Witches and Changed History |page=51 |isbn=978-0-615-20061-3}}</ref>

Perhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of [[Reverend Dr John Walker]] after a visit to the [[Island of Jura]] (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.311.7018.1478 |title=Lyme disease in the eighteenth century |year=1995 |author=Summerton N |journal=BMJ |volume=311 |issue=7018 |pages=1478}}</ref> He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with "exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a "worm" with a body which is "of a reddish colour and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side" that "penetrates the skin". Many people from this area of Great Britain immigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century.

The examination of preserved museum specimens has found ''Borrelia'' DNA in an infected ''Ixodes ricinus'' tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894.<ref>{{cite book |last=Drymon |first=M.M. |year=2008 |title=Disguised as the Devil: How Lyme disease Created Witches and Changed History |page=52 |isbn=978-0-615-20061-3}}</ref> The 2010 autopsy of [[Ötzi the Iceman]], a 5,300 year old [[mummy]], revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease.<ref name="ngautopsy">{{cite news | first = Stephen S. | last = Hall | url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/11/iceman-autopsy/hall-text | title = Iceman Autopsy | date = November 2011 | accessdate = October 17, 2011 | publisher= [[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]] }}</ref>

The early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in [[Breslau]], Germany (now [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]] ), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who had suffered for 16 years with a degenerative [[skin disorder]] now known as [[acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans]].<ref name="Afzelius1910">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01832773 |title=Verhandlungen der dermatologischen Gesellschaft zu Stockholm |year=1910 |last1=Marcus |first1=Karl |journal=Archiv für Dermatologie und Syphilis |volume=101 |issue=2–3 |pages=403–6}}</ref>

===20th century===
At a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist [[Arvid Afzelius]] presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion ''erythema migrans''.<ref name="Afzelius1910" /> The skin condition now known as [[borrelial lymphocytoma]] was first described in 1911.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Burckhardt JL | title = Zur Frage der Follikel- und Keimzentrenbildung in der Haut | journal = Frankfurter Zeitschrift fur Pathologie | language = German | year = 1911 | volume = 6 | pages = 352–359}}</ref>

Neurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory [[radiculitis]] accompanied by mild [[meningitis]] following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hellerström S | title = Erythema chronicum migrans Afzelii | journal = Archiv Dermatologie and Venereologie (Stockholm) | language = German | year = 1930 | volume = 11 | pages = 315–321}}</ref> In the 1940s, German neurologist [[Alfred Bannwarth]] described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.

Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the [[Karolinska Institute]] in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he used a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lenhoff C | title =Spirochetes in aetiologically obscure diseases | journal = Acta Dermato-Venreol | year = 1948 | volume = 28 | pages = 295–324}}</ref> Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin.<ref name="pmid18140373">{{cite journal |author=Thyresson N |title=The penicillin treatment of acrodermatitis atrophicans chronica (Herxheimer) |journal=Acta Derm.

In 1970, a dermatologist in [[Wisconsin]] named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a patient after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the patient with penicillin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scrimenti RJ |title=Erythema chronicum migrans |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=104–5 |year=1970 |month=July |pmid=5497158 |doi=10.1001/archderm.102.1.104}}</ref>

The full [[syndrome]] now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]] was identified in three towns in southeastern [[Connecticut]] in 1975, including the towns [[Lyme, Connecticut|Lyme]] and [[Old Lyme]], which gave the disease its popular name.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Steere AC |title=Lyme borreliosis in 2005, 30 years after initial observations in Lyme Connecticut |journal=Wien.

In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed "poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes." Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the "long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease." Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and [[Blood serum|sera]] from patients diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour "offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism." Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from patients with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burgdorfer W |title=Discovery of the Lyme disease spirochete and its relation to tick vectors |journal=Yale J Biol Med |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=515–20 |year=1984 |pmid=6516454 |pmc=2590008}}</ref> In June 1982, he published his findings in [[Science (journal)|Science]], and the spirochete was named ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' in his honor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burgdorfer W, Barbour AG, Hayes SF, Benach JL, Grunwaldt E, Davis JP |title=Lyme disease-a tick-borne spirochetosis? |journal=Science |volume=216 |issue=4552 |pages=1317–9 |year=1982 |month=June |pmid=7043737 |doi=10.1126/science.7043737}}</ref>

After the identification of ''B. burgdorferi'' as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by ''in vitro'' antibiotic sensitivities, including [[tetracycline antibiotics]], [[amoxicillin]], [[cefuroxime axetil]], intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous [[ceftriaxone]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Luft BJ, Volkman DJ, Halperin JJ, Dattwyler RJ |title=New chemotherapeutic approaches in the treatment of Lyme borreliosis |journal=Ann.

Jonathan Edlow, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, quotes the late Ed Masters (discoverer of [[Southern tick-associated rash illness|STARI]], a Lyme-like illness) in his book ''Bull's-Eye'', on the history of Lyme disease. Edlow writes:

{{quote|Masters points out that the "track record" of the "conventional wisdom" regarding Lyme disease is not very good: "First off, they said it was a new disease, which it wasn't. Then it was thought to be viral, but it isn't. Then it was thought that sero-negativity didn't exist, which it does. They thought it was easily treated by short courses of antibiotics, which sometimes it isn't. Then it was only the ''Ixodes dammini'' tick, which we now know is not even a separate valid tick species. If you look throughout the history, almost every time a major dogmatic statement has been made about what we 'know' about this disease, it was subsequently proven wrong or underwent major modifications."|<ref>{{cite book |first=Jonathan A. |last=Edlow |year=2003 |title=Bull's-Eye: Unraveling the Medical Mystery of Lyme Disease |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-09867-7}}{{pn|date=March 2013}}</ref>}}

==Society and culture==
[[Urbanization]] and other [[anthropogenic]] factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents&nbsp;– the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased.<ref name="LoGiudice">{{cite journal |author=LoGiudice K, Ostfeld RS, Schmidt KA, Keesing F |title=The ecology of infectious disease: effects of host diversity and community composition on Lyme disease risk |journal=Proc.

The Center for Disease Control states that "approximately 10 to 20% of patients treated for Lyme disease with a recommended 2-4 week course of antibiotics will have lingering symptoms of fatigue, pain, or joint and muscle aches.

One usage refers to people suffering from the symptoms of untreated and disseminated late-stage Lyme disease: [[arthritis]], [[peripheral neuropathy]] and/or [[encephalomyelitis]]. The term is also applied to people who have had the disease in the past and some symptoms remain after antibiotic treatment, which is also called post-Lyme disease syndrome.

===Controversy and politics===
While there is general agreement on the optimal treatment for early Lyme disease, there is considerable controversy over the existence, [[prevalence]], diagnostic criteria, and treatment of "chronic" Lyme disease.<ref name=Tonks/><ref name="Ballantyne 2008">{{cite journal |author=Ballantyne C |title=The chronic debate over Lyme disease|journal=Nat.

A minority view holds that chronic Lyme disease is responsible for a range of unexplained symptoms, sometimes in people without any evidence of past infection.<ref name="Ballantyne 2008"/> This viewpoint is promoted by many patient advocates, notably an advocacy organization,<ref name=Tonks>{{cite journal |author=Tonks A |title=Lyme wars |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7626 |pages=910–2 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17974685 |pmc=2048873 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39363.530961.AD|url=http://medical.wesrch.com/pdf_file/LYY_1206297464/lyme_wars.pdf}}</ref> the International Lyme And Associated Diseases Society.<ref name="Stricker 2007"/> Groups of patients, patient advocates, and the small number of physicians who support the concept of chronic Lyme disease have organized to lobby for recognition of this diagnosis, as well as to argue for insurance coverage of long-term antibiotic therapy, which most insurers deny, as it is at odds with the guidelines of major medical organizations.<ref name="Ballantyne 2008"/><ref name="forbes">{{cite news | author = Whelan, David |url = http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0312/096.html |title = Lyme Inc |work = [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] | date = 2007-03-12 | accessdate = 2008-06-24}}</ref>

In 2006, [[Richard Blumenthal]], the [[Connecticut Attorney General]], opened an [[antitrust]] investigation against the IDSA, accusing the IDSA Lyme disease panel of undisclosed [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] and of unduly dismissing alternative therapies and chronic Lyme disease.

In 2001, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' reported that [[Allen Steere]], chief of immunology and rheumatology at [[Tufts Medical Center]] and a co-discoverer and leading expert on Lyme disease, had been harassed, stalked, and threatened by patients and patient advocacy groups angry at his refusal to substantiate their diagnoses of "chronic" Lyme disease and endorse long-term antibiotic therapy.<ref name="nyt-steere">{{cite news|author=Grann, David |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/17/magazine/17LYMEDISEASE.html |title=Stalking Dr. Steere Over Lyme Disease |work = [[The New York Times Magazine]] |date = 2001-06-17 |accessdate = 2008-06-25}}</ref> Because this intimidation included death threats, Steere was assigned security guards.<ref name="uphill"/> Paul G.
