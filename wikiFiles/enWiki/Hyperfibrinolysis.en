The [[fibrinolysis]] system is responsible for removing blood clots. '''Hyperfibrinolysis''' describes a situation with markedly enhanced fibrinolytic activity, resulting in increased, sometimes catastrophic bleeding. Hyperfibrinolysis can be caused by acquired or [[congenital]] reasons. Among the congenital conditions for hyperfibrinolysis, deficiency of alpha-2-antiplasmin<ref>Carpenter SL, Mathew P. Alpha-2-antiplasmin and its deficiency: fibrinolysis out of balance. Haemophilia, 2008;14:1250-4</ref> (alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor) or plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ([[PAI-1]])<ref>Takahashi Y, Tanaka T, Minowa H et al. Hereditary partial deficiency of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 associated with a lifelong bleeding tendency. Int J Hematol 1996;64:61-8</ref> are very rare. The affected individuals show a [[hemophilia]]-like bleeding phenotype. Acquired hyperfibrinolysis is found in [[liver disease]],<ref>Goerlinger K. Coagulation management during liver transplantation.

Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2007;6:700-4</ref> and other conditions. A special situation with temporarily enhanced fibrinolysis is  [[thrombolytic therapy]] with drugs which activate [[plasminogen]], e.g. for use in acute [[ischemic]] events or in patients with stroke. In patients with severe trauma, hyperfibrinolysis is associated with poor outcome.<ref>Schöchl H. Hyperfibrinolysis:a prognostic marker of poor survival following major trauma? Haemostaseologie 2008;28:A57(P-04-11)</ref>

Bleeding is caused by the generation of [[fibrinogen]] degradation products which interfere with regular [[fibrin]] polymerization and inhibit [[platelet]] aggregation. Moreover, plasmin which is formed in excess in hyperfibrinolysis can proteolytically activate or inactivate many plasmatic or cellular proteins involved in hemostasis. Especially the degradation of fibrinogen, an essential protein for platelet aggregation and clot stability, may be a major cause for clinical bleeding.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis is made indirectly with immunochemical methods which detect the elevation of [[biomarkers]] such as D-Dimer (cross-linked fibrin degradation products), fibrinogen split products (FSP), complexes of plasmin and alpha-2-antiplasmin (PAP). However, the [[sensitivity and specificity]] of these methods is limited because elevation of these biomarkers can also occur induced in other [[Illness|clinical]] conditions. The classical [[coagulation]] tests such as PT ([[prothrombin time]]), aPTT ([[activated partial thromboplastin time]]) or [[thrombin time]] are not very sensitive for hyperfibrinolysis, and influenced by numerous other variables. The [[euglobulin lysis time]] test is very time consuming and complex. [[Viscoelastic]] methods in whole blood, especially [[thromboelastometry]] (TEM) when performed with special reagents detect hyperfibrinolysis very sensitively in a functional approach. The APTEM test, a [[tissue factor]] activated, [[heparin]] insensitive test performed in the presence of [[aprotinin]] (fibrinolysis inhibitor, confirms hyperfibrinolysis by comparing the TEM result of this assay with the EXTEM test (same activator, but without aprotinin). A normalization or improvement of the TEMogram in APTEM versus EXTEM confirms hyperfibrinolysis.<ref>Vorweg M, Hartmann B, Knüttgen D, Jahn MC, Doehn M. Management of fulminant fibrinolysis during abdominal aortic surgery. J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth 2001;15:764</ref> This in vitro approach can predict to a certain level if normal clot formation can be restored by use of an antifibrinolytic drug.

==Treatment==

Since the use of aprotinin has been abandoned due to major side effects, the treatment or prophylaxis of hyperfibrinolysis is made with synthetic drugs such as [[tranexamic acid]], [[epsilon-aminocaproic acid]] or other [[lysine]] analogues. When used appropriately, antifibriolytic drugs may avoid unnecessary [[transfusions]].<ref>Diprose P, Herbertson MJ, O´Shaughnessy D, Deakin CD, Gill RS.
