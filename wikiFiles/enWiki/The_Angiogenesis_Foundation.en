'''The Angiogenesis Foundation''', is a [[United States]] [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] established in 1994 for the study of [[angiogenesis]]. The founders were former students of Dr. [[Judah Folkman]], a pioneer of angiogenesis research.

The foundation focuses on treatments in the areas of [[cancer]], [[cardiology]], [[wound healing]], [[dermatology]], and [[ophthalmology]].

The foundation developed a therapy for canine cancer, called the Navy Protocol.  This treatment works by starving the tumor of its blood supply.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-07-24-cover-cancer_x.htm Dog's tale of survival opens door in cancer research, July 24, 2002]</ref>
