'''Glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism''' ('''GRA'''), also describable as ''aldosterone synthase hyperactivity'', is an [[autosomal dominant]] disorder in which the increase in [[aldosterone]] secretion produced by [[ACTH]] is no longer transient. 

It is a cause of [[primary hyperaldosteronism]].<ref name="pmid17277347">{{cite journal |author=Vonend O, Altenhenne C, Büchner NJ, ''et al.'' |title=A German family with glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism |journal=Nephrol.

{{main | Aldosterone synthase}}

[[Aldosterone synthase]] is a [[steroid]] [[hydroxylase]] [[cytochrome P450]] oxidase enzyme involved in the generation of [[aldosterone]]. It is localized to the [[mitochondrial]] inner membrane. The enzyme has steroid [[18-hydroxylase]] activity to synthesize [[aldosterone]] and other steroids. Aldosterone synthase is found within the [[zona glomerulosa]] at the outer edge of the [[adrenal cortex]]. Aldosterone synthase normally is not ACTH sensitive, and only activated by [[angiotensin II]].

Aldosterone causes the [[tubules]] of the [[kidneys]] to retain [[sodium]] and [[water]]. This increases the volume of fluid in the body, and drives up [[blood pressure]].

Steroid hormones are synthesized from [[cholesterol]] within the [[adrenal cortex]]. [[Aldosterone]] and [[corticosterone]] share the first part of their biosynthetic pathway. The last part is either mediated by the aldosterone synthase (for aldosterone) or by the [[11β-hydroxylase]] (for [[corticosterone]]).

:'''[[Steroid metabolism|Aldosterone synthesis]] is stimulated by several factors:'''
::by increase in the plasma concentration of [[angiotensin III]].
::by increased plasma [[angiotensin II]], [[ACTH]], or [[potassium]] levels.
::The [[ACTH stimulation test]] is sometimes used to stimulate the production of aldosterone along with [[cortisol]] to determine if primary or secondary [[adrenal insufficiency]] is present.
::by plasma [[acidosis]].
::by the [[stretch receptors]] located in the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]] of the [[heart]].
::by [[adrenoglomerulotropin]], a [[lipid]] factor, obtained from [[pineal]] extracts. It selectively stimulates secretion of aldosterone.
::The secretion of aldosterone has a [[diurnal rhythm]].

:'''Control of aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex:'''
::*The role of the [[renin-angiotensin system]]:
:::Angiotensin is involved in regulating aldosterone and is the core regulator. Angiotensin II acts synergistically with potassium.
::*The role of [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] [[nerves]]:
:::Aldosterone production is also affected to one extent or another by [[nervous control]] which integrates the inverse of [[carotid artery]] pressure, [[pain]], [[Human position|posture]], and probably [[emotion]] ([[anxiety]], [[fear]], and [[hostility]])(including [[surgical stress]]).
::*The role of [[baroreceptors]]:
:::Pressure in the [[carotid artery]] decreases aldosterone
::*The role of the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]]
::*The plasma concentration of [[potassium]]:
:::The amount of aldosterone secreted is a direct function of the serum potassium as probably determined by sensors in the carotid artery.
::*The plasma concentration of [[sodium]]:
:::Aldosterone is a function of the [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of the sodium intake as sensed via [[osmotic pressure]].
::*Miscellaneous regulation:
:::[[ACTH]], a [[pituitary]] peptide, also has some stimulating effect on aldosterone probably by stimulating [[deoxycorticosterone]] formation which is a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of [[aldosterone]].
:::Aldosterone is increased by [[hemorrhage|blood loss]], [[pregnancy]], and possibly by other circumstances such as [[physical exertion]], [[endotoxin shock]], and [[burn]]s.

:'''Aldosterone [[feedback]]:'''
::Feedback by aldosterone concentration itself is of a non-morphological character (that is, other than changes in cell number or structure) and is relatively poor, so that electrolyte feedback predominates in the short term.

==Pathophysiology==
The [[genes]] encoding [[aldosterone synthase]] and [[11-hydroxylase]] are 95% identical and are close together on [[chromosome 8]]. In individuals with GRA, there is unequal crossing over so that the [[5']] regulatory region of the 11-hydroxylase gene is fused to the coding region of the aldosterone synthase. 

The product of this hybrid gene is [[aldosterone synthase]] that is ACTH-sensitive<ref>Ganong Physiology</ref> in the [[zona fasciculata]] of the adrenal gland.<ref name="pmid14667264">{{cite journal |author=McMahon GT, Dluhy RG |title=Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism |journal=Cardiol Rev |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=44–8 |year=2004 |pmid=14667264 |doi=10.1097/01.crd.0000096417.42861.ce |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1061-5377&volume=12&issue=1&spage=44}}</ref>

Although in normal subjects, ACTH accelerates the [[steroid metabolism|first step of aldosterone synthesis]], [[ACTH]] normally has no effect on the activity of [[aldosterone synthase]]. However, in subjects with glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, ACTH increases the activity of existing [[aldosterone synthase]], resulting in an abnormally high rate of aldosterone synthesis and [[hyperaldosteronism]].

==Symptoms==
Patients with GRA may be [[asymptomatic]], but the following symptoms can be present:

* [[Fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]]
* [[Headache]]
* [[High blood pressure]]
* [[Hypokalemia]]
* Intermittent or temporary [[paralysis]]
* [[Muscle spasms]]
* [[Muscle weakness]]
* [[Numbness]]
* [[Polyuria]]
* [[Polydipsia]]
* Tingling
* [[Hypernatraemia]]
* [[Metabolic alkalosis]]

==Treatment==
In GRA, the hypersecretion of aldosterone and the accompanying [[hypertension]] are remedied when ACTH secretion is suppressed by administering [[glucocorticoids]]. 

[[Dexamethasone]], [[spironolactone]] and [[eplerenone]] have been used in treatment.<ref name="pmid15761539">{{cite journal |author=McMahon GT, Dluhy RG |title=Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism |journal=Arq Bras Endocrinol Metabol |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=682–6 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15761539 |doi= 10.1590/S0004-27302004000500014|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0004-27302004000500014&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref>
