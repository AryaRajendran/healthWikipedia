'''Traditional medicine''' (also known as '''indigenous or [[folk medicine]]''') comprises knowledge systems that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern [[medicine]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} 

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines traditional medicine as:

:"the health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and mineral-based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat, diagnose and prevent illnesses or maintain well-being."<ref name = WHO>{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs134/en/index.html | title = Fact sheet no. 134:  Traditional medicine | date = 2008-12-01 | accessdate = 2009-05-02 | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] }}</ref>

In some [[Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their [[primary health care]] needs.  When adopted outside of its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often called [[Alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicine]].<ref name = WHO/>

The WHO also notes, though, that "inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects" and that "further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety" of several of the practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems.<ref name = WHO/>  Core disciplines which study traditional medicine include [[herbalism]], [[ethnomedicine]], [[ethnobotany]], and [[medical anthropology]].

Traditional medicine may include formalized aspects of [[folk medicine]], i.e. longstanding remedies passed on and practiced by lay people. Practices known as traditional medicines include [[Ayurveda]], [[Siddha medicine]], [[Unani]], [[Ancient Iranian Medicine|ancient Iranian medicine]], [[Irani Traditional medicine|Irani]], [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Islamic medicine]], [[traditional Vietnamese medicine]], [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[traditional Korean medicine]], [[acupuncture]], [[Muti]],  [[Ifá]], [[traditional African medicine]], and many other forms of healing practices.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Classical history ==
In the written record, the study of herbs dates back 5,000 years to the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, who described well-established medicinal uses for plants. [[Ancient Egyptian medicine]] of 1000 BC are known to have used various herbs for medicine. The [[Old Testament]] also mentions herb use and cultivation in regards to [[Kashrut]]. 

Many herbs and minerals used in [[Ayurveda]] were described by ancient Indian herbalists such as [[Charaka]] and [[Sushruta]] during the 1st millennium BC.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Girish Dwivedi|first=Shridhar Dwivedi|year=2007|title=History of Medicine: Sushruta – the Clinician – Teacher par Excellence|publisher=[[National Informatics Centre]]|url=http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref> The first [[Chinese herbology|Chinese herbal]] book was the ''[[Shennong|Shennong Bencao Jing]]'', compiled during the [[Han Dynasty]] but dating back to a much earlier date, which was later augmented as the ''[[Yaoxing Lun]]'' (''Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs'') during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. Early recognised Greek compilers of existing and current herbal knowledge include [[Pythagoreanism]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Aristotle]], [[Theophrastus]], [[Dioscorides]] and [[Galen]].

Roman writers included [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]].<ref name = Kay1996>{{cite book | last = Kay | first = MA | year = 1996 | title = Healing with plants in the American and Mexican West | isbn = 0-8165-1646-4 | publisher = [[University of Arizona Press]] | pages = 19&ndash;20 | location = Tucson }}</ref> [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] included the writings of the herbalist Krateuas, physician to Mithridates VI King of Pontus from 120 to 63 BC in his ''[[Materia medica|De Materia Medica]]''.  ''De Materia Medica'' was translated into several languages and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] names were added to it throughout the centuries.<ref name= Blunt1994>{{cite book |author=Raphael, Sandra; Blunt, Wilfrid |title=The Illustrated herbal |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-7112-0914-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Latin manuscripts of De Materia Medica were combined with a Latin herbal by [[Pseudo-Apuleius|Apuleius Platonicus]] (''[[Herbarium Apuleii Platonici]]'') and were incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon [[codex]] ''Cotton Vitellius C.III''. 

These early Greek and Roman compilations became the backbone of European medical theory and were translated by the Persian [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sīnā, 980&ndash;1037), the Persian [[Rhazes]] (Rāzi, 865&ndash;925) and the Jewish [[Maimonides]].<ref name = Kay1996/> Translations of Greek medical handbooks and manuscripts into Arabic took place in the eighth and ninth centuries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic indigenous medicine]] developed from the conflict between the magic-based medicine of the [[Bedouin]]s and the Arabic translations of the Hellenic and [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medical traditions.<ref>{{cite book |author=Slikkerveer, L.

The [[Unani]] system of traditional medicine is also based on the ''Canon''.

Translations of the early Roman-Greek compilations were made into German by [[Hieronymus Bock]] whose herbal published in 1546 was called ''Kreuter Buch''.  The book was translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as ''Pemptades'' by [[Rembert Dodoens]] (1517&ndash;1585), and from Dutch into [[English language|English]] by [[Carolus Clusius]], (1526&ndash;1609), published by [[Henry Lyte (botanist)|Henry Lyte]] in 1578 as ''A Nievve Herball''. This became [[John Gerard]]'s (1545&ndash;1612) ''Herball or General Hiftorie of Plantes''.<ref name = Kay1996/><ref name = Blunt1994/>  Each new work was a compilation of existing texts with new additions.

Women's folk knowledge existed in undocumented parallel with these texts.<ref name = Kay1996/>  Forty-four drugs, diluents, flavouring agents and [[emollient]]s mentioned by Discorides are still listed in the official pharmacopoeias of Europe.<ref name = Blunt1994/> The [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Puritans]] took Gerard's work to the [[United States]] where it influenced American Indigenous medicine.<ref name = Kay1996/> 

[[Francisco Hernández de Toledo|Francisco Hernández]], physician to [[Philip II of Spain]] spent the years 1571–1577 gathering information in [[Mexico]] and then wrote ''Rerum Medicarum Novae Hispaniae Thesaurus'', many versions of which have been published including one by [[Francisco Ximénez]]. Both Hernandez and Ximenez fitted [[Aztec]] ethnomedicinal information into the European concepts of disease such as "warm", "cold", and "moist", but it is not clear that the Aztec’s used these categories.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Ortiz de Montellano | first = B | title = Empirical Aztec medicine | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | year = 1975 | volume = 188 | pages = 215&ndash;20 | pmid = 1090996  | issue = 4185 | doi = 10.1126/science.1090996 }}</ref> [[Juan de Esteyneffer]]'s ''Florilegio medicinal de todas las enfermedas'' compiled European texts and added 35 Mexican plants. 

Martín de la Cruz wrote an herbal in [[Nahuatl]] which was translated into [[Latin]] by [[Juan Badiano]] as ''[[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis]]'' or ''Codex Barberini, Latin 241'' and given to King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]] of Spain in 1552.<ref name = Heinrich2005>{{cite book | last = Heinrich | first = M | coauthors =  Pieroni A; Bremner P; | year = 2005 | chapter = Plants as medicines | editors = Prance G & Nesbitt M |isbn = 0-415-92746-3 | title = The Cultural history of plants | publisher = [[Routledge]] | pages = 205–238}}</ref>  It was apparently written in haste{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and influenced by the European occupation of the previous 30 years. Fray [[Bernadino de Sahagún]]'s used [[ethnographic]] methods to compile his codices that then became the ''Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva Espana'', published in 1793.<ref name = Heinrich2005/> Castore Durante published his ''Herbario Nuovo'' in 1585 describing medicinal plants from Europe and the East and [[West Indies]]. It was translated into German in 1609 and Italian editions were published for the next century.

== Knowledge transmission and creation ==
Indigenous medicine is generally transmitted [[Oral tradition|orally]] through a community, family and individuals until "collected". Within a given culture, elements of indigenous medicine knowledge may be diffusely known by many, or may be gathered and applied by those in a specific role of healer such as a [[Shamanism|shaman]] or [[Midwifery|midwife]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Acharya | first = D | coauthors = Anshu S | year = 2008 | title = Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices | publisher = Aavishkar Publishers  | location = [[Jaipur]] | isbn = 978-81-7910-252-7}}</ref>  Three factors legitimize the role of the healer &ndash; their own beliefs, the success of their actions and the beliefs of the community.  When the claims of indigenous medicine become rejected by a culture, generally three types of adherents still use it &ndash; those born and socialized in it who become permanent believers, temporary believers who turn to it in crisis times, and those who only believe in specific aspects, not in all of it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Laguerre, Michel S. |title=Afro-Caribbean folk medicine |publisher=Bergin & Garvey |location=New York |year=1987 |pages= |isbn=0-89789-113-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=August 2008}}  

Elements in a specific culture are not necessarily integrated into a coherent system, and may be contradictory.  In the [[Caribbean]], indigenous remedies fall into several classes: certain well-known European medicinal herbs introduced by the early Spaniard colonists that are still commonly cultivated; indigenous wild and cultivated plants, the uses of which have been adopted from the Amerindians; and ornamental or other plants of relatively recent introduction for which curative uses have been invented without any historical basis.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Morton | first= JF | year = 1975 | title = Current folk remedies of northern Venezuela | journal =  Quarterly Journal of Crude Drug Research | volume = 13 | pages =97&ndash;121}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=August 2008}}

Rights of ownership may be claimed in indigenous medical knowledge.  Use of such knowledge  without Prior Informed Consent of or compensation to those claiming such ownership may be termed 'biopiracy'.  See [[Commercialization of indigenous knowledge]], also the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (in particular Article 8j and the Nagoya Protocol).

==Use of endangered species==
[[File:Slow loris - dried 01.JPG|thumb|right|Sometimes traditional medicines include parts of endangered species, such as the [[slow loris]] in Southeast Asia.]]
Endangered animals, such as the [[slow loris]], are sometimes used to make traditional medicines.<ref>{{cite doi | 10.1017/S0030605310001316}}</ref>
