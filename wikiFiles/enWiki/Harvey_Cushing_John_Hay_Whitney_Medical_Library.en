The '''Harvey Cushing and John Hay Whitney Medical Library''' is the central library of the [[Yale School of Medicine]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Previously known as the '''Yale Medical Library''', it is one of the finest modern medical libraries. The library is also renowned for its special and historical collections. 
 
The library was built in 1941 as a Y-shaped addition to the Sterling Hall of Medicine designed by [[Grosvenor Atterbury]] with funds from the estate of [[John William Sterling]]. The library was renovated and enlarged in 1990 with funds from [[Betsey Cushing|Betsey Cushing Whitney]]. The architects were Alexander Purves and Allan Dehar. After the renovation, the library was named for Betsey Cushing Whitney's father, [[Harvey Cushing]], the pioneering neurosurgeon, Yale graduate and faculty member, and her husband, [[John Hay Whitney]], the businessman, Yale graduate and philanthropist.<ref>[http://www.facilities.yale.edu/Campus/Building1.asp?LstBldg=3110 Yale Buildings and Grounds]</ref>
