{{Health care reform in the United States}}
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}

'''Free-market health care''' is a [[health care system|health care proposal]] in which all health care is bought and sold without government regulation, oversight, approval, and licensing.<ref>[http://blog.mises.org/archives/002383.asp Medical Economics: The Austrian point of view (lecture 24 of 32) ]</ref> Proponents state that this system increase health care quality and lower [[medical insurance]] costs.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Relentless Process of Socializing Health Care|url=http://mises.org/story/2946}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mises Daily Index - Canadian Health Care|url=http://mises.org/story/496}}</ref> They contend that systems like [[single-payer health care]] and [[publicly funded health care]] result in higher costs, inefficiency, longer waiting times for care, denial of care to some, and overall mismanagement.<ref name=stossel/>

Skeptics argue that health care as an unregulated commodity invokes market failures not present with government regulation and that selling health care as a commodity leads to both unfair and inefficient systems with poorer individuals being unable to afford preventive care.<ref name=scott/> It has also been contended that such a system is inherently selfish, and leads to unnecessary death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-usmvYOPfco|title=Alan Grayson on the GOP Health Care Plan: "Don't Get Sick!

==Positions==
Free-market health care advocates assert that:
*[[Patent]]s on [[pharmaceutical]]s make medication more expensive and encourages excessive [[advertising]] of their drugs, compared to non-patented remedies. Therefore, they oppose patents on pharmaceuticals.<ref name=four>{{Cite web|title=The Free Market: Four-Step Health Care Solution, A|url=http://mises.org/freemarket_detail.aspx?control=279|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>
Laws requiring prescriptions for drugs increase the cost of health care by forcing individuals to seek permission from state-sanctioned physicians to purchase drugs.
*[[Medical schools]] and [[public education]] teach [[conventional medicine]] and disregards [[alternative medicine]]. Therefore, they detract government funding of [[medical school]]s and [[education]].<ref>[http://mises.org/daily/1456 Health Care in Prison]</ref><ref>[http://www.lewrockwell.com/shaffer/shaffer149.html http://www.lewrockwell.com/shaffer/shaffer149.html]</ref>
*[[medical license|Medical licensing]] of medical doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies drive up health care prices because it produces a [[artificial scarcity|scarcity in health practitioners]]. Therefore, they want to eliminate government licensing and instead advocate market-based certification.<ref name=four/><ref>[http://mises.org/story/1749 How Medical Boards Nationalized Health Care]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Socialized Healthcare Is Not Cheaper Than Free Market Healthcare|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig7/crovelli7.html}}</ref>
*[[Tariff]]s on imported drugs and herbs raise the price while producing no economic benefit. Abolishing all tariffs will result in a [[comparative advantage]], thus benefit both parties.<ref name=four/>

== Debates and arguments ==
{{Main|Health care reform debate in the United States}}
Critics of a free market based system such as Eben Harrell of ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' argue that the evidence is that in the [[United Kingdom]], which operates a truly [[socialized medicine|socialized health care system]], many health outcomes are as good as and sometimes better than in the US where health care has a much lower involvement by government. They concede that the U.S. ranks better on some criteria such as cancer mortality rates. They also argue based on the fact that the cost of health care in the UK is $2,500 per annum compared to $6,000 per annum in the US, although people in the US with comprehensive medical insurance can face shorter waiting lists.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1916570,00.html|title=Is Britain's Health-Care System Really That Bad?|publisher=''[[Time Magazine|Time]]''|date=August 18, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009|first=Eben|last=Harrell}}</ref> [[Arthur Kellermann|Dr. Arthur Kellermann]], Associate Dean for health policy at [[Emory University]], has stated that allocating health care by ability to pay rather than by anticipated medical benefits in the US makes its system more unproductive, with poor people avoiding preventive care and eventually using expensive emergency treatment.<ref name=scott>{{citenews|title=Doctors Say Health Care Rationing Already Exists|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106168331|accessdate=September 7, 2009|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]: ''[[All Things Considered]]''|date=July 1, 2009|first=Scott|last=Horsley}}</ref>

[[John Stossel]], an investigative reporter and a supporter of an unbundled commodity system, has remarked that "Insurance invites waste. That's a reason health care costs so much, and is often so consumer-unfriendly. In the few areas where there are free markets in health care -- such as cosmetic medicine and Lasik eye surgery -- customer service is great, and prices continue to drop."<ref name=stossel>{{citenews|author=[[John Stossel]]|title= Health Insurance Isn't All It's Cracked Up to Be|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/PrescriptionForChange/story?id=2574980&page=1|date=October 16, 2006|accessdate=September 27, 2009|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref> Republican Senator and medical doctor [[Tom Coburn]] has stated that the [[Health care in Switzerland|healthcare system in]] [[Switzerland]] should serve as a model for U.S. reform. He wrote for ''[[New York Sun]]'' that reform should involve a market-based method transferring health care tax benefits to individuals rather than employers as well as giving individuals extra tax credits to afford more coverage.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.nysun.com/opinion/competition-solves-health-care/72610/|publisher=''[[New York Sun]]''|title=Competition Solves Health Care|accessdate=September 27, 2009|author=[[Tom Coburn]]|date=March 10, 2008}}</ref>

==Movements==

The [[health freedom movement]] supports free choice in health care. The libertarian [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] argues in favor of deregulation of the medical profession and health care sector.<ref>[http://www.mises.org/story/1749 How Medical Boards Nationalized Health Care - Henry Jones - Mises Institute<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some activists are politically left-wing, whilst the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] congressman and 2008 U.S. presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]], who supports a free-market health care system,<ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/politics/2008/bios/view.bg?articleid=1063101 Ron Paul candidate platform, The Boston Herald] Published 27 December 2007.
