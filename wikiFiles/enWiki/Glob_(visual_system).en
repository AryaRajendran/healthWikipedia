'''Globs''' are millimeter-sized color modules  found beyond the [[Visual cortex|visual area V2]] in the [[brain]]'s color processing [[Two Streams hypothesis|ventral]] (also known as parvocellular) pathway. They are scattered throughout the posterior [[inferior temporal cortex]] in an area called the [[Visual cortex|V4 complex]]. They are clustered by color preference, and organized as color [[Cortical column|column]]s. They are the first part of the brain in which color is processed in terms of the full range of [[hue]]s found in [[color space]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The term "glob" was proposed by [[Bevil Conway|Bevil R. Conway]] and Doris Y. Tsao<ref name="Conway07">Conway BR, Moeller S, Tsao DY. (2007). Specialized color modules in macaque extrastriate cortex.

==Properties==
Globs are found in the V4 complex, an area in the inferior temporal cortex, forward of area V3, that includes areas V4, the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] part of the posterior inferior temporal cortex and the rear part of the inferior temporal near the occipital lobe called TEO. Their neurons are not restricted to a single color preference. Neurons in adjacent glob cells  have similar color tuning and form clusters that are arranged spatially within the cortex.<ref name="Conway"/> In between them are ‘‘interglob’’ ares that were not color sensitive but respond to shape.<ref name="Conway07"/>  

The color-tuned neurons are arranged in color columns that are of a finer scale than single globs. These columns are between 50 and 100 μm in size. Color preferences of neurons recorded sequentially along given columns are arranged according to a chromotopic map that reflects perceptual [[color space]].<ref name="Conway"/> 

They are studied using [[functional MRI]]<ref name="Conway07"/> and [[single-unit recording]].<ref name="Conway"/>

==Color perception==
{{Main|Color vision}}
Three types of retinal [[Cone cell|cone]] create signals that get transformed in the visual pathway to create the perception of color.<ref name="Conway"/><ref>Conway BR. (2009). Color vision, cones, and color-coding in the cortex. Neuroscientist. 15(3):274-90. PMID 19436076</ref> However the neurons processing them in the [[retina]], [[lateral geniculate nucleus]], and V1 and V2 early parts of the visual cortex  encode using the [[opponent process]] only a limited range of colors that does not reflect the dimensions of perceptual color space.<ref>

PMID 11306629</ref> It is only the next area where globs are found that along the visual processing hierarchy, show [[hue]] sensitivity, with the population of
neurons representing most (if not all) of perceptual color space and which the color
responses of neurons correspond to perception.<ref name="Conway07"/><ref name="Conway"/>
