A '''food allergy''' is an adverse [[Immune system|immune response]] to a food protein.<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.foodallergy.org/questions.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=[[Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network]]}}</ref><ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.revolutionhealth.com/conditions/asthma-allergies/hay-fever-seasonal-allergies/introduction/allergy-glossary |title=Allergy Glossary of Terms |publisher=Revolution Health}}</ref>  They are distinct from other adverse responses to food, such as [[food intolerance]], pharmacological reactions, and toxin-mediated reactions.

The protein in the food is the most common [[allergy|allergic]] component.  These kinds of allergies occur when the body's immune system mistakenly identifies a protein as harmful.   Some proteins or fragments of proteins are resistant to [[digestion]] and those that are not broken down in the digestive process are tagged by the [[Immunoglobulin E]] (IgE). These tags fool the immune system into thinking that the protein is is an invader. The immune system, thinking the organism (the individual) is under attack, sends [[white blood cells]] to attack, and that triggers an allergic reaction.  These reactions can range from mild to severe. Allergic responses include [[dermatitis]], [[gastrointestinal]] and respiratory distress, including such life-threatening [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic]] responses as [[Anaphylaxis#Biphasic anaphylaxis|biphasic anaphylaxis]] and [[vasodilation]]; these require immediate emergency intervention.
Individuals with protein allergies commonly avoid contact with the problematic protein.  Some medications may prevent, minimize or treat protein allergy reactions. There is no cure.

Treatment consists of either [[immunotherapy]] (desensitisation) or avoidance, in which the allergic person avoids all forms of contact with the food to which they are allergic.  Areas of research include anti-IgE antibody (omalizumab, or Xolair) and specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI), which have shown some promise for treatment of certain food allergies. People diagnosed with a food allergy may carry an injectable form of [[epinephrine]] such as an [[EpiPen]], or wear some form of [[medical alert jewelry]], or develop an emergency action plan, in accordance with their doctor.

The scope of the problem, particularly for young people, is a significant public health issue.

==Classification==

Food allergy is thought to develop more easily in patients with the [[atopic syndrome]], a very common combination of diseases: [[allergic rhinitis]] and [[allergic conjunctivitis|conjunctivitis]], [[eczema]] and [[asthma]].<ref>{{cite web
 |url=http://www.icd9data.com/2007/Volume1/680-709/690-698/691/691.8.htm
 |work=ICD9
 |title=Other atopic dermatitis and related conditions
}}</ref> The syndrome has a strong inherited component; a family history of allergic diseases can be indicative of the atopic syndrome.

Conditions caused by food allergies are classified into 3 groups according to the mechanism of the allergic response:

'''1. IgE-mediated (classic):'''
*Type-I immediate hypersensitivity reaction (symptoms described above)
*[[Oral allergy syndrome]]

'''2. IgE and/or non-IgE-mediated:'''
*Allergic [[eosinophil]]ic [[esophagitis]]
*Allergic eosinophilic [[gastritis]]
*Allergic eosinophilic [[gastroenteritis]]

'''3. Non-IgE mediated:'''
*Food protein-induced [[Enterocolitis]] syndrome ([[FPIES]])
*Food protein proctocolitis/[[proctitis]]
*Food protein-induced enteropathy. An important example is [[Celiac disease]], which is an adverse immune response to the protein gluten.
*Milk-soy protein intolerance (MSPI) is a non-IgE mediated allergic response to milk and/or soy protein during infancy and early childhood. Symptoms of MSPI are usually attributable to food protein proctocolitis or FPIES.
*Heiner syndrome — lung disease due to formation of milk protein/IgG antibody immune complexes (milk precipitins) in the blood stream after it is absorbed from the GI tract. The lung disease commonly causes bleeding into the lungs and results in pulmonary hemosiderosis.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Image:Hives on back.jpg|thumb|Hives on the back are a common allergy symptom.]]
Classic immunoglobulin-E ([[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]])-mediated food allergies are classified as type-I immediate Hypersensitivity reaction. These allergic reactions have an acute onset (from seconds to one hour) and may include:<ref name="medlineplus">{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000817|Food allergy}}</ref>
*[[Hives]]<ref name="medlineplus" />
*Itching of mouth, lips, tongue, throat, eyes, skin, or other areas<ref name="medlineplus" />
*Swelling ([[angioedema]]) of lips, tongue, eyelids, or the whole face<ref name="medlineplus" />
*Difficulty swallowing<ref name="medlineplus" />
*Runny or congested nose<ref name="medlineplus" />
*Hoarse voice<ref name="medlineplus" />
*[[Wheezing]] and/or shortness of breath<ref name="medlineplus" />
*Nausea<ref name="medlineplus" />
*Vomiting<ref name="medlineplus" />
*Abdominal pain and/or stomach cramps<ref name="medlineplus" />
*Lightheadedness<ref name="medlineplus" />
*Fainting<ref name="medlineplus" />
Symptoms of allergies vary from person to person.  The amount of food needed to trigger a reaction also varies from person to person.

===Cardiopulmonary===
Serious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected. The latter can be indicated through wheezing and [[cyanosis]]. Poor blood circulation leads to a weak [[pulse]], pale skin, and [[fainting]].<ref>van Ree 1</ref>

A severe case of an allergic reaction, caused by symptoms affecting the respiratory tract and blood circulation, is called [[anaphylaxis]].  When symptoms are shown where breathing is impaired and circulation is affected, the person is said to be in [[anaphylactic shock]]. Anaphylaxis occurs when [[IgE Antibodies]] are involved, and areas of the body that are not in direct contact with the food become affected and show symptoms.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=12}}</ref>  This occurs because no nutrients are circulated throughout the body, causing the widening of [[blood vessels]].  This vasodilation causes [[blood pressure]] to decrease, which leads to the loss of [[consciousness]].    Those with [[asthma]] or an allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, or seafood are at greater risk for anaphylaxis.<ref>[http://www.foodallergyinitiative.org Food Allergies]. Food Allergy Initiative. 2009.  Accessed 27 Mar 2010.</ref>

==Common Allergies==
One of the most common food allergies is a sensitivity to peanuts, a member of the [[bean]] family.  Peanut allergies may be severe, but children with peanut allergies sometimes outgrow them.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=62}}</ref>  [[Nut (fruit)|Tree nuts]], including [[pecans]], [[pistachios]], [[pine nuts]], [[coconuts]], and [[walnuts]], are also common allergens.  Sufferers may be sensitive to one particular tree nut or to many different tree nuts.<ref name="Sicherer 63">{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=63}}</ref>  Also [[seeds]], including [[sesame seeds]] and [[poppy seeds]], contain oils where protein is present, which may elicit an allergic reaction.<ref name="Sicherer 63"/>

Egg allergies affect about one in fifty children but are frequently outgrown by children when they reach age five.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Savage JH, Matsui EC, Skripak JM, Wood RA |title=The natural history of egg allergy |journal=J Allergy Clin Immunol |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=1413–7 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18073126 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091-6749(07)01834-9 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.09.040}}</ref>  Typically the sensitivity is to proteins in the white, rather than the yolk.<ref name="Sicherer 63"/>

Milk, from cows, goats or sheep, is another common food allergen, and many sufferers are also unable to tolerate dairy products such as cheese.  A very small portion of children with a milk allergy, roughly ten percent, will have a reaction to [[beef]]. Beef contains a small amount of protein that is present in cow's milk.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=64}}</ref>

Other foods containing allergenic proteins include soy, wheat, fish, shellfish, fruits, vegetables, [[Corn allergy|maize]], spices, synthetic and natural colors, and chemical additives.

Although sensitivity levels vary by country, the most common food allergies are allergies to [[milk allergy|milk]], [[egg allergy|eggs]], [[peanut allergy|peanuts]], [[tree nut allergy|tree nuts]], [[Seafood allergy|seafood]], [[shellfish allergy|shellfish]], [[soy allergy|soy]] and [[wheat allergy|wheat]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&sub=30 |title=Food Allergy Facts & Figures  |date=March 28, 2007|publisher=Asthma and Allergy Foundation of Americs |quote= }}</ref> {{Clarify|date=April 2010}}  These are often referred to as "the big eight."<ref>

}}</ref> There are infant formulas in which the milk and [[soy protein]]s are degraded so when taken by an [[infant]], their [[immune system]] does not recognize the [[allergen]] and they can safely consume the product. Hypoallergenic infant formulas can be based on hydrolyzed proteins, which are proteins partially predigested in a less antigenic form. Other formulas, based on free amino acids, are the least antigenic and provide complete nutrition support in severe forms of [[milk allergy]].

People with latex allergy often also develop allergies to bananas, kiwi, avocados, and some other foods.<ref>

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Allergy}}
[[image:Histamin - Histamine.svg|thumb|A histamine, the structure shown, is what causes a person to feel itchy during an allergic reaction. A common medication to stop this is an antihistamine, which fights the histamines in the person's system.]]
[[Allergic reactions]] are hyperactive responses of the immune system to generally innocuous substances. When immune cells encounter the allergenic protein, IgE antibodies are produced; this is similar to the immune system's reaction to foreign [[pathogen]]s. The IgE antibodies identify the allergenic proteins as harmful and initiate the allergic reaction. The harmful proteins are those that do not break down due to the strong bonds of the protein. IgE antibodies bind to a receptor on the on the surface of the protein, creating a tag, just as a virus or parasite becomes tagged.  It is not entirely clear why some proteins do not denature and subsequently trigger allergic reactions and hypersensitivity while others do not.<ref>Food Reactions. [http://www.foodreactions.org/allergy/ Allergies]. Foodreactions.org.  Kent, England. 2005. Accessed 27 Apr 2010.</ref>

Hypersensitivities are categorized according to the parts of the immune system that are attacked and the amount of time it takes for the response to occur.  There are four types of [[Hypersensitivity reaction]]:  Type 1, Immediate IgE-mediated, Type 2, Cytotoxic, Type 3, Immune complex-mediated, and Type 4, Delayed cell-mediated.<ref>{{harvnb|Nester|2009|p=414}}</ref> The [[pathophysiology]] of allergic responses can be divided into two phases. The first is an [[Acute (medical)|acute response]] that occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen. This phase can either subside or progress into a "late phase reaction" which can substantially prolong the symptoms of a response, and result in tissue damage.

Many food allergies are caused by hypersensitivities to particular proteins in different foods.  Proteins have unique properties that allow them to become allergens, such as stabilizing forces in the tertiary and quaternary structure which prevent degradation during digestion. Many theoretically allergenic proteins cannot survive the destructive environment of the digestive tract and thus don't trigger hypersensitive reactions.<ref>Mayo Clinic. [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-allergy/AN00179 Causes of Food Allergies.] April 2010.</ref>

===Acute response===
[[Image:Allergy degranulation processes 01.svg|thumb|Degranulation process in allergy.<br/>'''1''' — antigen<br/>'''2''' — IgE antibody<br/>'''3''' — FcεRI receptor<br/>'''4''' — preformed mediators (histamine, proteases, chemokines, heparine)<br/>'''5''' — [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]]<br/>'''6''' — [[mast cell]]<br/>'''7''' — newly formed mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, PAF)]]
In the early stages of allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction against an allergen, encountered for the first time, causes a response in a type of immune cell called a [[T helper cell|T<sub>H</sub>2 lymphocyte]], which belongs to a subset of [[T cell]]s that produce a [[cytokine]] called [[interleukin-4]] (IL-4).  These T<sub>H</sub>2 cells interact with other [[lymphocytes]] called [[B cell]]s, whose role is the production of antibodies.  Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE.  Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of [[Fc receptor]] called [[FcεRI]]) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called [[mast cell]]s and [[basophil]]s, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response.  The IgE-coated cells, at this stage are sensitized to the allergen.<ref name=Janeway>{{cite book | last = Janeway | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Janeway | coauthors = Paul Travers, Mark Walport, and Mark Shlomchik | title = Immunobiology; Fifth Edition | publisher = Garland Science | year=  2001 | location = New York and London| pages = e-book | url =http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10| doi =  | isbn = 0-8153-4101-6}}.</ref>

If later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils.  Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule, and activates the sensitized cell.  Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called [[degranulation]], during which they release [[histamine]] and other inflammatory chemical mediators ([[cytokine]]s, [[interleukin]]s, [[leukotriene]]s, and [[prostaglandin]]s) from their [[Granule (cell biology)|granule]]s into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as [[vasodilation]], [[Mucous membrane|mucous]] secretion, [[nerve]] stimulation and [[smooth muscle]] contraction. This results in [[rhinorrhea]], itchiness, [[dyspnea]], and [[anaphylaxis]]. Depending on the individual, the allergen, and the mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems; asthma is localized to the respiratory system and eczema is localized to the [[dermis]].<ref name=Janeway/>

===Late-phase response===
After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late phase responses can often occur. This is due to the migration of other [[leukocyte]]s such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[lymphocyte]]s, [[eosinophil]]s, and [[macrophage]]s to the initial site. The reaction is usually seen 2–24 hours after the original reaction.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Grimbaldeston MA, Metz M, Yu M, Tsai M, Galli SJ |title=Effector and potential immunoregulatory roles of mast cells in IgE-associated acquired immune responses|journal=Curr. Opin. Immunol. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=751–60 |year=2006 |pmid=17011762 |doi=10.1016/j.coi.2006.09.011}}</ref> Cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in the persistence of long-term effects. Late phase responses seen in [[asthma]] are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses, although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils, and are still dependent on activity of T<sub>H</sub>2 cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holt PG, Sly PD |title=Th2 cytokines in the asthma late-phase response |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9596 |pages=1396–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17950849 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61587-6}}</ref>

===Protein structure and organization===
{{Main|Protein structure}}
Proteins are composed of [[amino acid]] monomers linked by [[peptide bond]]s.<ref name="Freeman 53">{{harvnb|Freeman|2008|p=53}}</ref>  The higher order structure of a protein depends on the sequence of amino acids which form its primary sequence, as various non-covalent interactions between these amino acids ensure proper protein folding. Proteins have specific amino acid sequences, which all identical proteins share.<ref>{{harvnb|Alberts|2010|p=121}}</ref>

A protein's [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] is created by hydrogen-bond interactions between the amide and [[carboxyl group]]s of the amino acid backbone. Secondary structure includes the formation of [[alpha helices]] and [[beta sheets]].<ref name="Freeman 53"/> The [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] is the overall shape of the protein, and is usually driven by the protein's tendency to orient hydrophobic amino acid side chains internally, although [[hydrogen bonding]], [[ionic interaction]]s and [[disulfide]] bonds also help to stabilize proteins in the tertiary state <ref>{{harvnb|Freeman|2008|p=54}}</ref> [[Protein quaternary structure|Quaternary structure]] is the overall combination of polypeptide subunits to form the functional unit.

===Protein function===
{{Main|Protein folding}}
Protein folding is essential to the overall function of the individual protein; some protein structures allow them to resist degradation in the acidic environment of the digestive tract.Polypeptide chains are often very long and flexible, which leads to a wide variety of ways for a protein to fold. Non-covalent interactions control the shape and structure of the nascent protein. A protein's proper [[proteinogenic amino acid|amino acid]] sequence is absolutely required to induce proper folding into the quaternary structure.  Two common folding patterns seen in proteins are the [[alpha helix]] and [[beta sheets]].

== Diagnosis ==
There are three common types of allergy testing:  [[skin prick test]], [[blood test]], and [[food challenge]]s.  An [[allergist]] can perform these tests, and they can also go into further depth depending on the results.
[[Image:Allergy skin testing.JPG|thumb|Skin testing on arm is a common way for detecting an allergy, however, it is not as effective as other tests.]]
*For skin prick tests, a tiny board with protruding needles is used.  The allergens are placed either on the board or directly on the skin.  The board is then placed on the skin, in order to puncture the skin and for the allergens to enter the body. If a hive appears, the person will be considered positive for the allergy. This test only works for IgE antibodies.  Allergic reactions caused by other antibodies cannot be detected through skin prick tests.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=185}}</ref>
*Blood testing is another way to test for [[allergies]]; however, it poses the same disadvantage and only detects IgE allergens and does not work for every possible allergen.  [[RAST test|RAST]], RadioAllergoSorbent Test, is used to detect IgE antibodies present to a certain allergen. The score taken from the RAST test is compared to predictive values, taken from a specific type of RAST test. If the score is higher than the predictive values, there is a great chance the allergy is present in the person. One advantage of this test is that it can test many allergens at one time.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|pp=187–8}}</ref>

*Food challenges test for allergens other than those caused by IgE allergens. The allergen is given to the person in the form of a pill, so the person can ingest the allergen directly.  The person is watched for signs and symptoms. The problem with food challenges is that they must be performed in the hospital under careful watch, due to the possibility of anaphylaxis.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=189}}</ref>

The best method for diagnosing food allergy is to be assessed by an allergist. The allergist will review the patient's history and the symptoms or reactions that have been noted after food ingestion. If the allergist feels the symptoms or reactions are consistent with food allergy, he/she will perform allergy tests.

Examples of allergy testing include:
* [[Skin prick test]]ing is easy to do and results are available in minutes. Different allergists may use different devices for skin prick testing. Some use a "[[bifurcated needle]]", which looks like a fork with 2 prongs. Others use a "multi-test", which may look like a small board with several pins sticking out of it. In these tests, a tiny amount of the suspected allergen is put onto the skin or into a testing device, and the device is placed on the skin to prick, or break through, the top layer of skin. This puts a small amount of the allergen under the skin. A hive will form at any spot where the person is allergic. This test generally yields a positive or negative result. It is good for quickly learning if a person is allergic to a particular food or not, because it detects allergic antibodies known as [[IgE]]. Skin tests cannot predict if a reaction would occur or what kind of reaction might occur if a person ingests that particular allergen. They can however confirm an allergy in light of a patient's history of reactions to a particular food. Non-IgE mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method.

* [[Blood tests]] are another useful diagnostic tool for evaluating IgE-mediated food allergies. For example, the [[RAST test|RAST]] (RadioAllergoSorbent Test) detects the presence of IgE antibodies to a particular allergen. A CAP-RAST test is a specific type of RAST test with greater specificity: it can show the amount of IgE present to each allergen.<ref>

}}</ref> Researchers have been able to determine "predictive values" for certain foods. These predictive values can be compared to the RAST blood test results. If a persons RAST score is higher than the predictive value for that food, then there is over a 95% chance the person will have an allergic reaction (limited to rash and anaphylaxis reactions) if they ingest that food. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Currently, predictive values are available for the following foods: milk, egg, peanut, fish, soy, and wheat.<ref>

*[[Elimination diet|Food challenges]], especially [[double-blind]] placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC), are the gold standard for diagnosis of food allergies, including most non-IgE mediated reactions. Blind food challenges involve packaging the suspected allergen into a capsule, giving it to the patient, and observing the patient for signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction. Due to the risk of [[anaphylaxis]], food challenges are usually conducted in a hospital environment in the presence of a doctor.

*Additional diagnostic tools for evaluation of eosinophilic or non-IgE mediated reactions include [[endoscopy]], [[colonoscopy]], and [[biopsy]].

===Differential diagnosis===
Important [[Differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]] are:
* [[Lactose intolerance]]; this generally develops later in life but can present in young patients in severe cases. This is due to an enzyme deficiency ([[lactase]]) and not allergy. It occurs in many non-Western people.
* [[Celiac disease]]; this is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten proteins such as [[gliadin]] (present in [[wheat]], rye and barley). It is a non-IgE mediated food allergy by definition.
* [[Irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS)
* [[angioedema|C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency]] (hereditary angioedema); this [[rare disease]] generally causes attacks of angioedema, but can present solely with [[abdominal pain]] and occasional diarrhea.

== Prevention ==
According to a report issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics, "There is evidence that breastfeeding for at least 4 months, compared with feeding infants formula made with intact cow milk protein, prevents or delays the occurrence of atopic dermatitis, cow milk allergy, and wheezing in early childhood."<ref>

In order to avoid an allergic reaction, a strict diet can be followed.  It is difficult to determine the amount of allergenic food required to elicit a reaction, so complete avoidance should be attempted unless otherwise suggested by a qualified medical professional.  In some cases, hypersensitive reactions can be triggered by exposures to allergens though skin contact, inhalation, kissing, participation in sports, [[blood transfusions]], cosmetics, and alcohol.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|pp=151–8}}</ref>

When avoiding certain foods in order to lessen the risk of reaction, it can be hard to maintain the proper amounts of nutrients.  Some allergens are also common sources of vitamins and minerals, as well as macronutrients such as [[fat]] and [[protein]]; healthcare providers will often suggest alternate food sources of essential vitamins and minerals which are less allergenic.

== Treatment ==

The mainstay of treatment for food allergy is avoidance of the foods that have been identified as allergens. For people who are extremely sensitive, this may involve the total avoidance of any exposure with the allergen, including touching or inhaling the problematic food as well as touching any surfaces that may have come into contact with it.

If the food is accidentally ingested and a systemic reaction ([[anaphylaxis]]) occurs, then [[epinephrine]] should be used. It is possible that a second dose of epinephrine may be required for severe reactions. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

There are treatments for an allergic reaction.  Among the first time the reaction occurs, it is most beneficial to take the person to the [[emergency room]], where proper action may be taken.  Other treatments include:  [[epinephrine]], [[antihistamines]], and [[steroids]].

===Epinephrine===
[[File:epipen.jpg|thumb|EpiPens are portable epinephrine-dispensing devices which can be used to alleviate the symptoms of severe, acute allergies.]] [[Epinephrine]], also known as adrenaline, is a common medication used to treat allergic reactions.  Epinephrine reverses the allergic reaction by improving blood circulation.  This is done by tightening blood vessels in order to increase the heart beat and circulation to bodily organs.  Epinephrine is produced naturally in the body.  It is produced during "flight-or-fight" response.  When a person is presented with a dangerous situation, the [[adrenal gland]] is triggered to release adrenaline; this gives the person an increased heart rate and more energy to try to fight off the danger being imposed on the individual.  Epinephrine is also prescribed by a physician in a form that is self-injectable.  This is what is called an [[epi-pen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=133}}</ref>

===Antihistamines===
[[Antihistamines]] are also used to treat allergic reactions.  Antihistamines block the action of [[histamine]], which causes blood vessels to dilate and become leaky to plasma proteins. Histamine also causes itchiness by acting on sensory nerve terminals.  The most common antihistamine given for food allergies is [[diphenhydramine]], also known as [[Benedryl]]. Antihistamines relieve symptoms. When it comes to dealing with [[anaphylaxis]], however, they do not completely improve the dangerous symptoms that affect breathing.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=131}}</ref>

===Steroids===
Steroids are used to calm down the [[immune system]] cells that are attacked by the chemicals released during an allergic reaction.  This form of treatment in the form of a [[nasal spray]] should not be used to treat anaphylaxis, for it only relieves symptoms in the area in which the steroid is in contact.  Another reason steroids should not be used to treat anaphylaxis is due to the long amount of time it takes to reduce [[inflammation]] and start to work.  Steroids can also be taken orally or through injection.  By taking a steroid in these manners, every part of the body can be reached and treated, but a long time is usually needed for these to take effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=134}}</ref>

===Desensitization, also known as, Oral Immunotherapy===
For food allergy, desensitization can be achieved through oral immunotherapy.<ref>

===Traditional Chinese Medicine===
As of early 2012, phase II clinical trials for human efficacy have gotten underway for a formula called FAHF-2 (food allergy herbal formula 2).  This formula is based on a long-used Traditional Chinese Medicine formula for parasite infection.  In early clinical trials, it has been found to completely block anaphylaxis in mouse models.

==Society and culture==
In response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain major allergens or by-products of major allergens.
