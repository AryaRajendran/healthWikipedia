[[File:Leriche's syndrome.jpg|thumb|175px|Leriche's syndrome (X-ray)]]
In [[medicine]], '''aortoiliac occlusive disease''', also known as '''Leriche's syndrome''' and '''Leriche syndrome''', is [[atherosclerotic]] occlusive disease involving the [[abdominal aorta]] and/or both of the [[iliac arteries]]{{dn|date=October 2012}}.

==Symptoms==
Classically, it is described in male patients as a triad of [[symptom]]s consisting of: 
#[[claudication]] of the buttocks and thighs
#absent or decreased femoral pulses
#[[impotence]]

This combination is known as Leriche syndrome.[http://onlinesurgicaldictionary.com/arteries/obliterative-atheromatous-disease/aortoiliac-disease]  However, any number of symptoms may present, depending on the distribution and severity of the disease, such as muscle atrophy and slow wound healing in the legs. 
Investigations:
Angiography (aortography)
Doppler

==Treatment==
* Kissing balloon angioplasty +/- stent
* [[aorta|Aorto]][[iliac artery|iliac]]{{dn|date=October 2012}} bypass graft
* [[axillary artery|Axillo]][[femoral artery|femoral]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee BY, Guerra J |title=Axillofemoral bypass graft in a spinal cord injured patient with impending gangrene |journal=The Journal of the American Paraplegia Society |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=171–6 |year=1994 |pmid=7869060 |doi=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=McKinsey JF |title=Extra-anatomic reconstruction |journal=Surg.

==Discovery==
The condition was first described by [[Robert Graham]]{{dn|date=October 2012}} in 1814, but the condition with its triad of symptoms was ascribed to [[René Leriche]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2747}}</ref> Leriche, a [[French people|French]] surgeon, linked the [[pathophysiology]] with the [[anatomy]] of the condition. John Hunter's dissections of atherosclerotic aortic bifurcations from the late 18th century are preserved at the [[Hunterian Museum]], but Leriche was first to publish on the subject based on a patient he treated with the condition at the age of 30. Following treatment the 30 year old was able to walk without pain<!--without pain??? --> and maintain an erection.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
