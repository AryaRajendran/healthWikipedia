'''Animal testing''', also known as '''animal experimentation''', '''animal research''', and '''[[in vivo]] testing''', is the use of non-human animals in experiments (although some research about animals involves only natural behaviors or pure observation, such as a mouse running a [[radial arm maze|maze]] or field studies of [[chimpanzee#Social structure|chimp troops]]). The research is conducted inside universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, farms, defense establishments, and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry.<ref name=selectcommintro>{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm#a7 |title="Introduction", Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures Report|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2012-07-13}}</ref> It includes pure research such as [[genetics]], [[developmental biology]], [[Ethology|behavioral studies]], as well as applied research such as [[biomedical research]], [[xenotransplantation]], drug testing and [[Toxicology testing|toxicology tests]], including [[Testing cosmetics on animals|cosmetics testing]]. Animals are also used for education, breeding, and defense research. The practice is regulated to various degrees in different countries.

Worldwide it is estimated that the number of [[vertebrate]] animals—from [[zebrafish]] to non-human [[primates]]—ranges from the tens of millions to more than 100 million used annually.<ref>Meredith Cohn (2010-08-26).

==Definitions==
The terms animal testing, '''animal experimentation''', animal research, '''''in vivo'' testing''', and '''[[vivisection]]''' have similar [[denotation]]s but different [[connotation]]s. Literally, "vivisection" means the "cutting up" of a living animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the [[dissection]] of live animals. The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals; for example, the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' defines "vivisection" as: "Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals",<ref name=croce>Croce, Pietro (1999). ''Vivisection or Science? An Investigation into Testing Drugs and Safeguarding Health''. Zed Books, ISBN 1856497321.</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382118?query=Vivisection&ct= "Vivisection"], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2007.</ref><ref name=buavfaq/> although dictionaries point out that the broader definition is "used only by people who are opposed to such work".<ref>Definitions in:
*[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O999-vivisection.html Oxford Pocket Dictionary]
*[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vivisection Merriam-Webster Dictionary]</ref> The word has a negative connotation, implying torture, suffering, and death.<ref name=Carbone22/> The word "vivisection" is preferred by those opposed to this research, whereas scientists typically use the term "animal experimentation".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Paixão |first1=RL |last2=Schramm |first2=FR |title=Ethics and animal experimentation: what is debated? |journal=Cadernos de saude publica / Ministerio da Saude, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Escola Nacional de Saude Publica |volume=15 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=99–110 |year=1999 |pmid=10089552}}</ref><ref>Yarri, Donna (2005).

Animals have been used repeatedly through the history of biomedical research.

[[Toxicology]] testing became important in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the U.S., the government could only ban a drug after a company had been prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, in response to the [[Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster]] of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SulfanilamideDisaster/default.htm |title=Taste of Raspberries, Taste of Death.

===Historical debate===
[[Image:Claude Bernard 5.jpg|left|thumb|[[Claude Bernard]], regarded as the "prince of vivisectors"<ref name=Croce11/> argued that experiments on animals are "entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man".<ref name=Bernard>[[Claude Bernard|Bernard, Claude]] ''An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine'', 1865. First English translation by Henry Copley Greene, published by Macmillan & Co., Ltd., 1927; reprinted in 1949, p. 125.</ref>]]
As the experimentation on animals increased, especially the practice of vivisection, so did criticism and controversy. In 1655, the advocate of [[Galen]]ic physiology [[Edmund O'Meara]] said that "the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state."<ref name=Ryder54>[[Richard D.

There were also objections on an [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethical]] basis, contending that the benefit to humans did not justify the harm to animals.<ref name=ANZCCART/> Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle — many people believed that animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans.<ref name=ANZCCART/>

On the other side of the debate, those in favor of animal testing held that experiments on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge. [[Claude Bernard]], known as the "prince of vivisectors"<ref name=Croce11>Croce, Pietro. ''Vivisection or Science? An Investigation into Testing Drugs and Safeguarding Health''.

In 1896, the physiologist and physician [[Walter Cannon|Dr. Walter B.

In 1822, the first [[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822|animal protection law]] was enacted in the British parliament, followed by the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1876|Cruelty to Animals Act (1876)]], the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by [[Charles Darwin]], who wrote to [[Ray Lankester]] in March 1871: "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree that it is justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Life-and-Letters-of-Charles-Darwinx29407.html |title='&#39;The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, Volume II'&#39; |publisher=Fullbooks.com }}</ref><ref>Bowlby, John (1991).

Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.<ref>Buettinger, Craig (1993-01-01) [http://web.archive.org/web/20080215121937/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-13506650.html Antivivisection and the charge of zoophil-psychosis in the early twentieth century.] ''The Historian''.</ref>

==Care and use of animals==
{{See also|Animal testing regulations|Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee|Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986}}

===Regulations===
The regulations that apply to animals in laboratories vary across species. In the U.S., under the provisions of the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] and the ''Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals'' (the ''Guide''), published by the National Academy of Sciences, any procedure can be performed on an animal if it can be successfully argued that it is scientifically justified. In general, researchers are required to consult with the institution's veterinarian and its [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]] (IACUC), which every research facility is obliged to maintain.<ref name=Carbone68>Carbone, pp. 68–69.</ref> The IACUC must ensure that alternatives, including non-animal alternatives, have been considered, that the experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative, and that pain relief is given unless it would interfere with the study. Larry Carbone, a laboratory animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously regardless of the species involved, though the use of [[non-human primates]] always raises what he calls a "red flag of special concern."<ref>Carbone, p. 94.</ref> A study published in ''Science'' magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the three-year study found that animal-use committees that do not know the specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal-use committees that do know the university and personnel. Specifically, blinded committees more often ask for more information rather than approving studies.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1061621}}</ref>

The IACUCs regulate all vertebrates in testing at institutions receiving federal funds in the USA. Although the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act do not include purpose-bred rodents and birds, these species are equally regulated under Public Health Service policies that govern the IACUCs.<ref>[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm#AnimalWelfareAssurance Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare].

Code of Federal Regulations. Vol. 1 (2008-01-01).</ref> Animal Welfare Act regulations are enforced by the USDA, whereas Public Health Service regulations are enforced by OLAW and in many cases by AAALAC.

In 1966, the Laboratory Animal Breeders Association estimated in testimony before Congress that the number of mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits used in 1965 was around 60 million. (Hearings before the Subcommittee on Livestock and Feed Grains, Committee on Agriculture, U.S. House of Representatives, 1966, p. 63.) In 2004, the Department of Agriculture listed 64,932 dogs, 23,640 cats, 54,998 non-human primates, 244,104 guinea pigs, 175,721 hamsters, 261,573 rabbits, 105,678 farm animals, and 171,312 other mammals, a total of 1,101,958, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2004 from 195,157 to 64,932, and from 66,165 to 23,640, respectively.

[[Image:Drosophila melanogaster - front (aka).jpg|thumb|[[Drosophila melanogaster|Fruit flies]] are commonly used.]]
Although many more invertebrates than vertebrates are used, these experiments are largely unregulated by law. The most used invertebrate species are ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', a fruit fly, and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a [[nematode]] worm.

Cats are most commonly used in neurological research. Over 25,500 cats were used in the U.S. in 2000, around half of whom were used in experiments which, according to the [[American Anti-Vivisection Society]], had the potential to cause "pain and/or distress".<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080308163109/http://www.aavs.org/images/winter2003_text.pdf Cat madness: human research using cats].

Dogs are widely used in biomedical research, testing, and education — particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2006 about 670,000 animals (57%) (not including rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) were used in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. About 420,000 (36%) were used in procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 84,000 (7%) were used in studies that would cause pain or distress that would not be relieved.<ref name=USDA2006/>

In the UK, research projects are classified as mild, moderate, and substantial in terms of the suffering the researchers conducting the study say they may cause; a fourth category of "unclassified" means the animal was [[Anesthesia|anesthetized]] and killed without recovering [[consciousness]], according to the researchers. In December 2001, 1,296 (39%) of project licenses in force were classified as mild, 1,811 (55%) as moderate, 63 (2%) as substantial, and 139 (4%) as unclassified.<ref name=RyderSinger>[[Richard D.

The defining text on animal welfare regulation, "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" defines the parameters that govern animal testing in the USA. It states "The ability to experience and respond to pain is widespread in the animal kingdom...Pain is a stressor and, if not relieved, can lead to unacceptable levels of stress and distress in animals."<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5140 "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals"], ILAR, National Research Council, National Academies Press, 1996, p. 64, ISBN 0309053773.</ref> The Guide states that the ability to recognize the symptoms of pain in different species is vital in efficiently applying pain relief and that it is essential for the people caring for and using animals to be entirely familiar with these symptoms. On the subject of analgesics used to relieve pain, the Guide states "The selection of the most appropriate analgesic or anesthetic should reflect professional judgment as to which best meets clinical and humane requirements without compromising the scientific aspects of the research protocol". Accordingly, all issues of animal pain and distress, and their potential treatment with analgesia and anesthesia, are required regulatory issues in receiving animal protocol approval.

Regulations require that scientists use as few animals as possible, especially for terminal experiments.<ref name=Flecknell/> However, while policy makers consider suffering to be the central issue and see animal euthanasia as a way to reduce suffering, others, such as the [[RSPCA]], argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value.<ref>[http://www.apc.gov.uk/reference/costbenefit.pdf Animal Procedures Committee: review of cost-benefit assessment in the use of animals in research] The Animal Procedures Committee, June 2003 p46-7</ref> Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause [[pain]] and [[suffering]], not whether their death is undesirable in itself.<ref name=Carbone2>Carbone, Larry.

Methods of euthanizing laboratory animals are chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5140 "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals"], ILAR, National Research Council, National Academies Press, 1996, p. 65, ISBN 0309053773.</ref> The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal can be made to inhale a gas, such as [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]], by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. [[Sedative]]s or [[anesthetic]]s such as [[barbiturate]]s can be given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]], or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as [[tricaine]]. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include [[decapitation]] (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. [[Cervical dislocation]] (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. [[Maceration (food)|Maceration]] (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave [[irradiation]] of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. [[Captive bolt]]s may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. [[electric shock|Electrocution]] may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. [[Pithing]] (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing [[air embolism]] are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avma.org/resources/euthanasia.pdf |title=AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia, June 2007 edition, Report of the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia |publisher=Avma.org }}</ref><!--add subsections on cage sizes; use versus care-->

===Pure research===
Basic or pure research investigates how organisms behave, develop, and function. Those opposed to animal testing object that pure research may have little or no practical purpose, but researchers argue that it may produce unforeseen benefits, rendering the distinction between pure and applied research—research that has a specific practical aim—unclear.<ref name=Lords3>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15006.htm "Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures Report"], House of Lords, July 16, 2002. See chapter 3: "The purpose and nature of animal experiments." Retrieved July 6, 2010.</ref> Pure research uses larger numbers and a greater variety of animals than applied research. Fruit flies, nematode worms, mice and rats together account for the vast majority, though small numbers of other species are used, ranging from [[California sea slug|sea slugs]] through to [[armadillo]]s.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |last1=Job |first1=CK |title=Nine-banded armadillo and leprosy research |journal=Indian journal of pathology & microbiology |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=541–50 |year=2003 |pmid=15025339}}</ref> Examples of the types of animals and experiments used in basic research include:

Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their [[ecological niche|niche]]) produce [[adaptation]]s in their physiology and [[Comparative anatomy|morphology]].

===Applied research===
Applied research aims to solve specific and practical problems. Compared to pure research, which is largely academic in origin, applied research is usually carried out in the [[pharmaceutical industry]], or by universities in commercial partnerships. These may involve the use of [[animal model]]s of diseases or conditions, which are often discovered or generated by pure research programmes. In turn, such applied studies may be an early stage in the [[drug discovery]] process. Examples include:

*[[Genetic modification]] of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific conditions such as [[single gene disorders]], such as [[Huntington's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramaswamy |first1=S |last2=McBride |first2=JL |last3=Kordower |first3=JH |title=Animal models of Huntington's disease |journal=ILAR journal / National Research Council, Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=356–73 |year=2007 |pmid=17712222}}</ref> Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rees |first1=DA |last2=Alcolado |first2=JC |title=Animal models of diabetes mellitus |journal=Diabetic Medicine |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=359–70 |year=2005 |pmid=15787657 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-5491.2005.01499.x}}</ref> or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Iwakuma |first1=T |last2=Lozano |first2=G |title=Crippling p53 activities via knock-in mutations in mouse models |journal=Oncogene |volume=26 |issue=15 |pages=2177–84 |year=2007 |pmid=17401426 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1210278}}</ref> These models allow investigations on how and why the disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Frese |first1=KK |last2=Tuveson |first2=DA |title=Maximizing mouse cancer models |journal=Nature reviews.

*Studies on models of naturally occurring disease and condition. Certain domestic and wild animals have a natural propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans. Cats are used as a model to develop immunodeficiency virus vaccines and to study [[leukemia]] because their natural predisposition to [[FIV]] and [[Feline leukemia virus]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dunham |first1=SP |title=Lessons from the cat: development of vaccines against lentiviruses |journal=Veterinary immunology and immunopathology |volume=112 |issue=1–2 |pages=67–77 |year=2006 |pmid=16678276 |doi=10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.03.013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vail |first1=DM |last2=MacEwen |first2=EG |title=Spontaneously occurring tumors of companion animals as models for human cancer |journal=Cancer investigation |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=781–92 |year=2000 |pmid=11107448 |doi=10.3109/07357900009012210}}</ref> Certain breeds of dog suffer from [[narcolepsy]] making them the major model used to study the human condition. [[Armadillo]]s and humans are among only a few animal species that naturally suffer from [[leprosy]]; as the bacteria responsible for this disease cannot yet be grown in culture, armadillos are the primary source of [[bacilli]] used in leprosy vaccines.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

*Studies on induced animal models of human diseases. Here, an animal is treated so that it develops [[pathology]] and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting blood flow to the brain to induce [[stroke]], or giving [[neurotoxin]]s that cause damage similar to that seen in [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name=Tolwani/> Such studies can be difficult to interpret, and it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pound |first1=P |last2=Ebrahim |first2=S |last3=Sandercock |first3=P |last4=Bracken |first4=MB |last5=Roberts |first5=I |author6=Reviewing Animal Trials Systematically (RATS) Group |title=Where is the evidence that animal research benefits humans? |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |volume=328 |issue=7438 |pages=514–7 |year=2004 |pmid=14988196 |pmc=351856 |doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7438.514}}</ref> For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection|BUAV]] argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology.<ref>Langley, Gill (2006) [http://www.buav.org/downloads/pdf/BUAV_Report-Next_of_Kin.pdf ''next of kin...A report on the use of primates in experiments''], BUAV.</ref> In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity ''The Parkinson's Appeal'', state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as [[pallidotomy]], new drug treatments such as [[levodopa]], and later [[deep brain stimulation]].<ref name=Emborg>{{cite journal |last1=Emborg |first1=ME |title=Nonhuman primate models of Parkinson's disease |journal=ILAR journal / National Research Council, Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=339–55 |year=2007 |pmid=17712221}}</ref><ref name=Tolwani>{{cite journal |last1=Tolwani |first1=RJ |last2=Jakowec |first2=MW |last3=Petzinger |first3=GM |last4=Green |first4=S |last5=Waggie |first5=K |title=Experimental models of Parkinson's disease: insights from many models |journal=Laboratory animal science |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=363–71 |year=1999 |pmid=10480640}}</ref><ref>[http://www.parkinsonsappeal.com/pdfs/The%20History%20of%20Deep%20Brain%20Stimulation.pdf The History of Deep Brain Stimulation]. parkinsonsappeal.com</ref>
*Animal testing has also included the use of [[placebo]] testing. In these cases animals are treated with a substance that produces no pharmacological effect, but is administered in order to determine any biological alterations due to the experience of a substance being administered, and the results are compared with those obtained with an active compound.

===Toxicology testing===
{{Main|Toxicology testing}}
{{Further|Draize test|LD50|Acute toxicity|Chronic toxicity}}

Toxicology testing, also known as safety testing, is conducted by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]], on behalf of a wide variety of customers.<ref name=BUAVHPT>[http://www.buav.org/pdf/HouseholdProductTests.pdf Household Product Tests] [[BUAV]]</ref> According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures.<ref name=EU2005>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080216072132/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/pdf/5th_stat_rep_lab_animals_en.pdf Fifth Report on the Statistics on the Number of Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes in the Member States of the European Union], ''Commission of the European Communities'', published November 2007</ref> According to ''Nature'', 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides.<ref name=Abbott>{{cite journal|author=Abbott, Alison|pmid=16281001|url=http://ethics.ucsd.edu/journal/2006/readings/Animal_Testing_More_than_a_cosmetic_change.pdf|title=Animal testing: More than a cosmetic change|journal=Nature|volume= 438|pages= 144–146|year=2005|doi=10.1038/438144a|issue=7065}}</ref> The tests are conducted without [[anesthesia]], because [[drug interaction|interactions between drugs]] can affect how animals [[xenobiotic metabolism|detoxify]] chemicals, and may interfere with the results.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Watkins J |first1=3rd |title=Exposure of rats to inhalational anesthetics alters the hepatobiliary clearance of cholephilic xenobiotics |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=250 |issue=2 |pages=421–7 |year=1989 |pmid=2760837}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Watt |first1=JA |last2=Dickinson |first2=RG |title=The effect of diethyl ether, pentobarbitone and urethane anaesthesia on diflunisal conjugation and disposition in rats |journal=Xenobiotica |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=289–301 |year=1990 |pmid=2336839 |doi=10.3109/00498259009046848}}</ref>
[[Image:DraizeTest-PETA.jpg|thumb|A rabbit during a [[Draize test]]]]
Toxicology tests are used to examine finished products such as [[pesticide]]s, [[medication]]s, [[food additives]], packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients. Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than finished products, but according to [[BUAV]], manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances; they therefore repeat the tests using their finished products to obtain a less toxic label.<ref name=BUAVHPT/>

The substances are applied to the skin or dripped into the eyes; injected [[intravenous]]ly, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[subcutaneous]]ly; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or simply in the animal's food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There are several different types of [[acute toxicity]] tests. The {{LD50}} ("Lethal Dose 50%") test is used to evaluate the toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill 50% of the test animal [[Statistical population|population]]. This test was removed from [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] international guidelines in 2002, replaced by methods such as the [[Fixed Dose Procedure|fixed dose procedure]], which use fewer animals and cause less suffering.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walum |first1=E |title=Acute oral toxicity |journal=Environmental health perspectives |volume=106 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=497–503 |year=1998 |pmid=9599698 |pmc=1533392 |doi=10.2307/3433801}}</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20081119080934/http://hsus.org/animals_in_research/animals_in_research_news/intergovernmental_organization_eliminates_the_ld50_test.html Inter-Governmental Organization Eliminates the LD50 Test], The Humane Society of the United States (2003-02-05)</ref> Abbott writes that, as of 2005, "the LD50 acute toxicity test ... still accounts for one-third of all animal [toxicity] tests worldwide."<ref name=Abbott/>

Irritancy can be measured using the [[Draize test]], where a test substance is applied to an animal's eyes or skin, usually an albino rabbit. For Draize eye testing, the test involves observing the effects of the substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation, but the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows "continuing signs of severe pain or distress".<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080227041440/http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/9740501E.PDF OECD guideline 405, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development].</ref> The [[Humane Society of the United States]] writes that the procedure can cause redness, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or even blindness.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090203060123/http://hsus.org/animals_in_research/species_used_in_research/rabbit.html Species Used in Research: Rabbit], Humane Society of the United States</ref> This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate, subjective, over-sensitive, and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wilhelmus |first1=KR |title=The Draize eye test |journal=Survey of ophthalmology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=493–515 |year=2001 |pmid=11425356 |doi=10.1016/S0039-6257(01)00211-9}}</ref> Although no accepted ''in vitro'' alternatives exist, a modified form of the Draize test called the ''low volume eye test'' may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results and this was adopted as the new standard in September 2009.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Secchi |first1=A |last2=Deligianni |first2=V |title=Ocular toxicology: the Draize eye test |journal=Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=367–72 |year=2006 |pmid=16954791 |doi=10.1097/01.all.0000244798.26110.00}}</ref><ref name=Hadwen>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100327195524/http://www.drhadwentrust.org/news/rabbit-eye-test-replacement Draize rabbit eye test replacement milestone welcomed]. ''Dr Hadwen Trust'' (2009-09-21)</ref> However, the Draize test will still be used for substances that are not severe irritants.<ref name=Hadwen/>

The most stringent tests are reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting less than a month (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, [[mutagen]]icity, [[carcinogen]]icity, [[teratogen]]icity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.

These toxicity tests provide, in the words of a 2006 [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] report, "critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential".<ref>[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11523&page=R1 Toxicity Testing for Assessment of Environmental Agents"] National Academies Press, (2006), p. 21.</ref> ''Nature'' reported that most animal tests either over- or underestimate risk, or do not reflect toxicity in humans particularly well,<ref name=Abbott/> with [[false positive]] results being a particular problem.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hartung T |title=Toxicology for the twenty-first century |journal=Nature |volume=460 |issue=7252 |pages=208–12 |year=2009 |pmid=19587762 |doi=10.1038/460208a|bibcode = 2009Natur.460..208H }}</ref> This variability stems from using the effects of high doses of chemicals in small numbers of laboratory animals to try to predict the effects of low doses in large numbers of humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Smith LL |title=Key challenges for toxicologists in the 21st century |journal=Trends Pharmacol.

====Cosmetics testing====
{{Main|Testing cosmetics on animals}}
[[Image:NoAnimalTesting.png|left|thumb|Products in Europe not tested on animals carry this symbol.]]
Cosmetics testing on animals is particularly controversial. Such tests, which are still conducted in the U.S., involve general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, [[phototoxic]]ity (toxicity triggered by [[ultraviolet]] light) and mutagenicity.<ref>Stephens, Martin & Rowan, Andrew. [http://web.archive.org/web/20080308163106/http://www.hsus.org/web-files/PDF/ARI/ARIS_An_Overview_Of_Animal_Testing_Issues.pdf An overview of Animal Testing Issues, Humane Society of the United States]</ref>

Cosmetics testing is banned in the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK, and in 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union (EU) agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the EU from 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, [[L'Oreal]], has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the [[European Court of Justice]] in [[Luxembourg]], asking that the ban be quashed.<ref name=Osborn/> The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy.<ref name=Osborn>Osborn, Andrew & Gentleman, Amelia.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/animalrights/story/0,11917,1021527,00.html "Secret French move to block animal-testing ban"], ''The Guardian'' (2003-08-19).

===Drug testing===
[[Image:Dogs6CCcopy.jpg|thumb|Beagles used for safety testing of [[pharmaceuticals]] in a British facility]]
Before the early 20th century, laws regulating drugs were lax. Currently, all new pharmaceuticals undergo rigorous animal testing before being licensed for human use. Tests on pharmaceutical products involve:
*''metabolic tests'', investigating [[pharmacokinetics]]&nbsp;– how drugs are absorbed, [[Drug metabolism|metabolized]] and [[Excretion|excreted]] by the body when introduced [[Wiktionary:oral|orally]], [[intravenous]]ly, intraperitoneally, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[Transdermal patch|transdermally]].
*''toxicology tests'', which gauge [[acute toxicity|acute]], sub-acute, and [[chronic toxicity]]. Acute toxicity is studied by using a rising dose until signs of toxicity become apparent. Current European legislation demands that "acute toxicity tests must be carried out in two or more mammalian species" covering "at least two different routes of administration".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:HTML |title=EU Directive 2001/83/EC, p. 44 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> Sub-acute toxicity is where the drug is given to the animals for four to six weeks in doses below the level at which it causes rapid poisoning, in order to discover if any toxic [[drug metabolism|drug metabolites]] build up over time. Testing for chronic toxicity can last up to two years and, in the European Union, is required to involve two species of mammals, one of which must be non-rodent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:HTML |title=EU Directive 2001/83/EC, p. 45 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu }}</ref>
*''efficacy studies'', which test whether experimental drugs work by inducing the appropriate illness in animals. The drug is then administered in a [[Randomized controlled trial|double-blind controlled trial]], which allows researchers to determine the effect of the drug and the [[Dose response|dose-response]] curve.
*Specific tests on ''reproductive function'', ''embryonic toxicity'', or ''carcinogenic potential'' can all be required by law, depending on the result of other studies and the type of drug being tested.

===Education, breeding, and defense===
Animals are also used for [[education]] and training; are bred for use in laboratories; and are used by the military to develop weapons, vaccines, battlefield surgical techniques, and defensive clothing.<ref name=Lords3/> For example, in 2008 the United States [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] used live pigs to study the effects of [[improvised explosive device]] explosions on internal organs, especially the brain.<ref>Brook, Tom Vanden, "[http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20090407/1apigs07_st.art.htm Brain Study, Animal Rights Collide]", ''[[USA Today]]'' (2009-04-07), p. 1.</ref>

In the US military, [[goat]]s are commonly used to train [[combat medic]]s. (Goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after the Pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the 1980s.<ref name=kelly2013>{{citation

|first=Jon|last=Kelly|periodical= BBC News Magazine|date=2013-03-07

Besides the US, six other NATO countries, including Poland and Denmark, use live animals for combat medic training.<ref name=kelly2013/>

There are efforts in many countries to find alternatives to using animals in education.<ref>Dalal, Rooshin et al. [http://www.pcrm.org/resch/anexp/abstract_teaching.html ''Replacement Alternatives in Education: Animal-Free Teaching''] abstract from Fifth World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences, Berlin, August 2005.</ref> Horst Spielmann, German director of the Central Office for Collecting and Assessing Alternatives to Animal Experimentation, while describing Germany's progress in this area, told German broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] in 2005: "Using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous. In many countries, one can become a doctor, vet or biologist without ever having performed an experiment on an animal."<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1687760,00.html ''Seeking an End to Animal Experimentation''], [[Deutsche Welle]] (2005-08-23).

[[File:実験動物慰霊碑.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument for animals used in testing at [[Keio University]]]]
The ethical questions raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to much debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rollin |first1=Bernard E. |title=The Regulation of Animal Research and the Emergence of Animal Ethics: A Conceptual History |journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics |volume=27 |pages=285–304 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s11017-006-9007-8 | pmid=16937023 |issue=4}}</ref> There remain disagreements about which procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply to which species. The dominant ethical position worldwide is that achievement of scientific and medical goals using animal testing is desirable, so long as animal suffering and use is minimized.<ref name=1985Amend>{{cite web|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/pl99198.htm |title=1985 Amendment to Animal Welfare Act |publisher=Nal.usda.gov |accessdate=2012-07-13}}</ref> The British government has additionally required that the cost to animals in an experiment be weighed against the gain in knowledge.<ref name=SelectComm>{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15003.htm |title=Summary of House of Lords Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures |publisher=UK Parliament|date=2002-07-24 |accessdate=2012-07-13}}</ref> Some medical schools and agencies in China, Japan, and South Korea have built [[cenotaph]]s for killed animals.<ref>[http://rayinfo.koizumiengei.com/anilog/000145.html 韓国・食薬庁で「実験動物慰霊祭」挙行]</ref> In Japan there are also annual memorial services (''Ireisai'' 慰霊祭) for animals sacrificed at medical school.

A wide range of minority viewpoints exist. The view that animals have moral rights ([[animal rights]]) is a philosophical position proposed by [[Tom Regan]], among others, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires, and as such are the "subjects of a life" with moral value and therefore moral rights.<ref>Singer, Peter (ed.). "A Companion to Ethics". Blackwell Companions to Philosophy, 1991.</ref> Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a "moral dilemma" view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research.<ref name=Nuffield>[http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/sites/default/files/files/Animals%20Chapter%2014%20Discussion%20of%20Ethical%20Issues.pdf Page 244, Chapter 14, Discussion of ethical issues] in: [http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/animal-research The ethics of research involving animals] at the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Published 25 05 2005</ref> In contrast, an [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist view in animal rights]] holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal.<ref name=Nuffield/> [[Bernard Rollin]] argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Another prominent position is that of philosopher [[Peter Singer]], who argues that there are no grounds to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] moral considerations.<ref name=Rollin1998>Rollin, Bernard E. (1998) "The moral status of animals and their use as experimental subjects," in Kuhse, Helga and Singer, Peter (eds.). "A Companion to Bioethics". Blackwell Publishing, ISBN 063123019X.</ref>

Although these arguments have not been widely accepted, governments such as the Netherlands and New Zealand have responded to the concerns by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the [[great apes]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gagneux |first1=P |last2=Moore |first2=JJ |last3=Varki |first3=A |title=The ethics of research on great apes |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=27–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16136111 |doi=10.1038/437027a|bibcode = 2005Natur.437...27G }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vermij |first1=P |title=Europe's last research chimps to retire |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=9 |issue=8 |page=981 |year=2003 |pmid=12894144 |doi=10.1038/nm0803-981b}}</ref>

Concerns have been raised over the mistreatment of primates undergoing testing. In 1985 the case of [[Britches (monkey)|Britches]], a macaque monkey at the [[University of California, Riverside]], gained public attention.

===Threats to researchers===
In 2006, a primate researcher at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) shut down the experiments in his lab after threats from animal rights activists. The researcher had received a grant to use 30 [[macaque]] monkeys for vision experiments; each monkey was anesthetized for a single physiological experiment lasting up to 120 hours, and then euthanized.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Malone |first1=B.

Demonstrations were held in front of his home. A [[Molotov cocktail]] was placed on the porch of what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher; instead, it was accidentally left on the porch of an elderly woman unrelated to the university.

These attacks, as well as similar incidents that caused the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] to declare in 2002 that the animal rights movement had "clearly taken a turn toward the more extreme," this prompted the US government to pass the [[Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act]] and the UK government to add the offense of "Intimidation of persons connected with animal research organisation" to the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=When animal rights turns ugly |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=26 |pages=603–5 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/nbt0608-603 |issue=6 |pmid=18536673 |last1=Huggett |first1=B}}</ref> Such legislation, and the arrest and imprisonment of extremists may have decreased the incidence of attacks.<ref>Herbert, Ian (2007-01-27).

#'''Replacement''' refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aim.
