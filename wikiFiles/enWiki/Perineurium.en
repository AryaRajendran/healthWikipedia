In the [[peripheral nervous system]], nerve fibers are each wrapped in a protective sheath known as the [[endoneurium]]. These are bundled together into groups known as [[Nerve fascicle|fascicles]], each surrounded by a protective sheath known as the '''perineurium'''.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCracken|first=Thomas|title=New Atlas of Human Anatomy|year=1999|publisher=Metro Books|location=China|isbn=1-5866-3097-0|pages=96-97}}</ref>  Several fascicles may be in turn bundled together with a [[blood supply]] and [[fatty tissue]] within yet another sheath, the [[epineurium]]. This grouping structure is analogous to the muscular organization system of [[epimysium]], [[perimysium]] and [[endomysium]].

The '''perineurium''' is composed of [[connective tissue]], which has a distinctly [[lamellar]] arrangement consisting of roughly 7-8 concentric layers. The perineurium is cellular, and is composed of perineurial cells, which are [[epithelioid]] [[myofibroblasts]]. Perineurial cells are sometimes referred to as [[myoepithelioid]] due to their [[epithelioid]] and [[myofibroblastoid]] properties including [[tight junctions]], [[gap junctions]], [[external laminae]] and contractility. 

The '''perineurium''' is a smooth, transparent tubular membrane which may be easily separated from the fibers it encloses. In contrast, the [[epineurium]] is a tough and mechanically resistant tissue which is not easily penetrated by a needle.
