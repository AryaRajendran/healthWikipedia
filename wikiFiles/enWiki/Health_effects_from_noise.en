'''Noise health effects''' are the [[health]] consequences of elevated [[sound level]]s.  Elevated workplace or other [[noise]] can cause [[hearing impairment]], [[hypertension]], [[ischemic heart disease]], [[annoyance]], and [[sleep disturbance]]. Changes in the [[immune system]] and [[birth defect]]s have been attributed to noise exposure.<ref name="pmid10698728">{{cite journal |author=Passchier-Vermeer W, Passchier WF |title=Noise exposure and public health |journal=Environ.

There may be psychological definitions of noise as well. Firecrackers may upset domestic and wild animals or noise-traumatized individuals. The most common noise-traumatized persons are those exposed to military conflicts, but often loud groups of people can trigger complaints and other behaviors about noise. Infants are easily startled by noise. 

The social costs of traffic noise in EU22 are more than €40 billion per year, and passenger cars and lorries (trucks) are responsible for bulk of costs.<ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com">Traffic noise reduction in Europe, http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Vt3hjITbWvsJ:www.transportenvironment.org/Publications/prep_hand_out/lid:495+%22traffic+noise%22+europe+cardiovascular&hl=nn&gl=no</ref> Traffic noise alone is harming the health of almost every third person in the [[WHO]] European Region.

==Hearing loss==

{{main|Noise-induced hearing loss}}
The mechanism of [[hearing loss]] arises from [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to [[stereocilia]] of the [[cochlea]], the principal fluid filled structure of the [[inner ear]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] combined with the [[middle ear]] amplifies [[sound pressure level]]s by a factor of twenty, so that extremely high sound pressure levels arrive in the cochlea, even from moderate atmospheric sound [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. Underlying pathology to the [[cochlea]] are [[reactive oxygen species]], which play a significant role in noise-induced [[necrosis]] and [[apoptosis]] of the [[stereocilia]].<ref name = Henderson2006>{{cite journal |author=Henderson D, Bielefeld EC, Harris KC, Hu BH |title=The role of oxidative stress in noise-induced hearing loss |journal=Ear Hear |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |year=2006 |pmid=16446561 |doi=10.1097/01.aud.0000191942.36672.f3}}</ref> Exposure to high levels of noise have differing effects within a given population, <!-- How is the preceding clause attached to/related to the rest of the sentence? -->and the involvement of reactive oxygen species suggests possible avenues to treat or prevent damage to hearing and related cellular structures.<ref name = Henderson2006/> 

The elevated sound levels cause [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to  [[cochlea]]r structure in the [[inner ear]], which gives rise to irreversible [[hearing loss]].<ref name="Rosen">S. Rosen and P. Olin, ''Hearing Loss and Coronary [[Heart Disease]]'', Archives of [[Otolaryngology]], 82:236 (1965)</ref> A very loud sound in a particular frequency range can damage the cochlea's hair cells that respond to that range, thereby reducing the ear's ability to hear those frequencies in the future,<ref>[http://www.headwize.com/articles/hearing_art.htm HeadWize - Article: Preventing Hearing Damage When Listening With Headphones (A HeadWize Headphone Guide)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> however, loud noise in ''any'' frequency range has deleterious effects across the entire range of human hearing.<ref>[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA056415 High-Frequency Hearing Loss Incurred by Exposure to Low-Frequency Noise<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[Ear#Outer ear (pinna, ear canal, surface of ear drum)|outer ear]] (visible portion of the human [[ear]]) combined with the [[middle ear]] amplifies [[sound]] levels by a factor of 20 when sound reaches the [[inner ear]].<ref>''Noise: A Health Problem'' [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], Office of Noise Abatement and Control, Washington, DC 20460, August, 1978</ref>

===Age-related (presbycusis)===
{{See|Presbycusis}}
Hearing loss is somewhat inevitable with [[Presbycusis|age]]. Though older males exposed to significant [[Industrial noise|occupational noise]] demonstrate [[Statistical significance|significantly]] reduced hearing sensitivity compared to non-exposed peers, differences in hearing sensitivity decrease with time and the two groups are indistinguishable by age 79.<ref name="Rosenhall1990"/>  

Women exposed to occupational noise do not differ from their peers in hearing sensitivity, although they do hear better than their non-exposed male counterparts.<!--ref name = Rosenhall1990/ same as previous sentence -->  Due to loud music and a generally noisy environment, young people in the United States have a rate of impaired hearing 2.5 times greater than their parents and grandparents, with an estimated 50 million individuals with impaired hearing estimated in 2050.<ref name = Schmid>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/18/ap/health/mainD8NC00AO0.shtml | last = Schmid | first = RE | title=Aging nation faces growing hearing loss | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date = 2007-02-18 | accessdate=2007-02-18}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> 

In Rosen's work on [[health effect]]s and [[hearing loss]], one of his findings derived from tracking [[Maaban]] [[tribesmen]], who were insignificantly exposed to transportation or industrial noise. This population was systematically compared by [[cohort study|cohort]] group to a typical U.S. population. The findings proved that aging is an almost insignificant cause of [[hearing loss]], which instead is associated with chronic exposure to moderately high levels of [[environmental noise]].<ref name="Rosen"/>

== Cardiovascular effects ==
Noise has been associated with important cardiovascular health problems.<ref name="pmid12689488">{{cite journal |author=Ising H, Babisch W, Kruppa B |title=Noise-Induced Endocrine Effects and Cardiovascular Risk |journal=Noise Health |volume=1 |issue=4 | pages = 37–48 | year = 1999 | pmid = 12689488 |doi=| url = http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=1999;volume=1;issue=4;spage=37;epage=48;aulast=Ising}}</ref> In 1999, the World Health Organization concluded that the available evidence showed suggested a weak correlation between long-term noise exposure above 67-70 [[A-weighting|dB(A)]] and hypertension.<ref>{{cite web | last = Berglund  | first = B | coauthors =  Lindvall T, Schwela D, Goh KT | year = 1999 | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | title = World Health Organization: Guidelines for Community Noise | url = http://www.who.int/docstore/peh/noise/guidelines2.html}}</ref>  More recent studies have suggested that noise levels of 50 dB(A) at night may also increase the risk of [[myocardial infarction]] by chronically elevating [[cortisol]] production.<ref name="pmid12537833">{{cite journal |author=Maschke C |title=Stress Hormone Changes in Persons exposed to Simulated Night Noise |journal=Noise Health |volume=5 |issue=17 | pages = 35–45 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12537833 | doi = |url = http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2002;volume=5;issue=17;spage=35;epage=45;aulast=Maschke | accessdate = 2007-12-22}}</ref><ref name=Franssen>{{cite journal |author=Franssen EA, van Wiechen CM, Nagelkerke NJ, Lebret E |title=Aircraft noise around a large international airport and its impact on general health and medication use |journal=Occup Environ Med |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=405–13 |year=2004 |pmid=15090660 |pmc=1740783 |doi=10.1136/oem.2002.005488}}</ref><ref name=Lercher>{{cite journal |author=Lercher P, Hörtnagl J, Kofler WW |title=Work noise annoyance and blood pressure: combined effects with stressful working conditions |journal=Int Arch Occup Environ Health |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=23–8 |year=1993 |pmid=8354571 |doi=10.1007/BF00586054}}</ref>

Fairly typical roadway noise levels are sufficient to constrict arterial blood flow and lead to [[hypertension|elevated blood pressure]]; in this case, it appears that a certain fraction of the population is more susceptible to vasoconstriction. This may result because annoyance from the sound causes elevated [[adrenaline]] levels trigger a narrowing of the blood vessels ([[vasoconstriction]]), or independently through [[Stress (medicine)|medical stress]] reactions. Other effects of high noise levels are increased frequency of [[headache]]s, [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[stomach ulcer]]s, and [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].<ref>''Noise: A Health Problem'' United States [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], Office of Noise Abatement and Control, Washington, DC 20460, August, 1978</ref>

==Stress==
Research commissioned by Rockwool, a UK [[Soundproofing|insulation]] manufacturer, reveals in the UK one third (33%) of victims of domestic disturbances claim loud parties have left them unable to sleep or made them stressed in the last two years. Around one in eleven (9%) <ref>"How Noisy Neighbours Blight Millions of Lives, [[The Daily Express]], http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/94084/How-noisy-neighbours-millions-of-lives</ref> of those affected by domestic disturbances claims it has left them continually disturbed and stressed. More than 1.8 million people claim noisy neighbours have made their life a misery and they cannot enjoy their own homes. The impact of noise on health is potentially a significant problem across the UK given that more than 17.5 million Britons (38%) have been disturbed by the inhabitants of neighbouring properties in the last two years.  For almost one in ten (7%) Britons this is a regular occurrence.<ref>"How Noisy Neighbours Blight Millions of Lives, [[The Daily Express]], http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/94084/How-noisy-neighbours-millions-of-lives</ref>

The extent of the problem of noise pollution for public health is reinforced by figures collated by Rockwool from local authority responses to a [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOI) request. This research reveals in the period April 2008 - 2009 [[county council|UK councils]] received 315,838 complaints about noise pollution from private residences. This resulted in environmental health officers across the UK serving 8,069 [[noise abatement]] notices, or citations under the terms of the Anti-Social Behaviour (Scotland) Act.<ref>"How Noisy Neighbours Blight Millions of Lives, [[The Daily Express]], http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/94084/How-noisy-neighbours-millions-of-lives</ref>

[[Westminster City Council]] <ref>"London is home to the noisiest neighbours", [[London Evening Standard]], http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23714071-details/London+is+home+to+the+noisiest+neighbours/article.do.</ref> has received more complaints per head of population than any other district in the UK with 9,814 grievances about noise, which equates to 42.32 complaints per thousand residents. Eight of the top 10 councils ranked by complaints per 1,000 residents are located in [[London]].

==Annoyance==
Because some stressful effects depend on qualities of the sound other than its absolute decibel value, the annoyance associated with sound may need to be considered in regard to health effects. For example, noise from airports is typically perceived as more bothersome than noise from traffic of equal volume.<ref>Miedema and Oudshoorn 2001 cited in {{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/516462|title=Hypertension and exposure to noise near airports|publisher=Medscape}}</ref> Annoyance effects of noise are minimally affected by demographics, but fear of the noise source and sensitivity to noise both strongly affect the 'annoyance' of a noise.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Miedema HME, Vos H | title = Demographic and attitudinal factors that modify annoyance from transportation noise | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 105 | issue = 6 | pages = 3336–44 | doi = 10.1121/1.424662 | year = 1999 }}</ref> Even sound levels as low as 40 dB(A) (about as loud as a refrigerator or library<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chiltern.gov.uk/downloads/Decibel_chart_06[1].pdf | title = Noise Facts and Figures! | format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-12-13 | publisher = [[Chiltern (district)|Chiltern]] District Council}}</ref>) can generate noise complaints<ref>{{cite book |author=Gelfand, Stanley A |title=Essentials of Audiology |publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers |location=New York |isbn=1-58890-017-7 |year=2001}}</ref> and the lower threshold for noise producing [[sleep disturbance]] is 45 dB(A) or lower.<ref>{{cite book |author=Walker, JR; Fahy, Frank |title=Fundamentals of noise and vibration |publisher=E & FN Spon |location=London |year=1998 |isbn=0-419-22700-8}}</ref>  

Other factors that affect the 'annoyance level' of sound include beliefs about noise prevention and the importance of the noise source, and annoyance at the cause (i.e. non-noise related factors) of the noise.<ref name = Field1993>{{cite journal | first = JM | last = Field | title = Effect of personal and situational variables upon noise annoyance in residential areas | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 93 | issue = 5 | pages = 2753–63 | year = 1993 |doi = 10.1121/1.405851 | accessdate = 2007-12-13}}</ref> For instance, in an office setting, audible telephone conversations and discussions between co-workers were considered to be irritating, depending upon the contents of the conversations. Many of the interpretations of the level of annoyance and the relationship between noise levels and resulting health symptoms could be influenced by the quality of interpersonal relationships at the workplace, as well as the stress level generated by the work itself.<ref name="Passchier-Vermeer, W. and W.F. Passchier 123–131">{{cite journal | author = Passchier-Vermeer, W. and W.F. Passchier | title = Noise exposure and public health | journal = Environment Health Perspectives | volume = 108 | issue = 1 | pages = 123–131 | date = March 2000 | doi = 10.2307/3454637 | pmid=10698728 | pmc=1637786 | jstor=3454637}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Halpern, David | title = Mental health and the built environment: more than bricks and mortar? | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-7484-0235-7 }}</ref> Evidence regarding the impact of long-term noise versus recent changes in ongoing noise is equivocal regarding its impact on annoyance.<ref name = Field1993/><!-- There must be a more straightforward way to phrase that sentence, I had to read it several times -->

Estimates of [[sound annoyance]] typically rely on [[weighting filter]]s, which consider some sound frequencies to be more important than others based on their presumed audibility to humans. The older dB(A) weighting filter described above is used widely in the U.S., but underestimates the impact of frequencies around 6000&nbsp;Hz and at very low frequencies. The newer [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] filter is used more widely in Europe. The propagation of sound varies between environments; for example, low frequencies typically carry over longer distances. Therefore different filters, such as [[dB(B)]] and [[dB(C)]], may be recommended for specific situations.

Furthermore, studies have shown that neighborhood noise (consisting of noise from neighboring apartments, as well as noise within one's own apartment or home) can cause significant irritation and noise stress within people, due to the great deal of time people spend within their residences. This can result in an increased risk of depression and psychological disorders,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pichot, P. | title = Noise, sleep and behavior | journal = Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de médecine | volume = 176 | issue = 3 | pages = 393–9 | date = March 1992 }}</ref><ref name="Niemann, H., et. al. 63–79">{{cite journal | doi = 10.4103/1463-1741.33537 | author = Niemann, H., et. al. | title = Noise-induced annoyance and morbidity results from the pan-European LARES study | journal = Noise Health | volume = 8 | issue = 31 | pages = 63–79 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17687182 }}</ref> migraines, and even emotional stress.<ref name="Niemann, H., et. al. 63–79"/>

In the workplace, noise pollution is generally a problem once the noise level is greater than 55 dB(A). Selected studies show that approximately 35 to 40% of workers in office settings find noise levels from 55 to 60 dB(A) to be extremely irritating.<ref name="Passchier-Vermeer, W. and W.F. Passchier 123–131"/> The noise standard in Germany for mentally stressful tasks is set at 55 dB(A),<ref>{{cite book | author = Stellman, Jeanne Mager | title = Encyclopedia of occupational health and safety | publisher = International Labour Organization | year = 1998 | isbn = 92-2-109203-8 }}</ref> however, if the noise source is continuous, the threshold level for tolerable noise levels amongst office workers becomes lower than 55 dB(A).<ref name="Passchier-Vermeer, W. and W.F. Passchier 123–131"/>

One important effect of noise is to make a person's [[speech]] less easy to hear. The human brain automatically compensates the production of speech for background noise in a process called the [[Lombard effect]] in which it becomes louder with more distinct [[syllable]]s. But this cannot fully remove the problems of [[Intelligibility (communication)|communication intelligibility]] made in noise.

== Child physical development ==
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] authored a pamphlet in 1978 that suggested a correlation between low-birthweight babies (using the [[World Health Organization]] definition of less than 2,500 g (~5.5 [[pound (mass)|lb]]) and high sound levels, and also correlations in abnormally high rates of [[birth defect]]s, where expectant mothers are exposed to elevated sound levels, such as typical [[airport]] environs. Specific birth abnormalities included [[harelip]], [[cleft palate]], and defects in the [[Vertebral column|spine]].<ref>''Noise: A Health Problem'' United States [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], Office of Noise Abatement and Control, Washington, D.C. 20460, August, 1978</ref>  

According to Lester W. Sontag of The Fels Research Institute (as presented in the same EPA study): “There is ample evidence that environment has a role in shaping the physique, behavior, and function of animals, including man, from [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and not merely from [[birth]]. The [[fetus]] is capable of perceiving sounds and responding to them by motor activity and cardiac rate change." Noise exposure is deemed to be especially pernicious when it occurs between 15 and 60 days after conception, when major internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] and the [[central nervous system]] are formed.<ref>''Noise: A Health Problem'' United States [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], Office of Noise Abatement and Control, Washington, D.C. 20460, August, 1978</ref>  

Later developmental effects occur as vasoconstriction in the mother reduces blood flow and hence, [[oxygen]] and nutrition to the fetus. Low birth weights and noise were also associated with lower levels of certain [[hormone]]s in the mother, these hormones being thought to affect fetal growth and to be a good indicator of [[protein]] production. The difference between the hormone levels of pregnant mothers in noisy versus quiet areas increased as birth approached.<ref>''Noise: A Health Problem'' United States [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], Office of Noise Abatement and Control, Washington, D.C. 20460, August, 1978</ref>  

In a 2000 publication, a review of studies on birthweight and noise exposure note that while some older studies suggest that when women are exposed to >65 dB aircraft noise a small decrease in birthweight occurs, in a more recent study of 200 Taiwanese women including noise dosimetry measurements of individual noise exposure the authors found no significant association between noise exposure and birth weight after adjusting for relevant confounders, e.g. social class, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, etc.<ref name="pmid10698728"/>

=== Cognitive development ===

When young children are exposed to speech interference levels of noise on a regular basis (the volume of which varies depending on distance and loudness of the speaker), they may develop speech or reading difficulties, because auditory processing functions are compromised. Children continue to develop their speech perception abilities until they reach their teenage years.  Evidence has shown that when children learn in noisier classrooms, they have a more difficult time understanding speech than those who learn in quieter settings.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nelson, Peggy B. | title = Sound in the Classroom | journal = ASHRAE journal | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 22–25 | year = 1959 }}</ref>  

In a study conducted by Cornell University in 1993, children exposed to noise in learning environments experienced trouble with word discrimination as well as various cognitive developmental delays.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wakefield, Julie | title = Learning the Hard Way | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 110 | issue = 6 | date = June 2002 }}</ref> In particular the writing learning impairment known as [[dysgraphia]] is commonly associated with environmental [[stressor]]s in the classroom.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} 

The effect of high noise levels on small children has been known to cause physical health damages as well. Children from noisy residences often possess a heart rate that is significantly higher (by 2 beats/min on average) than in children from quieter residences.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goran, Belojevic, et. al. | title = Urban Road Traffic Noise and Blood Pressure and Heart Rate in Preschool Children | journal = Environment International | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–231 | doi = 10.1016/j.envint.2007.08.003 | pmid = 17869340 | year = 2008 }}</ref>

==Regulations==
{{main|Noise regulation}}

Environmental [[noise regulation]]s usually specify a maximum outdoor noise level of 60 to 65 [[A-weighting|dB(A)]], while occupational safety organizations recommend that the maximum exposure to noise is 40 hours per week at 85 to 90 dB(A). For every additional 3 dB(A), the maximum exposure time is reduced by a factor 2, e.g. 20 hours per week at 88 dB(A). Sometimes, a factor of two per additional 5 dB(A) is used, however, these occupational regulations are acknowledged by the health literature as inadequate to protect against [[hearing loss]] and other health effects.

With regard to indoor noise pollution in residences, the U.S. EPA has not set any restrictions on limits to the level of noise. Rather, it has provided a list of recommended levels in its ''Model Community Noise Control Ordinance'', which was published in 1975. For instance, the recommended noise level for indoor residences is less than or equal to 45 dB.<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams, Luanne Kemp; Langley, Rick L. |title=Environmental Health Secrets |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |location=Philadelphia |year=2000 |isbn=1-56053-408-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=EPA Identifies Noise Levels Affecting Health and Welfare |date=April 2, 1972 | url=http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/noise/01.htm}}</ref>  

Noise pollution control in residences is not funded by the federal government in part because of the disagreements in establishing causal links between sounds and health risks, since the effect of noise is often psychological and also, because it leaves no singular tangible trace of damage on the human body. For instance, hearing loss could be attributed to a variety of factors including age, rather than solely due to excessive exposure to noise.<ref name="Schmidt, Charles W.
