{{Main|Myocardial infarction}}
A '''diagnosis of myocardial infarction''' is made by integrating the history of the presenting illness and physical examination with [[electrocardiogram]] findings and [[cardiac marker]]s ([[blood test]]s for [[Cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] damage).<ref name="Mallinson 2010 15">{{cite journal | last=Mallinson | first=T | title=Myocardial Infarction | journal=Focus on First Aid | volume= | issue=15 | pages=15 | date=2010 | pmid= | url=http://www.focusonfirstaid.co.uk/Magazine/issue15/index.aspx | accessdate=2010-06-08 | doi= }}</ref><ref name=GPnotebook_MI>[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=892665874&linkID=23278&cook=yes Myocardial infarction: diagnosis and investigations] - [[GPnotebook]], retrieved November 27, 2006.</ref> A [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiogram]] allows visualization of narrowings or obstructions on the heart vessels, and therapeutic measures can follow immediately.

==Diagnostic criteria==
According to the WHO criteria as revised in 2000,<ref name="Alpert-2000">{{cite journal | author=Alpert JS, Thygesen K, Antman E, Bassand JP. | title=Myocardial infarction redefined--a consensus document of The Joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Committee for the redefinition of myocardial infarction | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol | year=2000 | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=959–69 | pmid=10987628 | doi=10.1016/S0735-1097(00)00804-4}}</ref> a cardiac [[troponin]] rise accompanied by either typical symptoms, pathological Q waves, ST elevation or depression or coronary intervention are diagnostic of MI.

Previous WHO criteria<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anonymous |title=Nomenclature and criteria for diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. Report of the Joint International Society and Federation of Cardiology/World Health Organization task force on standardization of clinical nomenclature |journal=Circulation |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=607–9 |year=1979 |month=March |pmid=761341}}</ref> formulated in 1979 put less emphasis on cardiac biomarkers; according to these, a patient is diagnosed with myocardial infarction if two (probable) or three (definite) of the following criteria are satisfied:
# Clinical history of ischaemic type chest pain lasting for more than 20 minutes
# Changes in serial ECG tracings
# Rise and fall of serum cardiac biomarkers such as [[creatine kinase]]-MB fraction and [[troponin]]

==Physical examination==

The general appearance of patients may vary according to the experienced symptoms; the patient may be comfortable, or restless and in severe distress with an increased [[respiratory rate]]. A cool and [[pallor|pale skin]] is common and points to [[vasoconstriction]]. Some patients have low-grade fever (38–39 °C). [[Blood pressure]] may be elevated or decreased, and the [[pulse]] can become [[Cardiac arrhythmia|irregular]].<ref name=emedicine>S. Garas ''et al.''.

If heart failure ensues, elevated [[jugular venous pressure]] and [[hepatojugular reflux]], or swelling of the legs due to peripheral [[edema]] may be found on inspection. Rarely, a cardiac bulge with a pace different from the pulse rhythm can be felt on [[precordial examination]]. Various abnormalities can be found on [[auscultation]], such as a third and fourth [[heart sounds|heart sound]], [[Heart murmur|systolic murmurs]], paradoxical splitting of the second heart sound, a [[Pericardium|pericardial]] friction rub and [[rales]] over the lung.<ref name=emedicine/><ref name=harrisons-p1450>Kasper DL, ''et al.''

==Electrocardiogram==

{{Main|Electrocardiography in myocardial infarction}}
[[Image:12 Lead EKG ST Elevation tracing color coded.jpg|thumb|12-lead [[electrocardiogram]] showing ST-segment elevation (orange) in I, aVL and V1-V5 with reciprocal changes (blue) in the inferior leads, indicative of an anterior wall myocardial infarction.]]

The primary purpose of the [[electrocardiogram]] is to detect [[ischemia]] or acute coronary injury in broad, symptomatic [[emergency department]] populations. A serial ECG may be used to follow rapid changes in time. The standard 12 lead ECG does not directly examine the [[right ventricle]], and is relatively poor at examining the posterior basal and lateral walls of the [[left ventricle]]. In particular, acute myocardial infarction in the distribution of the circumflex artery is likely to produce a nondiagnostic ECG.<ref name=Cannon_175>Cannon CP at al. ''Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes''. p. 175. New Jersey: Humana Press, 1999. ISBN 0-89603-552-2.</ref> The use of additional ECG leads like right-sided leads V3R and V4R and posterior leads V7, V8, and V9 may improve sensitivity for right ventricular and posterior myocardial infarction. 

The 12 lead ECG is used to classify patients into one of three groups:<ref name="ECC_2005_ACS">{{cite journal | title=2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care&nbsp;— Part 8: Stabilization of the Patient With Acute Coronary Syndromes | journal=Circulation | year=2005 | volume=112 | pages=IV–89–IV–110 | doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166561 | pmid=16314375 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-89}}</ref>
# those with [[ST segment elevation]] or new [[bundle branch block]] (suspicious for acute injury and a possible candidate for acute reperfusion therapy with [[thrombolysis|thrombolytics]] or primary [[percutaneous coronary intervention|PCI]]),
# those with ST segment depression or T wave inversion (suspicious for ischemia), and
# those with a so-called non-diagnostic or normal ECG.

A normal ECG does not rule out acute myocardial infarction. Mistakes in interpretation are relatively common, and the failure to identify high risk features has a negative effect on the quality of patient care.<ref name="EDQMI_2006">{{cite journal |author=Masoudi FA, Magid DJ, Vinson DR, ''et al.'' |title=Implications of the failure to identify high-risk electrocardiogram findings for the quality of care of patients with acute myocardial infarction: results of the Emergency Department Quality in Myocardial Infarction (EDQMI) study |journal=Circulation |volume=114 |issue=15 |pages=1565–71 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17015790 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.623652 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/114/15/1565}}</ref>

==Cardiac markers==

{{Main|Cardiac marker}}

Cardiac markers or cardiac enzymes are proteins that leak out of injured myocardial cells through their damaged cell membranes into the bloodstream. Until the 1980s, the enzymes [[Aspartate transaminase|SGOT]] and [[lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]] were used to assess cardiac injury. Now, the markers most widely used in detection of MI are ''MB'' subtype of the enzyme [[creatine kinase]] and cardiac [[troponin]]s T and I as they are more specific for myocardial injury. The cardiac troponins T and I which are released within 4–6 hours of an attack of MI and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks, have nearly complete tissue specificity and are now the preferred markers for asssessing myocardial damage.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eisenman A | title = Troponin assays for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome: where do we stand? | journal = Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 509–14 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16918269 | doi = 10.1586/14779072.4.4.509}}</ref>
[[Heart-type fatty acid binding protein]] is another marker, used in some home test kits.
Elevated troponins in the setting of chest pain may accurately predict a high likelihood of a myocardial infarction in the near future.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Aviles RJ, Askari AT, Lindahl B, Wallentin L, Jia G, Ohman EM, Mahaffey KW, Newby LK, Califf RM, Simoons ML, Topol EJ, Berger P, Lauer MS | title = [[Troponin]] T levels in patients with acute coronary syndromes, with or without renal dysfunction | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 346 | issue = 26 | pages = 2047–52 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12087140 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa013456}}.

The diagnosis of myocardial infarction requires two out of three components (history, ECG, and enzymes).  When damage to the heart occurs, levels of cardiac markers rise over time, which is why [[blood test]]s for them are taken over a 24-hour period. Because these enzyme levels are not elevated immediately following a heart attack, patients presenting with chest pain are generally treated with the assumption that a myocardial infarction has occurred and then evaluated for a more precise diagnosis.<ref name="Braunwald-2002">{{cite journal | author=Braunwald E, Antman EM, Beasley JW, Califf RM, Cheitlin MD, Hochman JS, Jones RH, Kereiakes D, Kupersmith J, Levin TN, Pepine CJ, Schaeffer JW, Smith EE III, Steward DE, Théroux P. | title=ACC/AHA 2002 guideline update for the management of patients with unstable angina and non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Committee on the Management of Patients With Unstable Angina) | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol | year=2002 | volume=40 | pages=1366–74 | pmid=12383588 | format=[[PDF]] | url=http://www.acc.org/qualityandscience/clinical/guidelines/unstable/incorporated/UA_incorporated.pdf | issue=7}}</ref>

==Angiography==

[[Image:Ha1.jpg|thumb|[[Angiogram]] of the coronary arteries.]]
{{Main|Coronary catheterization}}

In difficult cases or in situations where intervention to restore blood flow is appropriate, coronary [[angiography]] can be performed. A [[catheter]] is inserted into an artery (usually the [[femoral artery]]) and pushed to the vessels supplying the heart. A radio-opaque dye is administered through the catheter and a sequence of x-rays (fluoroscopy) is performed. Obstructed or narrowed arteries can be identified, and [[angioplasty]] applied as a therapeutic measure (see below). Angioplasty requires extensive skill, especially in emergency settings. It is performed by a physician trained in [[interventional cardiology]].

==Histopathology==

{{See|Timeline of myocardial infarction pathology}}
[[Image:Myocardial infarct emmolition phase histopathology.jpg|thumb|Microscopy image (magn. ca 100x, [[H&E stain]]) from autopsy specimen of myocardial infarct (7 days post-infarction).]]
[[Anatomical pathology|Histopathological]] examination of the heart may reveal infarction at autopsy. Under the microscope, myocardial infarction presents as a circumscribed area of ischemic, coagulative [[necrosis]] (cell death). On gross examination, the infarct is not identifiable within the first 12 hours.<ref name=rubin546>{{cite book | coauthors = Emanuel Rubin, Fred Gorstein, Raphael Rubin, Roland Schwarting, David Strayer | title = Rubin's Pathology&nbsp;— Clinicopathological Foundations of Medicine | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | date = 2001 | location = Maryland | pages = 546 | isbn = 0-7817-4733-3 }}</ref>

[[Image:MI with contraction bands very high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a '''myocardial infarction''' (ca. 400x H&E stain ) with prominent contraction band [[necrosis]].]]
Although earlier changes can be discerned using [[electron microscopy]], one of the earliest changes under a normal microscope are so-called ''wavy fibers''.<ref name=Eichbaum1975>{{cite journal | author = Eichbaum FW | year = 1975 | title = 'Wavy' myocardial fibers in spontaneous and experimental adrenergic cardiopathies | url = | journal = Cardiology | volume = 60 | issue = 6| pages = 358–65 | pmid = 782705 }}</ref> Subsequently, the myocyte [[cytoplasm]] becomes more [[eosinophilic]] (pink) and the cells lose their transversal striations, with typical changes and eventually loss of the [[cell nucleus]].<ref name=histopathologyIndia>S Roy. [http://www.histopathology-india.net/Heart5.htm Myocardial infarction].

The necrotic area is surrounded and progressively invaded by [[granulation tissue]], which will replace the infarct with a fibrous ([[collagen]]ous) [[scar]] (which are typical steps in [[wound healing]]). The interstitial space (the space between cells outside of blood vessels) may be infiltrated with [[red blood cell]]s.<ref name=rubin546/>

These features can be recognized in cases where the perfusion was not restored; reperfused infarcts can have other hallmarks, such as [[contraction band necrosis]].<ref name="Fishbein-1990">{{cite doi | 10.1002/clc.4960130312}}</ref>
