A '''placebo''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|p|l|ə|ˈ|s|i|b|oʊ}} {{respell|plə|SEE|boh}}; [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:placebo#Latin|placēbō]]'', "I shall please"<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Minerva Med]] |date = April 2005|volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=121–4 |title=Past and present of ''what will please the lord'': an updated history of the concept of placebo |author=Gensini GF, Conti AA, Conti A |pmid=16172581 }}</ref> from ''[[wikt:en:placeo#Latin|placeō]]'', "I please") is a simulated or otherwise medically ineffectual treatment for a disease or other medical condition intended to deceive the recipient. Sometimes patients given a placebo treatment will have a perceived or actual improvement in a medical condition, a phenomenon commonly called the '''placebo effect'''.

In medical research, placebos are given as [[Scientific control|control]] treatments and depend on the use of measured deception. Common placebos include inert tablets, vehicle infusions, [[sham surgery]],<ref name=inquiry_cfm>{{cite web |author=UK Parliamentary Committee Science and Technology Committee |url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/science_technology/s_t_homeopathy_inquiry.cfm |title=Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy }}</ref> and other procedures based on false information.<ref name="Lanotte">{{cite journal |author=Lanotte M, Lopiano L, Torre E, Bergamasco B, Colloca L, Benedetti F |title=Expectation enhances autonomic responses to stimulation of the human subthalamic limbic region |journal=Brain, Behavior, and Immunity |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=500–9 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16055306 |doi=10.1016/j.bbi.2005.06.004}}</ref> However, placebos can also have a surprisingly positive effect on a patient who knows that the given treatment is without any active drug, as compared with a control group who knowingly did ''not'' get a placebo.<ref name="Kaptchuk et al"/>

In one common placebo procedure, however, a patient is given an inert pill, told that it may improve his/her condition, but not told that it is in fact inert. Such an intervention may cause the patient to believe the treatment will change his/her condition; and this belief may produce a subjective perception of a [[therapeutic effect]], causing the patient to feel their condition has improved &mdash; or an actual improvement in their condition. This phenomenon is known as the placebo effect.

Placebos are widely used in [[medical research]] and [[medicine]],<ref name="H Norup" /> and the placebo effect is a pervasive phenomenon;<ref name="H Norup">{{cite journal |author=Hróbjartsson A, Norup M |title=The use of placebo interventions in medical practice--a national questionnaire survey of Danish clinicians |journal=Evaluation & the Health Professions |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=153–65 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12789709 |url=http://ehp.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12789709 |doi=10.1177/0163278703026002002}}</ref> in fact, it is part of the response to any active medical intervention.<ref name=eccles>{{cite journal |author=Eccles R |year=2002 |title=The powerful placebo in cough studies? |journal=[[Pulm Pharmacol Ther]] |volume=15 |pages=251–2 |pmid=12099783 |issue=3 |doi=10.1006/pupt.2002.0364}}</ref> Archie Cochrane suggested in 1972<ref>Cochrane, A.L.: Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services.

The effect of placebos has been shown by randomized controlled trials to be very large. Their use in the correct place is to be encouraged […]"

The placebo effect points to the importance of perception and [[Neural top down control of physiology|the brain's role in physical health]]. However, the use of placebos as treatment in clinical medicine (as opposed to laboratory research) is ethically problematic as it introduces deception and dishonesty into the doctor-patient relationship.<ref name=Newman/> The [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Parliamentary Committee]] on Science and Technology has stated that: "...prescribing placebos... usually relies on some degree of patient deception" and "prescribing pure placebos is bad medicine. Their effect is unreliable and unpredictable and cannot form the sole basis of any treatment on the NHS."<ref name=inquiry_cfm/>

Since the publication of [[Henry K. Beecher]]'s ''The Powerful Placebo'' <ref name=Beecher1995>{{Cite PMID|13271123}}</ref> in 1955, the phenomenon has been considered to have clinically important effects.<ref name=Hrob2001/> This view was notably challenged when, in 2001, a [[systematic review]] of clinical trials concluded that there was no evidence of clinically important effects, except perhaps in the treatment of pain and continuous subjective outcomes.<ref name=Hrob2001/> The article received a flurry of criticism,<ref name=Moerman2002/> but the authors later published a [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] review with similar conclusions (updated {{As of|2010|lc=on}}).<ref name=CochraneHrob2010>{{cite journal |author=Hróbjartsson A, Gøtzsche PC |title=Placebo interventions for all clinical conditions |journal=[[Cochrane Database Syst Rev]] |volume= 106 |issue=1 |pages=CD003974 |date=20 January 2010 |pmid=20091554 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003974.pub3 |editor1-last=Hróbjartsson |editor1-first=Asbjørn }}</ref> Most studies have attributed the difference from baseline till the end of the trial to a placebo effect, but the reviewers examined studies which had both placebo and untreated groups in order to distinguish the placebo effect from the natural progression of the disease.<ref name=Hrob2001/> However these conclusions have been criticized because of the great variety of diseases—more than 40—in this metastudy. The effect of placebo is very different in different diseases. By pooling quite different diseases the results can be leveled out.

== Definitions, effects, and ethics ==
{{see also|Medical ethics}}
A placebo has been defined as "a substance or procedure… that is objectively without specific activity for the condition being treated".<ref name=Moerman2002/> Under this definition, a wide variety of things can be placebos and exhibit a placebo effect. [[pharmacology|Pharmacological]] substances [[Route of administration|administered]] through any means can act as placebos, including [[Pill (pharmacy)|pills]], [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[Inhaler|inhalants]], and [[Injection (medicine)|injections]].

The placebo effect has sometimes been defined as a physiological effect caused by the placebo, but Moerman and Jonas have pointed out that this seems illogical, as a placebo is an inert substance that does not directly cause anything. Instead they introduced the word "''meaning response''" for the meaning that the brain associates with the placebo, which causes a physiological placebo effect. They propose that the placebo, which may be unethical, could be avoided entirely if doctors comfort and encourage their patients' health.<ref name=Moerman2002>{{cite journal |author=Moerman DE, Jonas WB |year=2002 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/136/6/471 |title=Deconstructing the placebo effect and finding the meaning response |journal=Ann Intern Med. |volume=136 |issue=6 | pages = 471–6 |pmid=11900500}}</ref> Ernst and Resch also attempted to distinguish between the "true" and "perceived" placebo effect, as they argued that some of the effects attributed to the placebo effect could be due to other factors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ernst E, Resch KL |title = Concept of true and perceived placebo effects |journal=BMJ |volume=311 |issue=7004 |pages=551–3 |year=1995 |month=August |pmid=7663213 |pmc=2550609 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.311.7004.551|url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7663213}}</ref>

The placebo effect has been controversial throughout history.

==History==
{{Main|Placebo in history}}
The word 'placebo', Latin for "I will please", dates back to a Latin translation of the Bible by [[St Jerome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jacobs B. |year=2000 |pmc=1297986 |title=Biblical origins of placebo |journal=[[J R Soc Med.]] |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=213–4 |pmid=10844895}}</ref> It was first used in a medicinal context in the 18th century.

Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 72(3), 389-433.</ref> Later, researchers became interested in understanding the placebo effect, rather than just controlling for its effects, and in 2011, a [[Program in Placebo Studies]] was established at the [[Harvard Medical School]].

==Mechanism of the effect==
The placebo effect is highly variable in its magnitude and reliability and is typically strongest in measures of subjective symptoms (e.g., pain) and typically weak-to-nonexistent in objective measures of health points (e.g., [[blood pressure]], infection clearance).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

A 2001 [[meta-analysis]] of clinical trials with placebo groups and no-treatment groups found no evidence for a placebo effect on objectively measured outcomes and possible small benefits in studies with continuous subjective outcomes (particularly pain).<ref name=Hrob2001/> A 2004 follow-up analysis found similar results and increased evidence of bias in smaller trials that calls into question the apparent placebo effect on subjective outcomes.<ref name=Hrob2004/>

Because the placebo response is simply the patient response that cannot be attributed to an investigational intervention, there are multiple possible components of a measured placebo effect. These components having varying relevance depending on study design and the types of observations.<ref name="Kienle & Kiene">{{cite journal |author=Kienle GS, Kiene H |title=The powerful placebo effect: fact or fiction? |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=50 |issue=12 |pages=1311–8 |year=1997 |month=December |pmid=9449934 |doi= |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895435697002035}}</ref> While there is some evidence that placebo interventions can alter levels of [[hormone]]s<ref>Kokkotou E et al.

=== Expectancy and conditioning ===
The placebo effect is related to the perceptions and expectations of the patient; if the substance is viewed as helpful, it can heal, but, if it is viewed as harmful, it can cause negative effects, which is known as the [[nocebo]] effect. In 1985, [[Irving Kirsch]] hypothesized that placebo effects are produced by the self-fulfilling effects of response expectancies, in which the belief that one will feel different leads a person to actually feel different.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kirsch I | year = 1985 | title = Response expectancy as a determinant of experience and behavior | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 40 | issue = 11| pages = 1189–1202 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.40.11.1189 }}</ref> According to this theory, the belief that one has received an active treatment can produce the subjective changes thought to be produced by the real treatment.

Because placebos are dependent upon perception and expectation, various factors that change the perception can increase the magnitude of the placebo response.

These changes can act upon the brain's early stages of information processing: Research using [[Event-related potential|evoked brain potentials]] upon painful laser pulses, for example, finds placebo effects upon the N2–P2, a biphasic negative–positive complex response, the N2 peak of which is at about 230 ms, and the P2 one at about 380 ms.<ref name="Colloca et al 2008"/> They occur not only during placebo analgesia but after receiving the analgesic placebo (the areas are different here, and involve the [[medial prefrontal cortex]], [[posterior parietal cortex]] and [[inferior parietal lobule]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nemoto H, Nemoto Y, Toda H, Mikuni M, Fukuyama H |year=2007 |title=Placebo analgesia: a PET study |journal=[[Exp Brain Res]] |volume=179 |pages=655–64 |pmid=17287994 |doi=10.1007/s00221-006-0821-z |issue=4}}</ref>

The higher brain works by regulating subcortical processes.

===Brain and body===
{{Details|neural top down control of physiology}}

The brain has control over the body processes affected by placebos. Pain, [[Muscle weakness|motor fatigue]], and [[fever]] are directly organized by the brain. Other processes usually regulated by the body such as the [[immune system]] are also controlled indirectly through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.

Research upon [[classical conditioning|conditioning]] in animals shows the brain can learn control over them. In conditioning, a neutral stimulus [[saccharin]] is paired in a drink with an agent that produces an unconditioned response. For example, that agent might be [[cyclophosphamide]] that causes [[immunosuppressive|immunosuppression]]. After learning this pairing, the taste of saccharin by itself through neural top-down control created immunosuppression, as a new conditioned response.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1975 |title=Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression |journal=[[Psychosom Med]] |volume=37 |pages=333–40 |pmid=1162023 |last1=Ader |first1=R |last2=Cohen |first2=N |issue=4 |unused_data=Ader R, Cohen N}}</ref> Such conditioning has been found to affect a diverse variety of not just basic physiological processes in the immune system but ones such as [[Serum iron|serum iron levels]], [[DNA oxidation|oxidative DNA damage]] levels, and [[insulin]] secretion.

===Evolved health regulation===
[[Evolutionary medicine]] identifies many symptoms such as [[fever]], [[pain]], and [[sickness behavior]] as [[Health management system#Evolutionary medicine|evolved responses]] to protect or enhance the recovery from [[infection]] and [[injury]]. [[Fever]], for example, is an evolved self-treatment that removes [[bacteria]] or [[viruses]] through [[hyperthermia|raised body temperature]]. These [[adaptation|evolved]] responses, however, also have a [[deployment cost-benefit selection in physiology|cost]] that depending upon circumstances can outweigh their benefit (due to this, for example, there is a reduction in fever during [[malnutrition]] or [[pregnancy|late pregnancy]]). According to the [[health management system]] theory proposed by [[Nicholas Humphrey]], the brain has been selected to ensure that evolved responses are deployed only when the [[Cost-benefit analysis|cost benefit]] is biologically [[biological fitness|advantageous]]. To do this, the brain factors in a variety of information sources, including the likelihood derived from beliefs that the body will get well without deploying its costly evolved responses. One such source of information is the knowledge the body is receiving care and treatment. The placebo effect in this perspective arises when false information about [[medications]] misleads the health management system about the likelihood of getting well so that it selects not to deploy an evolved self-treatment.<ref name="Great">{{cite book |authorlink=Nicholas Humphrey |author=Humphrey N |year=2002 |url=http://www.humphrey.org.uk/papers/2002GreatExpectations.pdf |chapter=Great Expectations: The Evolutionary Psychology of Faith-Healing and the Placebo Effect |title=The Mind Made Flesh: Essays from the Frontiers of Psychology and Evolution |pages=255–85 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-280227-9}}</ref>

The studies were performed as two [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]]. They found that in studies with a [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] outcome, meaning patients were classified as improved or not improved, the placebo group had no [[statistically significant]] improvement over the no-treatment group. Likewise, there was no significant placebo effect in studies in which [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] outcomes (such as blood pressure) were measured by an independent observer. The placebo effect could be documented only in studies in which the outcomes (improvement or failure to improve) were reported by the subjects themselves. The authors concluded that the placebo effect does not have "powerful clinical effects," (''objective'' effects) and that patient-reported improvements (''subjective'' effects) in pain were small and could not be clearly distinguished from [[reporting bias]]. Other researchers (Wampold ''et al.'') re-analysed the same data from the 2001 meta-analysis and concluded that the placebo effects for objective symptom measures are comparable to placebo effects for subjective ones and that the placebo effect can exceed the effect of the active treatment by 20% for disorders amenable to the placebo effect,<ref name="Wampold">{{cite journal |author=Wampold BE, Minami T, Tierney SC, Baskin TW, Bhati KS |year=2005 |title=The placebo is powerful: estimating placebo effects in medicine and psychotherapy from randomized clinical trials |journal=[[J Clin Psychol]] |volume=61 |pages=835–54 |pmid=15827993 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20129 |issue=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wampold BE, Imel ZE, Minami T |year=2007 |title=The placebo effect: "relatively large" and "robust" enough to survive another assault |journal=[[J Clin Psychol]] |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=401–3 |pmid=17279522 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20350}}</ref> a conclusion which Hróbjartsson & Gøtzsche described as "powerful spin".<ref name="PMID 17279532">{{cite journal |author=Hróbjartsson A, Gøtzsche PC |year=2007 |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=63 |issue=4 | pages=373–7 |title=Powerful spin in the conclusion of Wampold et al.'s re-analysis of placebo versus no-treatment trials despite similar results as in original review |pmid=17279532 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20357}}</ref> Another group of researchers noted the dramatically different conclusions between these two sets of authors despite nearly identical meta-analytic results, and suggested that placebo effects are indeed significant but small in magnitude.<ref name="PMID 17279525">{{cite journal |author=Hunsley J, Westmacott R |year=2007 |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=63 |issue=4 | pages=391–9 |title=Interpreting the magnitude of the placebo effect: mountain or Molehill? |pmid=17279525 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20352}}</ref>

Hróbjartsson and Gøtzsche's conclusion has been criticised on several grounds. Their meta-analysis covered studies into a highly mixed group of conditions. It has been reported that for measurements in peripheral organs the placebo effect seems to be more effective in achieving improvements in physical parameters (such as decreasing hypertension, improving [[FEV1]] in asthma sufferers, or decreasing prostatic hyperplasia or anal fissure) than in improving biochemical parameters (such as [[cholesterol]] or [[cortisol]]) in various conditions such as venous leg ulcers, Crohn's disease, urinary tract infection, and chronic heart failure.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite journal |author=Meissner K, Distel H, Mitzdorf U |year=2007 |pmc=1847831 |title=Evidence for placebo effects on physical but not on biochemical outcome parameters: a review of clinical trials |journal=[[BMC Med]] |volume=5 |page=3 |pmid=17371590 |doi=10.1186/1741-7015-5-3}}</ref> Placebos also do not work as strongly in [[clinical trial]]s because the subjects do not know whether they might be getting a real treatment or a sham one.

In another update by Hróbjartsson & Gøtzsche, published as a 2010 Cochrane systematic review which confirms and modifies their previous work, over 200 trials investigating 60 clinical conditions were included. Placebo interventions were again not found to have important clinical effects in general but may influence patient-reported outcomes in some situations, especially pain and nausea, although it was "difficult to distinguish patient-reported effects of placebo from response bias". The pooled [[relative risk]] they calculated for placebo was 0.93 (effect of only 7%) but [[Statistical significance|significant]]. Effects were also found for phobia and asthma but were uncertain due to high risk of bias. In other conditions involving three or more trials, there was no statistically significant effect for smoking, dementia, depression, obesity, hypertension, insomnia and anxiety, although [[confidence interval]]s were wide. Several clinical (physical placebos, patient-involved outcomes, falsely informing patients there was no placebo) and methodological (small sample size, explicit aim of studying the placebo effect) factors were associated with higher effects of placebo. Despite low effects in general and the risk of bias, the authors acknowledged that large effects of placebo interventions may occur in certain situations.<ref name="PMID 20091554">{{cite journal |author=Hróbjartsson A, Gøtzsche PC |year=2010 |month=January |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=1 | pages=CD003974 |title=Placebo interventions for all clinical conditions |pmid=20091554 |url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD003974/frame.html |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003974.pub3 |editor1-last=Hróbjartsson |editor1-first=Asbjørn}}</ref>

===Negative effects===
Similar to the placebo effect, inert substances have the potential to cause negative effects via the "[[nocebo effect]]" ([[Latin]] ''nocebo'' = "I will harm"). In this effect, giving an inert substance has negative consequences.<ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite web |url=http://priory.com/medicine/Nocebo.htm |title=The Nocebo Effect |publisher=Priory.com |date=10 February 2007 |accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref>

Another negative consequence is that placebos can cause [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]] associated with real treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shapiro AK, Chassan J, Morris LA, Frick R |year=1974 |title=Placebo induced side effects |journal=[[Journal of Operational Psychiatry]] |volume=6 |pages=43–6 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&uid=1977-04006-001 }}</ref> One example of this is with those that have already taken an opiate, can then show [[respiratory depression]] when given it again in the form of a placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benedetti F, Amanzio M, Baldi S, Casadio C, Cavallo A, Mancuso M, Ruffini E, Oliaro A, Maggi G |year=1998 |title=The specific effects of prior opioid exposure on placebo analgesia and placebo respiratory depression |journal=Pain |volume=75 |pages=313–9 |pmid=9583767 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(98)00010-4 |issue=2–3}}</ref>

Withdrawal symptoms can also occur after placebo treatment. This was found, for example, after the discontinuation of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] study of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] for [[menopause]]. Women had been on placebo for an average of 5.7 years. Moderate or severe [[withdrawal]] symptoms were reported by 40.5% of those on placebo compared to 63.3% of those on hormone replacement.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ockene JK, Barad DH, Cochrane BB, Larson JC, Gass M, Wassertheil-Smoller S, Manson JE, Barnabei VM, Lane DS, Brzyski RG, Rosal MC, Wylie-Rosett J, Hays J |year=2005 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/294/2/183 |title=Symptom experience after discontinuing use of estrogen plus progestin |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=294 |pages=183–93 |pmid=16014592 |doi=10.1001/jama.294.2.183 |issue=2}}</ref>

=== Doctor-patient relationship ===
A study of Danish general practitioners found that 48% had prescribed a placebo at least 10 times in the past year.<ref name="H Norup"/> The most frequently prescribed placebos were [[antibiotics]] for [[viral infection]]s, and vitamins for fatigue. Specialists and hospital-based physicians reported much lower rates of placebo use. A 2004 study in the [[British Medical Journal]] of physicians in Israel found that 60% used placebos in their medical practice, most commonly to "fend off" requests for unjustified medications or to calm a patient.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nitzan U, Lichtenberg P |pmc=524103 |title=Questionnaire survey on use of placebo |journal=[[BMJ]] |date=October 23, 2004 |volume=329 |issue=7472 |pages=944–6 |pmid=15377572 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38236.646678.55}}</ref> The accompanying editorial concluded, "We cannot afford to dispense with any treatment that works, even if we are not certain how it does."<ref name=Spiegel>{{cite journal |author=Spiegel D |pmc=524090 |title=Placebos in practice: Doctors use them, they work in some conditions, but we don't know how they work |journal=[[BMJ]] |date=October 23, 2004 |volume=329 |issue=7472 |pages=927–8 |pmid=15499085 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7472.927}}</ref> Other researches have argued that open provision of placebos for treating [[ADHD]] in children can be effective in maintaining ADHD children on lower stimulant doses in the short term.<ref name="Sandler & Bodfish">{{cite journal |author=Sandler AD, Bodfish JW |year=2008 |title=Open-label use of placebos in the treatment of ADHD: a pilot study |journal=[[Child Care Health Dev]] |volume=34 |pages=104–10 |pmid=18171451 |issue=1 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2007.00797.x}}</ref>

Critics of the practice responded that it is unethical to prescribe treatments that do not work, and that telling a patient (as opposed to a research test subject) that a placebo is a real medication is deceptive and harms the doctor-patient relationship in the long run. Critics also argued that using placebos can delay the proper diagnosis and treatment of serious medical conditions.<ref>{{Cite PMID|17285788}}</ref>

The following impracticalities exist with placebos: (See the BMJ posted responses to Spiegel's editorial rapid response online section.<ref name=Spiegel/>)

* Roughly only 30% of the population seems susceptible to placebo effects, and it is not possible to determine ahead of time whether a placebo will work or not. (However the placebo effect is zero in studies of blood poisoning and up to 80% in studies of wound on the duodenum).
* Patients rightfully want immediate relief or improvement from their illness or symptoms. A non-placebo can often provide that, while a placebo might not.
* Legitimate doctors and pharmacists could open themselves up to charges of fraud since sugar pills would cost pennies or cents for a bottle, but the price for a "real" medication would have to be charged to avoid making the patient suspicious.

About 25% of physicians in both the Danish and Israeli studies used placebos as a diagnostic tool to determine if a patient's symptoms were real, or if the patient was [[malingering]]. Both the critics and defenders of the medical use of placebos agreed that this was unethical. The [[British Medical Journal]] editorial said, "That a patient gets pain relief from a placebo does not imply that the pain is not real or organic in origin...the use of the placebo for 'diagnosis' of whether or not pain is real is misguided."

The placebo administration may prove to be a useful treatment in some specific cases where recommended drugs cannot be used. For example, burn patients who are experiencing respiratory problems cannot often be prescribed opioid ([[morphine]]) or opioid derivatives ([[pethidine]]), as these can cause further respiratory depression. In such cases placebo injections (normal saline, etc.) are of use in providing real pain relief to burn patients if those not in delirium are told they are being given a powerful dose of painkiller.

Referring specifically to [[homeopathy]], the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] Science and Technology Committee has stated:{{quote|In the Committee's view, homeopathy is a placebo treatment and the Government should have a policy on prescribing placebos. The Government is reluctant to address the appropriateness and ethics of prescribing placebos to patients, which usually relies on some degree of patient deception. Prescribing of placebos is not consistent with informed patient choice-which the Government claims is very important-as it means patients do not have all the information needed to make choice meaningful.

Beyond ethical issues and the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship, prescribing pure placebos is bad medicine. Their effect is unreliable and unpredictable and cannot form the sole basis of any treatment on the NHS.<ref name=inquiry_cfm/>}}

A survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians came to the result that while 24% of physicians would prescribe a treatment that is a placebo simply because the patient wanted treatment, 58% would not, and for the remaining 18%, it would depend on the circumstances.<ref name=kane>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/731485_7 Doctors Struggle With Tougher-Than-Ever Dilemmas: Other Ethical Issues] Author: Leslie Kane. 11/11/2010</ref>

Though not everyone responds to a placebo, neither does everyone respond to an active drug. The percentage of patients who reported relief following placebo (39%) is similar to the percentage following 4&nbsp;mg (36%) and 6&nbsp;mg (50%) of hidden morphine.<ref name="Levine et al 1981">{{cite journal |author=Levine JD, Gordon NC, Smith R, Fields HL |year=1981 |title=Analgesic responses to morphine and placebo in individuals with postoperative pain |journal=Pain |volume=10 |pages=379–89 |pmid=7279424 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(81)90099-3 |issue=3}}</ref>

===Individual differences===
In the 1950s, there was considerable research to find whether there was a specific [[Personality type|personality]] to those that responded to placebos. The findings could not be replicated<ref>{{cite journal |author=Doongaji DR, Vahia VN, Bharucha MP |year=1978 |title=On placebos, placebo responses and placebo responders.

The desire for relief from pain, "goal [[motivation]]", and how far pain is expected to be relieved increases placebo analgesia.<ref name="Geers et al"/> Another factor increasing the effectiveness of placebos is the degree to which a person attends to their [[symptoms]], "somatic focus".<ref name="autogenerated2006"/> Individual variation in response to analgesic placebos has been linked to regional neurochemical differences in the internal [[Affect (psychology)|affective state]] of the individuals experiencing pain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zubieta JK, Yau WY, Scott DJ, Stohler CS |year=2006 |title=Belief or Need?

Those with [[Alzheimer's disease]] lose the capacity to be influenced by placebos, and this is attributed to the loss of their [[prefrontal cortex]] dependent capacity to have expectations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benedetti F, Arduino C, Costa S, Vighetti S, Tarenzi L, Rainero I, Asteggiano G |year=2006 |title=Loss of expectation-related mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease makes analgesic therapies less effective |journal=Pain |volume=121 |pages=133–44 |pmid=16473462 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2005.12.016 |issue=1–2}}</ref>

===Genes===
In [[social anxiety disorder]] (SAD) an inherited [[allele|variant]] of the gene for [[tryptophan hydroxylase 2]] ([[enzyme]] that synthesizes the neurotransmitter [[serotonin]]) is linked to reduced [[amygdala]] activity and greater susceptibility to the placebo effect.<ref name=pmid19052197>{{cite journal |author=Furmark T, Appel L, Henningsson S, ''et al.'' |title=A link between serotonin-related gene polymorphisms, amygdala activity, and placebo-induced relief from social anxiety |journal=J.

The authors note "additional work is necessary to elucidate the generalizability of the findings".

In a 2012 study, variations on the [[COMT]] (catechol-O-methyltransferase) [[gene]] related to [[dopamine]] release are found to be critical in the placebo effect among the patients with [[irritable bowel syndrome]] participating in the trial, a research group in [[Harvard Medical School]] reported.  Patients with a variation of met/met, for having two copies of the [[methionine]] [[allele]] were shown to be more likely to respond to the placebo treatment, while the variation of val/val, for their two copies of [[valine]] allele responded the least.  The response of patients with one copy each of methionine and valine fell in the middle.  Release of dopamine in patients with the met/met variations is thought to link to reward and 'confirmation bias' which enhance the sense that the treatment is working.   The role of the COMT gene variations are expected to be more prominent in studies where patients report more subjective conditions such as pain and fatigue rather than objective physiological measurements.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/genetics-may-help-explain-placebo-effect-researchers-say.html|title=Genetics May Help Explain Placebo Effect, Researchers Say|author=Tirrell, Meg|publisher=Bloomberg|date=24 October 2012|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Kathryn|last2=Lembo|first2=Anthony|last3=Kirsch|first3=Irving|last4=Ziogas|first4=Dimitrios|last5=Douaiher|first5=Jeffrey|last6=Jensen|first6=Karin|last7=Conboy|first7=Lisa|last8=Kelley|first8=John|last9=Kaptchuk|first9=Ted|title=Catechol-O-Methyltransferase val158met Polymorphism Predicts Placebo Effect in Irritable Bowel Syndrome|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|volume=7|issue=10|page=e48135|year=2012|publisher=[[PLOS]]|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0048135|url= http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0048135|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref>

==Symptoms and conditions==
The placebo effect occurs more strongly in some conditions than others. [[Dylan Evans]] has suggested that placebos work most strongly upon conditions such as pain, swelling, stomach ulcers, depression, and anxiety that have been linked with activation of the [[Acute-phase reaction|acute-phase response]].<ref name="Evans">{{cite book |author=Evans, Dylan |title=Placebo: the belief effect |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-00-712612-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

=== Pain ===
The placebo effect is believed to reduce pain in two different ways. One way is by the placebo initiating the release of [[endorphins]], which are natural pain killers produced by the brain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cousins |first=Norman |title=Head First |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |year=1989 |publisher=E. P. Dutton |location=New York |pages=229–231}}</ref> The other way is the placebo changing the patient's perception of pain. "A person might reinterpret a sharp pain as uncomfortable tingling."<ref>http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/placebo-effect</ref> 

Placebo analgesia is more likely to work the more severe the pain.<ref>{{Cite PMID|291020}}</ref> One study found that for [[Pain#Management|postoperative pain]] following the extraction of the third molar, saline injected while telling the patient it was a powerful painkiller was as potent as a 6–8&nbsp;mg dose of [[morphine]].<ref name="Levine et al 1981"/> 
Most research reports average reduction for a group of people, but this can be lower (some people do not respond). In one study using injection of [[capsaicin]] below the skin found that this reduced group average pain compared to no placebo by ~46% to ~57%.<ref name="Benedetti opioid"/> Another measure is the ability to endure pain.

In 1998, a [[meta-analysis]] of published antidepressant trials found that 75% of the effectiveness of anti-depressant medication is due to the placebo effect and other non-specific effects, rather than the treatment itself.<ref name="autogenerated1998">Kirsch, I.

A 2002 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' titled "Against Depression, a Sugar Pill Is Hard to Beat" summarized research as follows:<blockquote>In the majority of trials conducted by drug companies in recent decades, sugar pills have done as well as -- or better than -- antidepressants. Companies have had to conduct numerous trials to get two that show a positive result, which is the Food and Drug Administration's minimum for approval. The makers of Prozac had to run five trials to obtain two that were positive, and the makers of Paxil and Zoloft had to run even more.<ref name="WaPo 2002"/></blockquote>

===Gastric and duodenal ulcers===
A [[meta-study]] of 31 placebo-controlled trials of the [[gastric acid]] secretion inhibitor drug [[cimetidine]] in the treatment of gastric or duodenal ulcers found that placebo treatments, in many cases, were as effective as active drugs: of the 1692 patients treated in the 31 trials, 76% of the 916 treated with the drug were "healed", and 48% of the 776 treated with placebo were "healed".<ref name="Moerman2002"/><ref name="Moerman book">{{cite book| last=Moerman| first=Daniel E.| title= Meaning, Medicine and the Placebo Effect| publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]| year= 2002| isbn=0-521-80630-5| issn= 978-0521000871}}</ref> These results were confirmed by the direct post-treatment [[endoscopy]]. It was also found that German placebos were "stronger" than others; and that, overall, different physicians evoked quite different placebo responses in the same clinical trial.<ref name="Moerman book"/>{{rp|15}} Moreover, in many of these trials the gap between the active drugs and the placebo controls was "not because [the trials' constituents] had high drug effectiveness, but because they had low placebo effectiveness".<ref name="Moerman book"/>{{rp|13}}

In some trials, placebos were effective in 90% of the cases, whereas in others the placebos were effective in only 10% of the cases. It was argued that "what is demonstrated in [these] studies is not enhanced healing in drug groups but reduced healing in placebo groups".<ref name="Moerman book"/>{{rp|14}} It was also noted the results of two studies (one conducted in Germany, the other in Denmark), which examined "ulcer [[relapse]] in healed patients" showed that the rate of relapse amongst those "healed" by the active drug treatment was ''five times'' that of those "healed" by the placebo treatment.<ref name="Moerman book"/>{{rp|14-15}}

===Chronic fatigue syndrome===
It was previously assumed that placebo response rates in patients with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] (CFS) are unusually high, "at least 30% to 50%", because of the subjective reporting of symptoms and the fluctuating nature of the condition. According to a meta-analysis and contrary to conventional wisdom, the pooled response rate in the placebo group was 19.6%, even lower than in some other medical conditions. The authors offer possible explanations for this result: CFS is widely understood to be difficult to treat, which could reduce expectations of improvement. In context of evidence showing placebos do not have powerful clinical effects when compared to no treatment, a low rate of spontaneous remission in CFS could contribute to reduced improvement rates in the placebo group. Intervention type also contributed to the heterogeneity of the response. Low patient and provider expectations regarding psychological treatment may explain particularly low placebo responses to psychiatric treatments.<ref name="PMID 15784798">{{cite journal | author = Cho HJ, Hotopf M, Wessely S | title = The placebo response in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis| journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 301–13| year = 2005 | pmid = 15784798| url = http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/67/2/301.pdf | accessdate = 2008-12-12 | doi = 10.1097/01.psy.0000156969.76986.e0}}</ref>

==Effects on research==

===Placebo-controlled studies===
{{Main| Placebo-controlled studies }}

The placebo effect makes it more difficult to evaluate new treatments. Apparent benefits of a new treatment (usually a drug but not necessarily so) may not derive from the treatment but from the placebo effect. This is particularly likely, given that new therapies seem to have greater placebo effects.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Clinical trials control for this effect by including a group of subjects that receives a sham treatment. The subjects in such trials are blinded as to whether they receive the treatment or a placebo. Clinical trials are often double-blinded so that the researchers also do not know which test subjects are receiving the active or placebo treatment.

The placebo effect in such clinical trials is weaker than in normal therapy since the subjects are not sure whether the treatment they are receiving is active.<ref name="autogenerated2003"/>

Knowingly giving a person a placebo when there is an effective treatment available is a bioethically complex issue. While placebo-controlled trials might provide information about the effectiveness of a treatment, it denies some patients what could be the best available (if unproven) treatment. [[Informed consent]] is usually required for a study to be considered ethical, including the disclosure that some test subjects will receive placebo treatments.

The ethics of placebo-controlled studies have been debated in the revision process of the [[Declaration of Helsinki]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Am J Bioethics]] |pages=34–48 |date=25 Aug 2009 |title=Questioning the Methodologic Superiority of 'Placebo' over 'Active' Controlled Trials |author=Howick J |pmid=19998192 |volume=9 |issue=9 |doi=10.1080/15265160903090041}}</ref> Of particular concern has been the difference between trials comparing inert placebos with experimental treatments, versus comparing the best available treatment with an experimental treatment; and differences between trials in the sponsor's developed countries versus the trial's targeted developing countries.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[J Eval Clin Pract]] |pages=1041–4 |date=21 July 2010 |title=The improper use of research placebos |author=Kottow M |pmid= 20663001 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2753.2009.01246.x |volume=16 |issue=6}}</ref>

A further issue of concern to pharmaceutical companies is that the effectiveness of placebos has increased over time,<ref>[http://www.wired.com/medtech/drugs/magazine/17-09/ff_placebo_effect?currentPage=all Placebos Are Getting More Effective. Drugmakers Are Desperate to Know Why]</ref> thus making it more difficult to demonstrate the effectiveness of new drugs. The reason for the increased effectiveness is disputed.

===Nocebo===
{{Main|Nocebo}}
In the opposite effect, a patient who disbelieves in a treatment may experience a worsening of symptoms. This effect, now called by analogy [[nocebo]] ([[Latin]] ''nocebo'' = "I shall harm") can be measured in the same way as the placebo effect, e.g., when members of a control group receiving an inert substance report a worsening of symptoms. The recipients of the inert substance may nullify the placebo effect intended by simply having a negative attitude towards the effectiveness of the substance prescribed, which often leads to a nocebo effect, which is not caused by the substance, but due to other factors, such as the patient's [[mentality]] towards his or her ability to get well, or even purely coincidental worsening of symptoms.<ref name="autogenerated4"/>

===Placebo ingredients===
Placebos used in clinical trials have sometimes had unintended consequences. A report in the Annals of Internal Medicine that looked at details from 150 clinical trials found that certain placebos used in the trials affected the results. For example, one study on cholesterol-lowering drugs used [[olive oil]] and [[corn oil]] in the placebo pills. However, according to the report, this "may lead to an understatement of drug benefit: The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids of these 'placebos,' and their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, can reduce lipid levels and heart disease." Another example researchers reported in the study was a clinical trial of a new therapy for cancer patients suffering from [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]]. The placebo that was used included [[lactose]]. However, since cancer patients typically face a higher risk of [[lactose intolerance]], the placebo pill might actually have caused unintended side-effects that made the experimental drug look better in comparison.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Golomb BA, Erickson LC, Koperski S, Sack D, Enkin M, Howick J |title=What's in placebos: who knows?
