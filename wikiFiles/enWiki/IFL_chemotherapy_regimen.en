'''IFL''' is a [[chemotherapy regimen]] for treatment of certain cancers, consisting of concurrent treatment with [[irinotecan]], [[leucovorin]] (folinic acid), and [[fluorouracil]].

It is similar to the [[FOLFIRI]] regimen and uses the same drugs. However, the flurouracil component is given as a bolus injection rather than as an infusion over 48 hours.
