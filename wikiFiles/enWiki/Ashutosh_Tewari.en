==Robotic prostatectomy==
With the introduction of the [[da Vinci Surgical System]], the advent of [[robotic surgery]] using a [[laparoscopic]] approach has significantly changed the way [[prostate cancer]] [[surgery]] and [[prostatectomy]] procedures in general are performed as compared to the traditional 'open' methodology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leechvideo.com/video/view1515613.html |title=Robotic Prostatectomy: Cornell Athermal Robotic Technique |publisher=Leechvideo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.usti.net/home/news/cn/?/tw.misc/2/wed/by/Uus-prostatesurgery-briefing.RUwJ_HyE.html |title=Procedure Minimizes Prostate Incontinence |publisher=News.usti.net |date=2007-05-14 |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref> Much of Tewari's research projects serve to promote robotic surgery as opposed to open procedures. For example, Tewari has shown that the operating field has become more visible to the surgeon, unobscured by the copious amounts of blood encountered in traditional surgery and is thus able to view the urological structures under [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]], enlarged magnification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/489212 |title=Robotic Prostatectomy - A Review |publisher=Medscape.com |date=2004-10-25 |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref> Patients reap even greater benefits.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16280816 |year=2005 |last1=Menon |first1=M |last2=Kaul |last3=Bhandari |last4=Shrivastava |last5=Tewari |last6=Hemal |title=Potency following robotic radical prostatectomy: a questionnaire based analysis of outcomes after conventional nerve sparing and prostatic fascia sparing techniques |volume=174 |issue=6 |pages=2291–6, discussion 2296 |doi=10.1097/01.ju.0000181825.54480.eb |journal=The Journal of Urology |first2=S |first3=A |first4=A |first5=A |first6=A}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12187196 |year=2002 |last1=Menon |first1=M |last2=Shrivastava |last3=Tewari |last4=Sarle |last5=Hemal |last6=Peabody |last7=Vallancien |title=Laparoscopic and robot assisted radical prostatectomy: establishment of a structured program and preliminary analysis of outcomes |doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(05)64548-X,|volume=168 |issue=3 |pages=945–9 |journal=The Journal of Urology  |first2=A |first3=A |first4=R |first5=A |first6=JO |first7=G}}</ref> Due to the [[minimally invasive]] nature of the procedure, they experience minimized pain, minimized blood loss, less [[scarring]] and fewer complications.
