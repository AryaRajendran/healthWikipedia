A '''urinary tract infection''' ('''UTI''') is an [[infection]] that affects part of the [[Urinary system|urinary tract]].  When it affects the lower urinary tract it is known as a simple [[cystitis]] (a bladder infection) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as [[pyelonephritis]] (a kidney infection).<!-- <ref name=EM2011/> --> Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include painful [[urination]] and either frequent urination or urge to urinate (or both), while those of pyelonephritis include [[fever]] and [[Abdominal pain|flank pain]] in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. In the elderly and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non specific. The main causal agent of both types is ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', however other bacteria, [[virus]]es or [[fungi]] may rarely be the cause.

Urinary tract infections occur more commonly in women than men, with half of women having at least one infection at some point in their lives. Recurrences are common. Risk factors include female anatomy, sexual intercourse and family history. Pyelonephritis, if it occurs, usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a [[bacteremia|blood borne infection]]. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection. In complicated cases or if treatment has failed, a [[urine culture]] may be useful. In those with frequent infections, low dose [[antibiotic]]s may be taken as a preventative measure.

In uncomplicated cases, urinary tract infections are easily treated with a short course of antibiotics, although [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to many of the antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed, and if symptoms have not improved in two or three days, further diagnostic testing is needed. In women, urinary tract infections are the most common form of bacterial infection with 10% developing urinary tract infections yearly.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Pyuria2011.JPG|thumb|Urine may contain pus (a condition known as [[pyuria]]) as seen from a person with [[sepsis]] due to a urinary tract infection.]]
Lower urinary tract infection is also referred to as a bladder infection.  The most common symptoms are [[dysuria|burning with urination]] and having to urinate frequently (or an urge to urinate) in the absence of [[vaginal discharge]] and significant pain.<ref name=Review08/> These symptoms may vary from mild to severe<ref name=EM2011>{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=DR|coauthors=Takhar, SS|title=Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis.|journal=Emergency medicine clinics of North America|date=2011 Aug|volume=29|issue=3|pages=539–52|pmid=21782073|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2011.04.001}}</ref> and in healthy women last an average of six&nbsp;days.<ref name=AFP2011/> Some pain above the [[pubic bone]] or in the [[lower back pain|lower back]] may be present.<!-- <ref name=EM2011/> --> People experiencing an upper urinary tract infection, or [[pyelonephritis]], may experience [[abdominal pain|flank pain]], [[fever]], or nausea and [[vomiting]] in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection.<ref name=EM2011/> Rarely the urine may appear bloody<ref name=Sal2011/> or contain visible [[pyuria]] (pus in the urine).<ref>{{cite book|last=Arellano|first=Ronald S.|title=Non-vascular interventional radiology of the abdomen|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-7731-1|page=67|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=au-OpXwnibMC&pg=PA67}}</ref>

===Children===
In young children, the only symptom of a urinary tract infection (UTI) may be a fever.<!-- <ref name=PeadsNA2011/>  -->  Because of the lack of more obvious symptoms, when females under the age of two or uncircumcised males less than a year exhibit a fever, a culture of the urine is recommended by many medical associations.<!-- <ref name=PeadsNA2011/>  --> Infants may feed poorly, vomit, sleep more, or show signs of [[jaundice]].<!-- <ref name=PeadsNA2011/>  --> In older children, new onset [[urinary incontinence]] (loss of bladder control) may occur.<ref name=PeadsNA2011/>

===Elderly===
Urinary tract symptoms are frequently lacking in the [[Old age|elderly]].<ref name=Elder2011/> The presentations may be vague with incontinence, a [[Altered level of consciousness|change in mental status]], or fatigue as the only symptoms,<ref name=EM2011/> while some present to a health care provider with [[sepsis]], an infection of the blood, as the first symptoms.<ref name=Sal2011/> Diagnosis can be complicated by the fact that many elderly people have preexisting incontinence or [[dementia]].<ref name=Elder2011/>

==Cause==
''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' is the cause of 80–85% of urinary tract infections, with ''[[Staphylococcus saprophyticus]]'' being the cause in 5–10%.<ref name=Review08/> Rarely they may be due to [[Virus|viral]] or [[fungal]] infections.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Amdekar|first=S|coauthors=Singh, V, Singh, DD|title=Probiotic therapy: immunomodulating approach toward urinary tract infection.|journal=Current microbiology|date=2011 Nov|volume=63|issue=5|pages=484–90|pmid=21901556|doi=10.1007/s00284-011-0006-2}}</ref> Other bacterial causes include: ''[[Klebsiella]]'', ''[[Proteus bacteria|Proteus]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', and ''[[Enterobacter]]''.  These are uncommon and typically related to abnormalities of the urinary system or [[urinary catheterization]].<ref name=Sal2011/> Urinary tract infections due to ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections.<ref name=EM2011/>

===Sex===
In young sexually active women, sexual activity is the cause of 75–90% of bladder infections, with the risk of infection related to the frequency of sex.<ref name=Review08>{{cite journal|author=Nicolle LE|title=Uncomplicated urinary tract infection in adults including uncomplicated pyelonephritis|journal=Urol Clin North Am|volume=35|issue=1|pages=1–12, v|year=2008|pmid=18061019|doi=10.1016/j.ucl.2007.09.004}}</ref> The term "honeymoon cystitis" has been applied to this phenomenon of frequent UTIs during early marriage. In [[Menopause|post-menopausal]] women, sexual activity does not affect the risk of developing a UTI.<!-- <ref name=Review08/> --> [[Spermicide]] use, independent of sexual frequency, increases the risk of UTIs.<ref name=Review08/>

Women are more prone to UTIs than men because, in females, the [[urethra]] is much shorter and closer to the [[anus]].<ref name=NA2011>{{cite journal|last=Dielubanza|first=EJ|coauthors=Schaeffer, AJ|title=Urinary tract infections in women.|journal=The Medical clinics of North America|date=2011 Jan|volume=95|issue=1|pages=27–41|pmid=21095409|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2010.08.023}}</ref> As a woman's estrogen levels decrease with [[menopause]], her risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective [[vaginal flora]].<ref name=NA2011/>

===Urinary catheters===
[[Catheter|Urinary catheterization]] increases the risk for urinary tract infections.<!-- <ref name=NA2011/> --> The risk of [[bacteriuria]] (bacteria in the urine) is between three to six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections.<ref name=NA2011/> The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using [[aseptic technique]] for insertion, and maintaining unobstructed closed drainage of the catheter.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nicolle LE|title=The chronic indwelling catheter and urinary infection in long-term-care facility residents|journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol|volume=22|issue=5|pages=316–21|year=2001|pmid=11428445|doi=10.1086/501908}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Phipps S, Lim YN, McClinton S, Barry C, Rane A, N'Dow J|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=|issue=2|pages=CD004374|year=2006|pmid=16625600|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004374.pub2|editor1-last=Phipps|editor1-first=Simon|chapter=Short term urinary catheter policies following urogenital surgery in adults}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Gould CV, Umscheid CA, Agarwal RK, Kuntz G, Pegues DA|title=Guideline for prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections 2009|journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol|volume=31|issue=4|pages=319–26|year=2010|pmid=20156062|doi=10.1086/651091}}</ref>

Male [[scuba divers]] utilizing [[External urine collection devices#Texas catheter|condom catheters]] or the female divers utilizing She-p external catching device for their [[dry suit]]s are also susceptible to urinary tract infections.<ref name="pmid22752741">{{cite journal |author=Harris, Richard |title=Genitourinary infection and barotrauma as complications of 'P-valve' use in drysuit divers |journal=Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine : the Journal of the [[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=210–2 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=22752741 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/9482 |accessdate=2013-04-04}}</ref><ref name="She-P">{{cite web |title=She-P: The Female P-Valve Catheter |publisher=She-P |url=http://www.she-p.com/ |accessdate=2009-03-08 }}</ref>

===Others===
A predisposition for bladder infections may run in families.<!-- <ref name=Review08/> --> Other risk factors include [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]],<ref name=Review08/> being [[circumcise|uncircumcised]], and having a [[benign prostatic hypertrophy|large prostate]].<ref name=EM2011/> Complicating factors are rather vague and include predisposing anatomic, functional, or metabolic abnormalities.<!-- <ref name=bryan/> --> A complicated UTI is more difficult to treat and usually requires more aggressive evaluation, treatment and follow-up.<ref name=bryan>[http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/infectious%20disease/Urinary%20Tract%20Infections.htm Infectious Disease, Chapter Seven, Urinary Tract Infections] from ''Infectious Disease Section of Microbiology and Immunology On-line''.

Persons with [[spinal cord injury]] are at increased risk for urinary tract infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of [[urination|voiding]] dysfunction.<ref name=Spine2010>{{cite journal|last=Eves|first=FJ|coauthors=Rivera, N|title=Prevention of urinary tract infections in persons with spinal cord injury in home health care.|journal=Home healthcare nurse|date=2010 Apr|volume=28|issue=4|pages=230–41|pmid=20520263|doi=10.1097/NHH.0b013e3181dc1bcb}}</ref> It is the most common cause of infection in this population, as well as the most common cause of hospitalization.<ref name=Spine2010/> Additionally, use of [[cranberry juice]] or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Opperman|first=EA|title=Cranberry is not effective for the prevention or treatment of urinary tract infections in individuals with spinal cord injury.|journal=Spinal cord|date=2010 Jun|volume=48|issue=6|pages=451–6|pmid=19935757|doi=10.1038/sc.2009.159}}</ref>

==Pathogenesis==
The [[bacteria]] that cause urinary tract infections typically enter the bladder via the urethra. However, infection may also occur via the blood or [[lymph]].<!-- <ref name=Sal2011/> --> It is believed that the bacteria are usually transmitted to the urethra from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy.<!-- <ref name=Sal2011/> --> After gaining entry to the bladder, ''E. Coli'' are able to attach to the bladder wall and form a [[biofilm]] that resists the body's immune response.<ref name=Sal2011/>

==Prevention==

A number of measures have not been confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or [[defecating]], or whether a person typically bathes or showers.<ref name=Review08/> There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, [[tampon]] use, and douching.<ref name=NA2011/> In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use [[spermicide]] or a [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] as a method of contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods.<ref name=Sal2011/> Condom use without [[spermicide]] or use of [[birth control pills]] does not increase the risk of uncomplicated urinated tract infection.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Engleberg|first1= N C|authorlink1= |last2= DiRita|first2=V | last3=Dermody | first3=T S | authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first=|editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Schaechter's Mechanism of Microbial Disease|trans_title= |url= |archiveurl=|archivedate= |accessdate= |type= |edition=4 |series= |volume= |date= |year= 2007 |month= |origyear= |publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location= Baltimore|isbn=978-0-7817-5342-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |at=618|trans_chapter= |chapter= 63|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript=|lastauthoramp=}}</ref><ref name=Review08/> 

===Medications===
For those with recurrent infections, a prolonged course of daily antibiotics is effective.<ref name=Review08/> Medications frequently used include [[nitrofurantoin]] and [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=Sal2011/> [[Methenamine]] is another agent frequently used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces [[formaldehyde]] to which resistance does not develop.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cubeddu|first=Richard Finkel, Michelle A.

As of 2011, intravaginal [[probiotics]] require further study to determine if they are beneficial.<ref name=Sal2011/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Bacteriuria pyuria 4.jpg|thumb|Multiple [[bacilli]] (rod-shaped bacteria, here shown as black and bean-shaped) shown between white blood cells in urinary microscopy. These changes are indicative of a urinary tract infection.]]
In straightforward cases, a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation.<!-- <ref name=Review08/> --> In complicated or questionable cases, it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via [[urinalysis]], looking for the presence of [[urinary nitrite]]s, [[white blood cells]] (leukocytes), or [[leukocyte esterase]].  Another test, [[urine microscopy]], looks for the presence of [[red blood cells]], white blood cells, or bacteria.<!-- <ref name=Review08/> --> Urine [[microbiological culture|culture]] is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 10<sup>3</sup> [[colony-forming unit]]s per mL of a typical urinary tract organism.<!-- <ref name=Review08/> --> Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment.<!-- <ref name=Review08/> --> However, women with negative cultures may still improve with antibiotic treatment.<ref name=Review08/> As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.<ref name=Elder2011/>

===Classification===
A urinary tract infection may involve only the lower urinary tract, in which case it is known as a bladder infection.  Alternatively, it may involve the upper urinary tract, in which case it is known as pyelonephritis.<!-- <ref name=EM2011/> --> If the urine contains significant bacteria but there are no symptoms, the condition is known as asymptomatic bacteriuria.<ref name=EM2011/> If a urinary tract infection involves the upper tract, and the person has [[diabetes mellitus]], is pregnant, is male, or [[immunocompromised]], it is considered complicated.<ref name=AFP2011/><ref name=Sal2011/> Otherwise if a woman is healthy and [[premenopausal]] it is considered uncomplicated.<ref name=AFP2011/> In children when a urinary tract infection is associated with a fever, it is deemed to be an upper urinary tract infection.<ref name=PeadsNA2011>{{cite journal|last=Bhat|first=RG|coauthors=Katy, TA, Place, FC|title=Pediatric urinary tract infections.|journal=Emergency medicine clinics of North America|date=2011 Aug|volume=29|issue=3|pages=637–53|pmid=21782079|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2011.04.004}}</ref>

===Children===
To make the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection in children, a positive urinary culture is required.<!-- <ref name=PeadsNA2011/> --> Contamination poses a frequent challenge depending on the method of collection used, thus a cutoff of 10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;CFU/mL is used for a "clean-catch" mid stream sample, 10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;CFU/mL is used for catheter-obtained specimens, and 10<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;CFU/mL is used for [[suprapubic aspiration]]s (a sample drawn directly from the bladder with a needle).<!-- <ref name=PeadsNA2011/> --> The use of "urine bags" to collect samples is discouraged by the [[World Health Organization]] due to the high rate of contamination when cultured, and catheterization is preferred in those not toilet trained.<!-- <ref name=PeadsNA2011/> --> Some, such as the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends [[renal ultrasound]] and [[voiding cystourethrogram]] (watching a person's urethra and urinary bladder with real time x-rays while they urinate) in all children less than two year old who have had a urinary tract infection.<!-- <ref name=PeadsNA2011/> --> However, because there is a lack of effective treatment if problems are found, others such as the [[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] only recommends routine imaging in those less than six month old or who have unusual findings.<ref name=PeadsNA2011/>

===Differential diagnosis===
In women with [[cervicitis]] (inflammation of the [[cervix]]) or [[vaginitis]] (inflammation of the [[vagina]]) and in young men with UTI symptoms, a ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' or ''[[Neisseria gonorrheae]]'' infection may be the cause.<ref name=EM2011/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Raynor|first=MC|coauthors=Carson CC, 3rd|title=Urinary infections in men.|journal=The Medical clinics of North America|date=2011 Jan|volume=95|issue=1|pages=43–54|pmid=21095410|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2010.08.015}}</ref> Vaginitis may also be due to a [[candidal vulvovaginitis|yeast infection]].<ref name=Book2011>{{cite book|last=Leung|first=David Hui ; edited by Alexander|title=Approach to internal medicine : a resource book for clinical practice|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-6504-2|page=244|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=lnXNpj5ZzKMC&pg=PA244|edition=3rd ed.|coauthors=Padwal, Raj}}</ref> [[Interstitial cystitis]] (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kursh|first=edited by Elroy D.|title=Office urology|year=2000|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=978-0-89603-789-2|page=131|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=AdYs-QwU8KQC&pg=PA131|coauthors=Ulchaker, James C.}}</ref> [[Prostatitis]] (inflammation of the [[prostate]]) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walls|first=authors, Nathan W.

==Treatment==
The mainstay of treatment is [[antibiotic]]s. [[Phenazopyridine]] is occasionally prescribed during the first few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gaines|first=KK|title=Phenazopyridine hydrochloride: the use and abuse of an old standby for UTI.|journal=Urologic nursing|date=2004 Jun|volume=24|issue=3|pages=207–9|pmid=15311491}}</ref> However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of [[methemoglobinemia]] (higher than normal level of [[methemoglobin]] in the blood).<ref>{{cite book|last=Aronson|first=edited by Jeffrey K.|title=Meyler's side effects of analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-444-53273-2|page=219|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=2WxotnWiiWkC&pg=PA219}}</ref> [[Acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) may be used for fevers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Glass|first=[edited by] Jill C.

Women with recurrent simple UTIs may benefit from self-treatment upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow-up only if the initial treatment fails.<!-- <ref name=Review08/> --> A prescription for antibiotics can be delivered to a pharmacist by phone.<ref name=Review08/>

Urinary tract infections may affect 10% of people during childhood.<ref name=Sal2011/> Among children urinary tract infections are the most common in uncircumcised males less than three months of age, followed by females less than one year.<ref name=PeadsNA2011/> Estimates of frequency among children however vary widely. In a group of children with a fever, ranging in age between birth and two years, two to 20% were diagnosed with a UTI.<ref name=PeadsNA2011/>

==Society and culture==
In the United States, urinary tract infections account for nearly seven million office visits, a million emergency department visits, and one hundred thousand hospitalizations every year.<ref name=Sal2011/> The cost of these infections is significant both in terms of lost time at work and costs of medical care.<!-- <ref name=Nurse10/> --> In the United States the direct cost of treatment is estimated at 1.6&nbsp;billion&nbsp;USD yearly.<ref name=Nurse2010/>

==History==
Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the [[Ebers Papyrus]] dated to c. 1550 BC.<ref name=His2008>{{cite book|last=Al-Achi|first=Antoine|title=An introduction to botanical medicines : history, science, uses, and dangers|year=2008|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-35009-2|page=126|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=HMzxKua4_rcC&pg=PA126}}</ref> It was described by the Egyptians as "sending forth heat from the bladder".<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson...]|first=[general ed.: Graham|title=Topley and Wilson's Principles of bacteriology, virology and immunity : in 4 volumes|year=1990|publisher=Arnold|location=London|isbn=0-7131-4591-9|page=198|edition=8. ed.}}</ref> Effective treatment did not occur until the development and availability of antibiotics in the 1930s before which time herbs, [[bloodletting]] and rest were recommended.<ref name=His2008/>

==Pregnancy==
Urinary tract infections are more concerning in [[pregnancy]] due to the increased risk of kidney infections.<!-- <ref name=NA2011/> --> During pregnancy, high [[progesterone]] levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, which leads to a greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys.<!-- <ref name=NA2011/> --> While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25-40% risk of a kidney infection.<ref name=NA2011/> Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended.<!-- <ref name=Preg10/> --> [[Cephalexin]] or [[nitrofurantoin]] are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy.<ref name=Preg10>{{cite journal|author=Guinto VT, De Guia B, Festin MR, Dowswell T|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=|issue=9|pages=CD007855|year=2010|pmid=20824868|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007855.pub2|editor1-last=Guinto|editor1-first=Valerie T|chapter=Different antibiotic regimens for treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy}}</ref> A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in [[premature birth]] or [[pre-eclampsia]] (a state of [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to [[seizures]]).<ref name=NA2011/>
