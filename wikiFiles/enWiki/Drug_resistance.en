{{mergefrom|Multiple drug resistance|date=September 2012}}
'''Drug resistance''' is the reduction in effectiveness of a drug such as an [[antimicrobial]] or an [[antineoplastic]]<ref>{{MeshName|Drug+Resistance}}</ref> in curing a [[disease]] or condition. When the drug is not intended to kill or inhibit a [[pathogen]], then the term is equivalent to ''dosage failure'' or [[drug tolerance]]. More commonly, the term is used in the context of resistance that [[pathogen]]s have "acquired", that is, resistance has evolved. When an organism is resistant to more than one drug, it is said to be [[multidrug resistance|multidrug-resistant]]. In a broad sense the immune system of an organism is such a drug delivery system, albeit autonomous, and faces the same [[arms race]] problems as external drug delivery. 

The development of antibiotic resistance in particular stems from the drugs targeting only specific bacterial proteins. Because the drug ''is'' so specific, any mutation in these proteins will interfere with or negate its destructive effect, resulting in antibiotic resistance.<ref>http://www.detectingdesign.com/antibioticresistance.html</ref> 

Bacteria are capable of not only altering the enzyme targeted by antibiotics, but also by the use of enzymes to modify the antibiotic itself and thus neutralise it. Examples of target-altering pathogens are ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', vancomycin-resistant [[enterococci]] and macrolide-resistant ''[[Streptococcus]]'', while examples of antibiotic-modifying microbes are ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and aminoglycoside-resistant ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]''.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/B978-008045382-8.00161-1}}</ref>

Resistance to chemicals is only one aspect of the problem, another being resistance to physical factors such as temperature, pressure, sound, radiation and magnetism, and not discussed in this article, but found at [[Physical factors affecting microbial life]].

==Introduction==
Drug or toxin or chemical resistance is a consequence of [[evolution]] and is a response to pressures imposed on any living organism. Individual organisms vary in their sensitivity to the drug used and some with greater [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] may be capable of surviving drug treatment.  Drug-resistant traits are accordingly inherited by subsequent offspring, resulting in a population that is more drug-resistant. Unless the drug used makes sexual reproduction or [[Mitosis|cell-division]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]] impossible in the entire target population, resistance to the drug will inevitably follow. This can be seen in [[cancer]]ous tumors where some cells may develop resistance to the drugs used in [[chemotherapy]].<ref>http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/drugs/factors_affecting_response_to_drugs/tolerance_and_resistance_to_drugs.html</ref> Chemotherapy causes [[fibroblasts]] near [[tumor]]s to produce large amounts of the protein [[WNT16|WNT16B]]. This protein stimulates the growth of cancer cells which are drug-resistant.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19111700 "Chemo 'Undermines Itself' Through Rogue Response"],''BBC News'', 5 August 2012.</ref> [[Malaria]] in 2012 has become a resurgent threat in [[South East Asia]] and [[sub-Saharan Africa]], and drug-resistant strains of ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' are posing massive problems for health authorities. <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17628172 BBC News]</ref> [[Leprosy]] has shown an increasing resistance to [[dapsone]].

A rapid process of sharing resistance exists among [[Unicellular organism|single-celled organism]]s, and is termed horizontal gene transfer in which there is a direct exchange of genes, particularly in the [[biofilm]] state.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12849777|year=2003|last1=Molin|first1=S|last2=Tolker-Nielsen|first2=T|title=Gene transfer occurs with enhanced efficiency in biofilms and induces enhanced stabilisation of the biofilm structure|volume=14|issue=3|pages=255–61|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(03)00036-3}}</ref> A similar asexual method is used by [[fungi]] and is called "[[parasexuality]]".

"The use and misuse of antimicrobials in human medicine and animal husbandry over the past 70 years has led to a relentless rise in the number and types of microorganisms resistant to these medicines - leading to death, increased suffering and disability, and higher healthcare costs." - [http://www.who.int/drugresistance/en/ World Health Organisation 2010]

"Deaths from acute respiratory infections, [[diarrhoeal diseases]], [[measles]], [[AIDS]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]] account for more than 85% of the mortality from infection worldwide. Resistance to first-line drugs in most of the pathogens causing these diseases ranges from zero to almost 100%. In some instances resistance to second- and thirdline agents is seriously compromising treatment outcome. Added to this is the significant global burden of resistant, hospital-acquired infections, the emerging problems of antiviral resistance and the increasing problems of drug resistance in the neglected parasitic diseases of poor and marginalized populations." - [http://www.who.int/drugresistance/WHO_Global_Strategy_English.pdf WHO Global Strategy for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance 2010]

==Mechanisms==
The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are: 
# Drug inactivation or modification: e.g., enzymatic deactivation of [[Penicillin|''Penicillin'' G]] in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamases]].
# Alteration of target site: e.g., alteration of [[Penicillin-binding protein|PBP]] — the binding target site of penicillins — in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and  other penicillin-resistant bacteria.
# Alteration of metabolic pathway: e.g., some [[sulfa drugs|sulfonamide]]-resistant bacteria do not require [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of [[folic acid]] and [[nucleic acids]] in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides. Instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to utilizing preformed folic acid.
# Reduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] and/or increasing active [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface.<ref name= "pmid19678712">{{cite journal |author= Li, X, Nikadio H |title = Efflux-Mediated Drug Resistance in Bacteria: an Update| journal = Drug | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 1555–623| year = 2009 | pmid = 19678712 |  doi = 10.2165/11317030-000000000-00000| url = |pmc= 2847397 }}</ref>

==Metabolic price==
''Biological cost'' or ''[[metabolic price]]'' is a measure of the increased [[energy metabolism]] required to achieve a function.

Drug resistance has a high metabolic price<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0966-842X(97)01101-3}}</ref> in pathogens for which this concept is relevant (bacteria,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wichelhaus TA, Böddinghaus B, Besier S, Schäfer V, Brade V, Ludwig A |title=Biological Cost of Rifampin Resistance from the Perspective of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=46 |issue=11 |pages=3381–5 |year=2002 |pmid=12384339|doi=10.1128/AAC.46.11.3381-3385.2002 |pmc=128759}}</ref> endoparasites, and tumor cells.) In viruses, an equivalent "cost" is genomic complexity.

==Treatment==
The chances of drug resistance can sometimes be minimised by using multiple drugs simultaneously. This works because individual mutations can be independent and may tackle only one drug at a time; if the individuals are still killed by the other drugs, then the mutations cannot persist. This was used successfully in tuberculosis. However, [[cross resistance]] where mutations confer resistance to two or more treatments can be problematic.

For [[antibiotic resistance]], which represents a widespread problem nowadays, destroying the resistant [[bacteria]] can be achieved by [[phage therapy]], in which specific [[bacteriophage]] (virus that kill bacteria) are being used.
