{{Neuron map|Myelin sheath}}

'''Myelin''' is a [[dielectric]] ([[Insulator (electrical)|electrically insulating]]) material  that forms a layer, the ''' myelin sheath''', usually around only the [[axon]] of a [[neuron]]. It is essential for the proper functioning of the [[nervous system]]. It is an outgrowth  of a type of [[glial cell]]. The production of the myelin sheath is called myelination.  In humans, the production of myelin begins in the 14th week of fetal development, although little myelin exists in the brain at the time of birth.  During infancy, myelination occurs quickly and continues through the adolescent stages of life.

[[Schwann cell]]s supply the myelin for peripheral neurons, whereas [[oligodendrocyte]]s, specifically of the [[nerve fascicle|interfascicular]] type, myelinate the axons of the [[central nervous system]]. Myelin is considered a defining characteristic of the [[gnathostome|(gnathostome) vertebrates]], but myelin-like sheaths have also arisen by [[parallel evolution]] in some invertebrates, although they are quite different from vertebrate myelin at the molecular level.<ref name="pmid17208176">{{cite journal | author = Hartline DK, Colman DR | title = Rapid conduction and the evolution of giant axons and myelinated fibers | journal = Curr.

==Composition of myelin==
Myelin is made up by different cell types, and varies in chemical composition and configuration, but performs the same insulating function.  Myelinated axons are white in appearance, hence the "white matter" of the brain. The fat helps to insulate the axons from electrically charged atoms and molecules. These charged particles (ions) are found in the fluid surrounding the entire nervous system. Under a microscope, myelin looks like strings of sausages. Myelin is also a part of the maturation process leading to a child's fast development, including crawling and walking in the first year. 

Myelin is about 40% water; the dry mass is about 70 - 85% [[lipids]] and about 15 - 30% [[proteins]].<!-- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28221/ --> Some of the proteins are [[myelin basic protein]], [[myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein]], and [[proteolipid protein]]. The primary lipid of myelin is a [[glycolipid]] called [[galactocerebroside]]. The intertwining  hydrocarbon chains of [[sphingomyelin]] serve to strengthen the myelin sheath.

==Function of myelin layer==
[[Image:Myelinated neuron.jpg|thumb||Transmission electron micrograph of a myelinated axon, generated at the Electron Microscopy Facility at Trinity College, Hartford, CT]]

The main purpose of a myelin layer (or sheath) is to increase the speed at which [[action potential|impulses]] propagate along the myelinated fiber. Along unmyelinated fibers, impulses move continuously as waves, but in myelinated fibers, they hop or "propagate by [[saltatory conduction|saltation]]." Myelin decreases [[capacitance]] across the cell membrane, and increases [[electrical resistance]]. Thus, myelination helps prevent the electrical current from leaving the axon. 

When a peripheral fiber is severed, the myelin sheath provides a track along which regrowth can occur. Unfortunately, the myelin layer does not ensure a perfect regeneration of the nerve fiber.  Some regenerated nerve fibers do not find the correct muscle fibers and some damaged motor neurons of the [[peripheral nervous system]] die without regrowth.  Damage to the myelin sheath and nerve fiber is often associated with increased functional insufficiency. 

Unmyelinated fibers and myelinated axons of the mammalian central nervous system do not regenerate.

Some studies have revealed optic nerve fibers can be regenerated in postnatal rats.  This regeneration depends upon two conditions: axonal die-back has to be prevented with appropriate neurotrophic factors, and neurite growth inhibitory components have to be inactivated.  These studies may lead to further understanding of nerve fiber regeneration in the central nervous system.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Disorders of the myelin sheath ==

===Demyelination===
{{Further|Demyelinating disease}}
Demyelination is the loss of the myelin sheath insulating the nerves, and is the hallmark of some [[neurodegenerative]] [[autoimmune]] diseases, including [[multiple sclerosis]], [[acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]], Neuromyelitis Optica, [[transverse myelitis]], [[chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy]], [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]], [[central pontine myelinosis]], inherited demyelinating diseases such as [[leukodystrophy]], and [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]].  Sufferers of [[pernicious anaemia]] can also suffer nerve damage if the condition is not diagnosed quickly.  [[Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]] secondary to pernicious anaemia can lead to slight peripheral nerve damage to severe damage to the central nervous system, affecting speech, balance and cognitive awareness.  When myelin degrades, conduction of signals along the nerve can be impaired or lost and the nerve eventually withers. A more serious case of when myelin is deteriorated is also called Canavan Disease. Look into Jacob's Cure Foundation if you are interested in looking further into the disease that occurs on the 17th pair of chromosomes in your body.

The [[immune system]] may play a role in demyelination associated with such diseases, including inflammation causing demyelination by overproduction of [[cytokines]] via upregulation of [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|tumor necrosis factor]]<ref name="pmid9482240">{{cite journal | author = Ledeen RW, Chakraborty G | title = Cytokines, signal transduction, and inflammatory demyelination: review and hypothesis | journal = Neurochem.

====Symptoms====
[[Demyelinating disease|Demyelination]] results in diverse symptoms determined by the functions of the affected neurons. It disrupts signals between the brain and other parts of the body; symptoms differ from patient to patient, and have different presentations upon clinical observation and in laboratory studies. 

Typical symptoms include:
*blurriness in the central visual field that affects only one eye, may be accompanied by pain upon eye movement
*double vision
*loss of vision/hearing
*odd sensation in legs, arms, chest, or face, such as tingling or numbness ([[neuropathy]])
*weakness of arms or legs
*cognitive disruption, including speech impairment and memory loss
*heat sensitivity (symptoms worsen or reappear upon exposure to heat, such as a hot shower)
*loss of dexterity
*difficulty coordinating movement or balance disorder
*difficulty controlling bowel movements or urination
*fatigue

====Myelin repair====
Research to repair damaged myelin sheaths is ongoing. Techniques include surgically implanting [[oligodendrocyte precursor cell]]s in the central nervous system and inducing myelin repair with certain antibodies. While results in mice have been encouraging (via [[stem cell]] transplantation), whether this technique can be effective in replacing myelin loss in humans is still unknown.<ref name="pmid14702638">{{cite journal | author = Windrem MS, Nunes MC, Rashbaum WK, Schwartz TH, Goodman RA, McKhann G, Roy NS, Goldman SA | title = Fetal and adult human oligodendrocyte progenitor cell isolates myelinate the congenitally dysmyelinated brain | journal = Nat.

By increasing [[oligodendrocyte]] cholinergic stimulation, [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor|AChEIs]], and other cholinergic treatments, such as [[nicotine]], possibly could promote myelination during development and myelin repair in older age.<ref name="pmid17070782">{{cite journal | author = Bartzokis G | title = Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may improve myelin integrity | journal = Biol.

===Dysmyelination===
Dysmyelination is characterized by a defective structure and function of myelin sheaths; unlike demyelination, it does not produce [[lesion]]s. Such defective sheaths often arise from genetic mutations affecting the biosynthesis and formation of myelin. The shiverer mouse represents one animal model of dysmyelination.  Human diseases where dysmyelination has been implicated include [[leukodystrophy|leukodystrophies]] ([[Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease]], [[Canavan disease]], [[phenylketonuria]]) and [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krämer-Albers EM, Gehrig-Burger K, Thiele C, Trotter J, Nave KA |title=Perturbed interactions of mutant proteolipid protein/DM20 with cholesterol and lipid rafts in oligodendroglia: implications for dysmyelination in spastic paraplegia |journal=J.
