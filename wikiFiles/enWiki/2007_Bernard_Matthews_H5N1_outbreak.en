The '''2007 Bernard Matthews H5N1 outbreak''' was an occurrence of [[avian influenza]] in England caused by the [[H5N1]] subtype of [[Influenza virus A]] that began on 30 January 2007. The infection affected poultry at one of [[Bernard Matthews Farms|Bernard Matthews]]' farms in [[Holton, Suffolk|Holton]] in [[Suffolk]]. It was the third instance of H5N1-subtype detected in the [[United Kingdom]] and a range of precautions were instituted to prevent spread of the disease including a large cull of [[turkey]]s, the imposition of segregation zones, and a disinfection programme for the plant.

The cause of the outbreak was not determined. However, it was considered significant that Bernard Matthews regularly transports turkeys and turkey products between the UK and its plant in [[Hungary]], and that the H5N1 strains previously found in Hungary, and those found at Suffolk, were effectively genetically identical.

===H5N1===
{{H5N1}}
{{main|H5N1}}
H5N1 is a subtype of the [[Influenzavirus A|Influenza A virus]], the viruses responsible for [[influenza]] in humans and many other animal species.<ref name=ICTV46.0.1>{{cite web

HPAI A(H5N1) is considered an avian disease, although there is some evidence of limited human-to-human transmission of the virus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ungchusak K, Auewarakul P, Dowell SF, ''et al.'' |title=Probable person-to-person transmission of avian influenza A (H5N1) |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=352 |issue=4 |pages=333–40 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15668219 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa044021 |url=}}</ref>  A risk factor for contracting the virus is handling of infected poultry, but transmission of the virus from infected birds to humans is inefficient.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ortiz JR, Katz MA, Mahmoud MN, ''et al.'' |title=Lack of evidence of avian-to-human transmission of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus among poultry workers, [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]], 2006 |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=196 |issue=11 |pages=1685–91 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18008254 |doi=10.1086/522158 |url=}}</ref> Poultry farming practices have changed due to H5N1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php|title=Council on Foreign Relations| accessdate= 15 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> The cost of poultry farming has increased, while the cost to consumers has gone down, due to fears from H5N1 driving demand below supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=26238|title=Poultry sector suffers despite absence of bird flu| accessdate= 29 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071217215838/http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=26238| archivedate= 17 December 2007| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Recent outbreaks in the UK and rest of EU===
The outbreak was the third instance of H5N1 detected in the United Kingdom. The first outbreak occurred in October 2005 among exotic birds imported from Taiwan and South America at a privately owned quarantine facility in [[Essex, England]].<ref>

==The outbreak==
Initial signs of the outbreak occurred on Tuesday, 30 January when 55 turkey poults died and 16 had to be killed because they were sick. At least 185 more died the following day.<ref>[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/feb2007/2007-02-05-01.asp "Britain Culls 159,000 Turkeys in Outbreak of H5N1 Bird Flu"], Environment News Service, 05 February 2007</ref>

It was not until 1 February that the deaths were reported to [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Defra]]. The farm was sealed off while tests were carried out, on samples taken from the dead birds, at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in [[Weybridge]], [[Surrey]]. Another 1,500 birds died on 2 February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23384160-details/Bernard%20Matthews%20took%2048%20hours%20to%20report%20turkey%20deaths/article.do|title=Bernard Matthews took 48 hours to report turkey deaths|date=2007-02-03|accessdate=2007-02-04|publisher=[[The Evening Standard]] (thisislondon.com)}}</ref> Then on 3 February 2007 the H5N1 causation was confirmed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vets work to contain bird flu (Video)|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/player/nol/newsid_6320000/newsid_6328900?redirect=6328957.stm&news=1&bbram=1&bbwm=1&nbwm=1&nbram=1|date=2007-02-04|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref>

A 3&nbsp;km protection zone, 10&nbsp;km surveillance zone and a restricted zone encompassing 2000&nbsp;km² were set up.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tests show bird flu is H5N1 virus|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6327193.stm|date=2007-02-03|accessdate=2007-02-03 | work=BBC News| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070205042118/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6327193.stm| archivedate= 5 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Another 159,000 turkeys were slaughtered with the [[Culling|cull]] being completed on the evening of 5 February. Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not been advised as to the action to be taken.<ref>[http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=News&tBrand=EDPOnline&tCategory=news&itemid=NOED05%20Feb%202007%2012%3A19%3A58%3A420 "Little risk for Bernard Matthews workers"], Sarah Brealey, EDP 24, 05 February 2007</ref> Around 320 workers at the plant were given anti-viral drugs. Although a vet from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6337575.stm "Vet tests negative for bird flu"], BBC News, 07 February 2007</ref> The plant was thoroughly disinfected, with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given for production to resume.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6334239.stm "Clean-up begins at bird flu farm"], BBC News, 06 February 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/12/nbflu612.xml "Farm hit by bird-flu to reopen"], Natalie Paris, Daily Telegraph, 12 December 2007</ref>

It emerged in a highly critical report from [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Defra]] that there was a series of biosecurity failings at the Holton plant, some of which were drawn to the company's attention in the past. These included "gulls were taking turkey waste to roosts on top of the turkey-house 500&nbsp;m away" and "holes in the turkey houses could have allowed in birds or rodents".<ref name=failings/><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/birdflu/story/0,,2015217,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=11 "String of flaws found at Bernard Matthews plant"], John Vidal, The Guardian, 17 February 2007</ref> [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Defra]] [[Minister (government)|minister]] [[Jeff Rooker, Baron Rooker|Jeff Rooker]] stated in a [[House of Lords]] debate on 22 February that the outbreak was "exclusively a Bernard Matthews Holton problem".<ref>[http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2007/03/02/102056/avian-flu-outbreak-is-exclusively-a-bernard-matthews.html "Avian flu outbreak is "exclusively a Bernard Matthews" problem"], Farmers Weekly, 2 March 2007</ref>

==Hungarian connection==
The [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]], on 8 February, admitted that the outbreak may have been caused by semi-processed turkey meat imported directly from [[Hungary]], where the disease is prevalent, despite earlier in the week the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]], [[David Miliband]] assuring the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that there was "no Hungarian connection".<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=McCarthy |title=Bird flu may be linked to meat from Hungary, says Government |work=The Independent |date=2007-02-09 }}</ref>

Bernard Matthews had been importing 38&nbsp;tons of partly processed turkey meat on a weekly basis from their Saga Foods company, in [[Sárvár]], Hungary, to a processing plant next to the farm. Though Saga Foods lies {{convert|165|mi|km}} from where the recent Hungarian H5N1 outbreak had occurred, a [[Board of directors|company director]] admitted it was "possible" that some of the meat could have come from the exclusion zone. In response to this revelation, [[Her Majesty's Government|Whitehall]] expressed concern over [[biosecurity]] and whether any meat may have been distributed for human consumption in Britain.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=GUZPYQEQUVWB1QFIQMGSFF4AVCBQWIV0?xml=/news/2007/02/09/nflu109.xml "Bird flu plant imported turkey from Hungary"], Charles Clover, The Daily Telegraph, 9 February 2007</ref> On 9 February 2007 the Hungarian authorities started an investigation to try to establish whether there was a connection between the Suffolk and Hungarian outbreaks.<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L09621207.htm "Hungary investigates British bird flu link"], Reuters, 09 February 2007</ref> On 11 February the investigation revealed that turkey products were still being transported, in both directions, between the plant and Hungary with [[European Union regulation|EU regulations]] being cited as the reason why a transport ban could not be imposed.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/12/nbflu12.xml " Britain is powerless to stop turkey imports"], David Derbyshire, Daily telegraph, 12 February 2007</ref>

The Hungary link was dismissed by the [[European Commission]] on 12 February.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/12/nbflu512.xml "Bird flu at farm not linked to Hungary"], Natalie Paris, Daily Telegraph, 12 February 2007</ref> Even so, the H5N1 bird flu strains found in Hungary and Britain were shown to be 99.96% genetically identical and, according to an analysis of the viruses by the [[Veterinary Laboratories Agency]] in [[Weybridge]], [[Surrey]], were almost certainly linked.<ref>[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,,2012525,00.html#article_continue "Tests confirm bird flu link to Hungary"], John Vidal, The Guardian, 14 February 2007</ref> A leak from the Government's [[Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms|COBRA]] emergency committee indicated that the authorities were not aware of the Hungarian connection until an investigator found a Gallfoods delivery wrapper in a Bernard Matthews bin. This raised the possibility that the outbreak was due to a "third party [[abattoir]], Gallfoods in [[Hungary]], just outside the restricted zone". This abattoir might have been a middle man for contaminated poultry farming tools, feed, or product from within the restricted zone, such as a Bernard Matthews owned subsidiary in Hungary.<ref>[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23385313-details/Did+Matthews+try+to+hide+turkey+imports/article.do "Did Matthews try to hide turkey imports?"], Evening Standard, 12 February 2007</ref>

In response to the incident and allegations of a cover-up, [[Bernard Trevor Matthews|Bernard Matthews]] himself stated on 14 February "I'm sorry - but this has not been of our making. There's been absolutely no cover up at our end. I've been upset about allegations that we may have withheld information. That is completely untrue."<ref>[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_headline=matthews%2D-not-my-fault%26method=full%26objectid=18623646%26siteid=89520-name_page.html "Matthews: Not my fault"], Victoria Ward, Daily Mirror, 15 February 2007</ref>

Bernard Matthews was given permission to resume its shipments of poultry between the UK and Hungary from 17 February even though Defra indicated that Hungarian turkey products remained the "most plausible" cause of the outbreak.<ref name=failings>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1395903.ece "Bernard Matthews faces prosecution for failures at bird flu plant"], Philippe Naughton, Times Online, 16 February 2007</ref>

==Consequences==
By 8 February there was a lengthening list of countries that had banned the [[importation]] of [[poultry]] products from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] including South Africa, Russia, Japan, and many others but a spokesman for the [[European Commission]] condemned the bans as "totally disproportionate" and the British Poultry Council pointed out that exports were less than 9% of the level of domestic sales.<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C02%5C09%5Cstory_9-2-2007_pg5_19 "UK poultry import bans"], Pakistan Daily Times, February 09, 2007 See also: [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1342148.ece "EU slams bans on British poultry"], Mark Bridge, Times Online, February 06, 2007</ref> [[Supermarket]] sales of Bernard Matthews branded turkeys halved after the onset of the outbreak as shoppers sought out alternatives. One of the biggest ongoing surveys of consumer confidence revealed that, by 13 February 2007, Bernard Matthews was the least respected and trusted brand in Britain.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/14/nbflu14.xml "Bernard Matthews loses sales"], Daily Telegraph, 14 February 2007</ref>

Following the outbreak the company confirmed, on 19 February 2007, that 130 workers would be [[Layoff|laid off]] for a period of twenty days due to a drop in product sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6376459.stm|title=Bernard Matthews staff 'laid off'|publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=2007-02-19 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref> The [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] then called for the government to provide compensation to the workers affected.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.tgwu.org.uk/Templates/News.asp?NodeID=93155&int1stParentNodeID=42438&int2ndParentNodeID=89396&Action=Display| title=Workers must be compensated for Bernard Matthews lay offs|publisher=Transport and General Workers' Union| accessdate= 19 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> The Transport and General Workers' Union paid out hardship monies from union funds to union members, on top of any state benefits to which the laid-off workers were entitled and a one-off £100 payment from Bernard Matthews.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=Mike |year=2007 |month=April |title=T&G union calls for more compensation for culled workforce after Bernard Matthews gets £600,000 for dead turkeys |journal=Personnel Today }}</ref>

A row broke out on 1 March 2007 when it emerged that the Government were paying compensation to the company for the 159,000 culled turkeys while laid-off workers were receiving nothing. At £3.75 each for hens and £3.53 for toms, the payout was then estimated at between £537,000 and £570,000.<ref>[http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=News&tBrand=edponline&tCategory=news&itemid=NOED02%20Mar%202007%2018%3A28%3A07%3A073 "Bernard Matthews to get £600,000 compensation"], Sarah Brealey, Norfolk Eastern Daily Press, 2 March 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_headline=anger-at-bernard-matthews---500-000-bird-flu-pay-out&method=full&objectid=18695171&siteid=89520-name_page.html "Anger at Bernard Matthews' £500,000 Bird Flu Pay-Out"], Louise Male, Daily Mirror, 2 March 2007</ref> In the event, though, the actual compensation bill came out at £589,356.89.<ref>[http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2007/04/19/103117/bernard-matthews-gets-nearly-600000-in-bird-flu-compensation.html "Bernard Matthews gets nearly £600,000 in bird flu compensation"], Farmers Weekly, 19 April 2007</ref> The crisis cost Bernard Matthews at least £20&nbsp;m in lost sales and costs.<ref>[http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=News&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=news&itemid=NOED20%20Apr%202007%2008%3A54%3A57%3A410 "Fury over Bernard Matthews compensation"], Norwich Evening News, 20 April 2007</ref>
