'''Celecoxib''' [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] ({{IPAc-en|s|ɛ|l|ɨ|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|s|ɪ|b}} {{respell|SE|lə|KOK|sib}}) is a [[Sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]] [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) and selective [[COX-2 inhibitor]] used in the treatment of [[osteoarthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[acute pain]], painful [[menstruation]] and menstrual symptoms, and to reduce numbers of colon and rectum polyps in patients with [[familial adenomatous polyposis]]. It is marketed by [[Pfizer]]. It is known under the [[brand name]] '''Celebrex''' or '''Celebra''' for arthritis and '''Onsenal''' for polyps. Celecoxib is available by [[Medical prescription|prescription]] in capsule form.

==Indications==

Celecoxib is licensed for use in [[osteoarthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[acute pain]], painful [[menstruation]] and menstrual symptoms, [[ankylosing spondylitis]], and to reduce the number of colon and rectal  polyps in patients with [[familial adenomatous polyposis]]. It was originally intended to relieve pain while minimizing the gastrointestinal adverse effects usually seen with conventional NSAIDs. In practice, its primary indication is in patients who need regular and long-term pain relief; there is probably no advantage to using celecoxib for short term or acute pain relief over conventional NSAIDs, except in the situation where nonselective NSAIDs or aspirin cause cutaneous reactions (urticaria or "hives"). In addition, the pain relief offered by celecoxib is similar to that offered by [[paracetamol|paracetamol (acetaminophen)]].<ref name="Yelland">{{cite journal | author=Yelland MJ, Nikles CJ, McNairn N, Del Mar CB, Schluter PJ, Brown RM | title=Celecoxib compared with sustained-release paracetamol for osteoarthritis: a series of n-of-1 trials | journal=Rheumatology | year=2007 | volume=46 | pages=135–40 | pmid=16777855  | doi=10.1093/rheumatology/kel195 | issue=1}}</ref>

===Fabricated efficacy studies===
On March 11, 2009, [[Scott S. Reuben]], former chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts, revealed the data for 21 studies he had authored for the efficacy of the drug (along with others such as [[Vioxx]]) had been fabricated, the analgesic effects of the drugs being exaggerated.  Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for [[Pfizer]]. The retracted studies were not submitted to either the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] or the European Union's regulatory agencies prior to the drug's approval. Pfizer issued a public statement declaring, "It is very disappointing to learn about Dr. Scott Reuben's alleged actions. When we decided to support Dr. Reuben's research, he worked for a credible academic medical center and appeared to be a reputable investigator."<ref name="WSJ-3-2009">{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123672510903888207.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Top Pain Scientist Fabricated Data in Studies, Hospital Says | first=Keith J. | last=Winstein | date=March 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Associated Press, Mar 11, 2009, ''Mass. doctor accused of faking pain pill data'' |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jjpBsTFN9SEtQu-xyDltivC2GJ8AD96S2KVO0}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>

==Availability==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

[[Pfizer]] markets celecoxib under the [[brand name]] Celebrex, and is available as oral capsules containing 50, 100, 200 or 400&nbsp;mg of celecoxib.

Celecoxib is not available as a generic in the United States, because it is covered by unexpired Pfizer patents. However, in other countries, including [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], it is legally available as a generic under the brand names Zycel, Cobix, Celcoxx and Celexib''.

XL Laboratories sells celecoxib under the brand name Selecap in [[Vietnam]] and the [[Philippines]].

==Dosing==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

===Adults===
Note: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient treatment goals.

For osteoarthritis, an oral dose, 200&nbsp;mg/day as a single dose or in divided doses twice daily, is used.

For ankylosing spondylitis, the dose is the same as for osteoarthritis.  If no effect is seen after six weeks, the dose may increase to 400&nbsp;mg/day; if no response occurs following six weeks of treatment with 400&nbsp;mg/day, discontinuation and alternative treatment are recommended. Under Canadian labeling, the recommended maximum dose is 200&nbsp;mg/day.

For rheumatoid arthritis, the oral dose is 100–200&nbsp;mg twice daily.

For acute pain or primary dysmenorrhea, the initial dose is 400&nbsp;mg orally, followed by an additional 200&nbsp;mg if needed on day one; the maintenance dose is 200&nbsp;mg twice daily as needed. Under Canadian labeling, the recommended maximum dose for treatment of acute pain is 400&nbsp;mg/day up to seven days.

Dosing adjustment in poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (e.g., CYP2C9*3/*3) may be needed; consider reducing the initial dose by 50%; consider alternative treatment in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis who are poor CYP2C9 metabolizers. Canadian labeling recommends a maximum dose of 100&nbsp;mg/day.

===Pediatrics===
Note: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient treatment goals.

For juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children ≥ 2 years:
*≥10&nbsp;kg to ≤25&nbsp;kg, 50&nbsp;mg twice daily
*>25&nbsp;kg, 100&nbsp;mg twice daily

Consider alternative dosing adjustment in patients who are poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (e.g., CYP2C9*3/*3).

===Geriatrics===
For geriatric patients, no specific adjustment based on age is recommended. However, the AUC in elderly patients may be increased by 50% as compared to younger subjects. Initiate at the lowest recommended dose in patients weighing <50&nbsp;kg.

===Patients with renal impairment===
Use is not recommended in patients with advanced renal disease, but if celecoxib treatment cannot be avoided, renal function should be closely monitored.

In severe renal insufficiency, use is not recommended. Under Canadian labeling, for patients with clearance rates under 30 ml/minute, use is contraindicated. In the case of abnormal renal function tests (persistent or worsening), discontinue use.

===Patients with hepatic impairment===
For moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), reduce dose by 50%. For severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), use is not recommended. Under Canadian labeling, celecoxib use is contraindicated. For abnormal liver function tests (persistent or worsening), discontinue use.

===Forms===

Celecoxib  is available as oral capsules, CeleBREX®, in 50-, 100-, 200-, and 400-mg doses.

==Adverse effects==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
• Anaphylactoid reactions: Even in patients without prior exposure, [[anaphylactic reactions]] and [[angioedema]] may occur; patients with "aspirin triad" (bronchial [[asthma]], aspirin intolerance, [[rhinitis]]) may be at increased risk. Do not use in patients who experience bronchospasm, asthma, rhinitis, or urticaria with NSAID or aspirin therapy.

• Cardiovascular events: [US Boxed Warning]: NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of serious (and potentially fatal) adverse cardiovascular thrombotic events, including [[myocardial infarction]] and [[stroke]]. Risk may be increased with duration of use or pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors or disease. Carefully evaluate individual cardiovascular risk profiles prior to prescribing. New-onset [[hypertension]] or exacerbation of [[hypertension]] may occur (NSAIDs may impair response to thiazide or loop diuretics); may contribute to cardiovascular events; monitor blood pressure; use with caution in patients with hypertension. May cause sodium and fluid retention, use with caution in patients with edema or heart failure. Long-term cardiovascular risk in children has not been evaluated. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of cardiovascular events; alternate therapies should be considered for patients at high risk.
]<ref>Solomon SD, McMurray JJ, Pfeffer MA, et al, “Cardiovascular Risk Associated With Celecoxib in a Clinical Trial for Colorectal Adenoma Prevention,” N Engl J Med, 2005, 352(11):1071-80. [PubMed 15713944]</ref>

• Gastrointestinal events: [US Boxed Warning]: NSAIDs may increase risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, bleeding, and perforation (may be fatal). These events may occur at any time during therapy and without warning. Use caution with a history of GI disease (bleeding or ulcers), concurrent therapy with aspirin, anticoagulants and/or corticosteroids, smoking, use of alcohol, the elderly or debilitated patients. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of GI adverse events; alternate therapies should be considered for patients at high risk. When used concomitantly with ≤325&nbsp;mg of aspirin, a substantial increase in the risk of gastrointestinal complications (e.g., ulcer) occurs; concomitant gastroprotective therapy (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) is recommended (Bhatt, 2008).

• Hematologic effects: Anemia may occur; monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients on long-term treatment. Celecoxib does not usually affect PT, PTT or platelet counts; it does not inhibit platelet aggregation at approved doses.

• Skin reactions: NSAIDs may cause serious skin adverse events, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (, and toxic epidermal necrolysis; events may occur without warning and in patients without prior known sulfa allergy; discontinue use at first sign of rash (or any other hypersensitivity).

==Special precaution==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

Patients with prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding require special precaution. Moderate to severe hepatic impairment or GI toxicity can occur with or without warning symptoms in patients treated with NSAIDs.

===Allergy===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

Celecoxib contains a [[sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]] moiety and may cause allergic reactions in those allergic to other sulfonamide-containing drugs. This is in addition to the contraindication in patients with severe allergies to other NSAIDs. However, it has a low (reportedly 4%) chance of inducing cutaneous reactions among persons who have a history of such reactions to aspirin or nonselective NSAIDs.

===Drug interactions===
Celecoxib is predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C9. Caution must be exercised with concomitant use of 2C9 inhibitors, such as fluconazole, which can greatly elevate celecoxib serum levels. In addition, celecoxib may increase the risk of renal failure with angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors, such as lisinopril, and diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide.<ref name=Label>[http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=793 Celebrex label] Accessed December 27, 2012</ref>

===Pregnancy===

In the US FDA's [[Pregnancy Category|pregnancy categories]], the drug is category C prior to 30 weeks gestation, and category D starting at 30 weeks gestation.<ref name=Label/>

===Risk of heart attack and stroke===

There has been much concern about the possibility of increased risk for heart attack and stroke in users of NSAID drugs, particularly COX-2-selective NSAIDs such as celecoxib, since the withdrawal of the COX-2 inhibitor [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx) in 2004. Like all NSAIDs on the US market, celecoxib carries an FDA-mandated "black box warning" for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk. In February 2007, the [[American Heart Association]] warned celecoxib should be used "as a last resort on patients who have heart disease or a risk of developing it", and suggested that [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), or certain older NSAIDs, such as [[naproxen]], may be safer choices for chronic pain relief in these patients.<ref name="CNBC-AHA">{{cite web | author=CNBC.com | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17349356 | title=Pfizer's Celebrex Should Be 'Last Resort', Heart Group Says | date=2007-02-26 | publisher=CNBC.com}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>

The cardiovascular risks of celecoxib are controversial, with apparently contradictory data produced from different clinical trials. In December 2004, "APC", the first of two trials of celecoxib for colon cancer prevention, found that long-term (33 months) use of high-dose Celebrex (400 and 800&nbsp;mg daily) demonstrated an increased cardiovascular risk compared with placebo.<ref name="Bertagnolli">{{cite journal | author = Bertagnolli M, Eagle C, Zauber A, Redston M, Solomon S, Kim K, Tang J, Rosenstein R, Wittes J, Corle D, Hess T, Woloj G, Boisserie F, Anderson W, Viner J, Bagheri D, Burn J, Chung D, Dewar T, Foley T, Hoffman N, Macrae F, Pruitt R, Saltzman J, Salzberg B, Sylwestrowicz T, Gordon G, Hawk E | title = Celecoxib for the prevention of sporadic colorectal adenomas | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine|N.

On the other hand, a large [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] prevention trial, called ADAPT, was terminated early after preliminary data suggested the nonselective NSAID [[naproxen]], but not celecoxib, was associated with increased cardiovascular risk.<ref name="PLoS">{{cite journal |author= |title=Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in the randomized, controlled Alzheimer's Disease Anti-Inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT) |journal=[[Public Library of Science]] Clinical Trials |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=e33 |year=2006 |pmid=17111043 |pmc=1851724 |doi=10.1371/journal.pctr.0010033 |url= |last1= Adapt Research |first1= Group}}</ref> In 2005, a study published in the [[Annals of Internal Medicine]] found that cardiovascular effects of COX-2 inhibitors differ, depending on the drug.<ref>Kimmel SE, Berlin JA, Reilly M, Jaskowiak J, Kishel L, Chittams J, Strom BL.

Two studies on the cardiovascular risks of celecoxib and other NSAIDs were [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], published in 2006. The first of these, published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', looked at the incidence of cardiovascular events in all previous [[randomized controlled trials]] of COX-2 inhibitors, as well as some trials of other NSAIDs. The authors concluded  a significant increased risk did exist for celecoxib, as well as some other selective and nonselective NSAIDS. However, the increased cardiovascular risk in celecoxib was noted only at daily doses of 400&nbsp;mg or greater.<ref name="Kearney">{{cite journal |author=Kearney P, Baigent C, Godwin J, Halls H, Emberson J, Patrono C |title=Do selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of atherothrombosis?

The Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research (VIGOR) trial presented a five-fold increase in atherothrombotic cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib compared to naproxen.<ref name="Pitt">Pitt B, Pepine C, Willerson JT. Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibition and Cardiovascular Events.Circulation. 2002; 106: 167-169.</ref> Although, the Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS) did not present an increase in occurrence of such events, some experts believe there may be increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events in taking any selective COX-2 inhibitor.  This perception of increased risk comes from looking at the way different proteins are understood to work with each other and with the cardiovascular system.  There are three proposed mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity with selective COX-2 inhibition.<ref name="Pitt" /> The first is that prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) inhibition with relatively unopposed platelet-derived thromboxane (TxA<sub>2</sub>) generation could potentially lead to thrombotic risks. PGI<sub>2</sub> from endothelial cells by COX-2 catalysis has anti-aggregating, anti-proliferative, and vasodilating properties. Conversely, TxA<sub>2</sub> from platelets maintains vascular homeostasis by irreversible platelet aggregating, vasoconstricting, and smooth muscle proliferating properties. The imbalance of PGI<sub>2</sub> may promote TxA<sub>2</sub> thrombosis.<ref name="Pitt"/> In the second proposed mechanism, COX-2 selective inhibitors could theoretically elevate blood pressure by allowing a normal amount of the vasoconstrictor, TxA2, and a stark decrease in the levels of the vasodilator, PGI<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="Lee">Lee YH, Ji JD, Song GG.

To establish more conclusively the true cardiovascular risk profile of celecoxib, Pfizer agreed to fund a large, randomized trial specifically designed for that purpose. The trial began enrollment in 2006 and is not scheduled to be completed until May 2014.<ref name="ClinicalTrials.gov">{{cite web | title=PRECISION : Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs Ibuprofen Or Naproxen | url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00346216?order=13 | work=ClinicalTrials.gov | date=2006-12-07 | publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref> The trial is centered at the [[Cleveland Clinic]], with a planned enrollment of 20,000 high-risk patients. Celecoxib is being compared with the nonselective NSAIDS naproxen and ibuprofen.  Since all patients have arthritis, ethical considerations make it difficult to have a placebo group.  Ultimately, this trial will help answer the question as to whether Celebrex has a riskier cardiovascular profile compared with naproxen or ibuprofen.

==Pharmacology==

Celecoxib is a highly selective [[COX-2 inhibitor]] and primarily inhibits this isoform of [[cyclooxygenase]] (and thus causes inhibition of prostaglandin production), whereas nonselective NSAIDs (such as [[aspirin]], [[naproxen]], and [[ibuprofen]]) inhibit both [[COX-1]] and COX-2. COX-1, traditionally defined as a constitutively expressed "housekeeping" enzyme, is the only isoenzyme found in platelets, and plays a role in the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa, renal hemodynamics, and platelet thrombogenesis.<ref name=Mathew>Mathew ST et al. (2011)[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3197256/ Efficacy and Safety of COX-2 Inhibitors in the Clinical Management of Arthritis: Mini Review].

Print.</ref> In theory, this selectivity allows celecoxib and other COX-2 inhibitors to reduce [[inflammation]] (and pain) while minimizing gastrointestinal [[adverse drug reaction]]s (e.g. [[stomach ulcer]]s) that are common with nonselective NSAIDs.

Celecoxib inhibits COX-2 without affecting COX-1. COX-1 is involved in synthesis of [[prostaglandins]] and [[thromboxane]], but COX-2 is only involved in the synthesis of prostaglandin. Therefore, inhibition of COX-2 inhibits only prostaglandin synthesis without affecting thromboxane, so offers no cardioprotective effects of nonselective NSAIDs.

==Medicinal chemistry==

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of celecoxib was first described in 1997 by a team of researchers at Searle Research and Development. It is synthesized by a [[Claisen condensation]] reaction of an acetophenone with N-(trifluoroacetyl)imidazole catalyzed by the strong base, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide to produce a 1,3-dicarbonyl adduct.<ref name="Penning">{{cite journal | author = Penning TD, Talley JJ, Bertenshaw SR ''et al.'' | year = 1997 | title = Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of the 1.5 Diarylpyrazole Class of Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors: Identification of 4-[5-(4-Methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-1-yl]benzenesulfonamide (SC-58634, Celecoxib) | url = | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 40 | issue = 9| pages = 1347–1365 | doi = 10.1021/jm960803q | pmid = 9135032 }}</ref> Condensation of the diketone with (4-sulfamoylaphenyl)hydrazine produces the 1,5-diarylpyrazole drug moiety.

The Searle research group found the two appropriately substituted aromatic rings must reside on adjacent positions about the central ring for adequate COX-2 inhibition. Various modifications can be made to the 1,5-diarylpyrazole moiety to deduce the structure-activity relationship of celecoxib.<ref name="Penning"/> A para-sulfamoylphenyl at position 1 of the pyrazole was found to have a higher potency for COX-2 selective inhibition than a para-methoxyphenyl (see structures 1 and 2, below). In addition, a 4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl or 4-sulfamoylphenyl is known to be necessary for COX-2 inhibition. For instance, replacing either of these entities with a –SO<sub>2</sub>NHCH<sub>3</sub> substituent diminishes COX-2 inhibitory activity as noted with a very high inhibitory concentration-50 (see structures 3 - 5). At the 3-position of the pyrazole, a trifluoromethyl or difluoromethyl provides superior selectivity and potency compared to a fluoromethyl or methyl substitution (see structures 6 – 9).<ref name="Penning"/> 

The fourth position of the pyrazole is readily affected by steric hindrance such that increasing the bulkiness of the substitution starkly decreases the potency. For example, by progressively increasing the size of R1, from a methyl to propyl, the potency for COX-2 inhibition decreases especially with moieties larger than an ethyl (see structures 10-12). In addition, incorporating a halo-atom at this position provides significantly potent COX-2 inhibition (see structures 13 and 14). While it is known there must be an aromatic system at the fifth position of the pyrazole, optimizing this substituent is difficult since it is not known what combination of modifications will provide the highest potency and selectivity due to the flexible nature of the 5-aryl system. It was found that substitutions at either the para (4-substitution) or ortho (2-substitution) sites have higher potency than meta (3-substitution) sites (see structures 15-17). 

Electron withdrawing groups, such as –CN, at these positions have poor COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition; however, electron donating groups, such as methoxyl, have substantial COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory effects which makes them inefficient as a COX-2 selective inhibitor (see structures 18 and 19 ). The strong COX-1 inhibition of the para-methoxyl can be corrected by substituting a halo-atom at the alpha position. For instance, the introduction of a 3-fluoro or 3-chloro decreases COX-1 inhibition by 43- and 33-folds, respectively (see structures 20 and 21). It is necessary to consider the steric hindrance created by a para-substitution of the 5-aromatic system. Consider the COX-2 inhibitory capacity of the 4-methyl and 4-ethyl modifications: 4-methyl can inhibit COX-2 such that the IC50 is 0.040 μM while that of the 4-ethyl is 0.86 μM which means the 4-methyl substituent is at least 20-fold more potent (see structures 22 and 23). 

Celecoxib is compound 22; the 4-sulfamoylphenyl on the 1-pyrazol substituent is required for COX-2 inhibition and the 4-methyl on the 5-pyrazol system has low steric hindrance to maximize potency, while the 3-trifluoromethyl group provides superior selectivity and potency.<ref name="Penning" /> To explain the selectivity of celecoxib, it is necessary to analyze the free energy of binding difference between the drug molecule and COX-1 compared to COX-2 enzymes. The structural modifications highlight the importance of binding to residue 523 in the side binding pocket of the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which is an isoleucine in COX-1 and a valine in COX-2.<ref name="Price">Price MLP, Jorgensen WL. Rationale for the Observed COX-2/COX-1 Selectivity of Celecoxibfrom Monte Carlo Simulations. Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Lectures. 2001; 11: 1541-1544.</ref> It appears that this mutation contributes to COX-2 selectivity by creating steric hindrance between the sulfonamide oxygen and the methyl group of Ile523 that effectively destabilizes the celecoxib-COX-1 complex.<ref name="Price"/> Thus it is reasonable to expect COX-2 selective inhibitors to be more bulky than non-selective NSAIDs.

G.D. Searle & Co.'', 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The court ruled in favor of Searle in 2004, holding in essence that the university had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2 and therefore the patent was invalid.<ref[http://www.hodgsonruss.com/Home/Practice_Areas/Alphabetical_Listing/Intellectual_Property_Technology/Articles/20012004Articles/Reach-ThroughClaimsDeclaredInvalid ]</ref><ref>Ranjana Kadle (2004) [http://www.kayescholer.com/professionals/sobel_gerald_extras/misc/01_Rochester2_FedCir_Affirm.pdf CAFC Court Decision Reach-Through Claims Declared Invalid]</ref>  

Celecoxib was discovered and<ref>http://www.google.com/patents/US5466823</ref> developed by [[G. D. Searle & Company]] and was approved by the FDA on December 31, 1998.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/98/20998.cfm</ref>  It was co-promoted by [[Monsanto Company]] (parent company of Searle) and Pfizer under the brand name Celebrex.  Monsanto merged with [[Pharmacia]], from which the Medical Research Division was acquired by Pfizer, giving Pfizer ownership of Celebrex.  The drug was at the core of a major patent dispute that was resolved in Searle's favor (later Pfizer) in 2004.<ref>[http://www.hodgsonruss.com/Home/Practice_Areas/Alphabetical_Listing/Intellectual_Property_Technology/Articles/20012004Articles/Reach-ThroughClaimsDeclaredInvalid ]</ref><ref>Ranjana Kadle (2004) [http://www.kayescholer.com/professionals/sobel_gerald_extras/misc/01_Rochester2_FedCir_Affirm.pdf CAFC Court Decision Reach-Through Claims Declared Invalid]</ref>  In ''University of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co.'', 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the [[University of Rochester]] claimed that United States Pat. No. 6,048,850 (which claimed a method of inhibiting COX-2 in humans using a compound, without actually disclosing what that compound might be) covered drugs such as celecoxib.  The court ruled in favor of Searle, holding in essence that the University had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2 and therefore the patent was invalid.  

After the withdrawal of rofecoxib (Vioxx) from the market in September 2004, Celebrex enjoyed a robust increase in sales. However, the results of the APC trial in December of that year raised concerns that Celebrex might carry risks similar to those of Vioxx, and Pfizer announced a moratorium on [[direct-to-consumer advertising]] of Celebrex soon afterwards. After a significant drop, sales of Celebrex have recovered, and reached $2 billion in 2006.<ref name="CNBC-AHA"/>
Pfizer resumed advertising Celebrex in magazines in 2006,<ref name="Berenson">{{cite news |author=Berenson A |title=Celebrex Ads Are Back, Dire Warnings and All  |work=The New York Times |date=April 29, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/29/business/media/29celebrex.html }}</ref> and resumed television advertising in April 2007 with an unorthodox, {{frac|2|1|2}}-minute advertisement which extensively discussed the adverse effects of Celebrex in comparison with other anti-inflammatory drugs. The ad drew criticism from the consumer advocacy group [[Public Citizen]], which called the ad's comparisons misleading.<ref name="Saul">{{cite news |author=Saul S |title=Celebrex Commercial, Long and Unconventional, Draws Criticism |work=The New York Times |date=April 10, 2007 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/business/media/10celebrex.html }}</ref>  Pfizer responded to Public Citizen's concerns with assurances that they are truthfully advertising the risk and benefits of Celebrex as set forth by the FDA.<ref name="Saul"/>

In late 2007, Pfizer released another US television ad for Celebrex, which also discussed celecoxib's adverse effects in comparison with those of other anti-inflammatory drugs.

==Research into cancer prevention==

The role celecoxib might have in reducing the rates of certain cancers has been the subject of many studies. However, given the side effects of anti-COX-2 on rates of heart disease, there is no current medical recommendation to use this drug for cancer reduction.

The use of celecoxib to reduce the risk of [[colorectal cancer]] has been investigated, but neither celecoxib nor any other drug is indicated for this use.<ref>Rial NS et al (2012) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22928902 Clinical end points for developing pharmaceuticals to manage patients with a sporadic or genetic risk of colorectal cancer].  Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2012 Aug;6(4):507-17</ref>  Twelve carcinogenesis studies in rats of mice showed celecoxib prevented intestinal cancer in those experimental settings.<ref>data available on the [http://www.inra.fr/reseau-nacre/sci-memb/corpet/indexan.html Chemoprevention Database]</ref> Small-scale clinical trials in very high risk people (belonging to FAP families) also showed  celecoxib can prevent polyp growth. Hence, large-scale randomized clinical trials were undertaken and results published by N. Arber and M. Bertagnolli in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', August 2006.<ref name="Bertagnolli">{{cite journal |author=Bertagnolli MM, Eagle CJ, Zauber AG, ''et al.'' |title=Celecoxib for the prevention of sporadic colorectal adenomas |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine|N.

However, serious cardiovascular events were significantly more frequent in the celecoxib-treated groups (see above, cardiovascular toxicity).  [[Aspirin]] shows a similar (and possibly larger) protective effect,<ref name="Baron">{{cite journal | title=A randomized trial of aspirin to prevent colorectal adenomas | author=Baron JA, Cole BF, Sandler RS, ''et al.'' | journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine|N.

==Research into cancer treatment==

Different from cancer prevention, cancer treatment is focused on the therapy of tumors that have already formed and have established themselves inside the patient. Many studies are ongoing to determine whether celecoxib might be useful for this latter condition.<ref name="Dannenberg">{{cite journal |author=Dannenberg AJ, Subbaramaiah K |title=Targeting cyclooxygenase-2 in human neoplasia: rationale and promise |journal=[[Cancer Cell]] |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=431–6 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14706335 |doi=10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00310-6 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1535610803003106
}}</ref> However, during molecular studies in the laboratory, it became apparent that celecoxib could interact with other intracellular components besides its most famous target, [[cyclooxygenase]] 2 ([[COX-2]]). The discovery of these additional targets has generated much controversy, and the initial assumption that celecoxib reduces tumor growth primarily by the inhibition of COX-2 became contentious.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schönthal AH |title=Direct non-cyclooxygenase-2 targets of celecoxib and their potential relevance for cancer therapy |journal=Br. J. Cancer |volume=97 |issue=11 |pages=1465–8 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17955049 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6604049 |url= |pmc=2360267}}</ref>

Certainly, the inhibition of COX-2 is paramount for the [[anti-inflammatory]] and [[analgesic]] function of celecoxib. However, whether inhibition of COX-2 also plays a dominant role in this drug’s anticancer effects is unclear. For example, a recent study with [[malignant tumor]] cells showed celecoxib could inhibit the growth of these cells ''[[in vitro]]'', but COX-2 played no role in this outcome; even more strikingly, the anticancer effects of celecoxib were also obtained with the use of cancer cell types that do not even contain COX-2.<ref name="Chuang">{{cite journal|url=http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/7/1/38
|title=COX-2 inhibition is neither necessary nor sufficient for celecoxib to suppress tumor cell proliferation and focus formation in vitro|journal= Molecular Cancer |volume=7|pages=38|year=2008

Additional support for the idea that other targets besides COX-2 are important for celecoxib's anticancer effects has come from studies with chemically modified versions of celecoxib. Several dozen [[Analog (chemistry)|analog]]s of celecoxib were generated with small alterations in their [[chemical structure]]s.<ref name="zhu">{{cite journal |author=Zhu J, Song X, Lin HP, ''et al.'' |title=Using cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors as molecular platforms to develop a new class of apoptosis-inducing agents |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=94 |issue=23 |pages=1745–57 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12464646 |doi= |url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/94/23/1745.full.pdf}}</ref> Some of these analogs retained COX-2 inhibitory activity, whereas many others did not. However, when the ability of all these compounds to kill tumor cells in [[cell culture]] was investigated, the antitumor potency did not at all depend on whether or not the respective compound could inhibit COX-2, showing the inhibition of COX-2 was not required for the anticancer effects.<ref name="zhu"/><ref name="Schönthal-analogs">{{cite journal |author=Schönthal AH, Chen TC, Hofman FM, Louie SG, Petasis NA |title=Celecoxib analogs that lack COX-2 inhibitory function: preclinical development of novel anticancer drugs |journal=[[Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=197–208 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18230053 |doi=10.1517/13543784.17.2.197 |url=}}</ref> One of these compounds, 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib, which entirely lacks the ability to inhibit COX-2, actually displayed stronger anticancer activity than celecoxib.<ref name="Schönthal-antitumor">{{cite journal |author=Schönthal AH |title=Antitumor properties of dimethyl-celecoxib, a derivative of celecoxib that does not inhibit cyclooxygenase-2: implications for glioma therapy |journal=Neurosurgical Focus |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=E21 |year=2006 |pmid=16709027 |doi=10.3171/foc.2006.20.4.14 |url=}}

==Research into adhesion prevention==

Celocoxib may prevent intra-abdominal [[adhesion (medicine)|adhesion]] formation.  Adhesions are a common complication of [[minimally invasive surgery|surgery]], especially [[abdominal surgery]], and major cause of [[bowel obstruction]] and [[infertility]].
