A '''''BRCA'' mutation''' is a mutation in either of the genes ''[[BRCA1]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]''.  Harmful mutations in these genes produce a [[hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome]] in affected families.  Mutations in ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' are uncommon, and breast cancer is relatively common, so these mutations consequently account for only five to ten percent of all breast cancer cases in women.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Hundreds of different types of mutations in these genes have been identified.  High-risk mutations, which disable an important error-free DNA repair process ([[homology directed repair]]), significantly increase the person's risk of developing [[breast cancer]], [[ovarian cancer]] and certain other cancers. Why ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' mutations lead preferentially to cancers of the breast and ovary are not known, but lack of ''BRCA1'' function seems to lead to non-functional [[x-inactivation|x-chromosome inactivation]]. Not all mutations are high-risk; some appear to be harmless variations.  The cancer risk associated with any given mutation varies significantly and depends on the exact type and location of the mutation and possibly other individual factors.

Women with harmful mutations in either ''BRCA1'' or ''BRCA2'' have risk of breast cancer that is about five times the normal risk, and a risk of ovarian cancer that is about ten to thirty times normal.<ref>{{cite web

| date = 29 May 2009 }}</ref>  ''BRCA1'' mutations typically confer a higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer in women than ''BRCA2'' mutations.  Having a high-risk mutation does not guarantee that the woman will develop any type of cancer, or guarantee that any cancer that appears was actually caused by the mutation, rather than some other factor, like [[alcohol and cancer|alcohol consumption]].

Mutations can be inherited from either parent and may be passed on to both sons and daughters.  Each child of a [[genetic carrier]], regardless of sex, has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from the parent who carries the mutation.  As a result, half of the people with ''BRCA'' gene mutations are male.  The risk of ''BRCA''-related breast cancers for men with the mutation is higher than for other men, but still low.<ref name="10yearrisk" />  However, ''BRCA'' mutations can increase the risk of other cancers, such as [[colon cancer]], [[pancreatic cancer]], and [[prostate cancer]].

}}</ref>  A mutated ''BRCA'' gene can be inherited from either parent.  Because they are inherited from the parents, they are classified as  ''hereditary'' or ''[[germline mutation]]s'' rather than ''acquired'' or ''[[somatic mutation]]s''.  Cancer caused by a mutated gene is a ''[[hereditary cancer]]'' rather than a ''sporadic cancer''.

Because humans have a [[diploid]] genome, each cell has two copies of the gene (one from each biological parent).  Typically only one copy contains a disabling, inherited mutation, so the affected person is [[heterozygous]] for the mutation.  If the functional copy is harmed, however, then the cell is forced to use alternate DNA repair mechanisms, which are more error-prone.  The loss of the functional copy is called ''[[loss of heterozygosity]]'' (LOH).<ref name=greenberg>{{cite journal

Some variants are harmless; others are known to be very harmful.  Some [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s may confer only a small risk, or may only confer risk in the presence of other mutations or under certain circumstances.  In other cases, whether the variant is harmful is unknown.  Variants are classified as follows:<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|39-50}}{{rp|109}}

* '''Deleterious mutation''':  The change is proven to cause significant risks.  Often, these are [[frameshift mutation]]s that prevent the cell from producing more than the first part of the necessary protein.
* '''Suspected deleterious''':  While nothing is proven, the variation is currently believed to be harmful.
* '''Variant of unknown significance''' (VUS):  Whether the change has any effect is unknown.  This is a common test result, and most variations began in this category.  As more evidence is acquired, these are re-classified.
* '''Variant, favor polymorphism''':  While nothing is proven, the variation is currently believed to be harmless.
* '''Benign polymorphism''':  The change is classified as harmless.  These may be reported as "no mutation".

Deleterious mutations have high, but not complete, genetic [[penetrance]], which means that people with the mutation have a high risk of developing disease as a result, but that some people will not develop cancer despite carrying a harmful mutation.

==Getting tested==

[[Genetic counseling]] is commonly recommended to people whose personal or family health history suggests a greater than average likelihood of a mutation.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|51-74}}  Genetic counselors are [[allied health]] professionals who are trained to explain genetics to people; some of them are also licensed as [[registered nurse]]s or [[social worker]]s.  A [[medical genetics|medical geneticist]] is a physician who specializes in genetics.  The purpose of genetic counseling is to educate the person about the likelihood of a positive result, the risks and benefits of being tested, the limitations of the tests, the practical meaning of the results, and the risk-reducing actions that could be taken if the results are positive.  They are also trained to support people through any emotional reactions and to be a neutral person who helps the client make his or her own decision in an [[informed consent]] model, without pushing the client to do what the counselor might do.  Because the knowledge of a mutation can produce substantial anxiety, some people choose not to be tested or to postpone testing until a later date.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|51-74}}

If the client chooses to be tested, then two types of tests are available.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|51-74}}  Both commonly use a [[blood sample]], although testing can be done on saliva.  The quickest, simplest, and lowest cost test uses positive test results from a [[blood relative]] and checks only for the single mutation that is known to be present in the family.  If no relative has previously disclosed positive test results, then a full test that checks the entire sequence of both ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' can be performed.  In some cases, because of the [[founder effect]], Jewish ethnicity can be used to narrow the testing to quickly check for the three most [[Medical genetics of Jewish people|common mutations seen among Ashkenazi Jews]].<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|51-74}}

Testing is commonly covered by [[health insurance]] and public healthcare programs for people at high risk for having a mutation, and not covered for people at low risk.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|51-74}} The purpose of limiting the testing to high-risk people is to increase the likelihood that the person will receive a meaningful, actionable result from the test, rather than identifying a variant of unknown significance (VUS). In Canada, people who demonstrate their high-risk status by meeting specified guidelines are referred initially to a specialized program for hereditary cancers, and, if they choose to be tested, the cost of the test is fully covered.  In the USA in 2010, single-site testing had a retail cost of US$400 to $500, and full-length analysis cost about $3,000 per gene, and the costs were commonly covered by private health insurance for people deemed to be at high risk.

The test is ordered by a physician, usually an [[oncologist]], and the results are always returned to the physician, rather than directly to the patient.  How quickly results are returned depends on the test—single-site analysis requires less lab time—and on the infrastructure in place.  In the USA, test results are commonly returned within one to several weeks; in Canada, patients commonly wait for eight to ten months<!-- Yes, that's MONTHS, not weeks. --> for test results.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|51-74}}

A positive test result for a known deleterious mutation is proof of a predisposition, although it does not guarantee that the person will develop any type of cancer.  A negative test result, if a specific mutation is known to be present in the family, shows that the person does not have a ''BRCA''-related predisposition for cancer, although it does not guarantee that the person will not develop a non-hereditary case of cancer.  By itself, a negative test result does not mean that the patient has no hereditary predisposition for breast or ovarian cancer.  The family may have some other genetic predisposition for cancer, involving some other gene.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|89-111}}

Testing young children is considered [[medical ethics|medically unethical]] because the test results would not change the way the child's health is cared for.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|82-85}}  Because taking [[birth control pill]]s before age 20 is associated with very early development of breast cancer in ''BRCA'' mutation carriers, teenage girls may need to be tested before deciding to take [[hormonal contraceptive]]s for any reason.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}}

==Breast and ovarian cancer risk==
{{Further|BRCA1|BRCA2}}

Women with deleterious mutations in either the ''BRCA1'' or ''BRCA2'' genes have a high risk of developing [[breast cancer|breast]] and/or [[ovarian cancer]].  Because different studies look at different populations, and because different types of mutations have somewhat different risks, the risk is best expressed as a range, rather than a single number.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|89-111}}

Approximately 50% to 65% of women born with a deleterious mutation in ''BRCA1'' will develop breast cancer by age 70, and 35% to 46% will develop ovarian cancer by age 70.  Approximately 40% to 57% of women with a deleterious mutation in ''BRCA2'' will develop breast cancer by age 70, and 13% to 23% will develop ovarian cancer by age 70.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|89-111}}<ref name="Chen-2007">{{Cite journal

Statistics for ''BRCA''-related ovarian cancer typically encompass not only cancer of the [[ovaries]] themselves, but also [[peritoneal cancer]] and the very rare, but somewhat easier to detect, cancer of the [[Fallopian tube]]s.  Women with a ''BRCA'' mutation have more than 100 times the normal rate of Fallopian tube cancer.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}}  These three types of these cancers can be difficult to distinguish in their advanced stages.

===When cancer appears===
''BRCA''-related breast cancer appears at an earlier age than sporadic breast cancer.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|89-111}}  It has been asserted that ''BRCA''-related breast cancer is more aggressive than normal breast cancer, however most studies in specific populations suggest little or no difference in survival rates despite seemingly worse prognostic factors.<ref name="Veronesi_2005">{{cite pmid| 15996267}}</ref><ref name="Budroni_2009">{{cite pmid|19232099}}</ref><ref name="Verhoog_1998">{{cite pmid|9652611 }}</ref>
* ''BRCA1'' is associated with [[triple-negative breast cancer]], which does not respond to hormonal treatments and cannot be usefully treated with some drugs, such as [[trastuzumab]]. Breast cancer often appears about two decades earlier than normal.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|89-111}}
* ''BRCA2'' is associated primarily with post-menopausal breast cancer, although the risk of pre-menopausal breast cancer is significant.  It is typically highly responsive to hormonal treatments.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|89-111}}

''BRCA''-related ovarian and Fallopian tube cancer is more treatable than average because it is unusually susceptible to platinum-based chemotherapy like [[cisplatin]].<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}}  ''BRCA1''-related ovarian cancer appears at younger ages, but the risk for women with ''BRCA2'' climbs markedly at or shortly after menopause.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}}

A 25-year-old woman with no mutation in her ''BRCA'' genes has an 84% probability to reach at least the age of 70.<ref name=Kurian_2009/>  Of those not surviving, 11% die from either breast or ovarian cancer, and 89% from other causes.

Compared to that, a woman with a high-risk ''BRCA1'' mutation, if she had [[breast cancer screening]] but no prophylactic medical or surgical intervention, would have only 59% chance to reach age 70, twenty-five percentage points lower than normal. Of those women not surviving, 26% would die of breast cancer, 46% ovarian cancer, and 28% other causes.<ref name=Kurian_2009/>

Women with high-risk ''BRCA2'' mutations, with screening but with no prophylactic medical or surgical intervention, would have only 75% chance to reach age 70, nine percentage points lower than normal. Of those not surviving, 21% would die of breast cancer, 25% ovarian cancer and 54% other causes.<ref name=Kurian_2009/>

The likelihood of surviving to at least age 70 can be improved by several medical interventions, notably prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy.<ref name=Kurian_2009/>

===Male breast cancer===
Men with a ''BRCA'' mutation have a dramatically elevated [[relative risk]] of developing breast cancer, but because the overall incidence of breast cancer in men is so low, the [[absolute risk]] is equal to or lower than the risk for women without a ''BRCA'' mutation.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|Ch8}}  Approximately 1% to 2% of men with a ''BRCA1'' mutation will develop breast cancer by age 70.  Approximately 6% of men with a ''BRCA2'' mutation will develop breast cancer by age 70, which is approximately equal to the risk for women without a ''BRCA'' mutation.  Very few men, with or without a predisposing mutation, develop breast cancer before age 50.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|Ch8}} 

Approximately half of men who develop breast cancer have a mutation in a ''BRCA'' gene or in one of the other genes associated with [[hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome]]s.

Breast cancer in men can be treated as successfully as breast cancer in women, but men often ignore the signs and symptoms of cancer, such as a painful area or an unusual swelling, which may be no bigger than a grain of [[rice]], until it has reached a late stage.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|Ch8}} 

Unlike other men, men with a ''BRCA'' mutation, especially a ''BRCA2'' mutation, may benefit from professional and self [[breast exam]]s.  Medical imaging is not usually recommended, but because male ''BRCA2'' carriers have a risk of breast cancer that is very similar to the general female population, the standard annual [[mammogram]] program can be adapted to these high-risk men.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|Ch8}} 

==Cancer detection and prevention strategies==
A variety of screening options and interventions are available to manage ''BRCA''-related cancer risks.  Screenings are adjusted to individual and familial risk factors.

As these screening methods do not prevent cancer, but merely attempt to catch it early, numerous methods of prevention are sometimes practiced, with varying results.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|175-207}}

===Screening===
An intensive [[cancer screening]] regimen is usually advised for women with deleterious or suspected deleterious ''BRCA'' mutations in order to detect new cancers as early as possible.  A typical recommendation includes frequent [[breast cancer screening]] as well as tests to detect ovarian cancer.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|175-207}}

Breast imaging studies usually include a [[breast MRI]] (magnetic resonance imaging) once a year, beginning between ages 20 and 30, depending on the age at which any relatives were diagnosed with breast cancer. [[Mammograms]] are typically used only at advanced age as there is reason to believe that ''BRCA'' carriers are  more susceptible to breast cancer induction by X-ray damage than general population.<ref name=Pijpe_2012>{{cite pmid|22956590}}</ref>

Alternatives include breast [[ultrasonography]], [[CT scan]]s, [[PET scan]]s, [[scintimammography]], [[elastography]], [[thermography (medical)|thermography]], [[ductal lavage]], and experimental screening protocols, some of which hope to identify [[biomarker]]s for breast cancer (molecules that appear in the blood when breast cancer begins).<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|175-207}}

Ovarian cancer screening usually involves [[ultrasonography]] of the pelvic region, typically twice a year.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|175-207}}  Women may also use a [[blood test]] for [[CA-125]] and clinical [[pelvic exam]]s.  The blood test has relatively poor [[sensitivity and specificity]] for ovarian cancer.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|175-207}}<ref name=Lynch_2009>{{cite pmid|19383374}}</ref>

In both breast and ovarian screening, areas of tissue that look suspicious are investigated with either more imaging, possibly using a different type of imaging or after a delay, or with [[biopsies]] of the suspicious areas.

===Prophylactic medication===
The incidence of ovarian cancer can be reduced by more than half by taking [[hormonal contraception]] for a total of five or six years.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}}  The use of hormonal contraception during teenage years may cause unusually early development of breast cancer in women with ''BRCA'' mutations and is discouraged before age 20.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}} The recommendation therefore is for women to take birth control pills for at least five years in their late 20s or early 30s, as the effect on breast cancer is lowest during these years and highest during middle age.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}}

[[Selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s, specifically [[tamoxifen]], have been found to reduce breast cancer risk in women with ''BRCA'' mutations who do not have their breast removed.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|113-142}}   It is effective as for [[primary prevention]] (preventing the first case of breast cancer) in women with ''BRCA2'' mutations, but not ''BRCA1'' mutations, and for [[secondary prevention]] (preventing a second, independent breast cancer) in both groups of women.  Taking tamoxifen for five years has been found to halve the breast cancer risk in women who have a high risk of breast cancer for any reason, but potentially serious adverse effects like [[cataract]]s, blood clots, and [[endometrial cancer]], along with quality of life issues like hot flashes, result in some women discontinuing its use and some physicians limiting its use to women with atypical growths in the breasts.  Tamoxifen is [[contraindicated]] for women who are most likely to be harmed by the common complications.  [[Raloxifene]] (Evista), which has a reduced risk of side effects, is used as an alternative, but it has not been studied in ''BRCA'' mutation carriers specifically.  Tamoxifen use can be combined with oophorectomy for even greater reduction of breast cancer risk, particularly in women with ''BRCA2'' mutations.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|113-142}}

[[Aromatase inhibitor]]s are medications that prevent estrogen production in the [[adrenal gland]]s and [[adipose tissue]].  They have fewer side effects than selective estrogen receptor modulators like tamoxifen, but do not work in premenopausal women, because they do not prevent the ovaries from producing estrogen.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|113-142}}

===Prophylactic surgery===
Several type of preventive surgeries are known to substantially reduce cancer risk for women with high-risk ''BRCA'' mutations.<ref name=Pruthi_2010>{{cite pmid|21123638}}</ref>  The surgeries may be used alone, in combination with each other, or in combination with non-surgical interventions to reduce the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

* [[Tubal ligation]] is the least invasive of these surgeries and appears to reduce ovarian cancer risk for ''[[BRCA1]]'' carriers by over 60%. [[Salpingectomy]] is another option which is more invasive than tubal ligation and may result in additional risk reduction.  Both of these can be performed anytime after childbearing is complete.<ref name=Pruthi_2010/>  Unlike other prophylactic surgeries, these two surgeries do not reduce the risk of breast cancer.<ref name=Kwon_2013>{{cite pmid|23232752}}</ref>
* [[Prophylactic]] (preventive) [[mastectomy]] is associated with small risks and a large drop in breast cancer risk.
* Prophylactic [[salpingo-oophorectomy]] (removal of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes) results in a very large reduction in ovarian cancer risk, and a large reduction in breast cancer risk if performed before natural menopause.  However, it also comes with the risk of substantial adverse effects if performed at a young age.
* [[Hysterectomy]] has no direct effect on ''BRCA''-related cancers, but it enables the women to use some medications that reduce breast cancer risk (such as [[tamoxifen]]) with the risk of [[uterine cancer]] and to use fewer hormones to manage the adverse effects of a prophylactic oophorectomy.

Whether and when to perform which preventive surgeries is a complex personal decision. Current medical knowledge offers some guidance about the risks and benefits.  Even carriers of the same mutation or from the same family may have substantially different risks for the kind and severity of cancer they are likely to get, as well as the age at which they may get them.  Different people also have different values.  They may choose to focus on total cancer prevention, psychological benefits, current quality of life, or overall survival.  The possible impact of future medical developments in treatment or prognosis may also be of some importance for very young women and family planning.  The decision is individualized and is usually based on many factors, such as earliest occurrence of ''BRCA''-related cancer in close relatives.

The protective effect of prophylactic surgery is greater when done at young age; however, oophorectomy also has adverse effects that are greatest when done long before natural menopause.  For this reason, oophorectomy is mostly recommended after age 35 or 40, assuming childbearing is complete.  The risk of ovarian cancer is low before this age, and the negative effects of oophorectomy are less serious as the woman nears natural menopause.<ref name=Kurian_2009>{{Cite journal

* For carriers of high-risk ''BRCA1'' mutations, prophylactic oophorectomy around age 40 reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancer and provides a substantial long-term survival advantage.  Having this surgery at a very young age provides little or no additional survival advantage, but it does increase the adverse effects from the surgery.  Compared to no intervention, having this surgery around age 40 increases the woman's chance of reaching age 70 by fifteen percentage points, from 59% to 74%. Adding prophylactic mastectomy increases the expected survival by several more percentage points.
* For carriers of high-risk ''BRCA2'' mutations, oophorectomy around age 40 has a smaller effect.  The surgery increases the woman's chance of reaching age 70 by only five percentage points, from 75% to 80%.  When only preventive mastectomy is done at age 40 instead, the improvement is similar, with the expected chance rising from 75% to 79%. Doing both surgeries together around age 40 is expected to improve the woman's chance of reaching age 70 from 75% to 82%

For comparison, women in the general population have an 84% chance of living to age 70.

====Prophylactic mastectomy====
In a woman who has not developed breast cancer, removing the breasts may reduce her risk of ever being diagnosed with breast cancer by 90%, to a level that is approximately half the average woman's risk.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|209-244}}

Bilateral mastectomy is the removal of both breasts by a [[breast surgeon]].<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|209-244}} The [[modified radical mastectomy]] is only used in women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.  Techniques for prophylactic mastectomies include:<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|209-244}}

* [[Simple mastectomy]], which is recommended for women not having breast reconstruction, leaves the least amount of breast tissue in the body and therefore achieves the greatest risk reduction.  In addition to prophylactic use, it is also used by women who have been diagnosed with earlier stages of cancer.
* [[Skin-sparing mastectomy]] removes the tissue of the breast, nipple, and areola, but leave the "excess" skin in place for reconstruction.  It has less visible scar tissue than a simple mastectomy.
* [[Nipple-sparing mastectomy]] removes the breast tissue, but leaves the nipple and the areola intact for a more natural appearance.
* [[Subcutaneous mastectomy]] removes the breast tissue, but leaves the nipple and areola intact.  The scars are hidden in the [[inframammary fold]] under the breast.
* [[Areola-sparing mastectomy]] removes the breast tissue and the nipple, but not the areola.
* [[Nerve-sparing mastectomy]] is an effort to maintain the nerves that provide sensation to the skin over the breasts.  Breasts that have undergone any of these surgeries have much less tactile sensation than natural breasts.  Nerve-sparing techniques are an effort to retain some feeling in the breasts, with limited and often only partial success.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|209-244}}

Which technique is used is determined by the existence of any cancer and overall health, as well as by the woman's desire, if any, for  [[breast reconstruction surgery]] for aesthetic purposes.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|209-244}}  Women who choose a flat-chested appearance or use external breast prostheses typically choose simple mastectomy, with its greater risk reduction.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|209-244}}

Breast reconstruction is usually done by a [[plastic surgeon]], and may be started as part of the same multi-hour surgery that removes the breasts.  Multiple techniques for reconstruction have been used, with different locations and amounts of scarring.  Some techniques use tissue from another part of the body, such as fat tissue from the lower abdomen or occasionally muscles from other parts of the torso.  Others use [[breast implant]]s, possibly preceded by tissue expanders, to provide volume.  Some reconstruction techniques require multiple surgeries.  Afterwards, some women have [[tattoo]]s added to simulate [[breast areola]]s or have the skin reshaped to form a nipple.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|209-244}}

====Prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy====
[[Oophorectomy]] (surgical removal of the ovaries) and [[salpingectomy]] (surgical removal of the Fallopian tubes) are strongly recommended to women with ''BRCA'' mutations.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}} Salpingo-oophorectomy is the single most effective method of preventing ovarian and Fallopian tube cancer in women with a ''BRCA'' mutation.  However, a small risk of [[primary peritoneal cancer]] remains, at least among women with ''BRCA1'' mutations, since the peritoneal lining is the same type of cells as parts of the ovary.  This risk is estimated to produce about five cases of peritoneal cancer per 100 women with harmful ''BRCA1'' mutations in the 20 years after the surgery.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}}

''BRCA2'' related ovarian cancer tends to present in perimenopausal or menopausal women, so salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended between ages 45 and 50.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}}  If it is done before menopause, then the women also benefit from a reduced risk of breast cancer.

The surgery is often done in conjunction with a [[hysterectomy]] (surgical removal of the uterus) and sometimes a [[cervicectomy]] (surgical removal of the [[cervix]]), especially in women who want to take [[tamoxifen]], which is known to cause uterine cancer, or who have [[uterine fibroid]]s.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}}  Multiple styles of surgery are available, including [[laparoscopic]] (keyhole) surgery.  Because about 5% of women with a ''BRCA'' mutation have undetected ovarian cancer at the time of their planned surgery, the surgery should be treated as if it were a removal of a known cancer.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}}

Salpingo-oophorectomy makes the woman [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]] (unable to bear children).  [[Infertility]] services can be used to preserve her [[ovum|eggs]], if wanted.  However, as the benefits to the surgery are greatest close to menopause, most women simply postpone the surgery until they have already borne as many children as they choose to.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|275-302}}

The surgery also artificially induces menopause, which causes [[hot flash]]es, sleep disturbances, mood swings, vaginal dryness, sexual difficulties, difficulty with word recall, and other [[medical sign]]s and [[symptom]]s. The side effects range from mild to severe; most can be treated at least partially.  Many women with  a ''BRCA'' take [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] to reduce these effects:  estrogen-progesterone combinations for women who have a uterus, and unopposed estrogen for women whose uterus was removed.  Estrogen can cause breast cancer, but as the amount of estrogen taken is less than the amount produced by the now-removed ovaries, the net risk is usually judged to be acceptable.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|303-317}}

Some sources assume that oophorectomy before age 50 doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease and increases risk of hip fractures caused by osteoporosis in the relevant population.<ref name=Kurian_2009/>

===Non-medical choices===
Given the high risks and the low benefit of lifestyle choices in ''BRCA'' mutation carriers, no lifestyle choices provide sufficient protection.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|113-142}}

Having her first child at a younger age, having more children than average, and breastfeeding for more than one year decreases the risk of breast cancer for an average-risk woman.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|113-142}}  Studies about this effect among ''BRCA'' mutation carriers have produced conflicting results, but generally speaking, having children is believed to provide little or no protection against breast cancer for women with ''BRCA1'' mutations, and to paradoxically increase the risk of breast cancer for women with ''BRCA2'' mutations.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|113-142}}<ref name="pmid20975359">{{cite journal

Being physically active and maintaining a healthy body weight prevents breast and other cancers in the general population, as well as preventing heart disease and other medical conditions.

Like the general population, mutation carriers born before 1940 have a much lower risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer by age 50 than those born after 1940.<ref name="King-2003"/>  The reasons for the difference is unknown.  Unlike the general population, age at [[menarche]] and age at menopause has no effect on breast cancer risk for ''BRCA'' mutation carriers.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|113-142}}

==Other cancers==

Men with ''BRCA'' mutations cannot get ovarian cancer, but they may be twice as likely as non-carriers to develop [[prostate cancer]] at a younger age.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|Ch8}}   The risk is smaller and disputed for ''BRCA1'' carriers; up to one-third of ''BRCA2'' mutation carriers are expected to develop prostate cancer before age 65.  Prostate cancer in ''BRCA'' mutation carriers tends to appear a decade earlier than normal, and it tends to be more aggressive than normal.  As a result, annual prostate screening, including a [[digital rectal examination]], is appropriate at age 40 among known carriers, rather than age 50.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|Ch8}} 

Cancer of the [[pancreas]] tends to run in families, even among ''BRCA'' families.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|Ch8}}   A ''BRCA1'' mutation approximately doubles or triples the lifetime risk of developing pancreatic cancer; a ''BRCA2'' mutation triples to quintuples it.  Between 4% and 7% of people with pancreatic cancer have a ''BRCA'' mutation.<ref name=pmid16369438 />  However, since pancreatic cancer is relatively rare, people with a ''BRCA2'' mutation probably face an absolute risk of about 5%.  Like ovarian cancer, it tends not to produce symptoms in the early, treatable stages.  Like prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer associated with a ''BRCA'' mutation tends to appear about a decade earlier than non-hereditary cases.<ref name=pmid16369438 />  Asymptomatic screening is [[Invasive (medical)|invasive]] and may be recommended only to ''BRCA2'' carriers who also have a family history of pancreatic cancer.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|Ch8}} 

[[Melanoma]] is the most deadly skin cancer, although it is easily cured in the early stages.  The normal likelihood of developing melanoma depends on race, the number of [[Melanocytic nevus|moles]] the person has, family history, age, sex, and how much the person has been exposed to UV radiation. ''BRCA2'' mutation carriers have approximately double or triple the risk that they would normally have, including a higher than average risk of [[Uveal melanoma|melanoma of the eye]].<ref name=pmid16369438 /><ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|Ch8}} 

Cancer of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] is approximately as common in both men and women in the developed world as breast cancer is among average-risk women, with about 6% of people being diagnosed with it, usually over the age of 50.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|Ch8}}   Like sporadic prostate cancer, it is a multifactorial disease, and is affected by age, diet, and similar factors.  ''BRCA'' mutation carriers have a higher than average risk of this common cancer, but the risk is not as high as in some other [[hereditary cancer]]s.  The risk might be as high as four times normal in some ''BRCA1'' families, and double the normal risk among ''BRCA2'' carriers.  Like pancreatic cancer, it may be that only some ''BRCA'' mutations or some ''BRCA'' families have the extra risk; unlike other ''BRCA''-caused cancers, it does not appear at an earlier age than usual.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|Ch8}}   Normal colon cancer screening is usually recommended to ''BRCA'' mutation carriers.

Mutations in ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' are strongly implicated in some [[hematological malignancies]].  ''BRCA1'' mutations are associated [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] and [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]].<ref name="pmid17683622" />  Mutations of ''BRCA2'' are also found in many [[T-cell lymphoma]]s and [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]s.<ref name="pmid17683622">{{cite journal

If both parents are carriers of a ''BRCA'' mutation, then [[pre-implantation genetic diagnosis]] is sometimes used to prevent the birth of a child with ''BRCA'' mutations.<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|82-85}}  Inheriting two ''BRCA1'' mutations (one from each parent) has never been reported and is believed to be a lethal birth defect.  Inheriting one ''BRCA1'' mutation and one ''BRCA2'' mutation has been reported occasionally; the child's risk for any given type of cancer is the higher risk of the two genes (e.g., the ovarian cancer risk from ''BRCA1'' and the pancreatic cancer risk from ''BRCA2'').  Inheriting two ''BRCA2'' mutations produces [[Fanconi anemia]].<ref name=Morris2010 />{{rp|82-85}}

Each pregnancy in genetically typical women is associated with a significantly reduction in the mother's risk of developing breast cancer after age 40.<ref name="pmid20975359" />  The younger the woman is at the time of her first birth, the more protection against breast cancer she receives.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|113-142}}  Breastfeeding for more than one year protects against breast cancer.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|113-142}}  Pregnancy also protects against ovarian cancer in genetically typical women.<ref name="pmid20975359" />

Although some studies have produced different results, women with ''BRCA'' mutations are generally not expected to receive these significant protective benefits.<ref name=Morris2010/>{{rp|113-142}}<ref name="pmid20975359" />  Current research is too limited and imprecise to permit calculation of specific risks.<ref name="pmid20975359" />  However, the following general trends have been identified:

* For women with a ''BRCA1'' mutation, the woman's age when she first gives birth has no association with her risk of breast cancer.<ref name="pmid20975359" />  Childbearing provides no protection against breast cancer, unless the woman has five or more full-term pregnancies, at which point she receives only modest protection.<ref name="pmid20975359" />  Similar to genetically typical women, pregnancy protects against ovarian cancer in ''BRCA1'' women.<ref name="pmid20975359" />  Breastfeeding for more than one year significantly protects against breast cancer.<ref name="pmid20975359" />  This effect may be as high as 19% per year of breastfeeding, which is much higher than seen among genetically typical women.<ref>{{cite journal

==Evolutionary advantage of ''BRCA'' mutations==
Several hypotheses propose that ''BRCA'' mutations might have evolutionary advantages, such as higher intelligence. The [[Ashkenazi_Intelligence#Cochran_et_al.|Ashkenazi intelligence]] hypothesis was proposed by [[Gregory Cochran]] and asserts that a defect in the ''BRCA1'' gene might unleash neural growth.<ref>{{cite pmid| 16867211 }}</ref>

==Patent enforcement and litigation==

A patent application for the isolated ''[[BRCA1]]'' gene and cancer-cancer promoting mutations discussed above, as well as methods to diagnose the likelihood of getting breast cancer, was filed by the University of Utah, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and [[Myriad Genetics]] in 1994;<ref name=282patent />  over the next year, Myriad, in collaboration with investigators from Endo Recherche, Inc., HSC Research & Development Limited Partnership, and University of Pennsylvania, isolated and sequenced the ''[[BRCA2]]'' gene and identified key mutations, and the first ''BRCA2'' patent was filed in the U.S. by Myriad and other institutions in 1995.<ref name=492Patent />  Myriad is the exclusive licensee of these patents and has enforced them in the US against clinical diagnostic labs.<ref name=SchwartzNYTimes />  This business model led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012;<ref name=MyriadInvestorPage /> it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark [[Association for Molecular Pathology v.
