'''Dehydroascorbic acid''' (DHA) is an oxidized form of [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C). It is actively imported into the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] of cells via glucose transporters.  It is trapped therein by reduction back to ascorbate by glutathione and other thiols.<ref>Welch, R.W.; Wang, Y.; Crossman, A., Jr.; Park, J.B.; Kirk, K.L.; Levine, M.; "Accumulation of Vitamin C (Ascorbate) and Its Oxidized Metabolite Dehydroascorbic Acid Occurs by Separate Mechanisms," ''J. Biol. Chem.'' '''1995''' ''270'' 12584-92.</ref>. The [[Radical (chemistry)|(free) chemical radical]] semidehydroascorbic acid (SDA) also belongs to the group of oxidized ascorbic acids.

Although there exists a sodium-dependent transporter for [[vitamin C]], it is mainly present in specialized cells, whereas the [[glucose transporter]]s, most notably [[GLUT1]], transport Vitamin C (in its oxidized form, DHA)<ref name="MitoGolde"/> in most cells, where recycling back to ascorbate generates the necessary enzyme cofactor and intracellular antioxidant, (see Transport to mitochondria).

The structure shown here for DHA is the commonly shown textbook structure.  This 1,2,3-tricarbonyl is too electrophilic to survive more than a few milliseconds in aqueous solution, however.  The actual structure shown by spectroscopic studies is the result of rapid hemiacetal formation between the 6-OH and the 3-carbonyl groups.  Hydration of the 2-carbonyl is also observed.<ref>Kerber, R.C.; "'As Simple as Possible, but not Simpler' -- The Case of Dehydroascorbic Acid," ''J. Chem. Ed.'' '''85''' ''(2008)'' 1237-1242.</ref>  The lifetime of the stabilized species is commonly said to be about 6 minutes under biological conditions.<ref>May, J.M.; "Ascorbate Function and Metabolism in the Human Erythrocyte," ''Frontiers in Bioscience,'' '''3''' ''(1981)'' d1-10.</ref>  Destruction results from irreversible hydrolysis of the ester bond, with additional degradation reactions following.<ref>Kimoto, E.; Tanaka, H.; Ohmoto, T.; Choami, M.; "Analysis of the Transformation Products of Dehydro-L-Ascorbic Acid by Ion-Pairing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography," ''Anal. Biochem.'' '''214''' ''(1993)'' 38-44.</ref>  Crystallization of solutions of DHA gives a pentacyclic dimer structure of indefinite stability. 
Recycling of ascorbate via active transport of DHA into cells, followed by reduction and reuse, mitigates the inability of humans to synthesize it from glucose.<ref>Montel-Hagen, A.; Kinet, S.; Manel, N.; Mongellaz, C.; Prohaska,R.; Battini, J.L.; Delaunay,J.; Sitbon, M.; Taylor, N.; "Erythrocyte GLUT1 triggers Dehydroascorbic Acid Uptake in Mammals unable to Synthesize Vitamin C," ''Cell'' '''132''' ''(2008)'' 1039-48.</ref>

===Transport to mitochondria===
Vitamin C accumulates in [[mitochondria]], where most of the [[free radical]]s are produced, by entering as DHA through the glucose transporters, GLUT1. Ascorbic acid protects the [[mitochondrial genome]] and [[Mitochondrial membrane#Mitochondrion structure|membrane]].<ref name="MitoGolde">

===Transport to the brain===
Vitamin C does not pass from the blood stream into the [[brain]], although the brain is one of the organs which has the greatest concentration of vitamin C.  Instead, DHA is transported through the [[blood–brain barrier]] via [[GLUT1|GLUT1 transporters]], and then converted back to ascorbate.<ref name="ascorBBB">{{cite journal
