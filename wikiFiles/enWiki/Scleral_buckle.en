A '''scleral buckle''' is one of several [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologic]] procedures that can be used to repair a [[retinal detachment]]. Retinal detachments are usually caused by retinal tears, and a scleral buckle can be used to close the retinal break.

Scleral buckles come in many shapes and sizes. An encircling band is a thin [[silicone]] band sewn around the circumference of the [[sclera]] of the [[human eye|eye]]. Buckles are often placed under a band to create a dimple on the eye wall.

The scleral buckle is secured around the eyeball under the [[conjunctiva]]. This moves the wall of the eye closer to the detached retina. It also may move the retina closer to the [[Vitreous humour|vitreous]]. This alteration in the relationships of the tissues seems to allow the fluid which has formed under the retina to be pumped out, and the retina to re-attach. The [[physics]] or [[physiology]] of this process are not fully understood. 

Retinal detachment surgery usually also involves the use of [[cryotherapy]] or [[laser photocoagulation]]. The laser or cryotherapy forms a permanent adhesion around the retinal break and prevents further accumulation of fluid and re-detachment.

Scleral buckles are done using local or general [[anesthesia]] and are often done as [[outpatient]] procedures. In the majority of treatments the buckle is left in place permanently, although in some instances the buckles can be removed after the retina heals.  The buckle may also be removed in the event of infection.
