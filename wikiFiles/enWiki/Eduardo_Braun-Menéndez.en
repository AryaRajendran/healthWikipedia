==Life and work==
Born in [[Punta Arenas]], [[Chile]], he was a naturalized Argentine citizen from a very early age{{clarify|date=July 2012}}, and was raised in [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=homenaje>[http://www.rpinternet.com.ar/2010/07/18/homenaje-dr-eduardo-braun-menendez-1903-1959/ Homenaje: Dr. Eduardo Braún Menéndez (1903-1959) {{es}}]</ref>  

He studied at the Faculty of Medical Sciences at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], choosing [[cardiovascular medicine]] and [[physiology]] as his specialties. His doctoral thesis dealt with the relationship between the [[pituitary]] gland and [[diencephalon]] to [[blood pressure]], and was developed at the Institute of Physiology under the supervision of [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Noble laureate]] Dr. [[Bernardo Houssay]], in 1934.  After receiving his doctoral degree, he went to [[England]] to study at the [[University College London]], where he investigated the [[metabolism]] of the [[heart]].<ref name=homenaje/> 

On his return from England he joined the prestigious team at the Institute of Physiology, with [[Luis Federico Leloir]], Juan Fasciolo, Juan Muñoz, and [[Alberto Carlos Taquini|Alberto Taquini]] to work for a few years on the mechanism of nephrogenic [[hypertension]]. He made the most important discovery in his career during this research, that of [[angiotensin]], in 1939.<ref name=ht>[http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/32/1/1] ''Hypertension'' (vol. 32, 1998). In Memoriam: Professor Alberto C. Taquini.</ref> 

At the Institute, Braun-Menéndez became a research leader in cardiovascular physiology in 1945, and served as a senior lecturer and teaching assistant in the same area until 1946. He directed the [[Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental|Institute of Experimental Biology and Medicine]] until 1946 and was also the head of [[electrocardiography]] and [[physiotherapy]] at the Municipal Institute of Radiology and Physiotherapy of Buenos Aires. He returned as Houssay Chair at the Institute of Physiology in 1955, as served as Professor. In addition, he was a member of the [[Buenos Aires National Academy of Medicine]] and was honored with the title of ''[[Doctor Honoris Causa]]'' by the [[University of California]] and the [[University of Brazil]]. In addition, he was vice president of the Argentine Society of Biology and secretary of the Argentine Association for the Advancement of Sciences. He received the National Award for Science twice.<ref name=homenaje/>

Braun-Menéndez also helped to create the important scientific journal ''Ciencia y Investigación'' which published its first issue in 1945 and was directed by him until 1959, when he died. Another of his initiatives was the ''Acta Physiologica Latinoamericana'', a publication written in multiple languages for the publication of the work of [[Latin America]]n physiologists. 

Dr. Braun-Menéndez died in a plane crash near [[Mar del Plata]] with his daughter on January 16, 1959. The accident was [[Austral Líneas Aéreas|Austral Air Lines]]' first.<ref name=homenaje/>
