'''Dermatosis neglecta''' is a skin condition in which accumulation of [[sebum]], [[keratin]], [[sweat]], dirt and debris leads to a localized [[Patch_(dermatology)|patch]] of skin discoloration or a [[wart]]-like plaque. It is caused by inadequate hygiene of a certain body part, usually due to some form of [[disability]] or a condition that is associated with [[pain]] or increased sensitivity to touch ([[hyperesthesia]]) or immobility.<ref name="pmid10376717">{{cite journal |author=Ruiz-Maldonado R, Durán-McKinster C, Tamayo-Sánchez L, Orozco-Covarrubias ML |title=Dermatosis neglecta: dirt crusts simulating verrucous nevi |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=135 |issue=6 |pages=728–9 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10376717 |doi= 10.1001/archderm.135.6.728|url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10376717}}</ref>

Dermatosis neglecta typically develops several months after a disability or other affliction leads to improper cleaning. Patients may deny that negligence is the cause of the lesion, even though it completely resolves with vigorous rubbing with alcohol swaps or water and soap (which is both a form of diagnosis and treatment). Recognizing the diagnosis avoids unnecessary [[skin biopsies]].

Examples of case reports from the literature include a man who avoided washing the skin area surrounding an [[artificial pacemaker]] out of fear it might be damaged, a woman who didn't clean the right side of her chest due to hyperesthesia following an amputation for [[breast cancer]] ([[mastectomy]]), a girl who was afraid to wash the area around an abdominal scar, or a man with multiple fractures, [[shoulder dislocation]] and [[radial nerve palsy]].<ref name="pmid19014627">{{cite journal |author=Qadir SN, Ejaz A, Raza N |title=Dermatosis neglecta in a case of multiple fractures, shoulder dislocation and radial nerve palsy in a 35-year-old man: a case report |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=2 |issue= 1|pages=347 |year=2008 |pmid=19014627 |pmc=2596164 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-347 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid17459291">{{cite journal |author=Lucas JL, Brodell RT, Feldman SR |title=Dermatosis neglecta: a series of case reports and review of other dirty-appearing dermatoses |journal=Dermatol.

==Differential diagnosis==
Many other conditions can lead to localized [[desquamation|scaling]] or [[hyperpigmentation]].

This condition should firmly be distinguished from [[dermatitis artifacta]] which is the factitious creation of a skin lesion, whereas dermatosis neglecta results from unconscious avoidance of cleaning due to pain or immobility.

Other skin conditions that should not be mistaken for dermatosis neglecta include [[terra firma-forme dermatosis]]<ref name="pmid16150223">{{cite journal |author=Browning J, Rosen T |title=Terra firma-forme dermatosis revisited |journal=Dermatol. Online J. |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=15 |year=2005 |pmid=16150223 |doi= |url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/112/case_reports/dirtydermatoses/rosen.html}}</ref> (in which there is no history of inadequate cleaning), [[confluent and reticulated papillomatosis of Gougerot and Carteaud]], several forms of [[ichtyosis]], [[acanthosis nigricans]] and [[Vagabond's disease]].

==History==
The term was first coined by Poskitt and coworkers in 1995.<ref name="pmid7772495">{{cite journal |author=Poskitt L, Wayte J, Wojnarowska F, Wilkinson JD |title='Dermatitis neglecta': unwashed dermatosis |journal=Br.
