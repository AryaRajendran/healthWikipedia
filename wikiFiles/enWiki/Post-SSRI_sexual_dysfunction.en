== Symptoms ==
One or more of the following [[Human sexuality|sexual]] symptoms attributed to PSSD after the discontinuation of SSRIs include:

* Decreased [[libido]]
* [[Impotence]] or reduced [[vaginal lubrication]]
* Difficulty initiating or maintaining an [[erection]] or becoming [[aroused]]
* [[Persistent sexual arousal syndrome]] despite absence of desire
* Muted, delayed or absent [[orgasm]] ([[anorgasmia]])
* Reduced or no experience of pleasure during [[orgasm]] (ejaculatory [[anhedonia]])
* [[Premature ejaculation]]
* Weakened [[penile]], [[vaginal]] or [[clitoral]] sensitivity
* Genital [[anesthesia]]
* Loss or decreased response to [[Human sexuality|sexual]] stimuli<ref>[http://psychrights.org/Research/Digest/AntiDepressants/PersistentSexualDysfunctionOffSSRIsCsokaetal(2007).pdf Persistent Sexual Dysfunction after Discontinuation of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors] J Sex Med 2008;5:227–233</ref>

== Prevalence ==
The true [[prevalence]] of PSSD has yet to be determined, although published calls have been made for post-marketing epidemiological studies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kauffman RP |title=Persistent Sexual Side Effects after Discontinuation of Psychotropic Medications |journal=Primary Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue= |pages=24 |year=2008 |url=http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1479}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Farnsworth KD, Dinsmore WW |title=Persistent sexual dysfunction in genitourinary medicine clinic attendees induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors |journal=Int J STD AIDS |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=68–9 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19103903 |doi=10.1258/ijsa.2008.008402 |url=http://ijsa.rsmjournals.com/cgi/content/full/20/1/68-a}}</ref> It is known that SSRIs can cause various types of [[sexual dysfunction]].

===Study data===
While [[sexual dysfunction]] can be common while taking SSRIs, the problem of persistent dysfunction after discontinuation does not appear to be as frequent, or at least not as well-known.  Emerging evidence suggests that such persistence in sexual dysfunction may in fact be more common.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bahrick AS |title=Persistence of Sexual Dysfunction Side Effects after Discontinuation of Antidepressant Medications: Emerging Evidence |journal=The Open Psychology Journal |volume=1 |issue= |pages=42–50 |year=2008 |doi= 10.2174/1874350100801010042|url=http://www.benthamscience.com/open/topsyj/articles/V001/42TOPSYJ.pdf}}</ref> Onset of [[Human sexuality|sexual]] problems often occurs during, and sometimes after, extended SSRI use but there have been reports of rapid onset as well.

These symptoms are quite different from, and should not be confused with, [[hypersexuality]].

===Surveillance and reporting===
To establish, monitor, and regulate causation of PSSD in individual patients, one approach in use by [http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/63/6/896 consulation-liaison psychiatrists] is to assay measurable parameters of patient health ([[hormone]] levels, sexual functioning) with a survey or laboratory tests before and after administering a [[psychiatric]] drug, based on individual patient concern regarding each of the listed side effects. If PSSD develops, a correlation can be established between assay results and PSSD, guiding further treatment for the individual patient and others. A lack of [[education]] on drug side effects and the presence of [[clinical depression]] in a patient who is a candidate for antidepressant therapy can combine to reduce the patient's ability to advocate for tests. Calls have been made for better [[informed consent]] regarding the possibility of permanent sexual dysfunction when prescribing SSRIs to potential patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bahrick AS, Harris MM |title=Sexual Side Effects of Antidepressant Medications: An Informed Consent Accountability Gap |journal=Journal Contemp Psychother. |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2008 |doi= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0483x4276q80417q/}}</ref> Post-administration reporting of side effects may provide useful data for development of new drugs and better inform patients of their risks. In The United States, adverse effects are reported with FDA forms, [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/medwatch-online.htm 3500] for optional use (patients can self-report using this form), and 3500A, for mandatory reporting.

== Etiology ==
It is currently not known what causes PSSD. Fluoxetine ([[Prozac]]), the [[prototypical]] SSRI, is classified as a reproductive toxin<ref>Hines RN, Adams J, Buck GM, Faber W, Holson JF, Jacobson SW, Keszler M, McMartin K, Segraves RT, Singer LT, Sipes IG, Williams PL. ''[http://cerhr.niehs.nih.gov/chemicals/fluoxetine/fluoxetine_monograph.pdf NTP-CERHR Expert panel report on the reproductive and developmental toxicity of fluoxetine.]''NIH Publication No. 05-4471. 2004;1-211.</ref> by the [[Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction]] (CERHR), an [[expert]] panel at the [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]].

===Animal studies===
Experiments with [[rodents]] have shown that [[chronic toxicity|chronic]] treatment with SSRIs at a young age results in permanently decreased sexual behavior that persists into [[adulthood]] and is similar to PSSD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maciag D, Simpson KL, Coppinger D, ''et al.'' |title=Neonatal Antidepressant Exposure has Lasting Effects on Behavior and Serotonin Circuitry |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=47–57 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16012532 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300823 |pmc=3118509}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=de Jong TR, Snaphaan LJ, Pattij T, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of chronic treatment with fluvoxamine and paroxetine during adolescence on serotonin-related behavior in adult male rats |journal=Eur Neuropsychopharmacol |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=39–48 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16107310 |doi=10.1016/j.euroneuro.2005.06.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0924-977X(05)00099-4}}</ref> These studies found reductions in both the rate-limiting serotonin synthetic enzyme, [[tryptophan hydroxylase]], in [[nucleus raphe dorsalis|dorsal raphe]] and in [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT) expression in the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]].

=== Short-term effects ===

Because described gene expression changes are complex, and can involve persistent modifications of chromatin structure, it has been suggested that SSRI use can result in persistently altered [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] gene expression leading to compromised [[catecholamine]]rgic [[neurotransmission]] and [[neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine]] disturbances,<ref name="CsokaAndShipko"/>  However, without detailed [[neuropsychopharmacology|neuropsychopharmacological]], [[pharmacogenomics|pharmacogenomic]] and [[toxicogenomics|toxicogenomic]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Szyf M |title=Toward a Discipline of Pharmacoepigenomics |journal=Current Pharmacogenomics  |volume=2 |issue= 4|pages=357–377 |year=2004 |doi= 10.2174/1570160043377358|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cpg/2004/00000002/00000004/art00006}}</ref> research, the definitive cause remains unknown.

===Relationship to "chemical imbalance" theory===
Some [[critics]] of SSRIs claim that the widely-disseminated [[television]] and print [[advertising]] of SSRIs promotes an inaccurate message, oversimplifying what these [[medications]] actually do.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lacasse JR, Leo J |title=Serotonin and Depression: A Disconnect between the Advertisements and the Scientific Literature |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=e392 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16268734 |pmc=1277931 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392}}</ref> Much of the criticism stems from questions about the validity of claims that SSRIs work by correcting [[Chemical imbalance theory|chemical imbalances]].  Without tools to accurately measure neurotransmitter levels and to allow for continuous monitoring during treatment, it remains difficult to know if one is correctly targeting a deficient neurotransmitter (i.e. correcting an imbalance) or reaching a desirable level of a particular neurotransmitter. It has been argued that without this knowledge for each patient, SSRIs can actually cause chemical imbalances and abnormal brain states.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moncrieff J, Cohen D |title=Do Antidepressants Cure or Create Abnormal Brain States? |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e240 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16724872 |pmc=1472553 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030240 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030240}}</ref> One possible mechanism is by inhibition of [[dopamine]]rgic neurotransmission,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Damsa C, Bumb A, Bianchi-Demicheli F, ''et al.'' |title="Dopamine-dependent" side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: a clinical review |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=1064–8 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15323590 |url=http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&ID=10001001 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v65n0806}}</ref> resulting in described persistent sexual dysfunction.

====Other drugs====
[[Antipsychotics]] are also known to cause sexual dysfunction that is similar to PSSD, especially because of their antagonist effects on [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub>]] dopamine receptors, as well as [[Histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]], [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]] antagonism.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2327229/ Side effects of atypical antipsychotics: a brief overview]</ref> [[Finasteride]], which is used to treat male pattern baldness and benign prostatic hypertrophy, has also been found to cause persistent sexual dysfunction in a subset of patients that are treated with the drug.<ref><http://abcnews.go.com/Health/baldness-drug-propecia-long-lasting-possibly-permanent-sexual/story?id=16758123#.UCecOGlrPww></ref>

== Treatment ==
There is no known cure for PSSD, mostly because its etiology is still poorly understood. Possible treatment options for SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction have been reviewed theoretically.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Keller Ashton A, Hamer R, Rosen RC |title=Serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced sexual dysfunction and its treatment: a large-scale retrospective study of 596 psychiatric outpatients |journal=J Sex Marital Ther |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=165–75 |year=1997 |pmid=9292832 |doi=10.1080/00926239708403922}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6163.2002.tb00665.x |author=Keltner NL, McAfee KM, Taylor CL |title=Mechanisms and treatments of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction |journal=Perspect Psychiatr Care |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=111–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12385082 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sukoff Rizzo SJ, Pulicicchio C, Malberg JE, ''et al.'' |title=5-HT(1A) receptor antagonism reverses and prevents fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction in rats |journal=Int.

According to a survey of psychiatrists, [[Wellbutrin]] (Bupropion) is the drug of choice for the treatment of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, although this is not an FDA-approved indication. Thirty-six percent of psychiatrists preferred switching patients with SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction to bupropion, and 43 percent favored the augmentation of the current medication with bupropion.<ref>{{cite journal | author =Dording CM, Mischoulon D, Petersen TJ, Kornbluh R, Gordon J, Nierenberg AA, Rosenbaum JE, Fava M.| title = The pharmacologic management of SSRI-induced side effects: a survey of psychiatrists| journal = Ann Clin Psychiatry| volume = 14|issue=3| pages = 143–7 | year = 2002|pmid=12585563 | doi =10.3109/10401230209147450}}</ref> A higher dose of bupropion (minimum 300&nbsp;mg) may be necessary: a randomized study employing a lower dose (150&nbsp;mg) failed to find a significant difference between bupropion, sexual therapy or combined treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cabello F| title = Effectiveness of the Treatment of Female Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder | journal = J Sex Research| month = February| year = 2006| accessdate = 2007-04-05 | url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_1_43/ai_n16102437}}</ref> Some [[off-label]] prescriptions also include [[pramipexole]], [[ropinirole]], [[yohimbine]]... and possibly other molecules increasing the [[dopamine]] blood levels.

The chemical [[cabergoline]], which is an agonist of D2 receptors, which in turn decreases prolactin, has fully restored orgasm in 1/3rd of anorgasmic subjects, and partially restored orgasm in another 1/3rd of subjects.

== Community groups ==
Groups have formed to help support people with PSSD, raise awareness, and look for cures.  These include the following internet forums:

SSRIsex Yahoo Group. A forum for victims to share their personal stories about PSSD, do research and look for cures.<ref>SSRIsex Yahoo Group http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/SSRIsex/ </ref>

PSSD collaborative research. A forum dedicated to collaborative research into PSSD (post SSRI sexual dysfunction).<ref>http://pssd.forumotion.com/ PSSD collaborative research. A forum dedicated to collaborative research into PSSD (post SSRI sexual dysfunction).</ref>
