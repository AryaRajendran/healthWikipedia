'''Urobilinogen''' is a colourless product of [[bilirubin]] reduction. It is formed in the intestines by [[bacteria]]l action. Some urobilinogen is reabsorbed, taken up into the circulation and excreted by the kidney. This constitutes the normal "enterohepatic urobilinogen cycle".

Increased amounts of bilirubin are formed in [[hemolysis]], which generates increased urobilinogen in the gut. In  liver disease (such as hepatitis), the intrahepatic urobilinogen cycle is inhibited also increasing urobilinogen levels. Urobilinogen is converted to the yellow pigmented [[urobilin]] apparent in urine. 

The urobilinogen (also known as  [[stercobilinogen]]) in the intestine is then oxidized to brown [[stercobilin]], which gives the feces their characteristic color. 

In biliary obstruction, below-normal amounts of conjugated bilirubin reach the intestine for conversion to urobilinogen. With limited urobilinogen available for reabsorption and excretion, the amount of urobilin found in the urine is low. High amounts of the soluble conjugated bilirubin enter the circulation where they are excreted via the kidneys. These mechanisms are responsible for the dark urine and pale stools observed in biliary obstruction.   

Low urine urobilinogen may result from complete obstructive jaundice or treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which destroy the intestinal bacterial flora. (Obstruction of bilirubin passage into the gut or failure of urobilinogen production in the gut.)

Low urine urobilinogen levels may result from congenital enzymatic jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia syndromes) or from treatment with drugs that acidify urine, such as [[ammonium chloride]] or [[ascorbic acid]]. 

Elevated levels may indicate hemolytic anaemia (excessive breakdown of red blood cells), overburdening of the liver, increased urobilinogen production, re-absorption - a large [[hematoma]], restricted liver function, hepatic infection, poisoning or liver cirrhosis.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.family-health-information.com/lab-tests/urobilinogen.htm | title = Urobilinogen | publisher = Family Health Information | accessdate = 2008-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anytestkits.com/utk-urobilinogen-in-urine.htm | title = Urobilinogen in urine | publisher = Home test kist | accessdate = 2008-03-30}}</ref>

==Nomenclature==

Urobilinogen (aka d-urobilinogen) is closely related to two other compounds: mesobilirubinogen (aka i-urobilinogen) and stercobilinogen (aka i-stercobilinogen).<ref name=expasy_pathways>{{cite web|title=Biochemical Pathways Map No. L5 L6|url=http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/pathways/show_image?L6&up|publisher=ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref>  Specifically, urobilinogen can be reduced to form mesobilirubinogen, and mesobilirubinogen can be further reduced to form stercobilinogen.<ref name=expasy_pathways /> Confusingly, however, all three of these compounds are frequently collectively referred to as "urobilinogens".<ref name=Henrys543>{{cite book|title=Henry's clinical diagnosis and management by laboratory methods.|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4377-0974-2|pages=543|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/das/book/pdf/307240054-3/978-1-4377-0974-2/4-u1.0-B978-1-4377-0974-2..00031-2..DOCPDF.pdf?isbn=978-1-4377-0974-2&eid=4-u1.0-B978-1-4377-0974-2..00031-2..DOCPDF|edition=22nd ed.}}</ref> 

==Ehrlich unit==
Urobilinogen content is determined by a reaction with Ehrlich's reagent, which contains [[para-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde]] and may be measured in ''Ehrlich units''. One Ehrlich unit is equal to one milligram of urobilinogen per deciliter of sample (1 mg/dL).<ref>[http://www.medialabinc.net/urobilinogen-keyword.aspx Urobilinogen Information and Courses from MediaLab, Inc.] Retrieved on Jan 8, 2009</ref>
