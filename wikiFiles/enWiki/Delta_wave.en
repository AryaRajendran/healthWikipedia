A '''delta wave''' is  a high [[amplitude]] [[neural oscillation|brain wave]] with a frequency of oscillation between 0–4 [[hertz]]. Delta waves, like other brain waves, are recorded with an [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]]<ref name="isbn0-550-14110-3">{{cite book |author=Walker, Peter |title=Chambers dictionary of science and technology |publisher=Chambers |location=Edinburgh |year=1999 |page= 312 |isbn=0-550-14110-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> (EEG) and are usually associated with the deepest stages of sleep (3 [[NREM]]), also known as [[slow-wave sleep]] (SWS), and aid in characterizing the depth of sleep.

==Background and history==

"Delta waves" were first described in the early 1900s by [[W. Grey Walter]], who improved upon Dr. [[Hans Berger]]'s [[electroencephalograph]] machine (EEG) to detect alpha and delta waves.

==Classification and features==

Delta waves, like all brain waves, are detected by [[electroencephalography]] (EEG).  Delta waves were originally defined as having a frequency between 1-4 [[hertz]], although more recent classifications put the boundaries at between 0.5 and 2 hertz.  They are the slowest, but highest amplitude brainwaves.  Delta waves begin to appear in stage 3 sleep, but by stage 4 nearly all  spectral activity is dominated by delta waves.  Stage 3 sleep is defined as having less than 50% delta wave activity, while stage 4 sleep has more than 50% delta wave activity. These stages have recently been combined and are now collectively referred to as [[Sleep#NREM sleep|stage]] N3 slow-wave sleep.<ref>"Glossary. A resource from the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Produced in partnership with WGBH Educational Foundation". Harvard University. 2008. Retrieved 2009-03-11. "The 1968 categorization of the combined Sleep Stages 3 – 4 was reclassified in 2007 as Stage N3."</ref>  During N3 SWS, delta waves account for 20% or more of the EEG record during this stage.<ref>Iber C, Ancoli-Israel S, Chesson A, and Quan SF for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events: Rules, Terminology and Technical Specifications, 1st ed.: Westchester, Illinois: American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2007.</ref>  Delta waves occur in all mammals, and potentially all animals as well.

Delta waves are often associated with another EEG phenomenon, the [[K-complex]]. K-Complexes have been shown to immediately precede delta waves in slow wave sleep.<ref>De Gennaro, L., Ferrara, M., & Bertini, M. (2000). The spontaneous K-complex during stage 2 sleep: is it the 'forerunner' of delta waves? [Article]. Neuroscience Letters, 291(1), 41–43.</ref>

==Neurophysiology==
===Sex differences===

Females have been shown to have more delta wave activity, and this is true across most mammal species. This discrepancy does not become apparent until early adulthood (in the 30's or 40's, in humans), with men showing greater age-related reductions in delta wave activity than their female counterparts.<ref>Ehlers, C. L., and D. J. Kupfer. "Slow-wave Sleep: Do Young Adult Men and Women Age Differently?" J Sleep Res. 6.3 (1997): 211-15. Print.</ref>  It has been suggested{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} that this discrepancy may be due to larger skull size in males, but this theory has been refuted{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} by intracranial data from female cats, which still show more delta activity.

===Brain localization and biochemistry===

Delta waves can arise either in the thalamus or in the cortex.  When associated with the thalamus, they likely arise in coordination with the [[reticular formation]].<ref name="isbn034056136x">{{cite book |author=Gross, Richard E. |title=Psychology: the science of mind and behaviour |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |location=London |year=1992 |pages= 112–113|isbn=0-340-56136-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>Maquet, P., Degueldre, C., Delfiore, G., Aerts, J., Peters, J. M., Luxen, A., et al. (1997). Functional neuroanatomy of human slow wave sleep. Journal of Neuroscience, 17(8), 2807-2812.</ref> In the cortex, the [[suprachiasmatic nuclei]] have been shown to regulate delta waves, as lesions to this area have been shown to cause disruptions in delta wave activity. In addition, delta waves show a lateralization, with right hemisphere dominance during sleep.<ref>Mistlberger, R. E., Bergmann, B. M., & Rechtschaffen, A. (1987).

Delta waves have been shown to be mediated in part by [[T-type calcium channel]]s.<ref>Lee, J., Kim, D., Shin, H.

PNAS;101(52): 18195-18199.</ref> During delta wave sleep, neurons are globally inhibited by [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA).<ref name="Hobson, J. 2002">Hobson, J. , & Pace-Schott, E. (2002). The Cognitive Neuroscience of Sleep: Neuronal Systems, Consciousness and Learning. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 3(9), 679-693.</ref>

Delta activity stimulates the release of several hormones, including growth hormone releasing hormone [[GHRH]] and [[prolactin]] (PRL). GHRH is released  from the [[hypothalamus]], which in turn stimulates release of growth hormone from the [[pituitary]]. Like growth hormone, the secretion of prolactin - which is closely related to growth hormone (GH) - is also regulated by the pituitary. [[Thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH) activity is decreased in response to delta-wave signaling.<ref>Brandenberger, G. (2003). The Ulradien Rhythm of Sleep: Diverse Relations with Pituitary and Adrenal Hormones. Revue Neurologique, 159(11), S5-S10.</ref>

==Development==

Infants have been shown to spend a great deal of time in [[slow-wave sleep]], and thus have more delta wave activity. In fact, delta-waves are the predominant wave forms of infants. Analysis of the [[Wakefulness|waking]] EEG of a [[newborn]] infant indicates that delta wave activity is predominant in that age, and still appears in a waking EEG of five-year-olds.<ref name="isbn0-632-05361-5">{{cite book |author=Taylor, Eric; Rutter, Michael |title=Child and adolescent psychiatry |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2002 |page= 162 |isbn=0-632-05361-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Delta wave activity during slow-wave sleep declines during adolescence, with a drop of around 25% reported between the ages of 11 and 14 years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brain Wave Changes In Adolescence Signal Reorganization Of The Brain|publisher=ScienceDaily|date=2006-12-08|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061207160458.htm|
accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref> Delta waves have been shown to decrease across the lifespan, with most of the decline seen in the mid-forties. By the age of about 75, stage four sleep and delta waves may be entirely absent.<ref>Colrain, I. M., Crowley, K. E., Nicholas, C. L., Afifi, L., Baker, F. C., Padilla, M., et al. (2010). Sleep evoked delta frequency responses show a linear decline in amplitude across the adult lifespan. [Article]. Neurobiology of Aging, 31(5), 874-883.</ref>
In addition to a decrease in the incidence of delta waves during slow-wave sleep in the elderly, the incidence of temporal delta wave activity is common seen in older adults, and incidences also increase with age.<ref>Inui, Koji, Eishi Motomura, Hiroyuki Kaige, and Sen Nomura. "Temporal Slow Waves and Cerebrovascular Diseases - Inui - 2008 - Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences." Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences 55.5 (2001): 525-31. Wiley Online Library. Web. 29 Nov. 2010.</ref>

==Disruptions and disorders==

Regional delta wave activity not associated with NREM sleep was first described by [[W. Grey Walter]], who studied cerebral hemisphere tumors. Disruptions in delta wave activity and slow wave sleep are seen in a wide array of disorders. In some cases there may be increases or decreases in delta wave activity, while others may manifest as disruptions in delta wave activity, such as alpha waves presenting in the EEG spectrum.  Delta wave disruptions may present as a result of physiological damage, changes in nutrient metabolism, chemical alteration, or may also be idiopathic.
Disruptions in delta activity is seen in adults during states of [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] or [[delirium]] and in those diagnosed with various neurological disorders such as [[dementia]] or [[schizophrenia]].<ref name="isbn1-58562-239-7">{{cite book |author=Hales, Robert E.; Yudofsky, Stuart C. |title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, Fifth Edition (American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Neuropsychiatry) |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-58562-239-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Temporal Low-voltage Irregular Delta Wave (TLID)===

Temporal low-voltage irregular delta wave activity has been commonly detected in patients with ischemic brain diseases.  In addition, small ischemic lesions have been shown to be closely correlated with TLID, and are indicative of early-stage cerebrovasular damage.<ref>Inui, Koji, Hozumi Kawamoto, Masahiko Kawakita, Kazuhisa Wako, Hiromichi Nakashima, Masanori Kamihara, and Junichi Nomura. "Temporal Delta Wave and Ischemic Lesions on MRI." Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences 48.4 (1994): 891-98. Print.</ref>

===Parasomnias===

[[Parasomnias]] are often associated with disruptions in slow wave sleep.  [[Sleep walking]] and sleep talking most often occur during periods of high-delta wave activity. Sleep walkers have also been shown to have more Hypersynchronous Delta Activity (HSD activity) compared to total time spent in stages 2, 3, and 4 sleep relative to healthy controls. ''Hypersynchronous Delta Activity'' (HSD) are continuous, high-voltage (> 150 uV) delta waves seen in sleep EEGs.<ref name="ReferenceA">Pilon M; Zadra A; Joncas S et al. Hypersynchronous delta waves and somnambulism: brain topography and effect of sleep deprivation. SLEEP 2006;29(1): 77-84.</ref> Parasomnias which occur deep in NREM sleep also include [[sleep terrors]] and confusional arousals.

===Sleep deprivation===

Total sleep deprivation has been shown to increase delta wave activity during sleep recovery,<ref>Feinberg, I., T. Baker, R. Leder, and J. D. March. "Response of Delta (0-3 Hz) EEG and Eye Movement Density to a Night with 100 Minutes of Sleep." Sleep 11.5 (1988): 473-87. Print.</ref> and has also been shown to increase hypersynchronous delta activity (HSD).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Parkinson's disease===

Sleep disturbances, as well as dementia, are common features of [[Parkinson's disease]], and patients with PD show disrupted brain wave activity.  The drug rotigotine, developed for PD, has been shown to increase delta power and slow-wave sleep in those with Parkinson's disease.  Interestingly, delta-wave inducing peptide injected into the [[substantia nigra]] of the rat model has been shown to increase parkinsonian symptoms.<ref>Kryzhanovskii, G. N., A. A. Shandra, L. S. Godlevskii, and I. I. Mikhaleva. "Appearance of Parkinsonian Syndrome after Administration of Delta Sleep-inducing Peptide into the Rat Substantia Nigra." Biull Eksp Biol Med. 109.2 (1990): 119-21. Print.</ref>

===Schizophrenia===

People suffering schizophrenia have shown disrupted EEG patterns, and there is a close association of reduced delta waves during deep sleep and negative symptoms associated with [[schizophrenia]]. During slow wave sleep (stages 3 and 4), schizophrenics have been shown to have reduced delta wave activity, although delta waves have also been shown to be increased during waking hours in more severe forms of schizophrenia.<ref>Alfimova, M. V., & Uvarova, L. G. (2007). Changes in the EEG spectral power during perception of neutral and emotionally salient words in schizophrenic patients, their relatives and healthy individuals from general population. [Article]. Zhurnal Vysshei Nervnoi Deyatelnosti Imeni I P Pavlova, 57(4), 426-436.</ref>
A recent study has shown that the right frontal and central delta wave dominance, seen in healthy individuals, is absent in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, the negative correlation between delta wave activity and age is also not observed in those with schizophrenia.<ref>Sekimoto, M., et al., Cortical regional differences of delta waves during all-night sleep in schizophrenia, Schizophr. Res. (2010), {{doi|10.1016/j.schres.2010.11.003}}</ref>

===Diabetes and insulin resistance===

Disruptions in slow wave (delta) sleep have been shown to increase risk for development of Type II diabetes, potentially due to disruptions in the growth hormone secreted by the pituitary. In addition, hypoglycemia occurring during sleep may also disrupt delta-wave activity.<ref>Abdelkarim, T. H., Westin, T., Romaker, A., & Girish, M. (2002). Presence of delta waves in REM sleep during polysomnography as a sign of acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy. [Meeting Abstract]. Sleep, 25, 531.</ref> Low-voltage irregular delta waves (TLID) have also been found in the left temporal lobe of diabetic patients, at a rate of 56% (compared to 14% in healthy controls).<ref>Appearance of Parkinsonian Syndrome after Administration of Delta Sleep-inducing Peptide into the Rat Substantia Nigra." Biull Eksp Biol Med. 109.2 (1990): 119-21. Print.</ref><ref>Inui, K., H. Sannan, H. Ota, Y. Uji, S. Nomura, H. Kaige, I. Kitayama, and J. Nomura. "EEG Findings in Diabetic Patients with and without Retinopathy." Acta Neurologica Scandinavica 97.2 (1998): 107-09. Print.</ref>

===Fibromyalgia===

Patients suffering from [[fibromyalgia]] often report unrefreshing sleep. A study conducted in 1975 by Moldovsky ''et al.'' showed that the delta wave activity of these patients in stages 3 and 4 sleep were often interrupted by [[alpha wave]]s. They later showed that depriving the body of delta wave sleep activity also induced musculoskeletal pain and fatigue.<ref>Nezu, Arthur M. ., Christine Maguth. Nezu, Pamela A. . Geller, and Irving B. . Weiner. Handbook of Psychology. New York: Wiley, 2003. Print.</ref>

===Alcoholism===

Alcohol has been shown to decrease slow wave sleep and delta power, while increasing stage 1 and REM incidence in both men and women.  In long-term alcohol abuse, the influences of alcohol on sleep architecture  and reductions in delta activity have been shown to persist even after long periods of abstinence.<ref>Colrain, I. M., S. Turlington, and F. C. Baker. "Impact of Alcoholism on Sleep Architecture and EEG Power Spectra in Men and Women." Sleep. 32.10 (2009): 1341-352. Print.</ref>

===Temporal lobe epilepsy===

Slow waves, including delta waves, are associated with seizure-like activity within the brain.
[[W. Grey Walter]] was the first person to use delta waves from an EEG to locate brain tumors and lesions causing temporal lobe epilepsy.<ref>Walter WG. The location of cerebral tumors by electroencephalography. Lancet 1936;2: 305–8.</ref> [[Neurofeedback]] has been suggested as a treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy, and theoretically acts to reduce inappropriate delta wave intrusion, although there has been limited clinical research in this area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epilepsyhealth.com/biofeedback.html |title=Biofeedback for Epileptic Seizures; EEG Neurofeedback for Epilepsy |publisher=Epilepsyhealth.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref>

===Other disorders===

Other disorders frequently associated with disrupted delta-wave activity include:
* depression
* anxiety
* obsessive–compulsive disorder
* [[attention deficit disorder]] (ADD)/ attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<ref>EEG-defined subtypes of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Adam R Clarke, Robert J Barry, Rory McCarthy, Mark Selikowitz.  Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. 1 November 2001 (volume 112 issue 11 Pages 2098-2105)</ref>
* juvenile chronic arthritis<ref>Lopes, M.C., Guilleminault, C., Rosa, A., Passarelli, C., Roizenblatt, S., Tufik, S. Delta sleep instability in children with chronic arthritis. Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research. 2008;41(10): 938-43.</ref>

==Consciousness and dreaming==

Initially, dreaming was thought to only occur in rapid eye movement sleep, though it is now known that dreaming may also occur during slow-wave sleep. Delta waves and delta wave activity are marked, in most people, by an apparently unconscious state, and the loss of physical awareness as well as the "iteration of information".  Nevertheless, some people who practice a type of deep meditation called [[Yoga Nidra]] (''Sleep yoga'') can remain conscious while in delta-sleep.
Delta wave activity has also been purported to aid in the formation of declarative and explicit memory formation.
<ref name="Hobson, J. 2002"/>

==Cultural and religious role==

In [[Advaita Vedanta]], deep dreamless sleep is considered the highest state of consciousness. If one can stay aware/conscious while in deepest dreamless sleep, s/he can reach a superconscious state (known as ''turiya'').
This notion of paradoxical [[consciousness]] may be linked to high cortical activity which happens during the delta-sleep.
<ref>Sharma Arvind: Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta; State University of New York Press, 2004</ref>

==Pharmacology==

While most drugs that affect sleep do so by stimulating sleep onset, or disrupting REM sleep, a number of chemicals and drugs have been shown to alter delta wave activity.
* [[Delta sleep-inducing peptide]], as the name suggests, induces delta wave EEG activity.
* Alcohol reduces SWS delta wave activity, thereby restricting the release of [[growth hormone]] (GH) by the pituitary.<ref>Lands, William. "Alcohol, Slow Wave Sleep, and the Somatotropic Axis." Alcohol 18.2 (1999): 109-22.</ref>
* The muramyl peptide, muramyl dipeptide (MDP, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine) has been shown to increase delta wave activity during slow wave sleep.<ref>Davenne, D. M. "Enhancement of Quiet Sleep in Rabbit Neonates by Muramyl Dipeptide." Am J Physiol. 253.4 (1987): 646-54. Print.</ref>
* The drug [[Gabapentin]], a drug used to control epileptic seizures, increases delta-wave activity and slow wave sleep in adults.<ref>Foldvary-Schaefer, N., I. De Leon Sanchez, M. Karafa, D. Dinner, and H. H. Morris. "Gabapentin Increases Slow-wave Sleep in Normal Adults." Epilepsia 43.12 (2002): 1493-497. Print.</ref>
* While hypnotic drugs increase slow wave sleep, they do not increase delta wave activity, and instead increase spindle activity during slow wave sleep.<ref name="D'haenen, H. A. H. 2002">D'haenen, H. A. H., Johan A. Den Boer, and Paul Willner. Biological Psychiatry. Chichester: Wiley, 2002. Print.</ref>
* [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric_acid|Gamma-hydroxy butyrate]] (GHB) increases delta slow-wave sleep as well as sleep-related growth hormone (GH).<ref name="D'haenen, H. A. H. 2002"/>

==Effects of diet==

Diets very low in carbohydrates, such as a [[ketogenic diet]], have been shown to increase the amount of delta activity and slow wave sleep in healthy individuals.<ref>Afaghi, A. , O'Connor, H. , & Chow, C. (2008). Acute Effects of the Very Low Carbohydrate Diet on Sleep Indices. Nutritional Neuroscience, 11(4), 146-154.</ref>
