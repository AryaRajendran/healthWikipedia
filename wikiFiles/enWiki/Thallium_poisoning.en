[[Thallium]] and its compounds are often highly toxic.<ref name="urlToxicity, Thallium: Overview - eMedicine Emergency Medicine">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/821465-overview |title=Toxicity, Thallium: Overview - eMedicine Emergency Medicine |work= |accessdate=2009-03-06}}</ref><ref name="WebEl">{{cite web | url = http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Tl/biol.html | title = Biology of Thallium | publisher = webelemnts| accessdate = 2008-11-11}}</ref> Contact with skin is dangerous, and adequate ventilation should be provided when melting this metal.<ref name="WebEl"/> Many thallium(I) compounds are highly [[solubility|soluble]] in water and are readily absorbed through the skin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Exposure to them should not exceed 0.1 [[milligram|mg]] per m² of skin in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen.<ref name="WebEl"/>

Part of the reason for thallium's high toxicity is that, when present in aqueous solution as the univalent thallium(I) ion (Tl<sup>+</sup>), it exhibits some similarities with essential [[alkali metal]] cations, particularly [[potassium]] (due to similar atomic radii). It can thus enter the body via potassium uptake pathways.<ref>[http://www.aurorabiomed.com/download/presentations/pres09/Wei_Zheng.pdf A Homogenous Thallium Flux Assay for High Throughput Screen of Potassium Channels]</ref> Other aspects of thallium's chemistry differ strongly from that of the alkali metals, such its high affinity for [[sulfur]] ligands.  Thus this substitution disrupts many cellular processes (for instance, thallium may attack sulfur-containing proteins such as [[cysteine]] residues and [[ferredoxin]]s).<ref>[http://sites.google.com/site/vogteh/assignments/eliminatingthalliumpoisoning-bogdanmandzyuk <span dir="ltr">Eliminating Thallium (poisoning)</span>]</ref>
Thallium's toxicity has led to its use (now discontinued in many countries) as a [[rat]] and [[ant]] poison.<ref name="urlToxicity, Thallium: Overview - eMedicine Emergency Medicine"/> 

Among the distinctive effects of thallium poisoning are [[alopecia|loss of hair]] (which led to its initial use as a [[depilatory]] before its toxicity was properly appreciated) and damage to peripheral nerves (victims may experience a sensation of walking on hot coals), although the loss of hair only generally occurs in low doses; in high doses the thallium kills before this can take effect.<ref>Blum, The Poisoner's Handbook, 256</ref> Thallium was once an effective murder weapon before its effects became understood, and an antidote ([[Prussian blue]]) discovered.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = International Journal of Biochemistry |volume = 22 | issue = 5 | year = 1990 | pages = 429–438 | doi = 10.1016/0020-711X(90)90254-Z | title = Thallium in biochemistry | author = Douglas, K.

== Treatment and internal decontamination ==

Two of the main methods of removing thallium (both radioactive and normal) from humans is to use [[Prussian blue]], which is a solid [[ion exchange]] material, which absorbs thallium. Up to 20&nbsp;g per day of Prussian blue is fed by mouth to the person, and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the [[Human feces|stool]]. [[Hemodialysis]] and [[hemoperfusion]] are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum. At later stage of the treatment additional potassium is used to mobilize thallium from the tissue.<ref>[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/prussianblue.asp Prussian blue fact sheet] from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Malbrain, M.

==Bioconcentration==
According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), thallium release to the environment was reported in Texas and Ohio. This may indicate bioconcentration in aquatic ecosystems.[http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/dwh/t-ioc/thallium.html]

==Thallium compounds==
The [[odor]]less and [[taste]]less [[Thallium(I) sulfate|thallium sulfate]] was also used as [[rat poison]] and [[ant]] killer. Since 1975, this use in the [[United States]] and many other countries is prohibited due to safety concerns.<ref name="sl2001">{{cite web |title=Chemical fact sheet — Thallium | publisher=''Spectrum Laboratories'' | year=2001 | month=April | url=http://www.speclab.com/elements/thallium.htm | accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>

==Detection in body fluids==
Thallium may be quantitated in blood or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. Normal background blood and urine concentrations in healthy persons are usually less than 1 μg/L, but they are often in the 1–10&nbsp;mg/L range in survivors of acute intoxication.<ref>

== Famous uses as a poison ==

=== In real life ===
There are numerous recorded cases of fatal thallium poisoning.<ref>http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/thallium_is_favored_method_of.html</ref>
Because of its use for [[murder]], thallium has gained the nicknames "The Poisoner's Poison" and "Inheritance Powder" (alongside [[arsenic]]).

====Australia's "Thallium Craze"====

In [[Australia]] in the early 1950s there was a notable spate of cases of murder or attempted murder by thallium poisoning. At this time, due to the chronic rat infestation problems in overcrowded inner-city suburbs (notably in Sydney), and thallium's effectiveness as a rat poison, it was still readily available over the counter in New South Wales, where thallium sulphate was marketed as a commercial rat bait, under the brand "Thall-rat".

* In September 1952 [[Yvonne Gladys Fletcher]], a housewife and mother of two from the inner [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]] suburb of [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], was charged and tried for the murders of both her first husband, Desmond Butler (who died in 1948) and her abusive second husband, Bertrand "Bluey" Fletcher, a rat bait layer, from whom Yvonne had obtained the thallium poison that she used to kill him earlier that year. Suspicions were raised after it became obvious to friends and neighbours that Bluey Fletcher was suffering from the same fatal illness that had killed Yvonne's first husband. A police investigation led to the exhumation and testing of Desmond Butler's remains, which showed clear evidence of thallium, and this led to Yvonne being convicted of Butler's murder. She was sentenced to death, but this was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment after the NSW Government abolished the death penalty; she was eventually released in 1964. At the time of the trial, it was reported that this was the first known case in Australia of a person being convicted of murder by administering thallium.<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/18283164 ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 24 September 1952].

Retrieved 31 January 2013.</ref> The Fletcher case is also notable for the fact that one of the arresting officers was Sydney detective [[Fred Krahe]], who later became notorious for his suspected close involvement with elements of Sydney's organised crime scene and his alleged involvement in the disappearance of social activist [[Juanita Nielsen]].
* A month later, in October 1952, [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] grandmother Ruby Norton was tried for the murder of her daughter's fiance Allen Williams, who died of thallium poisoning at [[Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra]] Hospital in July 1952. Despite allegations that Norton hated all the men in her family and Williams was an unwanted son-in-law, Norton was acquitted.<ref>[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/post-war-days-of-thallium-and-old-lace/story-fn6ccwsa-1226060629402 Marea Donnelly, "Post-war days of thallium and old lace", ''Daily Telegraph'', 23 May 2011]. Retrieved 31 January 2013.</ref>
* Also in 1952, Sydney woman Veronica Monty, 45, was tried for the attempted murder of her son-in-law, noted [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] and Australian rugby league player [[Bob Lulham]], who was treated for thallium poisoning in 1952. After separating from her husband, Monty had moved in with her daughter Judy and Judy's husband, Bob Lulham. The sensational trial revealed that Lulham and Monty had an "intimate relationship" while Lulham's wife was at Sunday mass. Monty was found not guilty; Judy Lulham divorced her husband as a result of the revelations about his affair, and Veronica Monty killed herself with thallium in 1955.<ref>[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/post-war-days-of-thallium-and-old-lace/story-fn6ccwsa-1226060629402 Marea Donnelly, "Post-war days of thallium and old lace", ''Daily Telegraph'', 23 May 2011]. Retrieved 31 January 2013.</ref>
* In July 1953 Sydney woman Beryl Hague was tried for "maliciously administering thallium and endangering her husband's life". Hague confessed to buying Thall-rat from a corner shop and putting it in her husband's tea, because she wanted to "give him a headache to repay the many headaches he had given me" in violent disputes<ref>[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/post-war-days-of-thallium-and-old-lace/story-fn6ccwsa-1226060629402 Marea Donnelly, "Post-war days of thallium and old lace", ''Daily Telegraph'', 23 May 2011]. Retrieved 31 January 2013.</ref> 
* In 1953, [[Australia]]n [[Caroline Grills]] was sentenced to life in prison after three family members and a close family friend died. Authorities found thallium in tea that she had given to two additional family members. Grills spent the rest of her life in Sydney's Long Bay Gaol, where fellow inmates dubbed her "Aunt Thally".<ref>[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/post-war-days-of-thallium-and-old-lace/story-fn6ccwsa-1226060629402 Marea Donnelly, "Post-war days of thallium and old lace", ''Daily Telegraph'', 23 May 2011].

The Australian TV documentary ''[[Recipe for Murder (film)|Recipe for Murder]]'', released in 2011, examined three of the most sensational and widely-reported Australian thallium poisonings, the Fletcher, Monty and Grills cases.

====Other notable cases====

* In 1957, [[Nikolai Khokhlov]], a former [[KGB]] assassin, was poisoned with thallium.<ref name="mitro">{{cite book | author=[[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]] | title=The [[Mitrokhin Archive]]: The KGB in Europe and the West | publisher=Gardners Books | year=2000 | isbn=0-14-028487-7}}</ref> Khokhlov fell ill with stomach cramps and nausea; within days, his hair had fallen out and he was covered with marks on his skin. He fled the Soviet Union to Germany, where doctors suspected thallium poisoning and tried every known antidote without success. Khokhlov was then transferred to a hospital in the United States and treated with [[hydrocortisone]], [[steroid]]s, and blood and plasma transfusions.  He eventually recovered.
* In 1960, [[Félix-Roland Moumié]], a [[Cameroon]]ian leader, was assassinated in [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]] on 3 November 1960 by the [[SDECE]] (French secret service) with thallium.
* In 1971, thallium was the main poison that [[Graham Frederick Young]] used to poison around 70 people in the English village of [[Bovingdon]], [[Hertfordshire]], of whom 3 died.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2990.1991.tb00687.x | title = What have we learnt from Graham Frederick Young?

* In 1988, members of the Carr family from Alturas, [[Polk County, Florida]], fell ill from what appeared to be thallium poisoning.  Peggy Carr, the mother, died slowly and painfully from the poison. Her son and stepson were critically ill but eventually recovered.  The Carrs' neighbor, chemist [[George J. Trepal]], was convicted of murdering Mrs. Carr and attempting to murder her family and sentenced to death. The thallium was slipped into bottles of [[Coca-Cola]] at the Carr and Trepal homes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floridacapitalcases.state.fl.us/case_updates/121965.doc |title=The Case of TREPAL, George (W/M) |publisher=The Commission on Capital Cases |accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref>
* Thallium was the poison of choice for [[Saddam Hussein]] to use on dissidents, which even allowed for them to emigrate before dying.<ref>http://www.google.com/#q=thallium+saddam</ref>
* In 1995 [[Zhu Ling (poisoning victim)|Zhu Ling]] was the victim of an unsolved thallium poisoning in [[Beijing]], China. In 1994, Zhu Ling was a sophomore in Class Wuhua2 (Physical Chemistry) at [[Tsinghua University]] in Beijing. She began to show strange and debilitating symptoms at the end of 1994, when she reported experiencing acute stomach pain, along with extensive hair loss. Ultimately she was diagnosed on [[Usenet]] with poisoning by thallium. To this day, speculation on poisoner's identity is still discussed by many Chinese expatriates overseas. A High-rank officer is suspected to exert pressure to suspend police investigation in order to save a rumored Thallium Princess, who was the only suspect after police investigation.  The name of the suspect is Sun Wei who was Zhu Ling's classmate and roommate in Tsinghua University from 1992 to 1997. Tsinghua University also said she was the only student who would have had access to thallium compound at the school. The investigation result of the case has never been released to Zhu Ling's parents and general public. However, Tsinghua University denied to issue Sun Wei's B. S. certificate and refused to provide her document needed to get a passport or visa in 1997.
* In January 1999, 40 year old Inger Lise Bakken of [[Norway]] was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with thallium poisoning. She died in February, and ex-husband Terje Wiik was sentenced to 21 years in prison.  His intention was not killing, rather to stop her promiscuity by repeatedly poisoning her, the final time by adding the toxin to a bottle of [[cognac]], and continuously pretended ignorance as to what had caused her excruciating condition. He also gave her antidote as she got ill. He acquired the thallium through his job within the petroleum industry. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* In June 2004, 25 Russian soldiers earned Honorable Mentions in the [[Darwin Awards]] after becoming ill from thallium exposure when they found a can of mysterious white powder in a rubbish dump on their base at [[Khabarovsk]] in the Russian Far East. Oblivious to the danger of misusing an unidentified white powder from a military dump site, the conscripts added it to tobacco, and used it as a substitute for [[talcum powder]] on their feet.<ref>[http://darwinawards.com/stupid/stupid2004-16.html White Russians] at DarwinAwards.com</ref>

* In 2011, a chemist at [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] in [[New Jersey]], Li Tianle, was charged with the murder of her husband. According to an investigation by the [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]] Prosecutor's Office, Li Tianle was able to obtain a chemical containing thallium and feed it to her husband.<ref>[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/Death-by-Poison-NJ-Police-Charge-Woman-in-Death-of-her-Husband-115590444.html] NBC New York, February 8, 2011.</ref> Li was a chemistry student at Beijing University at the time of the highly publicized thallium poisoning of [[Zhu Ling (poisoning victim)|Zhu Ling]] in 1995 at neighboring Tsinghua University.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/thallium_is_favored_method_of.html ''A 15-year-old case yields a timely clue in deadly thallium poisoning''], NJ.com News, February 13, 2011.</ref>
* In September 2012, a 25 year-old chemistry graduate student at the University of Southampton, UK, was diagnosed with thallium poisoning approximately three weeks after falling ill with neurological symptoms. Although no definitive cause has been identified, the police have excluded accidental poisoning and suicide. As of March 2013, the student is still recovering from the extensive nerve damage caused by the poison.[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2013/03/southampton-university-cleared-thallium-arsenic-poisoning-student-recovering]

=== In fiction ===

* In Season 3 Episode 4 of [[The Shield]], Streaks and Tips, thallium is used by a man, who is trying to kill his brother, as he was just names as beneficiary, to pay of debts that are owned.  

* [[Ngaio Marsh]] used thallium acetate in her 1947 detective novel, ''[[Final Curtain]]''.
