An '''anastomosis''' (plural '''anastomoses''', from gr. ἀναστόμωσις, ''communicating opening'') is the reconnection of two streams that previously branched out, such as blood vessels or leaf veins. The term is used in [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[mycology]], [[geology]], [[geography]] and [[architecture]]. 

==Medicine==

Anastomosis is the connection of two structures.<ref>{{cite|author=Gylys, Barbara A. and Mary Ellen Wedding|title=Medical Terminology Systems|publisher=F.A. Davis Company|date=2005}}</ref> It refers to connections between [[blood vessel]]s or between other tubular structures such as loops of [[intestine]]. In [[circulatory anastomosis|circulatory anastomoses]], many arteries naturally anastomose with each other, for example the [[inferior epigastric artery]] and [[superior epigastric artery]].The circulatory anastomosis is further divided into arterial and venous anastomosis. Arterial anastomosis includes actual arterial anastomosis (e.g. palmar arch, plantar arch) and potential arterial anastomosis (e.g. coronary arteries and cortical branch of cerebral arteries). An example of [[surgical anastomosis]] occurs when a segment of intestine is resected and the two remaining ends are sewn or stapled together (anastomosed), for example [[Roux-en-Y anastomosis]]. The procedure is referred to as intestinal anastomosis.

[[Pathology|Pathological]] anastomosis results from trauma or disease and may involve [[vein]]s, [[artery|arteries]], or intestines. These are usually referred to as [[fistula]]s. In the cases of veins or arteries, traumatic fistulas usually occur between artery and vein. Traumatic intestinal fistulas usually occur between two loops of intestine (entero-enteric fistula) or intestine and [[skin]] (enterocutaneous fistula). [[Portacaval anastomosis]], by contrast, is an anastomosis between a vein of the [[portal circulation]] and a vein of the [[systemic circulation]], which allows blood to bypass the liver in patients with [[portal hypertension]], often resulting in [[hemorrhoids]], [[esophageal varices]], or [[caput medusae]].

===Evolution===
In [[evolution]], anastomosis is a recombination of evolutionary lineage. Conventional accounts of evolutionary lineage present themselves as the simple branching out of species into novel forms.  Under anastomosis, species might recombine after initial branching out, such as in the case of recent research which shows that ancestral populations along human and chimpanzee lineages may have interbred after an initial branching event.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Patterson | first = Nick | coauthors = ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | month = May | title = Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | pages = 1103–1108 | doi = 10.1038/nature04789 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7097/abs/nature04789.html | accessdate = 2006-09-18 | pmid = 16710306 | issue = 7097 }}</ref> The concept of anastomosis also applies to the theory of [[symbiogenesis]], in which new [[species]] emerge from the formation of novel symbiotic relationships.

===Mycology===
In [[mycology]], anastomosis is the fusion between branches of the same or different [[hyphae]].<ref>{{cite|author=Kendrick, Bryce|title=The Fifth Kingdom|publisher=Mycologue Publications|date=2001}}</ref> Hence the bifurcating fungal hyphae can form true reticulating networks. By sharing materials in the form of dissolved [[ions]], [[hormones]], and [[nucleotides]], the fungus maintains bidirectional communication with itself. The fungal network might begin from several origins; several spores (''i.e.'' by means of [[conidial anastomosis tubes]]), several points of penetration, each a spreading circumference of absorption and assimilation. Once encountering the tip of another expanding, exploring self, the tips press against each other in [[pheromonal recognition]] or by an unknown recognition system, fusing to form a genetic singular that can cover hectares called a [[Genet (biology)|genet]] or just microscopical areas.<ref>Glass, L.; Rasmussen, C.; Roca, M.G.; Read, N. (2004). Hyphal homing, fusion and mycelial interconnectedness. ''TRENDS in Microbiology'' '''12''': 135–141.</ref>

For fungi, anastomosis is also a component of [[sex]]. In some fungi, two different [[haploid]] mating types — if compatible — merge. [[Somatically]], they form a morphologically similar mycelial wave front that continues to grow and explore. The significant difference, is that in each [[septated]] unit is binucleate, containing two unfused [[cell nucleus|nuclei]], i.e. one from each parent that will eventually undergo [[karyogamy]] and meiosis to complete the sexual cycle.

==Geology==
In [[geology]], anastomosis refers to [[quartz]] (or other) [[Vein (geology)|veins]] displaying this property, which is often related to [[Shear (geology)|shearing]] in [[Metamorphism|metamorphic]] regions. 

==Geography==

Anastomosing streams are a type of organic-rich [[anabranch|anabranching river]] that consist of multiple channels that divide and reconnect and are separated by such cohesive material that they would likely not be able to [[channel migration|migrate]] from one channel position to another. Rivers with anastomosed reaches include the [[Magdalena River]] in [[Colombia]],<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0037-0738(86)90058-8|title=Anastomosing river deposits, sedimentation rates and basin subsidence, Magdalena River, northwestern Colombia, South America|year=1986|last1=Smith|first1=D|journal=Sedimentary Geology|volume=46|pages=177|issue=3–4}}</ref> the upper [[Columbia River]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]],<ref>Abbado, D., Slingerland, R.L., and Smith, N.D., 2005, The origin of anastomosis in the upper Columbia River, British Columbia, Canada: In Blum, M.D., Marriott, S., and Leclair.
