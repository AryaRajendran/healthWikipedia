'''ABVD''' is a [[chemotherapy regimen]] used in the first-line treatment of [[Hodgkin lymphoma]], supplanting the older [[Mustargen Oncovin Procarbazine Prednisone|MOPP]] protocol. It consists of concurrent treatment with the chemotherapy drugs:
*[[Adriamycin]] ([[doxorubicin]]/[[hydroxydaunorubicin]], the H in CHOP)
*[[Bleomycin]]
*[[Vinblastine]] 
*[[Dacarbazine]] (similar to [[procarbazine]], the P in [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP]])

==Indications==
As of 2007, ABVD is widely used as the initial chemotherapy treatment for newly diagnosed Hodgkin's lymphoma {{fact|date=July 2012}}. The other chemotherapy regimen that is widely used in this setting is the [[Stanford V]] regimen.

==History==
{{see also|History of cancer chemotherapy}}
Prior to the mid-1960s, advanced-stage Hodgkin disease was treated with single-agent [[chemotherapy]], with fairly dismal long-term survival and cure rates. With advances in the understanding of chemotherapy resistance and the development of [[history of cancer chemotherapy#Combination chemotherapy|combination chemotherapy]], [[Vincent T. DeVita]] and [[George Canellos]] at the [[National Cancer Institute]] (United States) developed the [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP]] regimen. This combination of [[mechlorethamine]], [[vincristine]] (Oncovin), [[procarbazine]], and [[prednisone]] proved capable of curing almost 70% of patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma.<ref>{{cite journal | author = DeVita V, Simon R, Hubbard S, Young R, Berard C, Moxley J, Frei E, Carbone P, Canellos G | title = Curability of advanced Hodgkin's disease with chemotherapy. Long-term follow-up of MOPP-treated patients at the National Cancer Institute | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 92 | issue = 5 | pages = 587–95 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6892984}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Longo D, Young R, Wesley M, Hubbard S, Duffey P, Jaffe E, DeVita V | title = Twenty years of MOPP therapy for Hodgkin's disease | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = 1295–306 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3528400}}</ref>

While MOPP was remarkably successful in curing advanced Hodgkin lymphoma, its [[toxicity]] remained significant. Aside from [[myelosuppression|bone marrow suppression]], frequent side effects included [[neurotoxicity|nerve injury]] caused by vincristine and [[allergic reaction]]s to procarbazine. Long-term effects were also a concern, as patients were often cured and could expect long survival after chemotherapy. [[Infertility]] was a major long-term side effect, and even more seriously, the risk of developing treatment-related [[myelodysplasia]] or [[acute leukemia]] was increased up to 14-fold in patients who received MOPP.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199001043220102 | author = Kaldor J, Day N, Clarke E, Van Leeuwen F, Henry-Amar M, Fiorentino M, Bell J, Pedersen D, Band P, Assouline D | title = Leukemia following Hodgkin's disease | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 322 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–13 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2403650}}</ref> These treatment-related [[hematological malignancies]] peaked at 5 to 9 years after treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and were associated with a dismally poor prognosis.

===Development of ABVD===
Therefore, alternate regimens were tested in an attempt to avoid [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]s (such as mechlorethamine), which were thought to be responsible for many of the long-term side effects of MOPP. ABVD was developed as a potentially less toxic and more effective alternative to MOPP; the initial results of ABVD regimen  were published at Università degli Studi di Milano,Facoltà di Medicina e Chirurgia, ( anno accademico : 1974/75 ) in  : 'Studio comparativo di due schemi di polichemioterapia negli stadi avanzati della Malattia di Hodgkin' , (relatore prof.  F. A . ), tesi di laurea di Fossati Vittorio , Matr. 81.606 ,(thesis of a student led by Bonadonna Gianni) and these initial results were also published in 1975  by an [[Italy|Italian]] group led by Bonadonna.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bonadonna G, Zucali R, Monfardini S, De Lena M, Uslenghi C | title = Combination chemotherapy of Hodgkin's disease with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and imidazole carboxamide versus MOPP. | journal = Cancer | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 252–9 | year = 1975 | pmid = 54209 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0142(197507)36:1<252::AID-CNCR2820360128>3.0.CO;2-7}}</ref> A number of trials then compared MOPP vs. MOPP plus ABVD<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bonadonna, G., Fossati, V., De Lena, M. | title =: MOPP versus MOPP plus ABVD in Stage IV Hodgkin's disease. | journal = Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res.-ASCO| volume = 19|pages = 363| year = 1978 }}</ref> and compared ABVD to previous and other regimens for Hodgkin lymphoma . A large trial by [[CALGB]] suggested that ABVD was superior to MOPP, with a higher rate of overall response, less hematologic toxicity, better relapse-free survival, and better outcomes after relapse in the patients treated with ABVD.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199211193272102 | author = Canellos G, Anderson J, Propert K, Nissen N, Cooper M, Henderson E, Green M, Gottlieb A, Peterson B | title = Chemotherapy of advanced Hodgkin's disease with MOPP, ABVD, or MOPP alternating with ABVD. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 327 | issue = 21 | pages = 1478–84 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1383821}}</ref> Later studies confirmed the superiority of ABVD in terms of effectiveness, and also demonstrated that late side effects, such as treatment-related acute leukemia, were less common with ABVD as compared to MOPP.<ref name="santoro">{{cite journal | author = Santoro A, Bonadonna G, Valagussa P, Zucali R, Viviani S, Villani F, Pagnoni A, Bonfante V, Musumeci R, Crippa F | title = Long-term results of combined chemotherapy-radiotherapy approach in Hodgkin's disease: superiority of ABVD plus radiotherapy versus MOPP plus radiotherapy. | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–37 | year = 1987 | pmid = 2433409}}</ref> Taken together, these results led ABVD to the replacement of MOPP with ABVD in the first-line treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma. A number of trials then compared ABVD or  ABVD-like or  hybrid MOPP/ABVD to BEACOPP and escalated BEACOPP  regimens .

==Administration==

One cycle of ABVD chemotherapy is typically given over 4 weeks, with two doses in each cycle (on day 1 and day 15). All four of the chemotherapy drugs are given [[intravenous]]ly. ABVD chemotherapy is usually given in the [[outpatient]] setting &mdash; that is, it does not require [[Inpatient care|hospitalization]].

Typical dosages for one 28-day cycle of ABVD are as follows
*[[Adriamycin]] 25&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 1 and 15
*[[Bleomycin]] 10,000 units/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 1 and 15
*[[Vinblastine]] 6&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 1 and 15
*[[Dacarbazine]] 375&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 1 and 15

The total number of cycles given depends upon the stage of the disease and how well the patient tolerates chemotherapy. Doses may be delayed because of [[neutropenia]], [[thrombocytopenia]], or other side effects.

A [[Fludeoxyglucose|FDG]] [[PET scan]] is commonly advised following the completion of ABVD to assess response to therapy.  Interim PET (following 2 cycles) may be useful in aiding prognostication, but does not yet guide changes in therapy except within clinical trial protocols.

==Side effects==

In the relative spectrum of cancer chemotherapy, ABVD is not a particularly toxic regimen. Side effects of ABVD can be divided into acute (those occurring while receiving chemotherapy) and delayed (those occurring months to years after completion of chemotherapy). Delayed side effects have assumed particular importance because many patients treated for Hodgkin lymphoma are cured and can expect long lives after completion of chemotherapy.

===Acute side effects===
*'''Hair loss''', or [[alopecia]], is a fairly common but not universal side effect of ABVD. Hair that is lost returns in the months after completion of chemotherapy.
*'''Nausea and vomiting''' can occur with ABVD, although treatments for [[chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting]] have improved substantially (see ''Supportive care'' below).
*'''Low blood counts''', or [[myelosuppression]], occur about 50% of the time with ABVD. Blood cell [[G-CSF|growth factors]] are sometimes used to prevent this (see ''Supportive care'' below). Blood counts are checked frequently while receiving chemotherapy. Any fever or sign of infection that develops needs to be promptly evaluated; severe infections can develop rapidly in a person with a low [[white blood cell]] count due to chemotherapy.
*'''Allergic reactions''' to bleomycin can occur. A small test dose of bleomycin is often given prior to the first round of ABVD to screen for patients who may be allergic.
*'''Neuropathy''' Numbness in tips of fingers and toes,  this can be temporary or permanent.

===Delayed side effects===
*'''Infertility''' is probably infrequent with ABVD. Several studies have suggested that, while [[sperm count]]s in men decrease during chemotherapy, they return to normal after completion of ABVD.<ref name="santoro"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Viviani S, Santoro A, Ragni G, Bonfante V, Bestetti O, Bonadonna G | title = Gonadal toxicity after combination chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease. Comparative results of MOPP vs ABVD | journal = Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 601–5 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2408897 | doi = 10.1016/0277-5379(85)90088-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Anselmo A, Cartoni C, Bellantuono P, Maurizi-Enrici R, Aboulkair N, Ermini M | title = Risk of infertility in patients with Hodgkin's disease treated with ABVD vs MOPP vs ABVD/MOPP | journal = Haematologica | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–8 | year = 1990| pmid = 1694156}}</ref> In women, [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] levels remained normal while receiving ABVD, suggesting preserved ovarian function. Regardless of these data, fertility options (e.g. [[sperm bank]]ing) should be discussed with an [[oncologist]] before beginning ABVD therapy.
*'''Pulmonary toxicity''', or [[lung]] damage, can occur with the use of [[bleomycin]] in ABVD, especially when [[radiation therapy]] to the chest is also given as part of the treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma. This toxicity develops months to years after completing chemotherapy, and usually manifests as [[cough]] and [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]]. High concentrations of oxygen, such as those often used in surgery, can trigger lung damage in patients who have received bleomycin, even years later. [[Pulmonary function test]]s are often used to assess for bleomycin-related damage to the lungs. One study found bleomycin lung damage in 18% of patients receiving ABVD for Hodgkin disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Martin W, Ristow K, Habermann T, Colgan J, Witzig T, Ansell S | title = Bleomycin pulmonary toxicity has a negative impact on the outcome of patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 23 | issue = 30 | pages = 7614–20 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16186594 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.7243}}</ref> Retrospective analyses have questioned whether bleomycin is necessary at all;<ref>{{cite journal | author = Canellos G, Duggan D, Johnson J, Niedzwiecki D | title = How important is bleomycin in the adriamycin + bleomycin + vinblastine + dacarbazine regimen? | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 22 | issue = 8 | pages = 1532–3 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15084636 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2004.99.010}}</ref> however, at this point it remains a standard part of ABVD.
*'''Cardiac toxicity''', or [[cardiomyopathy]], can be a late side effect of [[adriamycin]]. The occurrence of adriamycin-related cardiac toxicity is related to the total lifetime dose of adriamycin, and increases sharply in people who receive a cumulative dose of more than 400&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>. Almost all patients treated with ABVD receive less than this dose (for 6 cycles of ABVD, the cumulative adriamycin dose is 300&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>); therefore, adriamycin-related cardiac toxicity is very uncommon with ABVD.
*'''Secondary malignancies'''. Patients cured of Hodgkin lymphoma remain at increased risk of developing other (secondary) cancers. Treatment-related [[leukemia]]s are uncommon with ABVD, especially as compared with MOPP.<ref name="santoro"/> However, one study found a risk of second cancers as high as 28% at 25 years after treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, although most of the patients in this study were treated with [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP]] chemotherapy rather than ABVD.<ref>{{cite journal | author = van Leeuwen F, Klokman W, Veer M, Hagenbeek A, Krol A, Vetter U, Schaapveld M, van Heerde P, Burgers J, Somers R, Aleman B | title = Long-term risk of second malignancy in survivors of Hodgkin's disease treated during adolescence or young adulthood | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 487–97 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10653864}}</ref> Many of these second cancers were lung cancers or, in women, breast cancers, emphasizing the importance of [[smoking cessation]] and regular [[preventive care]] after completion of treatment. Radiation and chemotherapy probably both play a role in the development of these secondary malignancies; the exact contribution of chemotherapy such as ABVD can be difficult to tease out.

==Supportive care==

''Supportive care'' refers to efforts to prevent or treat side effects of ABVD chemotherapy, and to help patients get through the chemotherapy with the least possible discomfort.

===Antiemetics===
Significant advances in [[antiemetic]], or anti-nausea, medications have been made in the beginning of the 21st century. Patients will often receive a combination of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists (e.g. [[ondansetron]]), [[corticosteroid]]s, and [[benzodiazepine]]s before chemotherapy to prevent nausea. These medicines are also effective after nausea develops, as are [[phenothiazine]]s. Each person's sensitivity to nausea and vomiting varies. Overall, while patients often experience some mild to moderate nausea, severe nausea or vomiting are uncommon with ABVD.

Emetogenicity: '''HIGH'''
The following protocol is recommended by EVIQ:
Aprepitant 125 mg day 1 then 80 mg day 2 and 3 AND 
Dexamethasone 12 mg day 1 then 8 mg daily up to 4 days post chemotherapy AND 
5HT3 antagonist day 1. 

Ensure that patients have sufficient antiemetics for breakthrough emesis: 
Metoclopramide 10 mg to 20 mg every 4 to 6 hours when necessary OR 
Prochlorperazine 10 mg PO or 12.5 mg IV every 4 to 6 hours when necessary.

===Growth factors===
Blood growth factors are medicines that stimulate the [[bone marrow]] to produce more of a certain kind of [[blood cell]]. Commonly used examples include [[G-CSF]] and [[erythropoietin]]. These drugs are sometimes used with ABVD to prevent [[neutropenia]] (low [[white blood cell]] count) and [[anemia]] related to the chemotherapy, although their use is not universal.
