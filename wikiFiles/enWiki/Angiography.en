'''Angiography''' or '''arteriography''' is a [[medical imaging]] technique used to visualize the inside, or [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], of blood vessels and organs of the body, with particular interest in the [[artery|arteries]], [[vein]]s and the [[heart chamber]]s. This is traditionally done by injecting a radio-opaque [[radiocontrast|contrast agent]] into the blood vessel and imaging using [[X-ray]] based techniques such as [[fluoroscopy]].

The word itself comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''angeion'', "vessel",  and ''graphein'', "to write" or "record". The film or image of the [[blood vessel]]s is called an ''angiograph'', or more commonly, an ''angiogram''. Though the word itself can describe both an '''arteriogram''' and a '''[[venogram]]''', in its everyday usage, the terms angiogram and arteriogram are often used synonymously, whereas the term venogram is used more precisely.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arteriograms, Venograms Are Angiogram Territory|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-01-23/features/8601060680_1_bleeding-arteries-angiography|accessdate=12 September 2011|author=G. Timothy Johnson, M.D|work=Chicago Tribune|date=1986-01-23}}</ref>

The term ''angiography'' is strictly defined as based on [[projectional radiography]]; however, the term has been applied to newer vascular imaging techniques such as [[Computed tomography angiography|CT angiography]] and [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MR angiography]]. The term ''isotope angiography'' has also been used, although this more correctly is referred to as [[Perfusion_scanning#NM_Perfusion|isotope perfusion scanning]].

==History==
	The technique was first developed in 1927 by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] physician and neurologist [[Egas Moniz]] at the [[University of Lisbon]] to provide contrasted x-ray [[cerebral angiography]] in order to diagnose several kinds of nervous diseases, such as tumors, artery disease and [[arteriovenous malformations]]. He is usually recognized as one of the pioneers in this field. Moniz performed the first cerebral angiogram in Lisbon in 1927, and [[Reynaldo Cid dos Santos]] performed the first aortogram in the same city in 1929. With the introduction of the [[Seldinger technique]] in 1953, the procedure became markedly safer as no sharp introductory devices needed to remain inside the vascular lumen.

==Technique==

Depending on the type of angiogram, access to the blood vessels is gained most commonly through the [[femoral artery]], to look at the left side of the heart and at the [[artery|arterial system]]; or the [[jugular]] or [[femoral vein]], to look at the right side of the heart and at the venous system.  Using a system of [[guide wire]]s and [[catheters]], a type of [[contrast agent]] (which shows up by absorbing the x-rays), is added to the blood to make it visible on the x-ray images. 

The [[X-ray]] images taken may either be still images, displayed on an [[image intensifier]] or film, or motion images.  For all structures except the heart, the images are usually taken using a technique called [[digital subtraction angiography]] or DSA. Images in this case are usually taken at 2 - 3 frames per second, which allows the [[interventional radiologist]] to evaluate the flow of the blood through a vessel or vessels.  This technique "subtracts" the bones and other organs so only the vessels filled with contrast agent can be seen.  The heart images are taken at 15-30 frames per second, not using a subtraction technique.  Because DSA requires the patient to remain motionless, it cannot be used on the heart.    Both these techniques enable the [[interventional radiologist]] or cardiologist to see [[stenosis]] (blockages or narrowings) inside the vessel which may be inhibiting the flow of blood and causing pain.

==Uses==

===Coronary angiography===
{{main|Coronary angiography}}
One of most common angiograms performed is to visualize the blood in the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]]. A long, thin, flexible tube called a [[catheter]] is used to administer the x-ray contrast agent at the desired area to be visualized. The catheter is threaded into an artery in the [[forearm]], and the tip is advanced through the arterial system into the major coronary artery.  [[X-ray]] images of the transient [[radiocontrast]] distribution within the blood flowing within the coronary arteries allows visualization of the size of the artery [[lumen (anatomy)|openings]]. Presence or absence of [[atherosclerosis]] or [[atheroma]] within the walls of the [[artery|arteries]] cannot be clearly determined. See [[coronary catheterization]] for more detail.

===Microangiography===
[[Microangiography]] is commonly used to visualize tiny blood vessels.

===Neuro-vascular angiography===
Another increasingly common angiographic procedure is neuro-vascular [[digital subtraction angiography]] in order to visualise the arterial and venous supply to the brain. Intervention work such as coil-embolisation of [[aneurysm]]s and [[Arteriovenous malformation|AVM]] gluing can also be performed.

===Peripheral angiography===
{{main|Peripheral artery occlusive disease}}
Angiography is also commonly performed to identify vessel [[stenosis|narrowing]] in patients with leg claudication or ''cramps'', caused by reduced blood flow down the legs and to the feet; in patients with renal stenosis (which commonly causes high blood pressure) and can be used in the head to find and repair stroke. These are all done routinely through the femoral artery, but can also be performed through the brachial or axillary (arm) artery.  Any stenoses found may be treated by the use of [[atherectomy]].

===Post mortem CT angiography for medicolegal cases===

Post mortem CT angiography for medicolegal cases is a method initially developed by the [[Virtopsy]] group. Originating from that project, both watery<ref name="p18430859">{{cite journal |author=Ross S, Spendlove D, Bolliger S, Christe A, Oesterhelweg L, Grabherr S, Thali MJ, Gygax E.|title=Postmortem whole-body CT angiography: evaluation of two contrast media solutions.|journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol.|volume=190 |issue=5 |pages=1380–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18430859}}</ref> and oily<ref name="p17056884">{{cite journal |author=Grabherr S, Djonov V, Friess A, Thali MJ, Ranner G, Vock P, Dirnhofer R.|title=Postmortem angiography after vascular perfusion with diesel oil and a lipophilic contrast agent.|journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol.|volume=187 |issue=5 |pages=W515-23 |year=2006 |pmid=17056884}}</ref> solutions have been evaluated.

Watery solutions also were documented to enhance post mortem CT tissue differentiation whereas oily solutions were not. Conversely, oily solutions seem to only minimally disturb ensuing toxicological analysis, while watery solutions may significantly impede toxicological analysis, thus requiring blood sample preservation before post mortem CT angiography.<ref name="p22704555">{{cite journal |author=Rutty GN, Smith P, Visser T, Barber J, Amorosa J, Morgan B.|title=The effect on toxicology, biochemistry and immunology investigations by the use of targeted post-mortem computed tomography angiography.|journal=Forensic Sci Int.|year=2012 |pmid=22704555}}</ref>

==Complications==

===Coronary angiography===
Coronary angiographies are common and major complications are rare. These include [[cardiac arrhythmias]], [[renal failure|kidney damage]], blood clots (which can cause heart attack or stroke), [[hypotension]] and [[pericardial effusion]]. Minor complications can include [[bleeding]] or [[bruising]] at the site where the contrast is injected, blood vessel damage on the route to the heart from the catheter (rare) and [[allergic reaction]] to the contrast.<ref name='nhs-angiography-complications'>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Angiography/Pages/Complications.aspx |title=Angiography - Complications |accessdate=2010-03-24 |date=2009-06-01 |work=Health A-Z |publisher=NHS Choices }}</ref>

===Cerebral angiography===
Major complications in cerebral angiography are also rare but include [[stroke]], an [[allergic]] reaction to the [[anaesthetic]] other medication or the contrast medium, blockage or damage to one of the access veins in the leg, or [[thrombosis]] and [[embolism]] formation. [[Bleeding]] or [[bruising]] at the site where the contrast is injected are minor complications, delayed bleeding can also occur but is rare.<ref name='nhs-angiography-complications' />

===Additional Risks===

==In popular culture==
The horror movie ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973) featured a scene in which the protagonist, a young girl, is subjected to carotid angiography. The scene was portrayed accurately by medical personnel—rather than actors—who regularly performed the procedure in real life. Although the movie as a whole is often cited as one of the most frightening motion pictures of all time, this angiography scene was the scene most likely to upset audiences, according to the director, [[William Friedkin]].
