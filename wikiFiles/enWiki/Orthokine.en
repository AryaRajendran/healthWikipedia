'''Orthokine''' is an experimental medical procedure in which a patient's own blood is extracted, manipulated, and then reintroduced to the body as an [[anti-inflammatory drug]] to reduce [[chronic pain]] and [[osteoarthritis]].<ref name=leher>{{cite news|last=Lehrer|first=Jonah|title=Why Did Kobe Go to Germany?|date=April 11, 2012|work=grantland.com|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7796225/kobe-bryant-dr-chris-renna-regenokine-knee-treatment|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69umIQY7v|archivedate=August 14, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nick Young: Gilbert Arenas Got ‘That Kobe Treatment on His Knees’|date=February 2, 2012|work=slamonline.com|publisher=Source Interlink Magazines, LLC|url=http://www.slamonline.com/online/nba/2012/02/nick-young-gilbert-arenas-got-that-kobe-treatment-on-his-knees/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69umQb1z5|archivedate=August 14, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name=kyler>{{cite news|last=Kyler|first=Steve|title=NBA AM: The Next Nightmare In The NBA|date=August 15, 2012|work=hoopsworld.com|publisher= USA Today|url=http://www.hoopsworld.com/nba-am-the-next-nightmare-in-the-nba/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69yNwNODi|archivedate=August 16, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> Known in the United States as '''Regenokine''',<ref>{{cite news|last=Hale|first=Mark|title=Yankees say A-Rod had shoulder treatment, too|date=December 29, 2011|newspaper=New York Post|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/rod_shoulder_had_treatment_too_Xm56jA8eHibHuKvzdBhcxM|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69umb41Fd|archivedate=August 14, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> the process removes about {{convert|2|USoz|ml}} of blood from a patient's arm, which is then incubated at a slightly raised temperature.<ref name=leher/><ref name=puma>{{cite news|last=Puma|first=Mike|title=Yankees' A-Rod saw German doctors on advice from Kobe|date=December 28, 2011|newspaper=New York Post|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/rod_goes_global_for_knee_therapy_BWap0W9IRfSkRIVybErb5J|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69unPXI8a|archivedate=August 14, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name=graphic>{{cite news|title=Graphic: Unique knee surgery|date=August 22, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-spt-web-urlacher-xnx.eps-20120821,0,2729652.graphic|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AASOJZat|archivedate=August 24, 2012|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The liquid is then placed in a [[centrifuge]] until its constituent parts are separated.

Orthokine is a patented method developed by  [[molecular biologist]] Dr. [[Julio Reinecke]] and Dr. [[Peter Wehling]], a [[spinal surgeon]] in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany.<ref name=kyler/><ref name=thompson/>  A two-year study of osteoarthritis of the knee, published in the medical journal ''[[Osteoarthritis and Cartilage]]'', confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the therapy.<ref name=medicalnewstoday/> Orthokine is less invasive than most, if not all, other forms of [[knee surgery|knee surgeries]] available.<ref>{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Matt|title=Report: Andrew Bynum to have 'Kobe treatment' in Germany in September|date=August 17, 2012|work=cbssports.com|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/19789626/report-andrew-bynum-to-have-german-orthokine-kobe-treatment-in-september|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69zxXrAVl|archivedate=August 17, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> It focuses on treating the inflammation as opposed to mechanical problems in the joints.<ref name=kulish/> Orthokine was first approved for widespread use in Germany in 2003.<ref name=mitchell>{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=John N.|title=Bynum's knee treatment gains acceptance in U.S.|date=August 18, 2012|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-18/sports/33249379_1_regenokine-andrew-bynum-joint-replacement|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AAToFUE8|archivedate=August 24, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> Most patients have reported positive results.<ref name=kyler/><ref name=medicalnewstoday>{{cite news|title=Orthokine Treatment Is Effective For Knee Arthritis, Even After Two Years - Long-Study Confirms Effectiveness Of Autologous Therapy|date=August 5, 2008|work=medicalnewstoday.com|publisher=MediLexicon International Ltd|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/117165.php|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69yR68eSZ|archivedate=August 16, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> Orthokine differs from a similar procedure with [[platelet-rich plasma]] (PRP), where [[platelets]] are targeted instead of the interleukin antagonist.<ref>{{cite news|last=Trudell|first=Mike|title=The Trainer's Take: Part Two|date=August 20, 2012|work=nba.com|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/120608trainerstake_parttwo|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A4L86fg5|archivedate=August 20, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> Platelets are thought to speed the healing process.

As of August 2012, about 60,000 patients worldwide have received the treatment.<ref name=mitchell/> Americans have traveled to Germany for the treatment, which has not been approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref name=leher/><ref name=thompson/> Two offices, one in in New York and another in Los Angeles, have licenses to provide a similar treatment, but they cannot advertise due to the lack of FDA approval. Dr. [[Freddie Fu]], a professor of orthopedic surgery at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], said more high-quality independent trials proving the procedure's effectiveness are needed before the FDA approves.<ref name=kulish/> Wehling said the procedure has a 75% success rate and follows all regulations set by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]].<ref name=birkett/> [[National Basketball Association]] star [[Kobe Bryant]], who traveled to Germany to have the procedure performed by Wehling, is one famous case based on his recovery from his previously poor knees.<ref name=leher/><ref name=kyler/><ref name=puma/> Some basketball fans refer to the procedure as the "Kobe Procedure".<ref name=kyler/>

The procedure cost €6,000 (about $7,400) as of July 2012.<ref name=kulish/> The treatment is not covered by [[health insurance]]. Chris Renna, a [[preventive medicine]] specialist who has referred American patients to Wehling since 2003, said that "because of its expense and status, the treatment is for the 1 and 2 percent of our society."<ref name=mitchell/>
