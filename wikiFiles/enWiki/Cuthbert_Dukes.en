'''Cuthbert Esquire Dukes, M.D.''' [[OBE]] (1890–1977) was an English [[physician]] and [[pathologist]] and author for whom the [[Dukes classification]] for colorectal cancer is named.

Born in [[Bridgwater]], [[Somerset]], Dukes was educated at [[Caterham School]] and graduated with an [[M.D.]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1914. His field of choice was pathology and he would make many great contributions to the world of medicine over the course of his career. He served in the [[RAMC|Royal Army Medical Corps]] that was attached to the Rifle Brigade during [[World War I]] and was awarded the OBE for his services. After the war's end he became a demonstrator in [[bacteriology]] at [[University College, London|University College]] in London, and in 1922, was the first pathologist to join the staff of [[St. Mark's Hospital]]. It was there that he began his recognized studies on the pathology of [[colon cancer]]. He wrote several books based on his findings.

A meticulous researcher who took personal pleasure in the many cases in which his findings helped patients with colon cancer, Dukes, apparently in accordance to his humble [[Quaker]] faith, refused all honors despite the wishes of his former colleagues and lived quietly at his home in [[Wimbledon, England|Wimbledon]] until his death at the age of 86.

He was the younger brother of British playwright [[Ashley Dukes]] and [[MI6]] agent [[Paul Dukes|Sir Paul Dukes]].
