'''Autoimmune hemolytic anemia''' (or '''autoimmune haemolytic anaemia'''; '''AIHA''') occurs when antibodies directed against the person's own [[red blood cell]]s (RBCs) cause them to burst (lyse), leading to insufficient plasma concentration. The lifetime of the RBCs is reduced from the normal 100–120 days to just a few days in serious cases.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shoenfield|first=Y, ''et al''|title=Diagnostic Criteria in Autoimmune Disease|year=2008|publisher=Humana Press}}</ref><ref name=Sawitsky70>{{cite journal |author=Sawitsky A, Ozaeta PB |title=Disease-associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia |journal=Bull N Y Acad Med |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=411–26 |year=1970 |month=June |pmid=5267234 |pmc=1749710 }}</ref> The intracellular components of the RBCs are released into the circulating blood and into tissues, leading to some of the characteristic symptoms of this condition.

The terminology used in this disease is somewhat ambiguous.

==Classification==
AIHA is classified as either [[warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] or cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which includes [[cold agglutinin disease]], and [[paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria]]. These classifications are based on the characteristics of the autoantibodies involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Each has a different underlying cause, management and prognosis, making classification important when treating a patient with AIHA.

==Causes==
The causes of AIHA are poorly understood. The disease may be primary, or secondary to another underlying illness. The primary illness is [[idiopathic]] (the two terms being used synonymously). Idiopathic AIHA accounts for approximately 50% of cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gupta S, Szerszen A, Nakhl F, ''et al.'' |title=Severe refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia with both warm and cold autoantibodies that responded completely to a single cycle of rituximab: a case report |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=5 |pages=156 |year=2011 |pmid=21504611 |pmc=3096571 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-5-156 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/5//156}}</ref> Secondary AIHA can result from many other illnesses. Warm and cold type AIHA each have their own more common secondary causes. The most common causes of secondary warm-type AIHA include lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g. [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], [[lymphoma]]) and other autoimmune disorders (e.g. [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[scleroderma]], [[ulcerative colitis]]). Less common causes of warm-type AIHA include neoplasms other than lymphoid, and infection. Secondary cold type AIHA is also primarily caused by lymphoproliferative disorders, but is also commonly caused by infection, especially by mycoplasma, viral pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis and other respiratory infections. Less commonly, it can be caused by concomitant autoimmune disorders.<ref name=Sokol81/>

Drug-induced AIHA, though rare, can be caused by a number of drugs, including [[methyldopa|α-methyldopa]] and [[penicillin]]. This is a [[type II hypersensitivity|type II immune response]] in which the drug binds to [[macromolecule]]s on the surface of the RBCs and acts as an antigen. Antibodies are produced against the RBCs, which leads to complement activation. Complement fragments, such as C3a, C4a and C5a, activate granular leukocytes (e.g. neutrophils), while other components of the system (C6, C7, C8, C9) can either form the membrane attack complex (MAC) or can bind the antibody, aiding phagocytosis by [[macrophage]]s (C3b). This is one type of "penicillin allergy".

==Pathophysiology==
AIHA can be caused by a number of different classes of antibody, with [[IgG]] and [[IgM]] antibodies being the main causative classes. Depending on which is involved, the [[pathology]] will differ. IgG is not very effective at activating [[complement system|complement]] and effectively binds the [[Fc receptor]] (FcR) of [[phagocytosis|phagocytic cells]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Abramson N, Gelfand EW, Jandl JH, Rosen FS |title=The interaction between human monocytes and red cells. Specificity for IgG subclasses and IgG fragments |journal=J. Exp. Med. |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=1207–15 |year=1970 |month=December |pmid=5511570 |pmc=2180500 |doi=10.1084/jem.132.6.1207 }}</ref> AIHA involving IgG is generally characterized by phagocytosis of RBCs. IgM is a potent activator of the [[classical complement pathway]], thus, AIHA involving IgM is characterized by complement mediated lysis of RBCs. IgM also leads to phagocytosis of RBCs however, because phagocytic cells have receptors for the bound complement (rather than FcRs as in IgG AIHA). IgG AIHA generally takes place in the [[spleen]], while IgM AIHA takes place in [[Kupffer cells]] – phagocytic cells of the [[liver]]. Phagocytic AIHA is termed extravascular, while complement mediated lysis of RBCs is termed intravascular AIHA. In order for intravascular AIHA to be recognizable it requires overwhelming complement activation, therefore most AIHA is extravascular – be it IgG or IgM mediated.<ref name=Gehrs02/>

AIHA cannot be attributed to any single autoantibody. To determine the autoantibody or autoantibodies present in a patient, the [[Coombs test]], also known as the antiglobulin test, is performed . There are two types of Coombs test, direct and indirect; more commonly, the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is used. Classification of the antibodies is based on their activity at different temperatures and their aetiology. Antibodies with high activity at physiological temperature (approximately 37°C) are termed warm autoantibodies. Cold autoantibodies act best at temperatures of 0–4°C. Patients with cold-type AIHA, therefore, have higher disease activity when body temperature falls into a hypothermic state. Usually, the antibody becomes active when it reaches the limbs, at which point it opsonizes RBCs. When these RBCs return to central regions, they are damaged by complement. Patients may present with one or both types of autoantibodies; if both are present, the disease is termed "mixed-type" AIHA.

When DAT is performed, the typical presentations of AIHA are as follows. Warm-type AIHA shows a positive reaction with [[antiserum|antisera]] to IgG antibodies with or without complement activation. Cases may also arise with complement alone or with [[IgA]], IgM or a combination of these three antibody classes and complement. Cold type AIHA usually reacts with antisera to complement and occasionally to the above antibodies. This is the case in both cold agglutinin disease and cold paroxysmal hematuria. Mixed warm and cold AIHA generally shows a positive reaction to IgG and complement, sometimes IgG alone and sometimes complement alone. Mixed type can, like the others, present unusually with positive reactions to other antisera.<ref name=Sokol81>{{cite journal |author=Sokol RJ, Hewitt S, Stamps BK |title=Autoimmune haemolysis: an 18-year study of 865 cases referred to a regional transfusion centre |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=282 |issue=6281 |pages=2023–7 |year=1981 |month=June |pmid=6788179 |pmc=1505955 |doi=10.1136/bmj.282.6281.2023 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made by first ruling out other causes of hemolytic anemia, such as [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|G6PD]], [[thalassemia]], [[sickle-cell disease]], etc. Clinical history is also important to elucidate any underlying illness or medications which may have led to the disease. 

Following this, laboratory investigations are carried out to determine the etiology of the disease. A positive DAT test has poor specificity for AIHA (having many differential diagnoses); so supplemental serological testing is required to ascertain the cause of the positive reaction. Hemolysis must also be demonstrated in the lab. The typical tests used for this are a CBC with peripheral smear, bilirubin, LDH (in particular with isoenzyme 1), haptoglobin and urine hemoglobin.<ref name=Gehrs02/>

==Treatment==
Much literature exists regarding the treatment of AIHA. Efficacy of treatment depends on the correct diagnosis of either warm or cold type AIHA.

Warm type AIHA is usually a more insidious disease, not treatable by simply removing the underlying cause. First line therapy for this is usually with [[corticosteroid]]s, such as [[prednisolone]]. Following this, other immunosuppressants are considered, such as [[rituximab]], [[danazol]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[azathioprine]] or [[cyclosporine]].

Cold agglutinin disease is treated by avoiding the cold or sometimes with rituximab. Removal of the underlying cause is also important.

Paroxysmal cold hematuria is treated by removing the underlying cause, such as infection.

==History==
"Blood-induced icterus" produced by the release of massive amounts of a coloring material from blood cells followed by the formation of bile was recognized and described by Vanlair and Masius' in 1871. About 20 years later, Hayem distinguished between congenital hemolytic anemia and an acquired type of infectious icterus associated with chronic splenomegaly. In 1904, Donath and Landsteiner suggested a serum factor was responsible for hemolysis in paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. French investigators led by Chauffard stressed the importance of red-cell [[autoagglutination]] in patients with acquired hemolytic anemia. In 1930, Lederer and Brill described cases of acute [[hemolysis]] with rapid onset of anemia and rapid recovery after transfusion therapy. These hemolytic episodes were thought to be due to infectious agents. A clear distinction between congenital and acquired hemolytic anemia was not drawn, however, until Dameshek and Schwartz in 1938, and in 1940, they demonstrated the presence of abnormal hemolysins in the sera of patients with acquired [[hemolytic anemia]] and postulated an [[immunology|immune mechanism]].

During the past three decades, studies defining red-cell blood groups and serum antibodies have produced diagnostic methods that have laid the basis for immunologic concepts relevant to many of the acquired hemolytic states. Of these developments, the antiglobulin test described by Coombs, Mourant, and Race in 1945 has proved to be one of the more important, useful tools now available for the detection of immune hemolytic states. This technique demonstrated that a rabbit antibody against human globulin would induce agglutination of human red cells "coated with an incomplete variety of rhesus antibody".  C. Moreschlit had used the same method in  1908 in a goat antirabbit-red-cell system. The test was historically premature and was forgotten. In 1946, Boorman, Dodd, and Loutit applied the direct antiglobulin test to a variety of hemolytic anemias, and laid the foundation for the clear distinction of autoimmune from congenital hemolytic anemia.

A hemolytic state exists whenever the red cell survival time is shortened from the normal average of 120 days. Hemolytic anemia is the hemolytic state in which anemia is present, and bone marrow function is inferentially unable to compensate for the shortened life-span of the red cell. Immune hemolytic states are those, both anemic and nonanemic, which involve immune mechanisms consisting of antigen-antibody reactions. These reactions may result from unrelated antigen-antibody complexes that fix to an innocent-bystander erythrocyte, or from related antigen-antibody combinations in which the host red cell or some part of its structure is or has become antigenic. The latter type of antigen-antibody reaction may be termed "autoimmune", and hemolytic anemias so produced are autoimmune hemolytic anemias.<ref name=Sawitsky70/>

==In children==
AIHA in children generally has a good prognosis and is self-limiting. However, if it presents within the first two years of life or in the teenage years, the disease often follows a more [[chronic disease|chronic course]], requiring long term [[immunosuppression]], with serious developmental consequences. The aim of therapy may sometimes be to lower the use of steroids in the control of the disease. In this case, [[splenectomy]] may be considered, as well as other immunosuppressive drugs. Infection is a serious concern in patients on long-term immunosuppressant therapy, especially in very young children (less than two years).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zecca M, Nobili B, Ramenghi U, ''et al.'' |title=Rituximab for the treatment of refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia in children |journal=Blood |volume=101 |issue=10 |pages=3857–61 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12531800 |doi=10.1182/blood-2002-11-3547 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12531800}}</ref>
