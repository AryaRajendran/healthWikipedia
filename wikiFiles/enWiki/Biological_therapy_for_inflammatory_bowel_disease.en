Although the causes of these diseases are unknown, genetic, environmental, immune and other mechanisms have been proposed. Of these, the immune system plays a large role in the development of symptoms.<ref name=Podolsky/>  Given this, a variety of biological therapies have been developed for the treatment of these diseases.  These have changed the way physicians treat Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.<ref name=ACCENT1/><ref name =ACT/>

==Rationale for biological therapy==
[[Image:Cytokines in IBD.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cytokine]]s involved in IBD]]

Prior to the development of biological therapy as a modality to treat IBD, other medications that modulate the immune system—including [[5-aminosalicylate]]s, [[prednisone|steroids]], [[azathioprine]], and other immunosuppressants—were primarily used in treatment.<ref name=Hanauer/>  Patients with Crohn's disease that developed complications, including [[fistula]]e (= abnormal connections to the bowel) were treated with surgery.<!--

-->Patients with ulcerative colitis who do not respond to medications are still treated with [[colectomy]] (= removal of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]).

However, basic science research showed that there were many [[cytokine]]s that were elevated in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.<!--

==Other monoclonal antibodies==
Other biological therapy agents and monoclonal antibodies have not showed as much efficacy in the treatment of IBD.  These include [[etanercept]] (which is the soluble [[Receptor (immunology)|receptor]] for [[tumor necrosis factors|TNF]].<ref name=Etanercept><!--

[[certolizumab pegol|Certolizumab]] is a [[Antibody|Fab]] fragment of a humanized anti-[[TNF alpha]] [[monoclonal antibody]] that is attached to [[polyethylene glycol]] to increase its [[half-life]] in circulation.

==Side effects and concerns==
[[Image:Urticaria 2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Allergy|Allergic]] reactions can occur with [[infliximab]]]]
There have been concerns about the [[adverse effect|side effect]]s of monoclonal antibodies, and specifically of infliximab, but these are rare.  Early side effects include the risk of [[allergy|allergic]] reactions (including [[anaphylaxis]] which may be life-threatening), and reactions to the infusion.  These are often treated with medications given before treatment.  Infliximab also carries a risk of worsening infection, and can cause reactivation of old infections, like [[tuberculosis]].  Over time, there is the risk of [[serum sickness]], which is a delayed [[hypersensitivity]] response to the medication.  Later complications may include [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[lymphoma]].  Finally, the medication is quite expensive, with treatment costs ranging from US$3000 to $8000 per infusion.<!--

Loss of response to infliximab over time is a concern, due to the development of antibodies to infliximab (termed human anti-chimeric antibodies, or HACA).  This can be reduced by concurrent treatment with other immunosuppressant medications (including [[azathioprine]] and [[methotrexate]]), by maintaining a regular infusion schedule, and by giving patients a pre-treatment dose of steroid medication.<!--

==Helminthic Therapy==
[[Image:Trichuris egg.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Egg of ''Trichuris spp.'' [[whipworm]].

In helminth therapy (or worm therapy), a doctor inoculates a patient with a [[nematode]] worm that infects the intestinal tract. There are currently two closely related treatments available, inoculation with ''Necator americanus'', or [[hookworm]]s, or with ''Trichuris suis'' ova, (TSO), the eggs of the pig [[whipworm]]. 

Helminthic therapy emerged from the observation that people in less developed countries have more parasites and fewer autoimmune disorders and allergies. By comparison, highly industrialized countries with clean water and extensive sewage treatment systems (for example) have experienced a significant and sustained increase in autoimmune disorders.<ref name="pmid ">{{cite journal |author= P ZACCONE,* Z FEHERVARI,* J M PHILLIPS, D W DUNNE, and A COOKE |title= Parasitic worms and inflammatory diseases |journal= Parasite Immunol |volume= 28 |issue= 10|pages=515–523 | year=2006 |pmid= 16965287|pmc= 1618732 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-3024.2006.00879.x}}</ref><ref name="pmid 14684567">{{cite journal |author=Weinstock JV, Summers R, Elliott DE. |title= Helminths and harmony |journal=Gut |volume=53 |issue= 1|pages=7–9 |year=2004 |pmid= 14684567 |doi=10.1136/gut.53.1.7 |pmc=1773927}}</ref> Current research and available therapy is targeted at, or available for, the treatment of Crohn’s Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) as well as Multiple Sclerosis, Asthma, Eczema, Dermatitis, Hay fever and  food allergies.
