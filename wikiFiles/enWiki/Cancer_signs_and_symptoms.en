'''Cancer symptoms''' are changes in the body caused by the presence of [[cancer]]. They are usually caused by the effect of a [[cancer]] on the part of the body where it is growing, although the [[disease]] can cause more general symptoms such as [[weight loss]] or tiredness. It is advisable that anyone experiencing unusual symptoms that are not normal for them for more than a few weeks should seek medical attention.

There are more than 200 different types of [[cancer]] with a wide range of different signs and symptoms, making it difficult to produce a definitive list. For information about the specific signs and symptoms of a specific type of [[cancer]], please see the Wikipedia entry for that [[disease]].
