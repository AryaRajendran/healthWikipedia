'''Celadrin''' (cetylated fatty acids) is a proprietary blend of [[fatty acid ester|esterified fatty acids]] carbons and also the name of a [[topical analgesic]] drug that contains this cream and is used for [[osteoarthritis]]. The only [[active ingredient]] in this [[over-the-counter drug]] formulation is [[menthol]],<ref>[http://www.dailymedplus.com/monograph/view/setid/36e010ac-556f-487a-a246-a932d5b42636 Retrieved 2013-03-02 Prescribing monograph for Celadrin (menthol)]</ref> however celadrin is mentioned on a specific brand as [[active ingredient|functional ingredient]].<ref>http://www.nowfoods.com/Supplements/Products-by-Category/Joint-Pain-Mobility/Creams-Lotions/M045326.htm Retrieved 2013-04-08</ref> It is distributed by Imagenetix of San Diego, California.

==Published studies==

A human study showed that one week of treatment with a [[topical cream]] consisting of cetylated fatty acids (Celadrin) and menthol was similarly effective for reducing [[pain]] and improving functional performance in individuals with [[arthritis]] of the knee, elbow, and wrist; these data support the use of a topical cream consisting of [[cetylated fatty acids]] (with or without menthol) for enhancing the potential for exercise training in this population.<ref>{{cite journal

</ref> Another human study concluded that compared to [[placebo]], CFA (cetylated fatty acids; Celadrin) provides an improvement in knee range of motion and overall function in patients with [[osteoarthritis]] (OA) of the knee; thus CFA may be an alternative to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ([[NSAIDs]]) for the treatment of OA.<ref>{{cite journal

An ''[[in vitro]]'' study that investigated the effects of [[glucosamine]] (a dietary supplement used for knee osteoarthritis) and celadrin on [[platelet]] function concluded that glucosamine and celadrin may inhibit platelet aggregation in some individuals via [[aspirin]]-like effects as well as inhibition of [[ADP receptor]] P2Y1, but not P2Y12<ref>{{cite journal

==Interactions==
The [[antiplatelet]] effects of cealdrin (see above) mean that theoretically celadrin may interact with [[blood thinners]] (such as [[aspirin]], [[clopidogrel]] and [[warfarin]]), although this interaction has not been studied, and it is doubtful if this interaction occurs with the topical application of celadrin where the systemic absorbance is low.
