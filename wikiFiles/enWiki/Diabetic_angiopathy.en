'''Diabetic angiopathy''' is a form of [[angiopathy]] associated with [[diabetes mellitus]]. While not exclusive, the two most common forms are [[Diabetic retinopathy]] and [[Diabetic nephropathy]], whose pathophysiologies are largely identical. 

==Pathophysiology==
As insulin is required for glucose uptake,  hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus does not result in a net increase in intracellular glucose in most cells. However, chronic dysregulated blood glucose in diabetes is toxic to cells of the vascular endothelium which passively assimilate glucose.  That is, cells in which insulin is not required for intercellular transport of glucose, most-notably the [[pericytes]] of the [[microvasculature]]. In addition to direct glucose-induced damage by (e.g.) [[glycation]], pericytes express enzymes which convert glucose into osmologically-active metabolites such as [[sorbitol]] leading to hypertonic cell lysis.

Over time, pericyte death may result in reduced capillary integrity; subsequently, there is leaking of [[albumin]] and other proteins into fluid compartments. The glomeruli of the kidneys are especially sensitive - see [[diabetic nephropathy]] - where protein leakage caused by late-stage angiopathy results in diagnostic [[proteinuria]] and eventually [[renal failure]]. In diabetic retinopathy the end-result is often blindness due to irreversible retinal damage.

==Prognosis and complications==
Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of adult [[kidney failure]] worldwide. It also the most common cause of [[amputation]] in the US, usually toes and feet, often as a result of [[gangrene]], and almost always as a result of peripheral vascular disease. Retinal damage (from [[microangiopathy]]) makes it the most common cause of blindness among non-elderly adults in the US. 

Prognosis is generally poor for all forms of Diabetic angiopathy, as symptomatology is tied to the advancement of the underlying pathology i.e. the early-stage patient displays either [[non-specific symptom]]s or none at all. 

"Diabetic [[Diabetic dermopathy|dermopathy]]" is a manifestation of diabetic angiopathy. It is often found on the [[shinbone|shin]].

There is also [[Neuropathy]]; also associated with diabetes mellitus; type 1 and 2.
