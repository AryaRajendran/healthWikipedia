An '''abdominal x-ray''' is an [[Projectional radiography|x-ray]] of the [[abdomen]]. It is sometimes abbreviated to AXR, or [[kidneys, ureters, and bladder|KUB]] (for [[kidneys]], [[ureters]], and [[urinary bladder]]).

==Diagnostic Tool==

The abdominal x-ray is a test that can be carried out quickly and easily in an emergency department. The test can help diagnose some abdominal conditions. It is not a useful investigation for most abdominal conditions. Small and large bowel obstructions, volvulus and malrotations can be diagnosed by AXR. Renal, urethral and bladder stones can sometimes be identified on plain x-ray, although it is usual now to use CT as a first line investigation to confirm clinical suspicion. Gallstones are sometimes noted on x-ray, although ultrasound is the more usual imaging modality used when clinically suspected. Plain abdominal radiography is not usually helpful in diagnosis of appendicitis.

==Technical Parameters==

An abdominal x-ray is usually taken with the patient lying in a [[supine position]]. Other views include upright, decubitus, lateral, and prone. Coverage on the x-ray should include from the top of the Liver (or [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]) to the [[pubic symphysis]]. The abdominal organs included on the xray are the [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[stomach]], [[intestines]], [[pancreas]], [[kidneys]], and [[urinary bladder|bladder]].

==Pathology==

In an acute setting the abdominal x-ray is used to diagnose:

*[[Bowel obstruction]] with air fluid levels generally seen on X-ray.
*[[Bowel perforation]] although this is more commonly diagnosed by a [[Chest x-ray]]
*[[Kidney stones]] or [[Gall stones]] Further tests are used to confirm these diagnoses and abdominal x-ray is not the investigation of choice
*[[Faecal impaction]] although this should be diagnosed by history taking and clinical examination
