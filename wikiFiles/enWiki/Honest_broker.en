A '''honest broker''' is an entity which keeps sets of private information but distributes parts of those sets to other entities who should not have access to the entire set. Honest brokers often work in [[clinical research]] with [[biological specimens]]; in that case, donors of specimens allow researchers to do research on those specimens, but typically want their specimen [[de-identification|de-identified]] by having [[protected health information]] separated from it. The honest broker would keep both the specimen and associated protected health information, but only allow researchers to have access to the specimen without the protected health information.

==Characteristics ==
Honest brokers are typically appointed to a research project by an [[institutional review board]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1186/1472-6939-7-4}}</ref> They provide data from clinical and research sources for research use only and in accordance with policies which prohibit re-identification.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/cncr.23768}}</ref>

Organizations conducting [[breast cancer]] research have identified access to biological specimens as a top priority, and therefore honest broker systems are key to research because they increase access to specimens.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1046/j.1524-4741.1998.450391.x}}</ref>
