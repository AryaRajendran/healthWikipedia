==Life==
The son of John Hooper of [[Marylebone]], he was born in London. After a course of medical study in London he was appointed [[apothecary]] to the Marylebone [[workhouse]] infirmary. He entered [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], on 24 October 1796, graduated B.A. in 1803, M.A. and M.B. in 1804.

Settling in [[Savile Row]], Hooper lectured there on the practice of medicine. He made a study of [[pathology]], and formed a collection of illustrative specimens. He retired from practice in 1829, having made a fortune, and lived at [[Stanmore]].{{sfn|Bettany|1891}}

Hooper died in Bentinck Street, [[Manchester Square]], on 6 May 1835, in his sixty-third year.{{sfn|Bettany|1891}}

While still a practicing physician, he was an industrious writer. His books sold well, and revised editions remained in print to the end of the century. Hooper wrote:
