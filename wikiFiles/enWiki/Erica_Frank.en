==Professional experience==

Dr. Frank is Research Director of the Annenberg Physician Training Program (since 2005), served as a Senior Medical Scientist for the Occupational Health and Safety Agency for Healthcare of BC (2006-2007), and has travelled and/or worked in over 50 countries.  She founded the Ulrich and Ruth Frank Foundation for International Health in 1988, and has continuously served as its President.

Dr. Frank has extensive media experience. She was the health reporter from 1985-1987 for the [http://www.newscentralga.com/abc16 central Georgia ABC-TV affiliate], Editor of the student component of [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/journal.aspx JAMA]  in 1987-1988, the health reporter for [http://www.vogue.com.au/ Vogue] in 1988-1989, and Co-Editor in Chief of the scientific [http://www.journals.elsevier.com/preventive-medicine/ journal, Preventive Medicine] from 1994 to 1999.  She has also made multiple international television and radio appearances, written editorials, and been quoted in print as an expert on various prevention-related topics with [http://www.afp.com/en Agence France Presse], [http://www.ap.org/ Associated Press], [http://www.bbc.com/ BBC], [http://www.cbc.ca/ CBC], [[CNN]], Later [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]], [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]], [[New york times|New York Times]], [http://www.reuters.com/ Reuters], [http://www.usatoday.com/ USA Today], and others.

==NextGenU.org==
Dr. Frank’s most noteworthy accomplishment has been founding [https://www.nextgenu.org www.NextGenU.org], the world’s first portal to free, accredited, higher education. [[NextGenU]] has been called the world's first free university, as they are for credit, for free, unlike any other organization.   

NextGenU leads the next generation of [[MOOCs|Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)]].  While anyone anywhere can audit classes offered by NextGenU and other MOOCs for interest’s sake, NextGenU is the first site offering university, graduate-, and professional-level courses for credit, free of cost (as well as free of advertisements, geographical barriers, and carbon emissions). Founded in 2001, NextGenU began piloting courses in 2011, offered its first full course (Emergency Medicine for Senior Medical Students) in March 2012, and launched globally in April 2013.

Starting with a focus in the health and environmental sciences, NextGenU partners with leading accredited universities, professional societies, government agencies, and funders including [http://www.grandchallenges.ca/ Grand Challenges Canada], [http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/78209.htm NATO Science for Peace], the U.S. [http://www.cdc.gov/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] (CDC), and the [http://www.who.int/en/ World Health Organization]. All courses are competency-based and include knowledge transfer through already existing, online, expert-created and expert-selected learning resources, and guided opportunities to observe and practice skills with local mentorships and a web-based global peer community of practice.  NextGenU’s accredited partners give individual learners credit for this training (or institutions can adopt them and use them with their students). Because medical and public health schools typically allow students to receive credit for educational experiences offered away from their home institution, this makes NextGenU’s courses a familiar and credible model. 

To determine if there would be enough high-quality, free, and accredited learning resources to create a free university with NextGenU.org, Dr. Frank established [http://www.hso.info Health Sciences Online] (www.hso.info), the largest and most comprehensive ad-free health sciences information portal, and served as the Education Coordinator for the [http://www.who.int/en/ WHO InterNetwork] from 2002–2006.

==Research==
Dr. Frank has published over 140 peer-reviewed scientific publications, including four first-authored in JAMA and articles in other major peer-reviewed medical journals such as The Lancet, BMJ and Annals of Internal Medicine. 

In addition to Dr. Frank's research on the efficacy of NextGenU to improve health, her other research emphasis focuses on physicians’ personal and clinical prevention habits. This work has led to her developing the Healthy Doc - Healthy Patient initiative,  a series of studies and programs to improve physicians' prevention counseling by improving their personal health practices. Frank has done extensive research on the extent to which physicians' habits shape their patients' habits. 

This research began in 1991 with Frank’s conducting "The Women Physicians’ Health Study". WPHS demonstrated that physicians’ health practices strongly and consistently influence their patient care practices and that (contrary to myth) women physicians have extremely healthy personal practices.  Frank was also the Principal Investigator of a national study at 17 U.S. medical schools, showing that it is possible to cultivate personal health habits among medical students, and that these students are then more likely to counsel their patients about prevention. Her national studies in Canada, Colombia, and Israel (in a study of 1,488 physicians and their 1.9 million patients), have shown similar findings.

== Personal life ==
