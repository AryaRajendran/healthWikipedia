The '''menstrual cycle''' is the scientific term for the [[physiology|physiological]] changes that occur in fertile [[women]] and other female [[primates]] for the purposes of [[sexual reproduction]]. This article focuses on the human menstrual cycle, a "monthly" cycle that can vary around an average of ~28 days per cycle.  

The menstrual cycle, under the control of the [[endocrine system]], is necessary for [[reproduction]]. It is commonly divided into three phases: the [[follicular phase]], [[ovulation]], and the [[luteal phase]]. It is also occasionally misclassified using the uterine cycle: [[menstruation]], proliferative phase, and secretory phase.<ref>{{cite book|title=Exploring the dimensions of human sexuality|first=Jerrold S.|last=Greenberg|coauthors=Clint E. Bruess, Sarah C. Conklin|edition=3rd|year=2007|publisher=Jones & Bartlett|pages=136–137}}</ref> Menstrual cycles are counted from the first day of menstrual bleeding.

Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of [[estrogen]] in the follicular phase, discharges of blood (menses) slow then stop, and the [[Endometrium|lining]] of the [[uterus]] thickens. Follicles in the [[ovary]] begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles atrophy and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24–36 hours after the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[Ovum|ovum, or egg]] in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the egg only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the endometrium (uterine lining) changes to prepare for potential [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo to establish a [[pregnancy]]. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing sharp drops in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. These hormone drops cause the uterus to shed its lining and egg in a process termed menstruation.

In the menstrual cycle, changes occur in the [[female reproductive system]] as well as other systems (which lead to [[Mastodynia|breast tenderness]] or [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] changes, for example). A woman's first menstruation is termed [[menarche]], and occurs typically around age 12-13. The end of a woman's reproductive phase is called the [[menopause]], which commonly occurs somewhere between the ages of 45 and 55.

The length of a woman's menstrual cycle will typically vary, with some shorter cycles and some longer cycles. A woman who experiences variations of less than eight days between her longest cycles and shortest cycles is considered to have regular menstrual cycles. It is unusual for a woman to experience cycle length variations of less than four days. Length variation between eight and 20 days is considered as moderately [[irregular cycles]]. Variation of 21 days or more between a woman's shortest and longest cycle lengths is considered very irregular. <!--(see [[#Cycle abnormalities|cycle abnormalities]])--><ref name=kippley>{{cite book | first=John | last=Kippley | coauthors=Sheila Kippley | year=1996 | title=The Art of Natural Family Planning | edition=4th | publisher=The Couple to Couple League | location=Cincinnati, OH | isbn=0-926412-13-2 | page=92 }}</ref>

== Phases ==
The menstrual cycle can be divided into several different phases. The average length of each phase is shown below, the first three are related to changes in the lining of the uterus whereas the final three are related to processes occurring in the ovary:

=== Menstruation ===
{{main|Menstruation}}
Menstruation is also called '''menstrual bleeding''', '''menses''', '''catamenia''' or a '''period'''. The flow of menses normally serves as a sign that a woman has not become [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. (However, this cannot be taken as certainty, as a number of factors can cause [[Vaginal bleeding#Pregnant women|bleeding during pregnancy]]; some factors are specific to [[First trimester bleeding|early pregnancy]], and some can cause [[Obstetrical hemorrhage|heavy flow]].)<ref>{{cite web | last = Greenfield | first = Marjorie | title = Subchorionic Hematoma in Early Pregnancy | work = Ask Our Experts | publisher = DrSpock.com | date = 17 September 2001 | url = http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,8334,00.html | accessdate = 21 September 2008 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080915192741/http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,8334,00.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate = 15 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Anderson-Berry | first = Ann L | coauthors = Terence Zach | title = Vanishing Twin Syndrome | journal = Emedicine.com | publisher = WebMD | date = 10 December 2007 | url = http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC3411.HTM | accessdate = 21 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Ko | first = Patrick | coauthors = Young Yoon | title = Placenta Previa | journal = Emedicine.com | publisher = WebMD | date = 23 August 2007 | url = http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic427.htm | accessdate = 21 September 2008}}</ref>

Painful cramping in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs is common during the first few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as [[dysmenorrhea]], and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females).<ref>Sharma P., Malhotra C., Taneja D. K., Saha R. (2008). "Problems related to menstruation amongst adolescent girls". Indian J Pediatr 75 (2): 125–9. {{doi|10.1007/s12098-008-0018-5}}.

=== Follicular phase ===
{{main|Follicular phase}}
This phase is also called the ''proliferative phase'' because a hormone causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8">{{cite book

}}</ref>

Through the influence of a rise in [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few [[ovarian follicle]]s are stimulated.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/> These follicles, which were present at birth<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/> and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance. Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary, or Graafian, follicle, and it contains the ovum.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/>

As they mature, the follicles secrete increasing amounts of [[estradiol]], an [[estrogen]]. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of [[endometrium]] in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates [[Crypt (anatomy)|crypts]] in the [[cervix]] to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing [[fertility awareness]].<ref name=tcoyf2>{{cite book | first=Toni | last=Weschler | year=2002 | title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility | pages=359–361 | edition=Revised | publisher=HarperCollins | location=New York | isbn=0-06-093764-5 }}</ref>

=== Ovulation ===
{{main|Ovulation}}
[[File:ovulation.jpg|thumb|An ovary about to release an egg.]]

During the follicular phase, [[estradiol]] suppresses production of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) from the [[anterior pituitary gland]]. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of [[estradiol]] reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen actually stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day&nbsp;12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The exact mechanism of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol is not well understood.<ref name=Lentz>{{cite book|last=Lentz|first=Gretchen M|title=Comprehensive gynecology.|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=978-0-323-06986-1|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195&isbn=978-0-323-06986-1&sid=1291988935&uniqId=327920693-3#4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195|coauthors=Rogerio A.

The release of LH matures the egg and weakens the wall of the follicle in the ovary, causing the fully developed follicle to release its [[secondary oocyte]].<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/> The secondary oocyte promptly matures into an [[ootid]] and then becomes a mature [[ovum]].

After being released from the ovary, the egg is swept into the [[fallopian tube]] by the [[Fimbria (female reproductive system)|fimbria]], which is a fringe of tissue at the end of each fallopian tube. After about a day, an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in the fallopian tube.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/>

Fertilization by a [[spermatozoon]], when it occurs, usually takes place in the [[Ampulla of uterine tube|ampulla]], the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg immediately begins the process of [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/> It has usually reached the [[blastocyst]] stage at the time of implantation.

In some women, ovulation features a characteristic pain called ''[[mittelschmerz]]'' (German term meaning ''middle pain'').<ref name=allmenses/> The sudden change in hormones at the time of ovulation sometimes also causes light mid-cycle blood flow.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.65</ref>

=== Luteal phase ===
{{main|Luteal phase}}
The luteal phase is also called the ''secretory phase''. An important role is played by the [[corpus luteum]], the solid body formed in an ovary after the egg has been released from the ovary into the fallopian tube. This body continues to grow for some time after ovulation and produces significant amounts of hormones, particularly [[progesterone]].<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/> Progesterone plays a vital role in making the [[endometrium]] receptive to [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of the [[blastocyst]] and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the [[smooth muscle]] in the uterus;<ref>{{cite book|author=Lombardi, Julian|title=Comparative Vertebrate Reproduction|publisher=Springer|year=1998|isbn=9780792383369|page=184|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cqQX9RMPAegC&pg=PA184}}</ref> it also has the side effect of raising the woman's [[basal body temperature]].<ref name=tcoyf>Weschler (2002), pp.361-2</ref>

After ovulation, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/> Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.47</ref>

The loss of the corpus luteum can be prevented by fertilization of the egg; the resulting [[embryo]] produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which can preserve the corpus luteum. Because the hormone is unique to the embryo, most [[pregnancy test]]s look for the presence of hCG.<ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/>

=== Behavioral change ===
In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood swings can occur.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Peter J.|coauthors=Nieman, Lynnette K.; Danaceau, Merry A.; Adams, Linda F.; Rubinow, David R.|title=Differential Behavioral Effects of Gonadal Steroids in Women with and in Those without Premenstrual Syndrome|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=22 January 1998|volume=338|issue=4|pages=209–216|doi=10.1056/NEJM199801223380401}}</ref>

==Length==
Although many people believe the average menstrual cycle takes 28 days, a large study of more than 30,000 cycles from more than 2300 women showed that the mean cycle length was 29.1 with a [[standard deviation]] of 7.5 days and a 95% [[prediction interval]] of between 15 and 45 days.<ref name=Chiazze1968>{{cite pmid|5694118}} [http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/203/6/377.abstract]</ref> In that study, the subset of data with cycle lengths between 15 and 45 days had an average length of 28.1 days with a standard deviation of 4 days. A smaller study of 140 women performed in 2006 found a mean cycle length of 28.9 days.<ref>http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&context=nursing_fac</ref> 

The variability of menstrual cycle lengths is highest for women under 25 years of age and is lowest, that is, most regular, for ages 35 to 39.<ref name=Chiazze1968/> Subsequently, the variability increases slightly for women aged 40 to 44.<ref name=Chiazze1968/> Usually, length variation between eight and 20 days in a woman is considered as moderately [[irregular menstrual cycles]].<ref name=kippley/> Variation of 21 days or more is considered very irregular.<ref name="kippley"/>

As measured on women undergoing [[in vitro fertilization]], a longer menstrual cycle length is associated with higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment.<ref name="Brodin2008">{{cite pmid|18155201}}</ref> [[Delivery rate]]s after IVF has been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days.<ref name="Brodin2008"/> A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to [[gonadotropin]] stimulation and [[embryo quality]].<ref name="Brodin2008"/>

The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is about the same length in most individuals (mean 14/13 days, SD 1.41 days)<ref name=Lenton_luteal>{{cite journal|last=Lenton|first=EA|coauthors=Landgren, BM; Sexton, L|title=Normal variation in the length of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle: identification of the short luteal phase.|journal=British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology|date=1984 Jul|volume=91|issue=7|pages=685–9|pmid=6743610}}</ref> whereas the follicular phase tends to show much more variability (log-normally distributed with 95% of individuals having follicular phases between 10.3 and 16.3 days).<ref name=Lenton_follicular>{{cite journal|last=Lenton|first=EA|coauthors=Landgren, BM; Sexton, L; Harper, R|title=Normal variation in the length of the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle: effect of chronological age.|journal=British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology|date=1984 Jul|volume=91|issue=7|pages=681–4|pmid=6743609}}</ref> The follicular phase also seems to get significantly shorter with age (geometric mean 14.2 days in women age 18-24 vs. 10.4 days in women aged 40–44).<ref name=Lenton_follicular />

A 1979 study of 305 women found that approximately one-third of the subjects had lunar period cycles in length, i.e.,&nbsp;a mean cycle length of 29.5 days plus or minus 1 day. Almost two-thirds of the subjects started their cycle in the brighter half of the lunar cycle, significantly more than would be expected by random distribution.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=7246643|year=1981|last1=Friedmann|first1=E|title=Menstrual and lunar cycles|volume=140|issue=3|page=350|jgmailaournal=American journal of obstetrics and gynecology}}</ref> Another study found a statistically significant number of menstruations occurred around the new moon.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/00016348609158228 | pmid=3716780 |title=The Regulation of Menstrual Cycle and its Relationship to the Moon |year=1986 |last1=Law |first1=Sung Ping |journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica |volume=65 |pages=45–8 |issue=1}}</ref>

== Fertile window ==
{{main|Fertility testing}}
The most fertile period (the time with the highest likelihood of pregnancy resulting from [[sexual intercourse]]) covers the time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation.<ref>Weschler (2002), pp.242,374</ref> In a 28‑day cycle with a 14‑day luteal phase, this corresponds to the second and the beginning of the third week.

Mice have been used as an experimental system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of [[sex steroid]] hormones might regulate [[nervous system]] function. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when progesterone is highest, the level of [[Neuron|nerve-cell]] [[GABA A receptor|GABA receptor]] subtype delta was high. Since these GABA receptors are [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]], nerve cells with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels, the number of delta receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.<ref name=Maguire>{{cite journal |author=Maguire J.

Among women living closely together, it was once thought that the onsets of menstruation tend to [[Menstrual synchrony|synchronize]].

==Cycle abnormalities and disorders== <!-- [[Irregular]] refers to here -->
{{main|Menstrual disorder}}
Infrequent or irregular ovulation is called ''oligoovulation''.<ref>{{cite web | last = Galan | first = Nicole | title = Oligoovulation | publisher = about.com | date = 16 April 2008 | url = http://pcos.about.com/od/glossary/g/oligoovulation.htm | accessdate = 12 October 2008}}</ref> The absence of ovulation is called ''[[anovulation]]''. Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an [[anovulatory cycle]]. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will form and will stimulate the uterine lining. Anovulatory flow resulting from a very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called ''estrogen breakthrough bleeding''. Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called changes.<ref name=tcoyf3>Weschler (2002), p.107</ref> Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before [[menopause]] (perimenopause) and in women with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]].<ref name=emed2>{{EMedicine|med|146|Anovulation}}</ref>

Very little flow (less than 10 ml) is called ''[[hypomenorrhea]]''. Regular cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer are ''[[polymenorrhea]]''; frequent but irregular menstruation is known as ''[[metrorrhagia]]''. Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed ''[[menorrhagia]]''.<ref name=emed1>{{EMedicine|ped|2781|Menstruation Disorders}}</ref> Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is ''[[menometrorrhagia]]''.

George Preti, an organic chemist at the [[Monell Chemical Senses Center]] in [[Philadelphia]] and Winnefred Cutler of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s psychology department, discovered that women with irregular menstrual cycles became regular when exposed to male underarm extracts.<ref name=Boston>[http://www.boston.com/yourlife/relationships/articles/2003/09/02/looking_for_love_potion_number_nine/ Looking for love potion number nine], Cathryn M.

== Ovulation suppression ==

=== Hormonal contraception ===
{{main|Hormonal contraception}}
[[File:pillpacketopen.jpg|thumb|right|Half-used blister pack of a combined oral contraceptive. The white pills are [[placebos]], mainly for the purpose of reminding the woman to continue taking the pills.]]
While some forms of [[birth control]] do not affect the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen [[negative feedback]] decreases the pulse frequency of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) release by the [[hypothalamus]], which decreases the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) by the [[anterior pituitary]]. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.<ref name=hatcher>{{cite book |author=Trussell, James |year=2007 |chapter=Contraceptive Efficacy |editor=Hatcher, Robert A., et al. |title=Contraceptive Technology |edition=19th rev. |pages= |location=New York |publisher=Ardent Media |isbn=0-9664902-0-7 |chapterurl=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html}}</ref><ref name=speroff>{{cite book |author=Speroff, Leon; Darney, Philip D. |year=2005 |chapter=Oral Contraception |title=A Clinical Guide for Contraception |edition=4th |pages=21–138 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |isbn=0-7817-6488-2}}</ref><ref name=loose>{{cite book |author=Loose, Davis S.; Stancel, George M. |editor=Brunton, Laurence L.; Lazo, John S.; Parker, Keith L.

The degree of ovulation suppression in progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the [[progestogen]] activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives—traditional [[progestogen only pill]]s, [[subdermal implant]]s [[Norplant]] and Jadelle, and [[IntraUterine System|intrauterine system]] Mirena—inhibit ovulation in about 50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as thickening of cervical mucus, for their contraceptive effectiveness.<ref name=glasier>{{cite book |last=[[Anna Glasier|Glasier]] |first=Anna |editor=DeGroot, Leslie J.; Jameson, J.

The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables [[Depo-Provera]] and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.<ref name=glasier/>

Combined hormonal contraceptives include both an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of LH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular [[breakthrough bleeding]].<ref name=hatcher/><ref name=speroff/><ref name=loose/> Several combined hormonal contraceptives—[[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], [[NuvaRing]], and the [[contraceptive patch]]—are usually used in a way that causes regular [[withdrawal bleeding]]. In a normal cycle, [[menstruation]] occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly.<ref name=tcoyf/> Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be [[extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptive|taken continuously]], although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.

=== Lactational amenorrhea ===
{{main|Lactational amenorrhea method}}
[[Breastfeeding]] causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending on the strength of the negative feedback, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, follicular development but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycles may resume.<ref name=mcneilly>{{cite journal |author=McNeilly AS |title=Lactational control of reproduction |journal=Reprod.
