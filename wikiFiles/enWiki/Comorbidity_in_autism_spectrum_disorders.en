[[Autism spectrum]] disorders tend to be highly comorbid with other disorders. [[Comorbidity]] may increase with age and may worsen the course of youth with ASDs and make intervention/treatment more difficult.<ref name="Joshi et al.">{{cite journal|last=Joshi|coauthors=Petty, Wozniak, Henin, Fried, Galdo, Kotarski, Walls, & Bierderman|title=The heavy burden of psychiatric comorbidity in youth with autism spectrum disorders: A large comparative study of a psychiatrically referred population|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=2010|volume=40|pages=1361–1370|doi=10.1007/s10803-010-0996-9|pmid=20309621|first1=G|issue=11}}</ref> Distinguishing between ASDs and other diagnoses can be challenging because the traits of ASDs often overlap with symptoms of other disorders and the characteristics of ASDs make traditional diagnostic procedures difficult.<ref name="Helverschou et al.">{{cite book|last=Matson & Sturmey|title=International Handbook of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders|year=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=53–74}}</ref><ref>Underwood, L., McCarthy, J. & Tsakanikos, E. (2010). Mental health in adults with autism and intellectual disabilities. Current Opinion in Psychiatry, 23, 421–426. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20613532]</ref> In spite of these difficulties, comorbid disorders are readily identified and tend to fall into six categories: medical conditions, intellectual disabilities, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, behavior-related disorders, and sensory processing disorders.

== Medical conditions ==


A variety of medical conditions commonly occur in individuals with ASDs. The most common is seizure disorder or [[epilepsy]], which occurs in 11-39% of individuals with ASD.<ref name="Ballaban-Gill & Tuchman">{{cite journal|last=Ballaban-Gil|coauthors=Tuchman|title=Epilepsy and epileptiform EEG: Association with autism and language disorders|journal=Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews|year=2000|volume=6|issue=4|pages=300–308|doi=10.1002/1098-2779(2000)6:4<300::AID-MRDD9>3.0.CO;2-R|pmid=11107195|first1=K}}</ref> Typically, onset of epilepsy occurs before age five or during puberty.<ref name=Canitano>{{cite journal|last=Canitano|first=R|title=Epilepsy in autism spectrum disorders|journal=European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry|year=2007|volume=16|issue=1|pages=61–66|doi=10.1007/s00787-006-0563-2}}</ref> and is more common in females and individuals who also have a comorbid [[intellectual disability]]. Tic disorder is another common medical condition seen in individuals with ASDs. While only about 6.5% of individuals with an ASD have full blown [[Tourette syndrome]], nearly 30% show some form of tics.<ref name="Baron-Cohen et al.">{{cite journal|last=Baron-Cohen|coauthors=Scahill, Izaguirre, Hornsey, & Robertson|title=The prevalence of Gilles de le Tourette syndrome in children and adolescents with autism: A large scale study|journal=Psychological Medicine|year=1999|volume=29|pages=1151–1159|doi=10.1017/S003329179900896X|pmid=10576307|first1=S|issue=5}}</ref> [[Tuberous sclerosis]], a medical condition in which non-malignant tumors grow in the brain and on other vital organs, occurs in 1-4% of individuals with ASDs.<ref name=Wiznitzer>{{cite journal|last=Wiznitzer|first=M|title=Autism and tuberous sclerosis|journal=Journal of Child Neurology|year=2004|volume=19|issue=9|pages=675–679|pmid=15563013}}</ref> Sleep disorders are also commonly reported by parents of children with ASDs, including late sleep onset, early morning awakening, and poor sleep maintenance.<ref name=Canitano />

== Intellectual disabilities ==


Intellectual disabilities are some of the most common comorbid disorders with ASDs. Recent estimates suggest that 40-69% of individuals with ASD have some degree of [[mental retardation]],<ref name="Mash & Barkley">{{cite book|last=Mash & Barkley|title=Child Psychopathology|year=2003|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York|pages=409–454}}</ref>  with females more likely to be in severe range of mental retardation. [[Learning disabilities]] are also highly comorbid in individuals with an ASD. Approximately 25-75% of individuals with an ASD also have some degree of learning disability,<ref name="Obrien & Pearson">{{cite journal |last=O'Brien |coauthors=Pearson |title=Autism and learning disability |journal=Autism |year=2004 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=125–140 |doi=10.1177/1362361304042718 |pmid=15165430 |first1=G}}</ref> although the types of learning disability vary depending on the specific strengths and weaknesses of the individual.

== Anxiety disorders ==


A variety of [[anxiety disorders]] tend to co-occur with autism spectrum disorders, with overall comorbidity rates of 7-84%.<ref name="Mash & Barkley" /> [[Specific phobia]] is the most common comorbid condition over the lifetime for those with ASD, with comorbidity rates of 38-63%.<ref name="Joshi et al." /> Common phobias for children with ASD include the fear of certain places or situations, the fear of medically related people, places, or things, and the fear of loud noises.<ref name="Leyfer et al.">{{cite journal|last=Leyfer|coauthors=Folstein, Bacalman, Davis, Dinh, Morgan, & Lainhart|title=Comorbid psychiatric disorders in children with autism: Interview development and rates of disorders|journal=Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders|year=2006|volume=36|issue=7|pages=849–861|doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0123-0|first1=Ovsanna T.}}</ref> [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) occurs in 11-35% of individuals with ASD, with 16-81% showing features of the disorder without a full diagnosis. While individuals with ASD exhibit rigid thinking and compulsions, similar to OCD, the repetitive behaviors displayed in ASD (i.e., flapping, spinning, repeating phrases) are distinct and serve alternate functions than the repetitive behaviors displayed in OCD (i.e., checking, cleaning, counting).<ref name="Joshi et al." /> Social Phobia or [[Social Anxiety Disorder]] is seen in approximately 7.4% of individuals with ASD, but is more common in higher-functioning individuals who have a desire for social interactions, but are also aware of their social deficits.<ref name="Joshi et al." />

== Mood disorders ==


Rates of comorbid [[Depression (mood)|depression]] in individuals with an ASD range from 4&ndash;58%.<ref name=Lainhart>{{cite journal|last=Lainhart|first=J|title=Psychiatric problems in individuals with autism, their parents and siblings|journal=International Review of Psychiatry|year=1999|volume=11|pages=278–298|doi=10.1080/09540269974177|issue=4}}</ref> The presentation of depression in ASDs can depend on level of cognitive functioning, with lower functioning children displaying more behavior issues and higher functioning children displaying more traditional depressive symptoms.<ref name="Helverschou et al." /> Depression is thought to develop and occur more in high-functioning individuals during adolescence, when they develop greater insight into their differences from others.<ref name="Mash & Barkley" /> [[Bipolar disorder]] may also be comorbid with an ASD, although it is far less common than many other disorders. Rates of comorbidity vary greatly, but tend to be around 2-8%.<ref name="Leyfer et al." />

== Behavior-related disorders ==


Deficits in ASD are often linked to behavior problems, such as difficulties following directions, being cooperative, and doing things on other people's terms <ref>Tsakanikos, E., Costello, H., Holt, G., Sturmey, P., Bouras, N. (2007). Behaviour management problems as predictors of psychotropic medication and use of psychiatric services in adults with autism. ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders'', '''35''': 1080-1085. [http://cogprints.org/6268/2/JADD_2007.pdf]</ref> These behavior problems are also characteristic of [[Oppositional Defiant Disorder]] (ODD) and
[[Conduct Disorder]] (CD), but the reasons for the behaviors often differ.<ref name="Leyfer et al." /> For this reason, comorbidity rates of ODD and CD range from 7%<ref name="Leyfer et al." /> to 73%.<ref name="Joshi et al." /> [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]] (ADHD) has ASD comorbidity rates of 30-80%; however, current diagnostic guidelines prevent diagnosing ADHD along with ASD.<ref name="Leyfer et al." /> Rather, ADHD-like symptoms are seen to be part of the ASD diagnosis.<ref name="Rommelse et al.">{{cite journal|last=Rommelse|coauthors=Franke, Geurts, Hartman, & Buitelaar|title=Shared heritability of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder|journal=European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|year=2010|volume=19|pages=281–295|doi=10.1007/s00787-010-0092-x|pmid=20148275|first1=NN|issue=3|pmc=2839489}}</ref>

== Sensory processing disorders ==


[[Sensory processing disorder]] is also comorbid with ASD, with comorbidity rates of 42-88%.<ref name="Baranek 2002">{{cite journal|last=Baranek|first=G|title=Efficacy of sensory and motor interventions in children with autism|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=2002|volume=32|issue=5|pages=397–422|doi=10.1023/A:1020541906063|pmid=12463517}}</ref> Three patterns of sensory processing difficulties are commonly seen, hyperresponsiveness (behavioral over-reactivity to sensory stimuli), hyporesponsiveness (behavioral under-reactivity to sensory stimuli), and sensory-seeking (craving or fascination with certain stimuli). These patterns of processing difficulties may be present with auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli.<ref name="Boyd et al.">{{cite journal|last=Boyd|coauthors=Baranek, Sideris, Poe, Watson, Patten, & Miller|title=Sensory features and repetitive behaviors in children with autism and developmental delays|journal=Autism Research|year=2010|volume=3|issue=2|pages=78–87|pmid=20437603|first1=BA|doi=10.1002/aur.124|pmc=3071028}}</ref>
