'''Lithotomy''' from [[Greek language|Greek]] for "lithos" (stone) and "tomos" (cut), is a [[surgery|surgical]] method for removal of [[calculus (medicine)|calculi]], stones formed inside certain hollow organs, such as the [[kidney]]s ([[kidney stone]]s), [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] ([[bladder stone]]s), and [[gallbladder]] ([[gallstone]]s), that cannot exit naturally through the [[urinary system]] or [[biliary tract]]. The procedure, which is usually performed by means of a surgical incision (therefore [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive]]), differs from [[lithotripsy]], wherein the stones are crushed either by a [[Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures#Minimally_invasive_procedure|minimally invasive]] probe inserted through the exit canal, or by an acoustic pulse ([[extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy]]), which is a [[Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures#Non-invasive_procedure|non-invasive]] procedure.

==History==
Human beings have known of bladder stones ("vesical calculi") for thousands of years, and have attempted to treat them for almost as long. The oldest bladder stone that has been found was discovered in Egypt around 1900, and it has been dated to 4900 [[Common Era|BC]]. The earliest written records describing bladder stones date to before the time of [[Hippocrates]] (ca. 460-370 BC). However, lithotomy was a fairly common procedure in the past, and there were specialized lithotomists. The ancient Greek [[Hippocratic Oath]] includes the phrase: "I will not cut for stone, even for the patients in whom the disease is manifest; I will leave this operation to be performed by practitioners," a clear warning for physicians against the "cutting" of persons "laboring under the stone"; an act that was better left to ''surgeons'' (who were distinct from ''physicians'' at that time in history). Operations to remove bladder stones via the [[perineum]], like other surgery before the invention of anesthesia, were intensely painful for the patient.<ref name="al-ZahrāwīStudies1973">{{cite book|last1=al-Zahrāwī|first1=Abū al-Qāsim Khalaf ibn ʻAbbās|last2=Studies|first2=Gustave E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern|title=Albucasis on surgery and instruments|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mjVra87nRScC&pg=PR8|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01532-6|pages=410–6}}</ref>

[[Ammonius Lithotomos|Ammonius]], who practiced lithotomy in [[Alexandria]] circa 200 BC, acquired the surname Lithotomus from the instrument he developed for fragmenting stones too large to pass through a small perineal incision.<ref name=Collier1831>{{cite book|author=Aulus Cornelius Celsus|authorlink=Aulus Cornelius Celsus|editor-last=Collier|editor-first=GF|title=A translation of the eight books of Aul.

[[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] (1st century), and the Hindu surgeon [[Susruta]] produced early descriptions of bladder stone treatment using perineal lithotomy. [[Paulus Aegineta]] 7th-century Byzantine Greek physician his ''Medical Compendium in Seven Books''. This work contained a summary of medical knowledge and was unrivaled in its accuracy and completeness. Paulus' description of lithotomy closely follows that of Celsus. 

[[Albucasis]] follows Paulus almost word for word but then describes a different sort of knife one that is "sharp on two sides" (Spinks and Lewis say it's difficult to reconcile the drawing of the knife to the procedure)<ref name="al-ZahrāwīStudies1973" /> Albucasis also adds using forceps instead of the scoop and chisel of Ammonius to break up the stone. Albucasis also uses a "drill" for stones impacted in the urethra, a technique not recorded earlier.<ref name="al-ZahrāwīStudies1973"/> 

In the 16th century, [[Pierre Franco]] (1505–1578) was a pioneer in the suprapubic lithotomy method.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Androutsos G|title=[Pierre Franco (1505-1578): famous surgeon and lithotomist of the 16th century]|language=French|journal=Prog Urol|volume=14|issue=2|pages=255–9|year=2004|pmid=15217153}}</ref> [[Frère Jacques Beaulieu]] (also known as Frère Jacques Baulot<ref>[http://beaufort39.free.fr/baulot.htm baulot Frère Jacques Baulot]</ref><ref>''Un célèbre lithotomiste franc-comtois: Jacques Baulot dit Frère Jacques (1651-1720)'', E. Bourdin, Besançon, 1917</ref>) developed an operation that went in laterally to remove the bladder stones in the late 16th century. Beaulieu was a travelling lithotomist and a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friar, with scant knowledge of anatomy. Beaulieu performed the frequently deadly procedure in France into the late 16th century. A possible connection between the French nursery rhyme ''[[Frère Jacques]]'' and Frère Jacques Beaulieu, as claimed by Irvine Loudon<ref>{{Cite book|author=Loudon, Irvine|title=Western medicine: an illustrated history|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2001|isbn=0-19-924813-3 }}</ref> and many others, was recently explored without finding any evidence for a connection.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ganem JP, Carson CC|title=Frère Jacques Beaulieu: from rogue lithotomist to nursery rhyme character|journal=J Urol|volume=161|issue=4|pages=1067–9|year=1999|pmid=10081839|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5347(01)61591-X|doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(01)61591-X}}</ref> Some have suggested that ''Frère Jacques'' was instead written to mock the [[Dominican Order|Jacobin]] monks of France.<ref>{{EMedicine|med|2852|Bladder Stones}}</ref>

Lithotomy was successfully performed by some practitioners in the 17th century, for example [[Johann Andreas Eisenbarth]] (1663–1727). Other important names in its historical development were [[Jean Zuléma Amussat]] (1796–1856), [[Auguste Nélaton]] (1807–1873), [[Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet|Henry Thompson]](1820–1904) and [[William Cheselden]] (1688–1752). The latter invented a technique for lateral vesical stone lithotomy in 1727, whereupon he was said to perform the operation in about one minute (an important feat before [[anesthesia]]). French composer [[Marin Marais]] wrote ''"Tableau de l'opération de la taille''" ("tableau of a Lithotomy") a musical description of the operation, in 1725.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Evers S|title=[Tableau de l'opération de la taille by Marin Marais (1725)—a bladder calculus operation represented in music]|language=German|journal=Urologe A|volume=32|issue=3|pages=254–9|year=1993|pmid=8511837}}</ref>

In England, [[William Thornhill]] performed his first suprapubic operation on a boy privately on 3 Feb. 1722-3.<ref>http://www.thefullwiki.org/Page:Dictionary_of_National_Biography_volume_56.djvu/303</ref> The records of his work, published by his colleague, John Middleton, M.D., prove that his experience in the operation and his success were greater than any contemporary English surgeon could show. 

Special [[surgical instruments]] were designed for lithotomy, consisting of [[dilator]]s of the canal, [[forceps]] and [[tweezer]]s, lithotomes (stone cutter) and cystotomes (bladder cutter), urethrotomes (for incisions of the urethra) and conductors, (grooved probes used as guides for stone extraction). The patient is placed in a special position in a lithotomy [[operating table]], called the [[lithotomy position]] (which, curiously, retains this name until present for other unrelated medical procedures).

Transurethral [[lithotripsy]], which was much simpler and with lower [[morbidity]], [[complication (medicine)|complication]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] rates, was invented by [[France|French]] [[surgery|surgeon]] [[Jean Civiale]] (1792–1867) and largely substituted for surgical lithotomy, unless the crushing of calculi was difficult or impossible.
