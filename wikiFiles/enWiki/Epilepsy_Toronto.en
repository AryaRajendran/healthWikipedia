'''Epilepsy Toronto''' is a [[non-profit]] organization that has been supporting people living with [[epilepsy]] for the last 50 years. In 1956, a small group of parents with a steadfast belief in their childrenâ€™s rights founded the group. Today the organization prioritizes community engagement and individual focus.  Epilepsy Toronto serves families within the GTA with a range of tailored programs that support people living with epilepsy to live independent lives and education for family members about the effects of epilepsy. Through Epilepsy Toronto's programs, individuals have the opportunity to meet others who have the same condition and to increase awareness in the broader community.  The organization's philosophy is one of inclusion and empowerment and its goal is to have members feel connected whether they are in need of services themselves or are in a position to support others.
