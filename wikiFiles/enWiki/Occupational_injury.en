An '''occupational injury''' is  bodily damage resulting from working.

In the United States in 2007, 5,488 workers died from job injuries, 92% of which were men,<ref>US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The most usual [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s involved are the [[vertebral column|spine]], [[hand]]s, the [[Human head|head]], [[human lung|lung]]s, [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human skeleton|skeleton]], and [[human skin|skin]]. According to data from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], an average of 15 workers die from traumatic injuries each day in the United States, and  an additional 200 workers are hospitalized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/injury/|title=Traumatic Occupational Injuries|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=29 May 2009}}</ref>

Common causes of industrial injury are poor [[ergonomics]], [[manual handling]] of heavy loads, misuse or failure of equipment, exposure to general hazards, inadequate safety training and [[clothing]], [[jewellery]] or long [[hair]] that becomes tangled in machinery.

General hazards in a work environment include [[electricity]], [[explosive]] materials, [[fire]], [[flammable]] gases, [[heat]], [[height]], high [[pressure]] gases and liquids, hot gases and liquids, powerful or sharp moving [[machinery]], [[oxygen]]-free gases or spaces, [[poison]]ous [[gas]]es, [[radiation]], [[toxic]] materials, work on, near or under [[water]], work on, near or under weak or heavy structures.

There are many methods of preventing or reducing industrial injuries, including anticipation of problems by [[risk assessment]], safety training, [[control banding]], [[personal protective equipment]] safety guards, mechanisms on machinery, and safety barriers. In addition, past problems can be analyzed to find their [[root cause]]s by using a technique called [[root cause analysis]].
