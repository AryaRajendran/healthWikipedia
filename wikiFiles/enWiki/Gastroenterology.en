'''Gastroenterology''' ([[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] heading)<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2007/MB_cgi?mode=&term=gastroenterology nlm.nih.gov]</ref> is a branch of [[medicine]] focused on the [[digestive system]] and its disorders. The name is a combination of three [[Ancient Greek]] words ''[[wikt:γαστήρ|gaster]] (gen.: gastros)'' ([[stomach]]), ''[[wikt:ἔντερον|enteron]]'' ([[intestine]]), and ''[[logos]]'' ([[reason]]).  In the United States, Gastroenterology is an Internal Medicine Subspecialty certified by the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] (ABIM) and the [[American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine]] (AOBIM).

[[Diseases]] affecting the [[gastrointestinal tract]], which includes the [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] from [[human mouth|mouth]] to [[anus]], along the [[alimentary canal]], are the focus of this specialty. [[Physician]]s practicing in this field of medicine are called '''gastroenterologists'''. They have usually completed the eight years of pre-medical and medical education, the year-long internship (if this is not a part of the residency), three years of an internal medicine residency, and two to three years in the gastroenterology fellowship. Some gastroenterology trainees will complete a "fourth-year" (although this is often their 7th year of graduate medical education) in Transplant [[Hepatology]], Advanced [[Endoscopy]], [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease]] (IBD), motility or other topics. 

Gastroenterology is not the same as colorectal or hepatobiliary surgery, which are specialty branches of general surgery. 

'''[[Hepatology]]''', or '''hepatobiliary medicine''', encompasses the study of the [[liver]], [[pancreas]], and [[biliary tree]], and is traditionally considered a sub-specialty.

==History==

[[File:Bozzini Lichtleiter.jpg|thumb|Drawings of Bozzini's "Lichtleiter"]]

Citing from [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[papyrus|papyri]], Nunn identified significant knowledge of gastrointestinal diseases among practising physicians during the periods of the [[pharaoh]]s. [[Irynakhty]], of the tenth dynasty, c. 2125 B.C., was a court [[physician]] specialising in gastroenterology, sleeping, and [[proctology]].<ref>Nunn JF. Ancient Egyptian Medicine. 2002. ISBN 0-8061-3504-2.</ref>

Among ancient [[Greeks]], [[Hippocrates]] attributed [[digestion]] to concoction. [[Galen]]'s concept of the [[stomach]] having four ''faculties'' was widely accepted up to modernity in the seventeenth century.

Eighteenth century:
* [[Italy|Italian]] [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] (1729–99) was among early [[physician]]s to disregard Galen's theories, and in 1780 he gave experimental proof on the action of [[gastric juice]] on foodstuffs.
* In 1767, [[Germany|German]] [[Johann Georg Ritter von Zimmermann|Johann von Zimmermann]] wrote an important work on [[dysentery]].
* In 1777, [[Maximilian Stoll]] of [[Vienna]] described cancer of the [[gallbladder]].<ref>Edgardo Rivera, MD

Nineteenth century:
* In 1805, [[Philipp Bozzini]] made the first attempt to observe inside the living human body using a tube he named ''Lichtleiter'' (light-guiding instrument) to examine the [[urinary tract]], the [[rectum]], and the [[human pharynx|pharynx]]. This is the earliest description of [[endoscopy]].<ref>Gilger, Mark A. MD,Gastroenterologic endoscopy in children: past, present, and future. Gastroenterology and nutrition Current Opinion in Pediatrics. 13(5):429-434, October 2001.

* [[Charles Emile Troisier]] described enlargement of [[lymph node]]s in abdominal cancer.<ref>Anton Sebastian,A Dictionary of the History of Medicine, ISBN 1-85070-021-4</ref>
* In 1823, [[William Prout]] discovered that [[stomach]] juices contain [[hydrochloric acid]].<ref>''Prout, W.'' On the nature of the acid and saline matters usually existing in the stomachs of animals.&nbsp;– Philos. Transactions, 1824, 1, 45.</ref>
* In 1868, [[Adolf Kussmaul]], a well-known German physician, developed the [[gastroscope]]. He perfected the technique on a [[Sword swallowing|sword swallower]].
* In 1871, at the society of physicians in Vienna, [[Karl Stoerk|Carl Stoerk]] demonstrated an esophagoscope made of two telescopic metal tubes, initially devised by Waldenburg in 1870.
* In 1876, [[Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer]] described the properties of some liver cells now called [[Kupffer cell]].
* In 1883, [[Hugo Kronecker]] and [[Samuel James Meltzer]] studied oesophageal [[manometry]] in humans.

Twentieth century:
* In 1915, [[Jesse Francis McClendon|Jesse McClendon]] tested [[Gastric acid|acidity]] of human stomach ''[[in situ]]''.<ref>McClendon J. F. New hydrogen electrodes and rapid methods of determining hydrogen ion concentrations.&nbsp;– Amer. J. Physoil., 1915, 38, 2, 180.</ref>
* In 1921-22, [[Walter C. Alvarez|Walter Alvarez]] did the first [[electrogastrogram|electrogastrography]] research.<ref>Alvarez W. C. The electrogastrogram and what it shows. JAMA, 78(15):1116-18, 1922.</ref>
* [[Rudolph Schindler (doctor)|Rudolph Schindler]] described many important diseases involving the human digestive system during [[World War I]] in his illustrated textbook and is portrayed by some as the "father of gastroscopy". He and [[Georg Wolf]] developed a semiflexible gastroscope in 1932.
* In 1932, [[Burrill Bernard Crohn]] described [[Crohn's disease]].
* In 1957, [[Basil Hirschowitz]] introduced the first prototype of a fibreoptic gastroscope.

Twenty-first century:
* In 2005, [[Barry Marshall]] and [[Robin Warren]] of Australia were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their discovery of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' (1982/1983) and its role in [[peptic ulcer disease]].  James Leavitt assisted in their research, but the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously so he was not included in the award.
