'''[[Gustav III of Sweden]]'s coffee experiment''' was a [[twin study]] ordered by the king to study the [[health effects of coffee]]. Although the authenticity of the event has been questioned,<ref name="Linné" /> the experiment, which was conducted in the second half of the 18th century, failed to prove that [[coffee]] was a dangerous beverage.

==Background==
Coffee first arrived in [[Sweden]] around 1674,<ref name="Linné" /> but was little used until the turn of 18th century when it became fashionable among the wealthy.<ref name="WeinbergBealer2001" /><ref name="NyTeknik">{{cite web |url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/it_telekom/allmant/article247458.ece |title=Gustav IIIs odödliga kaffeexperiment |trans_title=Gustav III's immortal coffee experiment |last=Sempler |first=Kaianders |date=15 March 2006  |publisher=''[[Ny Teknik]]'' |accessdate=6 February 2012 |language=Swedish}}</ref> In 1746, a royal [[edict]] was issued against coffee and [[tea]] due to "the misuse and excesses of tea and coffee drinking".<ref name="WeinbergBealer2001">{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Bennett Alan|last2=Bealer|first2=Bonnie K.|title=The world of caffeine: the science and culture of the world's most popular drug|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YdpL2YCGLVYC&pg=PA92|accessdate=9 February 2012|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-92722-2|pages=92–3}}</ref> Heavy taxes were levied on consumption, and failure to pay the tax on the substance resulted in fines and confiscation of cups and dishes.<ref name="WeinbergBealer2001" /> Later, coffee was banned completely; despite the ban, consumption continued.<ref name="WeinbergBealer2001" />

Gustav III, who viewed coffee consumption as a threat to the [[public health]] and was determined to prove its negative health effects, ordered a scientific experiment to be carried out.<ref name="NyTeknik" />

==The experiment==
The king ordered the experiment to be conducted using two [[identical twins]]. Both of the twins had been tried for the crimes they had committed and [[Capital punishment|condemned to death]]. Their sentences were commuted to [[life imprisonment]] on the condition that one of the twins drank three pots<ref name="Linné" /> of coffee, and the other drank the same amount of tea, every day for the rest of their lives.<ref name="CrozierAshihara2011" />

Two physicians were appointed to supervise the experiment and report its finding to the king.<ref name="Halevy">{{cite book|last=Halevy|first=Alon Y. |title=The Infinite Emotions of Coffee|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5fxXUgPNe8AC&pg=PA77|accessdate=9 February 2012|publisher=Macchiatone Communications|isbn=978-0-9847715-1-6|page=77}}</ref> Unfortunately, both doctors died, presumably of natural causes, before the experiment was completed.<ref name="CrozierAshihara2011" /> Gustav III, who was assassinated in 1792, also died before seeing the final results. Of the twins, the tea drinker was the first to die, at age 83; the date of death of the surviving coffee drinker is unknown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,399983,00.html |title=Die Wunderbohne |trans_title=The amazing bean |last=Herrmann |first=Sebastian |date=11 March 2006 |publisher=[[Spiegel Online]] |language=German|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
In 1794, the government once again tried to impose a ban on coffee. The ban, which was renewed multiple times until the 1820s, was never successful in stamping out coffee-drinking.<ref name="WeinbergBealer2001" /> Once the ban was lifted, coffee became a dominant beverage in Sweden, which has been one of the countries with the [[List of countries by coffee consumption per capita|highest coffee consumption per capita]] in the world since.<ref name="CrozierAshihara2011">{{cite book|last1=Crozier|first1=Alan|last2=Ashihara|first2=Hiroshi|last3=Tomás-Barbéran|first3=Francisco|title=Teas, Cocoa and Coffee: Plant Secondary Metabolites and Health|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=muk4bokwmuQC&pg=PA21|accessdate=9 February 2012|date=26 September 2011|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=978-1-4443-4706-7|page=21}}</ref>

The experiment has jokingly been called "the first Swedish [[clinical trial]]".<ref name="Linné">{{cite web |url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/pharm/kaffete.html |title=Coffee – rat poison or miracle medicine? |work= |publisher=[[Uppsala University]] |accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref>
