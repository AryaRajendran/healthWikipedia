The '''lacrimal nerve''' is the smallest of the three branches of the [[ophthalmic division]] of the [[trigeminal nerve]]. 

It sometimes receives a filament from the [[trochlear nerve]], but this is possibly derived from the branch that goes from the ophthalmic to the [[trochlear nerve]]. 

It passes forward in a separate tube of [[dura mater]], and enters the orbit through the narrowest part of the [[superior orbital fissure]]. 

In the orbit it runs along the upper border of the [[lateral rectus muscle|lateral rectus]], with the [[lacrimal artery]], and communicates with the [[zygomatic branch]] of the [[maxillary nerve]]. 

It enters the [[lacrimal gland]] and gives off several filaments, which supply sensory innervation to the gland and the [[conjunctiva]]. 

Then, it pierces the [[orbital septum]], and ends in the skin of the upper [[eyelid]], joining with filaments of the [[facial nerve]]. 

The lacrimal nerve is occasionally absent, and its place is then taken by the [[zygomaticotemporal branch]] of the [[maxillary nerve]]. Sometimes the latter branch is absent, and a continuation of the lacrimal nerve is substituted for it.

==Functions==
It provides sensory innervations for the [[lacrimal gland]], [[conjunctiva]], and the lateral upper eyelids.

The zygomatic nerve carries sensory fibers from the skin and mucous membranes. It also carries post-synaptic parasympathetic fibers (originating in the pterygopalatine ganglion) to the lacrimal nerve via a communication. These fibers will eventually provide innervation to the lacrimal gland.
