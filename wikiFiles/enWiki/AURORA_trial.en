The '''AURORA trial''' (A Study to Evaluate the Use of [[Rosuvastatin]] in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events) was a [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized]], [[double-blind]], [[placebo-controlled study]] investigating the use of [[rosuvastatin]] in the prevention of [[cardiovascular disease]] among patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis.<ref name=AURORA>{{cite journal |author=Fellstrom BC, Jardine AG, et al |title=Rosuvastatin and Cardiovascular Events in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=360 |issue=14 |pages=1395–1407 |year=2009 |month=April|pmid= 19332456|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0810177|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/360/14/1395?query=TOC}}</ref>

The trial was undertaken because although patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at high risk of adverse cardiovascular events, no large clinical trial had confirmed the benefit of [[lipid]] lowering agents. The AURORA trial sought to fill this gap.<ref name=rationale>{{cite journal |author=Fellstrom BC |title=Effect of rosuvastatin on outcomes in chronic haemodialysis patients – design and rationale of the AURORA study |journal=Curr Control Trials Cardiovasc Med|volume=6 |issue=1|year=2005 |pmid=15910680 |doi=10.1186/1468-6708-6-9 |last2=Zannad |first2=F |last3=Schmieder |first3=R |last4=Holdaas |first4=H |last5=Jardine |first5=A |last6=Rose |first6=H |last7=Wilpshaar |first7=W |last8=Aurora Study |first8=Group |pages=9 |pmc=1175096}}</ref> 

The trial was conducted across 280 medical centers in 25 countries.  The study randomized 2776 patients, aged 50–80 years and undergoing maintenance [[hemodialysis]], to one of two groups.  One group received rosuvastatin 10&nbsp;mg daily and the other group received a [[placebo]].   The combined primary end point was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal [[myocardial infarction]], or nonfatal [[stroke]].  Although the mean [[LDL cholesterol]] was reduced by 43% in the rosuvastatin arm of the study at three months, no difference in the primary end point was demonstrated at an average follow-up of 3.8 years.<ref name = AURORA/>

The trial was sponsored, in part, by [[AstraZeneca]], the marketer of [[Crestor]].
