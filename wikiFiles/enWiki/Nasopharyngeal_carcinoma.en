'''Nasopharyngeal carcinoma''' (NPC) is the most common [[cancer]] originating in the [[nasopharynx]], the uppermost region of the [[pharynx]] ("throat"), behind the nose where the [[Nasal cavity|nasal passages]] and [[eustachian tube|auditory tubes]] join the remainder of the [[upper respiratory tract]]. NPC differs significantly from other [[head and neck cancer|cancers of the head and neck]] in its [[epidemiology|occurrence]], [[etiology|causes]], clinical behavior, and treatment. It is vastly more common in certain regions of [[East Asia]] and [[Africa]] than elsewhere, with [[virus|viral]], [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary and [[human genetics|genetic]] factors implicated in its causation. It is most common in males. It is a squamous cell carcinoma or an undifferentiated type. Squamous cells are a flat type of cell found in the skin and the membranes that line some body cavities. Differentiation means how different the cancer cells are from normal cells. Undifferentiated is a word used to describe cells that do not have their mature features or functions. 

==Classification==
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, commonly known as nasopharyngeal cancer, is classified as a malignant [[neoplasia|neoplasm]], or [[cancer]], arising from the [[mucosa]]l [[epithelium]] of the [[nasopharynx]], most often within the ''lateral nasopharyngeal recess'' or ''fossa of Rosenmüller'' (a recess behind the entrance of the [[Eustachian Tube]] opening). The World Health Organization Classifies Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in three types.  Type 1 (I) is squamous cell carcinoma.  Type 2a (II) is keratinizing undifferentiated carcinoma.  Type 2b (III) is nonkeratinizing undifferentiated carcinoma.  <ref>Cummings Otolaryngology. 5th ed.  (2010).  Chapter 99.  pg 1344</ref>Type 2b (III) nonkeratinizing undifferentiated form is most common, and is most strongly associated with [[Epstein-Barr virus]] infection of the cancerous cells.<ref name="Weidner's">{{cite book |author=Richard Cote, Saul Suster, Lawrence Weiss, Noel Weidner (Editor) |title=Modern Surgical Pathology (2 Volume Set) |publisher=W B Saunders |location=London |year= 2002|pages= |isbn=0-7216-7253-1 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

==Staging==

Staging of Nasophayngeal Carcinoma is based on clinical and radiologic examination.  Most patients present with Stage III or IV disease.  

'''Stage I''' is a small tumor confined to nasopharynx.

'''Stage II''' is a tumor extending in the local area, or that with any evidence of limited neck (nodal) disease.

'''Stage III''' is a large tumor with or without neck disease, or a tumor with bilateral neck disease.

'''Stage IV''' is a large tumor involving intracranial or infratemporal regions, an extensive neck disease, and/or any distant metastasis.

==Symptoms and signs==
Cervical lymphadenopathy (disease or swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck) is the initial presentation in many patients, and the diagnosis of NPC is often made by lymph node [[biopsy]]. Symptoms related to the primary tumor include [[trismus]], pain, [[otitis media]], nasal regurgitation due to [[paresis]] (loss of or impaired movement) of the soft palate, hearing loss and cranial nerve [[:wikt:palsy|palsies]] (paralysis). Larger growths may produce nasal obstruction or bleeding and a "nasal twang". [[Metastasis |Metastatic spread]]  may result in bone pain or organ dysfunction. Rarely, a [[paraneoplastic syndrome]] of osteoarthropathy (diseases of joints and bones) may occur with widespread disease.

==Causes==
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is associated with infection with [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV).<ref name=WHO/> The detection of nuclear antigen associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBNA) and viral DNA in NPC type 2 and 3, has revealed that EBV can infect epithelial cells and is associated with their transformation. The [[etiology]] of NPC (particularly the [[Endemism|endemic]] form) seems to follow a multi-step process, in which EBV, ethnic background, and environmental [[carcinogen]]s all seem to play an important role. Lo et al. showed that EBV DNA was detectable in the [[blood plasma]] samples of 96% of patients with non-keratinizing NPC, compared with only 7% in controls[9]. More importantly, EBV DNA levels appear to correlate with treatment response and may predict disease recurrence, suggesting that they may be an independent indicator of prognosis. In adults, other likely [[etiology |etiological]] factors include genetic susceptibility, consumption of food (in particular salted fish)<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Yu | first1 = M.

In children, the presence of Epstein-Barr virus in blood is considered a predictor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

==Treatment==
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma can be treated by surgery, by [[chemotherapy]], or by [[Radiation therapy|radiotherapy]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Bernadette|date=June&nbsp;26, 2006|title=Nasopharyngeal carcinoma|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|volume=1:23|pages=1–5|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-1-23|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1750-1172-1-23.pdf}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
NPC is uncommon in the [[United States]] and most other nations, representing less than 1 case per 100,000 in most populations.<ref name=WHO>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/viral_cancers/en/index1.html|title=Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR): Viral cancers|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2 October 2012}}</ref> but is extremely common in [[Southern China|southern regions of China]],<ref name="pmid18570662">{{cite journal |author=Fang W, Li X, Jiang Q, |title=Transcriptional patterns, biomarkers and pathways characterizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma of Southern China |journal=J Transl Med |volume=6 |issue= |pages=32 |year=2008 |pmid=18570662 |pmc=2443113 |doi=10.1186/1479-5876-6-32 |url=http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/6//32 |display-authors=2}}</ref> particularly in [[Guangdong]] accounting for 18% of all cancers in [[China]].<ref name="chang2006">{{cite journal |author=Chang E T, Adami H |title=The Enigmatic Epidemiology of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma |journal=Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1765–1777 |year=2006 |doi=10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0353 |pmid=17035381}}</ref> It is sometimes referred to as '''Cantonese cancer''' because it occurs in about 25 cases per 100,000 people in this region, 25 times higher than the rest of the world.<ref name="chang2006" />  It is also quite common in [[Taiwan]].<ref name="chang2006" /> This could be due to the South East Asian diet which typically includes consumption of salted vegetables, fish and meat.<ref name="chang2006" /> While NPC is seen primarily in middle-aged persons in [[Asia]], a high proportion of [[Africa]]n cases appear in children.
