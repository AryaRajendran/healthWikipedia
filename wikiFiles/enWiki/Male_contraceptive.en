'''Male [[contraceptives]]''' are methods of preventing pregnancy that primarily involve the male physiology. The most common kinds of male contraception include [[condom]]s, [[coitus interruptus|withdrawal]] (although medical professionals do not regard withdrawal as an effective method of contraception), [[outercourse]],<ref>http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/mens-sexual-health/birth-control-men-22600.htm</ref> and  [[vasectomy]].<ref name=methods>{{cite journal | pmid = 20933119 | doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2010.03.016 | volume=82 | issue=5 | title=Acceptability of contraception for men: a review | year=2010 | month=November | author=Glasier A | journal=Contraception | pages=453–6}}</ref> In domestic animals, [[castration]] is commonly used for contraception.

In Indian traditional medicine, uses of the [[neem tree]] were described in [[Ayurvedic medicine]], by [[Sushruta]] and in the Rasarathasamucchaya, [[Sarangadhara]], Bhavaprakasha and Bhisagya Ratnavali.  Held traditionally to have antifertility effects, its leaves were demonstrated to reduce pregnancy rate and litter size in a test of male rats.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deshpande VY, Mendulkar KN, Sadre NL |title=Male antifertility activity of Azadirachta Indica in mice |journal=Journal of Postgraduate Medicine |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=167–70 |year=1980 |month=July |pmid=7205685 |url=http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=1980;volume=26;issue=3;spage=167;epage=70;aulast=Deshpande}}</ref>

In 2002, researchers fed extracts from the seeds of papaya fruits (''[[Carica papaya]]'') to monkeys.  Subsequently, the monkeys had no sperm in their ejaculate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lohiya NK |title=Chloroform extract of Carica papaya seeds induces long-term reversible azoospermia in langur monkey |journal=Asian J Androl. |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=17–26 |year=2002 |month=Mar |pmid=11907624 |author-separator=, |author2=Manivannan B |author3=Mishra PK |display-authors=3 |last4=Pathak |first4=N |last5=Sriram |first5=S |last6=Bhande |first6=SS |last7=Panneerdoss |first7=S }}</ref>  Traditionally used for contraception, papaya seeds had no apparent ill effects on the testes or other organs of rats tested with a long-term treatment.<ref>{{cite pmid|19914367}}</ref>

In 2002, tests were performed on male [[rat]]s using [[oleanolic acid]], extracted from ''[[Eugenia jambolana]]'', a tree in the southern part of [[Africa]].

[[Heat-based contraception]], dating in concept to the writings of [[Hippocrates]], involves heating the testicles to prevent the formation of sperm.  Requiring the maintenance of testes at {{convert|116|°F|°C}} (just below the threshold of pain) for 45 minutes, it is not a widely appealing technique, but a variant employing [[ultrasound]] has been under investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmalecontraception.org/new-methods-3/ultrasound/|title=Heat Methods of Male Contraception|publisher=Male Conception Information Project}}</ref>

==Methods in development==

=== Pharmaceutical methods ===
* [[Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance|RISUG/VasalGel]] consists of injecting a polymer gel, [[styrene maleic anhydride]] in [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], into the [[vas deferens]]. The polymer has a positive charge, and when negatively charged sperm pass through the vas deferens, the charge differential severely damages the sperm.<ref name="bare_url">[http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2011/08/08/expanding-options-for-male-contraception/] Expanding Options for Male Contraception.

Retrieved April 1, 2012.</ref>  A second injection washes out the substance and restores fertility. {{As of|2011}}, RISUG is in [[Clinical_trial#Phase_III|Phase III]] of human testing in India and has been patented in India, China, Bangladesh and the United States.

* Inhibition of [[chromatin remodeling]] by binding to a pocket on [[BRDT]] has been shown to produce reversible sterility in male mice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-08/dci-amc081412.php |title=A male contraceptive pill in the making? |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> [[JQ1]], a selective BRDT inhibitor which acts in this manner, is currently under development as a non-hormonal male contraceptive drug.

* [[Immunocontraception]] targeting sperm [[antigen]]s has been found to be effective in male primates.<ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Rand|first=MG|coauthors=EE Widgren, P Sivashanmugam, RT Richardson, SH Hall, FS French, CA Vande Voort, SG Ramachandra, V Ramesh, A Jagannadha Roa|title=Reversible immunocontraception in male monkeys immunized with Eppin|journal=Science|year=2004|volume=306|pages=1189–90|doi=10.1126/science.1099743|pmid=15539605|issue=5699}}</ref>

One goal of research is to develop a '''male oral contraceptive''', a male contraceptive that can be taken in pill form by mouth, similar to the existing [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptive pill]] for women.<ref>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120816121950.htm</ref>

* [[Calcium channel blocker]]s such as [[nifedipine]] may cause reversible infertility by altering the lipid metabolism of sperm so that they are not able to fertilize an egg.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hershlag A, Cooper GW, Benoff S |title=Pregnancy following discontinuation of a calcium channel blocker in the male partner |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=599–606 |year=1995 |month=March |pmid=7782439 |url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7782439}}</ref> Recent Research at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University show that as of June 2010, such a pill may be five years away.

* A compound that interferes with the [[vitamin A]] pathway has been shown to render male mice sterile for the course of the treatment without affecting [[libido]].  Once taken off the compound, the mice continued to make [[sperm]]. The [[mechanism of action]] includes blocking the conversion of vitamin A into its active form [[retinoic acid]] which binds to retinoic receptors which is needed to initiate sperm production.<ref name=livescience>Parry, Wynne [http://www.livescience.com/14440-male-birth-control-pill-sperm-vitamin.html?_r=1&hp "New Male Birth Control Concept Shows Promise"], ''LiveScience, June 4, 2011, accessed June 6, 2011.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21505053 | year = 2011 | last1 = Chung | first1 = SS | last2 = Wang | first2 = X | last3 = Roberts | first3 = SS | last4 = Griffey | first4 = SM | last5 = Reczek | first5 = PR | last6 = Wolgemuth | first6 = DJ | title = Oral Administration of a Retinoic Acid Receptor Antagonist Reversibly Inhibits Spermatogenesis in Mice | volume = 152 | issue = 6 | pages = 2492–2502 | doi = 10.1210/en.2010-0941 | pmc = 3100616 | journal = Endocrinology}}</ref> This can be done, for instance, by blocking an [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] called RALDH3 (ALDH1A2), which converts [[retinaldehyde]] into retionic acid in testes.

* [[Silodosin]], an α1-adrenoceptor antagonist with high uroselectivity, has been shown to completely block ejaculation in human males while permitting the sensation of orgasm.

* [[Trestolone]] is an anabolic steroid that has been shown to significantly reduce sperm count.

=== Surgical methods ===
* [[Vasectomy]] is a surgical procedure for male sterilization and/or permanent birth control. During the procedure, the vasa deferentia of a man are severed, and then tied/sealed in a manner such to prevent sperm from entering into the seminal stream (ejaculate). Vasectomies are usually performed in a physician's office or medical clinic. CDC research has estimated there is a probability of 11 failures per 1,000 procedures over 2 years; half of the failures occurred in the first three months after the vasectomy, and no failures occurred after 72 weeks. Due to the presence of sperm retained beyond the blocked vasa deferentia, vasectomies only become effective about three months following the operation.<ref><http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control-4211.htm >.</ref>

* [[Vas-occlusive contraception]] consists of partially or completely blocking the [[vas deferens]], the tubes connecting the [[epididymis]] to the [[urethra]].  While a [[vasectomy]] removes a piece of each vas deferens, the ''intra vas device'' (IVD) and other injectable plugs only block the tubes until the devices are removed.<ref name="Finn"/>

=== Non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical methods===
* Research on the safety and effectiveness of using [[ultrasound]] treatments to kill sperm has undergone since the idea originally came about following experiments in the 1970s by Mostafa S. Fahim which noticed ultrasound killed microbes and decreased fertility.<ref name=Murray>{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Rheana|title=Ultrasound kills sperm, could be the future of male birth control: study|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_19843262|publisher=[[Daily News (New York){{!}}Daily News]]|accessdate=30 January 2012|month=30 January|year=2012}}</ref> As of 2012 a study conducted on rats found that two 15-minute treatments of ultrasound delivered 2 days apart in a warm salt bath effectively lowered their sperm count to below fertile levels.<ref name="Tsuruta"/><ref name=Murray/> Another small study involved dogs, and found that after three ultrasound applications the dogs' ejaculate contained no sperm.<ref name="bare_url" /> Further experiments on its effectiveness on humans, the longevity of the results, and its safety have yet to be conducted.<ref name=Murray/>

===Abandoned research===
* [[Miglustat]] (Zavesca or NB-DNJ) is a drug approved for treatment of several rare lipid storage disorder diseases.  In mice, it provided effective and fully reversible contraception.  But it seems this effect was only true for several genetically related strains of laboratory mice.
