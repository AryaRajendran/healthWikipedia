The '''peritoneum''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|p|ɛr|ɨ|t|ə|n|ˈ|i|əm}}) is the [[serous membrane]] that forms the lining of the [[abdominal cavity]] or the [[coelom]]—it covers most of the intra-abdominal (or coelomic) organs—in [[amniote]]s and some invertebrates ([[annelid]]s, for instance). It is composed of a layer of [[mesothelium]] supported by a thin layer of [[connective tissue]].
The peritoneum both supports the abdominal organs and serves as a conduit for their [[blood]] and [[lymph]] vessels and [[nerves]].

The abdominal cavity (the space bounded by the [[vertebrae]], [[abdominal muscles]], [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and [[pelvic floor]]) should not be confused with the '''intraperitoneal space''' (located within the abdominal cavity, but wrapped in peritoneum). The structures within the intraperitoneal space are called "intraperitoneal" (e.g. the [[stomach]]), the structures in the abdominal cavity that are located behind the intraperitoneal space are called "[[retroperitoneal]]" (e.g. the [[kidney]]s), and those structures below the intraperitoneal space are called "subperitoneal" or "infraperitoneal" (e.g. the [[bladder]]).

==Structure==
===Layers===
Although they ultimately form one continuous sheet, two types or layers of peritoneum and a potential space between them are referenced:
* The outer layer, called the ''parietal peritoneum'', is attached to the [[abdominal wall]] and the [[pelvic walls]].<ref>Tank, P. (2013) ''Grants Dissector'' 15th ed., ch.4 ''The abdomen'', p.99</ref>
* The inner layer, the ''visceral peritoneum'', is wrapped around the internal organs that are located inside the intraperitoneal space. It is thinner than the parietal peritoneum.
* The potential space between these two layers is the ''[[peritoneal cavity]]''; it is filled with a small amount (about 50 mL) of slippery [[serous fluid]] that allows the two layers to slide freely over each other.
* The term [[mesentery]] is often used to refer to a double layer of visceral peritoneum. There are often blood vessels, nerves, and other structures between these layers. The space between these two layers is technically outside of the peritoneal sac, and thus not in the peritoneal cavity.

===Subdivisions===
Peritoneal folds are omenta, mesenteries and ligaments; they connect organs to each other or to the abdominal wall.<ref name="Drake2009p295">Drake et al. (2009) Grays Anatomy for Students, 2nd Edition, ''Abdominal Viscera'', p.406</ref> There are two main regions of the peritoneum, connected by the [[epiploic foramen]] (also known as the ''omental foramen'' or ''foramen of winslow''):
* The [[greater sac]] (or ''general cavity of the abdomen''), represented in red in the diagrams above.
* The [[lesser sac]] (or ''omental bursa''), represented in blue. The lesser sac is divided into two "omenta":
** The [[lesser omentum]] (or ''gastrohepatic'') is attached to the [[lesser curvature of the stomach]] and the [[liver]].
** The [[greater omentum]] (or ''gastrocolic'') hangs from the [[greater curve of the stomach]] and loops down in front of the [[intestines]] before curving back upwards to attach to the transverse [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]. In effect it is draped in front of the intestines like an apron and may serve as an insulating or protective layer.

The [[mesentery]] is the part of the peritoneum through which most abdominal organs are attached to the abdominal wall and supplied with [[blood]] and [[lymph]] vessels and nerves.

In addition, in the [[pelvic cavity]] there are several structures that are usually named not for the peritoneum, but for the areas defined by the peritoneal folds:

 | [[Vesicouterine pouch]] || Between urinary bladder and uterus || Female only
 |-
 | [[Pararectal fossa]]|| Surrounding rectum || Male and female
 |-
 | [[Paravesical fossa]] || Surrounding urinary bladder || Male and female
|}

==Development==
The peritoneum develops ultimately from the [[mesoderm]] of the [[trilaminar embryo]]. As the mesoderm differentiates, one region known as the [[lateral plate mesoderm]] splits to form two layers separated by an [[intraembryonic coelom]]. These two layers develop later into the visceral and parietal layers found in all [[serous cavity|serous cavities]], including the peritoneum.

As an [[embryo]] develops, the various abdominal organs grow into the abdominal cavity from structures in the abdominal wall. In this process they become enveloped in a layer of peritoneum. The growing organs "take their blood vessels with them" from the abdominal wall, and these blood vessels become covered by peritoneum, forming a mesentery.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

Peritoneal folds develop from the [[ventral mesentery|ventral]]and [[dorsal mesentery]] of the embryo.<ref name="Drake2009p295"/>

==Clinical aspects==
===Peritoneal dialysis===
In one form of [[dialysis]], called '''[[peritoneal dialysis]]''', a glucose solution is sent through a tube into the peritoneal cavity. The fluid is left there for a prescribed amount of time to absorb waste products, and then removed through the tube. The reason for this effect is the high number of arteries and veins in the peritoneal cavity. Through the mechanism of [[diffusion]], waste products are removed from the blood.

===Primary peritoneal carcinoma===
{{main|Primary peritoneal carcinoma}}
Primary peritoneal cancer is a cancer of the cells lining the peritoneum.

==Classification of abdominal structures==
The structures in the abdomen are classified as intraperitoneal, [[retroperitoneal]] or infraperitoneal depending on whether they are covered with visceral peritoneum and whether they are attached by mesenteries (mensentery, mesocolon).

{| class="wikitable" style="width: 100%;"
| '''Intraperitoneal''' || '''Retroperitoneal''' || '''Infraperitoneal / Subperitoneal'''
 |-
 | Stomach, First part of the duodenum [5&nbsp;cm], jejunum, ileum, cecum, [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], [[transverse colon]], [[sigmoid colon]], rectum (upper 1/3)  || The rest of the duodenum, [[ascending colon]], [[descending colon]], rectum (middle 1/3) || Rectum (lower 1/3)
 |-
 | Liver, spleen, [[pancreas]] (only tail)|| Pancreas (except tail) ||
 |-
 | || Kidneys, [[adrenal gland]]s, [[ureter|proximal ureters]], [[renal artery|renal vessels]]
|| Urinary bladder, [[ureter|distal ureters]]
 |-
 | In women: uterus, [[fallopian tube]]s, ovaries   || [[gonadal artery|Gonadal blood vessels]] ||
 |-
 | || [[Inferior vena cava]], [[aorta]] ||
|}

Structures that are ''intraperitoneal'' are generally mobile, while those that are ''retroperitoneal'' are relatively fixed in their location.

Some structures, such as the kidneys, are "primarily retroperitoneal", while others such as the majority of the duodenum, are "secondarily retroperitoneal", meaning that structure developed intraperitoneally but lost its mesentery and thus became retroperitoneal.

==Etymology==
''Peritoneum'' is derived from Greek via Latin. ''Peri-'' means ''around'', while ''-ton-'' refers to stretching. Thus, peritoneum means ''stretched around'' or ''stretched over''.
