The [[fluoroquinolones]] are [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[broad-spectrum antibiotics]]. In general, the common side-effects are mild to moderate and self-limiting. However, occasional serious [[adverse effects]] can occur. A study performed by the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that adverse events leading to an emergency room visit occur at a rate of 9.2 for every 10,000 fluoroquinolone prescriptions.  This rate is greater than that for cephalosporins (6.1 per 10,000) and macrolides (5.1 per 10,000), but less than for sulfonamides (18.9 per 10,000), penicillins (13 per 10,000), clindamycin (18.5 per 10,000), and vancomycin (24.1 per 10,000).<ref name="pmid18694344">{{cite journal |author=Shehab N, Patel PR, Srinivasan A, Budnitz DS |title=Emergency Department Visits for Antibiotic-Associated Adverse Events |journal=Clin.

Broad spectrum antibiotics including fourth generation cephalosporins, clindamycin, and fluoroquinolones may facilitate colonisation with [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and [[Clostridium difficile|''C. difficile'']].

==Background==
Fluoroquinolones are often effective as antibacterial agents. They are recommended for a number of serious bacterial infections, and, in some cases of life-threatening infections, they can be life-saving.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Castro FR, Torres A |title=Optimizing treatment outcomes in severe community-acquired pneumonia |journal=Am J Respir Med |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=39–54 |year=2003 |pmid=14720021 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Niyogi SK |title=Shigellosis |journal=J.

A meta-analysis for fluoroquinolones and skin infections found that fluoroquinolones are associated with more adverse reactions than beta lactams. However the increase was due to a higher rate of mild to moderate nausea and diarrhea.  Side effects severe enough to cause withdrawal from the clinical trial occurred at similar rates.<ref name="Karageorgopoulos-2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = Karageorgopoulos | first1 = DE. | last2 = Giannopoulou | first2 = KP. | last3 = Grammatikos | first3 = AP. | last4 = Dimopoulos | first4 = G. | last5 = Falagas | first5 = ME. | title = Fluoroquinolones compared with β-lactam antibiotics for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal = CMAJ | volume = 178 | issue = 7 | pages = 845–54 | month = Mar | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.071157 | pmid = 18362380 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/178/7/845 | pmc = 2267830 }}</ref>

Rarely, fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been associated with serious and detrimental effects on the [[musculoskeletal system]], [[cardiovascular system]], [[Central Nervous System|CNS]] and [[peripheral nervous system]], [[circulatory system]], [[maxillofacial]] system, [[endocrine]] system, [[gastrointestinal]] system, urological system, the [[liver]], the [[brain]], the [[skin]], and the sensory systems; hearing, sight, taste, touch, and smell.

==Risk factors and interactions==
Certain patient groups are at increased risk of fluoroquinolone ADRs. A 1998 retrospective survey of the use of the fluoroquinolones in the pediatric population showed that the fluoroquinolones were oftentimes prescribed in children, (although their use is not approved in this age group), and that numerous serious side effects had been recorded.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pariente-Khayat | first1 = A. | last2 = Vauzelle-Kervroedan | first2 = F. | last3 = d'Athis | first3 = P. | last4 = Bréart | first4 = G. | last5 = Gendrel | first5 = D. | last6 = Aujard | first6 = Y. | last7 = Olive | first7 = G. | last8 = Pons | first8 = G. | title = [Retrospective survey of fluoroquinolone use in children] | journal = Arch Pediatr | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 484–8 | month = May | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1016/S0929-693X(99)80311-X | pmid = 9759180 }}</ref> Fluoroquinolones are not recommended in patient groups that are predisposed to adverse events (for example, because of [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[G6PD deficiency]], [[renal impairment]], [[myasthenia gravis]], previous psychiatric, seizure disorder, or children (under 18)). An alternative antibiotic class should be used wherever possible in such patients, and,if used, special caution is advised; for example, possible dosage reduction may be required as well as extra vigilance for adverse reactions. There is also an increased risk of adverse events in the elderly, including tendon ruptures and seizures. Use in children or pregnant or breast-feeding women is not recommended and should be avoided. In the UK, the prescribing indications for fluoroquinolones for children is severely restricted. Only inhalant [[anthrax]] and [[pseudomonal]] infections in [[cystic fibrosis]] infections are licensed indications in the UK due to ongoing safety concerns. At the first sign of [[psychiatric]], [[neurological]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[tendonitis]], or [[hypersensitivity]] reactions, fluoroquinolones should be discontinued. Quinolones are contraindicated in patients having had previous quinolone-related tendinopathy. Dose, length of time, and number of exposures to fluoroquinolones, as well as combination with [[corticosteroids]], [[NSAIDs]], or [[theophylline]], increase the risk adverse reactions. Concurrent use of corticosteroids increases the risk of multiskeletal injury, manifesting as chronic [[tendonitis]] or spontaneous ruptures of tendons, muscles, and cartilage. Concurrent use of [[NSAIDs]] may induce severe and prolonged seizures including [[status epilepticus]].<ref name=Robert05/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bnf.org/bnf/bnf/57/3944.htm |title=Quinolones |accessdate=16 February 2009 |author=Committee on Safety of Medicines |authorlink=Committee on Safety of Medicines |coauthors=Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency |year=2008 |publisher=[[British National Formulary]] |location=United Kingdom }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |author=Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc |coauthors= |title=CIPRO (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride) TABLETS CIPRO,(ciprofloxacin*) ORAL SUSPENSION |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/019537s68,19847s42,19857s49,20780s26,21473s24lbl.pdf |publisher=FDA |location=USA |format=PDF |month=September |year=2008 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref><ref name="pmid11675843">{{cite journal |author=Kushner JM, Peckman HJ, Snyder CR |title=Seizures associated with fluoroquinolones |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=1194–8 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11675843 |doi= 10.1345/aph.10359|url=http://www.theannals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11675843}}</ref><ref name="pmid17911203">{{cite journal |author=Mehlhorn AJ, Brown DA |title=Safety concerns with fluoroquinolones |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=41 |issue=11 |pages=1859–66 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17911203 |doi=10.1345/aph.1K347 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?IA=CA2002000725&DISPLAY=DESC |title=(WO/2002/093162) INDIVIDUALIZATION OF THERAPY WITH ANTIBIOTIC AGENTS |date=21 November 2002 |publisher=World Health Organisation }}</ref> Most cases of fluoroquinolone-precipitated seizures occur in the elderly or those with severe [[cerebral arteriosclerosis]], [[epilepsy]], [[brain tumour]], [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], and [[Alcohol|alcohol dependence]], as well as those taking [[theophylline]] or the [[NSAIDs]].<ref name="pmid11172695" /> Those who are [[Benzodiazepine dependence|benzodiazepine-dependent]] or in [[withdrawal|benzodiazepine withdrawal]] have a higher rate of adverse severe CNS effects possibly due to fluoroquinolones' displacement of benzodiazepines from their receptor site or pre-existing GABA underactivity due to withdrawal, thus leading to an increased sensitivity to fluoroquinolone toxicity.<ref>{{cite web | author= Professor Heather Ashton | year= 2002 | url= http://benzo.org.uk/manual/index.htm | title= Benzodiazepines: How They Work and How to Withdraw }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=McConnell JG |title= Benzodiazepine tolerance, dependency, and withdrawal syndromes and interactions with fluoroquinolone antimicrobials |journal=British Journal of General Practice | publisher = Royal College of General Practitioners |volume=58 |issue=550 |month=May |year =2008 |pages=365–366 |doi=10.3399/bjgp08X280317 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/rcgp/bjgp/2008/00000058/00000550/art00020 |pmid=18482496 |pmc=2435654 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |year=1990 |month=July |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=63–70 |author=Unseld E |coauthors= Ziegler G, Gemeinhardt A, Janssen U, Klotz U |title= Possible interaction of fluoroquinolones with the benzodiazepine-GABAA-receptor complex |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |pmc=1368276 |pmid=2167717 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sternbach H, State R |title=Antibiotics: neuropsychiatric effects and psychotropic interactions |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=214–26 |year=1997 |pmid=9427014 |doi= 10.3109/10673229709000304|url=}}</ref> [[Articaine]] may worsen certain symptoms in an individual with fluoroquinolone toxicity.

==Adverse reactions and toxicities==

===Adverse reactions===
The most common adverse effects of the [[fluoroquinolones]] involve the gastrointestinal tract, skin, CNS, and PNS.

The spectrum of this disease ranges from asymptomatic carrier state to life-threatening [[pseudomembranous colitis]] and [[toxic megacolon]]. Pathogenesis of pseudomembranous colitis results from the suppression of the natural microflora of the colon by broad spectrum antibiotics, which creates an environment favorable for ''C. difficile'' proliferation. A ''Clostridium difficile'' infection is the principal cause of nosocomial, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and pseudomembranous colitis. ''C. difficile'' can be fatal if left untreated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cain DB, O'Connor ME |title=Pseudomembranous colitis associated with ciprofloxacin |journal=Lancet |volume=336 |issue=8720 |page=946 |year=1990 |month=October |pmid=1976960 |doi= 10.1016/0140-6736(90)92320-H|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pérez-Calvo JI, Matamala C, Sanjoaquín I, Amores M, Castillo J, Bueno-Gómez J |title=[Diarrhea following antibiotic treatment, Clostridium difficile, and quinolones] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Enferm.

Any CNS side-effect occurs with an incidence of 1–2%.<ref name=Robert05/>  Adverse event reporting for antibiotics found that 12.2% of adverse reaction reports concerning fluoroquinolones involved the CNS versus 3.6% for other antibiotics.<ref name=Robert05/> Newer agents to have a lower risk of side-effects have been found.<ref name=Bell1999/> Seizures are rare, and usually occur when they do in those with an underlying CNS disorder.<ref name=Robert05/> However, caution use in patient with epilepsy is still advised.<ref name=Robert05/> Very rare cases of suicidal behavior have been reported to occur, sometimes after a single dose.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanofi-aventis.co.uk/products/Tavanic500mgTabs_SPC.pdf |title=Tavanic SPC |work=Sanofi-aventis |accessdate=}}</ref> Drugs that induce suicidal ideation, including antibiotics, are associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Robertson | first1 = HT. | last2 = Allison | first2 = DB. | title = Drugs Associated with More Suicidal Ideations Are also Associated with More Suicide Attempts | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 10 | pages = e7312 | month = | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0007312 | pmid = 19798416 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007312  | pmc = 2749439  | last3 = Wright  | first3 = James M.  | editor1-last = Wright  | editor1-first = James M. }}</ref>

Fluoroquinolones can induce a wide range of serious adverse psychiatric effects. These reactions may manifest as extreme [[anxiety]], [[panic attacks]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anhedonia]], [[cognitive dysfunction]] (or brain fog), [[depersonalization]], [[paranoia]], [[hallucinations]], [[toxic psychosis]], [[seizures]], [[tremors]], taste perversions, abnormal dreams, chronic [[insomnia]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[delirium]], [[suicidal thoughts]], and usually involves all five senses. For some people the symptoms resolve relatively soon after discontinuing the fluoroquinolone; for others, in the case of a [[neurotoxic]] effect, symptomatology may persist for months or even years after discontinuation.<ref name="pmid11172695"/><ref name="pnawf">{{cite journal | author =Cohen JS | year =2001 | month =December | title =Peripheral Neuropathy Associated with Fluoroquinolones | journal =Ann Pharmacother | volume =35 | issue =12 | pages =1540–7 | pmid =11793615 | url =http://fqvictims.org/fqvictims/News/neuropathy/Neuropathy.pdf | format =PDF | doi =10.1345/aph.1Z429 }}</ref> Fluoroquinolones are associated with a significant number of serious psychiatric events.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Doussau de Bazignan A, Thiessard F, Miremont-Salamé G, Conri C, Haramburu F |title=[Psychiatric adverse effects of fluoroquinolone: review of cases from the French pharmacologic surveillance database] |language=French |journal=Rev Med Interne |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=448–52 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16580096 |doi=10.1016/j.revmed.2006.02.003 |url=}}</ref>

In addition, the fluoroquinolones may show depressant activity on the CNS, as was indicated by the depressant syndrome, decreased spontaneous motor activity, and hypothermia found in animal studies. Concomitant use of NSAIDs may increase seizure risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rollof J, Vinge E |title=Neurologic adverse effects during concomitant treatment with ciprofloxacin, NSAIDS, and chloroquine: possible drug interaction |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=1058–9 |year=1993 |month=September |pmid=8219437 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

The fluoroquinolones are known as GABA inhibitors and as such have the ability to bind to neuroreceptor sites within the brain that appear to play a role in CNS adverse events. In recent years, extensive in vivo and in vitro experiments have been performed, and several mechanisms are thought to be responsible. The involvement of GABA and excitatory amino acid (EAA) neurotransmission as well as the kinetics of fluoroquinolone distribution in brain tissue are thought to be responsible.<ref name="pmid11172695" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dodd PR, Davies LP, Watson WE, ''et al.'' |title=Neurochemical studies on quinolone antibiotics: effects on glutamate, GABA and adenosine systems in mammalian CNS |journal=Pharmacol.

===Dermatological effects===
Photosensitivity reactions as well as life-threatening cutaneous reactions have been reported with the fluoroquinolone class.  Such reactions include [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[Sweet's syndrome]], toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and painful and disfiguring rashes.  In 2008, Bayer issued a European "Dear Doctor Letter" advising physicians of the risk of potentially life-threatening bullous skin reactions like Stevens-Johnson-Syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) associated with moxifloxacin (Avelox).<ref name=con014103/>

To our knowledge, as of 1997, a total of 6 cases have been reported in the literature documenting an association between oral ciprofloxacin administration and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens–Johnson syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |issn= 1018-8665|pmid=9310730 |year= 1997 |month=  |author= Livasy, Ca; Kaplan, Am |title= Ciprofloxacin-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis: a case report |volume= 195 |issue= 2 |pages= 173–5 |journal= Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland) |url= |doi= 10.1159/000245726 }}</ref> A review performed in Sweden (circa 2003) found a total of nine cases.  Together with previous data from the literature, these reports support the view that ciprofloxacin, as well as other fluoroquinolones, has the potential to cause fatal or severe adverse cutaneous events.<ref>{{cite journal |issn= 0190-9622|pmid=14576649 |year= 2003 |month= Nov |author= Hällgren, J; Tengvall-Linder, M; Persson, M; Wahlgren, Cf |title= Stevens–Johnson syndrome associated with ciprofloxacin: a review of adverse cutaneous events reported in Sweden as associated with this drug |volume= 49 |issue= 5 Suppl |pages= S267–9 |doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(03)00478-X |journal= Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology}}</ref>

Photosensitivity reactions reported with the fluoroquinolones mimic those of sunburn, with erythema and edema in the milder forms, and painful blistering with subsequent peeling when severe. A wide spectrum of cutaneous ADRs are reported with fluoroquinolones.

The phototoxic potentials of fluoroquinolones are influenced not only by the substituent at position 8 (Halogenation at position C8) but also by those at position 1. Drugs such as Lomefloxacin and
Sparfloxcacin, with a C8-fluorine substituent, and Clinafloxacin, with a C8-chlorine substituent, exhibit a greater incidence of  phototoxic reactions than drugs without this substituent.<ref>{{cite journal |issn= 0305-7453|pmid=8056688 |year= 1994 |month= Apr |author= Domagala, Jm |title= Structure-activity and structure-side-effect relationships for the quinolone antibacterials |volume= 33 |issue= 4 |pages= 685–706 |journal= The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy |doi= 10.1093/jac/33.4.685}}</ref> Clinafloxacin was subsequently removed from clinical use due to severe phototoxicity reactions and in June 1995 The Medicines Agency restricted the use of Sparfloxacin due to the large number of reports of phototoxicity associated with its use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/coordination/CL12.pdf |title=products_0_Start |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29}}</ref>

A previous dematologic ADR to a fluoroquinolone can sensitize a patient to more severe adverse reactions (with onset after only a single dose of the subsequent fluoroquinolone), as noted
earlier in this presentation.<ref name=pmid15827068/> This is also true of other commonly used antibacterial classes, including the penicillins and cephalosporins.
Patients having developed any kind of rash to a fluoroquinolone in the past have a potential to develop life-threatening photoallergic reactions when re-challenged with a fluoroquinolone drug later on in life.

===PNS effects===
[[Peripheral neuropathy]] has been rarely reported.  Symptoms may include [[paresthesia]] (tingling), [[hypoesthesia]] (numbness), [[dysesthesia]] (pain), and weakness.<ref name=FDA/> Therapy should be discontinued if any neurological symptoms develop in order to prevent the occurrence of a possible irreversible condition.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/SAFETY/2004/jul04.htm |title=MedWatch - July 2004 Safety-Related Drug Labeling Changes - Detailed |work=Food and Drug Administration (United States) |accessdate=}}</ref> Rare cases of sensory impairment involving taste or smell have been reported with a number of fluoroquinolones and may last for up to several months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/40/suppl_1/83.pdf |title=Safety profile of grepafloxacin compared with other fluoroquinolones |work=Ralf Stahlmann and Rudolf Schwabe |accessdate=}}</ref>

Fluoroquinolones have been shown since 1998 to cause irreversible [[peripheral neuropathy]]. Typical symptoms involve [[fasciculations]], [[paresthesia]], [[tinnitus]], [[hyperacusis]], and other sensorimotor problems. Symptoms usually occur after a delayed onset, and continue to worsen. Quinolone-induced peripheral neuropathy usually presents as burning pain and numbness, and in some cases this becomes an irreversible condition that disables the patient for life. Most often this is the result of quinolone-induced damage to the peripheral nervous system (as noted above), manifesting as painful burning, cold, stinging, tingling paresthesias, or numbness. This may also result from muscle and tendon damage as well if the pain is of a burning or stabbing nature upon use of the limb affected. The exact manner in which the fluoroquinolones cause such PNS damage remains elusive. Several theories point to direct toxicity or vascular involvement. Peripheral neuropathy has been associated with the fluoroquinolone class since 1988 and has been reported in the leading medical journals for over two decades.<ref name=Hedenmalm96/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Aoun M, Jacquy C, Debusscher L, ''et al.'' |title=Peripheral neuropathy associated with fluoroquinolones |journal=Lancet |volume=340 |issue=8811 |page=127 |year=1992 |month=July |pmid=1352007 |doi= 10.1016/0140-6736(92)90460-K|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0140-6736(92)90460-K}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen JS |title=Peripheral neuropathy associated with fluoroquinolones |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=1540–7 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11793615 |doi= 10.1345/aph.1Z429|url=http://www.theannals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11793615}}</ref>

In 2004, the FDA added warnings to the package inserts about the possibility of irreversible fluoroquinolone-innduced peripheral neuropathy.

===Cardiac===
Fluoroquinolones can cause [[QT prolongation]] and, thus, predispose a person to [[Torsades de Pointes]] which is sometimes fatal.<ref name=Gold2006/>  Some members of the quinolone family are more likely to causes an increased QT than others.<ref name=Fala2007>{{cite journal |author=Falagas ME, Rafailidis PI, Rosmarakis ES |title=Arrhythmias associated with fluoroquinolone therapy |journal=Int.

Of the currently available agents, moxifloxacin causes the greatest QT prolongation, while ciprofloxacin is associated with a lowest risk of QT prolongation.<ref name=Fala2007/>

===Blood disorders===
Blood abnormalities are believed to occur in less than one percent of patients.<ref name=Uptodate>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=antibiot/8621&selectedTitle=1~150&source=search_result#33 |title=UpToDate Inc. |work=Uptodate |accessdate=}}</ref>  However, Temafloxacin was removed from clinical use in 1992 due to its side-effects of hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells) and other blood cell abnormalities; kidney dysfunction requiring renal dialysis (in 50% of patients affected); and severe liver dysfunction.<ref name="fda.gov"/>

===Blood sugar abnormalities===
Changes in blood sugar levels may occur with fluoroquinolones.  Risks for this complication includes [[diabetes]], old age, renal failure, and [[sepsis]].  [[Gatifloxacin]] was removed from the market in the US and Canada partly due to its negative effects on blood sugar.<ref name="pmid17911203"/>  Temafloxacin was removed from clinical use in 1992 partially due to several cases of low blood sugar as well.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/98/briefingbook/1998-3454B1_03_WL49.pdf</ref>

===Ocular toxicity===
*Oral and IV use
Oral use and I.V. use of the [[fluoroquinolones]] are associated with a significant number of serious visual disturbances. Patients receiving fluoroquinolones have been reported to have developed visual disturbances, which include color distortion and diplopia (double vision).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ball P |title=Adverse reactions and interactions of fluoroquinolones |journal=Clin Invest Med |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=28–34 |year=1989 |month=February |pmid=2646053 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Such disturbances may present as blurred and dim vision, disturbed vision, flashing lights, diplopia, floaters,as well as decreased visual acuity and cataracts.<ref>The antimicrobial drugs By Eric Michael Scholar, William B.

===Hearing effects===
*Oral and IV use

Hearing loss appears to be a very rare event, while fluoroquinolone-induced tinnitus appears to be far more common. Both oral use and IV use of the fluoroquinolones have been reported to cause hearing loss, decreased hearing acuity, hypoacusis, and tinnitus.<ref name="ReferenceA">Moxifloxacin (Avelox) package insert:

==DNA effects==
The fluoroquinolones exert their therapeutic effects by interfering with bacterial [[DNA replication]] by inhibiting an enzyme complex called [[DNA gyrase]]. Research has indicated that fluoroquinolones at therapeutically used doses have little effect on enzymes involved in DNA replication in mammalian cells including human cells; however, not all subtypes of eucaryotic topoisomerases have been routinely studied in clinical studies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gootz TD, Barrett JF, Sutcliffe JA |title=Inhibitory effects of quinolone antibacterial agents on eucaryotic topoisomerases and related test systems |journal=Antimicrob.
