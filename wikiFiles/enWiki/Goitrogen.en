'''Goitrogens''' are substances that suppress the function of the [[thyroid]] gland by interfering with [[iodine]] uptake, which can, as a result, cause an enlargement of the thyroid, i.e., a [[goiter]].

==Goitrogenic drugs and chemicals==
Chemicals that have been shown to have goitrogenic effects include:
* [[Sulfadimethoxine]], [[propylthiouracil]], [[potassium perchlorate]], and [[iopanoic acid]].<ref name="pmid16367917">{{cite journal |author=Takizawa T, Imai T, Ueda M, Onodera H, Hirose M |title=Comparison of enhancing effects of different goitrogen treatments in combination with beta-estradiol-3-benzoate for establishing a rat two-stage thyroid carcinogenesis model to detect modifying effects of estrogenic compounds |journal=[[Cancer Sci.]] |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=25–31 |year=2006 |pmid=16367917 |doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00132.x}}</ref>

*Ions such as [[thiocyanate]] and [[perchlorate]] decrease iodide uptake by [[competitive inhibition]] and, as a consequence of reduced [[thyroxine]] and [[triiodothyronine]] secretion by the gland, cause, at low doses, an increased release of [[thyrotropin]] (by reduced [[negative feedback]]), which then stimulates the gland.<ref>http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info:doi/10.1289/ehp.02110927</ref>
* [[Amiodarone]] inhibits peripheral conversion of [[thyroxine]] to [[triiodothyronine]]; also interferes with thyroid hormone action.
* [[Lithium]] inhibits thyroid hormone release.
* [[Phenobarbitone]], [[phenytoin]], [[carbamazepine]], [[rifampin]] induce metabolic degradation of triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) and thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>).

==Goitrogenic foods==
Certain [[raw foods]] (cooking partially inactivates the goitrogens, except in the cases of soy and millet<ref>http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com/Goitrogen-Special-Report.html</ref>) have been identified as lightly goitrogenic.  These foods include:
*[[Cassava]] and [[Cabbage]] both due to the foods containing [[thiocyanate]]<ref>http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info:doi/10.1289/ehp.02110927</ref>
*[[Soybean]]s (and soybean products such as [[tofu]], soybean oil, soy flour, soy lecithin)
** Other foods containing [[genistein]] have been implicated as interfering with [[thyroid peroxidase]] in laboratory rats.<ref name="pmid12060828">{{cite journal | author = Doerge DR, Sheehan DM | title = Goitrogenic and estrogenic activity of soy isoflavones | journal = Environ.

Thyroid [[hyperplasia]] has been demonstrated in mice:<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of coconut oil acid diethanolamine condensate (CAS No. 68603-42-9) in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice (dermal studies) |journal=National Toxicology Program technical report series |volume=479 |issue= |pages=5–226 |year=2001 |pmid=12571684 |doi= |last1= National Toxicology |first1= Program}}</ref>

Despite being generally a stimulant, caffeine acts on thyroid function as a suppressant.{{cn|date=October 2012}} Indeed some studies on rats suggest that excess [[caffeine]] in conjunction with a [[Iodine deficiency|lack of iodine]] may promote the formation of [[thyroid cancer]]s.<ref name="pmid12824900">{{cite journal |author=Son HY, Nishikawa A, Kanki K, ''et al.'' |title=Synergistic interaction between excess caffeine and deficient iodine on the promotion of thyroid carcinogenesis in rats pretreated with N-bis(2-hydroxypropyl)nitrosamine |journal=[[Cancer Sci.]] |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=334–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12824900 |doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01442.x}}</ref>

==Foods stimulating thyroid tissue==
Some foods and drinks have an opposite effect on the thyroid gland; that is, they stimulate thyroid function rather than suppressing it, examples being [[avocado]] and [[saturated fat]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
