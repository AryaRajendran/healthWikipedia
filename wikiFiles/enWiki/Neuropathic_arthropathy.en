'''Neuropathic arthropathy''' (or '''neuropathic osteoarthropathy'''), also known as '''Charcot joint''' (often "Charcot foot"), refers to progressive degeneration of a [[weight bearing]] [[joint]], a process marked by bony destruction, [[bone resorption]], and eventual [[deformity]].  Onset is usually insidious.

If this pathological process continues unchecked, it could result in joint deformity, [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]ation and/or [[superinfection]], loss of function, and in the worst case scenario: [[amputation]] or death.  Early identification of joint changes is the best way to limit morbidity.

==Pathogenesis==
Any condition resulting in decreased peripheral sensation, [[proprioception]], and fine [[motor control]]:
*[[Diabetes mellitus]] [[neuropathy]] (the most common in the U.S. today, resulting in destruction of foot and ankle joints), with Charcot joints in 1/600-700 diabetics.  Related to long-term poor glucose control. 
*[[Alcoholic neuropathy]]
*[[Cerebral palsy]]
*[[Leprosy]]
*[[Syphilis]] (''tabes dorsalis''), caused by the organism ''[[Treponema pallidum]]''
*[[Spinal cord injury]]
*[[Myelomeningocele]]
*[[Syringomyelia]]
*Intra-articular [[steroid]] injections
*[[Congenital insensitivity to pain]]

===Underlying Mechanisms===
*Two primary theories have been advanced:
**''Neurotrauma'':  Loss of peripheral sensation and proprioception leads to repetitive [[microtrauma]] to the joint in question; this damage goes unnoticed by the neuropathic patient, and the resultant inflammatory resorption of traumatized bone renders that region weak and susceptible to further trauma.  In addition, poor fine motor control generates unnatural pressure on certain joints, leading to additional microtrauma.
**''Neurovascular'':  Neuropathic patients have dysregulated [[autonomic nervous system]] reflexes, and de-sensitized joints receive significantly greater blood flow.  The resulting [[hyperemia]] leads to increased osteoclastic resorption of bone, and this, in concert with mechanical stress, leads to bony destruction.

In reality, both of these mechanisms probably play a role in the development of a Charcot joint.

===Joint Involvement===
Diabetes is the foremost cause in America today for neuropathic joint disease,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} and the foot is the most affected region. In those with foot deformity, approximately 60% are in the [[Tarsometatarsal articulations|tarsometatarsal joints]] (medial joints affected more than lateral), 30% [[Metatarsophalangeal articulations|Metatarsophalangeal joints]] and 10% have ankle disease. Over half of diabetic patients with neuropathic joints can recall some kind of precipitating trauma, usually minor.

Patients with [[Syphilis#Neurosyphilis|neurosyphilis]] tend to have knee involvement, and patients with [[syringomyelia]] of the spinal cord may demonstrate shoulder deformity.

Hip joint destruction is also seen in neuropathic patients.

==Symptoms and signs==
[[Image:Charcot arthropathy X-ray.jpg|thumb|Oblique view X-ray in a 45-year-old male diabetic revealed a divergent, [[Lisfranc joint|Lisfranc]] [[dislocation]] of the first [[metatarsal]] with associated lesser metatarsal fractures.]]
[[Image:Charcot arthropathy clinical examination.jpg|thumb|The same 45-year-old man with diabetes mellitus presented with a diffusely swollen, warm and non-tender left foot due to Charcot arthropathy. There are no changes to the skin itself.]]
The clinical presentation varies depending on the stage of the disease from mild swelling to severe swelling and moderate deformity. Inflammation, erythema, pain and increased skin temperature (3-7 degrees celsius) around the joint may be noticeable on examination. X-rays may reveal bone resorption and degenerative changes in the joint. These findings in the presence of intact skin and loss of protective sensation are [[pathognomonic]] of acute Charcot arthropathy.

Roughly 75% of patients experience pain, but it is less than what would be expected based on the severity of the clinical and radiographic findings.

==Clinical Findings==
Clinical findings include [[erythema]], [[edema]] and increased temperature in the affected joint. In neuropathic foot joints, [[plantar]] ulcers may be present. Note that it is often difficult to differentiate [[osteomyelitis]] from a Charcot joint, as they may have similar tagged WBC scan and [[MRI]] features (joint destruction, dislocation, edema).  Definitive diagnosis may require bone or [[Synovial membrane|synovial]] biopsy.

==Radiologic Findings==
First, it is important to recognize that two types of abnormality may be detected.  One is termed [[atrophic]], in which there is [[osteolysis]] of the distal metatarsals in the forefoot.  The more common form of destruction is [[hypertrophic]] joint disease, characterized by acute peri-articular fracture and joint dislocation. According to Yochum and Rowe, the "6 D's" of hypertrophy are:  
# Distended joint
# Density increase
# Debris production
# Dislocation
# Disorganization
# Destruction

The natural history of the joint destruction process has a classification scheme of its own, offered by Eichenholtz decades ago:

'''Stage 0:'''  Clinically, there is joint edema, but radiographs are negative.  Note that a bone scan may be positive before a radiograph is, making it a sensitive but not very specific modality.  

'''Stage 1:'''  Osseous fragmentation with joint dislocation seen on [[radiograph]] ("acute Charcot").

'''Stage 2:'''  Decreased local edema, with coalescence of fragments and absorption of fine bone debris

'''Stage 3:'''  No local edema, with consolidation and remodeling (albeit deformed) of fracture fragments.  The foot is now stable.

Destroyed Tarsometatarsal joints in the medial left foot,  with fracture and dislocation of fragments; these are classic findings.  Also note loss of the foot arch and acquired [[flat feet|flat foot]] (pes planus) deformity.

Atrophic Features:
# "Licked candy stick" appearance, commonly seen at the distal aspect of the metatarsals
# Diabetic osteolysis
# Bone resorption

==Treatment==

Once the process is recognized, immobilization with a total contact [[Orthopedic cast|cast]] will help ward off further joint destruction.  [[Pneumatic]] [[walking braces]] are also used.  Surgical correction of a joint is commonly successful in the long-term in these patients.

It can take 6–9 months for the edema and erythema of the affected joint to recede.

==Outcome==
Outcomes vary depending on the location of the disease, the degree of damage to the joint, and whether surgical repair was necessary. Average healing times vary from 55–97 days depending on location. Up to 1–2 years may be required for complete healing.
