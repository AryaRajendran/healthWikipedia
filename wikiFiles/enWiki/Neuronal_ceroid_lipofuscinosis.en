'''Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses''' ('''NCL''') is the general name for a [[family]] of at least eight genetically separate [[neurodegenerative disorder]]s that result from excessive accumulation of lipopigments ([[lipofuscin]]) in the body's tissues. These lipopigments are made up of fats and [[proteins]]. Their name comes from the word stem ''lipo-'', which is a variation on "[[lipid]]" or "fat", and from the term ''pigment'', used because the substances take on a greenish-yellow color when viewed under an ultraviolet light microscope. These lipofuscin materials build up in neuronal cells and many organs, including the [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[myocardium]], and kidneys.

==General characteristics==
The classic characterization of the group of neurodegenerative, [[lysosomal storage disorders]] called the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) is through the progressive, permanent loss of motor and psychological ability with a severe intracellular accumulation of lipofuscins,<ref name=no23>{{cite journal |author=Pardo, C., et al. |title=Accumulation of the adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit c in the mnd mutant mouse |journal=Am J Path |volume=144 |issue=4 |year=1994 |pages=829–835 |url=There are more than eight variants of NCL, found in 1 in 12,500 people worldwide. |pmid=8160780 |pmc=1887237}}</ref><ref name=no12>{{cite journal |author=Narayan SB, Pastor JV, Mitchison HM, Bennett MJ |title=CLN3L, a novel protein related to the Batten disease protein, is overexpressed in Cln3-/- mice and in Batten disease |journal=Brain |volume=127 |issue=Pt 8 |pages=1748–54 |year=2004 |month=Aug |pmid=15240430 |doi=10.1093/brain/awh195 }}</ref> with the United States and northern European populations having slightly higher frequency with an occurrence of 1 in 10,000.<ref name=no15>{{cite journal |author=Vesa J, Chin MH, Oelgeschläger K, ''et al.'' |title=Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are connected at molecular level: interaction of CLN5 protein with CLN2 and CLN3 |journal=Mol Biol Cell |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=2410–20 |year=2002 |month=Jul |pmid=12134079 |pmc=117323 |doi=10.1091/mbc.E02-01-0031 }}</ref> There are four classic diagnoses that have received the most attention from researchers and the medical field, differentiated from one another by age of symptomatic onset, duration, early-onset manifestations such as blindness or seizures, and the forms which lipofuscin accumulation takes.<ref name="no23" />

In the early infantile variant of NCL (also called INCL or Santavuori-Haltia), probands appear normal at birth, but early visual loss leading to complete retinal blindness by the age of 2 years is the first indicator of the disease; by 3 years of age a vegetative state is reached and by 4 years isoelectric encephalograms confirm brain death. Late infantile variant usually manifests between 2 and 4 years of age with seizures and deterioration of vision. The maximum age before death for late infantile variant is 10–12 years.<ref name=no3>{{cite journal |author=Hellstein, E., et al. |title=Human palmitoyl protein thioesterase |journal=Eur Mol Bio Org J |volume=15 |issue=19 |year=1996 |pages=5240–5 |url=}}</ref><ref name=no4>{{cite journal |author=Kim, S., et al. |title=PPT1 deficiency leads to the activation of caspase-9 and contributes to rapid neurodegeneration in INCL |journal=Hum Mol Gen |volume=15 |issue=10 |year=2006 |pages=1586–90 |url=Late Infantile NCL (LINCL or Jansky-Bielschowsky), on the other hand, initially presents as generalized tonic-clonic or myoclonic seizures beginning at around 2-3 years of age; following this is depressed cognitive development including slow learning, speech delays, and eventual dementia leading to death, usually between 14 and 36 years of age.}}</ref><ref name="no5">{{cite journal |author=Ju, W., et al. |title=Identification of CLN2 mutations shows Canadian specific NCL2 alleles |journal=J Med Gen |year=2002 |pages=822–825 |url=|doi=10.1136/jmg.39.11.822 |volume=39 |pmid=12414822 |issue=11 |pmc=1735024}}</ref><ref name=no6>{{cite journal |author=Isosomppi, J., et al. |title=Lysosomal localization of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis CLN5 protein |journal=Hum Mol Gen |volume=11 |issue=8 |year=2002 |pages=885–91 |url=|doi=10.1093/hmg/11.8.885 |pmid=11971870}}</ref> Juvenile NCL (JNCL, Batten Disease, or Spielmeyer-Vogt), with a prevalence of 1 in 100,000, usually arises between 4 and 10 years of age; the first symptoms include considerable vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa, with seizures, psychological degeneration, and eventual death in the mid- to late-20s ensuing.<ref name="no14">{{cite journal |author=Persaud-Sawin, D., et al. |title=Motifs within the CLN3 protein |journal=Hum Mol Gen |volume=11 |issue=18 |year=2002 |pages=2129–2142 |url=|doi=10.1093/hmg/11.18.2129 |pmid=12189165}}</ref> Adult variant NCL (ANCL or Kuf’s Disease) is less understood and generally manifests milder symptoms; however, while symptoms typically appear around 30 years of age, death usually occurs ten years later.<ref name="no17">{{cite book |last=Wisnewsky |first=Krystyna E |coauthor=et al. |title=GeneReviews (NCBI) |chapter=Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses |year=2006 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=gene.chapter.ncl}}</ref>

All the mutations that have been associated with this disease have been linked to genes involved with the neural synapses metabolism – most commonly with the reuse of vesicle proteins.

== History==
===19th century===
The first probable instances of this condition were reported in 1826 in a Norwegian medical journal by Dr. Christian Stengel,<ref name=pmid16908122>{{cite journal |author=Haltia M |title=The neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses: from past to present |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=1762 |issue=10 |pages=850–6 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16908122 |doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2006.06.010 |url=http://www.helsinki.fi/neurosci/Jalanko_Haltia.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|7}}</ref><ref>C.

Nor. Laegeforen. |volume=124 |issue=7 |pages=970–1 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15088608 |doi= |url=}}</ref> who described 4 affected siblings in a small mining community in Norway. Although no pathological studies were performed on these children the clinical descriptions are so succinct that the diagnosis of the [[Spielmeyer-Sjogren]] (juvenile) type is fully justified.

===1900 to 1950===
More fundamental observations were reported by [[Frederick Batten|F. E. Batten]] in 1903,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Batten, F. E. |title=Cerebral degeneration with symmetrical changes in the maculae in two members of a family |journal=Transactions of the Ophthalmological Societies of the United Kingdom |volume=23 |pages=386–90 |year=1902}}</ref> and by [[Heinrich Vogt]] in 1905,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000213427 |author=Vogt, H. |title=Über familiäre amaurotische Idiotie und verwandte Krankheitsbilder |journal=Monatsschrift für Psychiatrie und Neurologie |volume=18 |location=Basel |issue=2 |pages=161–71, 310–57 |year=1905}}</ref> who performed extensive clinicopathological studies on several families. Retrospectively, these papers disclose that the authors grouped together different types of the syndrome. Furthermore Batten, at least for some time, insisted that the condition that he described was distinctly different from [[Tay-Sachs disease]], the prototype of a neuronal [[lysosomal disorder]] now identified as [[GM2 gangliosidosis]] type A. Around the same time, [[Walther Spielmeyer]] reported detailed studies on three siblings,<ref>W. Spielmeyer. Klinische und anatomische Untersuchungen über eine besondere Form von familiärer amaurotische Idiotie. Freiburg im Breisgau, Gotha, 1907. Reprinted in Nissl: Histologische und histopathologische Arbeiten über die Grosshirnrinde 1908, 2: 193-213.</ref> suffering from the Spielmeyer-Sjogren (juvenile) type, which led him to the very firm statement that this malady is not related to [[Tay-Sachs disease]]. Subsequently, however, the pathomorphological studies of [[Károly Schaffer]] made these authors change their minds to the extent that they reclassified their respective observations as variants of Tay-Sachs disease, which caused confusion lasting about 50 years. 

In 1913-14, [[Max Bielschowsky]] delineated the late infantile form of NCL.<ref name=pmid8864279>{{cite journal |author=Goebel HH, Gerhard L, Kominami E, Haltia M |title=Neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis—late-infantile or Jansky-Bielschowsky type--revisited |journal=Brain Pathol. |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=225–8 |year=1996 |month=July |pmid=8864279 |doi= 10.1111/j.1750-3639.1996.tb00850.x|url=}}</ref> However, all forms were still thought to belong in the group of "familial amaurotic idiocies", of which Tay-Sachs was the prototype. 

In 1931, [[Torsten Sjögren]], the Swedish psychiatrist and geneticist, presented 115 cases with extensive clinical and genetic documentation and came to the conclusion that the disease which we now call the Spielmeyer-Sjogren (juvenile) type is genetically separate from Tay-Sachs.<ref>K. G. T. Sjögren. Die juvenile amaurotische Idiotie. 1931.</ref>

===1950 to today===
Departing from the careful morphological observations of Spielmeyer, Hurst, and Sjovall and Ericsson, Zeman and Alpert made a determined effort to document the previously suggested pigmentary nature of the neuronal deposits in certain types of storage disorders.<ref name=pmid14171739>{{cite journal |author=Zeman W, Alpert M |title=On the nature of the "stored" lipid substances in juvenile amaurotic idiocy (Batten-Spielmeyer-Vogt) |journal=Ann Histochim |volume=8 |issue= |pages=255–7 |year=1963 |pmid=14171739 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Simultaneously, Terry and Korey<ref name=pmid13776040>{{cite journal |author=Terry RD, Korey SR |title=Membranous cytoplasmic granules in infantile amaurotic idiocy |journal=Nature |volume=188 |issue= 4755|pages=1000–2 |year=1960 |month=Dec |pmid=13776040 |doi= 10.1038/1881000a0|url=}}</ref> and Svennerholm<ref name=pmid13979552>{{cite journal |author=Svennerholm L |title=The chemical structure of normal human brain and Tay-Sachs gangliosides |journal=Biochem.

Commun. |volume=9 |issue= 5|pages=436–41 |year=1962 |month=November |pmid=13979552 |doi=10.1016/0006-291X(62)90030-X }}</ref> demonstrated a specific ultrastructure and biochemistry for Tay-Sachs disease, and these developments led to the distinct identification and also separation of the NCLs from Tay-Sachs disease by Zeman and Donahue. At that time, it was proposed that the Late Infantile (Jansky-Bielschowsky), the juvenile (Spielmeyer-Vogt), and the adult form (Kufs) were quite different from Tay-Sachs disease with respect to chemical pathology and ultrastructure and also different from other forms of [[sphingolipidoses]]. 

Subsequently, it was shown by Santavuori and Haltia that an infantile form of NCL exists,<ref name=pmid4698309>{{cite journal |author=Santavuori P, Haltia M, Rapola J, Raitta C |title=Infantile type of so-called neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis. 1. A clinical study of 15 patients |journal=J Neurol Sci. |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=257–67 |year=1973 |month=Mar |pmid=4698309 |doi=10.1016/0022-510X(73)90075-0 }}</ref> which Zeman and Dyken had included with the Jansky Bielschowsky type.

== Forms==

The older classification of NCL divided the condition into four types (CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, and CLN4) based upon age of onset, while newer classifications divide it by the associated gene.<ref name="pmid15965709">{{cite journal |author=Mole SE, Williams RE, Goebel HH |title=Correlations between genotype, ultrastructural morphology and clinical phenotype in the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses |journal=Neurogenetics |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=107–26 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=15965709 |doi=10.1007/s10048-005-0218-3}}</ref><ref>{{OMIM|256730}}</ref>

CLN4 (unlike CLN1, CLN2, and CLN3) has not been mapped to a specific gene.

| '''Type''' || '''Description''' || '''[[OMIM]]''' || '''Gene'''
 |- 
 | Type 1 || '''Infantile NCL''' ([[Santavuori-Haltia disease]], INCL): begins between about 6 months and 2 years of age and progresses rapidly. Affected children fail to thrive and have abnormally small heads ([[microcephaly]]). Also typical are short, sharp muscle contractions called myoclonic jerks. Initial signs of this disorder include delayed psychomotor development with progressive deterioration, other motor disorders, or seizures. The infantile form has the most rapid progression and children live into their mid childhood years. The gene responsible for Infantile NCL has been identified in some cases of juvenile/adult onset. It is thought these patients have some partial enzyme production that leads to a protracted, less severe disease course. || {{OMIM2|256730}} || [[PPT1]]

===Mutations===
====Infantile form====
[[nonsense mutation|Nonsense]] and [[frameshift mutation|frameshift]] mutations in the CLN1 gene (located at 
1p32<ref name=no9>NCBI Entrez Gene: PPT1 [''Homo Sapiens''] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=5538&ordinalpos=28&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Gene.Gene_ResultsPanel.Gene_RVDocSum</ref><ref name=no13>{{cite journal |author=Sharp, J., et al. |title=Loci for classical and a variant LINCL map to chromosomes 11p15 and 15q21-23 |journal=Hum Mol Gen |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=1997 |pages=591–5 |url=|doi=10.1093/hmg/6.4.591 |pmid=9097964}}</ref><ref name=no29>{{OMIM|256730|NCL1, CLN1}}</ref>) always induce classical INCL, while some [[missense mutation|misssense mutations]] have been associated with ANCL in addition to the Infantile and Juvenile forms. The mutation typically results in a deficient form of a [[lysosome|lysosomal]] [[enzyme]] called [[palmitoyl protein thioesterase]] 1 (PPT1).<ref name=no1>{{cite journal |author=Lyly, Annina |title=Glycosylation, transport, and complex formation of PPT1 |journal=BMC Cell Biology |year=2007 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/22 |doi=10.1186/1471-2121-8-22 |volume=8 |pages=22 |pmid=17565660 |last2=Von Schantz |first2=C |last3=Salonen |first3=T |last4=Kopra |first4=O |last5=Saarela |first5=J |last6=Jauhiainen |first6=M |last7=Kyttälä |first7=A |last8=Jalanko |first8=A |pmc=1906764}}</ref>

The [[wild type]] PPT1 is a 306 [[amino acid]] [[polypeptide]] that is typically targeted for transport into [[lysosome]]s by the [[mannose 6-phosphate]] (M6P) receptor mediated pathway.<ref name=no3/><ref name=no1/> Here the protein appears to function in removing [[palmitate]] [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]] by cleaving [[thioester]] linkages in s-acylated (or palmitoylated) proteins, encouraging their breakdown.<ref name=no3/><ref name=no4/> Defective [[polypeptides]], however, are unable to exit the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER), most likely due to [[protien folding|misfolding]]; further analyses of this pathway could serve to categorize INCL among lysosomal enzyme deficiencies. It is important to note that the human PPT gene shows 91% similarity to bovine PPT and 85% similarity to rat PPT; these data indicate that the PPT gene is highly conserved and likely plays a vital role in cell metabolism.<ref name=no3/> In addition buildup of defective PPT1 in the ER has been shown to cause the increased release of Ca2+. This [[homeostasis]]-altering event leads to increased [[mitochondrial]] membrane permeability and subsequent activation of [[caspase-9]], eventually leading to an accumulation of cleaved and uncleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and eventual [[apoptosis]].<ref name=no4/>

====Late infantile form====
The CLN2 gene encodes a 46kDa protein called lysosomal [[tripeptidyl peptidase I]] (TPPI) which cleaves tripeptides from terminal [[amine]] groups of partially unfolded proteins.<ref name=no5/><ref name=no20>{{cite journal |title=NCL/Batten disease: the lysosomal proteinoses |journal=Mol Psychiatry |year=2002 |pages=434–6 |url=Two mutations common to this gene are a G to C [[transversion]] and a C to T [[transition (genetics)|transition]], which prematurely terminate [[translation (genetics)|translation]] at [[amino acid]] 208 of 563 (7). The deficiency of this lysosomal [[protease]], then, results in increased [[ATP synthase subunit C|subunit C]] storage.}}</ref><ref name=no20/> Mutations of this gene typically result in a LINCL phenotype.<ref name=no8>{{cite journal |author=Gao, H., et al. |title=Mutations in a novel CLN6-encoded transmembrane cause variant NCL in man and mouse |journal=Am J Hum Genet |year=2002 |pages=324–35 |url=|doi=10.1086/338190 |volume=70 |pmid=11791207 |issue=2 |pmc=384912}}</ref>

====Juvenile form====
All mutations resulting in the Juvenile variant of NCL have been shown to occur at the CLN3 gene on 16p12;<ref name=no13/> of the mutations known to cause JNCL, 85% result from a 1.02 kb deletion, with a loss of amino acids 154-438, while the remaining 15% appear to result from either point or [[frameshift mutation]]s.<ref name=no14/> The wild type CLN3 gene codes for a protein with no known function;<ref name=no12/> however, studies of the yeast CLN3 [[ortholog]], the product of which is called [[Battenin]] (after its apparent connections to Batten’s Disease, or JNCL), have suggested that the protein may play a role in lysosomal [[pH]] [[homeostasis]]. Furthermore, recent studies have also implied the protein’s role in [[cathepsin D]] deficiency; the overexpression of the defective protein appears to have significant effects on [[cathepsin D]] processing, with implications suggesting that accumulation of ATP synthase subunit C would result.<ref name=no16>{{cite journal |author=Fossale, E., et al. |title=Membrane trafficking and mitochondrial abnormalities precede subunit c deposition in a cerebellar cell model of juvenile ceroid lipofuscinosis |journal=BMC Neuroscience |url=http://www.biomedc-entral.com/1471-2202/5/57}}</ref> Only recently have studies of human patients shown deficiency of lysosomal aspartyl proteinase cathepsin D.

====Adult dominant form====

Between 1.3% and 10% of cases are of the adult form. The age at onset is variable (6–62 yr). Two main clinical subtypes have been described: progressive myoclonus epilepsy (type A) and dementia with motor disturbances, such as cerebellar, extrapyramidal signs and dyskinesia (type B). Unlike the other NCLs retinal degeneration is absent. Pathologically the ceroid-lipofuscin accumulates mainly in neurons and contains subunit C of the mitochondrial [[ATP synthase]].

Two independent families have been shown to have mutations in the [[DNAJC5]] gene - one with a [[transvertion]] and the other with a deletion mutation.<ref name=Benitez2011>{{cite journal | author = Benitez BA, Alvarado D, Cai Y, Mayo K, Chakraverty S, Norton J, Morris JC, Sands MS, Goate A ''et al.'' | year = 2011 | title = Exome-sequencing confirms DNAJC5 mutations as cause of Adult Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinosis | url = | journal = PLoS One | volume = 6 | issue = 11| page = e26741 }}</ref> The muations occur in a [[cysteine]]-string domain, which is required for membrane targeting/binding, palmitoylation and oligomerization of the encoded protein cysteine-string protein alpha (CSPα).

==Inheritance==
Childhood NCLs are [[Recessive gene|autosomal recessive]] disorders; that is, they occur only when a child inherits two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent. When both parents carry one defective [[gene]], each of their children faces one in four chance of developing NCL. At the same time, each child also faces a one in two chance of inheriting just one copy of the defective gene. Individuals who have only one defective gene are known as carriers, meaning they do not develop the disease, but they can pass the gene on to their own children.

Adult NCL may be inherited as an [[autosomal recessive]] (Kufs) or, less often, as an [[autosomal dominant]] (Parry's) disorder. In [[autosomal dominant]] [[inheritance]], all people who inherit a single copy of the disease gene develop the disease. As a result, there are no unaffected carriers of the [[gene]].

==Diagnosis==
Because vision loss is often an early sign, Batten disease/NCL may be first suspected during an eye exam. An eye doctor can detect a loss of cells within the eye that occurs in the three childhood forms of Batten disease/NCL. However, because such cell loss occurs in other eye diseases, the disorder cannot be diagnosed by this sign alone. Often an eye specialist or other physician who suspects Batten disease/NCL may refer the child to a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in disease of the brain and nervous system. In order to diagnose Batten disease/NCL, the neurologist needs the patient's medical history and information from various laboratory tests.

Diagnostic tests used for Batten disease/NCLs include: 

*Skin or tissue sampling. The doctor can examine a small piece of tissue under an [[electron microscope]]. The powerful magnification of the microscope helps the doctor spot typical NCL deposits. These deposits are found in many different tissues, including [[skin]], [[muscle]], [[conjunctiva]], [[rectal]] and others. Blood can also be used.{{citation needed|reason=A clinician is unlikely to make use of an electron microscope; the inclusions are often easily seen using light microscopy|date=November 2008}} These deposits take on characteristic shapes, depending on the variant under which they are said to occur: granular osmophilic deposits (GRODs) are generally characteristic of INCL, while [[curvilinear]] profiles, fingerprint profiles, and mixed-type inclusions are typically found in LINCL, JNCL, and ANCL, respectively.
*[[Electroencephalogram]] or EEG. An EEG uses special patches placed on the scalp to record electrical currents inside the brain. This helps doctors see telltale patterns in the brain's electrical activity that suggest a patient has [[seizures]].
*Electrical studies of the eyes. These tests, which include [[visual-evoked response]]s (VER) and [[Electroretinography|electroretinogram]]s (ERG), can detect various eye problems common in childhood Batten disease/NCLs.
*Brain scans. Imaging can help doctors look for changes in the brain's appearance. The most commonly used imaging technique is [[computed tomography]] (CT), which uses x-rays and a computer to create a sophisticated picture of the brain's tissues and structures. A CT scan may reveal brain areas that are decaying in NCL patients. A second imaging technique that is increasingly common is [[magnetic resonance imaging]], or MRI. MRI uses a combination of magnetic fields and radio waves, instead of radiation, to create a picture of the brain.
*Enzyme assay. A recent development in diagnosis of Batten disease/NCL is the use of enzyme assays that look for specific missing [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] [[enzyme]]s for infantile and late infantile only. This is a quick and easy diagnostic test.

== Treatment ==

Currently there is no widely accepted treatment that can cure, slow down, or halt the symptoms of NCL. However, seizures may be controlled or reduced with use of anti-epileptic drugs. Additionally, physical, speech, and occupational therapies may help affected patients retain functioning for as long as possible.

Several experimental treatments are under investigation.

===Cystagon===
In 2001 it was reported a drug used to treat [[cystinosis]], a rare genetic disease that can cause kidney failure if not treated, may be useful in treating the infantile form of NCL. Preliminary results report the drug has completely cleared away storage material from the white blood cells of the first six patients, as well as slowing down the rapid neurodegeneration of infantile NCL. 

It is preliminarily shown that the addition of another drug seems to be more effective than [[Cystagon]] alone and all patients on the trials, including the first six, are being put on this drug. 

Currently there are two drug trials underway for infantile Batten disease/NCL. Both trials are using the drug Cystagon. For additional information regarding this trial, contact the [http://bdsra.org Batten Disease Support and Research Association].

===Gene therapy===
A [[gene therapy]] trial using an adeno-associated virus vector called AAV2CUhCLN2 began in June 2004 in an attempt to treat the manifestations of Late Infantile NCL.<ref name="safety study">{{cite web|title=Safety Study of a Gene Transfer Vector for Children With Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00151216?term=batten+disease&rank=5|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref> The trial was conducted by Weill Medical College of Cornell University<ref name="safety study" /> and sponsored by the Nathan's Battle Foundation.<ref name="urlNathans Battle | Clinical Trial Efforts">{{cite web |url=http://www.nathansbattle.com/scientific/clinical.html |title=Nathan's Battle | Clinical Trial Efforts }}</ref> In May 2008, it was reported that the gene therapy given to the recipients was "safe; and that, on average, it significantly slowed the disease's progression during the 18-month follow-up period"<ref>{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Andrew|title=Gene therapy trial offers new hope for Batten disease, a fatal neurological disease in children|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/May08/wcmc.crystal.batten.html|work=Cornell Chronicle|accessdate=May 30, 2008}}</ref> and "suggested that higher doses and a better delivery system may provide greater benefit".<ref name="safety study Rh.10">{{cite web|title=Safety Study of a Gene Transfer Vector (Rh.10) for Children With Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01161576?term=batten+disease&rank=3|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref>

A second gene therapy trial for Late Infantile NCL using an adeno-associated virus derived from [[rhesus macaque]] (a species of [[Old World monkey]]) called AAVrh.10 began in August 2010 and is once again being conducted by Weill Medical College of Cornell University.<ref name="safety study Rh.10" /> Animal models of Late Infantile NCL showed that the AAVrh.10 delivery system "was much more effective, giving better spread of the gene product and improving survival greatly".<ref name="safety study Rh.10" /> 

A third gene therapy trial, using the same AAVrh.10 delivery system, began in 2011 and been expanded to include Late Infantile NCL patients with moderate/severe impairment or uncommon genotypes and uses a novel administration method that reduces general anesthesia time by 50% in order to minimize potential adverse side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01414985?term=batten+disease&rank=2|title=AAVRh.10 Administered to Children With Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis With Uncommon Genotypes or Moderate/Severe Impairment|accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref>

===Flupirtine===
A painkiller available in several European countries, [[Flupirtine]], has been suggested to possibly slow down the progress of NCL,<ref name=pmid11921051>{{cite journal |author=Dhar S, Bitting RL, Rylova SN, ''et al.'' |title=Flupirtine blocks apoptosis in batten patient lymphoblasts and in human postmitotic CLN3- and CLN2-deficient neurons |journal=Ann Neurol. |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=448–66 |year=2002 |month=Apr |pmid=11921051|doi=10.1002/ana.10143}}</ref> particularly in the juvenile and late infantile forms. No trial has been officially supported in this venue, however. Currently the drug is available to NCL families either from Germany, Duke University Medical Center in [[Durham, North Carolina]], and the Hospital for Sick Children in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]].

===Stem cells===
On October 20, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration approved a phase I clinical trial of neural stem cells to treat infantile and late infantile Batten disease. Subsequent approval from an independent review board also approved the stem cell therapy in early March 2006. This treatment will be the first ever transplant of fetal stem cells performed on humans. The therapy is being developed by Stem Cells Inc and is estimated to have six patients. The treatment will be carried out in Oregon.<ref name="urlStudy of the Safety and Preliminary Effectiveness of Human Central Nervous System (CNS) Stem Cells (HuCNS-SC) in Patients With Infantile or Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov">{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00337636 |title=Study of the Safety and Preliminary Effectiveness of Human Central Nervous System (CNS) Stem Cells (HuCNS-SC) in Patients With Infantile or Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Juvenile NCL has recently been listed on the Federal Clinical Trials website to test the effectiveness of bone marrow/stem cell transplants for this condition. A bone marrow transplant has been attempted in the late infantile form of NCL with disappointing results; while the transplant may have slowed the onset of the disease, the child eventually developed the disease and died in 1998. 

Trials testing the effectiveness of bone marrow transplants for infantile NCL in Finland have also been disappointing, with only a slight slowing of disease reported.<ref name=pmid11673581>{{cite journal |author=Lönnqvist T, Vanhanen SL, Vettenranta K, ''et al.'' |title=Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis |journal=Neurology |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=1411–6 |year=2001 |month=Oct |pmid=11673581 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11673581}}</ref>

===Immunosuppressants===
In late 2007, it was reported by Dr. David Pearce et al. that [[Cellcept]], an [[immunosuppressant]] medication commonly used in [[bone marrow transplant]]s, may be useful in slowing down the progress of Juvenile NCL.<ref name="urlBDSRA - Batten Disease Support and Research Association">{{cite web |url=http://www.bdsra.org/research/Pearce-trial.htm |title=BDSRA - Batten Disease Support and Research Association |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Fundraising is currently underway to gather the funds needed to start a clinical trial to test the safety and efficiency of CellCept for Juvenile NCL.
