'''Sarin''', or '''GB''', is an [[organophosphorus compound]] with the formula [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHO]CH<sub>3</sub>P(O)F. It is a colorless, odorless liquid,<ref name=niosh>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/EmergencyResponseCard_29750001.html Sarin (GB)]. Emergency Response Safety and Health Database. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed April 20, 2009.</ref> used as a [[chemical weapons|chemical weapon]] owing to its extreme potency as a [[nerve agent]]. It has been classified as a [[weapon of mass destruction]] in [[UN Resolution 687]]. Production and stockpiling of sarin was outlawed by the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] of 1993 where it is classified as a [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|Schedule 1 substance]].

==Production and structure==
Sarin is a [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecule]] (typically [[racemic]]), with four [[substituents]] attached to the [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral phosphorus center]].<ref>D. E. C. Corbridge "Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology" 5th Edition Elsevier: Amsterdam 1995. ISBN 0-444-89307-5.</ref> The S<sub>P</sub> form (the R<sub>P</sub> form is shown) is the more active [[enantiomer]] due to its greater binding to [[acetylcholinesterase]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=KOVARIK|first=Zrinka|title=Acetylcholinesterase active centre and gorge conformations analysed by combinatorial mutations and enantiomeric phosphonates|journal=Biochem. J.|year=2003|month=March|volume=373|pages=33–40|doi=10.1042/BJ20021862}}</ref> It is prepared from [[methylphosphonyl difluoride]] and a mixture of [[isopropyl alcohol]].
:CH<sub>3</sub>P(O)F<sub>2</sub> + (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHOH → [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHO]CH<sub>3</sub>P(O)F + HF

[[Isopropylamine]] is added to neutralize the [[hydrogen fluoride]] generated during this [[alcoholysis]] reaction. As a [[binary chemical weapon]], it can be generated [[in situ]] by this same reaction.

==Biological effects==

Its [[mechanism of action]] resembles that of some commonly used [[insecticide]]s, such as [[malathion]]. In terms of biological activity, it resembles [[carbamate]] insecticides such as [[Carbaryl|Sevin]] and [[medicine]]s [[pyridostigmine]], [[neostigmine]], and [[physostigmine]]. Like other nerve agents, sarin attacks the [[nervous system]].

Specifically, sarin is a potent [[Irreversible inhibition|inhibitor]] of the enzyme [[cholinesterase|acetylcholinesterase]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Abu-Qare AW, Abou-Donia MB |title=Sarin: health effects, metabolism, and methods of analysis |journal=Food Chem. Toxicol. |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1327–33 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12387297 |doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(02)00079-0 |url=}}</ref> Sarin acts on cholinesterase by forming a [[covalent bond]] with the particular [[serine]] residue at the active site. Fluoride is the [[leaving group]], and the resulting [[phosphoester]] is robust and biologically inactive.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Millard CB, Kryger G, Ordentlich A, ''et al.'' |title=Crystal structures of aged phosphonylated acetylcholinesterase: nerve agent reaction products at the atomic level |journal=Biochemistry |volume=38 |issue=22 |pages=7032–9 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10353814 |doi=10.1021/bi982678l |url=}}. See {{Proteopedia|1cfj}}.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hörnberg | first1 = Andreas | last2 = Tunemalm | first2 = Anna-Karin | last3 = Ekström | first3 = Fredrik | title = Crystal Structures of Acetylcholinesterase in Complex with Organophosphorus Compounds Suggest that the Acyl Pocket Modulates the Aging Reaction by Precluding the Formation of the Trigonal Bipyramidal Transition State†,‡ | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 46 | issue = 16 | pages = 4815–4825 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17402711 | doi = 10.1021/bi0621361 }}</ref> With the enzyme inhibited, acetylcholine builds up in the [[synapse]] and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are, in effect, continually transmitted. Normally, the acetylcholinesterase breaks down the acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft in order to allow the effector muscle or organ to relax. Death will usually occur as a result of [[asphyxia]] due to the inability of the muscles involved in breathing to function.

==Degradation and shelf life==

[[File:Sarin test rabbit.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rabbit used to check for leaks at sarin production plant, [[Rocky Mountain Arsenal]] (1970)]]

The most important chemical reactions of phosphoryl halides is the [[hydrolysis]] of the bond between phosphorus and the fluoride. This P-F bond is easily broken by nucleophilic agents, such as water and [[hydroxide]]. At high pH, sarin decomposes rapidly to nontoxic [[phosphonic acid]] derivatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/types-of-chemical-agent/nerve-agents/|title=Nerve agents}}</ref><ref>{{Housecroft1st|page=317}}</ref>

Sarin degrades after a period of several weeks to several months. The shelf life can be shortened by impurities in precursor materials. According to the [[CIA]], some Iraqi sarin had a shelf life of only a few weeks, owing mostly to impure precursors.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|date=July 15, 1996|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/gulf/cia/960715/72569.htm|title=Stability of Iraq's Chemical Weapon Stockpile|accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>

Its otherwise short shelf life can be extended by increasing the purity of the precursor and intermediates and incorporating stabilizers such as [[tributylamine]]. In some formulations, tributylamine is replaced by [[diisopropylcarbodiimide]] (DIC), allowing sarin to be stored in [[aluminium]] casings. In [[binary chemical weapon]]s, the two precursors are stored separately in the same [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] and mixed to form the agent immediately before or when the shell is in flight. This approach has the dual benefit of solving the stability issue and increasing the safety of sarin munitions.

==Effects and treatment==
Sarin has a high volatility relative to similar nerve agents. Inhalation and absorption through the skin pose a great threat. Even vapor concentrations immediately penetrate the skin. A person’s clothing can release sarin for about 30 minutes after it has come in contact with sarin vapor, which can lead to exposure of other people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts About Sarin|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/basics/facts.asp}}Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 17 May 2004. Retrieved 23 December 2012.</ref> People who absorb a non-lethal dose but do not receive immediate appropriate medical treatment may suffer permanent neurological damage.

Even at very low concentrations, sarin can be fatal. Death may follow in one minute after direct ingestion of a lethal dose unless [[antidote]]s, typically [[atropine]] and [[pralidoxime]], are  quickly administered.<ref name=niosh /> [[Atropine]], an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] to [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, is given to treat the physiological symptoms of poisoning. Since muscular response to acetylcholine is mediated through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, atropine does not counteract the muscular symptoms. Pralidoxime can regenerate cholinesterases if administered within approximately five hours. [[Biperiden]], a synthetic acetylcholine antagonist, has been suggested as an alternative to atropine due to its better [[blood–brain barrier]] penetration and higher efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shim|first=TM|coauthors=McDonough JH|title=Efficacy of biperiden and atropine as anticonvulsant treatment for organophosphorus nerve agent intoxication.|journal=Archives of Toxicology|year=2000|month=May|volume=74|issue=3|pages=165–172|doi=10.1007/s002040050670}}</ref> 

Sarin is estimated to be over 500 times more toxic than [[cyanide]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Council on Foreign Relations&nbsp;— Sarin|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/9553/|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> The LD<sub>50</sub> of subcutaneously injected sarin in mice is 172 μg/kg.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Inns|first=RH|coauthors=NJ Tuckwell, JE Bright, TC Marrs|title=Histochemical Demonstration of Calcium Accumulation in Muscle Fibres after Experimental Organophosphate Poisoning|journal=Hum Exp Toxicol|year=1990|month=July|volume=9|issue=4|pages=245–250|doi=10.1177/096032719000900407}}</ref> Treatment measures have been described.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/basics/facts.asp|title=Facts About Sarin|accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref>

Initial symptoms following exposure to sarin are a runny nose, tightness in the chest and constriction of the [[pupil]]s. Soon after, the victim has difficulty breathing and experiences nausea and drooling. As the victim continues to lose control of bodily functions, the victim vomits, defecates and urinates. This phase is followed by twitching and jerking. Ultimately, the victim becomes comatose and suffocates in a series of convulsive spasms.

===Diagnostic tests===
Controlled studies in humans have shown that a minimally toxic 0.5&nbsp;mg oral dose caused a 38% depression of both erythrocyte and plasma cholinesterase within several hours of exposure.{{Citation needed | reason=Specific numbers quoted, please provide paper/source.|date=December 2012}}  The serum level of unbound [[isopropylmethylphosphonic acid]] (IMPA), a sarin hydrolysis product, ranged from 2-135&nbsp;µg/L in survivors of a terrorist attack during the first 4 hours post-exposure.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1407-1409.</ref>

==History==
Sarin was discovered in 1938 in [[Wuppertal|Wuppertal-Elberfeld]] in Germany by two German scientists attempting to create stronger pesticides; it is the most toxic of the four [[Nerve agent#G-Series|G-agents]] made by Germany. The compound, which followed the discovery of the [[nerve agent]] [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], was named in honor of its discoverers: [[Gerhard Schrader|Schrader]], Ambros, Rüdiger and Van der Linde.<ref name="Evans2008">{{citation|author=Richard J. Evans|title=The Third Reich at War, 1939-1945|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0XZHSyTLyIMC&pg=PA669|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2008|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-59420-206-3|pages=669–}}</ref>

===Use as a weapon===
In mid-1939, the formula for the agent was passed to the [[chemical warfare]] section of the [[German Army Weapons Office]], which ordered that it be brought into mass production for wartime use. A number of pilot plants were built, and a high-production facility was under construction (but was not finished) by the end of [[World War II]]. Estimates for total sarin production by Nazi Germany range from 500&nbsp;kg to 10&nbsp;tons.<ref>{{cite news

* 1950s (early): [[NATO]] adopted sarin as a standard chemical weapon, and both the USSR and the United States produced sarin for military purposes.
* 1953: 20-year-old [[Ronald Maddison]], a [[Royal Air Force]] engineer from [[Consett]], [[County Durham]], died in human testing of sarin at the [[Porton Down]] chemical warfare testing facility in Wiltshire. Maddison had been told that he was participating in a test to "cure the common cold." Ten days after his death an [[inquest]] was held in secret which returned a verdict of "misadventure". In 2004, the inquest was reopened and, after a 64-day inquest hearing, the jury ruled that Maddison had been unlawfully killed by the "application of a nerve agent in a non-therapeutic experiment."<ref>{{cite news

* 2004: On May 14, [[Iraqi insurgency|Iraqi insurgents]] detonated a 155&nbsp;mm shell containing binary precursors for sarin near a U.S. convoy in [[Iraq]]. The shell was designed to mix the chemicals as it spins during flight. The detonated shell released only a small amount of sarin gas, either because the explosion failed to mix the binary agents properly or because the chemicals inside the shell had degraded with age. Two United States soldiers were treated after displaying the early symptoms of exposure to sarin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4997808/|title=Bomb said to hold deadly sarin gas explodes in Iraq|date=May 17, 2004|accessdate=2007-08-03|publisher=MSNBC}}</ref>
