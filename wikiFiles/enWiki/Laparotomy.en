A '''laparotomy''' is a [[surgery|surgical]] procedure involving a large incision through the [[abdominal]] wall to gain access into the [[abdominal cavity]]. It is also known as '''celiotomy'''.

== Terminology ==
In  diagnostic laparotomy (most often referred to as an [[exploratory laparotomy]] and abbreviated Ex-Lap), the nature of the disease is unknown, and laparotomy is deemed the best way to identify the cause. 

In therapeutic laparotomy, a cause has been identified (e.g. [[peptic ulcer]], [[colon cancer]]) and laparotomy is required for its therapy.                                         

Usually, only exploratory laparotomy is considered a stand-alone surgical operation. When a specific operation is already planned, laparotomy is considered merely the first step of the procedure.

== Spaces accessed ==
Depending on incision placement, laparotomy may give access to any abdominal organ or space, and is the first step in any major diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedure of these organs, which include: 
* the [[digestive tract]] (the [[stomach]], [[duodenum]], [[jejunum]], [[ileum]] and [[colon (anatomy)|colon]])
* the [[liver]], [[pancreas]], [[gallbladder]], and [[spleen]]
* the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]
* the female reproductive organs (the [[uterus]] and [[ovary|ovaries]])
* the [[retroperitoneal|retroperitoneum]] (the [[kidney]]s, the [[aorta]], abdominal [[lymph node]]s)
* the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]]

{{Main|Surgical Incisions}}

=== Midline ===
The most common incision for laparotomy is the '''midline incision''', a vertical incision which follows the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]]. 

* The ''upper midline incision'' usually extends from the [[xiphoid process]] to the [[Navel|umbilicus]].

* A typical ''lower midline incision'' is limited by the umbilicus superiorly and by the [[pubic symphysis]] inferiorly.

* Sometimes a single incision extending from [[xiphoid process]] to pubic symphysis is employed, especially in [[trauma surgery]].

Midline incisions are particularly favoured in diagnostic laparotomy, as they allow wide access to most of the abdominal cavity.

=== Other ===
Other common laparotomy incisions include:
* the '''Kocher (right subcostal) incision''' (after [[Emil Theodor Kocher]]); appropriate for certain operations on the [[liver]], [[gallbladder]] and [[biliary tract]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1010}}</ref><ref name="titleIncisions">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdh-odp.co.uk/incisions.htm |title=Incisions |accessdate=2007-11-22 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071101054358/http://www.pdh-odp.co.uk/incisions.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-01}}</ref> This shares a name with the Kocher incision used for thyroid surgery: a transverse, slightly curved incision about 2&nbsp;cm above the sternoclavicular joints;

* the '''Davis''' or '''Rockey-Davis''' "muscle-splitting" right lower quadrant incision for [[appendectomy]];

* the '''[[Pfannenstiel incision]]''', a transverse incision below the umbilicus and just above the pubic symphysis.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2500}}</ref><ref>H. J. Pfannenstiel.

It is the incision of choice for [[Cesarean section]] and for abdominal [[hysterectomy]] for benign disease.  A variation of this incision is the '''Maylard incision''' in which the [[rectus abdominis]] [[muscle]]s are sectioned transversally to permit wider access to the pelvis.<ref name="pmid11978282">{{cite journal |author=Giacalone PL, Daures JP, Vignal J, Herisson C, Hedon B, Laffargue F |title=Pfannenstiel versus Maylard incision for cesarean delivery: A randomized controlled trial |journal=Obstetrics and gynecology |volume=99 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=745–50 |year=2002 |pmid=11978282|doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(02)01957-9}}</ref>

* '''Lumbotomy''' consists of a [[lumbar]] incision which permits access to the [[kidney]]s (which are [[retroperitoneal]]) without entering the [[peritoneal cavity]]. It is typically used only for benign renal lesions. It has also been proposed for surgery of the upper urological tract.<ref name="pmid15211405">{{cite journal |author=Bajpai M, Kumar A, Gupta AK, Pawar DK |title=Lumbotomy approach for upper urological tract surgery in children--an analysis of 68 consecutive lumbotomies |journal=European Journal of Pediatric Surgery |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=163–7 |year=2004 |pmid=15211405 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-820903}}</ref>

* '''Cherney Incision'''

== Related procedures ==
A related procedure is [[laparoscopy]], where cameras and other instruments are inserted into the [[peritoneal cavity]] via small holes in the abdomen. For example, an [[appendectomy]] can be done either by a laparotomy or by a [[laparoscopic]] approach.
