'''Leptospirosis''' (also known as ''' Weil's syndrome''', '''canicola fever''', '''canefield fever''', '''nanukayami fever''', '''7-day fever''', '''Rat Catcher's Yellows''', '''Fort Bragg fever''', '''black jaundice''', and '''Pretibial fever'''<ref name="Andrews">{{Cite book|author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; ''et al.'' |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |year=2006 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 }}</ref>{{rp|290}}) is caused by [[infection]] with bacteria of the [[genus]] ''[[Leptospira]]'' and affects [[human]]s as well as other animals.

Leptospirosis is among the world's most common [[zoonosis|diseases transmitted to people from animals]]. The infection is commonly transmitted to humans by allowing water that has been contaminated by [[animal urine]] to come in contact with unhealed breaks in the [[human skin|skin]], the [[human eye|eyes]], or with the [[mucous membrane]]s. Outside of [[Tropics|tropical]] areas, leptospirosis cases have a relatively distinct seasonality with most cases occurring in spring and autumn.{{citeneeded|date=October 2011}}

==Causes and transmission==
[[Image:Leptospira scanning micrograph.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Scanning electron micrograph]] of a number of Leptospira sp. bacteria atop a 0.1 µm [[polycarbonate]] filter.]]

Leptospirosis is caused by a [[spirochaete]] bacterium called ''[[Leptospira]]'' spp. There are at least five [[serotype]]s of importance in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], all of which cause disease in dogs (Icterohaemorrhagiae, Canicola, Pomona, Grippotyphosa, and Bratislava).<ref name="Langston 2003">{{Cite journal|author=Langston CE, Heuter KJ |title=Leptospirosis.

There are other (less common) infectious strains. Genetically different leptospira organisms may be identical serologically and vice versa. Hence, an argument exists on the basis of strain identification. The traditional serologic system is seemingly more useful from a diagnostic and epidemiologic standpoint at the moment (which may change with further development and spread of technologies like [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR)).

Leptospirosis is transmitted by the urine of an infected animal and is contagious as long as it is still moist. Although rats, mice, and moles are important primary hosts, a wide range of other mammals including dogs, deer, rabbits, hedgehogs, cows, sheep, raccoons, opossums, skunks, and certain marine mammals are able to carry and transmit the disease as secondary hosts. Dogs may lick the urine of an infected animal off the grass or [[soil]] or drink from an infected puddle. 

There have been reports of "house dogs" contracting leptospirosis apparently from licking the urine of infected mice that entered the house. The type of habitats most likely to carry infective bacteria are muddy riverbanks, ditches, gullies, and muddy livestock rearing areas where there is regular passage of either wild or farm mammals. There is a direct correlation between the amount of rainfall and the incidence of leptospirosis, making it seasonal in temperate climates and year-round in tropical climates.

Leptospirosis is also transmitted by the semen of infected animals.<ref name="lept">{{Cite journal| author=Kiktenko VS| title=Leptospirosis infection through insemination of animals| journal=J Hyg Epidemiol Microbiol Immunol.| year=1976| volume=21| issue=2| pages=207–213 | pmid=987112 | last2=Balashov | first2=NG | last3=Rodina | first3=VN}}</ref> 

Humans become infected through contact with water, food, or soil containing urine from these infected animals. This may happen by swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin contact. The disease is not known to be spread from person to person and cases of bacterial dissemination in convalescence are extremely rare in humans. Leptospirosis is common among water-sport enthusiasts in specific areas as prolonged immersion in water is known to promote the entry of the bacteria. Surfers and whitewater paddlers<ref name="Kayaking as a risk factor for leptospirosis. Shaw RD.">{{cite journal |author=Shaw RD |title=Kayaking as a risk factor for leptospirosis |journal=Mo Med |volume=89 |issue=6 |pages=354–7 |year=1992 |month=June |pmid=1620089 }}</ref> are at especially high risk in areas that have been shown to contain the bacteria, and can contract the disease by swallowing [[contaminated water]], splashing contaminated water into their eyes or nose, or exposing open wounds to infected water.<ref name="Surfing Sicknesses">[http://surf.transworld.net/2009/01/27/seven-surf-sicknesses/ transworld.net: Seven Surfing Sicknesses].</ref> 

=== At risk occupations ===

Occupations at risk include [[veterinarian]]s, slaughterhouse workers, farmers, sewer maintenance workers, waste disposal facility workers, land surveyors and people working on derelict buildings.<ref>{{cite web | title = Weils Disease at Work | url = http://www.injury-compensation-zone.co.uk/compensation-for-weils-disease-work/}}</ref> [[Slaughterhouse]] workers may contract the disease through contact with infected blood or body fluids. Rowers are also sometimes known to contract the disease.<ref name="Langston 2003"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Leptospiral infection in humans causes a range of [[symptom]]s, and some infected persons may have no symptoms at all. Leptospirosis is a [[biphasic disease]] that begins with [[flu-like symptoms]] (fever, chills, [[myalgia]]s, intense headache). The first phase resolves, and the patient is briefly asymptomatic until the second phase begins. This is characterized by meningitis, liver damage (causing jaundice), and renal failure. The infection is often [[misdiagnosis|wrongly diagnosed]] due to the wide range of symptoms. This leads to a lower registered number of cases than exists. 

Symptoms of leptospirosis include high [[fever]], severe [[headache]], chills, muscle aches, and [[vomiting]], and may include [[jaundice]], [[Conjunctival suffusion|red eyes]], [[abdominal pain]], [[diarrhea]], and [[rash]]. Initial presentation may resemble pneumonia. The symptoms in humans appear after a 4–14 day incubation period.  More severe manifestations include [[meningitis]], extreme [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[hearing loss]], respiratory distress, [[azotemia]], and renal interstitial tubular necrosis, which results in [[renal failure]] and occasionally [[liver failure]] (the severe form of this disease is known as '''Weil's disease''', though it is sometimes named '''Weil Syndrome''').<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23871 Weil syndrome definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Cardiovascular]] problems are also possible.

The [[incubation period]] (time of exposure to first [[symptom]]s) in animals is anywhere from 2 to 20 days. In dogs the liver and kidney are most commonly damaged by leptospirosis. In addition, there are recent reports of a pulmonary form of canine leptospirosis associated with severe hemorrhage in the lungs similar to the human pulmonary hemorrhagic syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klopfleisch R, Kohn B, Plog S, Weingart C, Nöckler K, Mayer-Scholl A, Gruber AD. |title=An Emerging Pulmonary Haemorrhagic Syndrome in Dogs: Similar to the Human Leptospiral Pulmonary Haemorrhagic Syndrome? |journal=Vet Med Int. |year=2011 |volume=33 |pmid=21274452 |pages=928541 |doi=10.4061/2010/928541 |pmc=3025382}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Kohn B, Steinicke K, Arndt G, Gruber AD, Guerra B, Jansen A, Kaser-Hotz B, Klopfleisch R, Lotz F, Luge E, Nöckler K.|title=Pulmonary abnormalities in dogs with leptospirosis |journal=J Vet Intern Med. |year=2010 |volume=24 |pmid=20738768 |pages=791–807 |doi=10.1111/j.1939-1676.2010.0585.x|issue=6}}</ref> [[Vasculitis]] may occur, causing [[edema]] and potentially [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC). [[Myocarditis]], [[pericarditis]], [[meningitis]], and [[uveitis]] are also possible sequelae.<ref name="Langston 2003"/> 

One should strongly suspect leptospirosis and include it as part of a [[differential diagnosis]] if the sclerae of the dog's eyes appear [[jaundice]]d (even slightly yellow). The absence of jaundice does not eliminate the possibility of leptospirosis, and its presence could indicate [[hepatitis]] or other liver pathology rather than leptospirosis. Vomiting, fever, failure to eat, reduced urine output, unusually dark or brown urine, and [[lethargy]] are also indications of the disease.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Leptospirosis in kidney.jpg|thumb|250px|Kidney tissue, using a [[silver stain]]ing technique, revealing the presence of ''Leptospira'' bacteria.]]
On infection the [[microorganism]] can be found in [[blood]] and CSF for the first 7 to 10 days (invoking serologically identifiable reactions) and then moving to the kidneys. After 7 to 10 days the microorganism can be found in fresh urine. Hence, early diagnostic efforts include testing a serum or blood sample serologically with a panel of different strains. 

Kidney function tests ([[blood urea nitrogen]] and [[creatinine]]) as well as blood tests for liver functions are performed. The latter reveal a moderate elevation of transaminases. Brief elevations of [[aspartate aminotransferase]] (AST), [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT), and [[gamma-glutamyltransferase]] (GGT) levels are relatively mild. These levels may be normal, even in children with jaundice. 

[[medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] of leptospirosis is confirmed with tests such as [[ELISA|enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA) and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). The MAT (microscopic agglutination test), a serological test, is considered the [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] in diagnosing leptospirosis. As a large panel of different leptospira need to be subcultured frequently, which is both laborious and expensive, it is underused, mainly in developing countries.

[[Differential diagnosis]] list for leptospirosis is very large due to diverse symptomatics. For forms with middle to high severity, the list includes [[dengue fever]] and other hemorrhagic [[fever]]s, [[hepatitis]] of various [[etiology|etiologies]], viral [[meningitis]], [[malaria]], and [[typhoid fever]]. Light forms should be distinguished from [[influenza]] and other related viral diseases. Specific tests are a must for proper diagnosis of leptospirosis. 

Under circumstances of limited access (e.g., developing countries) to specific diagnostic means, close attention must be paid to the [[Anamnesis (medicine)|medical history]] of the patient. Factors such as certain dwelling areas, seasonality, contact with [[stagnant water|stagnant]] contaminated water (bathing, swimming, working on flooded meadows, etc.) or rodents in the medical history support the leptospirosis hypothesis and serve as indications for specific tests (if available).

Leptospira can be cultured in [[Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris medium]], which is incubated at 28 to 30&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Gellan gum as a substitute for agar in leptospiral media |author=Rule PL, Alexander AD |journal=J Clin Microbiol |issue=3 |pages=500–504 |year=1986 |pmid=3754265 |volume=23 |pmc=268682}}</ref> The median time to positivity is three weeks with a maximum of three months. This makes culture techniques useless for diagnostic purposes, but is commonly used in research.

==Treatment==
[[Doxycycline]] may be used as a [[prophylaxis]] 200–250&nbsp;mg once a week, to prevent infection in high risk areas.<ref name="Pavli A, Maltezou HC 2008 447–53">{{Cite journal|author=Pavli A, Maltezou HC |title=Travel-acquired leptospirosis |journal=J Travel Med |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=447–53 |year=2008 |pmid=19090801 |doi=10.1111/j.1708-8305.2008.00257.x |url=}}</ref> Treatment is a relatively complicated process comprising two main components: suppressing the causative agent and fighting possible complications. Effective [[antibiotics]] include [[cefotaxime]], doxycycline, [[penicillin]], [[ampicillin]], and [[amoxicillin]].  Human therapeutic dosage of drugs is as follows: doxycycline 100&nbsp;mg orally every 12 hours for 1 week or penicillin 1–1.5 MU every 4 hours for 1 week. In dogs, penicillin is most commonly used to end the leptospiremic phase (infection of the blood), and doxycycline is used to eliminate the [[asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] state.

Supportive therapy measures (especially in severe cases) include [[detoxification]] and normalization of the [[Electrolyte#Physiological importance|hydro-electrolytic balance]]. Glucose and salt solution infusions may be administered; [[dialysis]] is used in serious cases. Elevations of serum potassium are common and if the potassium level gets too high special measures must be taken. Serum phosphorus levels may likewise increase to unacceptable levels due to renal failure. 

Treatment for hyperphosphatemia consists of treating the underlying disease, dialysis where appropriate, or oral administration of [[calcium carbonate]], but not without first checking the serum calcium levels (these two levels are related). [[Corticosteroid]]s administration in gradually reduced doses (e.g., [[prednisolone]] starting from 30–60&nbsp;mg) during 7–10 days is recommended by some{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} specialists in cases of severe haemorrhagic effects. Organ specific care and treatment are essential in cases of renal, liver, or heart involvement.

==History==
The disease was first described by [[Adolf Weil (physician)|Adolf Weil]] in 1886 when he reported an "acute infectious disease with [[splenomegaly|enlargement of spleen]], [[jaundice]], and [[nephritis]]." ''Leptospira'' was first observed in 1907 from a [[post mortem]] [[kidney|renal tissue]] slice.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Stimson | first1 = AM | year = 1907 | title = Note on an organism found in yellow-fever tissue | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 22 | page = 541 }}</ref> In 1908, Inada and Ito first identified it as the causative organism<ref>{{cite journal |author=Inada R, Ito Y |title=A report of the discovery of the causal organism (a new species of spirocheta) of Weil's disease |journal=Tokyo Ijishinshi |volume=1915 |pages=351–60 |year=1908 }}</ref> and in 1916 noted its presence in rats.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Inanda R, Ido Y, Hoke R, Kaneko R, Ito H |title=The Etiology, Mode of Infection and Specific Therapy of Weil's Disease |journal=J Exper Med |volume=23 |page=377 |year=1916 |doi=10.1084/jem.23.3.377 |issue=3 }}</ref>

Leptospirosis was postulated as the cause of an [[List of epidemics|epidemic]] among [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] along the coast of present-day [[Massachusetts]] that occurred immediately before the arrival of the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] in 1620 and killed most of the native population.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marr JS, Cathey JT |title=New hypothesis for cause of an epidemic among Native Americans, New England, 1616–1619 |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume=16 |issue=2 |date=February 2010 |doi=10.3201/edi1602.090276 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/2/281.htm}}</ref> Earlier proposals included [[plague (disease)|plague]], [[yellow fever]], [[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[chickenpox]], [[typhus]], [[typhoid fever]], [[trichinellosis]], [[meningitis]], and [[syndemic]] infection of [[hepatitis B virus]] with the [[delta agent]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Webster N |title=A brief history of epidemic and pestilential diseases |publisher=[[Hudson and Goodwin]] |location=Hartford CT |year=1799 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uen8dansteEC}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Williams H |title=The epidemic of the Indians of New England, 1616–1620, with remarks on Native American infections |journal=John Hopkins Hospital Bulletin |volume=20 |pages=340–9 |year=1909 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bratton TL |title=The identity of the New England Indian epidemic of 1616–19 |journal=Bull Hist Med |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=351–83 |year=1988 |pmid=3067787 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Speiss A, Speiss BD |title=New England pandemic of 1616–1622. cause and archeological implication |journal=Man in the Northeast |volume=34 |pages=71–83 |year=1987 }}</ref> The disease may have been brought to the [[New World]] by Europeans and spread by the high-risk daily activities of the Native Americans.

Before Weil's characterization in 1886, the disease known as infectious jaundice was very likely the same as Weil's disease, or severe icteric leptospirosis. During the Egyptian campaign, Napoleon's army suffered from what was probably infectious jaundice.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Edward Rhodes Stitt |author2=Richard Pearson Strong |title=Stitt's Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of tropical diseases |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uqU0AAAAIAAJ |year=1944 |publisher=Blakiston |location=York, PA |edition=7th}}</ref> Infectious jaundice occurred among troops during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Neill M |title=The problem of acute infectious jaundice in the United States |journal=Public Health Rep |volume=33 |pages=717–26 |year=1918 }}</ref> 

It was also reported among troops at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] and other battles of [[World War I]], where the sodden conditions of [[trench warfare]] favored infection. Terms used in early 20th century descriptions of leptospirosis include the pseudo-dengue of Java, seven-day fever, autumn fever, Akiyama disease, and marsh or swamp fever. ''L icterohaemorrhagiae'' was identified as the causative agent in pre-[[World War II]] outbreaks in Japan, which were characterized by jaundice and a high mortality rate.
