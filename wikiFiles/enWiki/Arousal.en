{{distinguish|sexual arousal}}

'''Arousal''' is a [[physiology|physiological]] and [[psychology|psychological]] state of being awake or reactive to stimuli.  It involves the activation of the [[reticular activating system]] in the [[brain stem]], the [[autonomic nervous system]] and the [[endocrine system]], leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure and a condition of sensory alertness, mobility and readiness to respond.

There are many different neural systems involved in what is collectively known as the arousal system.  Four major systems originating in the brainstem, with connections extending throughout the cortex, are based on the brain's neurotransmitters, [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]].  When these systems are in action, the receiving neural areas become sensitive and responsive to incoming signals.

==Importance==
{{Mental state}}
Arousal is important in regulating [[consciousness]], attention, and information processing.  It is crucial for [[motivation|motivating]] certain behaviours, such as mobility, the pursuit of nutrition, the [[fight-or-flight response]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] (see [[Masters and Johnson|Masters and Johnson's]] [[human sexual response cycle]], where it is known as the ''arousal phase'').  It is also very important in [[emotion]], and has been included as a part of many influential theories such as the [[James-Lange theory of emotion]].  According to [[Hans Eysenck]], differences in baseline arousal level lead people to be either [[extrovert]]s or [[introvert]]s. Later research suggest it is most likely that extroverts and introverts have different ''arousability''. Their baseline arousal level is the same, but the response to stimulation is different.<ref>Randy J. Larsen, David M Buss; "Personality psychology, domains of knowledge about human nature", McGraw Hill, 2008</ref>

The [[Yerkes-Dodson law|Yerkes-Dodson Law]] states that there is a relationship between arousal and task performance, essentially arguing that there is an optimal level of arousal for performance, and too little or too much arousal can adversely affect task performance.  One interpretation of the Yerkes-Dodson Law is the Easterbrook Cue-Utilisation hypothesis.  Easterbrook states that an increase of arousal leads to a decrease in number of cues that can be utilised.<ref>Easterbrooke, J.A. (1959). The effect of emotion on cue utilization and the organization of behavior. ''Psychological Review'', ''66'', 187-201</ref> 

In [[positive psychology]], arousal is described as a response to a difficult challenge for which the subject has moderate skills.<ref name="Finding Flow">[[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi, M.]], ''Finding Flow,'' 1997</ref>

=== Introversion and extraversion ===

[[Hans Eysenck]]'s theory of arousal describes the different natural frequency or arousal states of the brains of people who are [[introvert]]ed versus people who are [[extrovert]]ed. The theory states that the brains of extroverts are naturally less stimulated, so these types have a predisposition to seek out situations and partake in behaviors that will stimulate arousal.<ref name="First">{{cite journal|last=Lashley|first=K|title=Basic Neural Mechanisms in Behavior|journal=The Psychological Review|year=1930|month=January|volume=37|issue=1|pages=1–24|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> Therefore introverts are naturally over-stimulated, so they avoid intense arousal whereas extroverts are naturally under-stimulated, so actively engage in arousing situations. Campbell and Hawley (1982) studied the differences in introverts versus extroverts responses to particular work environments in the library.<ref name="First"/> The study found that introverts were more likely to choose quiet areas with minimal to no noise or people. Extroverts were more likely to choose areas with much activity with more noise and people.<ref name=First /> Daoussiss and McKelvie's (1986) research showed that introverts performed worse on memory tasks when they were in the presence of music compared to silence. Extroverts were less affected by the presence of music.<ref name=First /> Similarly, Belojevic, Slepcevic and Jokovljevic (2001) found that introverts had more concentration problems and fatigue in their mental processing when work was coupled with external noise or distracting factors.<ref name=First /> The level of arousal surrounding the individuals greatly affected their ability to perform tasks and behaviors, with the introverts being more affected than the extroverts, because of each's naturally high and low levels of stimulation, respectively.

=== Emotional stability vs. introversion-extraversion ===

[[Neuroticism]] or emotional instability and extraversion are two factors of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five Personality Index]]. These two dimensions of personality describe how a person deals with anxiety-provoking or emotional stimuli as well as how a person behaves and responds to relevant and irrelevant external stimuli in their environment. Neurotics experience tense arousal which is characterized by tension and nervousness. Extraverts experience high energetic arousal which is characterized by vigor and energy.<ref name="Third">{{cite journal|last=Zajenkowski|first=Marcin|coauthors=Gorynska, Winiewski|title=Variability of the relationship between personality and mood|journal=Elsevier|date=5|year=2012|month=January|volume=52|series=Personality and Individual Differences|pages=858–861|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> Gray (1981) claimed that extraverts have a higher sensitivity to reward signals than to punishment in comparison to introverts. Reward signals aim to raise the energy levels.<ref name=Third /> Therefore extraverts typically have a higher energetic arousal because of their greater response to rewards.

=== The four personality types ===

Hans Eysenck theorized that there are four personality types: [[choleric]], [[melancholic]], [[sanguine]], and [[phlegmatic]], each embodying either high or low levels of two dimensions: [[neuroticism]] and extraversion. 
[[File:EysenckPersonalityTypes.gif|thumbnail|right|Eysenck's 4 Personality Types]]
Choleric people are high in neuroticism and high in extraversion. The choleric react immediately, and the arousal is strong, lasting, and can easily create new excitement about similar situations, ideas, or impressions.<ref name=Book /> Melancholic people are high in neuroticism and low in extraversion (or more introverted). The melancholic are slow to react and it takes time for an impression to be made upon them if any is made at all. However, when aroused by something, melancholics have a deeper and longer lasting reaction, especially when exposed to similar experiences.<ref name=Book /> Sanguine people are low in neuroticism (or more emotionally stable) and high in extraversion. The sanguine are quickly aroused and excited, like the cholerics, but unlike the cholerics, their arousal is shallow, superficial, and shortly leaves them as quickly as it developed.<ref name=Book>{{cite book|last=Hock|first=Conrad|title=The Four Temperaments|year=1934|publisher=Catholic Apostolate Press|location=Milwaukee, WI|isbn=978-1453823941|url=http://sedevacantist.com/misc/temperaments.html}}</ref> Phlegmatic people are low in neuroticism and low in extraversion. The phlegmatic are slower to react and the arousal is fleeting.<ref name=Book />

The contrasts in the different temperaments come from individuals variations in a person's brain stem, limbic system, and thalamocortical arousal system. These changes are observed [[Electroencephalogram]] or EEG recordings which monitor brain activity.<ref name="Fourth">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=David|title=How brain arousal systems determine di􏰂erent temperament types and the major dimensions of personality|journal=Elsevier|date=6|year=2000|month=November|volume=31|series=Personality and Individual Differences|pages=1233–1259|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> [[Limbic system]] activation is typically linked to neuroticism, which high activation showing high neuroticism, which is known to impair learning. Cortical arousal is associated with introversion-extraversion differences, with high arousal indicating introversion, which is known to facilitate learning. Both the limbic system and the thalamocortical arousal system are influenced by the brain stem activation.<ref name=Fifth>{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=David|coauthors=Gabriel, Katchan|title=Personality and Second Language Learning|journal=Personality Individual Differences|date=22|year=1993|month=February|volume=16|issue=1|pages=143–157|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> Robinson's study (1982) concluded that melancholic types had the greatest [[natural frequencies]], or a "predominance of excitation," meaning that melancholics (who are characterized by introversion) have a higher internal level of arousal.<ref name=Fourth /> Sanguine people (or those with high extraversion and low neuroticism) had the lowest overall levels of internal arousal, or a "predominance of inhibition.<ref name=Fourth />" Melancholics also had the highest overall thalamocortical excitation, whereas cholerics (those with high extraversion and high neuroticism) had the lowest intrinsic thalamocortical excitation.<ref name=Fourth /> The differences in the internal system levels is the evidence that Eysenck used to explain the differences between the introverted and the extroverted. [[Pavlov]], the founder of classical conditioning, also partook in temperament studies with animals. Pavlov's findings with animals are consistent with Eysenck's conclusions. In his studies, melancholics produced an inhibitory response to all external stimuli, which holds true that melancholics shut out outside arousal, because they are deeply internally aroused.<ref name=Fourth /> Pavlov found that cholerics responded to stimuli with aggression and excitement whereas melancholics became depressed and unresponsive.<ref name=Fourth /> The high neuroticism, characterized by both melancholics and cholerics both manifested themselves differently because of the different levels of internal arousal both types had.

== Arousal and emotion ==

=== Cannon-Bard theory ===

The [[Cannon-Bard theory|Cannon-Bard Theory]] is a theory of undifferentiated arousal, where the physical and emotional states occur at the same time in response to an event. This theory states that an emotionally provoking event results in both the physiological arousal and the emotion occurring concurrently.<ref name=Tenth>{{cite web|title=Cannon-Bard Theory of Emotion|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/cannon_bard_emotion.htm|work=ChangingMinds.org|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> For example, a dear family member dies. A potential physiological response would be tears falling down your face and your throat feeling dry. You are "sad." The Cannon-Bard theory states that the tears and the sadness both happen at the same time. The process goes: event (family member dies) --> physiological arousal (tears) AND emotion (sadness) simultaneously.<ref name="Tenth"/>

=== James-Lange theory ===

The [[James-Lange theory|James-Lange Theory]] describes how emotion is caused by the bodily changes which come from the perception of the emotionally arousing experience or environment.<ref name=Sixth /> This theory states that events cause the autonomic nervous system to induce physiological arousal, characterized by muscular tension, heart rate increases, perspiration, dryness of mouth, tears, etc.<ref name=Ninth>{{cite web|title=James-Lange Theory of Emotion|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/james_lange_emotion.htm|work=ChangingMinds.org|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> According to James and Lange, the emotion comes as a result of the physiological arousa<ref name=Eighth /> l. The bodily feeling as a reaction to the situation IS the emotion.<ref name=Sixth /> For example, someone just deeply insulted you and your family. Your fists ball up, you begin to perspire, and you are tense all around. You feel that your fists are balled and that you are tense. You then realize that you are angry. The process here is: event (insult) --> physiological arousal (balled fists, sweat, tension) --> interpretation (I have balled fists, and tension) --> emotion (anger: I am angry).<ref name=Eighth /> This type of theory emphasizes the physiological arousal as the key, in that the cognitive processes alone would not be sufficient evidence of an emotion.

=== Schachter-Singer two-factor theory ===

The [[Two-factor theory of emotion|Schachter-Singer Two-Factor Theory]] or the cognitive labeling theory takes into account both the physiological arousal and the cognitive processes that respond to an emotion provoking situation. Schachter and Singer's theory states that an emotional state is the product of the physiological arousal and the cognition appropriate state of arousal. Meaning, that cognition determines how the physical response is labeled, either as "anger," "joy," "fear," etc.<ref name=Sixth>{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=Stanley|coauthors=Singer|title=Cognitive, Social, and Physiological Determinants of Emotional State|journal=Psychological Review|year=1962|month=September|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> Emotion is a product of the interaction between the state of arousal as well as how one's thought processes appraise the current situation.<ref name=Seventh>{{cite web|title=Schacter and Singer's study of emotion|url=http://learning.covcollege.ac.uk/content/NLN/Health_Care,_Medicine,_Health_And_Safety/Psychology/act_PK1_Schacter_and_Singers_study_of_emotion/FD2427DE-89F1-4E3E-9CB0-2E0FA376BEE0/s05two_factor_theory/010a_twofactors.htm|work=Becta Psychology|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> The physiological arousal, however, does not label the emotion, but the cognitive label does. For example, let's say you are being pursued by a serial killer. You will be sweating and your heart will be racing, which is your physiological state. Your cognitive label will come from accessing your quickly beating heart and sweat as "fear." Then you will feel the emotion of "fear," but only after it has been established through cognition. The process is: the event (serial killer chasing you) --> physiological arousal (sweat, heart racing) --> cognitive label (reasoning; this is fear) --> emotion (fear).<ref name=Eighth>{{cite web|title=Two-Factor Theory of Emotion|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/two-factor_emotion.htm|work=ChangingMinds.org|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>

== Arousal and memory ==
Arousal is involved in the detection, retention, and retrieval of information in the [[memory]] process.  Emotionally arousing information can lead to better memory encoding, therefore influencing better retention and retrieval of information.  Arousal is related to [[selective attention]] during the encoding process by showing that people are more subject to encode arousing information than neutral information.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sharot|first=T|coauthors=Phelps, E.|title=How arousal modulates memory: Disentangling the effects of attention and retention|journal=Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience|year=2004|volume=4|issue=3|pages=294–306}}</ref>    The selectivity of encoding arousing stimuli produces better [[long-term memory]] results than the encoding of neutral stimuli.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mickley Steinmetz|first=K|coauthors=Schmidt, K., Zucker, H., & Kensinger, E.|title=The effect of emotional arousal and retention delay on subsequent-memory effects|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2012|volume=3|issue=4|pages=150–159}}</ref>   In other words, the retention and accumulation of information is strengthened when exposed to arousing events or information.  Arousing information is also retrieved or remembered more vividly and accurately.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jeong|first=E|coauthors=Biocca, F.|title=Corrigendum to "Are there optimal levels of arousal to memory? effects of arousal, centrality, and familiarity on brand memory in video games"|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=285–291}}</ref>
<br />
Although arousal improves memory under most circumstances, there are some considerations.  Arousal at learning is associated more with long-term recall and retrieval of information than short-term recall of information.  For example, one study found that people could remember arousing words better after one week of learning them than merely two minutes after learning them.<ref name="Revelle">{{cite web|last=Revelle|first=W|title=The implications of arousal effects for the study of affect and memory|url=http://pmc.psych.northwestern.edu/revelle/publications/rl91/rev_loft.arousal.html}}</ref>   Another study found that arousal affects the memory of people in different ways.  [[Hans Eysenck]] found an association between memory and the arousal of introverts versus extroverts.  Higher levels of arousal increased the amount of words retrieved by extroverts and decreased the amount of words retrieved by introverts.<ref name="Revelle"/>

== Arousal and preference ==
A person’s level of arousal when introduced to stimuli can be indicative of his or her preferences. One study found that familiar stimuli are often preferred to unfamiliar stimuli.  The findings suggested that the exposure to unfamiliar stimuli was correlated to avoidance behaviors.  The unfamiliar stimuli may lead to increased arousal and increased avoidance behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramsoy|first=T|coauthors=Friis-Olivarius, M., Jacobsen, C., & Jensen, S.|title=Effects of perceptual uncertainty on arousal and preference across different visual domains|journal=Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics|year=2012|volume=5|issue=4|pages=212–226}}</ref> 
<br />
On the contrary, increased arousal can increase approach behaviors as well. People are said to make decisions based on their emotional states.  They choose specific options that lead to more favorable emotional states.<ref name="Suri">{{cite journal|last=Suri|first=G|coauthors=Sheppes, G., & Gross, J.|title=Predicting affective choice|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|year=2012}}</ref>   When a person is aroused, he or she may find a wider range of events appealing<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ariely|first=D|coauthors=Loewenstein, G.|title=The heat of the moment: The effect of sexual arousal on sexual decision making.|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|year=2006|volume=19|issue=2|pages=87–98}}</ref>   and view decisions as more salient, specifically influencing [[approach-avoidance conflict]].<ref name="Suri"/>  The state of arousal might lead a person to view a decision more positively than he or she would have in a less aroused state.
<br />
The reversal theory accounts for the preference of either high or low arousal in different situations.  Both forms of arousal can be pleasant or unpleasant, depending on a person’s moods and goals at a specific time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walters|first=J.|coauthors=Apter, M., & Svebak, S.|title=Color preference, arousal, and the theory of psychological reversals|journal=Motivation and Emotion|year=1982|volume=6|issue=13|pages=193–215}}</ref>   Wundt’s hedonic curve and Berlyne’s hedonic curve differ slightly from this theory.  Both theorists explain a person’s arousal potential in terms of his or her hedonic tone.  These individual differences in arousal demonstrate [[Eysenck]]’s theory that extroverts prefer increased stimulation and arousal, whereas introverts prefer lower stimulation and arousal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Revelle|first=W.|title=Arousal Theories|url=http://personality-project.org/revelle/syllabi/205/arousaltheories.pdf}}</ref>

== Problems associated with arousal ==
Arousal is associated with both [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].
<br />
Depression can influence a person’s level of arousal by interfering with the right hemisphere’s functioning.  Arousal in women has been shown to be slowed in the left visual field due to depression, indicating the influence of the right hemisphere.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Liotti|first=M.|coauthors=Tucker, D.|title=Right hemisphere sensitivity to arousal and depression|journal=Brain and Cognition|year=1992|volume=18|issue=2|pages=138–151}}</ref> 
	<br />
Arousal and anxiety have a different relationship than arousal and depression.  People who suffer from anxiety disorders tend to have abnormal and amplified perceptions of arousal.  The distorted perceptions of arousal then create fear and distorted perceptions of the self.  For example, a person may believe that he or she will get sick from being so nervous about taking an exam.  The fear of the arousal of nervousness and how people will perceive this arousal will then contribute to levels of anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thibodeau|first=M.|coauthors=Gómez-Pérez, L., & Asmundson, G.|title=Objective and perceived arousal during performance of tasks with elements of social threat: The influence of anxiety sensitivity|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|year=2012|volume=43|issue=3|pages=967–974}}</ref>

==Abnormally increased behavioral arousal==
This is a state caused by withdrawal from [[alcohol]] or [[barbiturates]], acute [[encephalitis]], [[head trauma]] resulting in [[coma]], partial [[seizures]] in [[epilepsy]], [[metabolic disorders]] of [[electrolyte]] imbalance, Intra-cranial space- occupying lesions, Alzheimer's disease, rabies, hemispheric lesions in stroke and multiple sclerosis.<ref name= "Mirr">Mirr, Michelne Pheifer. "Abnormally Increased Behavioral Arousal" Cris Stewart- Amidei and Joyce A. Kunkel.  Neuroscience Nursing: Human Response to Neurologic Dysfunction. W. B. Sunders Philadelphia: PA, 2001</ref>

Anatomically this is a disorder of the [[limbic system]], [[hypothalamus]], [[temporal lobes]], [[amygdala]] and [[frontal lobes]].<ref name= "Mirr" /> It is not to be confused with [[mania]].
