'''Richter's transformation''', or '''Richter's syndrome''' (RS) is a complication of B cell [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL) in which the leukemia changes into a fast-growing [[diffuse large B cell lymphoma]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms: R|url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?expand=R|work=National Cancer Institute|publisher=NIH|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref>  There is also a less common variant in which the CLL changes into a [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].  Richter's transformation affects about 5% of CLL patients at some point during their lives.<ref name="pmid19206112">{{cite journal |author=Rossi D, Gaidano G |title=Richter syndrome: molecular insights and clinical perspectives |journal=Hematol Oncol |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19206112 |doi=10.1002/hon.880 |url=}}</ref>

==Presentation==
Symptoms of Richter’s transformation in a CLL patient include fever (without infection), an elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase, and rapidly enlarging lymph nodes.<ref name=RSinCLL />  While about 8% of all CLL patients will have elevated levels of serum [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH), more than 50% of CLL patients with Richter's transformation will have elevated LDH levels.

Richter's can appear suddenly, even in patients who were in remission.  

==Treatment==
Treatment with conventional immunochemotherapy is usually indicated; in younger patients, [[allogeneic bone marrow transplantation]] may be curative.<ref name="pmid19206112" />

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is generally poor.  The ''RS score'' (Richter syndrome score), which is an estimate of the patient's prognosis, is based on the patient's [[performance status]], LDH, platelet count, the size of the lymphoma tumors, and the number of prior therapies already received.<ref name="pmid19206112" />  Overall, the median survival is between five to eight months.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Swords|first=R|coauthors=Bruzzi, J; Giles, F|title=Recent advances in the diagnosis and therapy of Richter's syndrome.|journal=Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)|year=2007|volume=24|issue=1|pages=17–32|pmid=17673808|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref>  Untreated, RS is invariably fatal.

The Hodgkin's lymphoma variant of Richter's carries a better prognosis than the predominant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma type, but a worse prognosis than a de novo case of Hodgkin's.

==Etiology==
A case of RS may have arisen by one of two different routes:  a transformation of the CLL cells into lymphoma, or the appearance of an unrelated lymphoma.<ref name="pmid19206112" />  

It is thought that genetic defects may introduce the additional abnormalities necessary to transform CLL cells into Richter's syndrome cells.<ref name=RSinCLL>{{cite journal|last=Tsimberidou|first=Apostolia-Maria|coauthors=Keating, Michael J.; Wierda, William G.|title=Richter’s transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia|journal=Current Hematologic Malignancy Reports|year=2007|month=October|volume=2|issue=4|pages=265–271|doi=10.1007/s11899-007-0036-9|pmid=20425379|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> 

==Epidemiology==
In the United States, about 500 patients are diagnosed with Richter's transformation each year.<ref name=RSinCLL />
