The '''Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices''' (ACIP) provides advice and guidance on effective control of [[vaccine]]-preventable [[disease]]s in the U.S. civilian population. The ACIP develops written recommendations for routine administration of [[vaccine]]s to the pediatric and adult populations, along with [[vaccination schedule]]s regarding appropriate periodicity, dosage, and [[contraindication]]s.  ACIP statements are official federal recommendations for the use of vaccines and immune globulins in the U.S., and are published by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].

==Purpose and impact==

The overall goals of the ACIP are to provide advice to government agencies for reducing the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases and to increase the safe usage of vaccines and related biological products. In the U.S., [[immunization]]s have resulted in the eradication of [[smallpox]], [[polio]], [[measles]], and [[rubella]], and disease rates from vaccine-preventable diseases have been reduced by 99%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vacc-timeline.htm |date=2006-10-19 |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title= Vaccine timeline |publisher= National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080224051837/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vacc-timeline.htm| archivedate= 24 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Both private insurers in the United States and the federal government use ACIP recommendations to determine which vaccines they will pay for.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=138474107|title=Rising Costs Complicate Vaccine Guidelines|accessdate=2011-08-20|date=2011-07-20}}</ref>

Most states in the U.S. have adopted ACIP vaccine recommendations and [[:wikt:mandate|mandate]] immunization before enrollment in public school,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2005 |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=1428â€“31 |title= Responding to parental refusals of immunization of children |author= Diekema DS, American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-0316 |pmid=15867060 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/5/1428}}</ref> while allowing religious or philosophical exemptions to vaccination.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-17-19819928_x.htm |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2007-11-24 |author= LeBlanc S |title= Parents use religion to avoid vaccines |work= USA Today}}</ref>

==Recommendation process==

Regularly scheduled ACIP meetings are held three times a year.  Notices of each meeting, along with agenda items, are published in the [[Federal Register]] in accordance with the requirements of the [[Federal Advisory Committee Act]] (FACA).  A vote on vaccine recommendations may be taken when a quorum of at least eight eligible ACIP members are present.  Eligible voters are those members who do not have a [[conflict of interest]].  If there are not eight eligible voting members present, the ACIP executive secretary can temporarily designate ex officio members as voting members, as provided in the committee charter.<ref name=charter/>

Their process includes review of labeling and package inserts; review of the scientific literature on the safety and [[efficacy]]; assessment of cost effectiveness; review of the [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] associated with the disease; review of the recommendations of other groups; and consideration of the feasibility of vaccine use in existing programs.

At meetings the ACIP may vote to include new vaccines into the VFC program or to modify existing vaccine schedules. These votes are codified as VFC resolutions. In most cases, a resolution takes effect after establishing a CDC contract for the purchase of that vaccine in the necessary amounts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/acip-vfc-resolutions.htm |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title= The ACIP-VFC vaccine resolutions |publisher= National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080108083643/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/acip-vfc-resolutions.htm#about| archivedate= 8 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Working groups===

To ensure thorough review of available information, ACIP often appoints working groups to assist drafting its recommendations, composed of ACIP members, CDC staff and others with immunization expertise.

==Members==

The ACIP nominally contains fifteen regular members, each an expert in one of the following fields:<ref name=charter>{{cite web |title= ACIP charter |date=2007-12-10 |accessdate=2008-01-31 |url=http://cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/ACIP/charter.htm |publisher= National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080115193833/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/charter.htm| archivedate= 15 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
*immunization practices and public health
*use of vaccines and other immunobiologic agents in clinical practice or preventive medicine
*clinical or laboratory vaccine research
*assessment of vaccine efficacy and safety
*consumer perspectives and/or social and community aspects of immunization programs; at least one member must be an expert in this category.

In addition, the ACIP includes ex-officio members from Federal agencies involved with vaccine issues, and non-voting liaison representatives from medical and professional societies and organizations.<ref>{{cite web |title= ACIP members |date=2007-01-07 |accessdate=2008-01-31 |url=http://cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/ACIP/members.htm |publisher= National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080130054547/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/members.htm| archivedate= 30 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
