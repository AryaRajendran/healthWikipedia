'''Agenesis of the corpus callosum''' ('''ACC''') is a rare birth defect ([[congenital disorder]]) in which there is a complete or partial absence of the [[corpus callosum]]. It occurs when the corpus callosum, the band of white matter connecting the two [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres]] in the [[brain]], fails to develop normally, typically during pregnancy. The development of the fibers that would otherwise form the corpus callosum become longitudinally oriented within each hemisphere and form structures called [[Probst bundle]]s.

In addition to agenesis of the corpus callosum, other callosal disorders include hypogenesis (partial formation), [[dysgenesis (embryology)|dysgenesis]] (malformation) of the corpus callosum, and [[hypoplasia]] (underdevelopment) of the corpus callosum.<ref name="maine">{{cite web |url=http://www.umaine.edu/edhd/research/acc/what-is-agenesis-of-the-corpus-callosum-acc/ |publisher=University of Maine |title=ACC - What is agenesis of the corpus callosum? |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Callosal disorders can be diagnosed only through a brain scan.<ref name="nodocc">{{cite web| url=https://www.nodcc.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=27 |title=Corpus callosum disorders |publisher=National Organization for Disorders of the Corpus Callosum |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> They may be diagnosed through an [[MRI]], [[CT scan]], [[Obstetric ultrasonography|prenatal ultrasound]], or prenatal MRI.<ref name="maine"/>

==Cause==
Agenesis of the corpus callosum is caused by disruption to development of the fetal brain between the 3rd and 12th weeks of pregnancy.<ref name="nodocc"/> In most cases, it is not possible to know what caused an individual to have ACC or another callosal disorder. However, research suggests that some possible causes may include chromosome errors, inherited genetic factors, prenatal infections or injuries, prenatal toxic exposures, structural blockage by cysts or other brain abnormalities, and metabolic disorders.<ref name="maine"/>  

===Relation to other rare disorders: genetic ciliopathy===
Until recently, the medical literature did not indicate a connection among many [[genetic disorder]]s, both [[Syndrome|genetic syndromes]] and [[Disease|genetic diseases]], that are now being found to be related. As a result of new genetic research, some of these are, in fact, highly related in their [[genotype|root cause]] despite the widely varying [[phenotype|symptoms]] apparent on clinical examination. Agenesis of the corpus callosum is one such disease, part of an emerging class of diseases called [[ciliopathy|ciliopathies]]. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary [[cilia]] structures of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] [[organelle]]s that are present in many cellular types throughout the [[human]] body. The cilia defects adversely affect "numerous critical developmental signaling pathways" essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often [[pleiotropic|multi-symptom]] nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases. Known ciliopathies include [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]], [[polycystic kidney disease|polycystic kidney]] and [[polycystic liver disease|liver disease]], [[nephronophthisis]], [[Alstrom syndrome]], [[Meckel-Gruber syndrome]], and some forms of [[retinopathy|retinal degeneration]].<ref>{{Cite journal |author= Badano JL, Mitsuma N, Beales PL, Katsanis N |title= The Ciliopathies: An Emerging Class of Human Genetic Disorders |journal= Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics |volume=7 |issue= |pages=125â€“148 |year=2006 |pmid=16722803 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115610 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115610 |postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref>

Signs and symptoms of ACC and other callosal disorders vary greatly among individuals. However, some characteristics common in individuals with callosal disorders include vision impairments, low muscle tone ([[hypotonia]]), poor [[motor coordination]], delays in motor milestones such as sitting and walking, low perception of pain, delayed toilet training, and chewing and swallowing difficulties. Laboratory research has demonstrated that individuals with ACC have difficulty transferring more complex information from one hemisphere to the other.<ref name="TRI">{{cite web |url=http://www.travisinstitute.org/neuroscience/agenesis.htm |title=Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum |publisher=Travis Research Institute |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref>  They also have been shown to have some cognitive disabilities (difficulty in complex problem solving) and social difficulties (missing subtle social cues), even when their intelligence quotient is normal.<ref name="TRI"/> Recent research suggests that specific social difficulties may be a result of impaired [[face perception|face processing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emotion.caltech.edu/agcc/ |title=Corpus Callosum Research Program |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=April 11, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100410052232/http://emotion.caltech.edu/agcc/| archivedate= 10 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The unusual social behavior in childhood is often mistaken for or misdiagnosed as [[Asperger syndrome]] or other [[autism spectrum disorder]]s. Other characteristics sometimes associated with callosal disorders include [[seizures]], [[spasticity]], early feeding difficulties and/or gastric reflux, hearing impairments, abnormal head and facial features, and a mental handicap.<ref name="maine"/>

==Associated syndromes and conditions==
Some syndromes that frequently include ACC are [[Aicardi syndrome]], [[Andermann syndrome]], [[Shapiro syndrome]], [[acrocallosal syndrome]], [[septo-optic dysplasia]] ([[optic nerve hypoplasia]]), [[Mowat-Wilson syndrome]] and [[Menkes syndrome]]. Some conditions that are sometimes associated with ACC include [[Maternal nutrition|maternal nutritional deficiencies]] or [[infection]]s, [[metabolic disorder]]s, [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], [[Craniofacial abnormality|craniofacial abnormalities]], and other [[oral and maxillofacial pathology|oral and maxillofacial pathologies]].<ref name="maine"/>

==Treatment==
There are currently no specific medical treatments for callosal disorders, but individuals with ACC and other callosal disorders may benefit from a range of developmental therapies, educational support, and services. It is important to consult with a variety of medical, health, educational, and social work professionals. Such professionals include [[neurologists]], [[neuropsychology|neuropsychologists]], [[occupational therapists]], [[Physical therapy|physical therapists]], [[Speech and language pathology|speech and language pathologists]], [[Pediatrics|pediatricians]], [[Music_therapist|music therapists]], [[geneticist]]s, [[Special education|special educators]], [[Early childhood intervention|early childhood intervention specialists]], and [[caregiver]]s for adults.<ref name="maine"/>

==Prognosis==
[[Prognosis]] varies depending on the type of callosal abnormality and associated conditions or syndromes. It is not possible for the corpus callosum to regenerate (i.e., the corpus callosum will not regrow).<ref name="nodocc"/> Neuropsychological testing reveals subtle differences in higher cortical function compared to individuals of the same age and education without ACC,
although some individuals with callosal disorders have average intelligence and lead normal lives.

==Notable cases==
[[Kim Peek]], inspiration for the film ''[[Rain Man]]'' and renowned for his [[Autistic savant|savant]] abilities, was born with agenesis of the corpus callosum, along with [[macrocephaly]] and damage to the [[cerebellum]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Martin GN, Carlson NR, Buckist W |year=2007 |title=Psychology |edition=3rd |location=London |publisher=Pearson Education Company}}</ref>
