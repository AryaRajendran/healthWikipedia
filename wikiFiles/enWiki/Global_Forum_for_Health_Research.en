The '''Global Forum for Health Research''' is an international foundation headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] established in 1997 to increase the amount of research into global health issues. It coined the phrase [[10/90 gap]] to identify the observation that only 10% of the world's health research spending is targeted at 90% of present health problems.<ref name="capdevila" />

The Global Forum is a partner to the [[World Health Organisation (WHO)]].<ref name="who">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/research_policy/en/|title=Research Policy|publisher=World Health Organisation|accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref> In her keynote address to the Forum in 1999 [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], then Director&ndash;General of WHO, declared that the Global Forum was key in the involvement of all the various levels, sectors and disciplines of "development agencies, the research community, health workers and end&ndash;users".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/1999/english/19990609_geneva_global_forum.html|title=Dr. G.H.
