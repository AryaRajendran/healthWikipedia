'''Respiratory failure''' (also known as '''hypoxia''') is inadequate [[gas exchange]] by the [[respiratory system]], with the result that levels of arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide or both cannot be maintained within their normal ranges. A drop in blood [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] is known as [[hypoxemia]]; a rise in arterial [[carbon dioxide]] levels is called [[hypercapnia]]. The normal reference values are: oxygen [[Partial pressure|Pa]][[Oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] greater than {{convert|80|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}}, and carbon dioxide Pa[[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] less than {{convert|45|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}}.  Classification into type I or type II relates to the absence or presence of hypercapnia respectively.

==Types==

===Type 1===
Type 1 respiratory failure is defined as [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] without [[hypercapnia]], and indeed the P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> may be normal or low. It is typically caused by a ventilation/perfusion ([[V/Q]]) mismatch; the volume of air flowing in and out of the lungs is not matched with the flow of blood to the lungs. The basic defect in type 1 respiratory failure is failure of oxygenation characterized by:

:::{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || low (< {{convert|60|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> || normal or low (<{{convert|50|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P<sub>A-a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || increased
|}

This type of respiratory failure is caused by conditions that affect oxygenation such as:
* Parenchymal disease ([[V/Q]] mismatch)
* Diseases of vasculature and shunts: [[right-to-left shunt]], [[pulmonary embolism]]
* Interstitial lung diseases: [[Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome|ARDS]], [[pneumonia]], [[emphysema]].

===Type 2===
The basic defect in type 2 respiratory failure is characterized by:

:::{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || decreased (< {{convert|60|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> || increased (> {{convert|50|mmHg|kPa|abbr=on}})
|-
| P<sub>A-a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || normal
|-
|pH || decreased
|}

Type 2 respiratory failure is caused by inadequate ventilation; both oxygen and carbon dioxide are affected.  Defined as the build up of carbon dioxide levels (P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) that has been generated by the body. The underlying causes include:
* Increased airways resistance ([[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[asthma]], suffocation)
* Reduced breathing effort (drug effects, brain stem lesion, extreme obesity)
* A decrease in the area of the lung available for gas exchange (such as in [[chronic bronchitis]]).
* Neuromuscular problems (GB syndrome.,<ref name="Burt 475–479">{{cite journal|last=Burt|first=Christiana C.|coauthors=Arrowsmith, Joseph E.|title=Respiratory failure|journal=Surgery (Oxford)|date=1 November 2009|volume=27|issue=11|pages=475–479|doi=10.1016/j.mpsur.2009.09.007}}</ref> myasthenia gravis, motor neurone disease)

==Treatment==
[[Image:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|right|Mechanical Ventilator]]
Emergency treatment follows the principles of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]. Treatment of the underlying cause is required. [[Endotracheal intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]] in severe respiratory failure ( PaO2 less than 50 mmHg ) required. [[Respiratory stimulant]]s such as [[doxapram]] may be used, and if the respiratory failure resulted from an [[overdose]] of [[sedative]] drugs such as [[opioid]]s or [[benzodiazepines]], then the appropriate [[antidote]] such as [[naloxone]] or [[flumazenil]] will be given.
