'''''Race Against Time: Searching for Hope in AIDS-Ravaged Africa''''' is a non-fiction book written by [[Stephen Lewis]] for the [[Massey Lectures]]. Lewis wrote it in early to mid-2005 and [[House of Anansi Press]] released it as the lecture series began in October 2005. Each of the book's chapters was delivered as one lecture in a different Canadian city, beginning in Vancouver on October 18 and ending in Toronto on October 28. The speeches were aired on [[CBC Radio One]] between November 7 and 11. The author and orator, Stephen Lewis, was the then-[[United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa]] and former [[Canadian ambassadors to the United Nations|Canadian ambassador to the United Nations]]. Although he wrote the book and lectures in his role as a concerned Canadian citizen, his criticism of the [[United Nations]] (UN), international organizations, and other diplomats, including naming specific people, was called undiplomatic and led several reviewers to speculate whether he would be removed from his UN position. 

In the book and the lectures, Lewis argues that significant changes are required to meet the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by [[international financial institutions]] that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the [[structural adjustment]] loans, with [[Conditionality|conditions]] of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|spread of AIDS]] and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by [[G8]] countries to levels beyond what they promise.

Book reviewers found the criticisms constructive and the writing sincere. His style focuses less on numbers and statistics, and more on connecting decisions by UN officials and western diplomats to consequences on the ground in Africa. His eyewitness accounts are said to be candid and emotional. The book spent seven weeks at #1 on ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'''s Nonfiction Bestseller List. A second edition was released in June 2006. The Canadian Booksellers Association awarded its Libris Award for non-fiction book of the year to ''Race Against Time'' and its Author of the Year Award to Lewis in 2006.

==Background==
At the time of publication, the author, [[Stephen Lewis]], aged 67 and living in Toronto, worked as the [[United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa]], a position he held since 2001.<ref name=Valpy>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Valpy |authorlink= Michael Valpy |title=Stephen Lewis: An Envoy on the Brink of No Return |work=The Globe and Mail |date=October 22, 2005 |page=F4}}</ref> Previously he worked as the Deputy Director of [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (1994–99), as the [[Canadian ambassadors to the United Nations|Canadian ambassador to the UN]] (1984–88), and as leader of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] (1970–79). After Lewis optimistically accepted the Special Envoy position he became increasingly distraught by the devastation he witnessed. Already a skilled orator, he became more vocal on the topic. He founded the Stephen Lewis Foundation, hosted [[Oprah Winfrey]] as she toured Africa, and was the subject of two award-winning documentaries by ''[[The Nature of Things]]'', entitled ''Race Against Time'' and ''The Value of Life''.<ref>"[http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/show_raceagainsttime.html Race Against Time]".

He wrote the text in early to mid- 2005 and delivered the lecture series in October when the book was released. Lewis wrote the book, not as an employee of the UN, but as a citizen concerned with the world's response to the AIDS challenge in Africa.<ref name=LaFraniere/>

The book consists of five chapters, from which the five lectures were derived: Context, Pandemic, Education, Women, and Solutions.<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Lewis |title=Race Against Time: Searching for Hope in AIDS-Ravaged Africa |edition=2nd |format= |series=[[Massey Lectures]] |year=2005 |month=October |publisher=[[House of Anansi Press]] |location=Toronto |isbn=0-88784-733-1}}</ref> Before these chapters are sections titled Preface and Acknowledgments, and afterwards a Glossary section. The book's second edition contains an Afterword section written in May 2006. In the Preface, written by Lewis in August 2005, he states that his preferred genre is the spoken word and that the nature of the topic would not allow him to comprehensively cover every aspect. He justifies his writing by proclaiming himself a devotee to the United Nations and outlines the roles he has held with the organization since 1984. In the first chapter, Lewis tells anecdotes of visits to Africa and other UN-related events like, in 1986, brokering the resolutions from the General Assembly's 13th Special Session. He acknowledges colonialism and Cold War ideologues as historical influences on the African situation, but focuses on the effects of [[Global financial system|international finance institutions']] [[Conditionality|conditional loans]] since the late 1980s.<ref>Lewis, 1–36.</ref>

In the second chapter Lewis discusses his history in Africa, beginning in the 1960s as an English teacher in [[Ghana]]. He contrasts Africa of the 1960s shedding colonial rule, optimistic in future prospects, with Africa of the 2000s struggling with AIDS and increasingly widespread hunger.<ref>Lewis, 37–70.</ref> He acknowledges the [[brain drain]] trend, noting "there are more [[Malawian]] doctors in [[Manchester]] [England] than in Malawi".<ref>Lewis, 48.</ref> In the third chapter Lewis examines how the UN, [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) failed to fulfill promises of free access to [[primary education]]. In the instances where school entry fees were eliminated, additional fees (''e.g.'' fees for uniforms, books, exams, and registration) had the same effect of limiting access.<ref>Lewis, 71–108.</ref> The fourth chapter elaborates on how women's issues are ignored or dismissed at international conferences and by African governments. Lewis identifies the gender discrimination that occurs even within the UN organization, whose management staff was dominated by males. He links the World Bank and IMF conditions of low social spending on education and healthcare by governments of recipient countries to the rampant spread of AIDS in those same countries.<ref>Lewis, 109–144.</ref> The disease decimated Africa's working age and farming population, leading to famine. He calls on the international financial institutions to pay "[[Reparation (legal)|reparations]]" in the form of [[debt relief]].<ref>Lewis, 106.</ref><ref name=Hamdan>{{cite journal |last =Hamdan |first=Amani |title = Book Reviews: Race Against Time |journal = International Journal on World Peace |volume=24 |issue=2 |location =New York |issn = 0742-3640 |pages = 116–119 |date = June 2007}}</ref><!---International Journal on World Peace article recaps the content, chapter-by-chapter--->

Lewis concludes that dramatic changes are required to meet the [[Millennium Development Goals]] by 2015. In the final chapter, he considers some potential measures that could help in Africa. He laments the shortfalls in funding by [[G8]] countries, despite the continued renewed promises for full funding of Millennium Development Goal implementation. His proposed measures include:
# the expansion of the [[Jubilee 2000|Jubilee Coalition]] to include cancellation of [[agricultural subsidies]];
# the amalgamation of [[United Nations Development Fund for Women|UN Development Fund for Women]], the UN Division for the Advancement of Women, and relevant portions of [[United Nations Population Fund]] into one UN agency funded to a similar level as UNICEF;
# maintenance of the momentum on the [[World Health Organization]]'s 'three by five' (3&nbsp;million people treated by 2005) program;
# addressing revenue shortfall in [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] through donations from private sector organizations that profit from Africa (''e.g.'' [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]]);
# creating an agency that can provide emergency food aid in a much shorter timeframe than current programs;
# supporting [[Jeffrey Sachs]]' [[Millennium Village Project]];
# investing in vaccine and [[microbicide]] research;
# eliminating school fees for primary education;
# using [[microcredit]] money pots for women to care for orphans;
# planning for capacity replacement on a country-by-country, sector-by-sector basis.<ref>Lewis, 145–190.</ref>

An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', in October 2005, reported on the book's criticism of South Africa government, singling out President [[Thabo Mbeki]] and Health Minister [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]]. Lewis claimed that the South African programs were half-hearted and confusing; a spokesperson for the Health Ministry characterized Lewis as a biased and uninformed judge of South Africa's situation, and countered that they are rapidly expanding treatment programs.<ref name=LaFraniere>{{cite news |first=Sharon |last=LaFraniere |title=U.N.
