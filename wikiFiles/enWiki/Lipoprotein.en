A '''lipoprotein''' is a [[biochemistry|biochemical]] assembly that contains both [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s, bound to the proteins, which allow fats to move through the water inside and outside cells. The proteins serve to emulsify the lipid (otherwise called fat) molecules. Many [[enzyme]]s, [[Membrane transport protein|transporter]]s, structural proteins, [[antigen]]s, [[adhesin]]s, and [[toxin]]s are lipoproteins. Examples include the '''plasma lipoprotein particles''' classified under [[High-density lipoprotein|high-density]] (HDL) and [[Low-density lipoprotein|low-density]] (LDL) lipoproteins, which enable fats to be carried in the [[blood]] stream, the [[transmembrane protein]]s of the [[mitochondrion]] and the [[chloroplast]], and bacterial lipoproteins.<ref>[http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/genomes/dolop/ mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk]</ref>

==Scope==

===Transmembrane lipoproteins===
The lipids are often an essential part of the complex, even if they seem to have no catalytic activity by themselves. To isolate transmembrane lipoproteins from their associated [[Biological membrane|membranes]], [[detergent]]s are often needed.

=== plasma lipoprotein particles ===

The scope of lipoprotein particles is to transport triacylglycerols and cholesterol in the blood between the all the tissues of the body. The most outstanding once being the liver, the [[adipocyte]]s of the [[adipose tissue]]. Particles are created in the intestinum tenue and the liver, but interestingly not in the [[adipocyte]]s.

All [[cell (biology)|cell]]s use and rely on [[fat]]s and [[cholesterol]] as building-blocks to create the multiple [[cell membrane|membrane]]s that cells use both to control internal water content and internal water-soluble elements and to organize their internal structure and protein enzymatic systems.

The lipoprotein particles have [[hydrophilic]] groups of phospholipids, cholesterol, and apoproteins directed outward. Such characteristics make them soluble in the salt water-based blood pool. Triglyceride-fats and cholesterol esters are carried internally, shielded from the water by the phospholipid monolayer and the [[Apolipoprotein|apoprotein]]s.

The interaction of the proteins forming the surface of the particles (a) with enzymes in the blood, (b) with each other, and (c) with specific proteins on the surfaces of cells determine whether triglycerides and cholesterol will be added to or removed from the lipoprotein transport particles.

Regarding [[atheroma]] development and progression as opposed to regression, the key issue has always been cholesterol transport patterns, not cholesterol concentration itself.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}





==Function==
The handling of lipoprotein particles in the body is referred to as ''lipoprotein particle metabolism''. It is divided into two pathways, exogenous and endogenous, depending in large part on whether the lipoprotein partciles in question are composed chiefly of dietary (exogenous) lipids or whether they originated in the liver (endogenous), through [[de novo synthesis]] of triacylglycerols.

The [[hepatocyte]]s are the main platform for the handling of TGs and cholesterol; the liver can also store certain amounts of glycogen and triacylglycerols. Intriguingly [[adipocyte]]s, though being the main storage cells for triacylglycerols, do not produce and kind of lipoprotein particle.

===Exogenous pathway===
[[Bile]] emulsifies fats contained in the chyme, then [[pancreatic lipase]] cleaves molecules into fatty acids, and monoglycerols. [[Enterocyte]]s readily absorb this molecules from the [[chymus]]. Inside of the enterocytes, fatty acids and monoglycerides are transformed again into triacylglycerols. Then these lipids (i.e. [[triacylglycerol]]s, [[phospholipid]]s, [[cholesterol]], and [[cholesteryl ester]]s) are assembled with [[apolipoprotein B-48]] into ''nascent [[chylomicron]]s''. These particles are then secreted into the [[lacteal]]s in a process that depends heavily on apolipoprotein B-48. As they circulate through the lymphatic vessels, nascent chylomicrons bypass the liver circulation and are drained via the [[thoracic duct]] into the bloodstream.

In the blood stream, ''nascent cholomicron particles'' bump with HDL particles; as a result, HDL particles donate [[apolipoprotein C-II]] and [[apolipoprotein E]] to the nascent chylomicron; the chylomicron is now considered mature. Via apolipoprotein C-II, mature chylomicrons activate [[lipoprotein lipase]] (LPL), an enzyme on [[endothelial cell]]s lining the blood vessels. LPL catalyzes the [[hydrolysis]] of [[triacylglycerol]] (i.e., [[glycerol]] covalently joined to three [[fatty acids]]) that ultimately releases [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s from the chylomicrons. Glycerol and fatty acids can then be absorbed in peripheral tissues, especially [[adipose]] and [[muscle]], for energy and storage.

The hydrolyzed chylomicrons are now called ''chylomicron remnants''. The chylomicron remnants continue circulating the bloodstream until they interact via apolipoprotein E with [[chylomicron remnant receptor]]s, found chiefly in the liver. This interaction causes the [[endocytosis]] of the chylomicron remnants, which are subsequently hydrolyzed within [[lysosome]]s. Lysosomal hydrolysis releases glycerol and fatty acids into the cell, which can be used for energy or stored for later use.

===Endogenous pathway===
The [[liver]] is the central platform for the handling of lipds: it is able to store glycerols and fatts in its cells, the hepatocytes. Hepatocytes are also able to create triacylglycerols via de novo synthesis. And the also produce the bile from cholesterol.

In the [[hepatocyte]]s, triacylglycerols, cholesterol cholesteryl esters are assembled with [[apolipoprotein B-100]] to form ''nascent VLDL particles''. Nascent VLDL particles are released into the bloodstream via a process that depends upon apolipoprotein B-100.

In the blood stream, ''nascent VLDL particles'' bump with HDL particles; as a result, HDL particles donate [[apolipoprotein C-II]] and [[apolipoprotein E]] to the nascent VLDL particle; Once loaded with apolipoproteins C-II and E, the nascent VLDL particle is considered mature.

Again like chylomicrons, VLDL particles circulate and encounter LPL expressed on endothelial cells. Apolipoprotein C-II activates LPL, causing hydrolysis of the VLDL particle and the release of glycerol and fatty acids. These products can be absorbed from the blood by peripheral tissues, principally adipose and muscle. The hydrolyzed VLDL particles are now called ''VLDL remnants'' or [[intermediate-density lipoprotein]]s (IDLs). VLDL remnants can circulate and, via an interaction between apolipoprotein E and the remnant receptor, be absorbed by the liver, or they can be further hydrolyzed by [[hepatic lipase]].

Hydrolysis by hepatic lipase releases glycerol and fatty acids, leaving behind ''IDL remnants'', called [[low-density lipoprotein]]s (LDL), which contain a relatively high cholesterol content ( <ref>Kumar V, Butcher SJ, Öörni K, Engelhardt P, Heikkonen J, et al. (2011) Three-Dimensional cryoEM Reconstruction of Native LDL Particles to 16Å Resolution at Physiological Body Temperature.

{{YouTube|id=CtFwss81GBk|title=see native LDL structure at 37°C}}). LDL circulates and is absorbed by the liver and peripheral cells. Binding of LDL to its target tissue occurs through an interaction between the [[LDL receptor]] and apolipoprotein B-100 on the LDL particle. Absorption occurs through [[endocytosis]], and the internalized LDL particles are hydrolyzed within lysosomes, releasing lipids, chiefly cholesterol.

==Classification==
===By density===
Lipoproteins may be classified as follows, listed from larger and less dense to smaller and denser. Lipoproteins are larger and less dense when the fat to protein ratio is increased. They are classified on the basis of [[electrophoresis]] and [[ultracentrifugation]].
* [[Chylomicron]]s carry [[triglycerides]] (fat) from the [[intestine]]s to the [[liver]], to [[skeletal muscle]], and to [[adipose tissue]].
* [[Very-low-density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL) carry (newly synthesised) [[triglycerides]] from the liver to adipose tissue.
* [[Intermediate-density lipoprotein]]s (IDL) are intermediate between VLDL and LDL. They are not usually detectable in the blood.
* [[Low-density lipoprotein]]s (LDL) carry cholesterol from the liver to cells of the body. LDLs are sometimes referred to as the "bad cholesterol" lipoprotein.
** large buoyant LDL (lb LDL) particles
** small dense LDL (sd LDL) particles
** [[Lipoprotein(a)]] is a lipoprotein particle of a certain phenotype
* [[High-density lipoprotein]]s (HDL) collect cholesterol from the body's tissues, and take it back to the liver. HDLs are sometimes referred to as the "good cholesterol" lipoprotein.

===Alpha and beta===
It is also possible to classify lipoproteins as "alpha" and "beta", according to the classification of proteins in [[serum protein electrophoresis]]. This terminology is sometimes used in describing lipid disorders such as [[Abetalipoproteinemia]].

== Studies ==
[[Atherosclerosis]] is the number one mortality cause in the western hemisphere, and since the 1980s, a lot of studies have been conducted to look for ''correlations'' between the incidence of the disease and plasma lipoprotein particle concentrations in the blood. Hypothesis exist for possible ''causations''. Studies showed correlation between atherosclerosis and concentrations of particles. Further studies looked for correlations between nutrition and concentration of the distinguishable lipoprotein particles, e.g. whether the ratio of dietary fat raises or lowers levels of LDL particles. Studies showed that different phenotypes regarding the amount of particles and reaction to diet composition do exist.
