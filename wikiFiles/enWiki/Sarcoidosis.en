'''Sarcoidosis''' (from ''sarc'' meaning "flesh", ''-oid'', "like", and ''-osis'', "diseased or abnormal condition"), also called '''sarcoid''', '''[[Ernest Besnier|Besnier]]-[[Cæsar Peter Møller Boeck|Boeck]] disease''' or '''[[Ernest Besnier|Besnier]]-[[Cæsar Peter Møller Boeck|Boeck]]-[[Jörgen Nilsen Schaumann|Schaumann]] disease''', is a [[syndrome]] involving abnormal collections of chronic inflammatory cells ([[granulomas]]) that can form as nodules in multiple organs.<ref name="Merck">{{MerckHome|04|050|e||Sarcoidosis}}</ref>  The granulomas that appear are usually not of the [[necrosis|necrotizing]] variety and are most often located in the [[lung]]s or the [[lymph nodes]], but virtually any [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] can be affected. [[Natural history of disease|Onset]] is usually gradual. Sarcoidosis may be [[asymptomatic]] or [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]]. It commonly improves or clears up spontaneously. More than two-thirds of people with lung sarcoidosis have no symptoms after 9 years. About 50% have relapses. About 10% develop serious disability. Lung scarring or infection may lead to respiratory failure and death.<ref name="Merck"/> In chronic cases, symptoms may fluctuate over many years.<ref name="Harrison">[http://www.harrisonspractice.com/practice/ub/view/Harrisons%20Practice/141453/all/Sarcoidosis Harrison's Practice], Sarcoidosis.</ref> The causes of sarcoidosis are not completely understood.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baughman|first=RP|coauthors=Culver, DA; Judson, MA|title=A concise review of pulmonary sarcoidosis|journal=American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine|date=March 2011|volume=183|issue=5|pages=573–81|doi=10.1164/rccm.201006-0865CI|pmid=21037016|url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/content/183/5/573.long|accessdate=15 January 2013|pmc=3081278}}</ref>

Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ, although it is often [[asymptomatic]]. Common symptoms, which tend to be [[Non-specific symptoms|vague]], include [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] (unrelieved by sleep), [[asthenia|lack of energy]], [[weight loss]], aches and pains, [[arthritis]], [[xerophthalmia|dry eyes]], swelling of the knees, blurry vision, [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], a dry, hacking cough, or skin lesions. The cutaneous symptoms vary, and range from [[rash]]es and noduli (small bumps) to [[erythema nodosum]] or [[lupus pernio]]. Sarcoidosis and cancer may mimic one another, making the [[Differential diagnosis|distinction]] difficult.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tolaney SM, Colson YL, Gill RR, ''et al.'' |title=Sarcoidosis mimicking metastatic breast cancer |journal=Clin. Breast Cancer |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=804–10 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=18021484 |doi=10.3816/CBC.2007.n.044 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1526-8209(11)70784-4}}</ref>

The combination of [[erythema nodosum]], bilateral [[Hilum of lung|hilar]] [[lymphadenopathy]], and [[arthralgia]] is called [[Löfgren syndrome]]; it has a relatively good prognosis.

Renal, liver (including [[portal hypertension]]), heart,<ref>"Sarcoidosis and the Heart". Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research.'' Accessed 2 Dec 2007. [http://www.stopsarcoidosis.org/sarcoidosis/cardiac.htm]</ref> or brain involvement may cause further symptoms and altered functioning.

===Lungs===
Pulmonary localization is by far the most common in individuals with sarcoidosis. About 90% of patients have an abnormal chest X-ray at some time during the course of their disease.  Overall, about 50% develop permanent pulmonary abnormalities, and 5 to 15% have progressive fibrosis of the lung [[parenchyma]]. Sarcoidosis of the lung is primarily an [[interstitial lung disease]] in which the inflammatory process involves the alveoli, small bronchi, and small blood vessels. In acute and subacute cases,  physical examination usually reveals dry rales.<ref name="Harrison's">{{cite book |author=Isselbacher, Braunwald, Wilson, Martin, Fauci, Kasper  |title=Harrison's Principles Of Internal Medicine |publisher=McGraw Hill |edition=13th |year=1994 |isbn=0-07-032370-4 }}</ref>

===Liver===
Although liver biopsy reveals liver involvement in 60 to 90% of tested cases, liver dysfunction is usually not clinically significant.  About 20–30% of patients have [[hepatomegaly]] and/or biochemical evidence of liver involvement. Usually, these changes reflect a [[cholestatic]] pattern and include raised levels of [[alkaline phosphatase]], while [[bilirubin]] and [[aminotransferases]] are only mildly elevated. Jaundice is rare.<ref name="Harrison's"/>

===Skin===
Sarcoidosis involves the skin in about 25% of patients. The most common lesions are [[erythema nodosum]], plaques, [[maculopapular]] eruptions, subcutaneous nodules, and [[lupus pernio]]. Treatment is not required, since the lesions usually resolve spontaneously in two to four weeks. Although it may be disfiguring, cutaneous sarcoidosis rarely causes major problems.<ref name="Harrison's"/>

===Heart===
Although cardiac involvement is present in 20% to 30% of patients with sarcoidosis, only about 5% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis are symptomatic.<ref>Anna M. McDivit and Arman T. Askari, "A Middle-aged Man with Progressive Fatigue", Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine 2009; 76(10):564-574 {{cite doi|10.3949/ccjm.76a.08114}}</ref>  The presentation of cardiac sarcoidosis can range from asymptomatic conduction abnormalities to fatal ventricular arrhythmia.<ref>Heart. 2006 February; 92(2): 282–288. {{cite doi|10.1136/hrt.2005.080481}}</ref> Myocardial sarcoidosis can be a rare cause of sudden cardiac death.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reuhl J, Schneider M, Sievert H, Lutz FU, Zieger G |title=Myocardial sarcoidosis as a rare cause of sudden cardiac death |journal=Forensic Sci.

===Eye===
Manifestations in the eye include [[uveitis]], [[uveoparotitis]], and retinal inflammation, which may result in loss of visual acuity or blindness.
The combination of anterior uveitis, [[parotitis]], VII cranial nerve paralysis and fever is called uveoparotid fever, and is associated with Heerfordt-Waldenstrom syndrome. ({{ICD10|D|86|8|d|80}}) Development of scleral nodule associated with sarcoidosis have been observed.<ref>http://www.ajo.com/article/S0002-9394(03)00454-9/abstract</ref>

===Blood===
Abnormal clinical blood tests are frequent, but not diagnostic.  [[Anemia]] occurs in 4-20% of patients with sarcoidosis. [[Leukopenia]] (due to a reduced number of circulating lymphocytes <ref name="Lymphopenia">{{Cite journal | title = Studies of peripheral blood monocytes in pulmonary sarcoidosis | journal = Clin. Exp.

===Lymph nodes===
[[Lymphadenopathy]] is very common in sarcoidosis.  Intrathoracic nodes are enlarged in 75 to 90% of all patients; usually this involves the hilar nodes, but the paratracheal nodes are commonly involved.  Peripheral lymphadenopathy is very common, particularly involving the [[cervical lymph nodes|cervical]] (the most common head and neck manifestation of the disease),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chen HC, Kang BH, Lai CT, Lin YS |title=Sarcoidal granuloma in cervical lymph nodes |journal=J Chin Med Assoc |volume=68 |issue=7 |pages=339–42 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=16038376 |doi=10.1016/S1726-4901(09)70172-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1726-4901(09)70172-8}}</ref> axillary, epitrochlear, and inguinal nodes.  Palpation causes no pain.<ref name="Harrison's"/>

===Nervous system===
All components of the nervous system can be involved.  Sarcoidosis affecting the brain or nerves is known as [[neurosarcoidosis]]. Neurologic findings are observed in about 5% of patients.  Cranial nerves are predominantly affected, and peripheral facial nerve palsy, often bilateral, is the most common neurological manifestation of sarcoidosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Said G, Lacroix C, Plante-Bordeneuve V |title=Nerve granulomas and vasculitis in sarcoid peripheral neuropathy |journal=Brain |volume=125 |year=2002 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11844727|pmid=11844727 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=264–75 |doi=10.1093/brain/awf027}}</ref>  It occurs suddenly and is usually transient. Other common manifestations of neurosarcoid include optic nerve dysfunction, papilledema, palate dysfunction, hearing abnormalities, hypothalamic and pituitary abnormalities, chronic meningitis, and [[peripheral neuropathy]].<ref name="Harrison's"/> Intramedullary sarcoidosis is rare and occurs in less than 1% of cases. Usually, granulomatous involvement of the basal meninges subsequently affects the cranial nerves. Myelopathy may be the initial clinical presentation of intramedullary neurosarcoidosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sirotkin I, Melendez ND |title=Case of the month |journal=Diagnostic Imaging |volume=8 |date=April 2010 |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/display/article/113619/1549682}}</ref>

Another common finding in Sarcoidosis with neurological involvement is autonomic or sensory small fiber neuropathy.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21298560</ref><ref>http://www.hindawi.com/journals/prt/2012/256024/</ref> Autonomic involvement can mimic the [[Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome]]

===Exocrine glands===
[[Parotid]] enlargement is a classic feature of sarcoidosis, but clinically apparent parotid involvement occurs in less than 10% of patients. Bilateral involvement is the rule. The gland is usually not tender, but firm and smooth.  [[Xerostomia]] can occur; other  exocrine glands are affected only rarely.<ref name="Harrison's"/>

===Scalp===
Sarcoidosis of the scalp presents with diffuse or patchy hair loss.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{Rp|762|date=May 2009}}

==Causes==
The exact cause of sarcoidosis is not known. The current working hypothesis is, in genetically susceptible individuals, sarcoidosis is caused through alteration to the immune response after exposure to an environmental, occupational, or infectious agent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rossman MD, Kreider ME |title=Lesson learned from ACCESS (A Case Controlled Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis) |journal=Proc Am Thorac Soc |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=453–6 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17684288 |doi=10.1513/pats.200607-138MS }}</ref>

===Genetics===
Investigations of genetic susceptibility yielded many candidate genes, but only few were confirmed by further investigations and no reliable genetic markers are known.  Currently, the most interesting candidate gene is ''[[BTNL2]]''; several ''[[HLA-DR]]'' risk alleles are also being investigated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Iannuzzi MC |title=Advances in the genetics of sarcoidosis |journal=Proc Am Thorac Soc |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=457–60 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17684289 |doi=10.1513/pats.200606-136MS }}</ref> In persistent sarcoidosis, the HLA haplotype ''[[HLA-B7]]-[[HLA-DR15|DR15]]'' are either cooperating in disease or another gene between these two loci is associated. In nonpersistent disease, there is a strong genetic association with [[HLA DR3-DQ2]].<ref name="pmid14656748">{{cite journal |author=Grunewald J, Eklund A, Olerup O |title=Human leukocyte antigen class I alleles and the disease course in sarcoidosis patients |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=169 |issue=6 |pages=696–702 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=14656748 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200303-459OC }}</ref>
Siblings have only a modestly increased risk (hazard ratio 5-6) of developing the disease, indicating genetic susceptibility plays only a small role.  The alternate hypothesis that family members share similar exposures to environmental pathogens is quite plausible to explain the apparent hereditary factor.

===Infectious agents===
Several infectious agents appear to be significantly associated with sarcoidosis, but none of the known associations is specific enough to suggest a direct causative role.
''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]'' can be found in bronchoalveolar lavage of approximately 70% patients and is associated with disease activity; however, it can be also found in 23% of controls.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hiramatsu J, Kataoka M, Nakata Y |title=Propionibacterium acnes DNA detected in bronchoalveolar lavage cells from patients with sarcoidosis |journal=Sarcoidosis Vasc Diffuse Lung Dis |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=197–203 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14620162 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Inoue Y, Suga M |title=[Granulomatous diseases and pathogenic microorganism] |language=Japanese |journal=Kekkaku |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=115–30 |year=2008 |pmid=18326339 }}</ref>
A recent meta-analysis investigating the role of mycobacteria in sarcoidosis found it was present in 26.4% of cases, but the meta-analysis also detected a possible publication bias, so the results need further confirmation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gupta D, Agarwal R, Aggarwal AN, Jindal SK |title=Molecular evidence for the role of mycobacteria in sarcoidosis: a meta-analysis |journal=Eur. Respir. J. |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=508–16 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17537780 |doi=10.1183/09031936.00002607 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Almenoff PL, Johnson A, Lesser M, Mattman LH |title=Growth of acid fast L forms from the blood of patients with sarcoidosis |journal=Thorax |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=530–3 |year=1996 |month=May |pmid=8711683 |pmc=473601 |url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8711683 |doi=10.1136/thx.51.5.530}}</ref>

The disease has also been reported by transmission via [[organ transplant]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Padilla ML, Schilero GJ, Teirstein AS |title=Donor-acquired sarcoidosis |journal=Sarcoidosis Vasc Diffuse Lung Dis |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=18–24 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=12002380 }}</ref>

===Vitamin D dysregulation===
Sarcoidosis frequently causes an increase in [[vitamin D]] production outside the kidney.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barbour GL, Coburn JW, Slatopolsky E, Norman AW, Horst RL |title=Hypercalcemia in an anephric patient with sarcoidosis: evidence for extrarenal generation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=305 |issue=8 |pages=440–3 |year=1981 |month=August |pmid=6894783 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198108203050807 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJM198108203050807?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref> [[Macrophages]] / [[histiocytes]] inside the granulomas convert vitamin D from its inactive form 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active form, resulting in elevated levels of the hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and symptoms of [[hypervitaminosis D]] that may include [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[lack of strength]] or energy, [[irritability]], [[metallic taste]], temporary [[memory loss]] or cognitive problems. Physiological compensatory responses (e.g., suppression of the [[parathyroid hormone]] levels) may mean the patient does not develop frank [[hypercalcemia]]. This condition may be aggravated by high levels of [[estradiol]] and [[prolactin]], such as in pregnancy, leading to [[hypercalciuria]] and/or compensatory [[hypoparathyroidism]].<ref name=pregnancy>{{cite journal |author=Subramanian P, Chinthalapalli H, Krishnan M |title=Pregnancy and sarcoidosis: an insight into the pathogenesis of hypercalciuria |journal=Chest |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=995–8 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15364785 |doi=10.1378/chest.126.3.995 }}</ref> High levels of vitamin D are also implicated in immune-system dysfunctions which tie into the sarcoid condition.

===Hyperprolactinemia===
[[Prolactin]] is frequently increased in sarcoidosis; between 3% and 32% of cases have [[hyperprolactinemia]];<ref>{{cite journal |author=Porter N, Beynon HL, Randeva HS |title=Endocrine and reproductive manifestations of sarcoidosis |journal=QJM |volume=96 |issue=8 |pages=553–61 |year=2003 |pmid=12897340 |doi= 10.1093/qjmed/hcg103|url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12897340}}</ref> this frequently leads to [[amenorrhea]], [[galactorrhea]], or [[nonpuerperal mastitis]] in women.
Prolactin also has a broad spectrum of effects on the immune system, and increased prolactin levels are associated with disease activity or may exacerbate symptoms in many autoimmune diseases; treatment with prolactin-lowering medication has been shown effective in some cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yu-Lee LY |title=Prolactin modulation of immune and inflammatory responses |journal=Recent Prog. Horm. Res. |volume=57 |pages=435–55 |year=2002 |pmid=12017556 |doi= 10.1210/rp.57.1.435|url=http://rphr.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12017556}}</ref>
However, it is unknown if this relation holds in sarcoidosis, and the gender predilection in sarcoidosis is less pronounced than in some other autoimmune diseases, where such relation has been established. In pregnancy, the effects of prolactin and estrogen counteract each other to some degree, with a slight trend to improve pulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis, while lupus, uveitis and arthralgia might slightly worsen.<ref name=pregnancy/> Lupus, uveitis and arthralgia are known to be, in some cases, associated with increased prolactin levels, and respond to bromocriptin treatment, but so far, this has not been investigated specifically for sarcoidosis.
The reasons for increased prolactin levels in sarcoidosis are uncertain. Prolactin has been shown to be produced by T-lymphocytes in some autoimmune disorders in amounts high enough to affect the feedback by the hypothalamic dopaminergic system.<ref name=M_eacute_ndez_2004_14870917>{{cite journal |author=M&eacute;ndez I, Alcocer-Varela J, Parra A |title=Neuroendocrine dopaminergic regulation of prolactin release in systemic lupus erythematosus: a possible role of lymphocyte-derived prolactin |journal=Lupus |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=45–53 |year=2004 |pmid=14870917 |doi= 10.1191/0961203304lu487oa|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0961-2033&volume=13&issue=1&spage=45&aulast=M&eacute;ndez}}</ref>

The extrapituitary prolactin is believed to play a role as a [[cytokine]]-like proinflammatory factor. Prolactin antibodies are believed to play a role in hyperprolactinemia in other autoimmune disorders, and high-prevalence endocrine autoimmunity has been observed in patients with sarcoidosis.<ref name=Papadopoulos_1996_8616531>{{cite journal |author=Papadopoulos KI, Hörnblad Y, Liljebladh H, Hallengren B |title=High frequency of endocrine autoimmunity in patients with sarcoidosis |journal=Eur. J. Endocrinol. |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=331–6 |year=1996 |month=March |pmid=8616531 |doi= 10.1530/eje.0.1340331|url=}}</ref> It may also be a consequence of renal disease or treatment with steroids. Neurosarcoidosis may occasionally cause hypopituitarism, but has not been reported to cause hyperprolactinemia.

===Thyroid disease===
In women, a substantial association of [[thyroid]] disease and sarcoidosis has been reported. The association is less marked, but still significant, for male patients. Female patients have a significantly elevated risk for hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity, and autoimmunity appears to be very important in the pathogenesis of thyroid disease in this population. Thyroid granulomatosis, on the other hand, is uncommon.<ref name=Antonelli_2006_16899854/>

===Autoimmune===
Association of [[autoimmune]] disorders has been frequently observed. The exact mechanism of this relation is not known, but some evidence supports the hypothesis that this is a consequence of Th1 lymphokine prevalence.<ref name=Antonelli_2006_16899854/><ref name=Romagnani_1997_9190109>{{cite journal |author=Romagnani S |title=The Th1/Th2 paradigm |journal=Immunol.

Sarcoidosis has been associated with [[celiac disease]], a condition in which a chronic reaction to certain protein chains, commonly referred to as glutens, found in some cereal grains, occurs. This reaction causes destruction of the villi in the small intestine, with resulting malabsorption of nutrients.

An association with [[type IV hypersensitivity]] has been described.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic1100.htm |title=eMedicine - Hypersensitivity Reactions, Delayed : Article by Walter Duane Hinshaw |work= |accessdate=2008-09-18}}</ref> Tests of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity have been used to measure progression.<ref name="pmid11948059">{{cite journal |author=Morell F, Levy G, Orriols R, Ferrer J, De Gracia J, Sampol G |title=Delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity tests and lymphopenia as activity markers in sarcoidosis |journal=Chest |volume=121 |issue=4 |pages=1239–44 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=11948059 |doi= 10.1378/chest.121.4.1239|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11948059}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Granulomatous inflammation is characterized primarily by accumulation of [[monocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s and activated [[T-lymphocytes]], with increased production of key inflammatory mediators, [[TNF-alpha]], [[IFN-gamma]], and [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]], characteristic of a [[T helper cell|Th1]]-polarized response (T-helper lymphocyte-1 response).  Sarcoidosis has paradoxical effects on inflammatory processes; it is characterized by increased macrophage and CD4 helper T-cell activation, resulting in accelerated inflammation, but immune response to antigen challenges such as tuberculin is suppressed. This paradoxic state of simultaneous hyper- and hypoactivity is suggestive of a state of [[anergy]]. The anergy may also be responsible for the increased risk of infections and cancer. The regulatory T-lymphocytes in the periphery of sarcoid granulomas appear to suppress IL-2 secretion, which is hypothesized to cause the state of anergy by preventing antigen-specific memory responses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kettritz R, Goebel U, Fiebeler A, Schneider W, Luft F |title=The protean face of sarcoidosis revisited |journal=Nephrol.

While TNF-alpha is widely believed to play an important role in the formation of granulomas, sarcoidosis can be triggered by treatment with the TNF-alpha antagonist [[etanercept]].<ref name=Verschueren_2007_17340045>{{cite journal | author=Verschueren K, Van Essche E, Verschueren P, Taelman V, Westhovens R | title=Development of sarcoidosis in etanercept-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients | journal=Clin.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of sarcoidosis is often a matter of exclusion.  To exclude sarcoidosis in a case presenting with pulmonary symptoms might involve [[chest X-ray]], [[CT scan]] of chest, [[PET scan]], CT-guided biopsy, mediastinoscopy, open lung biopsy, bronchoscopy with biopsy, endobronchial ultrasound and [[endoscopic ultrasound]] with [[FNA]] of mediastinal [[lymph nodes]](EBUS FNA). [[Tissue (biology)|Tissue]] from [[biopsy]] of lymph nodes is subjected to both [[flow cytometry]] to rule out cancer and special stains ([[acid fast]] bacilli stain and [[Gömöri methenamine silver stain]]) to rule out [[microorganisms]] and [[fungi]]. [[Angiotensin-converting enzyme]] blood levels are used in diagnosis and monitoring of sarcoidosis.<ref>http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/ace/test.html</ref>

Differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease, lymphoma, septic emboli, [[rheumatoid nodule]]s, [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], varicella infection, and atypical infections, such as ''Mycobacterium avium'' complex, cytomegalovirus, and cryptococci.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Allmendinger A, Perone R |title=Case of the Month |journal=Diagnostic Imaging |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=10 |year=2009 |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/display/article/113619/1451377}}</ref>
Sarcoidosis is confused most commonly with neoplastic diseases, such as lymphoma, or with disorders characterized also by a mononuclear cell granulomatous inflammatory process, such as the mycobacterial and fungal disorders.<ref name="Harrison's"/>

Because of the wide range of possible manifestations, the investigations to confirm diagnosis may involve many organs and methods, depending on initial presentation.

Very often, sarcoidosis presents as a restrictive disease of the lungs, causing a decrease in [[lung volume]] and decreased [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]] (the ability to stretch); hence, chest X-ray and other methods are used to assess the severity or rule out pulmonary disease.

The disease typically limits the amount of air drawn into the lungs, but produces higher than normal expiratory flow ratios. The [[vital capacity]] (full breath in, to full breath out) is decreased, and most of this air can be blown out in the first second. This means the [[spirometry|FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio]] is increased from the normal of about 80%, to 90%. Obstructive lung changes, causing a decrease in the amount of air that can be exhaled, may occur when enlarged lymph nodes in the chest compress airways or when internal inflammation or nodules impede airflow.

[[Image:Sarkoidose1 CT axial.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Computed tomography|CT scan]] of the chest showing [[lymphadenopathy]] (arrows) in the [[mediastinum]] due to sarcoidosis]]

Chest X-ray changes are divided into four stages:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Joanne Mambretti |year=2004 |title=Chest X-ray Stages of Sarcoidosis |journal=Journal of Insurance Medicine |volume= |issue= |pages=91–92 |publisher= |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://www.aaimedicine.org/journal-of-insurance-medicine/jim/2004/036-01-0091.pdf |accessdate=June 3, 2012}}</ref>
* Stage 1: [[bihilar lymphadenopathy]]
* Stage 2: bihilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular infiltrates
* Stage 3: bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
* Stage 4: fibrocystic sarcoidosis typically with upward hilar retraction, cystic and bullous changes
Although patients with stage 1 X-rays tend to have the acute or subacute, reversible form of the disease, those with stages 2 and 3 often have the chronic, progressive disease; these patterns do not represent consecutive "stages" of sarcoidosis.  Thus, except for epidemiologic purposes, this X-ray categorization is mostly of historic interest.<ref name="Harrison's"/>

Investigations to assess involvement of other organs frequently involve [[electrocardiogram]], ocular examination by an ophthalmologist, [[liver function tests]], renal function tests, serum calcium, and 24-hour urine calcium.

In sarcoidosis presenting in the Caucasian population, hilar adenopathy and erythema nodosum are the most common initial symptoms. In this population, a biopsy of the gastrocnemius muscle is a useful tool in correctly diagnosing the patient. The presence of a noncaseating epithelioid granuloma in a gastrocnemius specimen is definitive evidence of sarcoidosis, as other tuberculoid and fungal diseases extremely rarely present histologically in this muscle.<ref>Adonopoulos A.P et al. Asymptomatic gastrocnemius muscle biopsy: an extremely sensitive and specific test in the pathological confirmation of sarcoidosis presenting with hilar adenopathy. Clinical and experimental Rheumatology, 2001, 19(5), pp. 569-572.</ref> 

In female patients, sarcoidosis is significantly associated with hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and other thyroid diseases, hence close surveillance of thyroid function is recommended.<ref name=Antonelli_2006_16899854>{{cite journal |author=Antonelli A, Fazzi P, Fallahi P, Ferrari SM, Ferrannini E |title=Prevalence of hypothyroidism and Graves disease in sarcoidosis |journal=Chest |volume=130 |issue=2 |pages=526–32 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16899854 |doi=10.1378/chest.130.2.526 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
Between 30 and 70% of patients do not require therapy.<ref name=nunes/> For patients presenting with lung symptoms, unless the respiratory impairment is devastating, active pulmonary sarcoidosis is observed usually without therapy for two to three months; if the inflammation does not subside spontaneously, therapy is instituted.<ref name="Harrison's"/> [[Corticosteroid]]s, most commonly [[prednisolone]], have been the standard treatment for many years. In some patients, this treatment can slow or reverse the course of the disease, but other patients do not respond to steroid therapy. The use of corticosteroids in mild disease is controversial because in many cases the disease remits spontaneously.<ref>{{cite journal | last=White | first=E.S. | year=2007 | month=June | title=Current and emerging strategies for the management of sarcoidosis | journal=Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy | volume= 8 | issue=9 | pages=1293–1311 | doi=10.1517/14656566.8.9.1293 | pmid=17563264 | last2=Lynch Jp | first2=3rd }}</ref> Additionally, corticosteroids have many recognized dose- and duration-related side effects, and their use is generally limited to severe, progressive, or organ-threatening disease. The influence of corticosteroids or other [[immunosuppressant]]s on the natural history is unclear.

Severe symptoms are generally treated with steroids, and [[steroid-sparing agent]]s such as [[azathioprine]] and [[methotrexate]] are often used.  Rarely, [[cyclophosphamide]] has also been used.  As the granulomas are caused by collections of immune system cells, particularly [[T cell]]s, there has been some early indications of success using immunosuppressants, [[interleukin-2]] inhibitors, or anti[[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] treatment (such as [[infliximab]]). Unfortunately, none of these has provided reliable treatment, and there can be significant side effects such as an increased risk of reactivating latent [[tuberculosis]]. Antitumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment with etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis has been observed to cause sarcoidosis.<ref name=Verschueren_2007_17340045/>

Because sarcoidosis can affect multiple organ systems, follow-up on a patient with sarcoidosis should always include an [[electrocardiogram]], ocular examination by an ophthalmologist, [[liver function tests]], serum calcium, and 24-hour urine calcium.<ref name=Antonelli_2006_16899854/>

==Prognosis==
[[File:Sarcoidosis - Honeycombing.jpg|thumb|right|Gross pathology image showing sarcoidosis with honeycombing: Prominent honeycombing is present in the lower lobes accompanied by fibrosis and some honeycombing in the upper lungs.

The disease can remit spontaneously or become chronic, with exacerbations and remissions. In some patients, it can progress to [[pulmonary fibrosis]] and death.  About half of the cases resolve without treatment or can be cured within 12–36 months, and most within five years.  Some cases persist several decades.<ref name=nunes/>  When the heart is involved, the prognosis is poor.<ref name=Syed04>{{cite journal |author=Syed J, Myers R |title=Sarcoid heart disease |journal=Can J Cardiol |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=89–93 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14968147 }}</ref> Patients with sarcoidosis appear to be at significantly increased risk for cancer, in particular [[lung cancer]], malignant [[lymphoma]]s,<ref name="Karakantza-1996">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Karakantza | first1 = M. | last2 = Matutes | first2 = E. | last3 = MacLennan | first3 = K. | last4 = O'Connor | first4 = NT. | last5 = Srivastava | first5 = PC. | last6 = Catovsky | first6 = D. | title = Association between sarcoidosis and lymphoma revisited | journal = J Clin Pathol | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 208–12 | month = March | year = 1996 | doi =  10.1136/jcp.49.3.208| pmid = 8675730  | pmc = 500399 }}</ref> and cancer in other organs known to be affected in sarcoidosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Askling J, Grunewald J, Eklund A, Hillerdal G, Ekbom A |title=Increased risk for cancer following sarcoidosis |journal=Am.

==Epidemiology==
Sarcoidosis most commonly affects young adults of both sexes, although studies have reported more cases in females. Incidence is highest for individuals younger than 40 and peaks in the age-group from 20 to 29 years; a second peak is observed for women over 50.<ref name=nunes>{{cite journal |author=Nunes H, Bouvry D, Soler P, Valeyre D |title=Sarcoidosis |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=2 |pages=46 |year=2007 |pmid=18021432 |pmc=2169207 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-46 |url=}}</ref><ref name=Syed04/>

Sarcoidosis occurs throughout the world in all races with an average incidence of 16.5 per 100,000 in men and 19 per 100,000 in women. The disease is most prevalent in Northern European countries and the highest annual incidence of 60 per 100,000 is found in Sweden and Iceland. In the [[United Kingdom]] the prevalence is 16 in 100,000.<ref>{{cite book |last= Sam |first= Amir H. |coauthors= James T.H. Teo |title= [[Rapid Medicine]] |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year= 2010 |isbn= 1405183233}}</ref> In the United States, sarcoidosis is more common in people of [[African]] descent than [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]], with annual incidence reported as 35.5 and 10.9 per 100,000, respectively.<ref name="Henke">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Henke | first1 = CE. | last2 = Henke | first2 = G. | last3 = Elveback | first3 = LR. | last4 = Beard | first4 = CM. | last5 = Ballard | first5 = DJ. | last6 = Kurland | first6 = LT. | title = The epidemiology of sarcoidosis in Rochester, Minnesota: a population-based study of incidence and survival | journal = Am J Epidemiol | volume = 123 | issue = 5 | pages = 840–5 | month = May | year = 1986 | pmid = 3962966 }}</ref> Sarcoidosis is less commonly reported in South America, Spain, India, Canada, and the Philippines. There may be a higher susceptibility to sarcoidosis in those with [[coeliac disease]]. An association between the two disorders has been suggested.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rutherford RM, Brutsche MH, Kearns M, Bourke M, Stevens F, Gilmartin JJ |title=Prevalence of coeliac disease in patients with sarcoidosis |journal=Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=911–5 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15316417 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0954-691X&volume=16&issue=9&spage=911 |doi=10.1097/00042737-200409000-00016}}</ref>

The differing incidence across the world may be at least partially attributable to the lack of screening programs in certain regions of the world, and the overshadowing presence of other granulomatous diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], that may interfere with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis where they are prevalent.<ref name=Syed04/>
There may also be differences in the severity of the disease between people of different ethnicities. Several studies suggest  the presentation in people of African origin may be more severe and disseminated than for Caucasians, who are more likely to have asymptomatic disease.<ref name="Am Thor Soc">{{cite pmid|10430755}}</ref>

Manifestation appears to be slightly different according to race and sex. [[Erythema nodosum]] is far more common in men than in women and in Caucasians than in other races. In Japanese patients, ophthalmologic and cardiac involvement are more common than in other races.<ref name=nunes/>

Sarcoidosis is one of the few pulmonary diseases with a higher prevalence in nonsmokers.<ref name="Thor">{{Cite doi|10.1136/thx.32.5.567}}</ref>

==Pregnancy==
Sarcoidosis generally does not prevent successful pregnancy and delivery; the endogenous estrogen in pregnancy may even have a slightly beneficial immunomodulatory effect. In most cases, the course of the disease is unaffected by pregnancy, with improvement in a few cases and worsening of symptoms in very few cases.<ref name=pregnancy/>

Autoimmune disorders, including sarcoidosis, are listed as a significant risk factor for developing [[pre-eclampsia]], a hypertensive complication of the second and/or third trimesters of pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia is a high-risk condition and the patient should be referred to a maternal/fetal health expert, or perinatologist. http://www.preeclampsia.org/health-information/faq<ref>Preeclampsia Foundation FAQ - www.preeclampsia.org</ref>
