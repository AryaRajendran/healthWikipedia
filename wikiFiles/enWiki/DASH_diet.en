The '''DASH diet''' ('''D'''ietary '''A'''pproaches to '''S'''top '''H'''ypertension) is a dietary pattern promoted by the [[United States|U.S.]]-based [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] (part of the [[National Institutes of Health]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]) to prevent and control [[hypertension]]. The DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods; includes meat, fish, poultry, nuts and beans; and is limited in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, red meat, and added fats. In addition to its effect on blood pressure, it is designed to be a well-balanced approach to eating for the general public. It is now recommended by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) as an ideal eating plan for all Americans.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The DASH diet is based on NIH studies that examined three dietary plans and their results. None of the plans was [[vegetarian]], but the DASH plan incorporated more fruits and vegetables, low fat or nonfat dairy, beans, and nuts than the others studied. Not only does the plan emphasize good eating habits, but it also suggests healthy alternatives to "[[junk food]]" and discourages the consumption of processed foods. The NIH has published a guidebook, [http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/ "Your Guide to Lowering your Blood Pressure With DASH"], which details the nutrition facts of popular mainstream food items and their healthy alternatives. The manual also provides samples of meal plans and proportions along with their associated nutritional information. The last pages of the manual provides a list of resources and how to obtain them.

The diet reduced [[systolic blood pressure]] by 6 [[Torr|mm Hg]] and [[diastolic blood pressure]] by 3&nbsp;mm Hg in patients with high normal blood pressure, now called "pre-hypertension." Those with hypertension dropped by 11 and 6, respectively. These changes in blood pressure occurred with no changes in body weight. The DASH dietary pattern is adjusted based on daily caloric intake ranging from 1699 to 3100 dietary [[calorie]]s.<ref name="dashguide">{{cite web

The higher the BP, the greater is the chance of heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease. For individuals 40–70 years of age, each increment of 20 mm Hg in systolic BP (SBP) or 10 mm Hg in diastolic BP (DBP) doubles the risk of CVD across the entire BP range from 115/75 to 185/115 mm Hg.”.<ref name= "Sacks 1997"/>

The prevalence of hypertension led the U.S. [National Institutes of Health] (NIH) to propose funding to further research the role of dietary patterns on blood pressure. In 1992 the NHLBI worked with five of the most well-respected medical research centers in different cities across the U.S. to conduct the largest and most detailed research study to date.  The DASH study used a rigorous design called a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and it involved teams of physicians, nurses, nutritionists, statisticians and research coordinators working in a cooperative venture in which participants were selected and studied in each of the these five research facilities. The chosen facilities and locales for this multi-center study were (1) [[Johns Hopkins University]] in Baltimore, Maryland, (2) [[Duke University Medical Center]] in Durham, North Carolina, (3) [[Kaiser Permanente]] Center for Health Research in Portland, Oregon, (4) [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in Boston, Massachusetts and (5) [[Pennington Biomedical Research Center]] in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.<ref name="dashguide"/>

Two DASH trials were designed and carried out as multi-center, randomized, outpatient feeding studies with the purpose of testing the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure. The standardized multi-center protocol is an approach used in many large-scale multi-center studies funded by the NHLBI. A unique feature of the DASH diet was that the foods and menu were chosen based on conventionally consumed food items so it could be more easily adopted by the general public if results were positive.<ref name = "NEJM Appel 1997">{{cite journal

Two experimental diets were selected for the DASH study and compared with each other, and with a third: the control diet. The control diet was low in potassium, calcium, magnesium and fiber and featured a fat and protein profile so that the pattern was consistent with (a “typical American diet at the time”<ref name="dashguide"/>). The first experimental diet was higher in fruits and vegetables but otherwise similar to the control diet (a “fruits and vegetables diet” <ref name = "Moore 2001"/>), with the exception of fewer snacks and sweets. Magnesium and Potassium levels were close to the 75th percentile of U.S. consumption in the fruits-and-vegetables diet, which also featured a high fiber profile. The second experimental diet was high in fruits-and-vegetables and in low-fat dairy products, as well as lower in overall fat and saturated fat, with higher fiber and higher protein compared with the control diet—this diet has been called “the DASH Diet”.<ref name="JNC-Report7"/> The DASH diet (or combination diet) was rich in potassium, magnesium and calcium—a nutrient profile roughly equivalent with the 75th percentile of U.S. consumption.  The combination or “DASH” diet was also high in whole grains, poultry, fish and nuts while being lower in red meat content, sweets and sugar-containing beverages.<ref name="Lewington 2002">{{cite journal

The DASH diet was designed to provide liberal amounts of key nutrients thought to play a part in lowering blood pressure, based on past epidemiologic studies.  One of the unique features of the DASH study was that dietary patterns rather than single nutrients were being tested.<ref name = "NEJM Appel 1997"/> The DASH diet also features a high quotient of anti-oxidant rich foods thought by some to retard or prevent chronic health problems including cancer, heart disease and stroke.<ref name="dashguide"/>

8,813 people were screened for the study, out of which were ultimately chosen 459 participants whose demographic characteristics most closely resembled the target population and study requirements. The sample population consisted of healthy men and women with an average age of 46, with systolic blood pressures of less than 160&nbsp;mm Hg and diastolic blood pressures within 80 to 95&nbsp;mm Hg. African-American and other minority groups were planned to comprise 67% of the study sample, with 49% of the sample being female.<ref name = "NEJM Appel 1997"/> Indeed, due to the exceptional burden of high blood pressure in minority populations, especially among African-Americans, a major goal of the trial was to recruit enough ethnic minorities to constitute two thirds of the target sample.<ref name = "Moore 2001"/>

Participants ate one of the three aforementioned dietary patterns in 3 separate phases of the trial, including (1) Screening, (2), Run-in and (3) Intervention. In the screening phase, participants were screened for eligibility based on the combined results of blood pressure readings. In the 3 week run-in phase, each subject was given the control diet for 3 weeks, had their blood pressure measurements taken on each of five separate days, gave one 24-hour urine sample and completed a questionnaire on symptoms. At this point, subjects who were compliant with the feeding program during the screening phase were each randomly assigned to one of the three diets outlined above, to begin at the start of the 4th week. The intervention phase followed next; this was an 8-week period in which the subjects were provided the diet to which they had been randomly assigned. Blood pressures and urine samples were collected again during this time together with symptom & physical activity recall questionnaires. The first group of study subjects began the run-in phase of the trial in September 1994 while the fifth and final group began in January 1996.<ref name = "Moore 2001"/> Each of the three diets contained the same 3&nbsp;grams (3,000&nbsp;mg) of sodium, selected because that was the approximate average intake in the nation at the time. Participants were also given two packets of salt, each containing 200&nbsp;mg of sodium, for discretionary use. Alcohol was limited to no more than two beverages per day, and caffeine intake was limited to no more than three caffeinated beverages.<ref name="Lewington 2002"/>

== Study results ==
The DASH trial showed that dietary patterns can and do affect blood pressure in the high normal BP to moderately hypertensive adult population (systolic < 180&nbsp;mm Hg & diastolic of 80 to 95&nbsp;mm Hg).<ref name = "Moore 2001"/> Respectively, the DASH  or “combination” diet lowered blood pressures by an average of 5.5 and 3.0&nbsp;mm Hg for systolic and diastolic, compared with the control diet. The minority portion of the study sample and the hypertensive portion both showed the largest reductions in blood pressure from the combination diet against the control diet. The hypertensive subjects experienced a drop of 11.4&nbsp;mm Hg in their systolic and 5.5&nbsp;mm Hg in their diastolic phases.<ref name = "Moore 2001"/>  The fruits-and-vegetables diet was also successful, although it produced more modest reductions compared with the control diet (2.8&nbsp;mm Hg systolic and 1.1&nbsp;mm Hg diastolic).<ref name="Lewington 2002"/> In the subjects with and without hypertension, the combination diet effectively reduced blood pressure more than the fruits-and-vegetables diet or the control diet did. The data indicated that reductions in blood pressure occurred within two weeks of subjects’ starting their designated diets,<ref name="Lewington 2002"/> and that the results were generalizable to the target sample of the U.S. population.<ref name = "Moore 2001"/> Side effects were negligible, but the NEJM study reports that some subjects reported constipation as a problem. At the end of the intervention phase, 10.1, 5.4 & 4.0 percent of the subjects reported this problem for the control, fruits-and-vegetables and combination diets, respectively, showing that the fruits and vegetables and combination diets reduce constipation. Apart from only one subject (on the control diet) who was suffering from cholecystitis, other gastrointestinal symptoms had a low rate of incidence.

== DASH-Sodium study design ==
The DASH-Sodium study was conducted following the end of the original DASH study to determine whether the DASH diet could produce even better results if it were low in salt and also to examine the effects of different levels of sodium in people eating the DASH diet.<ref name="dashguide"/> The researchers were interested in determining the effects of sodium reduction when combined with the DASH diet as well as the effects of the DASH diet when at three levels of sodium intake. The DASH-Sodium trial was conducted from September 1997 through November 1999. Like the previous study, it was based on a large sample (412 participants) and was a multi-center, randomized, outpatient feeding study where the subjects were given all their food.<ref name="Karanja 2004">{{cite journal

The DASH diet was the same as in the previous DASH study. After being assigned to one of these two diets, the participants were given diets that differed by 3 distinct levels of sodium content, corresponding to 3,000&nbsp;mg, 2,400&nbsp;mg or 1,500&nbsp;mg/day (higher, intermediate or lower), in random order, for 30 consecutive days each.<ref name="Lewington 2002"/> During the two week run-in phase, all participants ate the high sodium control diet. The 30 day intervention phase followed, in which subjects ate their assigned diets at each of the aforementioned sodium levels (high, intermediate and low) in random order, in a crossover design.<ref name="Karanja 2004"/> During the 30 day dietary intervention phase, each participant therefore consumed his or her assigned diet (either DASH or control) at all three sodium levels.

== DASH-Sodium Study results and conclusions ==
The primary outcome of the DASH-Sodium study was systolic blood pressure at the end of the 30 day dietary intervention periods. The secondary outcome was diastolic blood pressure. The DASH-Sodium study found that reductions in sodium intake produced significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both the control and DASH diets. Study results indicate that the quantity of dietary sodium in the control diet was twice as powerful in its effect on blood pressure as it was in the DASH diet. Importantly, the control diet sodium reductions from intermediate to low correlated with greater changes in systolic blood pressure than those same changes from high to intermediate (change equal to roughly 40&nbsp;mmol per day, or 1&nbsp;gram of sodium). 

As stated by Sacks, F. et al., reductions in sodium intake by this amount per day correlated with greater decreases in blood pressure when the starting sodium intake level was already at the U.S. [[Dietary Reference Intake|recommended dietary allowance]], than when the starting level was higher (higher levels are the actual average in the U.S.).  These results led researchers to postulate that the adoption of a national lower daily allowance for sodium than the currently held 2,400&nbsp;mg could be based on the sound scientific results provided by this study.<ref name="Karanja 2004"/> The U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating a diet of 2300&nbsp;mg of sodium a day or lower, with a recommendation of 1500&nbsp;mg/day in adults who have elevated blood pressure; the 1500&nbsp;mg/day is the low sodium level tested in the DASH-Sodium study.
 
The DASH diet and the control diet at the lower salt levels were both successful in lowering blood pressure, but the largest reductions in blood pressure were obtained by eating a combination of these two (i.e., a lower-salt version of the DASH diet). The effect of this combination at a sodium level of 1,500&nbsp;mg/day was an average blood pressure reduction of 8.9/4.5&nbsp;mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). The hypertensive subjects experienced an average reduction of 11.5/5.7&nbsp;mm Hg.<ref name="Lewington 2002"/> The DASH-sodium results indicate that low sodium levels correlated with the largest reductions in blood pressure for participants at both pre-hypertensive and hypertensive levels, with the hypertensive participants showing the greatest reductions in blood pressure overall.
