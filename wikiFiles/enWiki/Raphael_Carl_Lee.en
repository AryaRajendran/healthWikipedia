'''Raphael Carl Lee''' (born October 29, 1949 [[Sumter, South Carolina]]) is an American surgeon, medical researcher, biomedical engineer, and entrepreneur.

==Life==
  Lee spent his childhood and adolescence in South Carolina. During medical school and graduate school he lived in Philadelphia, Chicago and Boston. Today, he practices reconstructive plastic surgery at the University of Chicago. Mostly his research has focused on advancing the care of trauma victims. Lee is recognized for the application of multiblock copolymer surfactants to mimic behavior of natural chaperone proteins to augment the body's self-repair capability following major injury. He has also contributed to understanding the biophysical mechanisms of tissue injury in victims of electrical shock. 

He serves as the: Paul S. and Ailene T. Professorship in Surgery, Medicine, Organismal Biology & Anatomy, and Molecular Medicine at the [[University of Chicago]]. 
 
He graduated from the [[University of South Carolina]], in electrical engineering in 1971, and [[Temple University]] School of Medicine and [[Drexel University]] with M.D. and M.S. degrees in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|title=Department of Surgery - Faculty - Raphael Lee, MD |url=http://surgicalresearch.bsd.uchicago.edu/faculty/lee/ |publisher= University of Chicago |accessdate=2010-05-31}}</ref> He was a resident in surgery at the [[University of Chicago Hospitals]] in 1975 to 1981 and at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] 1981 to 1983. While a resident at the University of Chicago, he enrolled in the [[Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology]] doctoral program. He received a Sc.D. in bioelectrical engineering from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|date=May 23, 2003 |title=The HistoryMakers Video Oral History Interview with Raphael Lee |url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/programs/dvl/files/Lee_Ralphaelb.html |publisher=The HistoryMakers |accessdate=2010-05-31}}</ref>
