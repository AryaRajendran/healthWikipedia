In [[medicine]], specifically in [[end-of-life care]], '''palliative sedation''' (also known as '''terminal sedation''', '''continuous deep sedation''', or '''sedation for intractable distress in the dying'''/'''of a dying patient''') is the [[palliative treatment|palliative]] practice of relieving distress in a [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] person in the last hours or days of a dying patient's life, usually by means of a continuous [[intravenous]] or [[subcutaneous]] infusion of a [[sedative]] [[drug]]. This is an option of last resort for patients whose symptoms cannot be controlled by any other means. This should be differentiated from [[euthanasia]] as the goal of palliative sedation is to control symptoms through sedation but not shorten the patient's life, while in [[euthanasia]] the goal is to shorten life to cease suffering.

According to 2009 research, 16.5% of all deaths in the United Kingdom during 2007-2008 took place after continuous deep sedation.<ref>C Seale (2009), End-of-life decisions in the UK involving medical practitioners, ''Palliative Medicine'', '''23'''(3), 198-204. {{doi|10.1177/0269216308102042}} PMID 19318459 ; also [http://www.ncpc.org.uk/download/newsroom/pressReleases/NCPC_CliveSearle_BackgroundBriefing_20Mar09.pdf press briefing]</ref><ref>C.

==General practice==
Palliative sedation is often initiated at the patient's request. It can also be initiated by the physician who would discuss the option with the patient and family. Palliative sedation can be used for short periods with the plan to awaken the patient after a given time period, making terminal sedation a less correct term. The patient is sedated while symptom control is attempted, then the patient is awakened to see if symptom control is achieved. In some cases, palliative sedation is begun with the plan to not attempt to reawaken the patient. One such common example is a patient with an enlarging cancer in the throat that compresses the trachea in a patient who does not want [[intubation]] or a [[tracheostomy]], so that eventually symptom control is impossible. Instead of experiencing death by suffocation, once symptoms are intolerable some patients will request palliative sedation to ease their symptoms as death approaches.

== Drugs used ==
A typical drug is [[midazolam]], a short acting [[benzodiazepine]]. [[Opioid]]s such as [[morphine]] are not used as the primary medicine since they are not effective sedative medications compared to benzodiazepines.  However, if a patient was already on an opioid for pain relief, this is continued for pain relief while sedation is achieved.  Other medications to be considered include [[haloperidol]], [[chlorpromazine]], [[pentobarbital]], propofol or [[phenobarbital]].

== Discomfort ==

While the intent of palliative sedation is to eliminate pain and suffering, a significant minority of patients "continue to experience pain, [[dysphoria]], or nausea", suffering that is commonly unknown to providers or families.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kon AA |title=Palliative Sedation: It's Not a Panacea |journal=[[American Journal of Bioethics]] |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=41–2 |year=2011 |month=June |pmid=21678216 |doi=10.1080/15265161.2011.577513 |url=}}</ref>

== Nutrition and fluids ==
As patients undergoing terminal sedation are typically in the last hours or days of their lives, they are not usually eating or drinking significant amounts.  There has not been any conclusive studies to demonstrate benefit to initiating artificial nutrition (TPN, tube feedings, etc.) or artificial hydration (subcutaneous or [[intravenous fluids]]). There is also the risk that IV fluids or feedings can worsen symptoms, especially respiratory secretions and pulmonary congestion. If the goal of palliative sedation is comfort, IV fluids and feedings are often not consistent with this goal.<ref name="Maltoni2009">Maltoni, M. ''et al'' (2009), [http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/7/1163.abstract Palliative sedation therapy does not hasten death: results from a prospective multicenter study], ''Annals of Oncology'' '''20'''(7), 1163–1169. {{doi|10.1093/annonc/mdp048}}</ref>   Before initiating terminal sedation, a discussion about the risks, benefits and goals of nutrition and fluids is encouraged, and is mandatory in the United Kingdom.

== Sedation vs. Euthanasia ==
There is no evidence that titrated sedation causes the death of the patient and sedation does not equate with [[euthanasia]].<ref name="Maltoni2009" /> At the end of life sedation is only used if the patient perceives their distress to be unbearable, and there are no other means of relieving that distress.  In [[palliative care]] the doses of sedatives are titrated (i.e. varied) to keep the patient comfortable without compromising respiration or hastening death. Death results from the underlying medical condition. For more information on the palliative care use of sedatives and the safe use of opioids see [[Opioids]].

Patients (or their legal representatives) only have the right to refuse treatments in living wills, they cannot demand life saving treatments, or any treatments at all. However, once unconsciousness begins, as the patient is no longer able to decide to stop the sedation or to request food or water,  the clinical team can  act in the patient's  best interests. A Living Will, made when competent, can under UK law, give a directive that they refuse 'Palliative Care' or 'Terminal Sedation', or 'any drug likely to suppress my respiration'.

== Legal position ==
===United States of America===
In 2008, the [[American Medical Association]] Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs approved an ethical policy regarding the practice of palliative sedation.<ref>Kevin B. O'Reilly, [http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/07/07/prsi0707.htm AMA meeting: AMA OKs palliative sedation for terminally ill], ''[[American Medical News]]'', 7 July 2008</ref><ref>[[American Medical Association]] (2008), Report of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs: [http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/369/ceja_5a08.pdf Sedation to Unconsciousness in End-of-Life Care]</ref>

=== Sweden ===
In October 2010 Svenska Läkaresällskapets, an association of physicians in Sweden, published guidelines which allowed for palliative sedation to be administered even with the intent of the patient not to reawaken.<ref>{{Cite news |author= Österberg, Lina |title= Sjuka får sövas in i döden |url= http://www.dagensmedicin.se/dagenssjukskoterska/nyheter/2010/10/11/sjuka-far-sovas-in-i-doden/index.xml |work= Dagens Medicin |language= Swedish |date= October 11, 2010 |accessdate= October 19, 2010}}</ref>
