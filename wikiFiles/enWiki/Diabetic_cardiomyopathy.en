'''Diabetic cardiomyopathy''' is a disorder of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]] in people with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. It can lead to inability of the heart to circulate blood through the body effectively, a state known as [[heart failure]], with accumulation of fluid in the [[lung]]s ([[pulmonary edema]]) or [[human leg|legs]] ([[peripheral edema]]). Most heart failure in people with diabetes results from [[coronary artery disease]], and diabetic cardiomyopathy is only said to exist if there is ''no'' coronary artery disease to explain the heart muscle disorder.<ref name="pmid15094099">{{cite journal |author=Avogaro A, Vigili de Kreutzenberg S, Negut C, Tiengo A, Scognamiglio R |title=Diabetic cardiomyopathy: a metabolic perspective |journal=Am.

==Signs and symptoms==
One particularity of DCM is the long latent phase, during which the disease progresses but is completely asymptomatic. In most cases, DCM is detected with concomitant [[hypertension]] or coronary artery disease. One of the earliest signs is mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with little effect on ventricular filling. Also, the diabetic patient may show subtle signs of DCM related to decreased left ventricular [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]] or left ventricular hypertrophy or a combination of both. A prominent “a” wave can also be noted in the [[jugular]] venous pulse, and the cardiac apical impulse may be overactive or sustained throughout [[Systole (medicine)|systole]]. After the development of systolic dysfunction, left ventricular dilation and symptomatic [[heart failure]], the jugular venous pressure may become elevated, the apical impulse would be displaced downward and to the left. Systolic mitral murmur is not uncommon in these cases. These changes are accompanied by a variety of electrocardiographic changes that
may be associated with DCM in 60% of patients without structural heart disease, although usually not in the early asymptomatic phase. Later in the progression, a prolonged [[QT interval]] may be indicative of fibrosis. Given that DCM’s definition excludes concomitant [[atherosclerosis]] or hypertension, there are no changes in perfusion or in [[atrial natriuretic peptide]] levels up until the very late stages of the disease,<ref name="pmid8174447">{{cite journal |author=Ferri C, Piccoli A, Laurenti O, ''et al.'' |title=Atrial natriuretic factor in hypertensive and normotensive diabetic patients |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=195–200 |year=1994 |month=March |pmid=8174447 |doi= 10.2337/diacare.17.3.195}}</ref> when the hypertrophy and fibrosis become very pronounced.

While it has been evident for a long time that the complications seen in diabetes are related to the [[hyperglycemia]] associated to it, several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Etiologically, four main causes are responsible for the development of heart failure in DCM: microangiopathy and related endothelial dysfunction, autonomic neuropathy, metabolic alterations that include abnormal glucose use and increased fatty acid oxidation, generation and accumulation of free radicals, and alterations in ion homeostasis, especially calcium transients.

===Microangiopathy===
Microangiopathy can be characterized as subendothelial and endothelial fibrosis in the [[coronary]] microvasculature of the heart. This endothelial dysfunction leads to impaired myocardial blood flow reserve as evidence by [[echocardiography]].<ref name="pmid16606865">{{cite journal |author=Moir S, Hanekom L, Fang ZY, ''et al.'' |title=Relationship between myocardial perfusion and dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy: a study of quantitative contrast echocardiography and strain rate imaging |journal=Heart |volume=92 |issue=10 |pages=1414–9 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16606865 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2005.079350 |pmc=1861031}}</ref> About 50% of diabetics with DCM show pathologic evidence for microangiopathy such as sub-endothelial and endothelial fibrosis, compared to only 21% of non-diabetic heart failure patients.<ref name="pmid4263660">{{cite journal |author=Rubler S, Dlugash J, Yuceoglu YZ, Kumral T, Branwood AW, Grishman A |title=New type of cardiomyopathy associated with diabetic glomerulosclerosis

Over the years, several hypotheses were postulated to explain the endothelial dysfunction observed in diabetes. It was hypothesized that the extracellular hyperglycemia leads to an intracellular hyperglycemia in cells unable to regulate their glucose uptake, most predominantly, endothelial cells. Indeed, while [[hepatocytes]] and [[myocytes]] have mechanisms allowing them to internalize their [[glucose]] transporter, endothelial cells do not possess this ability. 
The consequences of increased intracellular glucose concentration are fourfold, all resulting from increasing concentration of [[glycolytic]] intermediates upstream of the rate-limiting [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] reaction which is inhibited by mechanisms activated by increased free radical formation, common in diabetes.<ref name="pmid11050244">{{cite journal |author=Du XL, Edelstein D, Rossetti L, ''et al.'' |title=Hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial superoxide overproduction activates the hexosamine pathway and induces plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression by increasing Sp1 glycosylation |journal=Proc.

First, it has been widely reported since the 1960s that hyperglycemia causes an increase in the flux through [[aldose reductase]] and the polyol pathway. Increased activity of the detoxifying aldose reductase enzyme leads to a depletion of the essential [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] [[NADH]], thereby disrupting crucial cell processes.<ref name="pmid9872926">{{cite journal |author=Lee AY, Chung SS |title=Contributions of polyol pathway to oxidative stress in diabetic cataract |journal=FASEB J. |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=23–30 |year=1999 |month=January |pmid=9872926 |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9872926}}</ref> Second, increasing [[fructose 6-phosphate]], a glycolysis intermediate, will lead to increased flux through the [[hexosamine]] pathway. This produces [[N-acetyl glucosamine]] that can add on [[serine]] and [[threonine]] residues and alter signaling pathways as well as cause pathological induction of certain transcription factors.<ref name="pmid11050244" /> Third, hyperglycemia causes an increase in [[diacylglycerol]], which is also an activator of the [[Protein Kinase C]] (PKC) signaling pathway. Induction of PKC causes multiple deleterious effects, including but not limited to blood flow abnormalities, [[capillary]] occlusion and pro-inflammatory gene expression.<ref name="pmid9604860">{{cite journal |author=Koya D, King GL |title=Protein kinase C activation and the development of diabetic complications |journal=Diabetes |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=859–66 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9604860 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.47.6.859
|url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9604860}}</ref> Finally, [[glucose]], as well as other intermediates such as fructose and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, when present in high concentrations, promote the formation of [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s (AGEs).

===Myocardial metabolic abnormalities===
Possibly one of the first difference alteration noticed in diabetic hearts were metabolic derangements. Indeed, even in the 1950s, it was recognized that cardiac myocyte from a diabetic patient had an abnormal, energy-inefficient metabolic function, with almost no carbohydrate oxidation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=UNGAR I, GILBERT M, SIEGEL A, BLAIN JM, BING RJ |title=Studies on myocardial metabolism. IV. Myocardial metabolism in diabetes |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=385–96 |year=1955 |month=March |pmid=14349963 |doi= 10.1016/0002-9343(55)90218-7|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0002-9343(55)90218-7}}</ref> The changes seen in DCM are not dissimilar to those of [[ischemia]], and might explain why diabetics are more susceptible to ischemic damage, and are not easily preconditioned. Further, diabetes leads to a persistent hyperglycemia very often accompanied by a hyperlipidemia. This alters substrate availability to the heart and surely affects its [[metabolism]].

Under normal conditions, fatty acids are the preferred substrate in the adult myocardium, supplying up to 70% of total [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Mulder, G. & Visscher, B. |title= The carbohydrate metabolism of the heart |journal= American Journal of Physiology |volume=94 |pages=630–640 |year=1930 |url=http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/content/94/3/630.full.pdf |issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author= Bing RJ, Siegel A, Ungar I, Gilbert M |title= Metabolism of the human heart : II.

Substrate choice in the adult heart is mainly regulated by availability, energy demand and oxygen supply ([[Randle cycle]]/[[Glucose fatty-acid cycle]]). Therefore, it is not surprising that alterations are present in diabetes and contribute greatly to its pathogenesis. Cardiomyocytes, unlike endothelial cells, have the ability to regulate their glucose uptake. Thus, they are mostly spared from the complications associated with hyperglycemia that plague endothelial cells. In order to protect themselves from the extracellular hyperglycemia, cardiac cells can internalize their insulin-dependent glucose transporter, [[GLUT4]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li SH, McNeill JH |title=''In vivo'' effects of vanadium on GLUT4 translocation in cardiac tissue of STZ-diabetic rats |journal=Molecular and cellular biochemistry |volume=217 |issue=1-2 |pages=121–9 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11269655 |doi= 10.1023/A:1007224828753|url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0300-8177&volume=217&page=121}}</ref> When looking at the [[carbohydrate]] utilization of the myocardium, diabetic hearts not only show a decrease in glucose utilization but also a very pronounced decrease in lactate utilization, to a greater extent than glucose utilization.

However, as a downside to this decrease glucose uptake, cardiomyocytes are faced with a reduced glucose oxidation rate and a dramatically increased fatty acid β-oxidation to almost 100% of ATP production.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oliver MF, Opie LH |title=Effects of glucose and fatty acids on myocardial ischaemia and arrhythmias |journal=Lancet |volume=343 |issue=8890 |pages=155–8 |year=1994 |month=January |pmid=7904009 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90939-3}}</ref> This is translated into a dramatic increase of fatty acid transporter, especially [[CD36]] that is postulated to have an important role in the [[etiology]] of cardiac disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Finck BN, Han X, Courtois M, ''et al.'' |title=A critical role for PPARalpha-mediated lipotoxicity in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy: modulation by dietary fat content |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=1226–31 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12552126
|pmc=298755 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0336724100 }}</ref> Interestingly, it seems that the decrease in carbohydrate oxidation precedes the appearance of hyperglycemia in type II diabetes. It is likely due to the increased β-oxidation due to the hyperlipidemia and altered [[insulin]] signaling.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aasum E, Hafstad AD, Severson DL, Larsen TS |title=Age-dependent changes in metabolism, contractile function, and ischemic sensitivity in hearts from db/db mice |journal=Diabetes |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=434–41 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12540618 |doi= 10.2337/diabetes.52.2.434|url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12540618}}</ref> The rate of uptake of lipids, unlike that of glucose, is not regulated by a hormone.

Increasing triglyceride stores prevent [[lipotoxicity]] but decrease heart function.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhou YT, Grayburn P, Karim A, ''et al.'' |title=Lipotoxic heart disease in obese rats: implications for human obesity |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=1784–9 |year=2000 |month=February |pmid=10677535 |pmc=26513 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.97.4.1784|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10677535}}</ref> 

Why are all those alterations detrimental to the heart? Emerging evidence supports the concept that alterations in metabolism contribute to cardiac contractile dysfunction.<ref name="pmid15573141"/><ref>Stanley WC, Recchia FA, Lopaschuk GD. Myocardial substrate metabolism in the normal and failing heart. Physiol Rev 2005 July;85(3):1093-129.</ref> In animal models, contractile failure begins as a diastolic dysfunction, and progresses occasionally to systolic dysfunction ultimately leading to heart failure.<ref name="pmid15573141"/> Normalizing energy metabolism in these hearts reversed the impaired contractility.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chatham JC, Forder JR |title=Relationship between cardiac function and substrate oxidation in hearts of diabetic rats |journal=Am.

</ref> During diabetes, metabolic remodeling precedes the cardiomyopathy<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buchanan J, Mazumder PK, Hu P, ''et al.'' |title=Reduced cardiac efficiency and altered substrate metabolism precedes the onset of hyperglycemia and contractile dysfunction in two mouse models of insulin resistance and obesity |journal=Endocrinology |volume=146 |issue=12 |pages=5341–9 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16141388 |doi=10.1210/en.2005-0938 |url=http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16141388}}</ref> and it is valid to hypothesize that these changes may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. Indeed, when treating animal models with metabolic modulators at an early age, prior to any sign of cardiomyopathy, improvements of heart function can be noted.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Golfman LS, Wilson CR, Sharma S, ''et al.'' |title=Activation of PPARgamma enhances myocardial glucose oxidation and improves contractile function in isolated working hearts of ZDF rats |journal=Am.

Metab. |volume=289 |issue=2 |pages=E328–36 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=15797988 |doi=10.1152/ajpendo.00055.2005 |url=http://ajpendo.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15797988}}</ref> Thus, it is
evident that metabolic derangements seen in DCM not only precede the pathology, but also contribute greatly to its development.

===Autonomic neuropathy===
While the heart can function without help from the [[nervous system]], it is highly innervated with [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic nerves]], regulating the heart beat according to demand in a fast manner, prior to hormonal release. The autonomic innervations of the myocardium in DCM are altered and contribute to myocardial dysfunction. Unlike the [[brain]], the peripheral nervous system does not benefit from a barrier protecting it from the circulating levels of glucose. Just like endothelial cells, nerve cells cannot regulate their glucose uptake and suffer the same type of damages listed above. Therefore, the diabetic heart shows clear [[denervation]] as the pathology progresses. This denervation correlates with echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction and results in a decline of survival in patients with diabetes from 85% to 44%. Other causes of denervation are ischemia from microvascular disease and thus appear following the development of microangiopathy.

===Altered ion homeostasis===
Unlike most other cell types, the heart has constantly and rapidly changing ionic status, with various ion currents going in out of the cell during each beat cycle. More importantly, [[calcium]] is a major player of cardiac electromechanical events, energy metabolism and contractile function.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cesario DA, Brar R, Shivkumar K |title=Alterations in ion channel physiology in diabetic cardiomyopathy |journal=Endocrinol.

North Am. |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=601–10, ix–x |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16959588 |doi=10.1016/j.ecl.2006.05.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0889-8529(06)00039-9}}</ref> It moves across the [[sarcolemma]], [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] and mitochondrial membranes through various [[organelle]] specific channels by [[active transport]] as well as [[passive diffusion]]. Around 30-40% of the ATP production of a cardiomyocyte is primarily used by the sarcoplasmic reticulum {{chem|Ca|2+}}-ATPase ([[SERCA]]) and other ion pumps.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Suga H |title=Ventricular energetics |journal=Physiol.

possibly its integrity and structure.

In DCM, such alterations have been noted since the late 80s.

==Treatment==

At present, there is not a single clinically effective treatment for diabetic cardiomyopathy. Treatment centers around intense glycemic control through diet, oral hypoglycemics and frequently insulin and management of heart failure symptoms. There is a clear correlation between increased glycemia and risk of developing diabetic cardiomyopathy, therefore, keeping glucose concentrations as controlled as possible is paramount.  Thiazolidinediones are not recommended in patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure secondary to fluid retention. 

As with most other heart diseases, [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE) inhibitors can also be administered. An analysis of major clinical trials shows that diabetic patients with heart failure benefit from such a therapy to a similar degree as non-diabetics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shekelle PG, Rich MW, Morton SC, ''et al.'' |title=Efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers in the management of left ventricular systolic dysfunction according to race, gender, and diabetic status: a meta-analysis of major clinical trials |journal=J.
