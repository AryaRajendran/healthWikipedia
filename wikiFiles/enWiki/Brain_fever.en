'''Brain fever''' describes a medical condition where a part of the brain becomes inflamed and causes symptoms that present as [[fever]].  The terminology is dated, and is encountered most often in [[Victorian literature]], where it typically describes a potentially life-threatening illness brought about by a severe emotional upset.  Conditions that may be described as brain fever include:

*[[Encephalitis]], an acute inflammation of the brain, commonly caused by a viral infection.
*[[Meningitis]], the inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.

In [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Arthur Conan Doyle's]] [[Sherlock Holmes]] story "[[The Adventure of the Crooked Man|The Crooked Man]]", the term is used to refer to a woman suffering from a state of shock when her husband has been murdered.  The term is also used in "[[The Naval Treaty]]", in ''[[The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes]]''; here it refers to Percy Phelps, an old schoolmate of Dr Watson’s, who was distraught after losing important diplomatic papers. He was so upset that he had a fit and went almost mad, before he “lay for over nine weeks, unconscious, and raving mad with brain fever.” Similarly, brain fever is also mentioned in the Holmes stories "[[The Adventure of the Copper Beeches]]", "[[The Adventure of the Cardboard Box]]" and "[[The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual]]". 

Brain fever is mentioned in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky's]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' which manifests itself into Ivan's nightmare of the devil in Part IV, Book XI, Chapter 9, "Anticipating events I can say at least one thing: he was at that moment on the very eve of an attack of brain fever. Though his health had long been affected, it had offered a stubborn resistance to the fever which in the end gained complete mastery over it." 
The terminology is also used in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''.

More recently, a technician accuses a robot of having "brain-fever" in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s 1945 short story "Escape," included in the 1950 collection "[[I, Robot]]".
