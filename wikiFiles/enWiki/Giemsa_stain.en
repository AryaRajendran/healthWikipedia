'''Giemsa stain''', named after [[Gustav Giemsa]], an early German microbiologist, is used in [[cytogenetics]] and for the histopathological diagnosis of [[malaria]] and other [[parasite]]s.<ref>Giemsa G (1904 Eine Vereinfachung und Vervollkommnung meiner Methylenblau-Eosin-Färbemethode zur Erzielung der Romanowsky-Nocht’schen Chromatinfärbung.

==Uses==
It is specific for the [[phosphate]] groups of [[DNA]] and attaches itself to regions of [[DNA]] where there are high amounts of [[adenine]]-[[thymine]] bonding. Giemsa stain is used in Giemsa banding, commonly called [[G-banding]], to stain [[chromosome]]s and often used to create an [[idiogram]]. It can identify chromosomal aberrations such as [[chromosomal translocation|translocations]] and [[chromosomal inversion|rearrangements]].

Giemsa stain is also a [[Differential staining|differential stain]]. It can be used to study the adherence of [[pathogenic]] bacteria to human cells. It differentially stains human and bacterial cells purple and pink respectively. It can be used for [[histopathology|histopathological]] diagnosis of [[malaria]]<ref name="pmid17712779">{{cite journal |author=Shapiro HM, Mandy F |title=Cytometry in malaria: moving beyond Giemsa |journal=Cytometry.

It is also used in [[Wolbach's tissue stain]].

Giemsa stain is a classic [[blood film]] stain for [[peripheral blood smear]]s and [[bone marrow]] specimens. [[Erythrocyte]]s stain pink, [[platelet]]s show a light pale pink, [[lymphocyte]] [[cytoplasm]] stains sky blue, [[monocyte]] cytoplasm stains pale blue, and [[leukocyte]] nuclear [[chromatin]] stains magenta.

Giemsa stain is also used to visualize [[chromosome]]s.

Giemsa stains the fungus [[histoplasma]], [[Chlamydia_(bacterium)|chlamydia]] bacteria, and can be used to identify [[Mast cell]]s.<ref name="pmid9164634">{{cite journal |author=Damsgaard TE, Olesen AB, Sørensen FB, Thestrup-Pedersen K, Schiøtz PO |title=Mast cells and atopic dermatitis.

==Generation==

Giemsa's solution is a mixture of [[methylene blue]], [[eosin]], and [[azure B]]. The stain is usually prepared from commercially available Giemsa powder. 

A thin film of the specimen on a microscope slide is fixed in pure [[methanol]] for 30 seconds, by immersing it or by putting a few drops of methanol on the slide. The slide is immersed in a freshly prepared 5% Giemsa stain solution for 20–30 minutes (in emergencies 5–10 minutes in 10% solution can be used), then flushed with tap water and left to dry.<ref name="url4.2.2.2">{{cite web |url=http://www.impact-malaria.com/FR/EPS/Formations_et_cours_internationaux/Formation_de_la_Liverpool_School_LSTMH/cours_liverpool/Unit_4/4_2_2_2.html |title=4.2.2.2 |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>
