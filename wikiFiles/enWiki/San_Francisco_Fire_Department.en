The '''San Francisco Fire Department''' ('''SFFD''') provides [[fire]] and [[emergency medical services]] to the City and County of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]].

The San Francisco Fire Department, along with the [[San Francisco Police Department]] and [[San Francisco Sheriff's Department]], serves an estimated population of 1.4 million people (which includes the approximately 850,000 citizens residing in the {{convert|47.5|sqmi|km2}} of San Francisco (including [[Treasure Island]], [[Yerba Buena Island]] and the [[Presidio of San Francisco]]), the daytime-commuter population, and the thousands of other visitors, tourists, and others present in the city every day) with approximately 1,700 firefighting and emergency medical field personnel. The department responds to, on average, approximately 73,000 emergency calls annually, with over 80% being emergency medical calls.

==History==
Volunteer companies were first formed in the city in 1850, and a paid staff established in 1866. In 1906, the department was considered on a par with those of the larger cities on the East Coast, but found itself reduced to fighting the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake#Subsequent fires|fire of 1906]] in the quake aftermath with axes and shovels, as most of the city's water mains were broken and [[cistern]]s drained. Fire Chief Dennis Sullivan was killed in his home by a falling chimney early in the disaster.

==In popular culture==
*The SFFD was the responding fire department to a major high-rise fire disaster in the 1974 film, ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''. The film cast many actual firefighters from the department and used many actual SFFD fire trucks during the filming. Fire Station # 38 was also shown in the filming. The exterior shots were done at the Bank of America Building, 555 California.
*The SFFD was also used in the ''[[Dirty Harry (film)|Dirty Harry]]'' film series, particularly Rescue Squad 2 in ''[[Dirty Harry]]''.
*When a veteran SFFD firefighter is killed and [[Adrian Monk]] is blinded in a mysterious attack at a firehouse in the ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' episode "[[Mr. Monk Can't See a Thing]]," Monk must rely on his other senses to solve the bizarre case. In the course of the episode, he finds that the killer came to the firehouse to steal a fireman's coat and even finds that the man who blinded him had just beforehand killed a woman a few blocks away and set fire to her house (said fire was the one the engine company had been responding to when the murder at the firehouse took place). The depicted fire station, Fire Station 53, is a fictitious station. The exterior of the station was represented by Fire Station 1 of the [[Los Angeles Fire Department]].
*In the ''Monk'' novel series by [[Lee Goldberg]], Joe Cochran, [[Natalie Teeger]]'s occasional lover, is an SFFD firefighter, making appearances in the novels ''[[Mr. Monk Goes to the Firehouse]]'', ''[[Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants]]'', and ''[[Mr. Monk in Outer Space]]''.
*The SFFD was featured in two ''[[Emergency!]]'' television movies in 1978 and 1979, where L.A. County Firefighter/Paramedics Gage and DeSoto run calls with the firefighters of Rescue Squad 2.
*The NBC Television show ''[[Trauma (TV series)|Trauma]]'' followed the fiction lives of SFFD paramedics, EMTs and flight medics.
*The department is featured in the 1985 James Bond film [[A View to a Kill]]. After San Francisco City Hall is set ablaze by the villainous Max Zorin in an attempt to kill James; the SFFD arrives on scene and assists Roger Moore's character in escaping the burning building and then ultimately "borrows" a SFFD ladder truck in order to outrun the police officers chasing him on the suspicion that his character set the blaze.
