'''Lymphoid leukemia''' or '''lymphocytic leukemia''' is a type of [[leukemia]] affecting circulating [[lymphocyte]] cells.  This is in contrast to [[lymphoma]], which is a solid tumor of the same type of cells.<ref name="isbn0-8153-4093-1">{{cite book |author=Parham, Peter |title=The immune system |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=0-8153-4093-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=414}}</ref>

Lymphocytes are a subtype of [[white blood cell]]s.  Most lymphoid leukemias involve a particular subtype of lymphocytes, the [[B cell]].

==Classification==
Historically, they have been most commonly divided by the stage of maturation at which the clonal (neoplastic) lymphoid population stopped maturing:
* [[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia]]
* [[Chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]

However, the influential WHO Classification (published in 2001) emphasized a greater emphasis on cell lineage. To this end, lymphoid leukemias can also be divided by the type of cells affected:
* [[B-cell leukemia]]
* [[T-cell leukemia]]
* [[NK-cell leukemia]]

The most common type of lymphoid leukemia is [[B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].

''T-cell leukemia'' describes several different types of lymphoid leukemias which affect [[T cell]]s.

The most common T-cell leukemia is [[precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia]].<ref name=Robbins12-8/> It causes 15% of acute leukemias in childhood, and also 40% of lymphomas in childhood.<ref name=Robbins12-8/> It is most common in [[adolescent]] males.<ref name=Robbins12-8/> Its morphology is identical to that of ''precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia''.<ref name=Robbins12-8/> Cell markers include TdT, [[CD2]], [[CD7]].<ref name=Robbins12-8/> It often presents as a [[mediastinal mass]] because of involvement of the [[thymus]].<ref name=Robbins12-8/> It is highly associated with [[NOTCH1]] mutations.<ref name=Robbins12-8/>

Other types include:
* [[Large granular lymphocytic leukemia]]
* [[Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma]]
* [[T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia]]

In practice, it can be hard to distinguish T-cell leukemia from [[T-cell lymphoma]], and they are often grouped together.
