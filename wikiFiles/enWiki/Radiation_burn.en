A '''radiation burn''' is damage to the [[skin]] or other [[biological tissue]] caused by exposure to radiation. The radiation types of greatest concern are [[thermal radiation]], radio frequency energy, [[ultraviolet light]] and [[ionizing radiation]].

The most common type of radiation [[burn]] is a [[sunburn]] caused by [[ultraviolet light|UV radiation]]. High exposure to [[X-rays]] during diagnostic [[medical imaging]] or [[radiotherapy]] can also result in radiation burns. As the ionizing radiation interacts with [[cell (biology)|cells]] within the body—damaging them—the body responds to this damage, typically resulting in [[erythema]]—that is, redness around the damaged area. Radiation burns are often associated with [[radiation-induced cancer]] due to the ability of ionizing radiation to interact with and damage [[DNA]], occasionally inducing a cell to become cancerous. [[Cavity magnetron]]s can be improperly used to create surface and internal burning. Depending on the [[photon]] [[energy]], [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] can cause very deep '''gamma burns''', with [[cobalt-60|<sup>60</sup>Co]] internal burns are common. '''Beta burns''' tend to be shallow as [[beta particles]] are not able to penetrate deep into the person; these burns can be similar to sunburn.

Radiation burns can also occur with high power [[radio transmitter]]s at any frequency where the body absorbs radio frequency energy and converts it to heat.<ref>[http://www.arrl.org/news/rfsafety/ ARRL: RF Exposure Regulations News]</ref> The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) considers 50 watts to be the lowest power above which radio stations must evaluate emission safety. Frequencies considered especially dangerous occur where the human body can become [[resonance|resonant]], at 35&nbsp;MHz, 70&nbsp;MHz, 80-100&nbsp;MHz, 400&nbsp;MHz, and 1&nbsp;GHz.<ref>[http://www.arrl.org/news/rfsafety/hbkrf.html ARRL: RF Radiation and Electromagnetic Field Safety]</ref> Exposure to [[microwave]]s of too high intensity can cause [[microwave burn]]s.

With interventional fluoroscopy, because of the high skin [[absorbed dose|dose]]s that can be generated in the course of the intervention, some procedures have resulted in early (less than two months after exposure) and/or late (two months or more after exposure) skin reactions, including necrosis in some cases.<ref name="pmid10580952">{{cite journal |title=Severe skin reactions from interventional fluoroscopy: case report and review of the literature |journal=Radiology |volume=213 |issue=3 |pages=773–6 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=10580952 |doi= |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10580952 |last1=Wagner |first1=LK |last2=McNeese |first2=MD |last3=Marx |first3=MV |last4=Siegel |first4=EL}}</ref>{{rp|773}}

== Beta burns ==
"Beta burns" are shallow surface [[burn]]s, usually of [[skin]] and less often of [[lung]]s or [[gastrointestinal tract]], caused by [[beta particles]], typically from [[hot particle]]s or dissolved [[radionuclide]]s that came to direct contact with or close proximity to the body. They can appear similar to [[sunburn]]. Unlike [[gamma ray]]s, beta emissions are stopped much more effectively by materials and therefore deposit all their energy in only a shallow layer of tissue, causing more intense but more localized damage. On cellular level, the changes in skin are similar to [[radiodermatitis]].

High doses of radiation can cause rapid browning of skin, known as "nuclear tan".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The dose is influenced by relatively low penetration of beta emissions through materials. The cornified [[keratine]] layer of [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] has enough stopping power to absorb beta radiation with energies lower than 70 keV. Further protection is provided by clothing, especially [[shoe]]s. The dose is further reduced by limited retention of radioactive particles on skin; a 1 millimeter particle is typically released in 2 hours, while a 50 micrometer particle usually does not adhere for more than 7 hours. Beta emissions are also severely attenuated by air; their range generally does not exceed {{convert|6|ft|m}} and intensity rapidly diminishes with distance.<ref name="medmagrad">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Y-k5h07NkFcC&pg=PA77&dq=%22beta+burns%22&cd=7#v=onepage&q=%22beta%20burns%22&f=false |title=Medical management of radiation accidents|author=Igor A.

Beta burns can occur also to [[plant]]s.

Careful washing of exposed body surface, removing the radioactive particles, may provide significant dose reduction. Exchanging or at least brushing off clothes also provides a degree of protection.

If the exposition to beta radiation is intense, the beta burns may first manifest in 24–48 hours by itching and/or burning sensation that last for one or two days, sometimes accompanied by [[hyperaemia]]. After 1–3 weeks burn symptoms appear; [[erythema]], increased [[skin pigmentation]] (dark colored patches and raised areas), followed by [[epilation]] and [[skin lesion]]s. Erythema occurs after 5–15 [[gray (unit)|Gy]], dry desquamation after 17 Gy, and [[bullous]] [[epidermitis]] after 72 Gy.<ref name="medmagrad"/> [[Chronic radiation keratosis]] may develop after higher doses. Primary erythema lasting more than 72 hours is an indication of injury severe enough to cause chronic radiation dermatitis. Edema of [[dermal papillae]], if present within 48 hours since the exposition, is followed by transepidermal [[necrosis]]. After higher doses, the [[malpighian layer]] cells die within 24 hours; lower doses may take 10–14 days to show dead cells.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8fXzJrDfFgUC&pg=PA690&dq=fallout+particles+morphology&cd=20#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Veterinary pathology|page=690|author=Thomas Carlyle Jones, Ronald Duncan Hunt, Norval W.

* In first degree beta burns the damage is largely limited to [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. Dry or wet [[desquamation]] occurs; dry [[Wound healing#Proliferative phase|scabs]] are formed, then heal rapidly, leaving a depigmented area surrounded with irregular area of increased pigmentation. The skin pigmentation returns to normal within several weeks.
* Second degree beta burns lead to formation of [[blister]]s.
* Third and fourth degree beta burns result in deeper, wet [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]ated lesions, which heal with routine medical care after covering themselves with dry scab. In case of heavy tissue damage, ulcerated [[necrotic]] [[dermatitis]] may occur. Pigmentation may return to normal within several months after wound healing.<ref name="medmagrad"/>

As shown, the dose thresholds for symptoms vary by source and even individually. In practice, determining the exact dose tends to be difficult.

Similar effects apply to animals, with fur acting as additional factor for both increased particle retention and partial skin shielding. Unshorn thickly wooled sheep are well protected; while the epilation threshold for sheared sheep is between 23–47 Gy (2500–5000 [[Roentgen equivalent physical|rep]]) and the threshold for normally wooled face is 47–93 Gy (5000–10000 rep), for thickly wooled (33mm hair length) sheep it is 93–140 Gy (10000–15000 rep). To produce skin lesions comparable with [[orf (disease)|contagious pustular dermatitis]], the estimated dose is between 465–1395 Gy.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=gzsrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA224&dq=%22beta+burns%22+plants&cd=3#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=A guide to environmental research on animals|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

=== Energy vs penetration depth ===
{{Medium-lived fission products}}
The effects depend on both the intensity and the energy of the radiation. Low-energy beta (sulfur-35, 170 keV) produces shallow ulcers with little damage to dermis, while [[cobalt-60]] (310 keV), [[caesium-137]] (550 keV), [[phosphorus-32]] (1.71 MeV), [[strontium-90]] (650 keV) and its daughter product [[yttrium-90]] (2.3 MeV) damage deeper levels of the [[dermis]] and can result in [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[radiation dermatitis]]. Very high energies from [[electron beam]]s from [[particle accelerator]]s, reaching tens of megaelectronvolts, can be deeply penetrating. Conversely, megavolt-scale beams can deposit their energy deeper with less damage to the dermis; modern [[radiotherapy]] [[electron beam]] [[particle accelerator|accelerators]] take advantage of this. At yet higher energies, above 16 MeV, the effect does not show significantly anymore, limiting the usefulness of higher energies for radiotherapy. As a convention, surface is defined as the topmost 0.5&nbsp;mm of skin.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=v68J1dgCEn8C&pg=PA522&dq=radiotherapy+electron+beam+penetration+depth+mev&cd=5#v=onepage&q=radiotherapy%20electron%20beam%20penetration%20depth%20mev&f=false|page=522 |title=Handbook of radiotherapy physics: theory and practice|author=Philip Mayles, Alan E. Nahum, Jean-Claude Rosenwald|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=0-7503-0860-5}}</ref> High-energy beta emissions should be shielded with plastic instead of lead, as [[heavy metal (chemistry)|high-Z]] elements generate deeply penetrating gamma [[bremsstrahlung]].

The electron energies from [[beta decay]] are not discrete but form a continuous spectrum with a cutoff at maximum energy. The rest of the energy of each decay is carried off by an [[antineutrino]] which does not significantly interact and therefore does not contribute to the dose. Most energies of beta emissions are at about a third of the maximum energy.<ref name="google1"/> Beta emissions have much lower energies than what is achievable from particle accelerators, no more than few megaelectronvolts.

The energy-depth-dose profile is a curve starting with a surface dose, ascending to the maximum dose in a certain depth d<sub>m</sub> (usually normalized as 100% dose), then descends slowly through depths of 90% dose (d<sub>90</sub>) and 80% dose (d<sub>80</sub>), then falls off linearly and relatively sharply though depth of 50% dose (d<sub>50</sub>). The extrapolation of this linear part of the curve to zero defines the maximum electron range, R<sub>p</sub>. In practice, there is a long tail of weaker but deep dose, called "bremsstrahlung tail", attributable to [[bremsstrahlung]]. The penetration depth depends also on beam shape, narrower beam tend to have less penetration. In water, broad electron beams, as is the case in homogeneous surface contamination of skin, have d<sub>80</sub> about E/3&nbsp;cm and R<sub>p</sub> about E/2&nbsp;cm, where E is the beta particle energy in MeV.<ref name="cliradphys">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=y3s0mI_BmZ4C&pg=PA328&dq=accelerator+burns+electron&cd=37#v=onepage&q=accelerator%20burns%20electron&f=false|page=328 |title=Handbook of urology: diagnosis and therapy|author=Mike Benjamin Siroky, Robert D. Oates, Richard K. Babayan|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2004|isbn=0-7817-4221-8}}</ref>

The penetration depth of lower-energy beta in water (and soft tissues) is about 2&nbsp;mm/MeV. For a 2.3 MeV beta the maximum depth in water is 11&nbsp;mm, for 1.1 MeV it is 4.6&nbsp;mm. The depth where maximum of the energy is deposited is significantly lower.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scidemos/QuantumRelativity/PenetrationandShielding/PenetrationandShielding.html |title=α, β, γ Penetration and Shielding |publisher=Fas.harvard.edu |date= }}</ref>

== Causes ==
Radiation burns are caused by exposure to high levels of radiation. Levels high enough to cause burn are generally lethal if received as a whole-body dose, whereas they may be treatable if received as a shallow or local dose.

=== Radioactive fallout ===
Beta burns are frequently the result of exposure to [[radioactive fallout]] after [[nuclear explosion]]s or [[nuclear accident]]s. Shortly after the explosion, the [[fission product]]s have very high beta activity, with about two beta emissions per each [[gamma]] photon.

After the [[Trinity test]], the fallout caused localized burns on the backs of [[cattle]] in the area downwind.<ref name="massburns">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=sDQrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA248&dq=%22beta+burns%22&cd=5#v=onepage&q=%22beta%20burns%22&f=false |page=248|title=Mass burns: proceedings of a workshop, 13–14 March 1968|author=National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Fire Research, United States. Office of Civil Defense|publisher=National Academies|year=1969}}</ref> The fallout had the appearance of small flaky dust particles. The cattle showed temporary burns, bleeding, and loss of hair. Dogs were also affected; in addition to localized burns on their backs, they also had burned paws, likely from the particles lodged between their toes as hoofed animals did not show problems with feet. About 350–600 cattle were affected by superficial burns and localized temporary loss of dorsal hair; the army later bought 75 most affected cows as the discolored regrown hair lowered their market value.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H2EzvHupWRkC&pg=PA105&dq=%22beta+burns%22&cd=17#v=onepage&q=%22beta%20burns%22&f=false|page=105 |title=The dragon's tail: radiation safety in the Manhattan Project, 1942-1946|author=Barton C.

The fallout produced by the [[Castle Bravo]] test was unexpectedly strong. A white snow-like dust, nicknamed by the scientists "Bikini snow" and consisting of contaminated crushed [[calcined]] [[coral]], fell for about 12 hours upon the [[Rongelap Atoll]], depositing layer of up to 2&nbsp;cm. Residents suffered beta burns, mostly on the backs of their necks and on their feet,<ref name="massburns"/> and were resettled after three days. 
After 24–48 hours their skin was itching and burning; in a day or two the sensations subsided, to be followed after 2–3 weeks by epilation and ulcers. Darker-colored patches and raised areas appeared on their skin, blistering was uncommon. Ulcers formed dry scabs and healed. Deeper lesions, painful, weeping and ulcerated, formed on more contaminated residents; majority healed with simple treatment. In general, the beta burns healed with some cutaneous [[scarring]] and depigmentation. Individuals who bathed and washed the fallout particles from their skin did not develop skin lesions.<ref name="nuchandb">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=CAUYAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA18&dq=%22beta+burns%22&cd=65#v=onepage&q=%22beta%20burns%22&f=false |title=Nuclear handbook for medical service personnel|author=United States.

Sixteen crew members of the aircraft carrier [[USS Bairoko (CVE-115)|USS Bairoko]] received beta burns and there was an increased [[cancer]] rate.<ref name="medmagrad"/>

During the Zebra test of the [[Operation Sandstone]] in 1948 three men suffered beta burns on their hands when removing sample collection filters from [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] flying through the [[mushroom cloud]]; their estimated skin surface dose was 28 to 149 Gy and their disfigured hands required [[skin graft]]s.

The [[Upshot-Knothole Harry]] test at the [[Frenchman Flat]] site released large amount of fallout. Significant amount of sheep died after [[grazing]] on contaminated areas. The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|AEC]] however had policy to compensate farmers only for animals showing external beta burns, so many claims were denied. Other tests on the Nevada Test Site also caused fallout and corresponding beta burns to sheep, horses and cattle.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eQfG-U5iAPYC&pg=PA65&dq=%22beta+burns%22&cd=55#v=onepage&q=%22beta%20burns%22&f=false |page=65|title=Bombs in the backyard: atomic testing and American politics|author=A.

=== Nuclear accidents ===
Beta burns were a serious medical issue for some victims of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]; from 115 patients treated in Moscow, 30% had burns covering 10–50% of body surface, 11% were affected on 50–100% of skin; the massive [[Ionizing radiation|exposure]] was often caused by clothes drenched with radioactive water. Some firefighters suffered beta burns of [[lung]]s and [[nasopharyngeal]] region after inhalation of massive amounts of radioactive [[smoke]]. Out of 28 deaths, 16 had skin injuries listed among the causes. The beta activity was extremely high, with beta/gamma ratio reaching 10–30 and beta energy high enough to damage [[basal layer]] of the skin, resulting in large area portals for [[infection]]s, exacerbated by damage to [[bone marrow]] and weakened [[immune system]]. Some patients received skin dose of 400–500 Gy. The infections caused more than half of the acute deaths. Several died of fourth degree beta burns between 9–28 days after dose of 6–16 Gy. Seven died after dose of 4–6 Gy and third degree beta burns in 4–6 weeks. One died later from second degree beta burns and dose 1-4 Gy.<ref name="radhorm"/> The survivors have [[atrophic]] skin which is [[telangiectasia|telangiectactic]] and with underlying [[fibrosis]].<ref name="medmagrad"/>

The burns may manifest at different times at different body areas. The Chernobyl liquidators burns first appeared on wrists, face, neck and feet, followed by chest and back, then by knees, hips and buttocks.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qKPofdNV2C8C&pg=PA174&dq=%22beta+burns%22&cd=6#v=onepage&q=%22beta%20burns%22&f=false|page=174 |title=Bioterrorism: psychological and public health interventions|author=Robert J.

[[Industrial radiography]] sources are a common source of beta burns in workers.

[[Radiation therapy]] sources can cause beta burns during [[Ionizing radiation|exposure]] of the patients. The sources can be also lost and mishandled, as in the [[Goiânia accident]], during which several people suffered external beta burns and more serious gamma burns, and several died. Numerous accidents also occur during radiotherapy due to equipment failures, operator errors, or wrong dosage.

[[Electron beam]] sources and [[particle accelerator]]s can be also sources of beta burns.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=7396251|journal=Ann Emerg Med|year=1980|volume=9|title=Accidental beta radiation burns from an electron accelerator|author=Burguieres TH, Stair T, Rolnick MA, Mossman KL|issue=7|doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(80)80115-6|pages=371–3}}</ref> The burns may be fairly deep and require [[skin graft]]s, tissue [[Segmental resection|resection]] or even [[amputation]] of fingers or limbs.<ref>{{cite journal|title=High Energy Electron Injury from Accelerator Machines (Cathode Rays): Radiation Burns of Chest Wall and Neck: 17-Year Follow Up of Atomic Burns|author=J.
