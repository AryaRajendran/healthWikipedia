'''Eradication''' is the reduction of an [[infectious disease]]'s [[prevalence]] in the [[Earth|global]] [[host (biology)|host]] population to zero.<ref name="Dowdle">{{cite journal |author=Dowdle, Walter R |title=The Principles of Disease Elimination and Eradication |journal=[[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]] |volume=76 |issue=S2 |pages=22–25 |year=1998 |pmid= |accessdate=2010-07-13 }} http://whqlibdoc.who.int/bulletin/1998/supplement2/bulletin_1998_76(supp2)_13-32.pdf</ref> It is sometimes confused with '''elimination''', which describes either the reduction of an infectious disease's prevalence in a regional population to zero, or the reduction of the global prevalence to a negligible amount.  Further confusion arises from the use of the term eradication to refer to the total removal of a given [[pathogen]] from an individual  (also known as clearance of an [[infection]]), particularly in the context of [[HIV]] and certain other [[virus]]es where such cures are sought.

Eight attempts have been made to date to eradicate infectious diseases—two successful programs targeting [[smallpox]] and [[rinderpest]], two ongoing programs targeting [[poliomyelitis]] and [[dracunculiasis]], and four aborted programs targeting [[hookworm]], [[malaria]], [[yaws]], and [[yellow fever]].  Five more infectious diseases have been identified as of April 2008 as potentially eradicable with current technology by the [[Carter Center]] International Task Force for Disease Eradication—[[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]], [[lymphatic filariasis]] and [[cysticercosis]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/itfde/updated_disease_candidate_table.pdf | title = Diseases considered as candidates for global eradication by the International Task Force for Disease Eradication | publisher=Cartercenter.org | accessdate=2011-03-16 }}</ref>

==Eradicated==

So far, two diseases have been successfully eradicated—one specifically affecting humans (smallpox), and one affecting a wide range of [[ruminants]] (rinderpest).

===Smallpox===
{{Main| Smallpox}}
Smallpox is the first disease, and so far the only infectious disease of humans, to have been eradicated by human undertakings. It became the first disease for which there was an effective [[vaccination]] when [[Edward Jenner]] demonstrated in 1798 that [[inoculation]] of humans with [[cowpox]] could protect against [[smallpox]].<ref name="WHO-smallpox">{{cite web |year=2000 |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/|title = Smallpox |publisher= [[World Health Organization|WHO]] |accessdate= 2007-11-30 }}</ref>

The virus causing smallpox, ''Variola vera'', has two variants: ''variola major'', with a mortality rate around 30 percent, and ''variola minor'', with a mortality rate less than 1 percent. The last naturally occurring case of ''variola major'' was diagnosed in October 1975 in [[Bangladesh]], and the last naturally occurring case of ''variola minor'' was diagnosed in October 1977 in [[Somalia]]. The global eradication of smallpox was certified by a commission of scientists on December 9, 1979 and endorsed by the World Health Assembly on May 8, 1980.<ref name="WHO-smallpox"/>

===Rinderpest===
{{Main| Rinderpest}}
During the 20th century, there were a series of campaigns to eradicate [[rinderpest]], a viral disease which infected cattle and other ruminants and belonged to the same family as [[measles]], primarily through the use of a live attenuated vaccine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dennis Normile |title=Driven to Extinction |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=319 |pages=1606–1609 |year=2008 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/319/5870/1606 |pmid=18356500 |accessdate= 2009-03-28 |issue= 5870|doi=10.1126/science.319.5870.1606}}</ref> The final, successful campaign was led by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the [[United Nations]]. On 14 October 2010, with no diagnoses for nine years, the FAO announced that the disease had been completely eradicated,<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|title=UN 'confident' disease has been wiped out|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11542653|work=BBC|date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref> making this the first (and so far the only) disease of livestock to have been eradicated by human undertakings.

A dramatic reduction of the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[poliomyelitis]] in industrialized countries followed the development of a vaccine in the 1950s. In 1960, [[Czechoslovakia]] became the first country certified to have eliminated polio.

In 1988, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), [[Rotary International]], the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), and the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) passed the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Its goal was to eradicate polio by the year 2000. The updated strategic plan for 2004–2008 expects to achieve global eradication by interrupting poliovirus transmission, using the strategies of routine [[immunization]], supplementary immunization campaigns, and surveillance of possible outbreaks. The WHO estimates that global savings from eradication, due to forgone treatment and disability costs, could exceed one billion [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] per year.<ref>{{cite book | author = World Health Organization | title = Global polio eradication initiative : strategic plan 2004-2008 | publisher = WHO | year = 2003 | location = Geneva | url = http://www.polioeradication.org/content/publications/2004stratplan.pdf | isbn = 92-4-159117-X |accessdate= 2007-11-30 }}</ref>

The following world regions have been declared polio-free:
*The [[Americas]] (1994)
*[[Indo-West Pacific]] region (1997)
*[[Europe]] (1998)
*[[World_Health_Organization#Regional_offices|Western Pacific]] region, including [[China]] (2000)

The lowest annual polio prevalence seen so far was in 2012, with 223 reported cases. However, during the previous decade, following interruption of vaccination in Nigeria in 2003–4 and a reduction in immunisation in India in 2001–2, there was a resurgence of polio transmission: in 2001 there were 483 reported cases, but in the period of 2002 to 2010, the number of global reported cases remained between 750 and 2000 per year, with 1,349 cases in 2010.  Some of these cases were the result of new importations in 31 countries which had previously interrupted transmission, leading to many subsequent outbreaks. Three further countries remain in which poliovirus transmission has never been interrupted ([[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Afghanistan]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Progress towards interruption of wild poliovirus transmission—Worldwide, January 2007 to April 2008 |journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep]] |volume=57 |issue=18 |pages=489–494 |year=2008 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5718a4.htm |pmid=18472451 |accessdate= 2009-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Cochi and Kew |title=Polio today: are we on the verge of polio eradication? |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] |volume=300 |issue=7 |pages=839–41 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/300/7/839 |pmid=18714066|accessdate= 2009-01-16 |doi=10.1001/jama.300.7.839 |year=2008 |last2=Kew |first2=O}}</ref> [[India]] was removed from the WHO list of polio-endemic countries in 2012<ref>{{cite news |title=WHO takes India off polio list |author=Kounteya Sinha |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-26/india/31101391_1_polio-cases-crippling-disease-zero-cases |newspaper=The Times of India |date=26 February 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref> after no new cases were reported for one year.<ref>{{cite press release |title=India records one year without polio cases |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2012/polio_20120113/en/index.html |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date=12 January 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}</ref> The 223 cases in 2012 were from 5 countries (122 in Nigeria; 58 in Pakistan; 37 in Afghanistan; 5 in Chad and 1 in Niger), compared to 650 cases from 16 countries for 2011.<ref>http://www.polioeradication.org/Portals/0/Document/Data&Monitoring/Wild_poliovirus_list_2007_2012_20Nov.pdf</ref>

[[Dracunculiasis]], also called guinea worm disease, is a painful and disabling parasitic disease caused by a worm, ''[[Dracunculus medinensis]]''. It is spread through consumption of drinking water infested with [[copepod]]s hosting ''Dracunculus'' larvae. The [[Carter Center]] has led the effort to eradicate the disease, along with the CDC, the WHO, UNICEF, and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].

Unlike diseases such as smallpox and polio, there is no vaccine nor [[drug]] therapy for guinea worm. Eradication efforts have been based on making [[drinking water]] supplies safer (e.g. by provision of borehole wells, or through treating the water with larvicide), on containment of infection and on education for safe drinking water practices. These strategies have produced many successes: two decades of eradication efforts have reduced guinea worm's global [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] to 542 cases in 2012, down from an estimated 3.5 million in 1986.  Success has been slower than was hoped—the original goal for eradication was 1995. The WHO has certified 180 countries free of the disease, and only four countries—[[South Sudan]], [[Mali]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Chad]] — reported cases of guinea worm in 2012.  96% of all cases reported in 2012 were in South Sudan.<ref name=WHO_WER_86_10/><ref name=Wrap-up_209/><ref name="NEJM-drac">{{cite journal |journal= The New England Journal of Medicine |month= June 21 |year= 2007 |title= The Tail End of Guinea Worm — Global Eradication without a Drug or a Vaccine |url= http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/356/25/2561 |volume=356 |issue= 25 |pages= 2561–64 |last= Berry |first= Michele|doi= 10.1056/NEJMp078089 |pmid= 17582064 }}</ref>  As of 2010, the WHO predicted it would be "a few years yet" before eradication is achieved, on the basis that it took 6–12 years for the countries that have so far eliminated guinea worm transmission to do so after reporting a similar number of cases to that reported by Sudan in 2009.<ref name="WHO_WER_85-19">{{Cite document |author=World Health Organisation | title=Weekly Epidemiology Record 85, no 19, p. 166: Dracunculiasis eradication — global surveillance summary, 2009 |url=http://www.who.int/entity/wer/2010/wer8519.pdf |accessdate=2010-05-14 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

==Regional elimination established or under way==

Some diseases have already been eliminated from large regions of the world, and/or are currently being targeted for regional elimination.  This is sometimes described as "eradication", although technically the term only applies when this is achieved on a global scale.<ref>{{Cite web | title=International task force for disease eradication program definitions |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/itfde/program_definition.html | accessdate=2010-07-11 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>  Even after regional elimination is successful, interventions often need to continue to prevent a disease becoming re-established.  Three of the diseases here listed (lymphatic filariasis, measles, and rubella) are among the diseases believed to be potentially eradicable by the International Task Force for Disease Eradication, and if successful, regional elimination programs may yet prove a stepping stone to later global eradication programs.

This section does not cover elimination where it is used to mean control programs sufficiently tight to reduce the burden of an infectious disease or other health problem to a level where they may be deemed to have little impact on [[public health]], such as the [[leprosy]], neonatal [[tetanus]], or [[obstetric fistula]] campaigns.

===Hookworm===
In [[North American]] countries, such as the [[United States]], elimination of [[hookworm]] had been attained due to scientific advances. The [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s [[hookworm]] campaign in the 1920s was supposed to focus on the eradication of [[hookworm]] infections for those living in [[Mexico]] and other rural areas. However, the campaign was politically influenced, causing it to be less successful, and regions such as [[Mexico]] still deal with these infections from [[parasitic worms]]. This use of health campaigns by political leaders for political and economic advantages has been termed the science-politics paradox.<ref>Birn, Anne-Emanuelle, and Armando Solórzano. 1999. Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s. Social Science & Medicine 49 (9):1197-1213</ref>

===Malaria===
[[Malaria]] elimination has already been achieved in most of [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australasia]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Caribbean]], and parts of [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Southern Africa]], according to the Malaria Elimination Group at UCSF.<ref>{{cite web | title=Malaria Elimination Group description and list of elimination countries | accessdate=2011-07-12 | url=http://www.malariaeliminationgroup.org/resources/elimination-countries }}</ref> The WHO defines elimination as having no domestic transmission for the past three years.  They also define an "elimination stage" when a country is on the verge of eliminating malaria, as being <1 case per 1000 people at risk per year.  According to the 2011 WHO World Malaria Report, 28 countries are certified as having eliminated malaria.  Eight countries appear to be malaria free but steps still need to be taken to ensure they do not re-establish transmission. Nine countries are in the elimination stage and eight the pre-elimination stage (<5 cases per 1000 people at risk per year).<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO World Malaria Report 2011|url=http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2011/9789241564403_eng.pdf}}</ref> The WHO also reports in 2010 malaria killed approximately 655,000 people.  That is down about 36,000 from 2009.   

There has also been a discussion of moving to global eradication.  At the [[Gates Foundation]] Malaria Forum in October 2007, [[Bill Gates|Bill]] and [[Melinda Gates]] called for a new plan for malaria eradication, by going as far as possible with existing tools while also investing in new ones.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roberts and Enserink |date=7 December 2007 |journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] |title= MALARIA: Did They Really Say ...

===Lymphatic filariasis===

[[Lymphatic filariasis]] is an infection of the lymph system by mosquito-borne microfilarial worms which can cause [[elephantiasis]].  Studies have demonstrated that transmission of the infection can be broken when a single dose of combined oral medicines is consistently maintained annually for approximately seven years.<ref name="LFTreat">{{Cite web | author= The Carter Center| title=How is Lymphatic Filariasis Treated?|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/lf/treatment.html|accessdate=2008-07-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080414064850/http://www.cartercenter.org/health/lf/treatment.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-14}}</ref> The strategy for eliminating transmission of lymphatic filariasis is mass distribution of medicines that kill the microfilariae and stop transmission of the parasite by mosquitoes in endemic communities.<ref name="LFTreat"/> In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], albendazole is being used with ivermectin to treat the disease, whereas elsewhere in the world albendazole is used with [[diethylcarbamazine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/lf/index.html |title=Lymphatic Filariasis Disease — Carter Center Lymphatic Filariasis Program |publisher=Cartercenter.org |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> Using a combination of treatments better reduces the number of microfilariae in blood.<ref name="LFTreat"/> Avoiding mosquito bites, such as by using [[insecticide]]-treated mosquito [[bed nets]], also reduces the transmission of lymphatic filariasis.<ref name="LFTreat"/><ref name="CDC2">{{Cite web | author= U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention| title=Lymphatic filariasis prevention|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/lymphaticfilariasis/prevention_lymphatic_filar.htm|accessdate=2010-07-08 | postscript= <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

An elimination effort to address this is currently under way alongside the malaria effort described above; the Dominican Republic expects to eliminate its seven remaining foci by 2010, but lymphatic filariasis is still endemic to 110 of 140 communes in Haiti.<ref name="WER 84 (11 & 12)">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8411_12.pdf|title=WHO Weekly Epidemiology Record 84 (11 & 12),  2009|publisher=who.int|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>

As of October 2008, the efforts of the Global Programme to Eliminate LF are estimated to have already prevented 6.6 million new filariasis cases from developing in children, and to have stopped the progression of the disease in another 9.5 million people who have already contracted it.

In 2005, a global target was agreed for a 90% reduction in measles deaths by 2010 from the 757,000 deaths in 2000; estimates for 2008 show a 78% decline so far to 164,000 deaths.<ref>WHO Weekly Epidemiology Record 84 (49), 4th December 2009 http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8449/en/index.html</ref> However, some have been pushing to attempt global eradication.<ref>{{cite journal | author = de Quadros | year =2004 | title=Can measles be eradicated globally? | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | issue = 82(2) | url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0042-96862004000200011&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en | accessdate = 2009-11-15 | doi = 10.1590/S0042-96862004000200011}}</ref> This was updated at the 2010 world health assembly to a targeted 95% reduction in mortality by 2015, alongside specific vaccination and structural targets,<ref name=WHA63_11_15/><ref name=WHO63_daily_notes_4/> and in a meeting in November 2010, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization "concluded that measles can and should be eradicated".<ref name="WER 86-1">{{cite web | title=WHO Weekly Epidemiology Record 86, issues 1-2: Meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, November 2010 – summary, conclusions and recommendations | url=http://www.who.int/wer/2011/wer8601_02/en/index.html}}</ref>   A study of the costs of eradicating measles compared to the costs of maintaining indefinite control was commissioned in 2009 by the WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.<ref>WHO Weekly Epidemiology Record 84(44), Meeting of the International Task Force for Disease Eradication, June 2009, pages 459-465 http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8444.pdf</ref>

===Rubella===

Two WHO regions have set 2010 as a target for [[rubella]] elimination.  The WHO region of the Americas set itself a target for regional elimination of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome by 2010.  As of 2010, the last confirmed endemic case of rubella in the Americas was in Argentina in February 2009<ref name="RubellaWatch1">{{cite web | url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=782&Itemid=2180&lang=en | accessdate=2010-07-11|title=January–February 2010 Rubella Watch}}</ref> and verification of regional elimination is currently under way and due to complete by 2012.<ref name="RubellaWatch2">{{Cite web | url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=782&Itemid=2180&lang=en | accessdate=2010-07-11 |title = March–April 2010 Rubella Watch}}</ref> The WHO European region also set a target of 2010.<ref name="WHOEurope">{{Cite web | url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/79028/E87772.pdf | title=Eliminating measles and rubella and preventing congenital rubella infection WHO European Region Strategic Plan 2005-2010 | accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref> However, as of 2008 there were still 20,579 reported cases of rubella, 311 of which were laboratory confirmed, just among the 27 countries reporting data to EUVAC.<ref name="EUVAC-Rubella">{{Cite web |title=EUVAC.net rubella surveillance report 2008 | url=http://www.euvac.net/graphics/euvac/pdf/rubella_report_2008.pdf | accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref>

===Onchocerciasis===

[[Onchocerciasis]] (river blindness) is the world's second leading cause of infectious [[blindness]].  It is caused by the [[nematode]] ''Onchocerca volvulus'', which is transmitted to people via the bite of a [[black fly]].  Elimination of this disease is under way in the region of the Americas, where this disease is endemic to [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]] and [[Venezuela]].  The principal tool being used is mass [[ivermectin]] treatment. If successful, the only remaining endemic locations would be in [[Africa]] and [[Yemen]].<ref name="WHO WER 83(29)">{{Cite journal | url=http://www.who.int/wer/2008/wer8329.pdf | title=WHO Weekly Epidemiology Record | issue=83(29) | year=2008 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Since adopting such treatment measures in 1997, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control reports a reduction in the prevalence of onchocerciasis in the countries under its mandate from a pre-intervention level of 46.5% in 1995 to 28.5% in 2008.<ref name="WHO WER 85(04)">{{Cite journal | url=http://www.who.int/wer/2010/wer8504/en/index.html | title=WHO Weekly Epidemiology Record | issue=85(04) | year=2010 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Yaws===

[[Yaws]] is a rarely fatal but highly disfiguring disease caused by the spiral-shaped bacterium ([[spirochete]]) ''Treponema pertenue'', a relative of the [[syphilis]] bacteria ''Treponema pallidum'', spread through skin to skin contact with infectious lesions.  The global prevalence of this disease and the other endemic trematoses, [[Bejel]] and [[Pinta (disease)|Pinta]], was reduced by the Global Control of Treponematoses (TCP) programme between 1952 and 1964 from about 50 million cases to about 2.5 million (a 95% reduction).  However, following the cessation of this program these diseases remained at a low prevalence in parts of Asia, Africa and the Americas with sporadic outbreaks.  Yaws is currently targeted by the South-East Asian Regional Office of the WHO for elimination from the remaining endemic countries in this region ([[India]], [[Indonesia]] and [[East Timor]]) by 2010, and so far, this appears to have met with some success, since no cases have been seen in India since 2004.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Asiedu et al. |title=Yaws eradication: past efforts and future perspectives |journal=[[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]] |volume=86 |issue=7 |pages=499–500 |year=2008 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/7/08-055608/en/index.html |pmid=18670655 |accessdate= 2009-04-02 |doi=10.2471/BLT.08.055608 |last2=Amouzou |first2=B |last3=Dhariwal |first3=A |last4=Karam |first4=M |last5=Lobo |first5=D |last6=Patnaik |first6=S |last7=Meheus |first7=A |pmc=2647478}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Yaws_yaws.pdf | title = WHO South-East Asia report of an intercountry workshop on Yaws eradication | year=2006}}</ref>

===Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and new variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD)===

Following an epidemic of [[vCJD]] in the UK in the 1990s, there have been campaigns to eliminate [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] in cattle across the EU and beyond which appear to have achieved large reductions in the number of cattle with this disease.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/bse/bse20_en.html | title = Frequently asked questions about BSE | accessdate=2011-03-16 }}</ref> Cases of vCJD have also fallen since then, for instance from an annual peak in the UK of 28 cases in 2000 to 5 cases in 2011 and zero in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the UK|url=http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/documents/figs.pdf|publisher=The National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit, University of Edinburgh|date=2013-03-04|accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref>

Following the ongoing eradication effort, only 22 cases of BSE were reported worldwide in 2011, the fewest since at least 1988.<ref>http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/bse-specific-data/number-of-reported-cases-worldwide-excluding-the-united-kingdom/</ref><ref>http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/bse-specific-data/number-of-cases-in-the-united-kingdom/</ref>

==In fiction==

Futures and futuristic alien civilizations in which some or all infectious diseases have been eradicated are a staple of science fiction.  Examples include:

''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]], in which the Martians have long eradicated their own infectious diseases, leaving them vulnerable to Earth pathogens following the atrophy of their natural defences.

''[[The Evitable Conflict]]'', by [[Isaac Asimov]], describes a future run by Machines in the manner which they see as most conducive to man's best interests, in which "we have eradicated the [[anopheles mosquito]] and the [[tsetse fly]]".
