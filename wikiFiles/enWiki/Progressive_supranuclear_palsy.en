'''Progressive supranuclear palsy''' ('''PSP''') (or the '''Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome''', after the Canadian physicians who described it in 1963) is a [[degenerative disease]] involving the gradual deterioration and death of specific volumes of the [[brain]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richardson JC, Steele J, Olszewski J |title=Supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, pseudobulbar palsy, nuchal dystonia and dementia. A clinical report on eight cases of 'heterogeneous system degeneration' |journal=Transactions of the American Neurological Association |volume=88 |issue= |pages=25–9 |year=1963 |pmid=14272249}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Steele JC, Richardson JC, Olszewski J |title=Progressive supranuclear palsy: a heterogeneous degeneration involving brain stem, basal ganglia and cerebellum with vertical gaze and pseudobulbar palsy, nuchal dystonia and dementia |journal=Archives of Neurology |volume=10 |issue= |pages=333–59 |year=1964 |month=April |pmid=14107684 |url=http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14107684}}</ref>

[[Male]]s and [[female]]s are affected approximately equally and there is no racial, geographical or occupational predilection. Approximately 6 people per 100,000 population have PSP.

It has been described as a [[tauopathy]].<ref name="pmid18819991">{{cite journal |author=Rizzo G |title=Diffusion-weighted brain imaging study of patients with clinical diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 10 |pages=2690–700 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18819991 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn195 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18819991 |author-separator=, |author2=Martinelli P |author3=Manners D |display-authors=3 |last4=Scaglione |first4=C. |last5=Tonon |first5=C. |last6=Cortelli |first6=P. |last7=Malucelli |first7=E. |last8=Capellari |first8=S. |last9=Testa |first9=C.}}</ref>

==Symptoms and signs==
[[Image:Steele-olszewski-richardson_disease.jpg|thumb|This patient presented with progressive dementia, ataxia and incontinence. A clinical diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus was entertained. Imaging did not support this, however, and on formal testing abnormal nystagmus and eye movements were detected. A sagittal T1-weighted image shows atrophy of the midbrain, with preservation of the volume of the pons. This appearance has been called the "penguin sign". There is also atrophy of the tectum, particularly the superior colliculi. These findings suggest the diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy.]]
The initial symptoms in two-thirds of cases are loss of balance, lunging forward when mobilizing, fast walking, bumping into objects or people, and falls.  

Other common early symptoms are changes in personality, general slowing of movement, and visual symptoms.

Later symptoms and signs are [[dementia]] (typically including loss of inhibition and ability to organize information), [[Relaxed pronunciation|slurring of speech]], [[difficulty swallowing]], and difficulty [[Eye movement (sensory)|moving the eyes]], particularly in the vertical direction.  The latter accounts for some of the falls experienced by these patients as they are unable to look up or down.  

Some of the other signs are poor [[eyelid]] function, [[contracture]] of the [[facial muscles]], a backward tilt of the head with stiffening of the [[Table of muscles of the human body: Neck|neck muscles]], [[Sleep disorder|sleep disruption]], [[urinary incontinence]] and [[constipation]].

The visual symptoms are of particular importance in the diagnosis of this disorder.  Notably, the [[ophthalmoparesis]] experienced by these patients mainly concerns voluntary eye movement.  Patients tend to have difficulty looking down (a downgaze [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]]) followed by the addition of an upgaze palsy. Involuntary eye movement, as elicited by [[Bell's phenomenon]], for instance, may be closer to normal. On close inspection, eye movements called "square-wave jerks" may be visible when the patient fixes at distance.  These are fine movements, that can be mistaken for [[nystagmus]], except that they are saccadic in nature, with no smooth phase.  Difficulties with [[Convergence (eye)|convergence]] (convergence insufficiency), where the eyes come closer together while focusing on something near, like the pages of a book, is typical.  Because the eyes have trouble coming together to focus at short distances, the patient may complain of [[diplopia]] (double vision) when reading. 

Cardinal manifestations:
* Supranuclear ophthalmoplegia
* Neck dystonia
* [[Parkinsonism]]
* [[Pseudobulbar palsy]]
* Behavioral and Cognitive impairment
* Imbalance and Difficulties walking
* Frequent falls

==Prognosis==
There is currently no effective treatment or [[cure]] for PSP, although some of the [[symptom]]s can respond to nonspecific measures. The average age at symptoms onset is 63 and survival from onset averages 7 years with a wide variance.

==Differential diagnosis==
PSP is frequently misdiagnosed as [[Parkinson's disease]] because of the slowed movements and gait difficulty, or as [[Alzheimer's disease]] because of the behavioral changes. It is one of a number of diseases collectively referred to as [[Parkinson plus syndrome]]s. A poor response to levodopa along with symmetrial onset can help differentiate this disease from PD.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Which clinical features differentiate progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome) from related disorders? A clinicopathological study|journal=Brain.|year=1997|month=Jan|volume=120|pages=65–74|pmid=9055798|author=Litvan I, Campbell G, Mangone CA, Verny M, McKee A, Chaudhuri KR, Jellinger K, Pearce RK, D'Olhaberriague L.|issue=1}}</ref>

==Genetics and causal factors==
Fewer than 1% of those with PSP have a family member with the same disorder.  A variant in the [[Tau protein#Genetics|gene for tau protein]] called the H1 [[haplotype]], located on [[Chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]], has been linked to PSP.<ref>{{OMIM|601104}}</ref> Nearly all people with PSP received a copy of that variant from each parent, but this is true of about two-thirds of the general population.  Therefore, the H1 haplotype appears to be necessary but not sufficient to cause PSP.  Other genes, as well as [[Pollution|environmental toxins]] are being investigated as other possible contributors to the cause of PSP.

==Pathophysiology==
The affected brain cells are both [[neurons]] and [[glial cells]]. The neurons display [[neurofibrillary tangles]], which are clumps of [[tau protein]], a normal part of a brain cell's internal structural skeleton. These tangles are often different from those seen in Alzheimer's disease, but may be structurally similar when they occur in the cerebral cortex.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Amano N, Iwabuchi K, Yokoi S |title=[The reappraisal study of the ultrastructure of Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles in three cases of progressive supranuclear palsy] |language=Japanese |journal=Nō to Shinkei |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=35–44 |year=1989 |month=January |pmid=2655673}}</ref> Their chemical composition is usually different, however, and is similar to that of tangles seen in [[corticobasal degeneration]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1750-3639.1999.tb00550.x|journal=Brain Pathology|author1=Luc Buée |author2=André Delacourte|volume=9|pages=681–93|year=1999|url=[http://pagesperso-orange.fr/alzheimer.lille/pdf/1999/1999BueeBrainPathol.pdf Comparative Biochemistry of Tau in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Corticobasal Degeneration, FTDP-17 and Pick’s Disease]|pmid=10517507|title=Comparative biochemistry of tau in progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, FTDP-17 and Pick's disease|issue=4}}</ref> [[Lewy bodies]] are seen in some cases, but it is not clear whether this is a variant or an independent co-existing process.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Uchikado H, DelleDonne A, Ahmed Z, Dickson DW |title=Lewy bodies in progressive supranuclear palsy represent an independent disease process |journal=Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=387–95 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16691119 |doi=10.1097/01.jnen.0000218449.17073.43}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Keith-Rokosh J, Ang LC |title=Progressive supranuclear palsy: a review of co-existing neurodegeneration |journal=The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=602–8 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=19235444 |url=http://cjns.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=0317-1671&volume=35&issue=5&spage=602}}</ref>

The principal areas of the brain affected are:
* the [[basal ganglia]], particularly the [[subthalamic nucleus]], [[substantia nigra]] and [[globus pallidus]];
* the [[brainstem]], particularly the portion of the midbrain where "supranuclear" eye movement resides;
* the [[cerebral cortex]], particularly that of the [[frontal lobe]]s;
* the [[dentate nucleus]] of the [[cerebellum]];
* and the [[spinal cord]], particularly the area where some control of the bladder and bowel resides.

Some consider PSP, [[corticobasal degeneration]], and [[frontotemporal dementia]] to be variations of the same disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kertesz A, Munoz D |title=Relationship between frontotemporal dementia and corticobasal degeneration/progressive supranuclear palsy |journal=Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=282–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15178937 |doi=10.1159/000077155}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Acta Neuropathologica|year=2003|month=September|volume=106|issue=3|pages=251–60|url=[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12802605 4-repeat tauopathy sharing pathological and biochemical features of corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy]|pmid=12802605|author8=Andrew Lees|doi=10.1007/s00401-003-0728-8|last1=Katsuse|first1=O|last2=Iseki|first2=E|last3=Arai|first3=T|last4=Akiyama|first4=H|last5=Togo|first5=T|last6=Uchikado|first6=H|last7=Kato|first7=M|last9=Lees|first9=A|title=4-repeat tauopathy sharing pathological and biochemical features of corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy|authorlink8=Andrew Lees (neurologist)}}</ref> Others consider them separate diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hattori M, Hashizume Y, Yoshida M|title=Distribution of astrocytic plaques in the corticobasal degeneration brain and comparison with tuft-shaped astrocytes in the progressive supranuclear palsy brain |journal=Acta Neuropathologica |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=143–9 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12732936 |doi=10.1007/s00401-003-0711-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Acta Neuropathologica|year=1998|month=Oct|volume=96|issue=4|pages=401–8|url=[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9797005 Astrocytic plaques and tufts of abnormal fibers do not coexist in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy]|pmid=9797005|author8=Komori T, Arai N, Oda M, Nakayama H, Mori H, Yagishita S, Takahashi T, Amano N, Murayama S, Murakami S, Shibata N, Kobayashi M, Sasaki S, Iwata M.|doi=10.1007/s004010050911|last1=Komori|first1=T|last2=Arai|first2=N|last3=Oda|first3=M|last4=Nakayama|first4=H|last5=Mori|first5=H|last6=Yagishita|first6=S|last7=Takahashi|first7=T|last9=Murayama|first9=S|title=Astrocytic plaques and tufts of abnormal fibers do not coexist in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy}}</ref> PSP has been shown occasionally to co-exist with [[Pick's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16771179|year=2006|last1=Wang|first1=LN|last2=Zhu|first2=MW|last3=Feng|first3=YQ|last4=Wang|first4=JH|title=Pick's disease with Pick bodies combined with progressive supranuclear palsy without tuft-shaped astrocytes: a clinical, neuroradiologic and pathological study of an autopsied case|volume=26|issue=3|pages=222–30|journal=Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1789.2006.00671.x}}</ref>

==Classification and treatment==
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
PSP cases are often split into two subgroups, PSP-Richardson, the classic type, and PSP-Parkinsonism, where a short-term response to levodopa can be obtained.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/brain/awh488|last1=Williams|first1=DR|last2=De Silva|first2=R|last3=Paviour|first3=DC|last4=Pittman|first4=A|last5=Watt|first5=HC|last6=Kilford|first6=L|last7=Holton|first7=JL|author8=Williams DR, de Silva R, Paviour DC, Pittman A, Watt HC, Kilford L, Holton JL, Revesz T, Lees AJ.|last9=Lees|first9=AJ|title=Characteristics of two distinct clinical phenotypes in pathologically proven progressive supranuclear palsy: Richardson's syndrome and PSP-parkinsonism|journal=Brain|year=2005|month=Jun|volume=128|issue=6|pages=1247–58|pmid=15788542}}</ref>

Two studies have suggested that [[rivastigmine]] may help with cognitive aspects, but the authors of both studies have suggested a larger sampling be used.,<ref>{{cite journal|title=[Progressive supranucleair palsy: acetylcholineeserase-inhibitor a possible therapy?]|journal=Tijdschr Gerontol Geriatr.|year=2009|month=Jun|volume=40|issue=3|pages=133–7|pmid=19731749|author=Nijboer H, Dautzenberg PL.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Rivastigmine for the treatment of dementia in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy: Clinical observations as a basis for power calculations and safety analysis|journal=Alzheimers Dement.|year=2010|month=Jan|volume=6|issue=1|pages=70–4|pmid=20129321|author=Liepelt I, Gaenslen A, Godau J, Di Santo A, Schweitzer KJ, Gasser T, Berg D.|doi=10.1016/j.jalz.2009.04.1231}}</ref>

===Rehabilitation===
Patients with PSP usually seek or are referred to [[occupational therapy]] and physiotherapy for balance and [[gait]] problems with reports of frequent falls.<ref name="Zampieri">{{cite journal|last=Zampieri|first=Cris|coauthors=Di Fabio, Richard|title=Progressive Supranuclear Palsy: Disease Profile and Rehabilitation Strategies|journal=Physical Therapy|year=2006|month=June|volume=86|issue=6|pages=870–80|pmid=16737412}}</ref> Evidence-based approaches to rehabilitation in PSP are lacking, and currently the majority of research on the subject consists of case reports involving only a small number of patients. 

Case reports of rehabilitation programs for patients with PSP generally include limb-coordination activities, tilt-board balancing, [[gait training]], strength training with progressive resistive exercises and isokinetic exercises and stretching of the neck muscles.<ref name="Zampieri" /> While some case reports suggest that physiotherapy can offer improvements in balance and gait of patients with PSP, the results cannot be generalized across all patients with PSP as each case report only followed one or two patients.<ref name="Zampieri" /> The observations made from these case studies can be useful, however, in helping to guide future research concerning the effectiveness of balance and gait training programs in the management of PSP.

Individuals with PSP are often referred to occupational therapists to help manage their condition and to help enhance their independence. This may include being taught to use [[mobility aid]]s.<ref name="van Balken">{{cite journal|last=van Balken|first=Irene|coauthors=Litvan, Irene|title=Current and Future Treatments in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy|journal=Current Treatment Options in Neurology|year=2006|month=May|volume=8|issue=3|pages=211–23|doi=10.1007/s11940-006-0012-z|pmid=16569380}}</ref><ref name="Golbe">{{cite journal|last=Golbe|first=Lawrence|title=Progressive Supranuclear Palsy|journal=Current Treatment Options in Neurology|year=2001|month=November|volume=3|issue=6|pages=473–477|doi=10.1007/s11940-001-0010-0|pmid=11581524}}</ref>  Due to their tendency to fall backwards, the use of a walker, particularly one that can be weighted in the front, is recommended over a cane.<ref name="van Balken" />  The use of an appropriate mobility aid will help to decrease the individual’s risk of falls and make them safer to [[ambulate]] independently in the community.<ref name="Golbe" /> 
Due to their balance problems and irregular movements individuals will need to spend time learning how to safely transfer in their homes as well as in the community.<ref name="van Balken" /> This may include arising from and sitting in chairs safely.<ref name="Golbe" />

Due to the progressive nature of this disease, all individuals eventually lose their ability to walk and will need to progress to using a wheelchair.<ref name="van Balken" />
