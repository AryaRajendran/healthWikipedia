'''Bone grafting''' is a surgical procedure that replaces missing [[bone]] in order to repair [[bone fractures]] that are extremely complex, pose a significant health risk to the patient, or fail to heal properly. 

Bone generally has the ability to regenerate completely but requires a very small fracture space or some sort of scaffold to do so.  Bone grafts may be autologous (bone harvested from the patient’s own body, often from the [[iliac crest]]), allograft (cadaveric bone usually obtained from a bone bank), or synthetic (often made of [[hydroxyapatite]] or other naturally occurring and [[biocompatible]] substances) with similar mechanical properties to bone.  Most bone grafts are expected to be reabsorbed and replaced as the natural bone heals over a few months’ time. 

The principles involved in successful bone grafts include osteoconduction (guiding the reparative growth of the natural bone), osteoinduction (encouraging undifferentiated cells to become active osteoblasts), and osteogenesis (living bone cells in the graft material contribute to bone remodeling).  Osteogenesis only occurs with autografts.

Bone grafting is possible because bone tissue, unlike most other tissues, has the ability to regenerate completely if provided the space into which to grow.  As native bone grows, it will generally replace the graft material completely, resulting in a fully integrated region of new bone.  The biologic mechanisms that provide a rationale for bone grafting are osteoconduction, osteoinduction and osteogenesis.<ref name="AIS">{{cite book |author=Klokkevold, PR, Jovanovic, SA |chapter=Advanced Implant Surgery and Bone Grafting Techniques |editor=Newman, Takei, Carranza |title=Carranza's Clinical Periodontology |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |pages=907–8 |edition=9th }}</ref>

===Osteoconduction===
Osteoconduction occurs when the bone graft material serves as a [[scaffold]] for new bone growth that is perpetuated by the native bone.  [[Osteoblast]]s from the margin of the defect that is being grafted utilize the bone graft material as a framework upon which to spread and generate new bone.<ref name="AIS" />  In the very least, a bone graft material should be osteoconductive.

===Osteoinduction===
Osteoinduction involves the stimulation of osteoprogenitor cells to differentiate into osteoblasts that then begin new bone formation.  The most widely studied type of osteoinductive cell mediators are '''[[bone morphogenetic protein]]s''' (BMPs).<ref name="AIS" />  A bone graft material that is osteoconductive and osteoinductive will not only serve as a scaffold for currently existing osteoblasts but will also trigger the formation of new osteoblasts, theoretically promoting faster integration of the graft.

===Osteopromotion===
Osteopromotion involves the enhancement of osteoinduction without the possession of osteoinductive properties.  For example, [[enamel matrix derivative]] has been shown to enhance the osteoinductive effect of [[demineralized freeze dried bone allograft]] (DFDBA), but will not stimulate ''[[wikt:de novo|de novo]]'' bone growth alone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boyan BD, Weesner TC, Lohmann CH, ''et al.'' |title=Porcine fetal enamel matrix derivative enhances bone formation induced by demineralized freeze dried bone allograft ''in vivo'' |journal=J. Periodontol. |volume=71 |issue=8 |pages=1278–86 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10972643 |doi=10.1902/jop.2000.71.8.1278 |url=http://www.joponline.org/doi/abs/10.1902/jop.2000.71.8.1278%20?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref>

===Osteogenesis===
Osteogenesis occurs when vital osteoblasts originating from the bone graft material contribute to new bone growth along with bone growth generated via the other two mechanisms.<ref name="AIS" />

==Types and Tissue Sources==

===Autograft===
[[Autologous]] (or autogenous) bone grafting involves utilizing bone obtained from the same individual receiving the graft.  Bone can be harvested from non-essential bones, such as from the [[iliac crest]], or more commonly in oral and maxillofacial surgery, from the mandibular symphysis (chin area) or anterior mandibular ramus (the [[coronoid process of the mandible|coronoid process]]); this is particularly true for ''block grafts'', in which a small block of bone is placed whole in the area being grafted.  When a block graft will be performed, autogenous bone is the most preferred because there is less risk of the graft rejection because the graft originated from the patient's own body.<ref name=urlBone1>{{cite web |url=http://www.spineuniverse.com/displayarticle.php/article1766.html |title=Bone Grafts: No Longer Just a Chip Off the Ol' Hip |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  As indicated in the chart above, such a graft would be osteoinductive and osteogenic, as well as osteoconductive.  A negative aspect of autologous grafts is that an additional surgical site is required, in effect adding another potential location for post-operative pain and complications.<ref name="Bone Graft Alternatives">{{cite web |url=http://www.spine.org/Documents/bone_grafts_2006.pdf |format=PDF|title=Bone Graft Alternatives |work= |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>

Autologous bone is typically harvested from intra-oral sources as the chin or extra-oral sources as the [[iliac crest]], the [[fibula]], the [[ribs]], the [[Human mandible|mandible]] and even parts of the [[human skull|skull]].

All bone requires a blood supply in the transplanted site.  Depending on where the transplant site is and the size of the graft, an additional blood supply may be required.  For these types of grafts, extraction of the part of the [[periosteum]] and accompanying blood vessels along with donor bone is required.  This kind of graft is known as a [[vital bone graft]].

An autograft may also be performed without a solid bony structure, for example using bone reamed from the [[anterior superior iliac spine]]. In this case there is an osteoinductive and osteogenic action, however there is no osteoconductive action, as there is no solid bony structure.

===Allografts===
[[Allograft]] bone, like autogenous bone, is derived from humans; the difference is that allograft is harvested from an individual other than the one receiving the graft.  Allograft bone can be taken from [[cadaver]]s that have donated their bone so that it can be used for living people who are in need of it; it is typically sourced from a [[tissue bank|bone bank]]. Bone banks also supply allograft bone sourced from ''living'' human bone donors (usually hospital inpatients) who are undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty (total hip replacement surgery). During total hip replacement, the orthopaedic surgeon removes the patient's femoral head, as a necessary part of the process of inserting the artificial hip prosthesis. The femoral head is a roughly spherical area of bone, located at the proximal end of the femur, with a diameter of 45&nbsp;mm to 56&nbsp;mm in adult humans. The patient's femoral head is most frequently discarded to hospital waste at the end of the surgical procedure. However, if a patient satisfies a number of stringent regulatory, medical and social history criteria, and provides informed consent, their femoral head may be deposited in the hospital's bone bank.

There are three types of bone allograft available:<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/OralHealth/Infectioncontrol/faq/allografts.htm Bone Allografts]</ref>
# Fresh or fresh-frozen bone
# Freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA)
# Demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA)

===Synthetic variants===
[[File:Hydrogel-HA.jpg|thumb|120px|Flexible hydrogel-HA composite, which has a mineral-to-organic matrix ratio approximating that of human bone.]]
[[Artificial bone]] can be created from ceramics such as calcium phosphates (e.g. [[hydroxyapatite]] and [[tricalcium phosphate]]), [[Bioglass]] and [[calcium sulphate]]; all of which are biologically active to different degrees depending on solubility in the physiological environment.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hench, Larry L|title=Bioceramics: From Concept to Clinic|year= 1991|journal= Journal of the American Ceramic Society|url=http://www.ceramics.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/hench_bioceramics.pdf|volume=74|page=1487|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1991.tb07132.x}}</ref> These materials can be doped with [[growth factors]], ions such as [[strontium]] or mixed with [[bone marrow]] aspirate to increase biological activity. Some authors believe this  method is inferior to autogenous bone grafting<ref name=urlBone1/> however infection and rejection of the graft is much less of a risk, the mechanical properties such as [[Young's modulus]] are comparable to bone. The presence of elements such as [[strontium]] can result in higher [[bone mineral density]] and enhanced [[osteoblast]] proliferation [[in vivo]].

===Xenografts===
[[Xenograft]] bone substitute has its origin from a species other than human, such as [[cattle|bovine]]. Xenografts are usually only distributed as a calcified matrix. In January 2010 Italian scientists announced a breakthrough in the use of [[wood]] as a bone substitute, though this technique is not expected to be used for humans until at the earliest 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8438209.stm |title=Italian scientists' 'wood to bone' medical breakthrough |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-01-03 |accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>

===Alloplastic grafts===
Alloplastic grafts may be made from [[hydroxylapatite]], a naturally occurring mineral that is also the main mineral component of bone. They may be made from [[bioactive glass]].
Hydroxylapetite is a Synthetic Bone Graft, which is the most used now among other synthetic due to its osteoconduction, hardness and acceptability by bone. Some synthetic bone grafts are made of [[calcium carbonate]], which start to decrease in usage because it is completely resorbable in short time which make the bone easy to break again. Finally used is the tricalcium phosphate which now used in combination with hydroxylapatite thus give both effect osteoconduction and resorbability.

===Growth Factors===
[[Growth Factor]] enhanced grafts are produced using recombinant DNA technology.  They consist of either Human Growth Factors or Morphogens ([[Bone Morphogenic Proteins]] in conjunction with a carrier medium, such as collagen).

==Uses==

===Dental implants===
The most common use of bone grafting is in the application of [[dental implants]] to restore the [[edentulism|edentulous]] area of a missing tooth. Dental implants require bones underneath them for support and [[osseointegrate|proper integration]] into the mouth. People who have been edentulous (without teeth) for a prolonged period may not have enough bone left in the necessary locations.  In this case, bone can be taken from the chin, from the pilot holes for the implants, or even from the iliac crest of the pelvis and inserted into the mouth underneath the new implant.

In general, bone graft is either used en block (such as from the chin or the ascending ramus area of the lower jaw) or particulated, in order to be able to adapt it better to a defect.

Dental bone grafting is a specialized periodontal procedure that has been developed to reestablish lost jawbone.  This loss can be a result of [[tooth abscess|dental infection of abscess]], [[periodontal disease]], or trauma. There are various reasons for replacing lost bone tissue and encouraging natural bone growth, and each technique tackles jawbone defects differently. Reasons that bone grafting might be needed include [[sinus augmentation]], [[socket preservation]], ridge augmentation, or regeneration.<ref>Dr. Alina Krivitsky http://implantperiocenter.com/periodontal-services/bone-grafting</ref> 

===Fibular shaft===
Another common bone graft, which is more substantial than those used for dental implants, is of the fibular shaft. After the segment of the fibular shaft has been removed normal activities such as running and jumping are permitted on the leg with the bone deficit. The grafted, vascularized fibulas have been used to restore skeletal integrity to long bones of limbs in which congenital bone defects exist and to replace segments of bone after trauma or malignant tumor invasion. The periosteum and nutrient artery are generally removed with the piece of bone so that the graft will remain alive and grow when transplanted into the new host site. Once the transplanted bone is secured into its new location it generally restores blood supply to the bone in which it has been attached.

===Other===
Besides the main use of bone grafting – dental implants – this procedure is used to fuse joints to prevent movement, repair broken bones that have bone loss, and repair broken bone that has not yet healed.<ref name=urlBone2>{{cite news |url=http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/surgery/bone-graft/overview.html |title=Bone Graft - Surgery Procedures & Risks - NY Times Health Information |work= The New York Times|accessdate=}}</ref>

Bone grafts are used in hopes that the defective bone will be healed or will regrow with little to no [[graft rejection]].<ref name=urlBone2/>

==Procedure==
Depending on where the bone graft is needed, a different doctor may be requested to do the surgery.  Doctors that do bone graft procedures are commonly [[orthopedic surgeons]], [[otolaryngology|otolaryngology head and neck surgeons]], [[neurosurgeons]], [[craniofacial surgeon]]s, [[oral and maxillofacial surgeon]]s, [[Podiatric Surgeons]] and [[periodontists, dental surgeons, oral surgeons and implantologists]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/A-Ce/Bone-Grafting.html |title=Bone Grafting - Definition, Purpose, Demographics, Description, Diagnosis/preparation, Aftercare, Risks, Normal results, Morbidity and mortality rates, Alternatives |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Risks==
As with any procedure, there are risks involved; these include reactions to medicine, problems breathing, [[bleeding]], and [[infection]].<ref name=urlBone2/> Infection is reported to occur in less than 1% of cases and is curable with antibiotics.  Overall, patients with a preexisting illness are at a higher risk of getting an infection as opposed to those who are overall healthy.<ref name="John Gray Seiler">{{cite journal

==Recovery and Aftercare==
The amount of time it takes for an individual to recovery depends on the severity of the injury being treated and lasts anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months with a possibility of vigorous exercise being barred for up to 6 months.<ref name=urlBone2/>
