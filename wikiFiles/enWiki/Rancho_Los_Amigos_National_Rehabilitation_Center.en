==History==
[[File:Iron Lung ward-Rancho Los Amigos Hospital.gif|thumb|left|The hospital's polio ward, circa 1953]]

Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center, or '''Rancho''', dates back to 1888 when indigent patients from the [[Los Angeles County Hospital]] were relocated to what was then known as the Los Angeles County Poor Farm. [[Physical Therapy]] and [[Occupational Therapy]] were started in late 1920s.  The Rancho rapidly expanded after it was designated as a respiratory center for [[polio]] patients in 1951.  In 1955, Dr. Vernon L. Nickel developed the [[halo vest]], a device which is still in use to immobilize the cervical spine following severe neck injury or certain types of surgery. Drs. Jacquelin Perry and Robert Waters contributed to advances in [[gait analysis|pathokinesiology]] and treatment of spinal cord injuries, and other advances in rehabilitation of orthopedic and neurologic disorders were made in ensuing years. The [[Rancho Los Amigos Scale]], a widely used scale to determine the cognitive level in brain-injured patients, was developed in the 1970s.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.rancho.org/Rancho_History.aspx |title=Rancho's History |publisher=Rancho.org |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>
