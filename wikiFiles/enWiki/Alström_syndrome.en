'''Alström syndrome''' is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene [[ALMS1]]. It is among the rarest genetic disorders in the world, as currently it has only 266 reported cases in medical literature and over 501 known cases in 47 countries. It was first described by [[Carl-Henry Alström]] in Sweden in 1959. Alstrom syndrome is sometimes confused with [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]], which has similar symptoms. Bardet-Biedl syndrome tends to have later onset in its symptoms.

According to a 2007 article by Joy ''et al.'' publilshed in the [http://ojrd.com/ Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases]:

<blockquote>
"Alström syndrome (AS) is a rare [[autosomal]] recessive disease characterized by
multiorgan dysfunction. The key features are childhood obesity, blindness due to
congenital retinal [[:wikt:dystrophy|dystrophy]], and [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. Associated [[endocrinology|endocrinologic]]
features include [[hyperinsulinemia]], early-onset [[type 2 diabetes]], and [[hypertriglyceridemia]].
Thus, AS shares several features with the common metabolic syndrome, namely
obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Mutations in the [[ALMS1]] gene have
been found to be causative for AS with a total of 79 disease-causing mutations having
been described."<ref name="pmid18154657">{{cite journal | author=Joy T, Cao H, Black G, Malik R, Charlton-Menys V, Hegele RA, Durrington PN |title=Alstrom syndrome (OMIM 203800): a case report and literature review. | journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | year=2007 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pmid = 18154657 | url=http://www.ojrd.com/content/pdf/1750-1172-2-49.pdf | pmc=2266715 | doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-49 |pages=49}}</ref></blockquote>

==Diagnosis==
The [[Jackson Laboratory]] in [[Bar Harbor]], [[Maine]], USA with the [[University of Southampton]], UK isolated the single [[gene]] ([[ALMS1]]) responsible for Alström Syndrome. The gene is [[recessive]]; it must be passed from both parents for the syndrome to manifest.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

It is possible to clinically detect Alström syndrome in infancy, but more frequently, it is detected much later, as doctors tend to detect symptoms as separate problems. Currently, Alström syndrome is often diagnosed clinically, since [[genetic testing]] is costly and only available on a limited basis.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Diagnostic criteria==

Marshall JD et al. provided a comprehensive guidance for diagnostic criteria in their 2007 publication.

'''Birth – 2 years:'''

Minimum diagnosis requires 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria.

Major criteria are: 
1) ALMS1 mutation in 1 allele and/or family history of Alström Syndrome
2) Vision pathology (nystagmus, photophobia).

Minor criteria are:
1) Obesity
2) Dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure.

Other variable supportive evidence:
Recurrent pulmonary infections, normal digits, delayed developmental milestones.

'''At 3–14 years of age:'''

2 major criteria or 1 major and 3 minor criteria.

Major criteria are: 
1) ALMS1 mutation in 1 allele and/or family history of Alström Syndrome, 
2) Vision pathology (nystagmus, photophobia, diminished acuity). If old enough for testing: cone dystrophy by ERG.

Minor Criteria:
1) Obesity and/or insulin resistance and/or Type 2 Diabetes 
2) History of dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure
3) Hearing loss
4) Hepatic dysfunction
5) Renal failure
6) Advanced bone age

Variable supportive evidence:
Recurrent pulmonary infections, normal digits, delayed developmental milestones, hyperlipidemia, scoliosis, flat wide feet
hypothyroidism, hypertension, recurrent urinary tract infection, growth hormone deficiency.

'''Presentation 15 years – adulthood:'''

2 major and 2 minor criteria or 1 major and 4 minor criteria.

Major criteria are:
1) ALMS1 mutation in 1 allele and/or family history of Alström Syndrome.
2) Vision pathology (history of nystagmus in infancy/childhood, legal blindness, cone and rod dystrophy by ERG).

Minor criteria:
1) Obesity and/or insulin resistance and/or Type 2 Diabetes
2) History of dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure.
3) Hearing loss
4) Hepatic dysfunction
5) Renal failure
6) Short stature
7) Males: hypogonadism, Females: irregular menses and/or hyperandrogenism

Other supportive features:
Recurrent pulmonary infections, normal digits, history of developmental delay, hyperlipidemia, scoliosis, flat wide feet,
hypothyroidism, hypertension, recurrent urinary tract infections/urinary dysfunction, growth hormone deficiency, alopecia.

==Early symptoms==
*Heart failure (Dilated [[cardiomyopathy]]) in over 60% of cases, usually within the first few weeks after birth, but sometimes the onset is in adolescence or adulthood.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
*[[Light sensitivity]] and vision problems ([[Cone-rod dystrophy]]) in all cases, usually within 15 months of birth and progressively worsening until about 20 years of age{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
*Developmental delays in 50% of cases, [[learning disabilities]] in about 30% of cases{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
*[[Obesity]] in 100% of cases, apparent by 5 years of age, but often apparent in infancy (Alström infants usually have normal birth weights, and by adolescence, weights tend to be in the high-normal to normal range){{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}{{Or|date=December 2008}}

== Relation to other rare genetic disorders ==

Recent findings in genetic research have suggested that a large number of [[genetic disorder]]s, both [[Syndrome|genetic syndromes]] and [[Disease|genetic diseases]], that were not previously identified in the medical literature as related, may be, in fact, highly related in the [[genotype|genetypical]] root cause of the widely-varying, [[phenotype|phenotypically]]-observed [[Disorder (medicine)|disorders]].  Thus, Alstrom syndrome is a [[ciliopathy]].  Other known ciliopathies include [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]], [[polycystic kidney disease|polycystic kidney]] and [[polycystic liver disease|liver disease]], [[nephronophthisis]], [[Meckel-Gruber syndrome]] and some forms of [[retinal degeneration]].<ref>{{cite journal
