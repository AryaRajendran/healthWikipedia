'''1983 West Bank fainting epidemic'''  was a series of incidents in March 1983 in which 943 Palestinian teenage girls, mostly schoolgirls, and a small number of [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] women soldiers fainted or complained of feeling nauseous in the West Bank. Israel was accused of using "chemical warfare" to sterilize West Bank women while IDF sources speculated that a toxic substance had been employed by Palestinian militants to stir up unrest<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|title=MORE SCHOOLGIRLS IN WEST BANK FALL SICK|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/04/world/more-schoolgirls-in-west-bank-fall-sick.html|author = DAVID K.

This conclusion was supported by a Palestinian health official, who said that while 20% of the early cases may have been caused by the inhalation of some kind of gas, the remaining 80% were [[psychosomatic]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953801,00.html#ixzz1M8CldpGE Ailing schoolgirls ]</ref>

The [[New York Times]] later apologized for its misleading coverage of the event.<ref name=NYT/>

==The epidemic==
The first fainting spells were on March 21, 1983 in the [[West Bank]] town of [[Arraba, Jenin|Arraba]]h and the epidemic ended on April 3. Schoolgirls fell sick, some fainted. At the time the girls were in a different classrooms. They were taken to hospitals but no medical causes for their complaints were found. Some female Israeli soldiers who escorted the girls came down with the same symptoms, including [[nausea]], [[dizziness]], [[headache]] and stomach pains.<ref name=NYT/>

The US [[Centers for Disease Control]] wrote that 70% of patients were schoolgirls between the ages of 12 and 17, and that "clinical, epidemiologic, and toxicologic analyses indicated the illness was of psychogenic origin and was induced by stress. The outbreak, which began at a girls' secondary school, may have been triggered by the odor of low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H((2))S) gas near the school."
 
At the school in Arrabah where the epidemic began, 32 girls were affected. Over the next two weeks, girls complained of similar symptoms in [[Hebron]], [[Jenin]] and other towns. Palestinian schools were closed for 20 days.<ref>''Nod for three more Jewish villages'', Reuters in The New Straits Times (Malaysia), April 21, 1983</ref>  

The CDC said the epidemic occurred in two waves. The first began at 8:00 am on March 21, when a 17-year-old complained of throat irritation and shortness of breath shortly after entering her classroom. Over the next 2 hours, six students in the tenth and eleventh grades and an eleventh-grade teacher developed similar symptoms. Two students said they noticed a rotten egg-like odor. At 10:00 a.m., local public health authorities arrived in response to an emergency call. A search for toxic gas turned up nothing. Meanwhile, 17 other students complained of symptoms.

The second wave, on March 26–28, affected [[Jenin]] and nearby villages. 367 people complained of feeling ill, 246 of them schoolgirls. On April 3, schools closed and the epidemic subsided. "Data collected in these investigations indicate that the West Bank epidemic was triggered either by psychological factors, or, more probably, by the odor of low, sub-toxic concentrations of H((2))S gas escaping from a latrine at the secondary school in Arrabah. Subsequent propagation of the outbreak was mediated by psychological factors, occurred against a background of anxiety and stress, and may have been facilitated by newspaper and radio reports that described the symptoms in detail and suggested that a toxic gas was the cause.<ref>''Epidemic of Acute Illness - West Bank'', Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Centers for Disease Control, April 29, 1983</ref>

Albert Hefez, the lead psychiatric investigator of the epidemic for the Israeli Ministry of Health, said the reporting of the Israeli press and Palestinian distrust of Israel's intentions in the West Bank may have contributed to the incident. "The social and historical context of this incident may throw light on the subsequent snowballing of events," he wrote. He concluded that a headline in [[Ma'ariv]] newspaper on March 26, which described a "mysterious poisoning,"  implied the presence of an unknown perpetrator and fueled panic in the Arab community. He also said a front page article in [[Haaretz]] on March 28 may have fed local hysteria with its speculation that local activists may have been trying to stir up the population in anticipation of [[Land Day]]. 

The [[Arab League]] then accused Israel of using chemical weapons to exterminate Arabs, and Arab doctors at Tul Karem Hospital claimed  the gas was intended to produce sterility in the affected girls.<ref>''The Role of the Press and the Medical Community in the epidemic of "Mysterious Gas Poisoning" in the Jordan West Bank'', Albert Hefez, American Journal of Psychiatry, 142, pg. 833-837, July 1985.</ref>

==Aftermath==
Palestinian officials accused Israeli of using "chemical warfare" to drive them out of the West Bank and sterilize young women. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat alleged it was part of a "planned and systematic crime against our people." Some Israeli officials  accused the Palestinians of using poison to provoke mass demonstrations.<ref name=NYT/>

On 29 March 1983, the Deputy Permanent Observer of the Palestine Liberation Organization to the United Nations Hasan Abdul Rahman sent a letter to the UN Security Council in which he charged that the fainting spells were caused by Israeli poisoning. Rahman wrote that a "sulfurous powder" was found at two schools, and that a coke bottle containing a "noxious substance" and "emitting fumes" was found at a third school. He concluded "it is without question that a new phase in Israel's campaign of genocide against the Palestinian people has been launched."<ref name=UNISPAL1>{{cite web|title=S/15659 |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/CD105129FE6254058525701C0051E498|publisher=[[United Nations Information System on the Question of Palestine]]|date = 29 March 1983|accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref>

The Israeli military administration said a number of Palestinian "political agitators" were behind the outbreak.<ref>''Mystery Illness Due to Agitation'' Reuters in The Glasgow Herald, April 6, 1983</ref> Brig. Gen. Moshe Revah, head of the Israeli army's medical corps, reported that 10 Israeli soldiers in Jenin had fallen ill, while two wearing gas masks had not. "Border patrolman are not immune from such phenomena."<ref>''Israel maintains innocence in illness bout'', The Associated Press carried in The Lakeland Ledger, April 1, 1983</ref>

==Findings ==
The [[Israeli Ministry of Health]] said that the first cases could have been caused by an "environmental irritant." Yellow powder seen around a school in Jenin proved to be a common [[pollen]]. Though a trace of [[hydrogen sulfide]] was found, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], in [[Atlanta]] found that most of the fainting cases were psychological in nature.<ref name=NYT/> A Palestinian doctor from [[Hebron]] said "there is no sign of poisoning. Still, something has happened to these girls."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953801,00.html#ixzz1M8CldpGE Ailing schoolgirls]</ref>

On April 4, 1983, the UN Security Council requested  an independent investigation.<ref>[http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/d0911f77d9bb1f14852574050052b8d/7d3fc589363b44eb852570200050fccb?OpenDocument&Highlight=0,S%2F15680 Statement by the President of the UN Security Council (April 4, 1983) S/15680]</ref> The UN investigation found that mass hysteria was the likeliest cause of the epidemic, as did the [[Red Cross]].

On 25 August 1983 [[Yehuda Blum]], Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, wrote in a letter to the UN Secretary General that the accusations of poisoning by Israel were false and "Israel medical authorities, who immediately instituted an inquiry into the matter, could not establish the existence of any organic cause." A World Health Organization inquiry also found no organic causes for "this ill-defined health emergency." The letter also cites Red Cross doctor Franz Altherr, who felt it "was a mass phenomenon without any organic basis."<ref name=UNISPAL2>{{cite web|title=A/38/365 S/15939

In late April, a Team of US medical researchers from the Department of Health and Human Services  rejected contentions that "943 cases of acute illness over two weeks were caused by deliberate poisoning or were fabricated for propaganda purposes," and concluded that the outbreaks represented an epidemic of psychological illness triggered by anxiety.<ref>U.S. Experts Blame Anxiety For Illness of West Bank Girls, The New York Times, April 25, 1983</ref>

==New York Times apology==
In an Editors Note, the New York Times apologized for its early coverage of the epidemic. "First reports suggested that the illness was caused by mass poisoning. But Israeli and American doctors later concluded that the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea and headaches, had been caused by mass hysteria. Articles on April 4, April 5, and April 26 reported on these medical investigations. But because of the positions and relative lengths of the articles, the overall effect was greater emphasis on the charge of poisoning than on the Israeli rebuttal."

The New York Times also apologized for quoting an Arab doctor in the West Bank without giving equal time to Israeli officials.<ref name=NYT/>

==Criticism==
In a review of a book about the incident, ''Poison: A Modern manifestation of a blood libel'', by Israeli historian [[Raphael Israeli]], [[Manfred Gerstenfeld]] of the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] described the incident as one of "many similar Arab campaigns whose core element was a major lie."<ref name=JCPA>{{cite web|title=Poison: Modern Manifestations of a Blood Libel by Raphael Israeli |url=http://jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=3&DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=625&PID=0&IID=1794&TTL=Manfred_Gerstenfeld_on_Poison:_Modern_Manifestations_of_a_Blood_Libel
|author = [[Manfred Gerstenfeld]]|publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]|date = March 2005|accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref> Israeli journalist [[Dan Margalit]] wrote that the incident was tantamount to a modern blood libel against the Jews.<ref name=Poison>{{cite book|title=Poison: modern manifestations of a blood libel|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i8gdMNJmpvUC&pg=PA18&dq=poison+blood+libel+%22Dan+Margalit%22&hl=en&ei=qPfJTe3VIIzQsAPwu4idAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=poison%20blood%20libel%20%22Dan%20Margalit%22&f=false|page=18|author = [[Raphael Israeli]]|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|ISBN=0739102087|year = 2002|accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref> According to [[Richard Landes]], the incident was an "extensive, premeditated fraud" resulting in an international scandal. The accusations were presented as "probable" in the Western press, which stopped covering the event when evidence of staging came to light.<ref>[http://www.theaugeanstables.com/reflections-from-second-draft/pallywood-a-history/ Pallywood: A History]</ref>[[Khaled Abu Toameh]] wrote that the girls were trying to avoid exams. They claimed Israel poisoned the tanks that supplied drinking water to their school and began "fainting" in the  school yard when photographers and TV crews arrived. When medical tests found nothing amiss, the girls were released from the hospital. According to Abu Toameh, "the exams were postponed indefinitely and Israeli 'occupation' was once again blamed for perpetrating a 'new crime' against Palestinians." <ref>[http://www.hudson-ny.org/1488/hassan-nasrallah-mossad-agent Is Hassan Nasrallah a Mossad Agent?]</ref>
