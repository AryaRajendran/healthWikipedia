'''Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister''', [[Baronet|Bt.]], [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|OM]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] (5 April 1827{{spaced ndash}}10 February 1912), known as '''Sir Joseph Lister, [[Baronet|Bt.]]''', between 1883 and 1897, was a [[English people|British]] [[surgery|surgeon]] and a pioneer of [[Antiseptic#Usage in surgery|antiseptic surgery]]. By applying [[Louis Pasteur]]'s advances in [[microbiology]], he promoted the idea of [[sterile technique|sterile]] surgery while working at the [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]]. Lister successfully introduced [[carbolic acid]] (now known as [[phenol]]) to [[Sterilisation (microbiology)|sterilise]] surgical instruments and to clean [[wound]]s, which led to a reduction in post-operative infections and made surgery safer for patients.

==Early life and education==
Lister came from a prosperous [[Quaker]] home in [[West Ham|Upton]], [[Essex]], a son of [[Joseph Jackson Lister]], a pioneer of achromatic object lenses for the [[compound microscope]].

At [[Quaker]] schools, he became a fluent reader of French and German, which were also the leading languages of medical research.<ref Name="Nuland">''Doctors – The History of Medicine through Biography'' by [[Sherwin B. Nuland]]</ref> As a teenager, Lister attended [[Grove House School]] Tottenham, studying mathematics, natural science, and languages.

He attended [[University College London]],<ref>{{cite book |author=John Bankston |title=Joseph Lister and the Story of Antiseptics (Uncharted, Unexplored, and Unexplained) |publisher=Mitchell Lane Publishers |location=Bear, Del |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-58415-262-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> one of only a few institutions which accepted Quakers at that time. He initially studied botany and obtained a bachelor of Arts degree. He registered as a medical student and graduated with [[cum laude|honours]] as [[Bachelor of Medicine]], subsequently entering the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] at the age of 26. In 1854, Lister became both first assistant to and friend of surgeon [[James Syme]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]] in Scotland.

In 1867, Lister championed the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, such that it became the first widely used antiseptic in surgery. He first suspected it would prove an adequate disinfectant because it was used to ease the stench from fields irrigated with sewage waste.  He presumed it was safe because carbolic acid treated fields produced no apparent ill-effects on the livestock that later grazed upon them.  He subsequently left the Quakers, joined the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], and eventually married Syme's daughter, Agnes.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v14/i2/scientists.asp |quote=Lister married Syme's daughter Agnes and became a member of the Episcopal church|journal=Creation |volume=14|issue=2|pages=48–51|date=March 1992|author=Ann Lamont|title=Joseph Lister: father of modern surgery}}</ref> On their honeymoon, they spent 3 months visiting leading medical institutes (hospitals and universities) in France and Germany. By this time, Agnes was enamoured of medical research and was Lister's partner in the laboratory for the rest of her life.

==Career==

===Antiseptics===
[[File:Joseph Lister2.jpg|thumb|upright|Joseph Lister]]
Until Lister's studies of surgery most people believed that chemical damage from exposures to bad air (see "[[Miasma theory of disease|miasma]]") was responsible for [[infections]] in wounds. Hospital wards were occasionally aired out at midday as a precaution against the spread of infection via miasma, but facilities for washing hands or a patient's [[wound]]s were not available. A surgeon was not required to wash his  hands before seeing a patient because such practices were not considered necessary to avoid infection.  Despite the work of [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], hospitals practised surgery under unsanitary conditions.  Surgeons of the time referred to the "good old surgical stink" and took pride in the accumulated stains on their unwashed operating gowns as a display of their experience.<ref name="storyof medicine">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WKkCwqDEI9QC&pg=PA420&lpg=PA420&dq=%22good+old+surgical+stink%22&source=bl&ots=fdTL9PLgQ5&sig=uDsbTcCZX_Hk0i1b8Ob0hOEg2y4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kM9qUeefFeak4gT_0oGwDw&ved=0CFgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22good%20old%20surgical%20stink%22&f=false | title=The Story Of Medicine | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | author=Robinson, Victor | pages=420}}</ref>  Lister’s house surgeon, St. Clair Thompson, recounted that Lister himself used to operate in his street clothes, wearing the same blue frock coat that he wore in the dissecting room, stiff with old blood.<ref name="ejotr">{{cite journal | url=http://www.ejotr.org/Data/Sites/1/publishedarticles/issue15_1/19-12.pdf | title=Great Names in the History of Orthopaedics XIV: Joseph Lister (1827 e 1912) Part 2 | author=Louis, Fu Kuo-Tai | journal=Journal of Orthopaedics, Trauma and Rehabilitation | year=2011 | issue=15 | pages=33}}</ref> 

While he was a professor of surgery at the [[University of Glasgow]], Lister became aware of a paper published by the French [[chemist]] [[Louis Pasteur]], showing that rotting and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] could occur under [[Anaerobic infection|anaerobic conditions]] if [[micro-organisms]] were present.  Pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate the [[micro-organisms]] responsible for [[gangrene]]: filtration, exposure to heat, or exposure to [[solution|chemical solution]]s.  Lister confirmed Pasteur's conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop [[antiseptic]] techniques for wounds.  As the first two methods suggested by Pasteur were inappropriate for the treatment of human tissue, Lister experimented with the third.

Friedlieb Runge (1797–1867) discovered [[creosote]], which later was processed into [[carbolic acid]].<ref>Bynum, W. F. Science and the practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century, Cambridge:Cambridge, 1994.</ref>  Although Runge had no understanding of how decomposition occurred, the chemical had been used to treat the wood used for railway ties and ships since it protected the wood from rotting. Later, it was used for treating sewage in England, Belgium and Holland.  The same chemical was also used to fight parasites and reduce the odors during cholera and cattle plague.    

Therefore, Lister tested the results of spraying instruments, the surgical incisions, and dressings with a solution of it. Lister found that [[carbolic acid]] solution swabbed on wounds remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene.  In August 1865, Lister applied a piece of lint dipped in carbolic acid solution onto the wound of an eleven-year-old boy at Glasgow Infirmary, who had sustained a compound fracture after a cart wheel had passed over his leg. After four days, he renewed the pad and discovered that no infection had developed, and after a total of six weeks he was amazed to discover that the boy's bones had fused back together, without the danger of [[suppuration]]. He subsequently published his results in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in a series of 6 articles, running from March through July 1867, entitled: "''On a new method of treating compound fracture, abscess, etc.: with observation on the conditions  suppuration''".

Later, on 9 August 1867, he read a paper before the British Medical Association in Dublin,  on the ''[[Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery]]'',  which was reprinted in ''The British Medical Journal''.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2310614|volume=2|issue=351|pages=245–260|journal=The British Medical Journal|date=21 September 1867|title=On the Antiseptic Principle in the Practice of Surgery|pmid=20744875|author=Lister J}}.

He instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean [[gloves]] and wash their hands before and after operations with 5% carbolic acid [[Chemical solution|solution]]s. Instruments were also washed in the same solution and assistants sprayed the solution in the [[operating theatre]]. One of his additional suggestions was to stop using [[porous]] natural materials in manufacturing the handles of medical instruments. 

Lister left [[Glasgow]] in 1869, returning to [[Edinburgh]] as successor to Syme as Professor of Surgery at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and continued to develop improved methods of [[antisepsis]] and [[asepsis]]. His fame had spread by then, and audiences of 400 often came to hear him lecture. As the [[germ theory of disease]] became more widely accepted, it was realised that infection could be better avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led to the rise of sterile surgery. Some consider Lister "the father of modern antisepsis".

===Surgical technique===
Lister moved from Scotland to [[King's College Hospital]], in London. In 1881 he was elected President of the [[Clinical Society of London]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.archive.org/stream/transactionscli21londgoog/transactionscli21londgoog_djvu.txt|title = Transactions of the Clinical Society of London Volume 18 1886]]|publisher= Clinical Society|accessdate = 2012-10-23}} archive.org</ref> He also developed a method of repairing [[kneecap]]s with metal wire and improved the technique of [[mastectomy]]. His discoveries were greatly praised and in 1883 he was created a '''Baronet''', of Park Crescent in the Parish of St Marylebone in the County of Middlesex.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=25300 |date=28 December 1883 |startpage=6687 }}</ref> In 1897 he was further honoured when he was raised to the peerage as '''Baron Lister''', of [[Lyme Regis]] in the County of Dorset.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=26821 |date=9 February 1897 |startpage=758 }}</ref><ref>''[[The Times]]'',  Friday, Jan 01, 1897; Issue 35089; p. 8; col A</ref> He also became one of the twelve original members of the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]] and a Privy Councillor in the Coronation Honours in 1902.<ref>Coronation Honours. ''[[The Times]]'',  Thursday, Jun 27, 1902; Issue 36804; p. 5; col B</ref>

Among his students at [[King's College London]] was [[Robert Hamilton Russell]], who later moved to Australia.

==Later life==
Lister retired from practice after his wife, who had long helped him in [[research]], died in 1892 in Italy, during one of the few holidays they allowed themselves. Studying and writing lost appeal for him and he sank into [[religious]] [[melancholy]]. Despite suffering a [[stroke]], he still came into the public light from time to time. [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] came down with [[appendicitis]] two days before his [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]]. Like all internal surgery at the time, the appendectomy needed by the King still posed an extremely high risk of death by post-operational infection, and surgeons did not dare operate without consulting Britain's leading surgical authority. Lister obligingly advised them in the latest antiseptic surgical methods (which they followed to the letter), and the King survived, later telling Lister, "I know that if it had not been for you and your work, I wouldn't be sitting here today."

Lister died on 10 February 1912 at his country home in [[Walmer]], Kent at the age of 84. After a funeral service at [[Westminster Abbey]], he was buried at [[Hampstead Cemetery]], Fortune Green, London in a plot to the south-west of central chapel. Both the baronetcy and barony became extinct on his death.

==Legacy and honours==
[[Image:Listerbuilding.jpg|thumb|right|Lister Building at [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]]]]
Lister was president of the [[Royal Society]] between 1895 and 1900. Following his death, a Memorial Fund led to the founding of the [[Lister Medal]], seen as the most prestigious prize that could be awarded to a surgeon.

A British Institution of Preventive Medicine, previously named after [[Edward Jenner]] was renamed in 1899 in honour of Lister.

Two postage stamps were issued in September 1965 to honour Lister for his contributions to antiseptic surgery.

Lister is one of the two surgeons in the United Kingdom who have the honour of having a public monument in London. Lister's stands in [[Portland Place]]; the other surgeon is [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]. There is a statue of Lister in [[Kelvingrove Park]], [[Glasgow]], celebrating his links with the city.

A building at [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]] which houses cytopathology, microbiology and pathology departments was named in his honour to recognise his work at the hospital.

[[Lister Hospital (Stevenage)|Lister Hospital]] in [[Stevenage]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]] is named in honour of Lister.

The [[Discovery Expedition]] of 1901–04 named the highest point in the [[Royal Society Range]], Antarctica, Mount Lister.<ref name=gnis_ml>{{cite gnis|type=antarid|id=8895|name=Mount Lister|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref>

In 1879, [[Listerine]] [[mouthwash]] was named after him for his work in antisepsis. Microorganisms named in his honour include the pathogenic bacterial genus ''[[Listeria]]'' named by [[Harvey Pirie|J.H.H. Pirie]], typified by the food-borne pathogen ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', as well as the [[slime mould]] genus ''[[Listerella]]'', first described by Eduard Adolf Wilhelm Jahn in 1906.

He is depicted in the [[Academy Award]] winning 1936 [[film]], ''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]'', by [[Halliwell Hobbes]]. In the film, Lister is one of the beleaguered microbiologist's most noted supporters in the otherwise largely hostile medical community and is the key speaker in the ceremony in his honor.
