==History==
The UVA Health System’s history can be traced to the founding of the University of Virginia in 1819. At the first meeting of the university’s Board of Visitors in 1819, a School of Medicine was authorized. The [[School of Medicine]] – the 10th medical school in the U.S. – officially opened in March 1825 with a single professor, Dr. [[Robley Dunglison]], recruited by [[Thomas Jefferson]] to UVA from London.<ref name="dung">{{cite web |url=http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/administration/office-of-the-dean/about/factbook/chapter-1-history |title=History-School of Medicine at the University of Virginia |work=School of Medicine Official Website |accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref>

More than 75 years later, UVA opened its first hospital in March 1901 with 25 beds and three operating rooms. A few months after its opening, the hospital established a training program for nurses. That training program would grow into the UVA School of Nursing, which was formally established in 1956.

Just as medical education has been a part of UVA since its founding, so too has medical literature – the 8,000 books purchased by Jefferson to create the University Library included 710 books on the medical sciences. UVA’s medical literature moved to the UVA Medical School building in 1929. Its current home was dedicated in April 1976. The UVA Health Services Foundation was founded in 1979 to handle billing as well as provide benefits and administrative support to UVA physicians. The UVA Health Services Foundation was renamed University Physicians Group in 2011.

==Components==
The University of Virginia Health System consists of five components:

*The University of Virginia Medical Center provides primary, specialty and emergency care throughout Central Virginia through a network of clinics as well as a main hospital that has more than 500 beds, not including a 45-bed [[neonatal intensive care unit]] and 20-bed [[Nursery (room)|nursery]]. The Children's Hospital is served by the Newborn Emergency Transport System (NETS), which transports critically ill newborns and pediatrics from all over the surrounding area and states back to UVA. The hospital is a [[Trauma center#Level I|Level I trauma center]] and is accessible by [[ambulance]] as well as Pegasus, UVA Health System’s air and ground transport service for critically ill and injured patients. As an academic medical center, patients at UVA are treated by physicians who are also faculty members at the UVA School of Medicine. In the 2010 fiscal year, the UVA Medical Center treated 27,087 inpatients and had a total of 735,631 outpatient visits.<ref name="hs-facts">{{cite web |url=http://uvahealth.com/about/about-us/facts-at-a-glance |title=Facts at a Glance |work=UVA Health System Official Website |accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref>

*The [[University of Virginia School of Medicine]] has more than 1,000 faculty members who perform three main tasks: provide care to patients at the UVA Medical Center, educate medical students and residents and perform scientific medical research that may lead to improved care for patients at UVA and elsewhere. Leading research areas include cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases and vaccine development.<ref name="hs-topdoc">{{cite web |url=http://uvahealth.com/about/news-room/archives/americas-top-doctors-names-48-uva-physicians-as-best-in-their-fields/?searchterm=top%20doctors |title=America's Top Doctors Names 48 UVA Physicians as Best in their Fields |work=UVA Health System Official Website |accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref>

*The [[University of Virginia School of Nursing]] has 94 faculty members who educate student nurses and perform research that will improve patient care at UVA and elsewhere. Leading research areas include rural healthcare, the history of nursing, complementary and alternative therapies, geriatrics and oncology.

*The Claude Moore Health Sciences Library provides access to printed and online medical information, medical news and the history of healthcare to faculty, students and staff as well as the public.

*The University Physicians Group is the physician group practice that processes billing for UVA physician services.
