'''Glioblastoma multiforme''' ('''GBM'''), [[WHO classification of the tumors of the central nervous system|WHO classification name]] "glioblastoma", is the most common and most aggressive malignant primary [[brain tumor]] in humans, involving [[glial cell]]s and accounting for 52% of all functional tissue brain tumor cases and 20% of all intracranial tumors. GBM is rare, with incidence of 2–3 cases per 100,000 in Europe and North America. It presents two variants: [[giant cell glioblastoma]] and [[gliosarcoma]].

Treatment can involve [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation]] and [[surgery]]. Median survival with standard-of-care radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide is 15 months. Median survival without treatment is 4½ months. Surgery is controversial because no randomized controlled trials have been done.<ref name="Kolata">{{cite news |author=Gina Kolata and Lawrence K.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Main|Brain tumor}}

Although common symptoms of the disease include [[seizure]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[headache]], and [[hemiparesis]], the single most prevalent symptom is a progressive memory, personality, or neurological deficit due to [[temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[frontal lobe]] involvement. The kind of symptoms produced depends highly on the location of the tumor, more so than on its pathological properties. The tumor can start producing symptoms quickly, but occasionally is an [[asymptomatic condition]] until it reaches an enormous size.

==Causes==
For unknown reasons, GBM occurs more commonly in males.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ohgaki |first1=H |last2=Kleihues |first2=P |title=Population-based studies on incidence, survival rates, and genetic alterations in astrocytic and oligodendroglial gliomas |journal=Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=479–89 |year=2005 |pmid=15977639}}</ref>

* Sex: male (slightly more common in men than women)
* Age: over 50 years old
* Ethnicity: Caucasians, Asians
* Having a low-grade [[astrocytoma]] (brain tumor), which often, given enough time, develops into a higher-grade tumor
* Having one of the following genetic disorders is associated with an increased incidence of gliomas:
** [[Neurofibromatosis]]
** [[Tuberous sclerosis]]
** [[Von Hippel-Lindau disease]]
** [[Li-Fraumeni syndrome]]
** [[Turcot syndrome]]

==Pathogenesis==
Glioblastoma multiforme tumors are characterized by the presence of small areas of [[Necrosis|necrotizing]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] that is surrounded by [[anaplastic]] cells. This characteristic, as well as the presence of [[hyperplastic]] blood vessels, differentiates the tumor from Grade 3 [[astrocytomas]], which do not have these features. 

There are four subtypes of glioblastoma.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016.2Fj.ccr.2009.12.020}}</ref>
Ninety-seven percent of tumors in the ‘classical’ subtype carry extra copies of the [[Epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR) gene, and most have higher than normal expression of [[Epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR), whereas the gene [[TP53]], which is often mutated in glioblastoma, is rarely mutated in this subtype.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hayden |first1=Erika Check |title=Genomics boosts brain-cancer work |journal=Nature |volume=463 |issue=7279 |page=278 |year=2010 |pmid=20090720 |doi=10.1038/463278a}}</ref> In contrast, the proneural subtype often has high rates of alterations in TP53, and in PDGFRA, the gene encoding a-type [[platelet-derived growth factor receptor]], and in IDHl, the gene encoding [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]]-1. The mesenchymal subtype is characterized by high rates of mutations or other alterations in NF1, the gene encoding [[Neurofibromatosis type 1]] and fewer alterations in the EGFR gene and less expression of EGFR than other types.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kuehn |first1=B. M. |title=Genomics Illuminates a Deadly Brain Cancer |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=303 |issue=10 |pages=925–7 |year=2010 |pmid=20215599 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.236}}</ref>

GBMs usually form in the cerebral white matter, grow quickly, and can become very large before producing symptoms. Less than 10% form more slowly following degeneration of [[Fibrillary astrocytoma|low-grade astrocytoma]] or [[anaplastic astrocytoma]]. These are called secondary GBMs and are more common in younger patients (mean age 45 versus 62 years).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ohgaki |first1=Hiroko |last2=Kleihues |first2=Paul |title=Genetic alterations and signaling pathways in the evolution of gliomas |journal=Cancer Science |volume=100 |issue=12 |year=2009 |pmid=19737147 |doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01308.x |pages=2235–41}}</ref> The tumor may extend into the meninges or [[Ventricular system|ventricular]] wall, leading to high protein content in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) (> 100&nbsp;mg/dL), as well as an occasional [[pleocytosis]] of 10 to 100 cells, mostly [[lymphocyte]]s. [[Malignant]] cells carried in the CSF may spread (rarely) to the [[spinal cord]] or cause meningeal gliomatosis. However, [[metastasis]] of [[GBM]] beyond the [[central nervous system]] is extremely unusual. About 50% of GBMs occupy more than one lobe of a hemisphere or are bilateral. Tumors of this type usually arise from the [[cerebrum]] and may rarely exhibit the classic infiltration across the [[corpus callosum]], producing a butterfly (bilateral) [[glioma]]. 

The tumor may take on a variety of appearances, depending on the amount of hemorrhage, [[necrosis]], or its age. A CT scan will usually show an inhomogeneous mass with a hypodense center and a variable ring of enhancement surrounded by [[edema]]. Mass effect from the tumor and edema may compress the ventricles and cause [[hydrocephalus]].

Cancer cells with stem cell-like properties have been found in glioblastomas (this may be a cause of their resistance to conventional treatments, and high reoccurrence rate).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Murat |first1=A. |last2=Migliavacca |first2=E. |last3=Gorlia |first3=T. |last4=Lambiv |first4=W.

A biomarker for cells in glioblastomas that exhibit [[cancer stem cell]] properties, the transcription factor [[Hes3 signaling axis|Hes3]], has been shown to regulate their number when placed in culture.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Park DM, Jung J, Masjkur J, ''et al.'' |title=Hes3 regulates cell number in cultures from glioblastoma multiforme with stem cell characteristics |journal=Sci Rep |volume=3 |issue= |pages=1095 |year=2013 |pmid=23393614 |doi=10.1038/srep01095 |url=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

[[File:Glioblastoma (1).jpg|thumb|150px|Glioblastoma (histology slide)]]
When viewed with [[MRI]], glioblastomas often appear as ring-enhancing lesions.  The appearance is not specific, however, as other lesions such as [[abscess]], [[metastasis]], [[tumefactive multiple sclerosis]], and other entities may have a similar appearance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smirniotopoulos |first1=J.

Because the tumor grade is based upon the most malignant portion of the tumor, biopsy or subtotal tumor resection can result in undergrading of the lesion. Imaging of tumor blood flow using perfusion MRI and measuring tumor metabolite concentration with [[In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy|MR spectroscopy]] may add value to standard MRI in the diagnosis of glioblastoma, but pathology remains the gold standard.

==Treatment==
It is very difficult to treat glioblastoma due to several complicating factors:<ref name = "pmid12672279">{{cite journal |last1=Lawson |first1=H. Christopher |last2=Sampath |first2=Prakash |last3=Bohan |first3=Eileen |last4=Park |first4=Michael C. |last5=Hussain |first5=Namath |last6=Olivi |first6=Alessandro |last7=Weingart |first7=Jon |last8=Kleinberg |first8=Lawrence |last9=Brem |first9=Henry |title=Interstitial chemotherapy for malignant gliomas: the Johns Hopkins experience |journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=61–70 |year=2006 |pmid=17171441 |doi=10.1007/s11060-006-9303-1}}</ref>
* The tumor cells are very resistant to conventional therapies
* The brain is susceptible to damage due to conventional therapy
* The brain has a very limited capacity to repair itself
* Many drugs cannot cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] to act on the tumor

Treatment of primary brain tumors and brain metastases consists of both symptomatic
and palliative therapies.

===Symptomatic therapy===
Supportive treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving the patient’s
neurologic function. The primary supportive agents are [[anticonvulsant]]s and
[[corticosteroid]]s.

*Historically, around 90% of patients with glioblastoma underwent anticonvulsant treatment, although it has been estimated that only approximately 40% of patients required this treatment. Recently, it has been recommended that neurosurgeons not administer anticonvulsants prophylactically, and should wait until a seizure occurs before prescribing this medication.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stevens |first1=Glen H. J. |title=Antiepileptic therapy in patients with central nervous system malignancies |journal=Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=311–318 |year=2006 |pmid=16822352 |doi=10.1007/s11910-006-0024-9}}</ref> Those receiving [[phenytoin]] concurrent with radiation may have serious skin reactions such as [[erythema multiforme]] and [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]].

*Corticosteroids, usually [[dexamethasone]] given 4 to 8&nbsp;mg every 4 to 6 h, can reduce peritumoral edema (through rearrangement of the blood–brain barrier), diminishing mass effect and lowering intracranial pressure, with a decrease in headache or drowsiness.

===Palliative therapy===
Palliative treatment usually is conducted to improve quality of life and to achieve a longer survival time. It includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A maximally feasible resection with maximal tumor-free margins is usually performed along with external beam [[radiation]] and [[chemotherapy]].  Gross total resection of tumor is associated with a better prognosis.

====Surgery====
Surgery is the first stage of treatment of glioblastoma. An average GBM tumor contains 10<sup>11</sup> cells, which is on average reduced to 10<sup>9</sup> cells after surgery (a reduction of 99%).
It is used to take a section for a pathological diagnosis, to remove some of the symptoms of a large mass pressing against the brain, to remove disease before secondary resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and to prolong survival.

The greater the extent of tumor removal, the better. Removal of 98% or more of the tumor has been associated with a significantly longer healthier time than if less than 98% of the tumor is removed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lacroix |first1=Michel |last2=Abi-Said |first2=Dima |last3=Fourney |first3=Daryl R. |last4=Gokaslan |first4=Ziya L. |last5=Shi |first5=Weiming |last6=Demonte |first6=Franco |last7=Lang |first7=Frederick F. |last8=McCutcheon |first8=Ian E. |last9=Hassenbusch |first9=Samuel J. |title=A multivariate analysis of 416 patients with glioblastoma multiforme: prognosis, extent of resection, and survival |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=95 |issue=2 |pages=190–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11780887 |doi=10.3171/jns.2001.95.2.0190}}</ref> The chances of near-complete initial removal of the tumor can be greatly increased if the surgery is guided by a fluorescent dye known as [[5-aminolevulinic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stummer |first1=W |last2=Pichlmeier |first2=U |last3=Meinel |first3=T |last4=Wiestler |first4=O |last5=Zanella |first5=F |last6=Reulen |first6=H |last7=Ala-Glioma Study |first7=Group |title=Fluorescence-guided surgery with 5-aminolevulinic acid for resection of malignant glioma: a randomised controlled multicentre phase III trial |journal=The Lancet Oncology |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=392–401 |year=2006 |pmid=16648043 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(06)70665-9}}</ref> GBM cells are widely infiltrative through the brain at diagnosis, and so despite a "total resection" of all obvious tumor, most people with GBM later develop recurrent tumors either near the original site or at more distant "satellite lesions" within the brain. Other modalities, including radiation, are used after surgery in an effort to suppress and slow recurrent disease.

====Radiotherapy====
After surgery, radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for people with glioblastoma. A pivotal clinical trial carried out in the early 1970s showed that among 303 GBM patients randomized to radiation or nonradiation therapy, those who received radiation had a median survival more than double those who did not.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=Michael D. |last2=Alexander |first2=Eben |last3=Hunt |first3=William E. |last4=MacCarty |first4=Collin S. |last5=Mahaley |first5=M.

On average, [[radiotherapy]] after surgery can reduce the tumor size to 10<sup>7</sup> cells.

GBM tumors are well known to contain zones of tissue exhibiting [[hypoxia (medical)]] which are highly resistant to radiotherapy.  Various approaches to chemotherapy radiosensitizers have been pursued with limited success to date.   Newer research approaches are currently being studied, including preclinical and clinical investigations into the use of an [[oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound]] such as [[trans sodium crocetinate]] (TSC) as [[radiosensitizer]]s<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sheehan JP, Shaffrey ME, Gupta B, Larner J, Rich JN, Park D |title=Improving the radiosensitivity of radioresistant and hypoxic glioblastoma |journal= Future Oncology |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=1591–1601 |year=2010 | doi=10.2217/fon.10.123 |pmid=21062158}}</ref> and a clinical trial is currently underway.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01465347?term=tsc&rank=4 | publisher = [[ClinicalTrials.gov]] | date = November 2011 | title = Safety and Efficacy Study of Trans Sodium Crocetinate (TSC) With Concomitant Radiation Therapy and Temozolomide in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma (GBM)}}</ref>

[[Boron neutron capture therapy]] has been tested as an alternative treatment for glioblastoma multiforme but is not in common use.

====Chemotherapy====
In other cancers where radiation can prolong survival or even cure tumors, the addition of chemotherapy to radiation improves survival over radiation treatment alone. Examples include cervical cancer, throat cancer and others. Because of this, several large clinical trials took place in which it was hoped survival of GBM patients might be improved with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation. Most of these studies showed no benefit from the addition of chemotherapy. However, a large clinical trial of 575 participants randomized to standard radiation versus radiation plus [[temozolomide]] chemotherapy showed that the group receiving temozolomide survived a median of 14.6 months as opposed to 12.1 months for the group receiving radiation alone.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stupp |first1=Roger |last2=Mason |first2=Warren P. |last3=Van Den Bent |first3=Martin J. |last4=Weller |first4=Michael |last5=Fisher |first5=Barbara |last6=Taphoorn |first6=Martin J.B. |last7=Belanger |first7=Karl |last8=Brandes |first8=Alba A. |last9=Marosi |first9=Christine |title=Radiotherapy plus Concomitant and Adjuvant Temozolomide for Glioblastoma |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=10 |pages=987–996 |year=2005 |pmid=15758009 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa043330}}</ref> This treatment regime is now standard for most cases of glioblastoma where the patient is not enrolled in a [[clinical trial]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mason |first1=Warren P. |last2=Mirimanoff |first2=René O. |last3=Stupp |first3=Roger |title=Radiotherapy with Concurrent and Adjuvant Temozolomide: A New Standard of Care for Glioblastoma Multiforme |journal=Progress in Neurotherapeutics and Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=1 |pages=37–52 |year=2006 |doi=10.1017/S1748232105000054}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/results/glioblastoma0604 |title=Temozolomide Plus Radiation Helps Brain Cancer – National Cancer Institute |accessdate=2007-09-15 }}</ref> Temozolomide seems to work by sensitizing the tumor cells to radiation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chamberlain |first1=Marc C. |last2=Glantz |first2=Michael J. |last3=Chalmers |first3=Lisa |last4=Horn |first4=Alixis |last5=Sloan |first5=Andrew E. |title=Early necrosis following concurrent Temodar and radiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma |journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=81–3 |year=2006 |pmid=16944309 |doi=10.1007/s11060-006-9241-y}}</ref> 

High doses of temozolomide in high-grade gliomas yield low toxicity, but the results are comparable to the standard doses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dall’oglio |first1=Stefano |last2=D’amico |first2=Anna |last3=Pioli |first3=Fabio |last4=Gabbani |first4=Milena |last5=Pasini |first5=Felice |last6=Passarin |first6=Maria Grazia |last7=Talacchi |first7=Andrea |last8=Turazzi |first8=Sergio |last9=Maluta |first9=Sergio |title=Dose-intensity temozolomide after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in operated high-grade gliomas |journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=315–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18688571 |doi=10.1007/s11060-008-9663-9}}</ref>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved [[Avastin]] (bevacizumab) to treat patients with glioblastoma at progression after standard therapy based on the results of two studies that showed Avastin reduced tumor size in some glioblastoma patients. In the first study, 28% of glioblastoma patients had tumor shrinkage, 38% survived for at least one year, and 43% survived for at least six months without their disease progressing.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2009/NEW02014.html FDA Approves Drug for Treatment of Aggressive Brain Cancer]</ref> Unlike the case for colon cancer, lung cancer and other cancers where bevacizumab acts by potentiating chemotherapy, the studies leading to approval showed that in GBM, the addition of chemotherapy to bevacizumab did not improve on results from bevacizumab alone. Bevacizumab reduces brain edema and consequent symptoms, and it may be that the benefit from this drug is due to its action against edema rather than any action against the tumor itself. Some patients with brain edema do not actually have any active tumor remaining, but rather develop the edema as a late effect of prior radiation treatment. This type of edema is difficult to distinguish from that due to tumor, and both may coexist. Both respond to bevacizumab.

====Gene transfer====
Gene transfer is a promising approach for fighting cancers including brain cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fulci |first1=Giulia |last2=Chiocca|first2=Antonio|title=The status of gene therapy for brain tumors|journal=Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1517/14712598.7.2.197 |volume=7|issue=2|pages=197–208|year=2007|doi=10.1517/14712598.7.2.197 |pmid=17250458 |pmc=2819130}}</ref> Unlike current conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, gene transfer has the potential to selectively kill cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed.  Over the past two decades significant advances have been made in gene transfer technology and the field has matured to the point of clinical and commercial feasibility.  Advances include vector (gene delivery vehicle) construction, vector producer cell efficiency and scale-up processes, preclinical models for target diseases and regulatory guidance regarding clinical trial design including endpoint definitions and measurements. In one such approach, researchers at UCLA in 2005 reported a long-term survival benefit in an experimental brain tumor animal model.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tai |first1=Chien-Kuo |last2=Jun Wang|first2=Wei|last3=Chen |first3=Thomas C.|last4= Kasahara|first4=Noriyuki|title=Single-Shot, Multicycle Suicide Gene Therapy by Replication-Competent Retrovirus Vectors Achieves Long-Term Survival Benefit in Experimental Glioma|journal=Molecular Therapy |url=http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v12/n5/full/mt20051365a.html|volume=12|pages=842–851|year=2005|doi=10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.03.017 |issue=5 |pmid=16257382}}</ref> Subsequently, in preparation for human clinical trials, this technology was further developed by Tocagen Inc.,<ref>http://www.Tocagen.com</ref> and is currently under clinical investigation in a Phase I/II trial for the potential treatment of recurrent high grade glioma including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01156584 | publisher = [[ClinicalTrials.gov]] | date = January 2011 | title = A Study of a Replication Competent Retrovirus Administered to Subjects With Recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM) }}</ref>

===MicroRNA===
RNA interference, usually micro-RNA, is being studied in tissue culture and pathology specimens. MicroRNA-screening of [[Blood plasma|plasma]] is used to determine the prognosis of glioblastoma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Møller HG, Rasmussen AP, Andersen HH, Johnsen KB, Henriksen M, Duroux M |title=A Systematic Review of MicroRNA in Glioblastoma Multiforme: Micro-modulators in the Mesenchymal Mode of Migration and Invasion |journal=Mol.

====APG101====
[[APG101]] is a CD95-Fc fusion protein. In a randomized phase II trial, 49 patients were given APG101 and 22 radiation alone. Of them, 9 patients on APG01 and none on radiation alone achieved 6-months progression-free survival.<ref>[http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=114&abstractID=97870 J Clin Oncol 30, 2012 (suppl; abstr 2034)]</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01071837 | title = APG101 in Glioblastoma | publisher = [[ClinicalTrials.gov]] | accessdate = 2012-06-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.ccr.2008.02.003}}</ref>

====Immunotherapy====
Relapse of glioblastoma is attributed to the recurrence and persistence of tumor stem cells.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ghebeh |first1=H |last2=Bakr |first2=MM |last3=Dermime |first3=S |title=Cancer stem cell immunotherapy: the right bullet for the right target |journal=Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–2 |year=2008 |pmid=20063521}}</ref> In a small trial, a tumor B-cell hybridoma vaccine against tumor stem cells elicited a specific tumor immune reaction thus enhancing immune response to the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moviglia |first1=GA |last2=Carrizo |first2=AG |last3=Varela |first3=G |last4=Gaeta |first4=CA |last5=Paes De Lima |first5=A |last6=Farina |first6=P |last7=Molina |first7=H |title=Preliminary report on tumor stem cell/B cell hybridoma vaccine for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme |journal=Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=3–13 |year=2008 |pmid=20063522}}</ref> Larger trials, including tests of different EGFR signaling patterns and their relationship to tumor stem cells being conducted by [[John A. Boockvar]]'s lab at [[Weill Cornell Medical College]], are in progress to further assess this approach to treating glioblastoma.

====Alternating electrical fields====
{{Main|Tumor Treating Fields}}
Research is underway using alternating electric fields to destroy dividing globlastoma cells. 237 patients with relapsed GBM were randomized to alternating electric fields (with the Novo-TFF device) or standard treatment. Alternating electric fields were no better than standard treatment in prolonging survival.<ref>[http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/18_suppl/LBA2007?sid=5f685533-dbae-4af2-b627-0a9122c7c619 A prospective, randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial of NovoTTF-100A versus best standard of care chemotherapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. – Stupp et al. 28 (18): LBA2007 – ASCO Meeting Abstracts]. Meeting.ascopubs.org (2010-06-20). Retrieved on 2010-10-19.</ref> A currently open clinical trial for people with newly diagnosed GBM is exploring whether the addition of the Novo-TTF device to standard radiation and temozolomide treatment improves survival over standard treatment alone.<ref>http://www.cancer.gov/search/ViewClinicalTrials.aspx?cdrid=647437&version=HealthProfessional&protocolsearchid=8237659</ref>

==Prognosis==
The median survival time from the time of diagnosis without any treatment is 3 months, but with treatment survival of 1–2 years is common.  Increasing age (> 60 years of age) carries a worse prognostic risk. Death is usually due to [[cerebral edema]] or increased [[intracranial pressure]].<ref name="doi101093brainawm204">{{cite journal |last1=Krex |first1=D. |last2=Klink |first2=B. |last3=Hartmann |first3=C. |last4=Von Deimling |first4=A. |last5=Pietsch |first5=T. |last6=Simon |first6=M. |last7=Sabel |first7=M. |last8=Steinbach |first8=J.

A good initial [[Karnofsky score|Karnofsky Performance Score]] (KPS), and [[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]] [[methylation]] are associated with longer survival.<ref name="doi101093brainawm204"/> A DNA test can be conducted on glioblastomas to determine whether or not the [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] of the MGMT [[gene]] is [[methylated]]. Patients with a methylated MGMT promoter have been associated with significantly greater long-term benefit than patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martinez |first1=Ramon |last2=Schackert |first2=Gabriele |last3=Yaya-Tur |first3=Ricard |last4=Rojas-Marcos |first4=Iñigo |last5=Herman |first5=James G. |last6=Esteller |first6=Manel |title=Frequent hypermethylation of the DNA repair gene MGMT in long-term survivors of glioblastoma multiforme |journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=91–3 |year=2006 |pmid=17164975 |doi=10.1007/s11060-006-9292-0}}</ref> This DNA characteristic is intrinsic to the patient and currently cannot be altered externally.

Long-term benefits have also been associated with those patients who receive surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy.<ref name="doi101093brainawm204"/> However, much remains unknown about why some patients survive longer with glioblastoma. Age of under 50 is linked to longer survival in glioblastoma multiforme, as is 98%+ resection and use of temozolomide chemotherapy and better Karnofsky performance scores. A recent study confirms how younger age is associated with a much better prognosis, with a small fraction of patients under 40 years of age achieving a population-based cure. The population-based cure is thought to occur when a population's risk of death returns to that of the normal population, and in GBM, this is thought to occur after 10 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smoll|first=Nicolas|coauthors=Schaller, K; Gautschi OP|title=The Cure Fraction of Glioblastoma Multiforme|journal=Neuroepidemiology|year=2012|volume=39|issue=1}}</ref>

According to a 2003 study, glioblastoma multiforme prognosis can be divided into three subgroups dependent on KPS, the age of the patient, and treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shaw |first1=E |last2=Seiferheld |first2=W |last3=Scott |first3=C |last4=Coughlin |first4=C |last5=Leibel |first5=S |last6=Curran |first6=W |last7=Mehta |first7=M |title=Reexamining the radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients |journal=International Journal of Radiation OncologyBiologyPhysics |volume=57 |pages=S135–6 |year=2003 |doi=10.1016/S0360-3016(03)00843-5 |issue=2}}</ref>
