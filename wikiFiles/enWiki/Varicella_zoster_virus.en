'''Varicella zoster virus''' ('''VZV''') is one of eight [[Herpesviridae|herpes viruses]] known to infect humans and  vertebrates. It commonly causes [[chicken-pox]] in children, teens and young adults and [[herpes zoster|herpes zoster (shingles)]] in adults and rarely in children.

==Nomenclature==
VZV is known by many names, including:  chickenpox virus, varicella virus, zoster virus, and human herpes virus type 3 (HHV-3).

==Human disease==
{{main|Chickenpox}}
Primary VZV infection results in [[chickenpox]] (varicella), which may rarely result in complications including [[encephalitis]] or [[pneumonia]]. Even when clinical symptoms of chickenpox have resolved, VZV remains dormant in the [[nervous system]] of the infected person  ([[virus latency]]), in the [[trigeminal nerve|trigeminal]] and [[dorsal root ganglion|dorsal root ganglia]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Lancet Neurol |year=2007 |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=1015–28 |title= The neurotropic herpes viruses: herpes simplex and varicella-zoster |author= Steiner I | coauthors = Kennedy PG; Pachner AR |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70267-3 |pmid=17945155}}</ref> In about 10–20% of cases, VZV reactivates later in life producing a disease known as [[herpes zoster|shingles or herpes zoster]].  VZV is more likely to reactivate in patients with severely compromised immune systems, such as AIDS patients.  Serious complications of shingles include [[postherpetic neuralgia]], zoster multiplex, myelitis, herpes ophthalmicus, or zoster sine herpete. [[Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II|Ramsay Hunt syndrome]];  VZV rarely affects the geniculate ganglion giving lesions that follow specific branches of the facial nerve. Symptoms may include painful blisters on the tongue and ear along with one sided facial weakness and hearing loss.

==Morphology==
VZV is closely related to the [[herpes simplex virus]]es (HSV), sharing much genome homology. The known envelope glycoproteins (gB, gC, gE, gH, gI, gK, gL) correspond with those in HSV; however, there is no equivalent of HSV gD. VZV also fails to produce the LAT (latency-associated transcripts) that play an important role in establishing HSV latency (herpes simplex virus). VZV virons are spherical and 180–200&nbsp;nm in diameter. Their lipid envelope encloses the 100&nbsp;nm nucleocapsid of 162 hexameric and pentameric capsomeres arranged in an icosahedral form. Its DNA is a single, linear, double-stranded molecule, 125,000&nbsp;nt long. The capsid is surrounded by a number of loosely associated proteins known collectively as the tegument; many of these proteins play critical roles in initiating the process of virus reproduction in the infected cell. The tegument is in turn covered by a lipid envelope studded with glycoproteins that are displayed on the exterior of the virion, each approximately 8&nbsp;nm long.

==Genome==
The genome is a linear duplex DNA molecule, a laboratory strain has 124,884 base pairs.  The genome has 2 predominant isomers, depending on the orientation of the S segment, P (prototype) and I<sub>S</sub> (inverted S) which are present with equal frequency for a total frequency of 90-95%.  The L segment can also be inverted resulting in a total of four linear isomers (I<sub>L</sub> and I<sub>LS</sub>).  This is distinct from HSV's equiprobable distribution, and the discriminatory mechanism is not known.  A small percentage of isolated molecules are circular genomes, about which little is known.  (It is known that HSV circularizes on infection.) There are at least 70 [[open reading frame]]s in the genome.  

There are at least five clades of this virus.<ref name=Chow2012>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.meegid.2012.11.008|noedit}}</ref> Clades 1 and 3 include European/North American strains; clade 2 are Asian strains, especially from Japan; and clade 5 appears to be based in [[India]]. Clade 4 includes some strains from Europe but its geographic origins need further clarification.

==Evolution==
Commonality with HSV1 and HSV2 indicates a common ancestor, five genes do not have corresponding HSV genes. Relation with other human hepesviruses is less strong, but many homologues and conserved gene blocks are still found.

There are five principle clades (1-5) and four genotypes that do not fit into these clades.<ref name=Grose2012>{{cite doi|10.1128/JVI.00357-12|noedit}}</ref> The current distribution of these clades is Asia (clades 1,2,and 5) and Europe (clades 1, 3 and 4). Allocation of VZV strains to clades required sequence of whole virus genome. Practically all molecular epidemiological data on global VZV strains distribution obtained with targeted sequencing of selected regions.  

Phylogenetic analysis of VZV genomic sequences resolves wild-type strains into 9 genotypes (E1, E2, J, M1, M2, M3, M4, VIII and IX).<ref name="9geno" >{{cite pmid|19019403|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1128.2FJVI.06233-11|noedit}}</ref> Complete sequences for M3 and M4 strains are unavailable, but targeted analyses of representative strains suggest they are stable, circulating VZV genotypes. Sequence analysis of VZV isolates identified both shared and specific markers for every genotype and validated a unified VZV genotyping strategy. Despite high genotype diversity no evidence for intra-genotypic recombination was observed. Five of seven VZV genotypes were reliably discriminated using only four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) present in ORF22, and the E1 and E2 genotypes were resolved using SNP located in ORF21, ORF22 or ORF50. Sequence analysis of 342 clinical varicella and zoster specimens from 18 European countries identified the following distribution of VZV genotypes: E1, 221 (65%); E2, 87 (25%); M1, 20 (6%); M2, 3 (1%); M4, 11 (3%). No M3 or J strains were observed.<ref name="9geno" /> Of 165 clinical varicella and zoster isolates from Australia and New Zealand typed using this approach, 67 of 127 eastern Australian isolates were E1, 30 were E2, 16 were J, 10 were M1, and 4 were M2; 25 of 38 New Zealand isolates were E1, 8 were E2, and 5 were M1.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1128/JVI.01145-07|noedit}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Within the human body it can be treated by a number of drugs and therapeutic agents including [[aciclovir]] for the chicken pox, [[famciclovir]], [[valaciclovir]] for the shingles, [[zoster-immune globulin]] (ZIG), and [[vidarabine]]. [[VZV immune globulin]] is also a treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|title=FDA approval of an extended period for administering VariZIG for postexposure prophylaxis of varicella|journal=[[MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep.]]|volume=61|issue=12|page=212|year=2012|month=March |pmid=22456121|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6112.pdf|author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref>

==Vaccination==
{{main|varicella vaccine|Zostavax}}
A live attenuated VZV Oka/Merck strain [[vaccine]] is available and is marketed in the United States under the trade name ''Varivax''. It was developed by [[Merck & Co.|Merck, Sharp & Dohme]] in the 1980s from the Oka strain virus isolated and attenuated by Michiaki Takahashi and colleagues in the 1970s. It was submitted to the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] for approval in 1990 and was approved in 1995. Since then, it has been added to the recommended vaccination schedules for children in [[Australia]], the United States, and many other countries.  Varicella vaccination has raised concerns in some that the immunity induced by the vaccine may not be lifelong, possibly leaving adults vulnerable to more severe disease as the immunity from their childhood immunization wanes.  Vaccine coverage in the United States in the population recommended for vaccination is approaching 90%, with concomitant reductions in the incidence of varicella cases and hospitalizations and deaths due to VZV. So far, clinical data has proved that the vaccine is effective for over 10 years in preventing varicella infection in healthy individuals and when breakthrough infections do occur, illness is typically mild.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Prevention of varicella: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

In 2006, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[Zostavax]] for the prevention of shingles.  Zostavax is a more concentrated formulation of the Varivax vaccine, designed to elicit an immune response in older adults whose immunity to VZV wanes with advancing age. A systematic review by the [[Cochrane Library]] shows that Zostavax reduces the incidence of shingles by almost 50%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gagliardi AM, Gomes Silva BN, Torloni MR, Soares BG |title=Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=10 |issue= |pages=CD008858 |year=2012 |pmid=23076951 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008858.pub2 |editor1-last=Gagliardi |editor1-first=Anna MZ}}</ref>
