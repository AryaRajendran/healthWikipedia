Because the [[rosette inhibition assay]] for EPF is indirect, substances that have similar effects may confound the test.  [[Pig semen]], like EPF, has been shown to inhibit rosette formation - the rosette inhibition test was positive for one day in sows mated with a vasectomized boar, but not in sows similarly stimulated without semen exposure.<!--

==Origin and function==
Early embryos are not believed to directly produce EPF.  Rather, embryos are believed to produce some other chemical that induces the maternal system to create EPF.<!--

==Clinical utility==
===Pregnancy testing===
In 1979, it was suggested that EPF could be used as a marker for a very [[early pregnancy test]], and as a way to monitor the viability of ongoing pregnancies in livestock.<ref name="sheep1979" />  Interest in EPF for this purpose has continued,<!--

In humans, modern [[pregnancy test]]s detect [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG).  hCG is not present until after implantation, which occurs six to twelve days after fertilization.<!--

===Birth control research===
EPF may also be used to determine whether pregnancy prevention mechanism of [[birth control]] methods act before or after fertilization.  A 1982 study evaluating EPF levels in women with [[Intrauterine device|IUDs]] concluded that post-fertilization mechanisms contribute significantly{{quantify|date=August 2008}}  to the effectiveness of these devices.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Smart Y, Fraser I, Clancy R, Roberts T, Cripps A | title = Early pregnancy factor as a monitor for fertilization in women wearing intrauterine devices | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–4 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6174375}}</ref>  However, more recent evidence, such as tubal flushing studies indicates that IUDs work by inhibiting fertilization, acting earlier in the reproductive process than previously thought.<ref name=CT-IUD>{{cite book |author=Grimes, David |year=2007 |chapter=Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) |editor=Hatcher, Robert A., et al. |title=Contraceptive Technology |edition=19th rev. |location=New York |publisher=Ardent Media |isbn=0-9664902-0-7 |page=120}}</ref>

For groups that define [[beginning of pregnancy controversy|pregnancy as beginning with fertilization]], birth control methods that have postfertilization mechanisms are regarded as [[abortifacient]].  There is currently contention over whether [[hormonal contraception]] methods have post-fertilization methods, specifically the most popular hormonal method - the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] (COCP).  The group Pharmicists for Life has called for a large-scale clinical trial to evaluate EPF in women taking COCPs; this would be the most conclusive evidence available to determine whether COCPs have postfertilization mechanisms.<!--

===Infertility and early pregnancy loss===
EPF is useful when investigating embryo loss prior to implantation.  One study in healthy human women seeking pregnancy detected fourteen pregnancies with EPF.  Of these, six were [[Spontaneous abortion|lost]] within ten days of [[ovulation]] (43% rate of early conceptus loss).<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Smart Y, Fraser I, Roberts T, Clancy R, Cripps A | title = Fertilization and early pregnancy loss in healthy women attempting conception | journal = Clin Reprod Fertil | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 177–84 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6196101}}</ref>

Use of EPF has been proposed to distinguish infertility caused by failure to conceive versus infertility caused by failure to implant.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal | author = Mesrogli M, Maas D, Schneider J | title = Early abortion rate in sterility patients: early pregnancy factor as a parameter | journal = Zentralbl Gynakol | volume = 110 | issue = 9 | pages = 555–61 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3407357}}</ref>  EPF has also been proposed as a marker of viable pregnancy, more useful in distinguishing ectopic or other nonviable pregnancies than other chemical markers such as hCG and [[progesterone]].<!--

A study of EPF in women taking [[clomifene]] to treat infertility found fertilization rates of about 40%-50% per cycle.  In cycles where fertilization was detected, nearly 80% resulted in subclinical embryonic loss, a rate much higher than that found in healthy women.<!--

A study of EPF in women undergoing [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) concluded that, while a significant number{{quantify|date=August 2008}}  of embryos simply failed to implant, an equally significant number of embryos were likely damaged or killed by the transfer process itself.  The researchers used these findings to call for more attention to the effective transfer of embryos during IVF procedures.<!--
