'''Birth weight''' is the [[body weight]] of a [[infant|baby]] at its [[childbirth|birth]].<ref>[http://oasis.state.ga.us/oasis/help/mch.html Definitions] from Georgia Department of Public Health. Date: 12/04/2008. Original citation: "Birthweight: Infant's weight recorded at the time of birth"</ref> 

There have been numerous studies that have attempted, with varying degrees of success, to show links between birth weight and later-life conditions, including [[diabetes]], [[obesity]], [[tobacco smoking]] and [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].

==Determinants==
There are basically two distinct determinants for birth weight:
*The duration of gestation prior to birth, that is, the [[gestational age]] at which the child is born
[[File:Weight vs gestational Age.jpg|thumb|Relation of weight and [[gestational age]].]]
*The [[prenatal growth rate]], generally measured in relation to what weight is expected for any gestational age.

The incidence of birth weight being outside what is normal is influenced by the parents in numerous ways, including:
*[[Genetics]]
*The [[health]] of the mother, particularly during the pregnancy
*Environmental factors, including exposure of the mother to [[secondhand smoke]]<ref name="sg-report">{{cite web | url = http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke | title = The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General | publisher = [[Surgeon General of the United States]] | date = 2006-06-27 | accessdate = 2009-02-07}} pp.&nbsp;198&ndash;205</ref>
*Economic status of the parents gives inconsistent study findings according to a review on 2010, and remains speculative as a determinant.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Margerison Zilko CE |title=Economic contraction and birth outcomes: an integrative review |journal=Hum Reprod Update |volume= 16|issue= 4|pages= 445–458|year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20085917 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmp059 |url=}}</ref>
*Other factors, like multiple births, where each baby is likely to be outside the AGA, one more so than the other

==Abnormalities==
*A [[low birth weight]] can be caused either by a [[preterm birth]] (low gestational age at birth) or of the infant being [[small for gestational age]] (slow prenatal growth rate), or a combination of both.
*A very large birth weight is usually caused by the infant having been [[large for gestational age]]

==Influence on adult life==
Studies have been conducted to investigate how a person's birth weight can influence aspects of their future life. This includes theorised links with [[obesity]], [[diabetes]] and [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].

===Obesity===
A baby born small or large for gestational age (either of the two extremes) is thought to have an increased risk of [[obesity]] in later life,<ref name="title3 stages of childhood may predict obesity risk - Fitness - MSNBC.com">{{cite web |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8088161/ |title=3 stages of childhood may predict obesity risk - Fitness - MSNBC.com |accessdate=2007-11-28 |format= |work=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Singhal A, Wells J, Cole TJ, Fewtrell M, Lucas A |title=Programming of lean body mass: a link between birth weight, obesity, and cardiovascular disease? |journal=Am J Clin Nutr. |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=726–30 |date=1 March 2003|pmid=12600868 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/77/3/726 }}</ref> but it was also shown that this relationship is fully explained by maternal weight.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Parsons TJ, Power C, Manor O |title=Fetal and early life growth and body mass index from birth to early adulthood in 1958 British cohort: longitudinal study |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |issue=7325 |pages=1331–5 |year=2001 |month= December|pmid=11739217 |pmc=60670 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7325/1331 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7325.1331}}</ref>

GH therapy at a certain dose induced catch-up of lean body mass (LBM). However percentage body fat decreased in the GH-treated subjects. Bone mineral density SDS measured by DEXA increased significantly in the GH-treated group compared to the untreated subjects, though there is much debate over whether or not SGA (small for gestational age) is significantly adverse to children to warrant inducing catch-up.<ref>{{cite journal |title=GH Treatment Effects on Body Composition in SGA |journal=Growth, Genetics & Hormones |volume=24 |issue=1 |month=May |year=2008 |url=http://gghjournal.com/volume24/1/ab13.cfm}}</ref>

===Diabetes===
Babies that have a low birth weight are thought to have an increased risk of developing type 2 [[diabetes]] in later life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4293509.stm |title=  Low birth weight diabetes link |accessdate=2007-11-28 |format= |work=BBC News | date=2005-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gillman MW, Rifas-Shiman S, Berkey CS, Field AE, Colditz GA |title=Maternal gestational diabetes, birth weight, and adolescent obesity |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=e221–6 |year=2003 |month= March|pmid=12612275 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/111/3/e221 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.3.e221}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rich-Edwards JW |title=Birthweight and the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult women |journal=Ann Intern Med. |volume=130 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=278–84 |year=1999 |pmid=10068385 |author-separator=, |author2=Colditz GA |author3=Stampfer MJ |display-authors=3 |last4=Willett |first4=WC |last5=Gillman |first5=MW |last6=Hennekens |first6=CH |last7=Speizer |first7=FE |last8=Manson |first8=JE }}</ref>

===Intelligence===
Some studies have shown a direct link between an increased birth weight and an increased [[intelligence quotient]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Matte TD, Bresnahan M, Begg MD, Susser E |title=Influence of variation in birth weight within normal range and within sibships on IQ at age 7 years: cohort study |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |issue=7308 |pages=310–4 |year=2001 |month= August|pmid=11498487 |pmc=37317 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11498487 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7308.310}}</ref><ref name="titleThe Future of Children - Sub-Sections">{{cite web |url=http://www.futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=256519 |title=The Future of Children - Sub-Sections |accessdate=2007-11-28 |format= |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071022213938/http://futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=256519 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1483134.stm |title=HEALTH &#124; Intelligence linked to birthweight |accessdate=2007-11-28  |work=BBC News | date=2001-08-09}}</ref>
