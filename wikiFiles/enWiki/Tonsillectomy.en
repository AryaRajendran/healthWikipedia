'''Tonsillectomy''' is a 3,000-year-old<ref name=McNeill1960/>  [[list of surgical procedures|surgical procedure]] in which, traditionally, each [[tonsil]] is removed from a recess in the side of the [[pharynx]] called the tonsillar fossa. The procedure is performed in response to repeated occurrence of acute [[tonsillitis]], [[obstructive sleep apnea]], nasal [[airway obstruction]], [[diphtheria carrier state]], [[snoring]], or [[peritonsillar abscess]]. For children, the [[adenoid]]s are usually removed at the same time, a procedure called [[adenoidectomy]], or tonsilloadenoidectomy, when combined. Adenoidectomy is uncommon in adults in whom the adenoids are usually [[vestigial organs|vestigial]]. Although tonsillectomy is performed less frequently than in the 1950s, it remains one of the most common surgical procedures in children in the United States.

==Indications==
Tonsillectomy may be indicated when the patient experiences recurrent infections of acute [[tonsillitis]].  The number prompting tonsillectomy varies with the severity of the episodes. One case, even severe, is generally not enough for most surgeons to decide tonsillectomy is necessary. [[Jack Paradise|Paradise]] in 1983 defined recurrent tonsillitis warranting surgery by the attack frequency standard as 

<blockquote>"Seven or more in a year, five or more per year for two years, or three or more per year for three years. These are the absolute indications for tonsillectomy."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paradise JL|title=Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy|journal=Pediatric otolaryngology |issue= |pages=122–6 |year=1983 |url=http://www.iapo.org.br/manuals/14-1.pdf |unused_data=Paediatric ENT Manuel}}</ref></blockquote> 
According to the 2012 guidelines of the [[American Academy of Otolaryngology|American Academy of Otolaryngology & Head and Neck Surgery]] (AAO-HNS), tonsillectomy is indicated as follows: 
<blockquote>"Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and one or more of the following: temperature >38.3oC, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, or positive test for Group A Beta- hemolytic strep."''<ref>[http://www.entnet.org/Practice/indicators/tonsillectomy.html American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery. 2012 Clinical Indicators Compendium. Clinical Indicators: Tonsillectomy, Adenoidectomy, Adenotonillectomy.]</ref></blockquote>

Most recently, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published clinical practice guidelines.<ref name=guidelines>{{cite journal | title=Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children | author=Baugh RF, Archer SM, Mitchell RB, Rosenfeld RM, Amin R, Burns JJ, Darrow DH, Giordano T, Litman RS, Li KK, Mannix ME, Schwartz RH, Setzen G, Wald ER, Wall E, Sandberg G, Patel MM | date=2011 Jan | journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg | volume=144(1 Suppl) | pages=S1-30 }}</ref>
The panel made a strong recommendation for: 
# Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been fewer than 7 episodes in the past year or fewer than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years or fewer than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years; 
# Assessing the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergy/intolerance, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis, or history of peritonsillar abscess; 
# Asking caregivers of children with sleep-disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, and behavioral problems; 
# Counseling caregivers about tonsillectomy as a means to improve health in children with abnormal polysomnography who also have tonsil hypertrophy and sleep-disordered breathing; 
# Counseling caregivers that sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management; 
# Advocating for pain management after tonsillectomy and educating caregivers about the importance of managing and reassessing pain; and 
# Clinicians who perform tonsillectomy should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy hemorrhage at least annually.

==Effectiveness==

The effectiveness of the tonsillectomy for sore throat has been questioned in a 2009 [[systematic review]] of 7765 papers, published in ''Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery''. The review found that the procedure was most likely not effective all the time, but rather was modestly effective, and that not a single paper reported that tonsillectomy is invariably effective in eliminating sore throats.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blakley, BW, Magit A|title=Response to: The role of tonsillectomy in reducing recurrent pharyngitis: A systematic review, from Jeremy Hornibrook|journal=Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery|volume=141 |issue=1 |pages=155–156 |year=2009 |url=http://www.otojournal.org/article/S0194-5998%2809%2900306-4/fulltext |doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2009.04.017}}</ref> Another systematic review of cases involving children found that there was only a short-term benefit:"'A child who meets these strict criteria will probably suffer from 6 throat infections in the next two years. A child who has surgery now will probably suffer from 3 throat infections. In two years there will probably be no difference."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marshall T|title=Effectiveness of tonsillectomy? A reply to Howel et al.|journal=Family Practice|volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=707–708 |year=2002 |url=http://fampra.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/19/6/707-a#R1 |doi=10.1093/fampra/19.6.707-a |pmid=12429681}}</ref>

==Frequency==

More than 530,000 procedures are performed annually in children younger than 15 years in the United States.<ref name= guidelines/> The current tonsillectomy "rate" is 0.53 per thousand children and 1.46 per thousand children for combined tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Changes and consistencies in the epidemiology of pediatric adenotonsillar surgery | author=Bhattacharyya N, Lin HW | date=2010 Nov | journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg | volume=43(5) | pages=680–4}}</ref>

==Morbidity and mortality==

The [[morbidity]] rate associated with tonsillectomy is 2% to 4% due to post-operative bleeding; the [[mortality rate]] is 1 in 15,000, due to bleeding, airway obstruction, or [[anesthesia]] complications.<ref>Lee KL, p. 544.</ref>

==Post-operative care==
A sore throat will persist approximately two weeks following surgery while pain following the procedure is significant and may necessitate a hospital stay.<ref name="Pediatric ENT">{{cite book|last=Graham|first=John M. |coauthors=Glenis K. Scadding, Peter D. Bull|title=Pediatric ENT|publisher=Springer|year=2008|page=136|isbn=3-540-69930-9}}</ref> Recovery can take from 7 to 10 days and proper hydration is very important during this time, since [[dehydration]] can increase throat pain, leading to a [[Positive feedback|vicious circle]] of poor fluid intake.<ref name="medical-surgical nursing">{{cite book|last=Timby|first=Barbara Kuhn |coauthors=Nancy Ellen Smith|title=Introductory medical-surgical nursing|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2006|page=357|isbn=0-7817-8032-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Pemberton|first=Cecilia M. |title=Mayo Clinic diet manual|publisher=B.C. Decker|year=1988|isbn=1-55664-032-3}}</ref>

At some point, most commonly 7&ndash;11 days after the surgery (but occasionally as long as two weeks (14 days) after), bleeding can occur when [[Wound healing#Proliferative phase|scabs]] begin sloughing off from the surgical sites. The overall risk of bleeding is approximately 1%&ndash;2%. It is higher in adults, especially males over age 70 and three quarters of bleeding incidents occur on the same day as the surgery.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Windfuhr JP, Chen YS, Remmert S. | title=Hemorrhage following tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in 15,218 patients | journal=Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery | year=2005 | pages=281–86 | volume=132 | issue=2 | pmid=15692542 | doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2004.09.007}}</ref> Approximately 3% of adult patients develop significant bleeding at this time which may sometimes require surgical intervention.

Post-operative pain relief is subject to change. Traditionally, pain relief has been provided by relatively mild narcotic analgesics such as Acetaminophen with codeine, for milder pain, and stronger narcotic analgesics for more severe pain. Recently (January 2011), the FDA reduced the recommended total 24 hour dose because of concern about liver toxicity from the Acetominophen component. An alternative is the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, themselves giving rise to concerns that their effect on platelets might increase the risk of post-operative bleeding.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the risk of operative site bleeding after tonsillectomy: a quantitative systematic review | author=Møiniche S, Rømsing J, Dahl JB, Tramèr MR | date=2003 Jan| journal=Anesth Analg | volume=96(1) | pages=68–77 }}</ref> In turn, this has renewed interest in techniques other than traditional 'extra-capsular excision' in the hope that post-operative pain might be reduced.<ref>{{cite journal | title=comparison of cold knife tonsillectomy, radiofrequency excision and thermal welding tonsillectomy in children | author=Chimona T, Proimos E, Mamoulakis C, Tzanakakis M, Skoulakis CE, Papadakis CE | date=2008 Sep | journal=Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol | volume=72(9) | pages=1431–6 | pmid18620759= }}</ref>

Tonsillectomy appears to be more painful in adults than children, although there will be individual variations in response.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Postoperative pain after tonsillectomy—comparison of children and adults | author=Graumüller S, Laudien B | date=2003 Nov | journal=Advances in Pediatric ORL. Proceedings of the 8th International Congress of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology | volume=1254 | pages=469–72 }}</ref>

==Surgical procedure==
For the past 50 years at least, tonsillectomy has been performed by dissecting the tonsil from its surrounding [[fascia]], a so-called 'total' , or extra-capsular tonsillectomy. Problems include pain and bleeding leading to a recent resurgence in interest in sub-total tonsillectomy or 'tonsillotomy' which was popular 60–100 years ago, in an effort to reduce these complications.<ref name=intracapsular>{{cite journal | title=Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials Comparing Intracapsular Tonsillectomy With Total Tonsillectomy in a Pediatric Population | author=Walton J, Ebner Y, Stewart MG, April MM | year=2012 |  journal=Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg | volume=138(3) | pages=243–49 }}</ref> The generally accepted procedure for 'total' tonsillectomy uses a scalpel and blunt dissection or [[electrocautery]], although [[harmonic scalpel]]s or lasers have also been used. Bleeding is stopped with electrocautery, ligation by [[surgical sutures|sutures]], and the topical use of [[thrombin]], a protein that induces blood clotting.

It has already been stated that the benefits of tonsillectomy for sore throat are controversial and time limited. Consequently, the main question of importance becomes whether or not the benefits of subtotal tonsillectomy in obstructive sleep apnea are enduring.  It appears that this may be the case although most observers agree that further time and study is required.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The evolution of tonsil surgery and rethinking the surgical approach to obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children | author=Koempel JA, Solares CA, Koltai PJ | date=2006 Dec | journal=J Laryngol Otol | volume=120(12) | pages=993–1000 | pmid=16923328 }}</ref>

==Other methods==
The [[scalpel]] is the preferred surgical instrument of many [[Otolaryngology|ear, nose, and throat specialists]]. However, there are other techniques and a brief review of each follows:

*'''Dissection and snare method''': Removal of the tonsils by use of a forceps and scissors with a wire loop called a 'snare' was formerly the most common method practiced by [[otolaryngologist]]s, but has been largely replaced in favor of other techniques.  The procedure requires the [[patient]] to undergo [[general anesthesia]]; the tonsils are completely removed and the remaining tissue surface is cauterized.  The [[patient]] will leave with minimal post-operative [[bleeding]].
*'''[[Electrocautery]]''': Electrocautery uses electrical energy to separate the tonsillar tissue and assists in reducing [[blood]] loss through [[cauterization]]. Research has shown that the heat of electrocautery (400[[Celsius|°C]]) may result in thermal injury to surrounding [[cell (biology)|tissue]]. This may result in more discomfort during the postoperative period.
*''' Radiofrequency Ablation (see [[Coblation tonsillectomy]])''': This procedure produces an [[ionized]] [[saline (medicine)|saline]] layer that disrupts [[molecular bonds]] without using heat. As the energy is transferred to the tissue, ionic dissociation occurs. This mechanism can be used to remove all or only part of the tonsil. It is done under general anesthesia in the operating room and can be used for enlarged tonsils and chronic or recurrent infections. This causes removal of tissue with a thermal effect of 45-85&nbsp;°C. It has been claimed that this technique results in less pain, faster healing, and less post operative care.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Friedman M, LoSavio P, Ibrahim H, Ramakrishnan V |title=Radiofrequency tonsil reduction: safety, morbidity, and efficacy |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=113 |issue=5 |pages=882–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12792327 |doi=10.1097/00005537-200305000-00020}}</ref>  However, review of 21 studies gives conflicting results about levels of pain, and its comparative safety has yet to be confirmed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Windfuhr JP. |title=[Coblation tonsillectomy: a review of the literature.] |journal=HNO |volume= 55|issue=  5|year=2007 |pmid=17431570 | doi=10.1007/s00106-006-1523-3 |pages=337–48}}</ref> This technique has been criticized for a higher than expected rate of bleeding presumably due to the low temperature which may be insufficient to seal the divided [[blood vessel]]s but several papers offer conflicting (some positive, some negative) results. Long term studies seem to show that surgeons experienced with the technique have very few complications.
*'''[[Harmonic scalpel]]''': This [[medical device]] uses [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] energy to [[Vibration|vibrate]] its blade at 55[[kHz]]. Invisible to the naked [[Human eye|eye]], the vibration transfers energy to the tissue, providing simultaneous cutting and [[coagulation]]. The temperature of the surrounding tissue reaches 80°C. Proponents of this procedure assert that the end result is precise cutting with minimal thermal damage.
*'''Radiofrequency ablation''': Monopolar [[radiofrequency]] thermal ablation transfers radiofrequency energy to the tonsil tissue through probes inserted in the tonsil.  The procedure can be performed in an office (outpatient) setting under light sedation or [[local anesthesia]]. After the treatment is performed, [[scarring]] occurs within the tonsil causing it to decrease in size over a period of several weeks. The treatment can be performed several times. The advantages of this technique are minimal discomfort, ease of operations, and immediate return to work or school. Tonsillar tissue remains after the procedure but is less prominent. This procedure is recommended for treating enlarged tonsils and not chronic or recurrent [[tonsillitis]].
*'''Thermal Welding''': A new technology which uses pure [[thermal energy]] to seal and divide the tissue. The absence of thermal spread means that the temperature of surrounding tissue is only 2-3 °C higher than normal body temperature. Clinical papers show patients with minimal post-operative pain (no requirement for narcotic pain-killers), zero edema (swelling) plus almost no incidence of bleeding. Hospitals in the US are advertising this procedure as "Painless Tonsillectomy". Also known as Tissue Welding.
*'''Carbon dioxide laser''': [[Laser]] tonsil ablation (LTA) finds the otolaryngologist employing a hand-held [[CO2]] or KTP laser to vaporize and remove tonsil tissue. This technique reduces tonsil volume and eliminates recesses in the tonsils that collect chronic and recurrent [[infections]]. This procedure is recommended for chronic recurrent tonsillitis, chronic sore throats, severe [[halitosis]], or airway obstruction caused by enlarged tonsils. The LTA is performed in 15 to 20 [[minute]]s in an office setting under local anesthesia.<ref>[http://lasertonsillectomy.org/typical-laser-treatment/ Typical Laser Treatment]</ref> The patient leaves the office with minimal discomfort and returns to [[school]] or work the next day. Post-tonsillectomy bleeding may occur in 2-5% of patients. Previous research studies state that laser technology provides significantly less pain during the post-operative recovery of [[child]]ren, resulting in less [[sleep]] disturbance, decreased morbidity, and less need for [[medication]]s. On the other hand, some believe that children are averse to outpatient procedures without sedation.

*'''Microdebrider''': The microdebrider is a powered rotary shaving device with continuous suction often used during [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] surgery. It is made up of a cannula or tube, connected to a hand piece, which in turn is connected to a motor with foot control and a suction device. The endoscopic microdebrider is used in performing a partial tonsillectomy, by partially shaving the tonsils. This procedure entails eliminating the obstructive portion of the tonsil while preserving the tonsillar capsule. A natural biologic dressing is left in place over the [[pharyngeal muscles]], preventing injury, inflammation, and infection. The procedure results in less post-operative pain, a more rapid recovery, and perhaps fewer delayed complications. However, the partial tonsillectomy is suggested for enlarged tonsils – not those that incur repeated infections.

==History==
Tonsillectomy has been practiced for 3,000 years, with varying popularity over the centuries.<ref name=McNeill1960>{{cite journal |last=McNeill RA. |date=1 June 1960 |first1=RA|title=A History of Tonsillectomy: Two Millenia of Trauma, Hæmorrhage and Controversy |journal=Ulser Medical Journal|volume=29 |pmid=20476427 |issue=1 |pmc=2384338 |pages=59–63 |id= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> The procedure is claimed in some books as "Hindu medicine" about 1000 BC (non-evidence based literature). Others refer to it as cleaning of tonsil using the nail of the index finger. Roughly a millennium later the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] aristocrat [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] (25 AD &ndash; 50 AD) described a procedure whereby using the finger (or a blunt hook if necessary), the tonsil was separated from the neighboring tissue before being cut out.<ref name=McNeill1960/> [[Galen]] (121 &ndash; 200 AD) was the first to advocate the use of the surgical instrument known as the [[snare device|snare]], a practice that was to become common until [[Aëtius Amidenus|Aetius]] (490 AD) recommended partial removal of the tonsil, writing "Those who extirpate the entire tonsil remove, at the same time, structures that are perfectly healthy, and, in this way, give rise to serious Hæmorrhage".<ref name=McNeill1960/> In the 7th century [[Paulus Aegineta]] (625&ndash;690) described a detailed procedure for tonsillectomy, including dealing with the inevitable post-operative bleeding. 1,200 years pass before the procedure is described again with such precision and detail.<ref name=McNeill1960/>

The [[Middle Ages]] saw tonsillectomy fall into disfavor; [[Ambroise Pare]] (1509) wrote it to be "a bad operation" and suggested a procedure that involved gradual strangulation with a [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]]. This method was not popular with the patients due to the immense pain it caused and the infection that usually followed. Scottish physician [[Peter Lowe (surgeon)|Peter Lowe]] in 1600 summarized the three methods in use at the time, including the ''snare'', the ''ligature'', and the ''excision''.<ref name=McNeill1960/> At the time, the function of the tonsils was thought to be to absorb secretions from the nose; it was assumed that removal of large amounts of tonsillar tissue would interfere with the ability to remove these secretions, causing them to accumulate in the [[larynx]], resulting in hoarseness. For this reason, physicians like [[Dionis]] (1672) and [[Lorenz Heister]] censured the procedure.

[[File:BLW Tonsil Guillotine.jpg|thumb|Tonsil guillotine.]]
In 1828, physician [[Philip Syng Physick]] modified an existing instrument originally designed by [[Benjamin Bell]] for removing the [[uvula]]; the instrument, known as the tonsil guillotine (and later as a [[tonsillotome]]), became the standard instrument for tonsil removal for over 80 years.<ref name=McNeill1960/> By 1897, it became more common to perform complete rather than partial removal of the tonsil after American physician Ballenger noted that partial removal failed to completely alleviate symptoms in a majority of cases. His results using a technique involving removal of the tonsil with a scalpel and forceps were much better than partial removal; tonsillectomy using the guillotine eventually fell out of favor in America.<ref name=McNeill1960/>

==Tonsillectomy and weight gain in children==
A recent study states that tonsillectomies in young children (0 to 7 years) are correlated with weight gain in the years following surgery.<ref>{{cite pmid|19336367}}</ref> However, no causal effect has been established.<ref>{{cite pmid|21515804}}</ref>
