He is of [[German American|German descent]].<ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/thomas-starzl</ref> Originally intending to become a [[priest]] in his teenage years, Starzl's plans changed drastically when his mother died from [[breast cancer]]. He attended [[Westminster College, Missouri|Westminster College]] in [[Fulton, Missouri]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[biology]]. Starzl attended [[Feinberg School of Medicine|Northwestern University Medical School]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], where in 1950 he received a [[Master's degree|Master of Science]] degree in [[anatomy]] and in 1952 earned both a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[neurophysiology]] and an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] with distinction.<ref>{{cite book | author=Starzl, Thomas | title=The Puzzle People: Memoirs of a Transplant Surgeon | location=Pittsburgh | publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh Press]] | year=1992 | isbn=0-8229-3714-X}}</ref> 

Starzl was a surgeon and researcher in the then nascent field of organ transplantation at the [[University of Colorado Health Sciences Center|University of Colorado]] from 1962 until his move to the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1981, where he has remained since. He made an exceptional mark on the medical community creating new surgical techniques. He reportedly worked up to three days straight on organ transplantation procedures as he was the only one who could perform them.

Starzl has authored or co-authored more than 2,130 scientific articles, four books, and 292 chapters. According to the [[Institute for Scientific Information]], Starzl once averaged one paper every 7.3 days, making him one of the most prolific scientists in the world. In 1999, ISI identified Starzl as the most cited scientist in the field of [[clinical medicine]], a measure of his work's lasting influence and utility.

His autobiographical memoir, ''The Puzzle People'', was named by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as the third best book on doctors' lives.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704535004575348833407184048.html | first=Abraham| last=Verghese | date=2010-07-10 | title=Five Best | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref>

Starzl's most notable accomplishments include:
*Performing the first human [[liver transplant]]  in 1963, and the first successful human liver transplant in 1967, both at the [[University of Colorado Health Sciences Center]].<ref>[http://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/fs_new/mstonesorgtrans.cfm Milestones in Organ Transplantation] National Kidney Foundation</ref>
*Establishing the clinical utility of [[ciclosporin]] (cyclosporine) in 1982, and [[tacrolimus]] in 1991, both leading to [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval;
*Development of multiple technical advances in [[organ preservation]], [[organ procurement|procurement]] and [[Organ transplant|transplant]];
*Delineating the indications and limitations of abdominal organ transplantation;
*Defining the underlying basis for organ transplantation as a treatment of inherited [[metabolic disease]]s (thus providing the rationale for current-day [[gene therapy]] efforts);
*Recognizing the causative role of [[immunosuppression]] in the development of post-transplant [[lymphoproliferative disease]] and other opportunistic infections and the utility of reversing the immunosuppressed state as the principal treatment;
*Performing the first simultaneous heart and liver transplant on six-year-old [[Stormie Jones]] in 1984;<ref name="nytimes">New York Times. February 20, 1990.

In 2006, at a celebration for his 80th birthday, the [[University of Pittsburgh]] renamed one of its newest medical research buildings the Thomas E. Starzl Biomedical Science Tower in recognition of his achievements and contributions to the field.<ref>{{cite news|last=Srikameswaran|first=Anita|title=Pitt names tower after transplant pioneer|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06070/668774.stm|accessdate=7 August 2011|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=March 11, 2006}}</ref>   On October 15, 2007, the Western Pennsylvania American Liver Foundation and the City of Pittsburgh honored Starzl by dedicating Lothrop Street, near his office and the biomedical research tower bearing his name, as "Thomas E. Starzl Way".<ref>[http://pittnews.com/newsstory/lothrop-street-dedicated-to-dr-starzl/ Enconomides, Nadia; Lothrop Street dedicated to Dr. Starzl; The Pitt News; 2007-10-16; accessdate=2008-08-21]</ref>

==Retirement==
Retired from clinical and surgical service since 1991, Dr. Starzl now devotes his time to research endeavors and remains active as professor of surgery at the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center|University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s (UPMC)]] program named in his honor: the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute. Since his “retirement,” he has earned the additional distinctions of being one of the most prolific scientists in the world as well as the most cited scientist in the field of clinical medicine.<ref>[http://www.upmc.edu University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]</ref>

==Personal life==
Dr. Starzl has been married two times.  He has three children: Timothy Wakefield, Thomas Fitzgerald, and Rebecca Ann (deceased 2008) by his first wife of 20 years, Barbara June (née Brothers) deceased, and none by his second wife of 30 years, Joy Denise (née Conger).

==Miscellany==
On the television medical drama ''[[Three Rivers (TV series)|Three Rivers]]'', the resume of the fictional transplant pioneer is based on Starzl's accomplishments.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09277/1002402-67.stm | title= Doctored Pittsburgh-set medical drama finally premieres | first=Rob | last=Owen | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2009-10-04 | accessdate=2009-10-28}}</ref> In addition, an episode of the television series ''[[The 4400]]'' was entitled [[The Starzl Mutation]]. The name Starzl was used to refer to the manufacturer of an X-ray machine, a fault in which caused the titular mutation. Whether this is a deliberate reference to Thomas Starzl is unknown.
