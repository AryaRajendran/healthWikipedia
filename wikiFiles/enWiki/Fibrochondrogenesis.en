== Characteristics ==
Fibrochondrogenesis is a [[congenital disorder]] presenting several features and [[radiology|radiological]] findings, some which distinguish it from other osteochondrodysplasias.<ref name=fcg98>{{cite journal |pmid=9475607 |year=1998 |month=Jan |author=Hunt NC, Vujanić GM |title=Fibrochondrogenesis in a 17-week fetus: a case expanding the phenotype |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=326–329 |issn=0148-7299 |journal=American journal of medical genetics |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19980123)75:3<326::AID-AJMG20>3.0.CO;2-Q}}</ref> These include: fibroblastic dysplasia and [[fibrosis]] of [[chondrocyte]]s (cells which form cartilage);<ref name=autor84/><ref name=fcg78/> and flared, widened 
[[long bone]] [[metaphysis|metaphyses]] (the portion of bone that grows during childhood).<ref name=fcg84/><ref name=preult98>{{cite journal |pmid=9759906 |year=1998 |month=Jul |author=Mégarbané A, Haddad S, Berjaoui L |title=Prenatal ultrasonography: clinical and radiological findings in a boy with fibrochondrogenesis |volume=15 |issue=7 |pages=403–407 |issn=0735-1631 |journal=American journal of perinatology |doi=10.1055/s-2007-993966}}</ref> 

Other prominent features include dwarfism,<ref name=fcg05/> shortened [[rib]]s that have a [[wikt:concave|concave]] appearance,<ref name=fcg84/> [[micrognathism]] (severely underdeveloped [[jaw]]),<ref name=fcg98/> [[macrocephaly]] (enlarged head),<ref name=preult98/> [[chest|thoracic]] [[hypoplasia]] (underdeveloped chest),<ref name=preult98/> enlarged [[stomach]],<ref name=preult98/> [[platyspondyly]] (flattened [[vertebral column|spine]]),<ref name=fcg84/> and the somewhat uncommon deformity of [[wikt:bifurcation|bifid]] [[tongue]] (in which the tongue appears split, resembling that of a [[reptile]]).<ref name=fcg98/>

== Cause ==
The cause of platyspondyly in fibrochondrogenesis can be attributed in part to odd malformations and structural flaws found in the [[body of vertebra|vertebral bodies]] of the spinal column in affected infants.<ref name=autor84/><ref name=fcg84/>

Fibrochondrogenesis alters the normal function of chondrocytes, fibroblasts, metaphyseal cells and others associated with cartilage, bone and [[connective tissue]]s.<ref name=fcg04/><ref name=fcg02/><ref name=autor84/> Overwhelming
disorganization of cellular processes involved in the formation of cartilage and bone ([[ossification]]), in combination with fibroblastic degeneration of these cells, developmental errors and systemic skeletal malformations describes the severity of this lethal osteochondrodysplasia.<ref name=fcg02/><ref name=autor84/><ref name=fcg84/><ref name=preult98/>

== Genetics ==
[[Image:Autorecessive.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Fibrochondrogenesis has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]
Fibrochondrogenesis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.<ref name=autor84/> This means that the defective [[gene]] responsible for the disorder is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the gene &mdash; one copy inherited from each parent &mdash; are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder each [[genetic carrier|carry]] one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Currently, no specific genetic [[mutation]] has been established as the cause of fibrochondrogenesis.<ref name=omim>{{OMIM|282520}}</ref> 

[[Omphalocele]] is a congenital feature where the [[abdominal wall]] has an opening, partially exposing the [[Viscus#Abdomen|abdominal viscera]] (typically, the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] of the [[gastrointestinal tract]]). Fibrochondrogenesis is believed to be related to omphalocele
type III, suggesting a possible genetic association between the two disorders.<ref name=omph>{{cite journal |author=Chen CP |title=Syndromes and disorders associated with omphalocele (III): single gene disorders, neural tube defects, diaphragmatic defects and others |journal=Taiwan J Obstet Gynecol. |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=111–120 |month=Jan |year=2007 |pmid=17638618 |doi=10.1016/S1028-4559(07)60004-7 }}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
Fibrochondrogenesis is quite rare.<ref name=fcg05/> A 1996 study from [[Spain]] determined a national minimal prevalence for the disorder at 8 cases out of 1,158,067 live births.<ref name=fcgesp>{{cite journal |pmid=8733059 |year=1996 |month=May |author=Martínez-Frías ML, García A, Cuevas J, Rodríguez JI, Urioste M |title=A new case of fibrochondrogenesis from Spain |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=429–431 |issn=0022-2593 |pmc=1050618 |journal=J Med Genet. |doi=10.1136/jmg.33.5.429}}</ref>

A [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) [[United Arab Emirates University|University]] report, from early 2003, evaluated the results of a 5-year study on the occurrence of a broad range of osteochondrodysplasias.<ref name=fcguae>{{cite journal |pmid=12769508 |year=2003 |month=Feb |author=Al-Gazali LI, Bakir M, Hamid Z, Varady E, Varghes M, Haas D, Bener A, Padmanabhan R, Abdulrrazzaq YM, Dawadu A |title=Birth prevalence and pattern of osteochondrodysplasias in an inbred high risk population |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=125–132 |issn=1542-0752 |doi=10.1002/bdra.10009 |journal=Birth defects research. Part A, Clinical and molecular teratology}}</ref> Out of 38,048 newborns in [[Al Ain]], over the course of the study period, fibrochondrogenesis was found to be the most common of the recessive forms of osteochondrodysplasia, with a prevalence ratio of 1.05:10,000 births.<ref name=fcguae/>

While these results represented the most common occurrence within the group studied, they do not dispute the rarity of fibrochondrogenesis. The study also included the high rate of [[consanguinity|consanguinous marriages]] as a prevailing factor for these disorders, as well as the extremely low rate of diagnosis-related [[abortion|pregnancy terminations]] throughout the region.<ref name=fcguae/>

== Alternate research ==
The fibrocartilaginous effects of fibrochondrogenesis on chondrocytes has shown potential as a means to produce [[therapy|therapeutic]] cellular [[biomaterial]]s via [[tissue engineering]] and manipulation of [[stem cell]]s,<ref name=hescfcg>{{cite journal |pmid=18454697 |year=2008 |month=May |author=Hoben GM, Willard VP, Athanasiou KA |title=Fibrochondrogenesis of hESCs: Growth Factor Combinations and Cocultures |volume=Epub |issue= 2|pages= 283–92|issn=1547-3287 |doi=10.1089/scd.2008.0024 |journal=Stem cells and development |pmc=3132948}}</ref><ref name=scftwo>{{cite journal |pmid=18032702 |year=2008 |month=Feb |author=Hoben GM, Koay EJ, Athanasiou KA |title=Fibrochondrogenesis in two embryonic stem cell lines: effects of differentiation timelines |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=422–430 |issn=1066-5099 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.2007-0641 |journal=Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)}}</ref> specifically [[human]] [[embryo]]nic [[embryonic stem cell|stem cells]].<ref name=hescfcg/>

Utilization of these cells as curative cartilage replacement materials on the cellular level has shown promise, with beneficial applications including the repair and healing of damaged [[knee]] [[meniscus (anatomy)|menisci]] and [[synovial joint]]s; [[temporomandibular joint]]s, and [[vertebra]].<ref name=hescfcg/><ref name=scftwo/><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15009938 |year=2004 |month=Jan |author=Fox DB, Cook JL, Arnoczky SP, Tomlinson JL, Kuroki K, Kreeger JM, Malaviya P |title=Fibrochondrogenesis of free intraarticular small intestinal submucosa scaffolds |volume=10 |issue=1&ndash;2 |pages=129–37 |issn=1076-3279 |doi=10.1089/107632704322791772 |journal=Tissue engineering}}</ref>
