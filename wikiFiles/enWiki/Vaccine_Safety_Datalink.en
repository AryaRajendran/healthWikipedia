The '''Vaccine Safety Datalink Project''' (VSD) was established in 1990 by the [[United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to study the [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse side effects]] of vaccines.

Four large [[health maintenance organization]]s, including [[Kaiser Permanente]], were initially recruited to provide the CDC with medical data on [[vaccination]] histories, health outcomes, and subject characteristics.  The VSD database contains data compiled from [[surveillance]] on more than seven million [[United States|Americans]], including about 500,000 children from birth through age six years (2% of the U.S. population in this age group).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chen RT |title=Vaccine Safety Datalink project: a new tool for improving vaccine safety monitoring in the United States.

The VSD data-sharing program is now being administered by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] Research Data Center.  The data sharing guidelines have been revised to include comments from interested groups as well as recommendations from the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM).

Data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink Project have been utilized to address a number of vaccine safety concerns; examples include a study clarifying the risk of [[anaphylaxis]] after vaccine administration<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bohlke K |title=Risk of anaphylaxis after vaccination of children and adolescents |journal=Pediatrics |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=815–20 |year=2003 |pmid=14523172 |doi=10.1542/peds.112.4.815 |author-separator=, |author2=Davis RL |author3=Marcy SM |display-authors=3 |last4=Braun |first4=M.
