'''Metoidioplasty''' or '''metaoidioplasty''' (informally called a '''meto''' or '''meta''') is a [[Sex reassignment surgery (female-to-male)|female-to-male sex reassignment surgery]].<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118853935/abstract Metoidioplasty: a variant of phalloplasty in female transsexuals] by S.V.

(Archives of Sexual Behavior, Volume 15, Number 2, April 1986)</ref> (as the clitoris and the [[penis]] are developmentally [[Homology (biology)|homologous]]). In a metoidioplasty, a surgeon separates the enlarged [[clitoris]] from the [[labia minora]], and severs its [[Suspensory ligament of clitoris|suspensory ligament]] in order to lower it to approximate the position of the penis.

==Comparison with phalloplasty==
Metoidioplasty is technically simpler than [[phalloplasty]], costs less, and has fewer potential complications. However, phalloplasty patients are far more likely to be capable of [[sexual penetration]] after they recover from surgery.

In a phalloplasty, the surgeon fabricates a neopenis by grafting tissue from a donor site (such as from the patient's arm or leg). A phalloplasty takes about 8&ndash;10 hours to complete, and may be followed by a second surgery to implant an erectile [[prosthesis]].

Metoidioplasty typically requires 2&ndash;3 hours to complete. Because the clitoris' [[erectile tissue]] functions normally, a prosthesis is unnecessary for erection (although the clitoris might not become as rigid as a [[penile erection]]). In nearly all cases, metoidioplasty patients can continue to have [[clitoral orgasm]]s after surgery.

==Operation==
# After patient prep, the skin surrounding the enlarged clitoris is incised on the underside and the lateral crura, which suspend the tissue in place, are cut, freeing the clitoral tissue from the pubic bone.
# If the urethra is to be extended, the process starts now using mucosal tissues from either the vaginal area or from inside the mouth/cheeks. An experimental option is a graft from the intestines. The labia minora can be used to protect the graft, as well as provide greater girth. A catheter is placed in the extension to facilitate healing for two to three weeks.
# The neopenis is then provided with skin by cutting the labia minora and wrapping around the tissue and secured with stitches. [[Scrotoplasty]] is usually done at the same time as metoidioplasty surgery. [[Vaginectomy]], [[hysterectomy]] and/or [[oophorectomy]] can also be performed at this time if they have not been done already.

===Alternative techniques===
If a metoidioplasty is performed without extending the urethra and/or a scrotoplasty, this is sometimes called a '''clitoral release'''. This is less expensive than a complete metoidioplasty but does not allow for urination through the neopenis while standing. However this also offers surgery with less risk because the urinary system remains unaltered without a urethral extension, and still affords some of the visual effects of a complete metoidioplasty along with the ability to use the neopenis for sexual penetration. [[Vaginectomy]] is an option with this surgery.

===Complications===
In a study of post-operative [[trans men]], 28% of patients who had the urethra extended had temporary swelling resulting in dribbling and spraying of urine, no medical intervention was needed. There was only a small chance of urethral strictures (narrowing of the urethra) and less than 10% had instance of a fistula (hole in the urethra) requiring minor revision. The average neophallic length after was 5.7&nbsp;cm (with a range 4â€“10&nbsp;cm). All patients reported ability to achieve an erection and normal sensation. In patients who had scrotoplasty, there were no reports of rejection or complications related to the testicular prostheses.
