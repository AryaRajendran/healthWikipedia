'''Cholera''' is an infection in the small intestine caused by the bacterium ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. The main symptoms are watery [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]]. Transmission occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the [[feces]] (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms. The severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid [[dehydration]] and [[electrolyte]] imbalance, and death in some cases.  The primary treatment is [[oral rehydration therapy]], typically with [[oral rehydration solution]], to replace water and electrolytes. If this is not tolerated or does not provide improvement fast enough, [[intravenous]] fluids can also be used. [[Antibacterial]] drugs are beneficial in those with severe disease to shorten its duration and severity.  Worldwide, it affects 3–5 million people and causes 100,000–130,000 deaths a year {{As of|2010|lc=on}}. Cholera was one of the earliest infections to be studied by [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] methods.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Image:PHIL 1939 lores.jpg|thumb|225px|A person with severe dehydration due to cholera - note the sunken eyes and decreased skin turgor which produces wrinkled hands and skin]]

The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse, painless [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]] of clear fluid.<ref name=Lancet2004/> These symptoms usually start suddenly, one to five days after ingestion of the bacteria.<ref name=Lancet2004/> The diarrhea is frequently described as "rice water" in nature and may have a fishy odor.<ref name=Lancet2004/> An untreated person with cholera may produce {{convert|10|to|20|litre|USgal|sigfig=1}} of diarrhea a day<ref name=Lancet2004/> with fatal results. For every symptomatic person, 3 to 100 people get the infection but remain asymptomatic.<ref>{{cite journal |author=King AA, Ionides EL, J.Luckhurst, Bouma MJ |title=Inapparent infections and cholera dynamics |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7206 |pages=877–80 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18704085 |doi=10.1038/nature07084 |url=}}</ref>  Cholera has been nicknamed the "blue death" due to a patient's skin turning a bluish-gray hue from extreme loss of fluids.<ref>McElroy, Ann and Patricia K.

[[Image:Cholera feces.jpg|thumb|Typical "rice water" diarrhea]]
If the severe diarrhea is not treated with intravenous rehydration, it can result in life-threatening [[dehydration]] and electrolyte imbalances.<ref name=Lancet2004/> The typical symptoms of dehydration include low [[blood pressure]], poor skin turgor (wrinkled hands), sunken eyes, and a rapid pulse.<ref name=Lancet2004/>

== Cause ==
{{Main|Vibrio cholerae}}
[[Image:Vibrio cholerae.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', the bacterium that causes cholera]]

Transmission is primarily by the fecal contamination of food and water caused by poor [[sanitation]].<ref name=WHO2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/immunization/Cholera_PP_Accomp_letter__Mar_10_2010.pdf |title=Cholera vaccines.

=== Susceptibility ===
About 100 million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult.<ref name=Lancet2004/> This dose, however, is less in those with lowered [[gastric acid]]ity (for instance those using [[proton pump inhibitors]]).<ref name=Lancet2004/> Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having the highest rates of infection.<ref name=Lancet2004/> Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their [[blood type]], with those with [[type O blood]] being the most susceptible.<ref name=Lancet2004/><ref name="Harris_2005">{{cite journal|author=Harris JB, Khan AI, LaRocque RC, ''et al.'' |title=Blood Group, Immunity, and Risk of Infection with Vibrio cholerae in an Area of Endemicity |journal=Infect.

The [[cystic fibrosis]] genetic [[mutation]] in humans has been said to maintain a selective advantage: [[heterozygous]] carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by cystic fibrosis) are more resistant to ''V. cholerae'' infections.<ref name="Bertranpetit_1996">{{cite journal |author=Bertranpetit J, Calafell F |title=Genetic and geographical variability in cystic fibrosis: evolutionary considerations |journal=Ciba Found.

=== Transmission ===
Cholera is typically transmitted by either contaminated food or water. In the developed world, seafood is the usual cause, while in the developing world it is more often water.<ref name=Lancet2004/> Cholera has been found in only two other animal populations: [[shellfish]] and [[plankton]].<ref name=Lancet2004 />

People infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as "rice-water", contaminates water used by others, disease transmission may occur.<ref name="Sherris">{{cite book| author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors)| title = Sherris Medical Microbiology| edition = 4th| pages = 376–7| publisher = McGraw Hill| year = 2004| isbn = 0-8385-8529-9}}</ref> The source of the contamination is typically other cholera sufferers when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways, [[groundwater]] or drinking water supplies. Drinking any infected water and eating any foods washed in the water, as well as [[shellfish]] living in the affected [[waterway]], can cause a person to contract an infection. Cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person.  Both toxic and nontoxic strains exist. Nontoxic strains can acquire toxicity through a [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] [[bacteriophage]].<ref name="Archivist_1997">{{cite journal| author=Archivist| title=Cholera phage discovery| journal=Arch Dis Child| year=1997| volume=76| page=274| url=http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/76/3/274| doi=10.1136/adc.76.3.274| ref=harv| issue=3}}</ref> Coastal cholera outbreaks typically follow [[algal bloom|zooplankton blooms]], thus making cholera a [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] disease.

== Mechanism ==

[[Image:Cholera.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Drawing]] of [[Death (personification)|Death]] bringing cholera, in ''[[Le Petit Journal]]'' (1912)]]

When consumed, most bacteria do not survive the acidic conditions of the [[stomach|human stomach]].<ref name="Hartwell">{{cite book| author=Hartwell LH, Hood L, Goldberg ML, Reynolds AE, Silver LM, and Veres RC| year=2004| title=Genetics: From genes to genomes| publisher=Mc-Graw Hill| location=Boston| pages=551–552, 572–574}} (using the turning off and turning on of [[gene expression]] to make toxin proteins in cholera bacteria as a "comprehensive example" of what is known about the mechanisms by which bacteria change the mix of proteins they express to respond to the changing opportunities for surviving and thriving in different chemical environments).</ref> The few surviving bacteria conserve their [[nutrient|energy and stored nutrients]] during the passage through the stomach by shutting down much protein production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the [[small intestine]], they need to propel themselves through the thick [[mucous membrane|mucus]] that lines the small intestine to get to the intestinal walls where they can thrive. ''V. cholerae'' bacteria start up production of the hollow cylindrical protein [[flagellin]] to make [[flagella]], the cork-screw helical fibers they rotate to propel themselves through the mucus of the small intestine.

Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall they no longer need the flagella to move. The bacteria stop producing the protein flagellin to conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins which they express in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, ''V. cholerae'' start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of ''V. cholerae'' bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.

The [[cholera toxin]] (CTX or CT) is an [[oligomer]]ic complex made up of six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a [[disulfide bond]].  The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to [[GM1]] [[ganglioside]]s on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells.  The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that [[ADP-ribosylation|ADP-ribosylates]] [[G protein]]s, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring.  Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]].  Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the  A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called [[ADP-ribosylation factor 6]] (Arf6).<ref name=O>{{cite journal |author=O'Neal C, Jobling M, Holmes R, Hol W |title=Structural basis for the activation of cholera toxin by human ARF6-GTP |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5737 |pages=1093–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16099990 |doi=10.1126/science.1113398 |ref=harv}}</ref>  Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the [[Gs alpha subunit]] of the [[heterotrimeric G protein]].  This results in constitutive [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] production, which in turn leads to secretion of H<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin is introduced into ''V. cholerae'' by horizontal gene transfer.  Virulent strains of ''V. cholerae'' carry a variant of [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] [[bacteriophage]] called CTXf or CTXφ.

Microbiologists have studied the [[gene expression|genetic mechanisms]] by which the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall.<ref name="DiRita">{{cite journal |author=DiRita VJ, Parsot C, Jander G, Mekalanos JJ |title=Regulatory cascade controls virulence in Vibrio cholerae |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=88 |issue=12 |pages=5403–7 |year=1991 |month=June |pmid=2052618 |pmc=51881 |doi=10.1073/pnas.88.12.5403 |url= |ref=harv}}</ref> Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump [[chloride]] ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six litres of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated if an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is not taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.

By inserting separate, successive sections of ''V. cholerae'' DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which ''V. cholerae'' responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of ''V. cholerae'' [[virulence]] determinants. In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of [[virulence]] genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine.<ref name="DiRita"/> Current research aims at discovering "the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine."<ref name="DiRita" />

=== Genetic structure ===
Amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of the pandemic isolates of ''V. cholerae'' has revealed variation in the genetic structure. Two clusters have been identified: Cluster I and Cluster II. For the most part, Cluster I consists of strains from the 1960s and 1970s, while Cluster II largely contains strains from the 1980s and 1990s, based on the change in the clone structure. This grouping of strains is best seen in the strains from the African continent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lan R, Reeves PR |year=2002 |month= Jan|title=Pandemic Spread of Cholera: Genetic Diversity and Relationships within the Seventh Pandemic Clone of Vibrio cholerae Determined by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism |journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=172–181 |doi=10.1128/JCM.40.1.172-181.2002 |pmid=11773113 |issn=0095-1137 |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11773113 |pmc=120103 |ref=harv }}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
A rapid dip-stick test is available to determine the presence of ''V. cholerae''.<ref name=NEJM2006/> In those samples that test positive, further testing should be done to determine antibiotic resistance.<ref name=NEJM2006/> In [[epidemic]] situations, a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a patient history and doing a brief examination. Treatment is usually started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis.

Stool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is ''V. cholerae'' O1. If ''V. cholerae'' [[serotype|serogroup]] O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for ''V. cholerae'' O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.
Infection with ''V. cholerae'' O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by ''V. cholerae'' O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the United States.<ref name="CDC_Diag">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/top.pdf |title=Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera |publisher=CDC | location=Atlanta, GA | format=PDF |year=1999 |accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref>

A number of special media have been employed for the cultivation for cholera vibrios. They are classified as follows:

=== Enrichment media ===
# Alkaline peptone water at pH 8.6
# Monsur's taurocholate tellurite peptone water at pH 9.2

=== Plating media ===
# Alkaline bile salt agar (BSA): The colonies are very similar to those on [[agar|nutrient agar]].
# Monsur's gelatin Tauro cholate trypticase tellurite agar (GTTA) medium: Cholera vibrios produce small, translucent colonies with a greyish-black center.
# TCBS medium: This is the mostly widely used medium; it contains thiosulphate, citrate, bile salts and sucrose. Cholera vibrios produce flat, 2–3-mm-diameter, yellow-nucleated colonies.

Direct [[microscopy]] of stool is not recommended, as it is unreliable. Microscopy is preferred only after enrichment, as this process reveals the characteristic motility of ''Vibrio'' and its inhibition by appropriate [[antiserum|antisera]]. Diagnosis can be confirmed, as well as serotyping done by [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] with specific sera.

== Prevention ==
[[Image:Cholera hospital in Dhaka.jpg|thumb|[[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh|Cholera hospital]] in [[Dhaka]], showing typical "cholera beds"]]
Although cholera may be life-threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper sanitation practices are followed. In [[developed countries]], due to nearly universal advanced [[water treatment]] and sanitation practices, cholera is no longer a major health threat. The last major outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred in 1910–1911.<ref name="moltke1">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Cholera Kills Boy.

There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted:

* Sterilization: Proper disposal and treatment of infected fecal waste water produced by cholera victims and all contaminated materials (e.g. clothing, bedding, etc.) are essential. All materials that come in contact with cholera patients should be [[Disinfection|sanitized]] by washing in hot water, using [[chlorine]] [[bleach]] if possible. Hands that touch cholera patients or their clothing, bedding, etc., should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with chlorinated water or other effective antimicrobial agents.
* Sewage: antibacterial treatment of general [[sewage]] by chlorine, ozone, ultraviolet light or other effective treatment before it enters the waterways or underground water supplies helps prevent undiagnosed patients from inadvertently spreading the disease.
* Sources: Warnings about possible cholera contamination should be posted around contaminated water sources with directions on how to [[decontamination|decontaminate]] the water (boiling, chlorination etc.) for possible use.
* Water purification: All water used for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], ozone water treatment, ultraviolet light sterilization (e.g. by [[solar water disinfection]]), or antimicrobial filtration in any area where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. [[Cloth filter]]s or [[#Sari filtration|sari filtration]], though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in [[Bangladesh]] that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.

=== Surveillance ===
Surveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during rainy seasons. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provide guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/control/en/index.html |title=Cholera: prevention and control |publisher=WHO |work=Health topics | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref> For prevention to be effective, it is important that cases are reported to national health authorities.<ref name=Lancet2004/>

=== Vaccine ===
{{Main|Cholera vaccine}}

A number of safe and effective oral vaccines for cholera are available.<ref name="pmid21412922">{{cite journal |author=Sinclair D, Abba K, Zaman K, Qadri F, Graves PM |title=Oral vaccines for preventing cholera |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=3 |pages=CD008603 |year=2011 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008603.pub2 |pmid=21412922}}</ref> [[Dukoral]], an orally administered, inactivated whole cell vaccine, has an overall efficacy of about 52% during the first year after being given and 62% in the second year, with minimal side effects.<ref name="pmid21412922"/> It is available in over 60 countries.

=== Sari filtration ===

An effective and relatively cheap method to prevent transmission of ''V. cholera'' is the practice of folding a [[sari]] (a long fabric garment) multiple times to create a simple filter for drinking water.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ali M, Emch M, Yunus M, Sack D, Lopez AL, Holmgren J, Clemens J |title=Vaccine Protection of Bangladeshi infants and young children against cholera: implications for vaccine deployment and person-to-person transmission |journal=Pediatr Infect Dis J |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=33–7 |month=Jan |year=2008 |doi=10.1097/INF.0b013e318149dffd |pmid=18162935}}</ref> Folding saris four to eight times may create a simple filter to reduce the amount of active ''V. cholera'' in the filtered water.<ref>Z.

The education of proper sari filter use is imperative, as there is a positive correlation between sari misuse and the incidence of childhood diarrhea; soiled saris worn by women are vectors of transmission of enteric pathogens to young children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stanton BF, Clemens JD, Clements JD |title=Soiled saris: a vector of disease transmission? |journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg |volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=485–8 |year=1986 |pmid=3798547 |doi=10.1016/0035-9203(86)90353-6}}</ref> Educating at-risk populations about the proper use of the sari filter method may decrease ''V. cholera''-associated disease.

== Treatment ==
[[Image:Cholera rehydration nurses.jpg|thumb|Cholera patient being treated by medical staff in 1992]]
Continued eating speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function.  The World Health Organization recommends this generally for cases of diarrhea no matter what the underlying cause.<ref name=WHOTreatmentOfDiarrhoea2005/>  A CDC training manual specifically for cholera states: “Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment.  Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently.”<ref name=CDCCommunityHealthWorkerTrainingManual>[http://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/pdf/chw_trainingmaterialsforcholera.pdf Community Health Worker Training Materials for Cholera Prevention and Control], CDC, slides at back are dated 11/17/2010.  See esp pages 7-8.</ref>

=== Fluids ===
In most cases, cholera can be successfully treated with [[oral rehydration therapy]] (ORT), which is highly effective, safe, and simple to administer.<ref name=NEJM2006/> Rice-based solutions are preferred to glucose-based ones due to greater efficiency.<ref name=NEJM2006/> In severe cases with significant dehydration, [[intravenous]] rehydration may be necessary. [[Ringer's lactate]] is the preferred solution, often with added potassium.<ref name=Lancet2004/><ref name=WHOTreatmentOfDiarrhoea2005>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf THE TREATMENT OF DIARRHOEA, A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], World Health Organization, 2005.  See page 10 (14 in PDF) and esp chapter “5. MANAGEMENT OF SUSPECTED CHOLERA,” pages 16-17 (20-21 in PDF).</ref> Large volumes and continued replacement until diarrhea has subsided may be needed.<ref name=Lancet2004/> Ten percent of a person's body weight in fluid may need to be given in the first two to four hours.<ref name=Lancet2004/> This method was first tried on a mass scale during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], and was found to have much success.<ref>[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/03/21/the_civil_war_that_killed_cholera The Civil War That Killed Cholera], foreignpolicy.com.</ref>

If commercially produced oral rehydration solutions are too expensive or difficult to obtain, solutions can be made.  One such recipe calls for 1 litre of boiled water, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 6 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium and to improve taste.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm|title=Oral Rehydration Solutions: Made at Home|year=2010|accessdate=2010-10-29|publisher=The Mother and Child Health and Education Trust}}</ref>

=== Electrolytes ===
As there frequently is initially [[acidosis]], the [[potassium]] level may be normal, even though large losses have occurred.<ref name=Lancet2004/> As the dehydration is corrected, potassium levels may decrease rapidly, and thus need to be replaced.<ref name=Lancet2004/>

=== Antibiotics ===

Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human [[feces]] and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread, but bodies of water can serve as a [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]], and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera was not known in the [[Americas]] for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared towards the end of that century.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Blake | first1 = PA | title = Epidemiology of cholera in the Americas | journal = Gastroenterology clinics of North America | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 639–60 | year = 1993 | pmid = 7691740 }}</ref>

== History ==
The word cholera is from {{lang-el|χολέρα}} ''kholera'' from χολή ''kholē'' "bile". Cholera likely has its origins in the [[Indian Subcontinent]]; it has been prevalent in the [[Ganges delta]] since ancient times.<ref name=Lancet2004/> The disease first spread by trade routes (land and sea) to [[Russia]] in 1817, then to the rest of [[Europe]], and from Europe to [[North America]].<ref name=Lancet2004/> Seven cholera [[pandemic]]s have occurred in the past 200 years, with the seventh originating in [[Indonesia]] in 1961.<ref>"[http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/05/09/f-cholera-outbreaks.html Cholera's seven pandemics]". CBC News. October 22, 2010.</ref>

The [[first cholera pandemic]] occurred in the Bengal region of India starting in 1817 through 1824.  The disease dispersed from India to Southeast Asia, China, Japan, the Middle East, and southern Russia.  The [[Second cholera pandemic|second pandemic]] lasted from 1827 to 1835 and affected the United States and Europe.  The [[Third cholera pandemic|third pandemic]] erupted in 1839, persisted until 1856, extended to North Africa, and reached South America, for the first time specifically infringing upon Brazil. Cholera hit the sub-Saharan African region during the [[Fourth cholera pandemic|fourth pandemic]] from 1863 to 1875.  The [[Fifth cholera pandemic|fifth]] and [[Sixth cholera pandemic|sixth pandemics]] raged from 1881–1896 and 1899-1923.  These epidemics were less fatal due to a greater understanding of the cholera bacteria.  Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, Persia, India, and the Philippines were hit hardest during these epidemics, while other areas, like Germany in 1892 and Naples from 1910–1911, experienced severe outbreaks.  The final [[Seventh cholera pandemic|pandemic]] originated in 1961 in Indonesia and is marked by the emergence of a new strain, nicknamed El Tor, which still persists today in developing countries.<ref>Aberth, John. Plagues in world History. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2011, 102.</ref>

In the past, people traveling in ships would hang a yellow [[quarantine]] flag if one or more of the crew members suffered from cholera. Passengers from boats with a yellow flag hung would not be allowed to disembark at any harbor for an extended period, typically 30 to 40 days.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sehdev PS |title=The origin of quarantine |journal=Clin.

Historically many different claimed remedies have existed in folklore. In the 1854–1855 outbreak in Naples homeopathic [[Camphor]] was used according to [[Samuel Hahnemann|Hahnemann]].<ref>http://www.legatum.sk/en:ahr:bayes-cholera-as-treated-by-dr-rubini-158-10355 The American Homoeopathic Review Vol. 06 No. 11-12, 1866, pages 401-403</ref> While T.

=== Cholera morbus ===
The term ''cholera morbus'' was used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to describe both nonepidemic cholera and other gastrointestinal diseases (sometimes epidemic) that resembled cholera. The term is not in current use, but is found in many older references.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.antiquusmorbus.com/English/EnglishC.htm| title= Archaic medical terms| publisher=Antiquus Morbus| year=2007| accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref> The other diseases are now known collectively as [[gastroenteritis]].

=== Research ===
The Russian-born bacteriologist [[Waldemar Haffkine]] developed the first cholera vaccine around 1900. The bacterium had been originally isolated 45 years earlier (1855) by Italian anatomist [[Filippo Pacini]], but its exact nature and his results were not widely known.

One of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] (1813–1858), who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water.<ref name="Rosenberg">{{cite book |author=Rosenberg, Charles E. |title=The cholera years: the United States in 1832, 1849 and 1866 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1987 |pages= |isbn=0-226-72677-0}}</ref> Dr. Snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849.  In his major "state of the art" review of 1855, he proposed a substantially complete and correct model for the [[etiology]] of the disease. In two pioneering epidemiological field studies, he was able to demonstrate human [[sewage]] contamination was the most probable disease vector in two major epidemics in London in 1854.<ref>Dr John Snow, ''The mode of communication of cholera'', London 1855</ref> His model was not immediately accepted, but it was seen to be the more plausible, as medical microbiology developed over the next 30 years or so.

Cities in developed nations made massive investment in clean water supply and well-separated sewage treatment infrastructures between the mid-1850s and the 1900s.  This eliminated the threat of cholera epidemics from the major developed cities in the world. In 1883, [[Robert Koch]] identified ''V. cholerae'' with a microscope as the bacillus causing the disease.<ref>Aberth,John. Plagues in World History. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2011, 101.</ref>

[[Robert Allan Phillips]], working at the US [[Naval Medical Research Unit Two]] in Southeast Asia, evaluated the pathophysiology of the disease using modern laboratory chemistry techniques and developed a protocol for rehydration. His research lead the [[Lasker Foundation]] to award him its prize in 1967.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
 
Cholera has been a laboratory for the study of evolution of virulence. The province of Bengal in [[British Raj|British India]] was partitioned into [[West Bengal]] and [[East Pakistan]] in 1947. Prior to partition, both regions had cholera pathogens with similar characteristics. After 1947, India made more progress on public health than East Pakistan (now [[Bangladesh]]). As a consequence,{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} the strains of the pathogen that succeeded in India had a greater incentive in the longevity of the host.  They have become less virulent than the strains prevailing in Bangladesh.  These draw upon the resources of the host population and rapidly kill many victims.

More recently, in 2002, Alam, ''et al.'', studied stool samples from patients at the [[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh|International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease]] in [[Dhaka, Bangladesh]]. From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of ''V. cholerae'' through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state.  Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where [[gene]]s that control biosynthesis of [[amino acid]]s, [[iron]] uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation. These induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the "rice water" stools, an environment of limited oxygen and iron, of patients with a cholera infection.<ref name="Merrell2002">{{cite journal |author=Merrell DS, Butler SM, Qadri F, ''et al.'' |title=Host-induced epidemic spread of the cholera bacterium |journal=Nature |volume=417 |issue=6889 |pages=642–5 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12050664 |pmc=2776822 |doi=10.1038/nature00778 |ref=harv}}</ref>
