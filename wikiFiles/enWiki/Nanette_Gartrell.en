==Research==

Gartrell is the Principal Researcher for the US National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study (NLLFS). The NLLFS follows lesbian mothers and their children who were conceived by donor insemination during the 1980s. The study, which was initiated by Gartrell in 1986, examines the social, psychological, and emotional development of the children as well as the dynamics of planned lesbian families. This is the longest-running and largest prospective investigation of lesbian mothers and their children in the United States.<ref name="nllfs">[http://www.nllfs.org/ The US National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study website]</ref>

In June 2010, the NLLFS study ''The USA National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study: Psychological Adjustment of the 17-Year-Old Adolescents'' was published in ''Pediatrics''.<ref>[http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2009-3153v1 ''Pediatrics'' US National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study: Psychological Adjustment of 17-Year-Old Adolescents]</ref> The study's results showed that the 17-year-olds of lesbian mothers were rated significantly higher in social, school/academic, and total competence and significantly lower in social problems, rule-breaking, aggressive, and externalizing problem behavior than their age-matched counterparts. This publication prompted international media attention including articles in The Los Angeles Times,<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/16/opinion/la-ed-prop8-20100616 ''The Los Angeles Times'' Parenting should be a nonissue in gay marriage debate]</ref> The Telegraph (UK),<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7810111/Children-raised-by-lesbians-have-fewer-behavioural-problems.html ''Telegraph UK'' Children raised by lesbians have fewer behavioural problems]</ref> Time,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1994480,00.html 'Time' Children of Lesbians May Do Better Than Their Peers]</ref> and mention on The Colbert Report.<ref>[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/312629/june-15-2010/testoster-ruin---hanna-rosin The Cobert Report, Testoster-Ruin - Hanna Rosin]</ref> ''Discover Magazine'' then named this story as one of the top 100 stories of 2010&mdash;#88: Same-Sex Parents Do No Harm.<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/discover/2011/jan-feb/88 ''Discover Magazine'' Top 100 Stories of 2010: #88 Same-Sex Parents Do No Harm]</ref>

In 2012, ''UCLA Today'' published an article "Researcher sorts out fact from fallacy in three-decade study of lesbian families" <ref>[http://today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/nanette-gartrell-2-241255.aspx "Researcher sorts out fact from fallacy in three-decade study of lesbian families"]</ref> highlighting Gartrell's 30+ years of work on the NLLFS study.
