A '''melanocytic nevus''' (also known as "Nevocytic nevus"<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|}}) is a type of [[lesion]] that contains [[nevus cell]]s (a type of melanocyte).<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000072250|melanocytic nevus}}</ref>

|accessdate=2008-08-02
|publisher=[[American Academy of Dermatology]]}}</ref> Acquired moles are a form of [[benign]] [[neoplasm]], while [[congenital]] moles, or congenital nevi, are considered a minor [[malformation]] or [[hamartoma]] and may be at a higher risk for melanoma.<ref name=aad.org/> A mole can be either subdermal (under the skin) or a pigmented growth on the [[skin]], formed mostly of a type of [[cell (biology)|cell]] known as a [[melanocyte]]. The high concentration of the body’s pigmenting agent, [[melanin]], is responsible for their dark [[color]]. Moles are a member of the family of [[skin lesions]] known as [[nevi]].

==Classification==
Some sources equate the term mole with "melanocytic nevus".[3] Other sources reserve the term "mole" for other purposes such as the animal of the same name.[4]
Melanocytic nevi represent a family of lesions. The most common variants are:
* Location:
** '''[[Junctional nevus]]''': the nevus cells are located along the junction of the [[epithelium]] and the underlying [[dermis]]. A junctional nevus is flat and brown to black.
** '''[[Compound nevus]]''': a mixture of junctional and intradermal proliferation. Compound nevi are slightly raised and brown to black. [[Beauty mark]]s are usually compound nevi of either the acquired variety or congenital variety.
** '''[[Intradermal nevus]]''': the nevus cells are located in the [[dermis]] only. Intradermal nevi are raised; most are flesh-colored (not pigmented).
* '''[[Dysplastic nevus]]''' (nevus of Clark): usually a compound nevus with cellular and architectural [[dysplasia]]. Like typical moles, dysplastic nevi can be flat or raised. While they vary in size, dysplastic nevi are typically larger than normal moles and tend to have irregular borders and irregular coloration. Hence, they resemble [[melanoma]], appear worrisome, and are often removed to clarify the diagnosis. Dysplastic nevi are markers of risk when they are numerous ('''atypical mole syndrome'''). According to the National Cancer Institute (NIH), doctors believe that, when part of a series or syndrome of multiple moles, dysplastic nevi are more likely than ordinary moles to develop into the most virulent type of skin cancer called melanoma.
* '''[[Blue nevus]]''': It is blue in color as its [[melanocytes]] are very deep in the skin. The nevus cells are spindle shaped and scattered in deep layers of the [[dermis]]. The covering [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] is normal.
* '''[[Spitz nevus]]''': a distinct variant of intradermal nevus, usually in a child. They are raised and reddish (non-pigmented). A pigmented variant, called the 'nevus of Reed', typically appears on the leg of young women.
* '''[[Acquired nevus]]''':  Any melanocytic nevus that is not a congenital nevus or not present at birth or near birth.  This includes junctional, compound and intradermal nevus.
* '''[[Congenital nevus]]''': Small to large nevus present at or near time of birth.  Small ones have low potential for forming [[melanomas]], however the risk increases with size, as in the giant pigmented nevus.
* '''[[Giant pigmented nevus]]''': these large, pigmented, often hairy congenital nevi. They are important because [[melanoma]] may occasionally (10 to 15%) appear in them.
* '''[[Intramucosal nevus]]''': junctional nevus of the mucosa of the mouth or genital areas. In the mouth, they are found most frequently on the hard palate.
* '''[[Nevus of Ito]]''' and '''[[Nevus of Ota]]''': congenital, flat brownish lesions on the face or shoulder.
* '''[[Mongolian spot]]''': congenital large, deep, bluish discoloration on the back of Asian babies.
* '''[[Recurrent nevus]]''':  Any incompletely removed nevus with residual melanocytes left in the surgical wound.  It creates a dilemma for the patient and physician, as these scars cannot be distinguished from a melanoma.

==Signs and symptoms==
According to the [[American Academy of Dermatology]], the most common types of moles are [[skin tags]], raised moles and flat moles. [[Benignity|Benign]] moles are usually circular or oval and not very large, though some can be larger than the size of a typical pencil eraser. Some moles typically produce dark, coarse [[hair]]. Common mole hair removal procedures include plucking, cosmetic waxing, [[electrology|electrolysis]], [[Threading (epilation)|threading]] and cauterization.

===Aging===
Moles tend to appear during childhood and gradually disappear after middle age. People with white skin have an average of 30 moles, with some having up to 400 moles.<ref>[http://cbs4.com/health/Moles.Youth.Staying.2.395389.html Holey Moley: Those With Moles May Live Longer.]</ref>

The number of moles a person has has a correlation with [[telomere]] length. One study found that people with over 100 moles had longer telomeres than those with under 25 moles.  The length of telomeres may be of significance in [[Senescence|the ageing process]].<ref>[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?year=2007&news_id=604 Moles linked with slower ageing]</ref> Shorter telomeres are thought to be associated with a greater risk of age-related diseases.<ref>[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?year=2007&news_id=604 Moles linked with slower ageing.]</ref>

==Cause==
===Genetics===
[[Genes]] can have an influence on a person's moles.

'''[[Dysplastic nevus|Dysplastic nevi]]''' and atypical mole syndrome are [[hereditary]] conditions which causes a person to have a large quantity of moles (often 100 or more) with some larger than normal or atypical. This often leads to a higher [[risk]] of [[melanoma]], a serious [[skin cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burkhart CG |title=Dysplastic nevus declassified: even the NIH recommends elimination of confusing terminology |journal=Skinmed |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=12–3 |year=2003 |pmid=14673319 |doi= 10.1111/j.1540-9740.2003.01724.x|url=http://www.lejacq.com/articleDetail.cfm?pid=SKINmed_2;1:12}}</ref> Dysplastic nevi are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. Dysplastic nevi are common, and many people have a few of these abnormal moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles increases the risk of developing melanoma.<ref name="ncimelanoma">{{cite web |url=http://www.nci.nih.gov/cancertopics/wyntk/melanoma/page7 |title=What You Need To Know About Melanoma - Melanoma: Who's at Risk? |accessdate=2008-05-18 |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]}}</ref>

In the overall population, a slight [[majority]] of melanomas do ''not'' form in an existing mole, but rather create a new [[tumour|growth]] on the skin. Somewhat surprisingly, this also applies to those with dysplastic nevi. They are at a higher risk of melanoma occurring not only where there is an existing mole, but also where there are none.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pope DJ, Sorahan T, Marsden JR, Ball PM, Grimley RP, Peck IM |title=Benign pigmented nevi in children. Prevalence and associated factors: the West Midlands, United Kingdom Mole Study |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=128 |issue=9 |pages=1201–6 |year=1992 |pmid=1519934 |doi= 10.1001/archderm.128.9.1201|url=}}

===Sunlight===
[[ultraviolet light|UV radiation]] from the sun causes premature aging of the skin and skin damage that can lead to melanoma. Some scientists  [[hypothesis|hypothesize]] that overexposure to UV, including excessive [[sunlight]], may play a role in the formation of acquired moles.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Schanke A, van Venrooij GM, Jongsma MJ, ''et al.'' |title=Induction of nevi and skin tumors in Ink4a/Arf Xpa knockout mice by neonatal, intermittent, or chronic UVB exposures |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=2608–15 |year=2006 |pmid=16510579 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2476 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16510579}}</ref>  However, more [[research]] is needed to determine the complex interaction between genetic makeup and overall exposure to ultraviolet light. Some strong indications that this is so (but falling short of proof), are:

* The relative lack of moles on the [[buttocks]] of people with dysplastic nevi.
* [[Freckle]]s (spots of melanin on the skin, and distinct from moles) are known to be influenced by sunlight.

Studies have found that sunburns and too much time in the sun can increase the risk factors for melanoma. This is ''in addition to'' those who have dysplastic nevi being at higher risk of this [[cancer]]. (The uncertainty is in regard to acquiring ''benign'' moles.) To prevent and reduce the risk of melanoma caused by UV radiation, the [[American Academy of Dermatology]] and the [[National Cancer Institute]] recommends staying out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. standard time (or whenever your [[shadow]] is shorter than your height). The National Cancer Institute also recommends wearing long sleeves and trousers, hats with a wide brim, sunscreens, and sunglasses that have UV-deflecting lenses.<ref name="ncimelanoma"/>

===Hormones===
Hormonal changes during [[pregnancy]] and [[Diabetes|diabetics]] (i.e. [[insulin]]) are often contributing to mole formation.

==Diagnosis==
Clinical diagnosis can be made with the naked eye using the [[ABCD guideline]] or by using [[dermatoscopy]]. An [[Moletest|online-screening test]] is also available to help screen out benign moles.

===Differentiation from melanoma===
It often requires a dermatologist to fully evaluate moles. For instance, a small blue or bluish black spot, often called a blue nevus, is usually benign but often mistaken for [[melanoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Granter SR, McKee PH, Calonje E, Mihm  MC, Busam K |title=Melanoma associated with blue nevus and melanoma mimicking cellular blue nevus: a clinicopathologic study of 10 cases on the spectrum of so-called 'malignant blue nevus' |journal=Am. J. Surg. Pathol. |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=316–23 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11224601 |doi= 10.1097/00000478-200103000-00005|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0147-5185&volume=25&issue=3&spage=316}}</ref> Conversely, a junctional nevus, which develops at the junction of the dermis and epidermis, is potentially cancerous.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hall J, Perry VE |title=Tinea nigra palmaris: differentiation from malignant melanoma or junctional nevi |journal=Cutis |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=45–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9675534 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

A basic reference chart used for [[consumer]]s to spot suspicious moles is found in the [[mnemonic]] A-B-C-D, used by institutions such as the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Cancer Institute. The letters stand for '''A'''symmetry, '''B'''order, '''C'''olor, and '''D'''iameter.<ref name=aad.org/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nci.nih.gov/cancertopics/wyntk/melanoma/page8 |title=What You Need To Know About Melanoma - Signs and Symptoms |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |accessdate=2008-05-18}}</ref> Sometimes, the letter E (for '''E'''levation or '''E'''volving) is added. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, if a mole starts changing in size, color, shape or, especially, if the [[border]] of a mole develops ragged edges or becomes larger than a [[pencil]] [[eraser]], it would be an appropriate time to consult with a physician. Other warning signs include a mole, even if smaller than a pencil eraser, that is different from the others and begins to crust over, bleed, [[itch]], or become [[inflamed]]. The changes may indicate developing [[melanomas]]. The matter can become clinically complicated because mole removal depends on which types of cancer, if any, come into suspicion.

A recent and novel method of melanoma detection is the '''"Ugly Duckling Sign"'''<ref>http://www.skincancer.org/the-ugly-duckling-sign.html</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Mascaro JM Jr, Mascaro JM. The dermatologist's position concerning nevi: a vision ranging from 'the ugly duckling' to 'little red riding hood'. Arch Dermatol 1998; 134:1484–5.
</ref> It is simple, easy to teach, and highly effective in detecting melanoma. Simply, correlation of common characteristics of a person's skin lesion is made. Lesions which greatly deviate from the common characteristics are labeled as an "Ugly Duckling", and further professional exam is required. The '''"Little Red Riding Hood"''' sign,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> suggests that individuals with fair skin and light colored hair might have difficult-to-diagnose melanomas.  Extra care and caution should be rendered when examining such individuals as they might have multiple melanomas and severely dysplastic nevi. A dermatoscope must be used to detect "ugly ducklings", as many melanomas in these individuals resemble non-melanomas or are considered to be "wolves in sheep clothing".<ref name="dermnetnz.org">http://dermnetnz.org/doctors/dermoscopy-course/introduction.html</ref> These fair skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas which will not present easy-to-observe color changes and variation in colors. The borders of these amelanotic melanomas are often indistinct, making visual identification without a [[dermatoscope]] very difficult.

People with a personal or family history of skin cancer or of [[dysplastic nevus syndrome]] (multiple atypical moles) should see a dermatologist at least once a year to be sure they are not developing melanoma.

==Complications==
Experts, such as the American Academy of Dermatology, say that vast majority of moles are [[benign]].<ref name=aad.org/> Nonetheless, the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]] estimated that 62,480 new cases of [[melanoma]] and 8,420 related deaths would appear in the United States in the year 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nci.nih.gov/cancertopics/types/melanoma |title=Melanoma Home Page |accessdate=2008-05-18 |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]}}</ref>

==Management==

First, a diagnosis must be made.  If the lesion is a [[seborrheic keratosis]], then shave excision, electrodesiccation or cryosurgery may be performed, usually leaving very little if any scarring.  If the lesion is suspected to be a [[skin cancer]], a [[skin biopsy]] must be done first, before considering removal.  This is unless an excisional biopsy is warranted.  If the lesion is a melanocytic nevus, one has to decide if it is medically indicated or not.

If a melanocytic nevus is suspected of being a [[melanoma]], it needs to be sampled or removed and sent for microscopic evaluation by a [[pathologist]] by a method called [[skin biopsy]].  One can do a complete excisional [[skin biopsy]] or a punch [[skin biopsy]], depending on the size and location of the original nevus.   Other reasons for removal may be cosmetic, or because a raised mole interferes with daily life (e.g. [[shaving]]). Removal can be by [[excisional biopsy]] or by [[shaving]]. A shaved site leaves a red mark on the site which returns to the patient’s usual skin [[color]] in about two weeks. However, there might still be a risk of spread of the melanoma, so the methods of [[ABCD guideline|Melanoma diagnosis]], including excisional biopsy, are still recommended even in these instances. Additionally, moles can be removed by laser, surgery or electrocautery.

In properly trained hands, some medical lasers are used to remove flat moles level with the surface of the skin, as well as some raised moles. While laser treatment is commonly offered and may require several appointments, other dermatologists think lasers are not the best method for removing moles because the laser only [[cauterization|cauterizes]] or, in certain cases, removes very superficial levels of skin. Moles tend to go deeper into the skin than non-invasive lasers can penetrate. After a laser treatment a [[Wound healing#Proliferative phase|scab]] is formed, which falls off about seven days later, in contrast to surgery, where the wound has to be [[surgical suture|sutured]].  A second concern about the laser treatment is that if the lesion is a melanoma, and was misdiagnosed as a benign mole, the procedure might delay diagnosis.  If the mole is incompletely removed by the laser, and the pigmented lesion regrows, it might form a [[recurrent nevus]].

Electrocautery is available as an alternative to laser cautery.  Electrocautery is a procedure that uses a light [[electrical current]] to burn moles, [[skin tags]], and [[warts]] off the skin.  Electric currents are set to a level such that they only reach the outermost layers of the skin, thus reducing the problem of scarring. Approximately 1-3 treatments may be needed to completely remove a mole. Typically, a local anesthetic is applied to the treated skin area before beginning the mole removal procedure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Habif|first=Thomas P.|title=Clinical dermatology, a color guide to diagnosis and therapy|publisher=Mosby|year=1985|isbn=0-8016-2233-6}}</ref>

For surgery, many dermatologic and plastic surgeons first use a freezing [[solution]], usually [[liquid nitrogen]], on a raised mole and then shave it away with a [[scalpel]]. If the surgeon opts for the shaving method, he or she usually also [[Cauterization|cauterizes]] the [[amputation|stump]]. Because a [[circle]] is difficult to close with stitches, the [[incision]] is usually [[elliptical]] or eye-shaped.  However, freezing should not be done to a nevus suspected to be a melanoma, as the ice crystals can cause pathological changes called "freezing artifacts" which might interfere with the diagnosis of the melanoma.

===Home removal===
Numerous products are sold [[Over-the-counter_drug|over-the-counter]] for home removal of moles and other similar skin conditions. One [[Naturopathy|naturopathic]] method that removes moles is the use of 3% food-grade [[Hydrogen Peroxide]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Mole removal risks===
Mole removal risks mainly depend on the type of mole removal method the patient undergoes. First, mole removal may be followed by some discomfort that can be relieved with [[pain medication]]. Second, there is a risk that a scab will form or that redness will occur. However, such scabs and redness usually heal within one or two weeks. Third, as in other surgeries, there is also risk of [[infection]] or an anesthetic allergy or even [[nerve damage]]. Lastly, the mole removal may imply an uncomfortable [[scar]] depending on the mole size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/mole_removal/page3_em.htm| title=Mole Removal|date=|accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref>

==History==
In the 1950s and 60s (and, to lesser extent, currently) a [[facial mole]] was known as a "[[beauty mark]]" when it appeared in certain spots on a woman’s [[face]]. Examples include [[Marilyn Monroe]], model [[Cindy Crawford]], singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], and the fictional [[Ms. Pac-Man]]. Madonna's [[facial mole]]&mdash;below her right nostril&mdash;has been surgically removed. Some [[folklore]] about moles includes the notion that picking at a mole can cause it to become [[cancerous]] or grow back larger.

==Society and culture==
[[Image:Abraham Lincoln head on shoulders photo portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Lincoln]] famously had a mole on his right cheek]]
Throughout [[human history]], individuals who have possessed facial moles have been subject to ridicule and attack based on superstition.  Throughout most of history, facial moles were not considered objects of [[beauty]] on lovely faces. Rather most moles were considered hideous growths that appeared mostly on the [[human nose|noses]], [[cheek]]s, and [[chin]]s of [[witches]], [[frog]]s and other low [[Animal|creatures]].

Both [[folklore]] and modern [[popular culture]] use physical traits to denote a character's either [[Good and evil|good]] or [[evil]] tendencies. In contrast to the fine features and smooth skin of its heroes and heroines, characters who possess negative or evil characteristics have also been known to possess more rugged features and skin blemishes, including facial moles.

In [[Medieval Europe]], among those accused of demonic possession, ecclesiastical edicts interpreted large [[warts]] and moles on the skin as physical signs of the entry point of the [[devil]] into the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].<ref>[http://www.routledge-ny.com/ref/criminology/physical.html Encyclopedia of Criminology]</ref>

In the 16th century, a popular [[pseudoscience]] was invented that supposedly described how every facial mole had a corresponding [[birthmark]] somewhere else on the [[body]]. Once you knew where both moles were, the theory went, you had the inside track on what made the person tick. For instance, if a man had a mole on the bridge of his [[human nose|nose]], he supposedly had another on his right [[thigh]]. Taken together, the moles meant the owners were persons of good [[Mood (psychology)|moods]] and would eventually receive healthy [[inheritance]]s.<ref>[http://www.cosmeticsurgery.com/articles/archive/an~221 Facial Moles in History.]</ref>

===Face mole reading===

In traditional Chinese culture, facial moles are respected and they are used in [[moleomancy]], or face mole reading. The moles' meaning varies according to which of the nine "wealth spots" of the face they are located in. Depending on their position and color, a person's facial moles may render their face "lucky" or "unlucky."

Moles that can be easily seen may be considered warnings or reminders, while hidden moles may symbolize good luck and fortune. Furthermore, traditional Chinese culture holds that each facial mole indicates the presence of a corresponding mole on another part of the body. For instance, if a mole is present around the mouth, a corresponding mole should be found in the pubic region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinesefortunecalendar.com/FaceMoleReading.htm| title=Chinese Face Reading - Facial Mole and Your Fate|date=|accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref>
