For people who can access health care practitioners or peer support it is the process whereby persons with long-term conditions (and often family/friend/carer) share knowledge, responsibility and care plans with healthcare practitioners and/or peers. To be effective it requires whole system implementation with community social support networks, a range of satisfying occupations and activities relevant to the context, clinical professionals willing to act as partners or coaches and on-line resources which are verified and relevant to the country and context. Knowledge sharing, knowledge building and a learning community are integral to the concept of disease management. It is a population health strategy as well as an approach to personal health. It may reduce healthcare costs and/or improve [[quality of life]] for individuals by preventing or minimizing the effects of [[disease]], usually a [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] condition, through knowledge, skills, enabling a sense of control over life (despite symptoms of disease) and integrative care.

==History==
Disease management has evolved from [[managed care]], specialty capitation, and health service [[demand management]], and refers to the processes and people concerned with improving or maintaining health in large populations. It is concerned with common [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] illnesses, and the reduction of future complications associated with those diseases.

Illnesses that disease management would concern itself with would include: [[coronary heart disease]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), [[kidney failure]], [[hypertension]], [[heart failure]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[asthma]], [[cancer]], [[arthritis]], [[clinical depression]], [[sleep apnea]], [[osteoporosis]], and other common ailments.

== Process ==
The underlying premise of disease management is that when the right tools, ...experts, and equipment are applied to a population, labor costs (specifically: absenteeism, presenteeism, and direct insurance expenses) can be minimized in the near term, or resources can be provided more efficiently. The general idea is to ease the disease path, rather than cure the disease. Improving quality and activities for daily living are first and foremost. Improving cost, in some programs, is a necessary component, as well. However, some disease management systems believe that reductions in longer term problems may not be measureable today, but may warrant continuation of disease management programs until better data is available in 10–20 years. Most disease management vendors offer [[return on investment]] (ROI) for their programs, although over the years there have been dozens of ways to measure ROI. Responding to this inconsistency, an industry trade association, the [[Care Continuum Alliance]], convened industry leaders to develop consensus guidelines for measuring clinical and financial outcomes in disease management, wellness and other population-based programs. Contributing to the work were public and private health and quality organizations, including the federal [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]], the [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]], [[URAC]], and the [[Joint Commission]]. The project produced the first volume of a now four-volume Outcomes Guidelines Report, which details industry-consensus approaches to measuring outcomes.

Tools include web-based assessment tools, clinical guidelines, health risk assessments, outbound and inbound call-center-based triage, best practices, formularies, and numerous other devices, systems and protocols.  

Experts include [[actuary|actuaries]], [[physician]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[economist|medical economists]], [[nurse]]s, [[nutritionist]]s, [[physical therapist]]s, [[statistician]]s, [[epidemiologist]]s, and [[human resources|human resources professionals]]. Equipment can include mailing systems, web-based applications (with or without interactive modes), monitoring devices, or telephonic systems.

==Studies of effectiveness of disease management==
===Possible biases and other problems in effectiveness studies===
When disease management programs are voluntary, studies of their effectiveness may be affected by a [[self-selection bias]]; that is, a program may "attract enrollees who were [already] highly motivated to succeed".<ref>Kominski GF, et al.

Even if a particular study is a randomized trial, it may not provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of disease management. A 2009 review paper examined randomized trials and meta-analyses of disease management programs for heart failure and asserted that many failed the [[PICO process]] and [[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials]]: "interventions and comparisons are not sufficiently well described; that complex programs have been excessively oversimplified; and that potentially salient differences in programs, populations, and settings are not incorporated into analyses."<ref name="Clark-2009">{{Cite journal | title = What is the strength of evidence for heart failure disease-management programs? | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 54 | pages = 397–401 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.04.051 | pmid = 19628113 | url = http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/full/54/5/397 | issue=5 | author = Clark AM, et al}}</ref>
