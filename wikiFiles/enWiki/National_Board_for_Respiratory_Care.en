The '''National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC) Inc.''' is a [[non-profit]] organization<ref>http://www.nbrc.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=HJdjQ3HXDg4%3d&tabid=57&mid=382</ref> formed in 1986 with the purpose of awarding and maintaining credentialing for [[Respiratory therapist]]s in the [[United States]].  The NBRC is the only organization in the United States which develops certification examinations for [[Registered Respiratory Therapist]]s (RRTs) and [[Certified Respiratory Therapist]]s (CRTs).  The NBRC also offers additional specialization credentialing for [[respiratory practitioner]]s that hold its certifications.  The CRT and RRT designations are the standard credential in respiratory care for licensure requirements in the portions of the [[United States]] that have enacted a [[Respiratory Care Act]].  States that license [[respiratory therapist]]s sometimes require the practitioner to maintain their NBRC credentialing to maintain their license to practice.<ref name="pmid16477201">{{cite journal| author=Mathews P, Drumheller L, Carlow JJ, with the assistance of the American Association for Respiratory Care.

==Certification levels==
===Entry level certification===
Certification is the entry level and is separated as such by the NBRC.  [[Certified Respiratory Therapist]]s and Certified [[Pulmonary Function Technologist]]s require oversight and supervision by their advanced-practice counterparts.

===Advanced practice certification===
The term the NBRC uses to designate an advanced practitioner is "registered" and the addition to an advanced practitioner registry which is not permanent but has a re-certification fee associated with it.   [[Registered Respiratory Therapist]] and [[Registered Pulmonary Function Technologist]] are currently the advanced credentialings maintained by the NBRC.

===Specialties===
The NBRC has sub-specialties for the [[Respiratory Therapist]] designations.  Both the CRT and the RRT are eligible to sit for additional credentialing but the CRT still requires the same supervision by the RRT in clinical applications.  

'''Sleep Disorders Specialist''' — The sleep disorder specialist (RRT-SDS or CRT-SDS) is a credential recognized by the [[American Academy of Sleep Medicine]] for the role of Scoring in sleep studies.

'''Neonatal & Pediatric Specialist''' — The neonatal and pediatric specialist (RRT-NPS or CRT-NPS) is a [[respiratory therapist]] that may work in advanced care in pediatrics and neonatology centers and units.

'''Adult Critical Care Specialist''' — The adult critical care specialist is only available to the RRT (RRT-ACCS) that is a pulmonary and hemodymanic specialist in intensive medicine in adult practice.

==Testing==
The NBRC owns its own testing corporation, the for-profit company [[Applied Measurement Professionals]].<ref>http://www.nbrc.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=pY3QCd7Ufq0%3D&tabid=57&mid=382 ; AMP website, http://www.goamp.com/ .</ref>  AMP is a private stock corporation located in the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]].
