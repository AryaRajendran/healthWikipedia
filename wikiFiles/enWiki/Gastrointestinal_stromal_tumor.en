A '''gastrointestinal stromal tumor''' ('''GIST''') is one of the most common [[mesenchyme|mesenchymal]] [[tumors]] of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] (1-3% of all gastrointestinal malignancies). They are typically defined as tumors whose behavior is driven by [[genetic mutation|mutation]]s in the [[CD117|Kit]] [[gene]] or [[PDGFRA]] gene, and may or may not [[staining|stain]] positively for Kit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miettinen M, Lasota J |title=Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: review on morphology, molecular pathology, prognosis, and differential diagnosis |journal=Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. |volume=130 |issue=10 |pages=1466–78 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17090188 |doi= 10.1043/1543-2165(2006)130[1466:GSTROM]2.0.CO;2|url=http://journals.allenpress.com/jrnlserv/?request=get-abstract&issn=0003-9985&volume=130&page=1466}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Patients present with [[dysphagia|trouble swallowing]], [[gastrointestinal hemorrhage]] or [[metastasis|metastases]] (mainly in the liver). Intestinal obstruction is rare, due to the tumor's outward pattern of growth.  Often, there is a history of vague [[abdominal pain]] or discomfort, and the tumor has become rather large by time the diagnosis is made.

Generally, the definitive diagnosis is made with a [[biopsy]], which can be obtained [[endoscope|endoscopically]], percutaneously with CT or ultrasound guidance or at the time of surgery.

==Diagnosis==
As part of the analysis, [[blood test]]s and [[Computed axial tomography|CT scanning]] are often undertaken (see the ''[[#Radiology|radiology]]'' section).

A [[biopsy]] sample will be investigated under the [[light microscopy|microscope]]. The [[histopathology|histopathologist]] identifies the characteristics of GISTs (spindle cells in 70-80%, epitheloid aspect in 20-30%). Smaller tumors can usually be found to the muscularis propria layer of the intestinal wall.  Large ones grow, mainly outward, from the bowel wall until the point where they outstrip their blood supply and necrose (die) on the inside, forming a cavity that may eventually come to communicate with the bowel lumen.

When GIST is suspected&mdash;as opposed to other causes for similar tumors&mdash;the pathologist can use [[immunohistochemistry]] (specific [[antibody|antibodies]] that stain the molecule [[CD117]] (also known as ''c-kit'') &mdash;see below). 95% of all GISTs are CD117-positive (other possible markers include [[CD34]], DOG-1, [[desmin]], and [[vimentin]]). Other cells that show CD117 positivity are [[mast cell]]s. 

If the CD117 stain is negative and suspicion remains that the tumor is a GIST, the newer antibody DOG-1 (Discovered On GIST-1) can be used. Also [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] of Kit and PDGFRA can be used to prove the diagnosis.

==Radiology==
The purpose of radiologic imaging  is to locate the lesion, evaluate for signs of invasion and detect [[metastasis]]. Features of GIST vary depending on tumor size and organ of origin. The diameter can range from a few millimeters to more than 30 cm.  Larger tumors usually cause symptoms in contrast to those found incidentally which tend to be smaller and have better prognosis.<ref name=hersh>{{cite journal |author=Hersh MR, Choi J, Garrett C, Clark R.|title=Imaging Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors |journal= Cancer Control |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=111–115 |year=2005 |pmid=15855894}}</ref> <ref name=burkill>{{cite journal |author=Burkill GJ, Badran M, Al-Muderis O, Meirion Thomas J, Judson IR, Fisher C, Moskovic EC. |title=Malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor: distribution, imaging features, and pattern of metastatic spread |journal=Radiology |volume=226 |issue=2 |pages=527–32 |year=2003 |pmid= 12563150 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2262011880}}</ref> Although the majority of [[cancer|malignant]] tumors are large, small GISTs may also demonstrate clinically aggressive behavior.<ref name=pidhorecky>{{cite journal |author=Pidhorecky I, Cheney RT, Kraybill WG, Gibbs JF |title=Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: current diagnosis, biologic behavior, and management |journal=Ann Surg Oncol |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=705–12 |year=2000 |pmid=11034250 |doi=10.1007/s10434-000-0705-6}}</ref> <ref name=lehnert >{{cite journal |author=Lehnert T |title=Gastrointestinal sarcoma (GIST)--a review of surgical management |journal=Ann Chir Gynaecol |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=297–305 |year=1998 |pmid=9891770}}</ref>
[[File:CT image of a GIST tumor in the gastric cardia.jpg|thumb|CT image of a GIST tumor in the gastric cardia.  The lesion appears submucosal, hypervascular and protrudes intraluminally.  The patient presented with upper GI bleeding, at endoscopy, the lesion was ulcerated.]]

=== Small GISTs ===
Since GISTs arise from the bowel layer called [[Muscular layer|muscularis propria]] (which is deeper to the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]] and [[submucosa]] from a [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] perspective), small GIST imaging usually suggest a submucosal process or a mass within the bowel wall. In [[barium swallow]] studies, these GIST most commonly present with smooth borders forming right or obtuse angles with the nearby bowel wall, as seen with any other intramural mass. The mucosal surface is usually intact except for areas of ulceration, which are generally present in 50% of GISTs. Ulcerations fill with barium causing a bull’s eye or target lesion appearance. In contrast-enhanced [[X-ray computed tomography| CT]], small GISTs are seen as smooth, sharply defined intramural masses with homogeneous attenuation.

=== Large GISTs ===
As the tumor grows it may project outside the bowel (exophytic growth) and/or inside the bowel (intraluminal growth), but they most commonly grow exophytically such that the bulk of the tumor projects into the abdominal cavity. If the tumor outstrips its blood supply, it can [[necrosis|necrose]] internally, creating a central fluid-filled cavity with hemorrhage and [[cavitation|cavitations]] that can eventually ulcerate and communicate into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the bowel. In that case, barium swallow may show an air, air-fluid levels or oral contrast media accumulation within these areas.<ref name="pidhorecky" /> <ref name="lehnert" /> Mucosal ulcerations may also be present. In contrast enhanced CT images, large GISTs appear as heterogeneous masses due to areas of living tumor cells surrounding hemorrhage, necrosis or cysts, which is radiographically seen as a peripheral enhancement pattern with a low attenuation center.<ref name="hersh" /> In [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] studies, the degree of necrosis and hemorrhage affects the signal intensity pattern. Areas of hemorrhage within the tumor will vary its signal intensity depending on how long ago the hemorrhage occurred. The solid portions of the tumor are typically low signal intensity on [[Magnetic_resonance_imaging#T1-weighted_MRI|T1-weighted images]], are high signal intensity on [[Magnetic_resonance_imaging#T2-weighted_MRI|T2-weighted images]] and enhance after administration of [[gadolinium]]. Signal-intensity voids are present if there is gas within areas of necrotic tumor.<ref name=shojaku >{{cite journal |author=Shojaku H, Futatsuya R, Seto H, et al |title=Malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the small intestine: radiologic-pathologic correlation |journal=Radiat Med |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=189–92 |year=1997 |pmid=9278378}}</ref> <ref name=levine >{{cite journal |author=Levine MS, Buck JL, Pantongrag-Brown L, et al |title=Leiomyosarcoma of the esophagus: radiographic findings in 10 patients |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=167|issue=1 |pages=27–32 |year=1996 |pmid=8659399}}</ref> <ref name=tervahartiala >{{cite journal |author=Tervahartiala P, Halavaara J. |title=Radiology of GIST.

=== Features of malignancy ===
Most GISTs (70-80%) are benign.<ref name="burkill" /> <ref name=nishida >{{cite journal |author=Nishida T, Hirota S |title=Biological and clinical review of stromal tumors in the gastrointestinal tract |journal=Histol Histopathol |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=1293–301 |year=2000 |pmid=11005253}}</ref> <ref name=miettinen2>{{cite journal |author=Miettinen M, Lasota J |title=Gastrointestinal stromal tumors--definition, clinical, histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic features and differential diagnosis |journal=Virchows Arch |volume=438 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |year=2001 |pmid=11213830 |doi=10.1007/s004280000338}}</ref> [[cancer|Malignancy]] is characterized by local invasion and metastases, usually to the [[liver]], [[greater omentum|omentum]] and [[peritoneum]]. However, cases of metastases to bone, [[pleural cavity|pleura]], [[lung|lungs]] and [[retroperitoneal space|retroperitoneum]] have been seen. In distinction to gastric [[adenocarcinoma]] or gastric/small bowel [[lymphoma]], malignant [[lymphadenopathy]] (swollen lymph nodes) is uncommon (&lt;10%) and thus imaging usually shows absence of lymph node enlargement.<ref name="hersh" /> Unless metastatic disease or tumor invasion of adjacent structures is seen, the distinction between benign and malignant GISTs cannot be made with radiologic examination. If metastases are not present, other radiologic features suggesting malignancy include: size (&gt;5&nbsp;cm), heterogeneous enhancement after contrast administration and ulcerations.<ref name="hersh" /> <ref name="burkill" /> <ref name=ulusan >{{cite journal |author=Ulusan S, Koc Z, Kayaselcuk  F |title=Gastrointestinal stromal tumours: CT findings |journal=Br J Radiol |volume=81 |pages=618–623 |year=2008 |pmid=18628330 |doi=10.1259/bjr/90134736 |issue=968}}</ref> Also, malignant behavior is rarely seen in gastric tumors, with a ratio of benign to malignant 3-5:1.<ref name="burkill" /> Even if radiographic malignant features are present, these findings may also represent other tumors and definitive diagnosis must be made [[immunochemistry|immunochemically]].

=== Comparison among imaging modalities ===
[[barium swallow|Barium fluoroscopic]] examinations and [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] are commonly used to evaluate the patient with abdominal complaints. Barium swallow images show abnormalities in 80% of GIST cases.<ref name="pidhorecky" /> However, some GISTs may be located entirely outside the lumen of the bowel and will not be appreciated with a barium swallow. Even in cases when the barium swallow is abnormal, an MRI or CT scan must follow since it is impossible to evaluate abdominal cavities and other abdominal organs with a barium swallow alone. In a CT scan, abnormalities may be seen in 87% of patients and it should be made with both oral and intravenous contrast.<ref name="pidhorecky" />  Among imaging studies, MRI has the best tissue contrast, which aids in the identification of masses within the GI tract (intramural masses). Intravenous contrast material is needed to evaluate lesion vascularity. 

[[projectional radiography|Plain radiographs]] are not very helpful in the evaluation of GISTs. If an abnormality is seen, it will be an indirect sign due to the tumor mass effect on adjacent organs. On [[abdominal x-ray]], stomach GISTs may appear as a [[radiodensity|radiopaque]] mass altering the shape of the gastric air shadow. Intestinal GISTs may displace loops of bowel and larger tumors may obstruct the bowel and films will show an [[bowel obstruction|obstructive pattern]]. If [[cavitation|cavitations]] are present, plain radiographs will show collections of air within the tumor.<ref name="shojaku" /> [[Calcification]] is an unusual feature of GIST but if present can be visible on plain films. 

Preferred imaging modalities in the evaluation of GISTs are CT and MRI. CT advantages include its ability to demonstrate evidence of nearby organ invasion, ascites and metastases. The ability of MRI to produce images in multiple planes is helpful in determining the bowel as the organ of origin (which is difficult when the tumor is very large), facilitating diagnosis.

== Pathophysiology ==
GISTs are tumors of [[connective tissue]], i.e. [[sarcoma]]s; unlike [[bowel cancer|most gastrointestinal tumor]]s, they are non[[epithelium|epithelial]]. About 70% occur in the [[stomach]], 20% in the [[small intestine]] and less than 10% in the [[esophagus]]. Small tumors are generally benign, especially when [[mitosis|cell division]] rate is slow, but large tumors disseminate to the [[liver]], [[Greater omentum|omentum]] and [[peritoneal cavity]]. They rarely occur in other abdominal organs.

Some tumors of the stomach and small bowel, referred to as [[leiomyosarcoma]]s (malignant tumor of [[smooth muscle]]), would most likely be reclassified as GISTs today on the basis of immunohistochemical staining.

GISTs are thought to arise from [[interstitial cells of Cajal]] (ICC),<ref name=miettinen>{{cite journal |author=Miettinen M, Lasota J |title=Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: review on morphology, molecular pathology, prognosis, and differential diagnosis |journal=Arch Pathol Lab Med |volume=130 |issue=10 |pages=1466–78 |year=2006 |pmid=17090188 |doi=10.1043/1543-2165(2006)130[1466:GSTROM]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> that are normally part of the [[autonomic nervous system]] of the intestine. They serve a pacemaker function in controlling [[motility]].

Most (50-80%) GISTs arise because of a mutation in a [[gene]] called ''[[c-kit]]''. This gene encodes a [[transmembrane receptor]] for a growth factor termed [[stem cell factor]] (''scf''). The ''c-kit'' product/CD117 is expressed on ICCs and a large number of other cells, mainly [[bone marrow]] cells, [[mast cell]]s, [[melanocyte]]s and several others. In the gut, however, a mass staining positive for [[CD117]] is likely to be a GIST, arising from ICC cells.

The ''c-kit'' [[molecule]] comprises a long [[Membrane protein|extracellular domain]], a [[Membrane protein|transmembrane segment]], and an intracellular part. Mutations generally occur in the [[deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]] encoding the intracellular part (exon 11), which acts as a [[tyrosine kinase]] to activate other [[enzyme]]s. Mutations make ''c-kit'' function independent of activation by ''scf'', leading to a high cell division rate and possibly genomic instability. Additional mutations are likely "required" for a cell with a ''c-kit'' mutation to develop into a GIST, but the ''c-kit'' mutation is probably the first step of this process.

The [[tyrosine kinase]] function of ''c-kit'' is vital in the therapy for GISTs, as described below.

==Heritability==
Although some families with [[genetic disorder|hereditary]] GISTs have been described, most cases are sporadic.

In GIST cells, the ''c-kit'' gene is mutated approximately 85% to 90% of the time.  35% of the GIST cells with wildtype (i.e. not mutated) ''c-kit'' instead have a mutation in another gene, PDGFR-α ([[PDGFRA|platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha]]), which is a related tyrosine kinase.

Mutations in the [[exon]]s 11, 9 and rarely 13 and 17 of the ''c-kit'' gene are known to occur in GIST. D816V [[point mutation]]s in ''c-kit'' exon 17 are responsible for resistance to targeted therapy drugs like [[imatinib mesylate]], a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Mutations in ''c-kit'' and ''PDGFrA'' are mutually exclusive [http://www.liferaftgroup.org/gist_genetics.html][http://www.liferaftgroup.org/LondnPPT/Fletcher/Fletcher_files/frame.htm].

==Therapy==
Tumor size, mitotic rate, and location can be used to predict the risk of recurrence in GIST patients. Tumors <2&nbsp;cm with a mitotic rate of <5/50 HPF have been shown to have lower risk of recurrence than larger or more aggressive tumors. Nevertheless, all GIST tumors should be considered to have malignant potential and no GIST tumor can be correctly classified as "benign." 
<ref>{{cite journal |author=Raut, Chandrajit and Dematteo, Ronald |title=Evidence-Guided Surgical Management of GIST: Beyond a Simple Case of Benign and Malignant |journal=Ann. Surg. Onc. |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=1542 |year=2008 |month=March |doi=10.1245/s10434-008-9817-1 }}</ref>

Surgery is the mainstay of therapy for nonmetastatic GISTs.  Lymph node metastases are rare, and routine removal of lymph nodes is typically not necessary. Laparoscopic surgery, a minimally invasive abdominal surgery using telescopes and specialized instruments, has been shown to be effective for removal of these tumors without needing large incisions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nguyen SQ, Divino CM, Wang JL, Dikman SH |title=Laparoscopic management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors |journal=Surg Endosc |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=713–6 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16502196 |doi=10.1007/s00464-005-0435-8 }}</ref>The clinical issues of exact surgical indications for tumor size are controversial. The decision of appropriate laparoscopic surgery is affected by tumor size, location, and growth pattern.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Chung-Ho|coauthors=Hyun, Myung-Han; Kwon, Ye-Ji; Cho, Sung-Il; Park, Sung-Soo|title=Deciding Laparoscopic Approaches for Wedge Resection in Gastric Submucosal Tumors: A Suggestive Flow Chart Using Three Major Determinants|journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons|date=NaN undefined NaN|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.07.009}}</ref> 

Until recently, GISTs were notorious for being resistant to [[chemotherapy]], with a success rate of <5%. Recently, the ''c-kit'' [[tyrosine kinase]] inhibitor [[imatinib]] (Glivec/Gleevec), a drug initially marketed for [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]], was found to be useful in treating GISTs, leading to a 40-70% response rate in metastatic or inoperable cases.

The two year survival of patients with advanced disease has risen to 75–80% following imatinib treatment.<ref name=Shrey2009>{{cite journal |url=http://www.touchoncology.com/articles/efficacy-imatinib-unresectablemetastatic-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors |title=http://www.touchoncology.com/articles/efficacy-imatinib-unresectablemetastatic-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors |author= Patel Shreyaskumar R, Wong Patrick |year=2009 |journal=US Oncology |volume=5(1) |pages=61–4 }}</ref>

Data presented at the 2007 ASCO meeting showed adjuvant treatment with imatinib following surgical resection of GIST tumors can significantly reduce the risk of disease recurrence (6% recurrence on imatinib vs. 17% without therapy at 12 months). The optimal duration of adjuvant therapy is currently unknown; trials are ongoing evaluating treatment durations of 1, 2, and 3 years.

Patients who develop resistance to imatinib may respond to the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor [[sunitinib]] (marketed as Sutent).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onclive.com/publications/contemporary-oncology/2011/spring-2011/the-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-gastrointestinal-stomal-tumors-gist |title=The Use of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) |date=14 Sept 2011 |work=Contemporary Oncology }}</ref>

The effectiveness of [[imatinib]] and [[sunitinib]] depend on the genotype.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genengnews.com/news/bnitem.aspx?name=45436906&source=genwire |title=News: Genetic Variations in GI Tumors Determine Which Medications Are Efficacious. |date=13 Nov 2008 |work=Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
GISTs occur in 10-20 per one million people. The true incidence might be higher, as novel laboratory methods are much more sensitive in diagnosing GISTs. In all, there are approximately 3500-5000 cases of GIST per year in the United States. This makes GIST the most common form of [[sarcoma]], which constitutes more than 70 types of cancer, but in all forms constitutes less than 1% of all cancer.

==History==
Until the 1990s, all non[[epithelium|epithelial]] [[tumor]]s of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] were called "gastrointestinal stromal tumors" from [[smooth muscle]] origin. [[Histopathology|Histopathologists]] generally did not distinguish between the types, as this did not affect either therapy or prognosis. Subsequently, [[Cluster of differentiation|CD34]], and later CD117 were identified as markers that could distinguish the various types.
