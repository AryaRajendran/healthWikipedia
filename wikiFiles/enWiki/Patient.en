A '''patient''' is any recipient of [[health care]] services. The patient is most often [[illness|ill]] or [[injured]] and in need of [[therapy|treatment]] by a [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], [[advanced practice registered nurse]], [[veterinarian]], or other [[health care provider]].

The word '''[[wikt:patient|patient]]''' originally meant 'one who suffers'. This English noun comes from the [[Latin]] word ''patiens'', the [[present participle]] of the [[deponent verb|deponent]] verb, [[wikt:patior|patior]], meaning 'I am suffering,' and akin to the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb πάσχειν (= ''paskhein'', to suffer) and its cognate noun [[wikt:πάθος|πάθος]] (= [[wikt:pathos|pathos]]).

==Outpatients and inpatients==
An '''outpatient''' (or '''out-patient''') is a patient who is not hospitalized for 24 hours or more but who visits a [[hospital]], [[clinic]], or associated facility for diagnosis or treatment. Treatment provided in this fashion is called [[ambulatory care]].  Sometimes surgery is performed without the need for a formal hospital admission or an overnight stay. This is called [[outpatient surgery]].  Outpatient surgery has many benefits, including reducing the amount of [[medication]] prescribed and using the physician's or surgeon's time more efficiently. More procedures are now being performed in a [[surgeon]]'s office, termed ''office-based surgery'', rather than in a hospital-based [[operating room]]. Outpatient surgery is suited best for healthy patients undergoing minor or intermediate procedures (limited urologic, ophthalmologic, or ear, nose, and throat procedures and procedures involving the extremities).

An '''inpatient''' (or '''in-patient'''), on the other hand, is "admitted" to the hospital and stays overnight or for an indeterminate time, usually several days or weeks (though some cases, such as [[coma]] patients, have been in hospitals for years).  Treatment provided in this fashion is called [[inpatient care]]. The admission to the hospital involves the production of an [[admission note]]. The leaving of the hospital is officially termed ''discharge'', and involves a corresponding ''discharge note''.

Misdiagnosis is the leading cause of [[medical error]] in outpatient facilities. Ever since the National Institute of Medicine’s groundbreaking 1999 [http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/1999/To-Err-is-Human/To%20Err%20is%20Human%201999%20%20report%20brief.pdf report], “To Err is Human,” found up to 98,000 hospital patients die from preventable medical errors in the U.S. each year, government and private sector efforts have focused on inpatient safety.<ref>{{cite web|last=Janet|first=Howard|title=Malpractice Lawsuits Shed Light on Ailing Outpatient System|url=http://myadvocatesblog.com/malpractice/malpractice-lawsuits-shed-light-on-ailing-outpatient-system|work=My Advocates|accessdate=28 June 2011}}</ref> While patient safety efforts have focused on inpatient hospital settings for more than a decade, medical errors are even more likely to happen in a [[doctor’s office]] or outpatient clinic or center.

==Alternative terminology==
Due to concerns such as [[dignity]], [[human rights]] and [[political correctness]], the term "patient" is not always used to refer to a person receiving health care. Other terms that are sometimes used include '''health consumer''', '''health care consumer''' or '''client'''.  However, such terminology may be offensive to those receiving public health care as it implies a business relationship.  (In at least some countries, it is illegal to practice business within any public hospital.) In veterinary medicine, the '''client''' is the owner or guardian of the patient. These may be used by governmental agencies, insurance companies, patient groups, or health care facilities. Individuals who use or have used [[psychiatric]] services may alternatively refer to themselves as [[Psychiatric survivors movement|consumers, users, or survivors]].

In [[nursing home]]s and [[assisted living]] facilities, the term '''resident''' is generally used in lieu of ''patient'',<ref>Foundations of Caregiving, published by the [[American Red Cross]]</ref> but it is not uncommon for staff members at such a facility to use the term ''patient'' in reference to residents. Similarly, those receiving [[home health care]] are called ''clients''.

==Patient satisfaction==
Patients' satisfaction with an encounter with [[health care service]] is mainly dependent on the duration and efficiency of care, and how empathetic and communicable the health care providers are.<ref name=pulia2011>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/743875?src=mp&spon=25 Simple Tips to Improve Patient Satisfaction] By Michael Pulia. American Academy of Emergency Medicine. 2011;18(1):18–19.</ref> It is favored by a good [[doctor-patient relationship]]. Also, patients that are well informed of the necessary procedures in a clinical encounter, and the time it is expected to take, are generally more satisfied even if there is a longer waiting time.<ref name=pulia2011/>
