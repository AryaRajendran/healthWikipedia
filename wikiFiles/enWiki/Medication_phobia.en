In severe, excessive and irrational, cases it may be a type of [[specific phobia]]. 

While lack of awareness by patient or doctor of [[adverse drug reactions]] can have serious consequences, having a [[phobia]] of medications can also have serious detrimental effects on patient health, for example refusal of necessary pharmacological interventions.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Marks |first1=R. |title=Pharmaphilia and pharmaphobia |journal=Clin Dermatol |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=69–71 |year=2001 |doi=10.1016/S0738-081X(00)00215-7 |pmid=11369491}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Drugs that call for extra caution.

Lack of awareness of the patient's [[predisposition]] to adverse effects (e.g. anxious patients and the elderly) and failure to attribute the adverse effects to the drug serves to compound the phobia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=M.d.

Fears of medication use is also prevalent in people who have experienced unpleasant withdrawal effects from [[psychotropic drugs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://benzo.org.uk/manual/ |title=Benzodiazepines: how they work & how to withdraw |author=Ashton CH |year=2002 |work=The Ashton Manual |publisher=benzo.org.uk |accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref> Sometimes patients wrongly associate symptoms of an acute disease or illness with medications used to treat the disease or illness. This form of pharmacophobia can be treated by attempting to convince the patient to take test doses of the drug or another drug in the same drug class to prove to the patient that the symptoms were not due to the drug but due to the illness the drug was taken to treat.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mastrovich |first1=JD |last2=Patterson |first2=R |last3=Davison |first3=R |last4=Harris |first4=KE |title=Using test dose challenges to restore essential therapy in patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis and pharmacophobia: report of a patient with idiopathic anaphylaxis and statin phobia |journal=Allergy Asthma Proc |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=303–9 |pmid=11715221}}</ref>
