The '''iris sphincter muscle''' ('''pupillary sphincter''', '''pupillary constrictor''', '''circular muscle of iris''', '''circular fibers''') is a [[muscle]] in the part of the [[human eye|eye]] called the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. It encircles the pupil of the iris, appropriate to its function as a constrictor of the pupil.

==Comparative Anatomy==
It is found in [[vertebrate]]s and some [[cephalopod]]s.

==General Structure==
Initially, all the [[myocytes]] are of the [[smooth muscle]] type but, later in life, most cells are of the [[striated muscle]] type.<ref>[http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/7/12/3813.pdf jneurosci.org Muscarinic and Nicotinic Synaptic Activation of the Developing..]</ref>

Its dimensions are about 0.75&nbsp;mm wide by 0.15&nbsp;mm thick.

==Mode of Action==
In humans, it functions to constrict the [[pupil]] in bright light ([[pupillary reflex]]) or during [[accommodation reflex|accommodation]].

==Innervation==
It is controlled by [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] fibers that originate from the [[Edinger-Westphal nucleus]], travel along the [[oculomotor nerve]] (CN III), synapse in the [[ciliary ganglion]], and then enter the eye via the [[short ciliary nerve]]s.
