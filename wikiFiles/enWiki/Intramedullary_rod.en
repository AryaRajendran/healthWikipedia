An '''intramedullary rod''', also known as an '''[[intramedullary]] nail''' (IM nail) or inter-locking nail or Küntscher nail, is a metal rod forced into the [[medullary cavity]] of a [[bone]]. IM nails have long been used to treat [[Bone fracture|fractures]] of [[long bones]] of the body. [[Gerhard Küntscher]] is credited with the first use of this device in 1939,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aofoundation.org/Documents/ao_dialogue_2006_01.pdf|title=AO Dialogue 2206: The magazine of AO community|format=PDF|page=42 |publisher=AO Foundation|accessdate=2013-03-12}} </ref><ref name="Bulletin of the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases, Volume 64, Numbers 3 & 4, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.nyuhjdbulletin.org/Mod/Bulletin/V64N3-4/Docs/V64N3-4_2.pdf|title=The History of Intramedullary Nailing

Prior to that, treatment of such fractures was limited to [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] or [[plaster]], both of which required long periods of inactivity. IM nails resulted in earlier return to activity for the soldiers, sometimes even within a span of a few weeks, since they share the load with the bone, rather than entirely supporting the bone.<ref name=WHFEMFRX>{{cite web|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/intramedullary_nailing_of_femoral_shaft_frx|title=Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics - Intramedullary Nailing of Femoral Shaft Frx|publisher=Duke Orthopaedics|accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref>

== Design ==
The earliest IM nails were triangular or 'V' shaped in cross-section. Later they were modified to their present and more rotationally stable clover-leaf shape.<ref name="Bulletin of the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases, Volume 64, Numbers 3 & 4, 2006"/> Several modifications and shapes were introduced subsequently for various bones such as V-nails for [[tibia]], [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] nails, Rusch nails etc. 

Although [[stainless steel]] was used for older IM nails, [[titanium]] has several advantages, including lower mechanical failure rates and improved [[biocompatibility]].<ref name="LeungTaglang2006">{{cite book|author1=Kwok-Sui Leung|author2=Gilbert Taglang|author3=Hartmut Seidel|coauthors=Ivan Kempf, Reinhard Schnettler, H J Th M Haarman, Volker Alt|title=Practice of intramedullary locked nails: new developments in techniques and applications|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uy8Q3cfF_cMC&pg=PA100|accessdate=20 December 2011|date=15 February 2006|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-540-25349-5|page=100}}</ref>  However the biggest problem with the earlier designs was the failure to prevent collapse or rotation in inherently unstable fractures. This was addressed by the introduction of the concept of 'locking' of the nails using bolts on each end of the nail(thus fixing the nail to the bony cortex and preventing rotation among the fragments), leading to emergence of locked IM nailing, which is the standard today.<ref name=WHFEMFRX/>

== Complications ==

Long-term complications a patient may develop after the implantation of an intramedullary rod may include persistent or permanent knee pain (present in 73.2% of patients studied), atrophy of the [[calf muscle]] (27.3%), atrophy of the quadriceps (27.3%), and arthritis (35.4%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18758282|title=Long-term follow-up of tibial shaft fractures treated with intramedullary nailing|publisher=Pubmed.gov, United States National Library of Medicine|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}</ref>
