'''Trichotillomania''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|r|ɪ|k|ə|ˌ|t|ɪ|l|ə|'|m|eɪ|n|i|ə}} {{respell|TRIK|ə|TIL|ə|MAY-NEE|ə}}, also known as '''trichotillosis''') is the compulsive urge to pull out (and in some cases, eat) one's own hair leading to noticeable hair loss, distress, and social or functional impairment. It is classified as an [[impulse control disorder]] by [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] and is often chronic and difficult to treat.<ref name="Chamberlain"/>

Trichotillomania may be present in infants, but the peak age of onset is 9 to 13. It may be triggered by depression or stress. Due to social implications the disorder is often unreported and it is difficult to accurately predict its [[prevalence]]; the lifetime prevalence is estimated to be between 0.6% (overall) and may be as high as 1.5% (in males) to 3.4% (in females). Common areas for hair to be pulled out are the scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows, arms, hands, and pubic hairs.

The name, coined by French dermatologist [[François Henri Hallopeau]], derives from the Greek: ''trich-'' (hair), ''till(en)'' (to pull), and ''[[mania]]'' ("madness, frenzy").<ref name="Salaam"/>

== Classification ==
Trichotillomania is defined as a self-induced and recurrent loss of hair.<ref name="Sah"/>  It includes the criterion of an increasing sense of tension before pulling the hair and gratification or relief when pulling the hair.<ref name="Chamberlain"/>  However, some people with trichotillomania do not endorse the inclusion of "rising tension and subsequent pleasure, gratification, or relief" as part of the criteria;<ref name="Chamberlain">{{cite journal |author=Chamberlain SR, Menzies L, Sahakian BJ, Fineberg NA |title=Lifting the veil on trichotillomania |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=4 |pages=568–74 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17403968 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.164.4.568 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/164/4/568}}</ref>  because many individuals with trichotillomania may not realize they are pulling their hair, patients presenting for diagnosis may deny the criteria for tension prior to hair pulling or a sense of gratification after hair is pulled.<ref name="Sah"/>

Trichotillomania may lie on the [[obsessive-compulsive spectrum]], also encompassing [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], nail biting ([[onychophagia]]) and skin picking ([[dermatillomania]]), [[tic disorder]]s and [[eating disorder]]s. These conditions may share clinical features, genetic contributions, and possibly treatment response; however, differences between trichotillomania and OCD are present in symptoms, neural function and cognitive profile.<ref name="Chamberlain"/>  In the sense that it is associated with irresistible urges to perform unwanted repetitive behavior, trichotillomania is akin to some of these conditions, and rates of trichotillomania among relatives of OCD patients is higher than expected by chance.<ref name="Chamberlain"/>  However, differences between the disorder and OCD have been noted, including: differing peak ages at onset, rates of [[comorbid]]ity, gender differences, and neural dysfunction and cognitive profile.<ref name="Chamberlain"/>  When it occurs in early childhood, it can be regarded as a distinct clinical entity.<ref name="Chamberlain"/>

Because trichotillomania can be present in multiple age groups, it is helpful in terms of prognosis and treatment to approach three distinct subgroups by age: preschool age children, preadolescents to young adults, and adults.<ref name="Sah"/>

Trichotillomania is often not a focused act, but rather hair pulling occurs in a "trance-like" state;<ref name="Tay">{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.113.5.e494 |author=Tay YK, Levy ML, Metry DW |title=Trichotillomania in childhood: case series and review |journal=Pediatrics |volume=113 |issue=5 |pages=e494–8 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid= 15121993|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/113/5/e494}}</ref> hence, trichotillomania is subdivided into "automatic" versus "focused" hair pulling.<ref name="Sah"/> Children are more often in the automatic, or unconscious, subtype and may not consciously remember pulling their hair.  Other individuals may have focused, or conscious, rituals associated with hair pulling, including seeking specific types of hairs to pull, pulling until the hair feels "just right", or pulling in response to a specific sensation.<ref name="Sah"/>  Knowledge of the subtype is helpful in determining treatment strategies.<ref name="Sah"/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Trichotillomania is usually confined to one or two sites,<ref name="Chamberlain"/> but can involve multiple sites. The scalp is the most common pulling site, followed by the eyebrows, eyelashes, face, arms, and legs.<ref name="Sah"/> Some less common areas include the pubic area, underarms, beard, and chest. <ref >TLC. "What is Compulsive Hair Pulling" http://www.trich.org/about/hair-pulling.html. 2012</ref> The classic presentation is the "[[Friar Tuck]]" form of vertex and crown alopecia.<ref>{{cite book|author= James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk |year= 2005 |title= Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |edition= 10th |publisher= Saunders |isbn= 0-7216-2921-0 |page=62}}</ref>  Children are less likely to pull from areas other than the scalp.<ref name="Sah"/>

People who suffer from trichotillomania often pull only one hair at a time and these hair pull episodes can last for hours at a time. Trichotillomania can go into relapse-like states where the individual may not experience the urge to "pull" for days, weeks, months, and even years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pullfreeatlast.com/trichotillomania-facts/trichotillomania-information.html |title=Trichotillomania: 12 Facts You Should Know About Trich |publisher=Pullfreeatlast.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref>

Individuals with trichotillomania exhibit hair of differing lengths; some are broken hairs with blunt ends, some new growth with tapered ends, some broken mid-shaft, or some uneven stubble.  Scaling on the scalp is not present, overall hair density is normal, and a hair pull test is negative (the hair does not pull out easily).  Hair is often pulled out leaving an unusual shape. Individuals with trichotillomania may be secretive or shameful of the hair pulling behavior.<ref name="Sah"/>

An additional psychological effect can be low [[self-esteem]], often associated with being shunned by peers and the fear of socializing due to appearance and negative attention they may receive.  Some people with trichotillomania wear hats, wigs, false eyelashes, eyebrow pencil, or style their hair in an effort to avoid such attention. There seems to be a strong [[Stress (biological)|stress]]-related component. In low-stress environments, some exhibit no symptoms (known as "pulling") whatsoever. This "pulling" often resumes upon leaving this environment.<ref name="Christenson91">{{cite journal |author=Christenson GA, Mackenzie TB, Mitchell JE |title=Characteristics of 60 adult chronic hair pullers |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=148 |issue=3 |pages=365–70 |year=1991 |pmid=1992841}}</ref> Some individuals with trichotillomania may feel they are the only person with this problem due to low rates of reporting.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Christenson GA, MacKenzie TB, Mitchell JE |title=Adult men and women with trichotillomania.

Other medical complications include infection, permanent loss of hair, [[repetitive stress injury]], [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], and gastrointestinal obstruction as a result of [[trichophagia]].<ref name="Chamberlain"/> In trichophagia, people with trichotillomania also ingest the hair that they pull; in extreme (and rare) cases this can lead to a hair ball ([[trichobezoar]]).<ref name="Sah"/> [[Rapunzel syndrome]], an extreme form of trichobezoar in which the "tail" of the hair ball extends into the intestines, can be fatal if misdiagnosed.<ref name="Sah"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ventura DE, Herbella FA, Schettini ST, Delmonte C |title=Rapunzel syndrome with a fatal outcome in a neglected child |journal=J.

Environment is a large factor which affects hair pulling.<ref name="Tay"/> Sedentary activities such as being in a relaxed environment are conducive to hair pulling.<ref name="Tay"/><ref name="Diefenbach">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0005-7967(02)00006-2 |author=Diefenbach GJ, Mouton-Odum S, Stanley MA |title=Affective correlates of trichotillomania |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=1305–15 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12384325}}</ref> A common example of a sedentary activity promoting hair pulling is lying in a bed while trying to rest or fall asleep.<ref name="Tay"/> An extreme example of automatic trichotillomania is found when some patients have been observed to pull their hair out while asleep.<ref name="Tay"/> This is called sleep-isolated trichotillomania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trichotillomania.co.uk/_working/about.html |accessdate=August 20, 2010|title=What is Trichotillomania?}}</ref>

== Causes and pathophysiology ==
[[Anxiety]], [[clinical depression|depression]] and obsessive–compulsive disorder are more frequently encountered in people with trichotillomania.<ref name="Chamberlain"/><ref name="pmid8698680">{{cite journal |author=Christenson GA, Crow SJ |title=The characterization and treatment of trichotillomania |journal=The Journal of clinical psychiatry |volume=57 Suppl 8 |pages=42–7; discussion 48–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8698680 }}</ref> Trichotillomania has a high overlap with [[post traumatic stress disorder]], and some cases of trichotillomania may be triggered by stress. Another school of thought emphasizes hair pulling as addictive or positively reinforcing as it is associated with rising tension beforehand and relief afterward.<ref name="Chamberlain"/> A neurocognitive model — the notion that the [[basal ganglia]] plays a role in habit formation and that the [[frontal lobe]]s are critical for normally suppressing or inhibiting such habits —sees trichotillomania as a habit disorder.<ref name="Chamberlain"/>

Abnormalities in the [[caudate nucleus]] are noted in OCD, but there is no evidence to support that these abnormalities can also be linked to trichotillomania.<ref name="Chamberlain"/> One study has shown that individuals with trichotillomania have decreased [[cerebellum|cerebellar]] volume.<ref name="Chamberlain"/><ref name="pmid16945351">{{cite journal
|author=Keuthen NJ, Makris N, Schlerf JE, ''et al.'' |title=Evidence for reduced cerebellar volumes in trichotillomania |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=374–81 |year=2007 |pmid=16945351 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.06.013}}</ref> These findings suggest some differences between OCD and trichotillomania.<ref name="Chamberlain"/> There is a lack of structural [[MRI]] studies on trichotillomania.<ref name="Chamberlain"/> In several MRI studies that have been conducted, it has been found that people with trichotillomania have more [[gray matter]] in their brains than those who do not suffer from the disorder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/193/3/216.full |title=Grey matter abnormalities in trichotillomania: morphometric magnetic resonance imaging study |publisher=Bjp.rcpsych.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref>

It is likely that multiple genes confer vulnerability to trichotillomania.<ref name="Chamberlain"/> One study identified mutations in the [[SLITRK1]] gene,<ref name="Chamberlain"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Zuchner S, Cuccaro ML, Tran-Viet KN, ''et al.'' |title=SLITRK1 mutations in trichotillomania |journal=Mol. Psychiatry |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=887–9 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17003809 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001865 |laysource=BBC News |laysummary= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5381232.stm | laydate=September 29, 2006}}</ref> another identified differences in the [[5-HT2A receptor|serotonin 2A receptor genes]],<ref name="Chamberlain"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hemmings SM, Kinnear CJ, Lochner C, ''et al.'' |title=Genetic correlates in trichotillomania--A case-control association study in the South African Caucasian population |journal=Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=93–101 |year=2006 |pmid=16910371}}</ref> and mice with a mutation on the [[HOXB8]] gene showed abnormal behaviors including hair pulling. These data are preliminary, but could indicate a genetic component in trichotillomania.<ref name="Chamberlain"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00564-5 |author=Greer JM, Capecchi MR |title=Hoxb8 is required for normal grooming behavior in mice |journal=Neuron |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=23–34 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11779477}}</ref> The more research that surrounds this relatively newly understood phenomenon, the closer that experts come to determining whether or not it is indeed gene linked.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYJyWrg-YV0&feature=related ]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref>

== Diagnosis and screening ==
Patients may be ashamed or actively attempt to disguise their symptoms. This can make diagnosis difficult as symptoms are not always immediately obvious, or have been deliberately hidden to avoid disclosure.<ref name="Chamberlain"/>  If the patient admits to hair pulling, diagnosis is not difficult; if patients deny hair pulling, a [[differential diagnosis]] must be pursued.<ref name="Sah"/>  The differential diagnosis will include evaluation for [[alopecia areata]], [[tinea capitis]], [[traction alopecia]], and [[loose anagen syndrome]].<ref name="Sah"/>  In trichotillomania, a hair pull test is negative.<ref name="Sah"/>

A [[biopsy]] can be performed and may be helpful; it reveals traumatized hair follicles with perifollicular hemorrhage, fragmented hair in the dermis, empty follicles, and deformed hair shafts (trichomalacia).  Multiple [[catagen]] hairs are typically seen.  An alternative technique to biopsy, particularly for children, is to shave a part of the involved area and observe for regrowth of normal hairs.<ref>{{cite book|author= James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk |year= 2005 |title= Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |edition= 10th |publisher= Saunders |isbn= 0-7216-2921-0 |page=63}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment is based on a person's age.  Most pre-school age children outgrow it if the condition is managed conservatively.  In young adults, establishing the diagnosis and raising awareness of the condition is an important reassurance for the family and patient.  Non-pharmacological interventions, including [[behavior modification]] programs, may be considered; referrals to psychologists or psychiatrists are considered when other interventions fail.  When trichotillomania begins in adulthood, it is often associated with other psychiatric disorders, and referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist for evaluation or treatment is considered best.  The hair pulling may resolve when other conditions are treated.<ref name="Sah"/>

===Psychosocial===
[[Habit Reversal Training]] (HRT) has the highest rate of success in treating trichotillomania.<ref name="Sah"/>  HRT has been shown to be a successful adjunct to [[medication]] as a way to treat trichotillomania.<ref name="Chamberlain"/><ref name="Woods">{{cite journal |author=Woods DW, Wetterneck CT, Flessner CA |title=A controlled evaluation of acceptance and commitment therapy plus habit reversal for trichotillomania |journal=Behaviour research and therapy |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=639–56 |year=2006 |pmid=16039603 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2005.05.006}}</ref>  With HRT, doctors train the individual to learn to recognize their impulse to pull and also teach them to redirect this impulse.  In comparisons of behavioral versus pharmacologic treatment, [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (including HRT) have shown significant improvement over medication alone.<ref name="Chamberlain"/><ref name="Sah"/> It has also proven effective in treating children.<ref name="Sah"/> [[Biofeedback]], cognitive-behavioral methods, and [[hypnosis]] may improve symptoms.<ref name="Shenefelt2003">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8019.2003.01620.x |author=Shenefelt PD |title=Biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral methods, and hypnosis in dermatology: is it all in your mind? |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=114–22 |year=2003 |pmid=12919113}}</ref>

===Medication===
Medications can be used to treat trichotillomania. Treatment with [[clomipramine]] (Anafranil), a [[tricyclic antidepressant]], was shown in a small [[Blind experiment|double-blind study]] to significantly improve symptoms,<ref name="Swedo">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198908243210803 |author=Swedo SE, Leonard HL, Rapoport JL, Lenane MC, Goldberger EL, Cheslow DL |title=A double-blind comparison of clomipramine and desipramine in the treatment of trichotillomania (hair pulling) |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=321 |issue=8 |pages=497–501 |year=1989 |pmid=2761586 }}</ref> but results of other studies on clomipramine for treating trichotillomania have been inconsistent.<ref name="Sah"/> [[Fluoxetine]] (Prozac) and other [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) have limited usefulness in treating trichotillomania, and can often have significant side effects.<ref name=Christenson91a>{{cite journal |author=Christenson GA, Mackenzie TB, Mitchell JE, Callies AL |title=A placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study of fluoxetine in trichotillomania |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=148 |issue=11 |pages=1566–71 |year=1991 |month=November |pmid=1928474 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1928474}}</ref>  Behavioral therapy has proven more effective when compared to fluoxetine or control groups.<ref name="Sah"/>  Dual treatment (behavioral therapy and medication) may provide an advantage in some cases, but robust evidence from [[Evidence-based medicine#Qualification of evidence|high-quality studies]] is lacking.<ref name="Chamberlain"/> [[Acetylcysteine]] treatment stemmed from an understanding of glutamate's role in regulation of impulse control.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grant |first1=J. E. |last2=Odlaug |first2=B. L. |last3=Won Kim |first3=S. |title=N-Acetylcysteine, a Glutamate Modulator, in the Treatment of Trichotillomania: A Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Study |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=7 |pages=756–63 |year=2009 |pmid=19581567 |doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.60}}</ref>

Many medications, depending on individuality, may increase hair pulling.

== Prognosis ==
When it occurs in early childhood (before five years of age), the condition is typically self-limiting and intervention is not required.<ref name="Chamberlain"/>  In adults, the onset of trichotillomania may be secondary to underlying psychiatric disturbances and symptoms are generally more long-term.<ref name="Sah"/>

Secondary infections may occur due to picking and scratching, but other complications are rare.<ref name="Sah"/>  Individuals with trichotillomania often find that support groups are helpful in living with and overcoming the disorder.<ref name="Sah"/>

==Epidemiology==
Although no [[Population study|broad-based population]] [[epidemiology|epidemiologic studies]] had been conducted as of 2009, the lifetime [[prevalence]] of trichotillomania is estimated to be between 0.6% (overall) and as high as 1.5% (in males) to 3.4% (in females).<ref name="Christenson91"/> With a 1% prevalence rate, 2.5 million people in the U.S. may have trichotillomania at some time during their lifetimes.<ref name="Diefenbach">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(98)00083-X |author=Diefenbach GJ, Reitman D, Williamson DA |title=Trichotillomania: a challenge to research and practice |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=289–309 |year=2000 |month=April |pmid=10779896 }}</ref>

According to the [[Office of Rare Diseases]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] trichotillomania is considered a rare disease which, according to their statistics, means that less than 200,000 people in the United States are affected by this disorder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/t/trichotillomania/prevalence.htm |title=Prevalence and Incidence of Trichotillomania |publisher=RightDiagnosis.com |date=2013-02-12 |accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref>

Trichotillomania is diagnosed in all age groups; onset is more common during preadolescence and young adulthood, with mean age of onset between 9 and 13 years of age,<ref name="Sah">{{cite journal |author=Sah DE, Koo J, Price VH |title=Trichotillomania |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=13–21 |year=2008 |pmid=18318881 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8019.2008.00165.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119418689/PDFSTART|format=PDF}}</ref> and a notable peak at 12–13.<ref name="Chamberlain"/>  Among preschool children the genders are equally represented; there appears to be a female predominance among preadolescents to young adults, with between 70% and 93% of patients being female.<ref name="Sah"/>  Among adults, females typically outnumber males by 3 to 1.<ref name="Chamberlain"/>

"Automatic" pulling occurs in approximately three-quarters of adult patients with trichotillomania.<ref name="Sah"/>

== History ==
Hair pulling was first described in the literature in 1885,<ref name="Salaam">{{cite journal |author=Salaam K, Carr J, Grewal H, Sholevar E, Baron D |title=Untreated trichotillomania and trichophagia: surgical emergency in a teenage girl |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=362–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16000680 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.46.4.362 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/46/4/362}}</ref> and the term ''trichotillomania'' was coined by the French dermatologist [[François Henri Hallopeau]] in 1889.<ref name="Chamberlain"/><ref name="Salaam"/>

It was not until 1987 that trichotillomania was recognized in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, third edition-revised (DSM-III-R).<ref>http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/60/5/658.full.pdf</ref>
