'''Chloropicrin''', also known as '''PS''', is a [[chemical compound]] with the structural formula Cl<sub>3</sub>CNO<sub>2</sub>. This colourless highly toxic liquid was once used in [[chemical warfare]] and is currently used as a [[fumigant]] and [[nematicide]] as a stand alone treatment or in combination / co-formulation with methyl bromide and 1,3-Dichloropropene.<ref name="fumigant">http://www.workcover.nsw.gov.au/Documents/Publications/AlertsGuidesHazards/DangerousGoodsExplosivesFireworksPyrotechnics/chloropicrin_fact_sheet_1371.pdf {{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref><ref name="google">{{cite book| author = Amos Alfred Fries| coauthors = Clarence Jay West| title = Chemical warfare| url = http://books.google.com/?id=cTA6AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA144| year = 1921| publisher = McGraw-Hill book company, inc.| isbn = | page = 144 }}</ref>

==History==
Chloropicrin was first discovered in 1848 by a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] chemist [[John Stenhouse]]. He prepared it by the reaction of a [[Chlorine|chlorinating agent]] with [[picric acid]]:<!--eq is an approx guess-->
:HOC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 11 NaOCl → 3 Cl<sub>3</sub>CNO<sub>2</sub> + 3 Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 3 NaOH + 2 NaCl
Because of the precursor he used, Stenhouse named the compound chloropicrin, although the two compounds are structurally dissimilar.

Chloropicrin was used famously in [[World War I]]. In 1917, there were reports that the Germans were testing and using a new chemical in warfare.<ref name="google"/> That chemical was chloropicrin. While not as lethal as other chemical weapons, it caused [[vomiting]] and was a [[lachrymatory agent]].<ref name="google"/> This combination of properties forced Allied soldiers to remove their masks to vomit, exposing them to toxic gases.<ref name="google"/> This caused a large number of casualties on the Italian front.<ref name="google"/>

==Preparation==
Chloropicrin is manufactured by the reaction of [[nitromethane]] with [[sodium hypochlorite]]:<ref>Sheldon B. Markofsky "Nitro Compounds, Aliphatic" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005.</ref>
:H<sub>3</sub>CNO<sub>2</sub> + 3 NaOCl → Cl<sub>3</sub>CNO<sub>2</sub> + 3 NaOH

==Properties==
As listed in the Table, chloropicrin is a colorless liquid that is insoluble in water, with which it is stable. With a vapor pressure of 24&nbsp;mm Hg, its volatility is between that of [[phosgene]] and [[mustard gas]] in persistency, although closer to phosgene because it is related to the compound.<ref name="google"/> Tests have shown that chloropicrin causes humans to shut their eyes involuntarily.<ref name="google"/> Chloropicrin can be absorbed systemically through inhalation, ingestion, and the skin. It is severely irritating to the lungs, eyes, and skin.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/EmergencyResponseCard_29750034.html Chloropicrin (PS): Lung Damaging Agent]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Emergency Response Safety and Health Database, August 22, 2008. Retrieved December 23, 2008.</ref> Because of these properties, chloropicrin can only be delivered in shell form as a chemical weapon.<ref name="google" />

==Application==
[[File:Chlorpicrin ww2 poster.jpg|left|thumb|US Army poster from World War II.]]
Chloropicrin, today, is used as a fumigant to control pests found in the soil.<ref name="fumigant"/> Although less common, it can be used as a poison for vertebrates, such as rabbits.<ref name="fumigant"/> Chloropicrin is commonly used in combination with other fumigants, such as [[methyl bromide]] and [[sulfuryl fluoride]], for increased potency and as a warning agent.<ref name="fumigant"/>

Chloropicrin has been used in [[chemical warfare]]. It first appeared in 1917 when the Germans tested a new chemical weapon on the Italian front.<ref name="google"/> The new chemical weapon was devastating to the Allies at first, since they had never encountered it before.

==Safety==
Chloropicrin is a highly toxic chemical:
NIOSH 1995 states that:
* Chloropicrin is a lachrymator and a severe irritant of the respiratory system in humans; it also causes severe skin irritation on contact. When splashed onto the eye chloropicrin has caused corneal [[edema]] and liquification of the [[cornea]].
* Exposure to concentrations of 15 ppm cannot be tolerated for more than 1&nbsp;minute, and exposure to 4 ppm for a few seconds is temporarily disabling.
* Exposure to 0.3-0.37 ppm chloropicrin for 3 to 30&nbsp;seconds causes tearing and eye pain. Exposure to 15 ppm for a few seconds can cause respiratory tract injury.
* Exposure to 119 ppm in air for 30&nbsp;minutes is lethal; death is caused by pulmonary edema.

Examples of industrial exposure in humans: 27 workers in a cellulose factory who were exposed to high levels of chloropicrin for 3&nbsp;minutes developed [[pneumonitis]] after 3 to 12 hours of irritated coughing and difficulty on breathing; they subsequently developed pulmonary edema, and one died.

EU classification of chloropicrin is:
R22 Harmful if swallowed, R26 Very toxic by inhalation, R36/37/38 Irritating to eyes, skin and respiratory system, R43 May cause sensitisation by skin contact, R50/53 Very toxic to aquatic organisms, may cause long term adverse effects in the aquatic environment.

Because of chloropicrin's stability, protection requires highly effective absorbents, such as [[activated charcoal]].<ref name="google"/> Chloropicrin, unlike its relative compound [[phosgene]], is absorbed readily at any temperature, which may pose a threat in low or high temperature climates.<ref name="google" />

The use of the substance has been restricted by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], although such restriction is outdated now.<ref name="rupr">{{cite web

==Portrayal in media==
In the 1987 Movie [[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]], detectives Joe Friday ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) and Pep Streebeck ([[Tom Hanks]]) thwart an attempt by mad cultists to release a tanker truck of trichloronitromethane at a party attended by several prominent Los Angeles city officials.

The effects cited in explaining the substance (vomiting, suffocation, and death) are consistent with the actual chemical.
