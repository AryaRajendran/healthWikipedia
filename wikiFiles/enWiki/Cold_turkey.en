"'''Cold turkey'''" describes the actions of a person who abruptly gives up a habit or [[Substance dependence|addiction]] rather than gradually easing the process through gradual reduction or by using replacement [[medication]].

The supposed advantage is that by not actively using supplemental methods, the person avoids thinking about the habit and its temptation, and avoids further feeding the chemical addiction. The supposed disadvantages related to the abuse of drugs such as [[alcohol]], [[benzodiazepines]], and [[heroin]] are unbearable [[withdrawal]] symptoms from the total absence, which may cause tremendous stress on the heart and blood vessels (and, in a worst case scenario, death<ref> All About Addiction by Adi Jaffe, Ph.D. (http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-addiction/201001/alcohol-benzos-and-opiates-withdrawal-might-kill-you)</ref>).

Sudden [[withdrawal]] from drugs such as [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[benzodiazepines]] and [[barbiturate]]s can be extremely dangerous, leading to potentially fatal seizures. In long-term [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]], going cold turkey can cause life-threatening [[delirium tremens]] and thus is not an appropriate method for breaking an alcohol addiction.<ref name="hughes">{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=John R. |title=Alcohol withdrawal seizures |journal=Epilepsy & Behavior |volume=15 |pages=92–7 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.02.037 |pmid=19249388 |issue=2}}</ref>

In the case of dependence upon certain drugs, including opiates such as heroin, going cold turkey may be extremely unpleasant, but less dangerous.<ref name="nih">[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000949.htm] Opiate withdrawal: Medline Plus&nbsp;— NIH.</ref> Life-threatening issues are unlikely without a pre-existing medical condition.

The phrase's use in popular culture includes [[John Lennon]]'s song "[[Cold Turkey]]", about kicking heroin, and [[Norman Lear]]'s [[1971 in cinema|1971]] movie ''[[Cold Turkey (film)|Cold Turkey]]'', about a small town that gives up smoking to win $25,000,000.

==Etymology==
An early printed use of the word in the mainstream media to refer to drug withdrawal occurred in a February 26, 1951 [[Time Magazine]] article "High & Light": "There is one dimly hopeful side to the teen-age dope problem. Unlike older people, few teen-agers appear to take to drugs because of psychological troubles; youngsters usually start using narcotics either out of ignorance or the same reckless impulses which lead them to race hot rods. Though they are easier to wean, however, there are almost no facilities for taking care of them. On New York's [[Rikers Island]], youngsters have to endure the horrors of a sudden '''"cold turkey"''' cure or get none at all. Once released, many go right back to drugs again." It had been previously used in this sense by Mickey Spillane in his novel "I, the Jury": "Included was a medical record from the hospital when he had made her go cold turkey, which is dope-addict talk for an all-out cure."

There are several explanations of the phrase's origin:
* A narrowing of the meaning "suddenly or without preparation," from cold turkey being a dish that requires little preparation; originally used for heroin addicts.<ref name="etymoline">[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cold+turkey] ''Cold turkey'' in the Online Etymology Dictionary</ref>
* From the American phrase ''talk turkey'' meaning "to speak bluntly with little preparation".<ref name="dictionary">[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cold+turkey] cold turkey definition</ref>
* Some believe the derivation is from the comparison of a cold [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] carcass and the state of a withdrawing addict — most notably, the [[cold sweats]], [[goose bumps]].<ref>http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/96950.html</ref>
* Reference to the periods after Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays where cold (leftover) turkey was likely to be eaten, coinciding with the end of those holidays' characteristically high alcohol consumption.<ref>http://www.proverbium.org/idioms/cold-turkey/</ref><!-- {Trish Moore PhD,M.S Stokes MD,Dr.T.Aldworth =December 2010}-->
