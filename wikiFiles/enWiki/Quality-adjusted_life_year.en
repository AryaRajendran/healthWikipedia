The '''quality-adjusted life year''' (QALY) is a measure of [[disease burden]], including both the quality and the quantity of life lived.<ref>[http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence - Measuring effectiveness and cost effectiveness: the QALY]</ref><ref>[http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/glossary/QALY.html Bandolier - QALY]</ref> It is used in assessing the value for money of a [[medical]] intervention. The QALY model requires [[utility|utility independent]], [[risk neutral]], and constant proportional tradeoff behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=206–24 |doi=10.1287/opre.28.1.206 |jstor=172147 |title=Utility Functions for Life Years and Health Status |year=1980 |last1=Pliskin |first1=J.

The QALY is based on the number of years of life that would be added by the intervention. Each year in perfect health is assigned the value of 1.0 down to a value of 0.0 for being dead. If the extra years would not be lived in full health, for example if the  patient would lose a limb, or be blind or have to use a [[wheelchair]], then the extra life-years are given a value between 0 and 1 to account for this.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Under certain methods, such as the [[EQ-5D]], QALY can be negative number.

==Use==
The QALY is often used in [[cost-utility analysis]] to calculate the ratio of cost to QALYs saved for a particular health care intervention. This is then used to allocate [[Health care|healthcare]] resources, with an intervention with a lower cost to QALY saved (incremental cost effectiveness) ratio ("ICER") being preferred over an intervention with a higher ratio.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Calculation==

The QALY is a measure of the value of health outcomes. Since health is a function of length of life and quality of life, the QALY was developed as an attempt to combine the value of these attributes into a single index number. The basic idea underlying the QALY is simple: it assumes that a year of life lived in perfect health is worth 1 QALY (1 Year of Life × 1 Utility value = 1 QALY) and that a year of life lived in a state of less than this perfect health is worth less than 1. In order to determine the exact QALY value, it is sufficient to multiply the [[utility]] value associated with a given state of health by the years lived in that state. QALYs are therefore expressed in terms of "years lived in perfect health": half a year lived in perfect health is equivalent to 0.5 QALYs (0.5 years × 1 Utility), the same as 1 year of life lived in a situation with utility 0.5 (e.g. bedridden) (1 year × 0.5 Utility). QALYs can then be incorporated with medical costs to arrive at a final common denominator of cost/QALY. This parameter can be used to develop a [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] of any treatment. Nevertheless, a salient problem of the QALY calculation relies on the numerical nature of its constituent parts. The appropriateness of the QALY arithmetical operation is compromised by the essence of the utility scale: while life-years are expressed in a ratio scale with a true zero, the utility is an interval scale where 0 is an arbitrary value for being dead. In order to be able to obtain coherent results, both scales would have to be expressed in the same units of measurement. The different nature of these two factors jeopardises the meaning and interpretation of QALYs. A simple general linear transformation of the utility scale suffices to demonstrate that the results of the multiplication are not invariant. Mathematically, the solution to these limitations happens through an alternative calculation of QALYs by means of operations with [[complex numbers]] rooted in the well known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. <ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Weighting==
The "weight" values between 0 and 1 are usually determined by methods such as:{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
*[[Time-trade-off]] (TTO): Respondents are asked to choose between remaining in a state of ill health for a period of time, or being restored to perfect health but having a shorter life expectancy.
*Standard gamble (SG): Respondents are asked to choose between remaining in a state of ill health for a period of time, or choosing a medical intervention which has a chance of either restoring them to perfect health, or killing them.
*[[Visual analogue scale]] (VAS): Respondents are asked to rate a state of ill health on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 representing being dead and 100 representing perfect health. This method has the advantage of being the easiest to ask, but is the most subjective.

Another way of determining the weight associated with a particular health state is to use standard descriptive systems such as the [[EuroQol Group]]'s [[EQ5D]] questionnaire, which categorises health states according to the following dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities (e.g. work, study, homework or leisure activities), pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

However, the weight assigned to a particular condition can vary greatly, depending on the population being surveyed. Those who do not suffer from the affliction in question will, on average, overestimate the detrimental effect on quality of life, compared to those who are afflicted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Debate==
The method of ranking interventions on grounds of their cost per QALY gained ratio (or ICER) is controversial because it implies a quasi-[[utilitarian]] calculus to determine who will or will not receive treatment.<ref>{{cite| first = Michael | last = Schlander | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = "Measures of efficiency in healthcare: QALMs about QALYs?" | booktitle = | pages = | publisher = [http://innoval-hc.com Institute for Innovation & Valuation in Health Care] | date = 2010-05-23 | location = | url = http://www.michaelschlander.com/pnp/publications_en/Schlander-QALMs-about-QALYs-2010.pdf | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref> However, its supporters argue that since health care resources are inevitably limited, this method enables them to be allocated in the way that is approximately optimal for society, including most patients.  Another concern is that it does not take into account equity issues such as the overall distribution of health states.  Also, many would argue that all else being equal, patients with more severe illness should be prioritised over patients with less severe illness if both would get the same absolute increase in utility.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1050(199902)8:1<25::AID-HEC398>3.0.CO;2-H |title=Incorporating societal concerns for fairness in numerical valuations of health programmes |year=1999 |last1=Nord |first1=Erik |last2=Pinto |first2=Jose Luis |last3=Richardson |first3=Jeff |last4=Menzel |first4=Paul |last5=Ubel |first5=Peter |journal=Health Economics |volume=8 |pages=25–39 |pmid=10082141 |issue=1}}</ref>

QALYs were invented by two health economists in 1956: Christopher Cundell and Carlos McCartney.<ref>http://www.medfak.ni.ac.rs/Acta%20facultatis/2011/4-2011/1.pdf</ref>
