'''Neuroprotection''' is a widely explored treatment option for many [[central nervous system]] (CNS) disorders including [[neurodegenerative diseases]], [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], and [[spinal cord injury]]. Neuroprotection aims to prevent or slow disease progression and secondary injuries by halting or at least slowing the loss of [[neurons]].<ref name="overview of PD">{{cite journal | author = Seidl SE, Potashkin JA | title = The promise of neuroprotective agents in Parkinson's disease | journal = Front Neurol | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 68 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22125548 | pmc = 3221408 | doi = 10.3389/fneur.2011.00068 }}</ref>  Despite differences in symptoms or injuries associated with [[CNS disorders]], many of the mechanisms behind neurodegeneration are the same.  Common mechanisms include increased levels in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, inflammatory changes, iron accumulation, and protein aggregation.<ref name="overview of PD"/><ref name="prospects">{{cite journal | author = Dunnett SB, Björklund A | title = Prospects for new restorative and neuroprotective treatments in Parkinson's disease | journal = Nature | volume = 399 | issue = 6738 Suppl | pages = A32–9 | year = 1999 | month = June | pmid = 10392578 | doi =  }}</ref><ref name="oxidative stress">{{cite journal | author = Andersen JK | title = Oxidative stress in neurodegeneration: cause or consequence? | journal = Nat.

Not only can oxidative stress and excitotoxicity trigger neuron cell death but when combined they have synergistic effects that cause even more degradation than on their own.<ref name="inflammation">{{cite journal | author = Zádori D, Klivényi P, Szalárdy L, Fülöp F, Toldi J, Vécsei L | title = Mitochondrial disturbances, excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation and kynurenines: Novel therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders | journal = J Neurol Sci | volume = 322| issue = 1-2| pages = 187–91| year = 2012 | month = June | pmid = 22749004 | doi = 10.1016/j.jns.2012.06.004 }}</ref>  Thus limiting excitotoxicity and oxidative stress is a very important aspect of neuroprotection.  Common neuroprotective treatments are glutamate antagonists and antioxidants, which aim to limit excitotoxicity and oxidative stress respectively.

== Excitotoxicity ==
{{main|Excitotoxicity}}
Glutamate excitotoxicity is one of the most important mechanisms known to trigger cell death in [[CNS disorders]].   Over-excitation of [[glutamate receptors]], specifically [[NMDA receptor]]s, allows for an increase in [[calcium]] ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) influx due to the lack of specificity in the ion channel opened upon glutamate binding.<ref name="inflammation"/><ref name="excitotoxicity">{{cite journal | author = Zhang C, Du F, Shi M, Ye R, Cheng H, Han J, Ma L, Cao R, Rao Z, Zhao G | title = Ginsenoside Rd protects neurons against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity by inhibiting ca(2+) influx | journal = Cell.

=== Glutamate antagonists ===
Glutamate antagonists are the primary treatment used to prevent or help control excitotoxicity in CNS disorders.  The goal of these antagonists is to inhibit the binding of glutamate to [[NMDA receptor]]s such that accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and therefore excitotoxicity can be avoided.  Use of glutamate antagonists presents a huge obstacle in that the treatment much overcome selectivity such that binding is only inhibited when excitotoxicity is present.  A number of glutamate antagonists have been explored as options in CNS disorders, but many are found to lack efficacy or have intolerable side effects.  Glutamate antagonists are a hot topic of research.  Below are some of the treatments that have promising results for the future:
*Estrogen: [[Estradiol|17β-Estradiol]] helps regulate excitotoxicity by inhibiting NMDA receptors as well as other glutamate receptors.<ref name="excitotoxic estrogen">{{cite journal | author = Liu SB, Zhang N, Guo YY, Zhao R, Shi TY, Feng SF, Wang SQ, Yang Q, Li XQ, Wu YM, Ma L, Hou Y, Xiong LZ, Zhang W, Zhao MG | title = G-protein-coupled receptor 30 mediates rapid neuroprotective effects of estrogen via depression of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors | journal = J.

*[[Ginsenoside]] Rd:  Results from the study show ginsenoside rd attenuates glutamate excitotoxicity. Importantly, clinical trials for the drug in patients with ischemic stroke show it to be effective as well as noninvasive<ref name="excitotoxicity"/>
*[[Progesterone]]: Administration of progesterone is well known to aid in the prevention of secondary injuries in patients with traumatic brain injury and stroke<ref name="progesterone"/>

== Oxidative stress ==
{{main|Oxidative stress}}
Increased levels of oxidative stress can be caused in part by neuroinflammation, which is a highly recognized part of cerebral ischemia as well as many neurodegenerative diseases including [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]].<ref name="oxidative stress"/><ref name="inflammation"/>  The increased levels of oxidative stress are widely targeted in neuroprotective treatments because of their role in causing neuron apoptosis.  Oxidative stress can directly cause neuron cell death or it can trigger a cascade of events that leads to protein misfolding, proteasomal malfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, or glial cell activation.<ref name="overview of PD"/><ref name="prospects"/><ref name="oxidative stress"/><ref name="protein misfolding">{{cite journal | author = Liu T, Bitan G | title = Modulating self-assembly of amyloidogenic proteins as a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases: strategies and mechanisms | journal = ChemMedChem | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 359–74 | year = 2012 | month = March | pmid = 22323134 | doi = 10.1002/cmdc.201100585 }}</ref>  If one of these events is triggered, further neurodegradation is caused as each of these events causes neuron cell apoptosis.<ref name="prospects"/><ref name="oxidative stress"/><ref name="protein misfolding"/>  By decreasing oxidative stress through neuroprotective treatments, further neurodegradation can be inhibited.

=== Antioxidants ===
{{main|Antioxidants}}
Antioxidants are the primary treatment used to control oxidative stress levels.  Antioxidants work to eliminate reactive oxygen species, which are the prime cause of neurodegradation.  The effectiveness of antioxidants in preventing further neurodegradation is not only disease dependent but can also depend on gender, ethnicity, and age.  Listed below are common antioxidants shown to be effective in reducing oxidative stress in at least one neurodegenerative disease:
*[[Deprenyl]]: This has been shown to slow early progression of symptoms and delayed the emergence of disability by an average of nine months.<ref name="prospects"/>
*Estrogen: [[17α-estradiol]] and [[17β-estradiol]] have been shown to be effective as antioxidants.  The potential for these drugs is enormous.  17α-estradiol is the nonestrogenic stereoisomer of 17β-estradiol.  The effectiveness of 17α-estradiol is important because it shows that the mechanism is dependent on the presence of the specific hydroxyl group, but independent of the activation of estrogen receptors.  This means more antioxidants can be developed with bulky side chains so that they don't bind to the receptor but still possess the antioxidant properties.<ref name="estrogen">{{cite journal | author = Behl C, Skutella T, Lezoualc'h F, Post A, Widmann M, Newton CJ, Holsboer F | title = Neuroprotection against oxidative stress by estrogens: structure-activity relationship | journal = Mol.

*[[Resveratrol]]: Resveratrol prevents oxidative stress by attenuating hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity and intracellular accumulation of ROS.

== Other neuroprotective treatments==
More neuroprotective treatment options exist that target different mechanisms of neurodegradation.  Continued research is being done in an effort to find any method effective in preventing the onset or progression of neurodegenerative diseases or secondary injuries.  These include:
*[[Caspase]] inhibitors: These are primarily used and studied for their anti [[apoptosis|apoptotic]] effects.<ref name="capase">{{cite journal | author = Li W, Lee MK | title = Antiapoptotic property of human alpha-synuclein in neuronal cell lines is associated with the inhibition of caspase-3 but not caspase-9 activity | journal = J.
