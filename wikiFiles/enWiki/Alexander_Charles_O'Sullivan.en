Dr. '''Alexander Charles O'Sullivan''' (1858–18 February 1924), B.A., M.B., B.Ch., B.A.O was Professor of [[Pathology]] in the [[University of Dublin]] and Senior Fellow of [[Trinity College, Dublin]].  He was born in [[County Cork]] and educated at Trinity College, later becoming a lecturer and then professor at that institution. During [[World War I]] he served in [[Malta]] with the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]].

==Early life and education==
Dr. Alex O'Sullivan was born in [[County Cork]] in May 1858, the son of the Rev. Denis Mitchell O'Sullivan, Rector of [[Macroom]], and Lucia Maria née Swete, as the oldest of four children.<ref>O'Sullivan family papers.</ref> He was educated at [[Tipperary Grammar School]] and went to [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. Having studied classics in his freshman years he suddenly turned to mathematics, and obtained a scholarship in that subject in 1879. In 1881 he was first senior moderator in mathematics and also in ethics and logic.<ref name="BMJ" />

The [[British Medical Journal]] noted that the first mathematical scholar in 1879 was Dr. Bernard, later a Provost of Trinity College, and the senior classical scholar was [[J. B. Bury|Professor J. B. Bury]], the distinguished historian; Dr. Bernard obtained his Fellowship in 1884, Dr. Bury in 1885, and Dr. O'Sullivan in 1886.<ref name="BMJ" />

Having taken his Fellowship, Dr. O'Sullivan, under the influence and advice of the late [[Samuel Haughton|Professor Samuel Haughton]], turned to the study of medicine, and took his M.B., B.Ch., B.A.O. degrees in 1894. He also took a special course of [[bacteriology]] in [[Vienna]].<ref name="BMJ" />

==Later life and career==
Returning to Dublin in 1895, Dr. O'Sullivan was appointed lecturer in [[pathology]] in Trinity College.<ref name="BMJ" /> When the chair of pathology was founded he was again reappointed as lecturer, and a couple of years ago he was confirmed in that position as professor.<ref name="BMJ" /> Dr. O'Sullivan may be regarded as the father of the modern school of Dublin physicians.<ref name="BMJ" />

Dr. O'Sullivan held examinerships in the [[University of Glasgow|Universities of Glasgow]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], and [[University of Belfast|Belfast]], and was a member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]], for which he wrote many papers.<ref name="BMJ" /> During the last three years of his life he held the position of registrar of the medical school (dean of the medical faculty).<ref name="BMJ" /> He came into contact with two generations of medical students, and helped to shape the policy of the College.<ref name="BMJ" />  In 1903 he was Vice-President of the Pathology Section at the meeting of the [[British Medical Association]] at [[Swansea]].<ref name="BMJ" />

==War record==
In the autumn of 1915 Dr. O'Sullivan volunteered for service and went out as a major in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to [[Malta]], where his work in [[malaria]] and [[dysentery]] obtained widespread recognition. He was soon promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] and became Director of Laboratories, Malta.<ref>RAMC Officers of the Malta Garrison, 1916, http://maltaramc.com/ramcoff/1910_1919/ramcoff1916.html</ref> At the close of [[World War I]] he was placed in charge of the [[Central Military Laboratory]] for Ireland.<ref name="BMJ" />

==Death==
Dr. O'Sullivan died on 18 February 1924 at his residence, Ailesbury Road, Dublin, after an illness of only a few days.<ref name="BMJ" />  The cause of his death was [[blood poisoning]] contracted on 13 February, whilst performing a [[post-mortem examination]]. He left a widow and four children.<ref name="BMJ">{{Cite wikisource|date=1924-03-01|class=journal|chapter=Obituary: Alexander Charles O'Sullivan|plaintitle=[[British Medical Journal]]|publisher=[[BMJ Group]]|location=London|page=409|wslink=British Medical Journal/1924/Alexander Charles O'Sullivan|volume=1|number=3296|scan=Page:British Medical Journal, 1924 March 1 pp409-410.djvu/1}}</ref>

==Character==
In his youth he was an accomplished athlete, and he [[Rowing (sport)|rowed]] in the College eights and fours. He was a keen [[Yachting|yachtsman]] and [[Golf|golfer]], and loved a game of [[billiards]]. The British Medical Journal's obituary described Dr. O'Sullivan as "a man of the most lovable character: with simplicity he combined manly courage, as had frequently been displayed in his [[mountaineering]] adventures."<ref name="BMJ" />

Dr. O'Sullivan was a fine classical scholar, and always kept in close touch with the progress of modern mathematics; many men holding chairs in that subject to-day would acknowledge him to be their master.  His interest in the development of mathematical research did not interfere with his devotion to philosophy and the classics, and he probably had few equals in his knowledge of cellular pathology. He was an inspiring teacher; his laboratory was a rallying point for medical students and newly qualified physicians in search of advice and guidance.<ref name="BMJ" />
