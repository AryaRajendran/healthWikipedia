'''Trans sodium crocetinate''' (TSC) is a synthetic drug that increases the movement of [[oxygen]] from [[red blood cells]] into [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] (oxygen-starved) tissues.<ref name="Gainer2008">{{cite journal |author= Gainer, J |title= Trans-sodium crocetinate for treating hypoxia/ischemia |journal= Expert Opinion in Investigational Drugs |issue=6 |pages=917–924|year=2008 | volume=17 |doi= 10.1517/13543784.17.6.917}}</ref> TSC belongs to a group of substances known as bipolar trans carotenoid salts, which constitute a subclass of [[oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound]]s.<ref name="patent1"> {{ cite patent | country = US | number = 8,206,751 | status = patent | title = New Class of Therapeutics that Enhance Small Molecule Diffusion | gdate = 2009-04-30 | inventor = Gainer J}}</ref> One of the first such compounds discovered was the naturally occurring substance [[crocetin]], the [[trans isomer]] of which forms the backbone structure of TSC.<ref name="Gainer2008" /> <ref name="patent 2">{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 6,060,511 | status = patent | title = Trans-sodium crocetinate, methods of making and methods of use thereof   | gdate = 2000-05-09 | inventor = Gainer J}}</ref>

== Invention and investigation ==
TSC was invented by American chemical engineer [[John L. Gainer]], who reacted [[saffron]] with [[sodium hydroxide]], and extracted the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of the trans crocetin [[isomer]] from the [[solution]].<ref name="patent 2"/> Gainer and colleagues subsequently investigated the effects of TSC in animal models.<ref name="patent 2"/> <ref name="Giassi">{{cite journal |author=Giassi L, et al |title= Trans-Sodium Crocetinate Restores Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, and Plasma Lactate after Hemorrhagic Shock |journal= Journal of Trauma-Injury Infection & Critical Care |issue=5 |pages=932–938 |year=2001 | pmid= 11706343 | volume=55 |doi=10.1097/00005373-200111000-00018}}</ref> They discovered that the drug could reverse the potentially fatal decrease in blood pressure produced by the loss of large volumes of blood in severe [[hemorrhage]], and thereby improve survival.<ref name="Giassi" />

Early investigations of TSC suggested that it had potential applications in [[battlefield medicine]], specifically in treatment of the many combat casualties with [[shock (circulatory)|hemorrhagic shock]].<ref name="Gainer2008"/><ref name="Giassi"/> Additional studies, carried out in animal models and in clinical trials in humans, indicated that TSC might prove beneficial in the treatment of a variety of conditions associated with [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and [[ischemia]] (a lack of oxygen reaching the tissues, usually due to a disruption in the circulatory system), including [[cancer]], [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), and [[stroke]].<ref name="Gainer2008"/> <ref name="patent1" /> <ref>{{cite journal |author= Lapchak P, |title= Efficacy and safety profile of the carotenoid trans sodium crocetinate administered to rabbits following multiple infarct ischemic strokes: A combination therapy study with tissue plasminogen activator | journal= Brain Research | pages=136–145|year=2010 | volume=1309 |doi= 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.10.067 |pmid= 19891959}}</ref> <ref name="Mohler" >{{cite journal |author=Mohler E, et al |title= Evaluation of trans sodium crocetinate on safety and exercise performance in patients with peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication |journal= Vascular Medicine  |pages=346–352 |year=2010 |  pmid= 22003000 | volume=16 |doi=10.1177/1358863X11422742 |issue=5}}</ref> <ref name="CT.GOV">{{cite web | url = http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01465347?term=tsc&rank=4 | publisher = [[ClinicalTrials.gov]] | date = November 2011 | accessdate=18 September 2012 |title = Safety and Efficacy Study of Trans Sodium Crocetinate (TSC) With Concomitant Radiation Therapy and Temozolomide in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma (GBM)}}</ref>

TSC has shown promise of effectiveness in restoring tissue oxygen levels and improving the ability to walk in a clinical trial of patients with [[peripheral artery disease]](PAD)<ref name="Mohler" /> in which reduced delivery of oxygen-rich blood to tissues can cause severe leg pain and impair mobility. The drug has also been under investigation in a clinical trial sponsored by drug developer [[Diffusion Pharmaceuticals]] for potential use as a [[radiosensitizer]], increasing the susceptibility of [[Tumor hypoxia|hypoxic cancer cells]] to [[radiation therapy]], in patients with a form of brain cancer known as [[glioblastoma]].<ref name="CT.GOV" />

==Mechanism of action==
Similar to other oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds, TSC appears to improve oxygenation in hypoxic tissues by exerting [[hydrophobic]] effects on water molecules in [[blood plasma]] and thereby increasing the [[hydrogen bonding]] between the water molecules.<ref name="Stennett"> {{cite journal |title= Trans sodium crocetinate and diffusion enhancement |journal= Physical Chemistry B  |pages=18078–18080 |year=2006 | volume=110 |author= Stennett a |first= et al |doi= 10.1021/jp064308 }} </ref> This in turn causes the overall organization of water molecules in plasma to become more structured, which facilitates the diffusion of oxygen through plasma and promotes the movement of oxygen into tissues.<ref name="Stennett" /> <ref>{{cite journal |author= Laidig, K.E., J.L.
