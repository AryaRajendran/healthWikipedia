'''Onyalai''' is a form of [[thrombocytopenia]] that affects some of the population in areas of central [[Africa]].<ref name="Onyalai">{{cite web |url=http://www.itg.be/evde/45_Haematologyp6.htm |title=Onyalai |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>&nbsp; Onyalai exhibits similarities to [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (ITP) but differs in [[pathogenesis]].&nbsp; The affected age range is from less than a year to 70 years and seems to not be gender-specific in the same manner as ITP.&nbsp; Cases generally peak between 11 and 20 years old.&nbsp; Although the cause of onyalai is not known at this time, inadequate [[nutrition]] and/or the consumption of tainted food are suspected.<ref name="Onyalai"/>

==Signs and symptoms==

Onyalai is an acute disease that results in the development of [[hematoma]] on oral [[mucous membranes]].  [[Hemorrhagic]] [[lesion]]s may develop on the skin, including on the soles of the feet.<ref name="Onyalai"/>&nbsp; The patient does not initially appear to be in distress, which may result in a delay of diagnosis.&nbsp; As the disease progresses, [[hematuria]] and [[melena]] will develop.&nbsp; [[Epistaxis]], [[petechiae]] and [[ecchymoses]] are common symptoms, as are subconjunctival bleeding and [[menorrhagia]].&nbsp; On average, bleeding will persist for approximately eight days, and may reoccur.<ref name="Onyalai"/>&nbsp; Approximately 80 percent of cases will exhibit chronic thrombocytopenia.&nbsp; Periodic episodes of acute hemorrhage are also possible and may be severe, possibly leading to [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] and [[death]].<ref name="Onyalai"/>
