'''Toxic megacolon''' (''megacolon toxicum'') is an acute form of colonic distension.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|five/000064014.htm|Toxic megacolon}}</ref> It is characterized by a very dilated [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] ([[megacolon]]), accompanied by abdominal distension ([[bloating]]), and sometimes [[fever]], [[abdominal pain]], or [[Shock (medical)|shock]].

Toxic megacolon is usually a [[Complication (medicine)|complication]] of [[inflammatory bowel disease]], such as [[ulcerative colitis]] and, more rarely, [[Crohn's disease]], and of some [[infections]] of the colon, including ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'' infections, which have led to [[pseudomembranous colitis]]. Other forms of megacolon exist and can be [[congenital]] (present since birth, such as [[Hirschsprung's disease]]). Also, it can be caused by ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''.

==Signs and symptoms==
*[[Abdominal pain]]
*[[Bloating|Abdominal bloating]]
*Abdominal tenderness
*[[Fever]]
*[[Tachycardia]] (rapid heart rate)
*[[Dehydration]]

There may be signs of [[septic shock]]. A [[physical examination]] reveals abdominal tenderness and possible loss of bowel sounds. An abdominal [[radiography]] shows colonic dilation. [[White blood cell]] count is usually elevated. Severe sepsis may present with hypothermia or [[leukopenia]].

==Treatment==

The objective of treatment is to decompress the bowel and to prevent swallowed air from further distending the bowel. If decompression is not achieved or the patient does not improve within 24 hours, a [[colectomy]] (surgical removal of all or part of the colon) is indicated. Fluid and electrolyte replacement help to prevent dehydration and shock. Use of [[corticosteroid]]s may be indicated to suppress the [[inflammation|inflammatory]] reaction in the colon if megacolon has resulted from active inflammatory bowel disease. [[Antibiotics]] may be given to prevent [[sepsis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Autenrieth DM, Baumgart DC |title=Toxic Megacolon |journal=Inflammatory Bowel Diseases |year=2011 |month=August |doi= 10.1002/ibd.21847 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ibd.21847/abstract}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
If the condition does not improve, the risk of death is significant. In case of poor response to conservative therapy, a colectomy is usually required. This may involve all or part of the colon being removed, with the resulting option of [[surgical anastomosis|anastomosis]] or [[ileostomy]]. Ileostomy carries far less risk of infection and postoperative complications because the risk of deterioration of sutures within the intestinal tract (as a result of anastomosis) is not present.  The risk of death and shock has been reported to be lower in children, but most children required colectomy in one case-control study.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benchimol EI, Turner D, Mann EH, ''et al.'' |title=Toxic megacolon in children with inflammatory bowel disease: clinical and radiographic characteristics |journal=Am.

*Perforation of the colon<ref name="pmid8282262">{{cite journal |author=Panos MZ, Wood MJ, Asquith P |title=Toxic megacolon: the knee-elbow position relieves bowel distension |journal=Gut |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=1726–7 |year=1993 |month=December |pmid=8282262 |pmc=1374472 |doi= 10.1136/gut.34.12.1726|url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8282262}}</ref>

Emergency action may be required if severe abdominal pain develops, particularly if it is accompanied by fever, rapid heart rate, tenderness when the abdomen is pressed, bloody [[diarrhea]], frequent diarrhea, or painful bowel movements.

Colonoscopy is contraindicated, as it may rupture the dilated colon resulting in peritonitis and septic shock.
