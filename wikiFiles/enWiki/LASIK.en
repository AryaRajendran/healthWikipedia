'''LASIK''' or '''Lasik''' (''[[Laser]]-Assisted [[in situ]] [[Keratomileusis]]''), commonly referred to as '''laser eye surgery''', is a type of [[refractive surgery]] for the correction of [[myopia]], [[hyperopia]], and [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]]. The LASIK surgery is performed by an [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] who uses a [[laser]] or [[microkeratome]] to reshape the eye's [[cornea]] in order to improve [[visual acuity]].<ref name="Finn">{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/medical-mystery-preparation-for-surgery-revealed-cause-of-deteriorating-eyesight/2011/11/26/gIQAwVLj4O_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Peter | last=Finn | date=20 December 2012 | title=Medical Mystery: Preparation for surgery revealed cause of deteriorating eyesight}}</ref> For most patients, LASIK provides a permanent alternative to [[eyeglasses]] or [[contact lens]]es.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/health-and-beauty/laser-eye-surgery-in-ireland/ | work=The Irish Times | title=Laser Eye Surgery | first=Stephen | last=Maguire}}</ref> Major side effects include [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halos]], starbursts, night-driving problems, [[keratoconus]] (corneal ectasia), and [[eye dryness]].<ref name="Bailey MD, Zadnik K.

LASIK is most similar to another surgical corrective procedure, [[photorefractive keratectomy]] (PRK), and both represent advances over [[radial keratotomy]] in the surgical treatment of refractive errors of vision. For patients with moderate to high [[myopia]] or thin corneas which cannot be treated with LASIK and PRK, the [[phakic intraocular lens]] is an alternative.<ref name=lovisolo>{{cite journal|last=Lovisolo|first=CF|coauthors=Reinstein, DZ|title=Phakic intraocular lenses.|journal=Survey of ophthalmology|date=2005 Nov-Dec|volume=50|issue=6|pages=549–87|pmid=16263370|doi=10.1016/j.survophthal.2005.08.011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Donald R.|coauthors=John  A.|title=Comparison of Implantable Contact Lens and Laser Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis for Moderate to High Myopia|journal=Cornea|year=2003|month=May|volume=22|issue=4|pages=324–331|pmid=12792475|accessdate=June 22, 2012|doi=10.1097/00003226-200305000-00009}}</ref>

==History==

===Barraquer's early work===
In the 1950s, the [[microkeratome]] and keratomileusis techniques were developed in [[Bogotá]], Colombia by the [[Spain|Spanish]] ophthalmologist [[Jose Barraquer]]. In his clinic, he would cut thin (one hundredth of a mm thick) flaps in the [[cornea]] to alter its shape. Barraquer also investigated how much of the cornea had to be left unaltered in order to provide stable long-term results.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Troutman RC, Swinger C | year = 1978 | title = Refractive keratoplasty: keratophakia and keratomileusis | url = | journal = Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc. | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 329–39 }}</ref> This work was followed by that of the Russian scientist, [[Svyatoslav Fyodorov]] (1920-2000), who developed the [[Radial keratotomy]] (RK) in the 1970s and  designed the first posterior chamber implantable contact lenses ([[phakic intraocular lens]]) in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fyodorov|first=SN|coauthors=Vk Zuyev, BM Aznabayev|title=Intraocular correction of high myopia with negative posterior chamber lens|journal=Oftalmokhirurgiia|year=1991|volume=3|pages=57–58|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

===Medical laser===
In 1968, at the Northrop Corporation Research and Technology Center of the [[University of California]], [[Mani Lal Bhaumik]] was developing the carbon-dioxide laser. This was the origin of the excimer laser, the cornerstone of laser eye surgery. At a May 1973 meeting of the Denver Optical Society of America, in [[Denver, Colorado]], Bhaumik announced his success with laser and later patented his invention.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lacina WB, Eguchi RG, Mann MM, Bhaumik ML | year = 1971 | month = Jan | title = CO(2) Laser Frequency Doubling Using a Tellurium Reflector | url = | journal = Appl Opt. | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | page = | doi = 10.1364/AO.10.0221_1 }}</ref>

===Application of medical laser to refractive surgery===
In 1980, [[Rangaswamy Srinivasan]], at the [[IBM Research]] laboratory, discovered that an ultraviolet excimer laser could etch living tissue, with precision and with no thermal damage to the surrounding area. He named the phenomenon "ablative photo-decomposition" (APD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/ca/srinivasan.html |title=Prize for the Industrial Application of Physics Winner - American Institute of Physics |publisher=Aip.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>
Five years later, in 1985, Steven Trokel at the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University in New York city, published his work using the excimer laser in radial keratotomy.  He wrote,
:"The central corneal flattening obtained by radial diamond knife incisions has been duplicated by radial laser incisions in 18 enucleated human eyes. The incisions, made by 193 nm far-ultraviolet light radiation emitted by the excimer laser, produced corneal flattening ranging from 0.12 to 5.35 diopters. Both the depth of the corneal incisions and the degree of central corneal flattening correlated with the laser energy applied. Histopathology revealed the remarkably smooth edges of the laser incisions."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cotliar AM, Schubert HD, Mandel ER, Trokel SL | year = 1985 | month = Feb | title = Excimer laser radial keratotomy | url = | journal = Ophthalmology | volume = 92 | issue = 2| pages = 206–8 }}</ref>
Together with his colleagues, [[Charles Munnerlyn]] and Terry Clapham, Trokel founded VISX USA inc.<ref>[http://www.visx.com/contact.php] VISX USA Technology (Last accessed 4th June, 2012)</ref> Marguerite B.

==Introduction of LASIK==

===Patent===
On 20 June 1989, [[Gholam A. Peyman]] was granted a US patent for LASIK (US4840175). It was,
:"A method and apparatus for modifying the curvature of a live cornea via use of an excimer laser. The live cornea has a thin layer removed therefrom, leaving an exposed internal surface thereon. Then, either the surface or thin layer is exposed to the laser beam along a predetermined pattern to ablate desired portions. The thin layer is then replaced onto the surface. Ablating a central area of the surface or thin layer makes the cornea less curved, while ablating an annular area spaced from the center of the surface or layer makes the cornea more curved. The desired predetermined pattern is formed by use of a variable diaphragm, a rotating orifice of variable size, a movable mirror or a movable fiber optic cable through which the laser beam is directed towards the exposed internal surface or removed thin layer."<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents/US4840175] Patents at Google.com (last accessed 4th June, 2012)</ref>

===Implementation in USA===
The LASIK technique was implemented in the USA after its successful application elsewhere. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) commenced a trial of the excimer laser in 1989. The first enterprise to receive FDA approval to use an excimer laser for photo-refractive keratectomy was Summit Technology (founder and CEO, Dr. David Muller).<ref name="fda.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/SurgeryandLifeSupport/LASIK/ucm192110.htm |title=FDA-Approved Lasers for PRK and Other Refractive Surgeries |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>
In 1992, under the direction of the FDA, [[Ioannis Pallikaris|Pallikaris]] introduced LASIK to ten VISX centres. In 1998, the "Kremer Excimer Laser", serial number KEA 940202, received FDA approval for its singular use for performing LASIK.<ref name="Reference A">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/SurgeryandLifeSupport/LASIK/ucm192109.htm |title=List of FDA-Approved Lasers for LASIK |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> Subsequently, Summit Technology was the first company to receive FDA approval to mass manufacture and distribute excimer lasers. VISX and other companies followed.<ref name="Reference A"/>
[[File:MEL60-UOC.jpg|thumb|The excimer laser that was used for the first LASIK surgeries by I.Pallikaris]] Pallikaris suggested a flap of cornea could be raised by microkeratome prior to the performing of PRK with the excimer laser. The addition of a flap to PRK became known as LASIK.

==Further developments==
Since 1991, there have been further developments such as faster lasers; larger spot areas; bladeless flap incisions; intraoperative [[corneal pachymetry]]; and [[wavefront curvature sensor|"wavefront-optimized" and "wavefront-guided"]] techniques. 
However, use of the excimer laser risks damage to the [[retina]] and optic nerve. The goal of refractive surgery is to avoid permanently weakening the cornea with incisions and to deliver less energy to the surrounding tissues.

==Procedure==
[[File:Lasik UOC.ogg|thumb|Video of a complete LASIK-treatment]]
The procedure involves creating a thin flap on the eye, folding it to enable remodeling of the tissue beneath with a laser and repositioning the flap.

===Preoperative procedures===

====Contact lenses====
Patients wearing soft [[contact lenses]] are instructed to stop wearing them 5 to 21 days before surgery. One industry body recommends that patients wearing hard contact lenses should stop wearing them for a minimum of six weeks plus another six weeks for every three years the hard contacts have been worn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaeyes.org/lasik/faq/lasik-contacts.htm |title=Lasik and Contacts |publisher=Usaeyes.org |date=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>
The cornea is avascular because it must be transparent to function normally. Its cells absorb [[oxygen]] from the [[tears|tear film]]. Thus, low-oxygen-permeable contact lenses reduce the cornea's oxygen absorption, sometimes resulting in [[corneal neovascularization]]—the growth of blood vessels into the cornea. This causes a slight lengthening of inflammation duration and healing time and some pain during surgery, because of greater bleeding.
Although some contact lenses (notably modern RGP and soft silicone hydrogel lenses) are made of materials with greater oxygen permeability that help reduce the risk of corneal neovascularization, patients considering LASIK are warned to avoid over-wearing their contact lenses. Usually, it is recommended that they discontinue wearing contact lenses days or weeks before the LASIK eye surgery.

====Pre-operative examination and education====
In the USA, the FDA has approved LASIK for age 18 and over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaeyes.org/lasik/faq/lasik-age.htm |title=Age Issues For Lasik, All-Laser Lasik, PRK, LASEK, Epi-Lasik, CK, P-IOL, RLE, etc |publisher=Usaeyes.org |date=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> More importantly the patient's eye prescription should be stable for at least one year prior to surgery.
The patient may be examined with pupillary dilation and education given prior to the procedure. Before the surgery, the patient's [[cornea]]s are examined with a [[Corneal pachymetry|pachymeter]] to determine their thickness, and with a topographer, or corneal topography machine,<ref name="Finn"/> to measure their surface contour. Using low-power [[laser]]s, a topographer creates a [[topographic map]] of the cornea. The procedure is contraindicated if the topographer finds difficulties such as [[keratoconus]]<ref name="Finn"/> The preparatory process also detects [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]] and other irregularities in the shape of the cornea. Using this information, the surgeon calculates the amount and the location of corneal tissue to be removed. The patient is prescribed and self-administers an antibiotic beforehand to minimize the risk of infection after the procedure and is sometimes offered a short acting oral sedative medication as a pre-medication. Prior to the procedure, anaesthetic eye drops are instilled.

===Operative procedure===

====Flap creation====
A soft corneal suction ring is applied to the eye, holding the eye in place. This step in the procedure can sometimes cause small blood vessels to burst, resulting in bleeding or [[subconjunctival hemorrhage]] into the white ([[sclera]]) of the eye, a harmless side effect that resolves within several weeks. Increased suction causes a transient dimming of vision in the treated eye. Once the eye is immobilized, the flap is created. This process is achieved with a mechanical [[microkeratome]] using a metal blade, or a [[femtosecond]] laser that creates a series of tiny closely arranged bubbles within the cornea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaeyes.org/lasik/faq/intralase-intralasik.htm |title=All-Laser Lasik - iLasik - IntraLasik |publisher=Usaeyes.org |date=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> A hinge is left at one end of this flap. The flap is folded back, revealing the [[Stroma of cornea|stroma]], the middle section of the cornea. The process of lifting and folding back the flap can sometimes be uncomfortable.

====Laser remodelling====
The second step of the procedure uses an excimer laser (193&nbsp;nm) to remodel the corneal stroma. The laser [[vaporization|vaporizes]] the tissue in a finely controlled manner without damaging the adjacent stroma. No burning with heat or actual cutting is required to ablate the tissue. The layers of tissue removed are tens of [[micrometre]]s thick. Performing the laser ablation in the deeper corneal stroma provides for more rapid visual recovery and less pain than the earlier technique, [[photorefractive keratectomy]] (PRK).
During the second step, the patient's vision becomes blurry, once the flap is lifted. They will be able to see only white light surrounding the orange light of the laser, which can lead to mild disorientation. 
The excimer laser uses an eye tracking system that follows the patient's eye position up to 4,000 times per second, redirecting laser pulses for precise placement within the treatment zone. Typical pulses are around 1 [[millijoule]] (mJ) of pulse energy in 10 to 20 nanoseconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepatentsonline.com/5742626.html |title=Patent: ultraviolet solid state laser |publisher=Freepatentsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>

====Repositioning of the flap====
After the laser has reshaped the stromal layer, the LASIK flap is carefully repositioned over the treatment area by the surgeon and checked for the presence of air bubbles, debris, and proper fit on the eye. The flap remains in position by natural adhesion until healing is completed.

===Postoperative care===
Patients are usually given a course of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory eye drops. These are continued in the weeks following surgery. Patients are told to rest and are given dark eyeglasses to protect their eyes from bright lights and occasionally protective goggles to prevent rubbing of the eyes when asleep and to reduce dry eyes. They also are required to moisturize the eyes with preservative-free tears and follow directions for prescription drops. Occasionally after the procedure a bandage contact lens is placed to aid the healing, and typically removed after 3-4 days. Patients should be adequately informed by their surgeons of the importance of proper post-operative care to minimize the risk of complications. <ref name=dta>{{cite book|last=Dimitri T. Azar , Damien Gatinel|title=Refractive surgery|year=2007|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780323035996|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref>

==Wavefront-guided LASIK==
Wavefront-guided LASIK<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iroc.ch/wir_publikation.html |title=IROC . Institut für Refraktive und Ophthalmo-Chirurgie |publisher=Iroc.ch |date=2005-04-15 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> is a variation of LASIK surgery in which, rather than applying a simple correction of focusing power to the cornea (as in traditional LASIK), an [[ophthalmologist]] applies a spatially varying correction, guiding the computer-controlled excimer laser with measurements from a [[wavefront]] sensor. The goal is to achieve a more optically perfect eye, though the final result still depends on the physician's success at predicting changes that occur during healing and [[Alpins method of astigmatism analysis|other factors]] that may have to do with the regularity/irregularity of the cornea and the axis of any residual astigmatism. In older patients, [[scattering]] from microscopic particles ([[cataract]] or incipient cataract) may play a role that outweighs any benefit from wavefront correction. Therefore, patients expecting so-called "super vision" from such procedures may be disappointed.<ref name="Walsh2000A">Walsh MJ.

Australian ophthalmologist [[Noel A. Alpins]], who developed a [[Alpins method of astigmatism analysis|vector analysis method]] to analyze astigmatism in cataract, refractive, and corneal surgery, has long advocated combining "vector planning" with wavefront-guided LASIK.<ref name="Walsh2000A"/><ref name="Walsh2000"/><ref name="EW2000"/><ref name="Alpins2002Fail">{{cite journal |pmid=12458868 |year=2002 |last1=Alpins |first1=NA |title=Wavefront technology: A new advance that fails to answer old questions on corneal vs. refractive astigmatism correction |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=737–9. |journal=Journal of refractive surgery}}</ref> Alpins' contention is that the purely refraction-based approach represented by wavefront analysis contradicts corneal surgical experience developed over many years.<ref name="Alpins2002Fail" /> Refractive surgeons have long known that corneal regularity is the foundation of superior visual outcomes. Because refractive and corneal topographic astigmatism do not always align, corrections for internal optical errors surgically sculpted onto the cornea may increase corneal irregularity.<ref name="Alpins2002Fail" /> Alpins believes that the pathway to "super vision" requires a greater customized reduction of corneal astigmatism than is usually attempted, and that any remaining astigmatism ought to be regular (as opposed to irregular), which are both fundamental principles of vector planning overlooked by a purely wavefront-guided treatment plan.<ref name="Alpins2002Fail" /> Alpins' observation was confirmed in a prospective study of LASIK patients, which found a greater reduction in corneal astigmatism and better visual outcomes under [[mesopic vision|mesopic conditions]] using wavefront technology combined with vector analysis (the [[Alpins method of astigmatism analysis|Alpins method]]) than using wavefront technology alone, and also found equivalent higher-order aberrations.<ref name="Alpins2008">{{cite journal |pmid=18655973 |year=2008 |last1=Alpins |first1=N |last2=Stamatelatos |first2=G |title=Clinical outcomes of laser in situ keratomileusis using combined topography and refractive wavefront treatments for myopic astigmatism |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=1250–9 |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2008.03.028 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref>

No good data can be found that compare the percentage of LASIK procedures that employ wavefront guidance versus the percentage that do not, nor the percentage of refractive surgeons who have a preference one way or the other.

Still, surgeons claim patients are generally more satisfied with this technique than with previous methods, particularly regarding lowered incidence of "halos," the visual artifact caused by [[spherical aberration]] induced in the eye by earlier methods.  A meta-analysis of eight trials showed a lower incidence of these higher order aberrations in patients who had wavefront-guided LASIK compared to non-wavefront-guided LASIK.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21782089 |year=2011 |last1=Fares |first1=Usama |title=Efficacy, predictability, and safety of wavefront-guided refractive laser treatment: Metaanalysis |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=1465–1475 |journal=Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2011.02.029}}</ref> Based on their experience, the United States Air Force has described WFG-Lasik as giving "superior vision results".<ref>{{cite web|author=Sue Campbell |url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123009161 |title=Air Force aims for ‘weapons-grade’ vision |publisher=Af.mil |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>

The planning and analysis of [[corneal]] reshaping techniques such as LASIK have been standardized by the [[American National Standards Institute]], an approach based on the [[Alpins method of astigmatism analysis|Alpins Method of astigmatism analysis]].

====Controversies in safety and efficacy====
The reported figures for safety and efficacy are open to interpretation. In 2003, the Medical Defence Union (MDU), the largest insurer for doctors in the United Kingdom, reported a 166 percent increase in claims involving laser eye surgery; however, the MDU averred that some of these claims resulted primarily from patients' unrealistic expectations of LASIK rather than faulty surgery.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2937512.stm | work=BBC News | title=Laser eye surgery complaints up | date=2003-05-26 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref> A 2003 study, reported in the medical journal, ''Ophthalmology,'' found that nearly 18 percent of treated patients and 12 percent of treated eyes needed retreatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hersh PS, Fry KL, Bishop DS |title=Incidence and associations of retreatment after LASIK |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=110 |issue=4 |pages=748–54 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12689897 |doi=10.1016/S0161-6420(02)01981-4 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0161-6420(02)01981-4}}</ref> The authors concluded that higher initial corrections, astigmatism, and older age are risk factors for LASIK retreatment. 
In 2004, the British [[National Health Service]]'s [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) considered a [[systematic review]] of four randomized controlled trials before issuing guidelines for the use of LASIK within the NHS.<ref>[http://www.nice.org.uk/pdf/ip/233overview.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nice.org.uk/pdf/ip/Finalreport%20010605.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/pdf/2004_51_launchLASIK.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927121652/http://www.nice.org.uk/pdf/2004_51_launchLASIK.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> Regarding the procedure's efficacy, NICE reported,
:"Current evidence on LASIK for the treatment of refractive errors suggests that it is effective in selected patients with mild or moderate short-sightedness,"
but that 
:"Evidence is weaker for its effectiveness in severe short-sightedness and long-sightedness."
Regarding the procedure's safety, NICE reported that,
:"There are concerns about the procedure's safety in the long term and current evidence does not appear adequate to support its use within the NHS without special arrangements for consent and for audit or research."
Some refractive surgeons in the United Kingdom and United States, including at least one author of a study cited in the report, proposed that NICE relied on information that was severely dated and weakly researched.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=136786 British LASIK Report Flawed Says Study Author]. Press release]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://escrs.com/Publications/Eurotimes/05january/pdf/regmatters.pdf |title=ESCRS (European Society Of Cataract And Refractive Surgeons) website |publisher=Escrs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> Revised guidelines (IPG164) were issued by NICE in March 2006, stating,
: "Current evidence suggests that photorefractive (laser) surgery for the correction of refractive errors is safe and efficacious for use in appropriately selected patients."<ref>http://www.nice.org.uk/IPG164</ref>
On October 10, 2006, [[WebMD]] reported that statistical analysis revealed that the infection risk for contact lens wearers is greater than the infection risk from LASIK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/128/117072.htm |title=LASIK Surgery: Safer Than Contacts? |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2006-10-10 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> Daily contact lens wearers have a 1-in-100 chance of developing a serious, contact lens-related eye infection in 30 years of use, and a 1-in-2,000 chance of suffering significant vision loss as a result of infection. The researchers calculated the risk of significant vision loss consequence of LASIK surgery to be closer to 1-in-10,000 cases. 

On 25 February 2010, Morris Waxler, former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official in charge of approving laser vision correction (LASIK) devices, stated concerns about the risk of serious side-effects from LASIK and the original FDA approval process. His concerns about the safety of LASIK were discussed in an interview on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/lasik-eye-surgery-side-effects-fda-regulator/story?id=9933008 |title=LASIK Eye Surgery Side Effects Not Taken Seriously, Says Former FDA Regulator - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-02-25 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>
On 6 January 2011, Waxler requested that,
:"the Commissioner of Food and Drugs withdraw FDA approval (PMA) for all LASIK devices and issue a Public Health Advisory with a voluntary recall of LASIK devices in an effort to stop the epidemic of permanent eye injury caused by lasers and microkeratomes used for LASIK eye surgery."
Waxler alleged that,
:"The FDA was deprived of knowledge of the full extent of LASIK injuries prior to and during FDA reviews of documents submitted in support of the safety and effectiveness of LASIK devices under 21 CFR 812 and 21 CFR 814. In addition, LASIK manufacturers and their collaborators withheld safety and effectiveness information from their investigational device exemption (IDE) reports to the FDA. In addition, they hid LASIK injuries from FDA within the context of out-of-court settlement of innumerable lawsuits. Clinic-sponsored IDE studies cherry-picked, withheld, and hid data from FDA that clearly showed LASIK with excessive adverse event rates (greater than 1%). These activities were an industry-wide effort, organized wholly or in part by the manufacturers and their collaborators in order to circumvent FDA law and regulation. I will submit confidential information on these matters separately to FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/46440409/Waxler-Petition-FDA-Stop-LASIK-6Jan11 |title="Waxler Petition FDA Stop LASIK" (6 Jan 11) |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>

===Patient dissatisfaction===
Some patients with perceived poor outcomes from LASIK surgical procedures report a significantly reduced [[quality of life]] because of vision problems or physical pain associated with the surgery. Patients who have suffered LASIK complications have created websites and discussion forums where prospective and past patients can discuss the surgery. In 1999, "Surgical Eyes" was founded in New York city as a point of resource for patients with complications of LASIK and other refractive surgeries by RK patient, [[Ron Link (patient advocate)|Ron Link]], "Surgical Eyes" has since been superseded by the "Vision Surgery Rehab Network" (VSRN).<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/healthscience/19991012hlasik4.asp] "New site details downsides of laser eye surgery"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/healthfit/ledger/index.ssf?/news/ledger/stories/021102lasik.html |title=Better eyesight for most, but a few are seeing red. |publisher=Nj.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/100100/Worldandnation/Seeing_LASIK_s_risks_.shtml |title=World and nation: Seeing LASIK's risks clearly |publisher=Sptimes.com |date=2000-10-01 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fwweekly.com/content.asp?article=2439 |title=Feature: Shuttered Sight, Shattered Lives |publisher=FWWeekly |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref><ref>www.visionsurgeryrehab.org</ref>  No patient advocacy organization has changed its official position in regard to refractive surgery, despite the allegations of Morris Waxler, PhD concerning criminal misconduct during the approvals process.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=March 2011}} Between 1998 and 2006, the US FDA received 140 "negative reports relating to LASIK".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/fashion/13SKIN.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5087&em&en=a9b73aafeecaf5d1&ex=1205553600] "Lasik Surgery: When the Fine Print Applies to You", Abby Ellin, The New York Times, 13 March 2008.</ref>

====Higher-order aberrations====
The term "higher-order [[Optical aberration|aberration]]s" are visual problems that require special testing for diagnosis and are not corrected with normal spectacles (eye glasses). These [[Aberrations of the eye|aberrations]] include 'starbursts', 'ghosting', 'halos' and others.<ref name="Pop">{{cite journal |author=Pop M, Payette Y |title=Risk factors for night vision complaints after LASIK for myopia |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14711706 |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2003.09.022 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0161-6420(03)01213-2}}</ref> Some patients describe these symptoms post-operatively and associate them with the LASIK technique including the formation of the flap and the tissue ablation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sankara Nethralaya |title=Ocular aberrations after wavefront optimized LASIK for myopia |journal=Indian Journal of Ophthalmology |year=2010 |month=Jul-Aug |pages=307–312 |pmid=20534921 |doi=10.4103/0301-4738.64139 |volume=58 |issue=4 |last2=Basuthkar |first2=Subams |last3=Joseph |first3=Roy |pmc=2907032}}</ref> The advancement of the LASIK technology has reduced the risk of clinically significant visual impairment after surgery.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
There is a correlation between pupil size and aberrations.<ref>[http://www.usaeyes.org/lasik/faq/lasik-pupil-size.htm] "LASIK halo and starburst; pupil size importance". USAEyes</ref> This correlation may be the result of irregularity in the corneal tissue between the untouched part of the cornea and the reshaped part. Daytime post-LASIK vision is optimal, since the pupil size is smaller than the LASIK flap. However, at night, the pupil may [[Pupillary response|dilate]] such that light passes through the edge of the LASIK flap which gives rise to aberrations. LASIK and PRK may induce [[spherical aberration]] if the laser under corrects as it moves outward from the centre of the treatment zone, especially when major corrections are made. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
Others propose that higher order aberrations are present preoperatively.<ref>[http://www.operationauge.com/risks-lasik-lasek-prk.html "Individual Risk Factors of Halos, Loss of Contrast Sensitivity, Glare and Starbursts after LASIK."] operationauge.com</ref> They can be measured in micrometers (µm) whereas the smallest laser beam size approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] is about 1000 times larger, at 0.65&nbsp;mm.

These factors demonstrate the importance of careful patient selection for LASIK treatment.

====Dry eyes====
The most common patient complaint due to refractive surgery is dry eyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eyesurgerycosts.net/the-side-effects-of-laser-eye-surgery/|title=Side Effects of Laser Eye Surgery |publisher=Eyesurgerycosts.net |date=2011-012-18 |accessdate=2011-12-19}}</ref> It is reported by some patients in both the immediate and the late post-operative period.

Treatments include artificial tears, prescription tears and punctal occlusion. Punctal occlusion is accomplished by placing a collagen plug in the [[tear duct]], which normally drains fluid from the eye. Some patients complain of ongoing dry eye symptoms despite such treatments and dry eye symptoms may be permanent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/lasik/risks.htm |title=LASIK |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2008-11-11 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> Patients with non-Sjogren's based dry eye have been able to receive Lasik with application of autologous serum and punctal occlusion prior to surgery.<ref>{{Cite pmid|15188906 }}</ref>

==Complications==
Complications due to LASIK have been classified as those that occur due to preoperative, intraoperative, early postoperative, or late postoperative sources:<ref name="Majmudar">Majmudar, PA.

September, 2004.</ref>

===Intra-operative flap complications===
The incidence of flap complications is about 0.244%.<ref name="Carrillo">{{cite journal |author=Carrillo C, Chayet AS, Dougherty PJ, et al. |title=Incidence of complications during flap creation in LASIK using the NIDEK MK-2000 microkeratome in 26,600 cases |journal=J Refract Surg |volume=21 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=S655–7 |year=2005 |pmid=16212299 }}</ref> Flap complications (such as displaced flaps or folds in the flaps that necessitate repositioning, diffuse lamellar keratitis, and epithelial ingrowth) are common in lamellar corneal surgeries<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasikinstitute.org/Intraoperative.html |title=Eye Surgery Education Council |publisher=Lasikinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> but rarely lead to permanent loss of visual acuity.

====Slipped flap====
A "slipped flap" is a corneal flap that detaches from the rest of the cornea. The chances of this are greatest immediately after surgery, so patients typically are advised to go home and sleep to let the flap adhere and heal. Patients are usually given sleep goggles or eye shields to wear for several nights to prevent them from dislodging the flap in their sleep. A short operation time may decrease the chance of this complication, as there is less time for the flap to dry. {{citation needed|date= June 2012}}..

====Flap interface particles====
"Flap interface particles" are a finding whose clinical significance is undetermined.<ref name="Vesaluoma">{{cite journal |author=Vesaluoma M, Pérez-Santonja J, Petroll WM, Linna T, Alió J, Tervo T |title=Corneal stromal changes induced by myopic LASIK |journal=Invest.

===Early post-operative complications===

====Diffuse lamellar keratitis====
[[Diffuse lamellar keratitis]] (DLK) is an inflammatory process that involves an accumulation of white blood cells at the interface between the LASIK corneal flap and the underlying stroma. It is known colloquially as "sands of Sahara syndrome" because on slit lamp exam, the inflammatory infiltrate appears similar to waves of sand. The USAeyes organisation reports an incidence of 2.3% after LASIK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaeyes.org/lasik/faq/lasik-intralasik-dlk.htm |title=Diffuse Lamellar Keratitis - DLK and Lasik, All-Laser Lasik, Sands of Sahara |publisher=Usaeyes.org |date=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref><ref name="Sun">{{cite journal |author=Sun L, Liu G, Ren Y, ''et al.'' |title=Efficacy and safety of LASIK in 10,052 eyes of 5081 myopic Chinese patients |journal=J Refract Surg |volume=21 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=S633–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16212294 }}</ref> It is most commonly treated with steroid eye drops. Sometimes it is necessary for the eye surgeon to lift the flap and manually remove the accumulated cells. DLK has not been reported with photorefractive keratectomy due to the absence of flap creation.

====Infection====
The incidence of infection responsive to treatment has been estimated at 0.4%.<ref name="Sun"/>

====Keratoconus====
Keratoconus is a genetic condition that disposes the cornea to thinning after surgery. Although this condition is screened for in the preoperative examination, it is possible, in rare cases, (about 1 in 5,000) {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} for the condition to appear later in life (the mid-40s). If this occurs, the patient may need rigid gas permeable contact lenses, Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segments (Intacs)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaeyes.org/faq/subjects/intacs.htm |title=Intacs for Mild Nearsighted Vision Correction and Keratoconus |publisher=Usaeyes.org |date=2006-04-08 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> Corneal Collagen Crosslinking with Riboflavin<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaeyes.org/lasik/faq/c3-r.htm |title=C3-R Corneal Collagen Crosslinking with Riboflavin |publisher=Usaeyes.org |date=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> or a corneal transplant.

====Subconjunctival haemorrhage====
A report shows the incidence of [[subconjunctival hemorrhage]] has been estimated at 10.5%.<ref name="Sun"/>

The incidence of epithelial ingrowth has been estimated at 0.1%.<ref name="Sun"/>

====Late traumatic flap dislocations====
Cases of late traumatic flap dislocations have been reported up to seven years after LASIK.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cheng AC, Rao SK, Leung GY, Young AL, Lam DS |title=Late traumatic flap dislocations after LASIK |journal=J Refract Surg |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=500–4 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16722490 |url=http://www.journalofrefractivesurgery.com/showAbst.asp?thing=12869}} {{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref>

===Other===

====Microfolding====
[[Microfolding]] has been reported as "an almost unavoidable complication of LASIK" whose "clinical significance appears negligible."<ref name="Vesaluoma"/>

====Glaucoma diagnosis====
After LASIK, measurements of intraocular pressure (used to diagnose and treat [[glaucoma]]) can be more difficult. The changes also affect the calculations used to select the correct intraocular lens implant for cataract surgery. This is known as "refractive surprise." Preoperative, operative and postoperative measurements can assist. {{citation needed|date= June 2012}}

* [[Choroidal neovascularization]]: the incidence of choroidal neovascularization has been estimated at 0.33 percent.<ref name="Ruiz-Moreno"/>
* [[Uveitis]]: the incidence of uveitis has been estimated at 0.18 percent.<ref name="Suarez">{{cite journal |author=Suarez E, Torres F, Vieira JC, Ramirez E, Arevalo JF |title=Anterior uveitis after laser in situ keratomileusis |journal=J Cataract Refract Surg |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=1793–8 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12388030 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0886335002013640 |doi=10.1016/S0886-3350(02)01364-0}}</ref>

====Mountain climbers====
Although the cornea usually is thinner after LASIK, because of the removal of part of the stroma, refractive surgeons strive to maintain the maximum thickness to avoid structurally weakening the cornea. Decreased atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes has not been demonstrated as extremely dangerous to the eyes of LASIK patients. However, some [[mountain climber]]s have experienced a myopic shift at extreme altitudes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boes DA, Omura AK, Hennessy MJ |title=Effect of high-altitude exposure on myopic laser in situ keratomileusis |journal=J Cataract Refract Surg |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=1937–41 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11738908 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0886335001010744 |doi=10.1016/S0886-3350(01)01074-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dimmig JW, Tabin G |title= The ascent of Mount Everest following laser in situ keratomileusis |journal=J Refract Surg |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=48–51 |year=2003 |pmid=12553606 }}</ref>

====Effect on corneal leukocytes and keratocytes====
There is a report of decreases in numbers of [[corneal keratocyte]]s ([[fibroblast]]s) after LASIK.<ref name="pmid17057788">{{cite journal |author=Erie JC, McLaren JW, Hodge DO, Bourne WM |title=Long term corneal keratocyte deficits after photorefractive keratectomy and laser in situ keratomileusis|journal=Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc |volume=103 |issue= |pages=56–66; discussion 67–8 |year=2005 |pmid=17057788 |pmc=1447559 |url=http://www.aosonline.org/xactions/2005/1545-6110_v103_p056.pdf}}</ref>

==Onset of presbyopia==
Myopic (nearsighted) people who are close to the age (mid- to late-forties) when they will require either reading glasses or bifocal eyeglasses may find that they still require reading glasses despite having undergone refractive LASIK surgery. Myopic people generally require reading glasses or bifocal eyeglasses at a later age than people who are emmetropic (those who see without eyeglasses), but this benefit may be lost if they undergo LASIK. This is not a complication but an expected result of the physical laws of optics. Although there is currently no method to completely eradicate the need for reading glasses in this group, it may be minimized by performing a variation of the LASIK procedure called "slight [[monovision]]." In this procedure, which is performed exactly like distance-vision-correction LASIK, the dominant eye is set for distance vision, while the non-dominant eye is set to the prescription of the patient's reading glasses. This allows the patient to achieve a similar effect as wearing bifocals. The majority of patients tolerate this procedure very well and do not notice any shift between near and distance viewing, although a small portion of the population has trouble adjusting to the monovision effect. This can be tested for several days prior to surgery by wearing contact lenses that mimic the monovision effect. Recently, a variation of the laser ablation pattern called [[PresbyLASIK]], has been developed to reduce or eliminate dependence on reading glasses while retaining distance vision. {{citation needed|date= June 2012}}

==Age considerations==
New advances in eyesight corrective surgery are providing patients with greater choices. Patients in their 40s or 50s may also be candidates for [[implantable collamer lens|implantable lenses]], especially if there are signs of early cataract development.<ref>

==Lasik versus photorefractive keratectomy==
There have been a number of studies comparing Lasik to [[photorefractive keratectomy]], or PRK. Lasik is associated with decreased inflammation and quicker recovery, but at the cost of decreased expression of [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) at the surgical bed.<ref name="NGF">{{Cite pmid|15953424 }}</ref> PRK, on the other hand, has longer recovery time with more postoperative discomfort and irritation, but rates of ocular dryness are less,<ref>{{Cite pmid|12532491 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|11020617 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|16883946 }}</ref> as only the epithelium is denuded in this approach. Lasik, on the other hand, involves creation of a corneal flap.<ref>{{Cite pmid|11019867 }}</ref> The medical literature is not uniform, however, regarding their comparative effects on ocular dryness,<ref>{{Cite pmid|12011749 }}</ref> although the majority of research supports PRK as causing less reduction in the tear film. Surgical technique has improved with time, and a more recent study has shown no difference in ocular dryness in Lasik or PRK at 12 months, as compared to pre-operative baseline, although interval assessments at months 1, 3 and 6 did show dryness in both groups.<ref>{{Cite pmid|22892151 }}</ref> Quantitative changes occurring at the eye surface are more pronounced with Lasik, but more irritation, pain and eyelid sticking are felt with PRK, which could be related to increased denervation with Lasik.<ref name="NGF"/><ref>{{Cite pmid| 11311627}}</ref> A Cochrane Systematic review comparing the LASIK and PRK concludes that LASIK may have faster recovery time and lower pain in comparison to PRK.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shortt|first=AJ|coauthors=Allan, BD; Evans, JR|title=Laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) versus photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for myopia.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2013 Jan 31|volume=1|pages=CD005135|pmid=23440799}}</ref> .
