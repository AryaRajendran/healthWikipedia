'''Pulmonary circulation''' is the portion of the [[cardiovascular system]] which carries [[oxygen|deoxygenated]] [[blood]] away from the heart, to the [[lungs]], and returns oxygenated (oxygen-rich) blood back to the heart. The term pulmonary circulation is readily paired and contrasted with the [[systemic circulation]]. 
A separate system known as the [http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=-1710882759 bronchial circulation] supplies blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung..

==Route==
Pulmonary circulation is the movement of blood from the heart, to the lungs, and back to the heart again. De-oxygenated blood leaves the heart, goes to the lungs, and then re-enters the heart; deoxygenated blood leaves through the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery, the only artery in the body that carries deoxygenated blood, to the capillaries where carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood cell into the alveoli, and oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli into the blood. Blood leaves the capillaries to the pulmonary vein, the only vein in the body that carries oxygen-rich blood in the body, to the heart, where it re-enters at the left atrium.

===Right heart===
Oxygen-depleted blood from the [[body]] leaves the systemic circulation when it enters the [[right heart]], more specifically the [[right atrium]] through the [[superior vena cava|superior (upper) vena cava]] and [[inferior vena cava|inferior (lower) vena cava]]. The blood is then pumped through the [[tricuspid valve]] (or right atrioventricular valve), into the [[right ventricle]]. Blood is then pumped through the semilunar valve and into the [[pulmonary artery]].

===Arteries===
From the [[right ventricle]], blood is pumped through the pulmonary [[semilunar valve]] into the left and right pulmonary arteries (one for each lung) and travels through the [[lungs]].

===Lungs===
The pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where it releases [[carbon dioxide]] and picks up oxygen during [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Arteries are further divided in to very fine branches called the capillaries. In structure the capillaries are very thin walled. Their function is to carry blood to all cells of the body.

===Veins===
The oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through [[pulmonary veins]], which return it to the [[left heart]], completing the pulmonary cycle. This blood then enters the [[left atrium]], which pumps it through the bicuspid valve, also called the mitral or left atrioventricular valve, into the [[left ventricle]]. The blood is then distributed to the body through the systemic circulation before returning again to the pulmonary circulation.

==History==
According to R.A. Young, "Wiberg suggests that the early [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] knew of the circulation, and quotes a passage from one of the [[Hippocratic]] writings which would bear that interpretation."<ref>{{Cite journal

Pulmonary circulation was described by [[Ibn al-Nafis]] in his ''Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon'' (1242). It was also described by [[Michael Servetus]] in the "Manuscript of Paris"<ref>2011 “The love for truth. Life and work of Michael Servetus”, (El amor a la verdad. Vida y obra de Miguel Servet.), printed by Navarro y Navarro, Zaragoza, collaboration with the Government of Navarra, Department of Institutional Relations and Education of the Government of Navarra, 607 pp, 64 of them illustrations, p 215-228 & 62nd illustration (XLVII)</ref> (near 1546, never published) and later published  in his ''[[Christianismi Restitutio]]'' (1553).
Since it was a theology work condemned by most of the Christian factions of his time, the discovery remained mostly unknown until the dissections of [[William Harvey]] in 1616.

==Embryonic==
The pulmonary circulation loop is virtually bypassed in [[fetal circulation]].  The fetal lungs are collapsed, and blood passes from the right atrium directly into the left atrium through the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], an open passage between the two atria.  When the lungs expand at birth, the pulmonary pressure drops and blood is drawn from the right atrium into the right ventricle and through the pulmonary circuit.  Over the course of several months, the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] closes, leaving a shallow depression known as the [[Fossa ovalis (heart)|fossa ovalis]] in the adult heart.
