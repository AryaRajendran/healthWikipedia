'''Dysmenorrhea''' (or '''dysmenorrhoea''') is a [[gynaecology|gynecological]] medical condition of [[pain]] during [[menstruation]] that interferes with daily activities, as defined by [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]]<ref name=acog>Patient Education Pamphlet: [http://www.acog.org/publications/patient_education/bp046.cfm Dysmenorrhea] By [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], retrieved January 2011</ref> and others.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/dysmenorrhea TheFreeDictionary > dysmenorrhea] Citing:

Also reviewed by David Zieve</ref> This article uses the dysmenorrhea definition of menstrual pain that interferes with daily activities, and uses the term '''menstrual pain''' as any pain during menstruation whether it is normal or abnormal.

''Menstrual pain'' is often used synonymously with '''menstrual cramps''', but the latter may also refer to menstrual [[uterine contractions]], which are generally of higher strength, duration and frequency than in the rest of the menstrual cycle.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/menstrual_cramps/page3.htm medicinenet.com > Menstrual Cramps] Retrieved January 2011</ref>

Dysmenorrhea can feature different kinds of pain, including sharp, throbbing, dull, nauseating, burning, or shooting pain. Dysmenorrhea may precede menstruation by several days or may accompany it, and it usually subsides as menstruation tapers off. Dysmenorrhea may coexist with excessively heavy [[blood]] loss, known as ''[[menorrhagia]]''. 

Secondary dysmenorrhea is diagnosed when symptoms are attributable to an underlying [[disease]], [[Disease|disorder]], or structural abnormality either within or outside the uterus. Primary dysmenorrhea is diagnosed when none of these is detected.

==Classification==
Dysmenorrhea can be classified as either primary or secondary based on the absence or presence of an underlying cause. Secondary dysmenorrhea is dysmenorrhea which is associated with an existing condition. The most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea is [[endometriosis]].<ref name=french /> Other causes include [[leiomyoma]],<ref name="Hilário">{{cite journal |author=Hilário SG, Bozzini N, Borsari R, Baracat EC |title=Action of aromatase inhibitor for treatment of uterine leiomyoma in perimenopausal patients |journal=Fertil.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
The main symptom of dysmenorrhea is pain concentrated in the lower [[abdomen]], in the umbilical region or the suprapubic region of the abdomen. It is also commonly felt in the right or left abdomen. It may radiate to the [[thigh]]s and lower [[human back|back]]. 

Symptoms often co-occurring with menstrual pain include [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]] or [[constipation]], [[headache]], [[dizziness]], [[disorientation]], hypersensitivity to sound, light, smell and touch, [[fainting]], and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. Symptoms of dysmenorrhea often begin immediately following ovulation and can last until the end of menstruation. This is because dysmenorrhea is often associated with changes in hormonal levels in the body that occur with ovulation. The use of certain types of birth control pills can prevent the symptoms of dysmenorrhea, because the birth control pills stop ovulation from occurring.

==Pathophysiology==
During a woman's menstrual cycle, the [[endometrium]] thickens in preparation for potential [[pregnancy]]. After [[ovulation]], if the [[ovum]] is not [[Human fertilization|fertilized]] and there is no pregnancy, the built-up uterine tissue is not needed and thus shed.

Molecular compounds called [[prostaglandin]]s are released during menstruation, due to the destruction of the [[endometrial]] cells, and the resultant release of their contents.<ref name="Cochrane NSAIDs">{{cite journal |author=Lethaby A, Augood C, Duckitt K, Farquhar C |title=Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for heavy menstrual bleeding |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD000400 |year=2007 |pmid=17943741 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000400.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Lethaby |editor1-first=Anne}}</ref> Release of [[prostaglandins]] and other inflammatory mediators in the [[uterus]] cause the uterus to contract. These substances are thought to be a major factor in primary dysmenorrhea.<ref>Wright, Jason and Solange Wyatt. ''The Washington Manual Obstetrics and Gynecology Survival Guide''. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 2003. ISBN 0-7817-4363-X{{pn|date=January 2013}}</ref> When the uterine muscles contract, they [[vasoconstriction|constrict the blood supply]] to the tissue of the endometrium, which, in turn, breaks down and dies. These uterine contractions continue as they squeeze the old, dead endometrial tissue through the [[cervix]] and out of the body through the [[vagina]]. These contractions, and the resulting temporary oxygen deprivation to nearby tissues, are responsible for the pain or "cramps" experienced during menstruation. 

Compared with other women, women with primary dysmenorrhea have increased activity of the uterine muscle with increased contractility and increased frequency of contractions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosenwaks Z, Seegar-Jones G |title=Menstrual pain: its origin and pathogenesis |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=25 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=207–12 |year=1980 |month=October |pmid=7001019 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

In one research study using [[MRI]], visible features of the uterus were compared in dysmenorrheic and eumenorrheic (normal) participants. The study concluded that in dysmenorrheic patients, visible features on cycle days 1-3 correlated with the degree of pain, and differed significantly from the control group.<ref name=kataoka>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of ''dysmenorrhea'' is usually made simply on a [[medical history]] of menstrual pain that interferes with daily activities. However, there is no universally accepted gold standard technique for quantifying the severity of menstrual pains.<ref name=Wyatt2002/> Yet, there are quantification models, called ''menstrual symptometrics'', that can be used to estimate the severity of menstrual pains as well as correlate them with pain in other parts of the body, [[menstrual bleeding]] and degree of interference with daily activities.<ref name=Wyatt2002>{{cite journal |pmid=12095497 |year=2002 |last1=Wyatt |first1=KM |last2=Dimmock |first2=PW |last3=Hayes-Gill |first3=B |last4=Crowe |first4=J |last5=O'Brien |first5=PM |title=Menstrual symptometrics: A simple computer-aided method to quantify menstrual cycle disorders |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=96–101 |journal=Fertility and sterility}}</ref>

===Further work-up===
Once a diagnosis of dysmenorrhea is made, further work-up is required to search for any underlying cause of it, in order to be able to treat it specifically and to avoid aggravation of a perhaps serious underlying cause.

Further work-up includes a specific [[medical history]] of symptoms and menstrual cycles and a pelvic exam.<ref name=acog/> Based on results from these, additional exams and tests may be motivated, such as:
* A [[pap test]]<ref name=acog/>
* Certain lab tests<ref name=acog/>
* [[Gynecologic ultrasonography]]<ref name=acog/>
In some cases, [[laparoscopy]] may be required.<ref name=acog/>

==Management==
===NSAIDs===
[[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) are effective in relieving the pain of primary dysmenorrhea.<ref name=Coch10>{{cite journal |pmid=20091521 |year=2010 |last1=Marjoribanks |first1=J |last2=Proctor |first2=M |last3=Farquhar |first3=C |last4=Derks |first4=RS |title=Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for dysmenorrhoea |issue=1 |pages=CD001751 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001751.pub2 |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |editor1-last=Marjoribanks |editor1-first=Jane}}</ref> They can have [[adverse effect|side effect]]s of nausea, [[dyspepsia]], [[peptic ulcer]], and diarrhea.<ref name=Rossi2006>Rossi S, editor.

===Other===
A review indicated the effectiveness of use of [[transdermal]] [[nitroglycerin]].<ref name=morgan>{{cite journal |author=Morgan PJ, Kung R, Tarshis J |title=Nitroglycerin as a uterine relaxant: a systematic review |journal=J Obstet Gynaecol Can |volume=24|issue=5 |pages=403–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12196860 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Alternative medicine===
A number of alternative therapies have been studied in the treatment of dysmenorrhea. 

One review found the effectiveness of [[acupressure]], behavioral interventions, [[thiamine]], [[vitamin E]], topical heat, and [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] is likely while the effects of [[acupuncture]], [[fish oil]], [[magnets]] and [[vitamin B12]] is unknown.<ref name=BMJ11>{{cite journal|last=Latthe|first=PM|coauthors=Champaneria, R, Khan, KS|title=Dysmenorrhoea|journal=Clinical evidence|date=2011 Feb 21|volume=2011|pmid=21718556}}</ref> Spinal manipulation is unlikely to be helpful.<ref name=BMJ11/>

A 2008 systematic review found promising evidence for [[Chinese herbal medicine]] for primary dysmenorrhea, but that the evidence was limited by its poor methodological quality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhu X, Proctor M, Bensoussan A, Wu E, Smith CA |title=Chinese herbal medicine for primary dysmenorrhoea |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD005288 |year=2008 |pmid=18425916 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005288.pub3 |editor1-last=Zhu |editor1-first=Xiaoshu}}</ref>

Behavioral therapies assume that the physiological process underlying dysmenorrhea is influenced by environmental and psychological factors, and that dysmenorrhea can be effectively treated by physical and cognitive procedures that focus on coping strategies for the symptoms rather than on changes to the underlying processes. A 2007 [[systematic review]] found some scientific evidence that behavioral interventions may be effective, but that the results should be viewed with caution due to poor quality of the data.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Proctor ML, Murphy PA, Pattison HM, Suckling J, Farquhar CM |title= Behavioural interventions for primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea |journal= Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=3 |pages=CD002248 |year=2007 |pmid=17636702 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002248.pub3 |editor1-last= Proctor |editor1-first= Michelle}}</ref>

One review found the available evidence for the use of acupuncture to treat dysmenorrhea suggests it may reduce pain, but further research with well designed clinical trials is needed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith CA, Zhu X, He L, Song J |title=Acupuncture for primary dysmenorrhoea |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD007854 |year=2011 |pmid=21249697 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007854.pub2 |url=}}</ref>

Several nutritional [[Dietary supplement|supplements]] have been suggested as effective in treating dysmenorrhea. One review found that [[Vitamin B1]] has been shown to be effective for pain when taken at 100 mg daily based on one large trial. [[Magnesium]] supplement is a promising possible treatment as well, though no strong recommendations can be made for what doses should be used until further trials are completed.  There is insufficient evidence to recommend any other herbal or dietary supplement, including [[omega-3 fatty acids]], [[vitamin E]], [[vitamin B6]] among others which have been studied.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Proctor ML, Murphy PA |title=Herbal and dietary therapies for primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD002124 |year=2001 |pmid=11687013 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002124 |url=}}</ref> 

Although claims have been made for [[chiropractic]] care, under the theory that treating [[subluxation]]s in the [[Vertebral column|spine]] may decrease symptoms,<ref>{{cite book |title= The Chiropractic Profession: Its Education, Practice, Research and Future Directions |author= Chapman-Smith D |year=2000 |chapter= Scope of practice|isbn=1-892734-02-8 |publisher=NCMIC |location= West Des Moines, IA}}{{pn|date=January 2013}}</ref> a 2006 systematic review found that overall no evidence suggests that [[spinal manipulation]] is effective for treatment of primary and secondary dysmenorrhea.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Cochrane Database Syst Rev |year=2006 |issue=3 |pages=CD002119 |title= Spinal manipulation for primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea |author= Proctor ML, Hing W, Johnson TC, Murphy PA |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002119.pub3 |pmid=16855988 |volume= 3 |editor1-last= Proctor |editor1-first= Michelle}}</ref>
