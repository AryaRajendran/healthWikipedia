[[File:Radura international.svg|thumb|150px|right|The international [[Radura]] logo, used to show a food has been treated with ionizing radiation.]]

'''Food irradiation''' is the process of treating food with a specific dosage of [[ionizing radiation]].<ref name="FI">anon., Food Irradiation&nbsp;– A technique for preserving and improving the safety of food, WHO, Geneva, 1991</ref> This treatment slows or halts spoilage by retarding enzymic action or destroying microorganisms and it can also inactivate foodborne pathogenic organisms (reducing the risk of food borne illness). Further applications include sprout inhibition, delay of ripening, increase of juice yield, and improvement of re-hydration. Irradiation is also used to prevent the spread of invasive insect species that could be associated with fresh produce (e.g. fruit fly pests).

Ionizing radiation affects cells and microorganisms by damaging their [[DNA]] beyond its ability to [[DNA repair|repair]], breaking down cell membranes and interrupting enzymic pathways. Organisms can no longer successfully continue the process of [[cell division]].  The major effect of irradiation is to generate short-lived and transient radicals (e.g. the hydroxy radical, the hydrogen atom and solvated electrons) that in turn damage DNA and intercellular structures. The target organism ceases all processes related to [[Developmental biology|maturation]] or [[reproduction]]. At high enough doses the target organism does not survive.<ref name="FI"/> Irradiated food does not become radioactive, as the particles that transmit radiation are not themselves radioactive. Still there is some controversy in the application of irradiation possibly due to it being confused with radioactive contamination and an imputed association with the nuclear industry, and also perhaps because people think that chemical changes will be different than the chemical changes due to heating food (as ionizing radiation produces a higher energy transfer per collision than conventional radiant heat). However, research has found that most, if not all, of the substances formed in irradiated food are also found in food that has been subjected to other processing treatments and are not exclusively formed by irradiation. Furthermore, the quantities in which they occur in irradiated food are not significantly higher than those being formed in heat treatments.<ref name="JECFI"/><ref name="WHO1994">anon., Safety and nutritional adequacy of irradiated food, WHO, Geneva, 1994</ref><ref name="JSGHDI"/><ref name="EFSA2011">anon., Scientific Opinion on the Chemical Safety of Irradiation of Food, EFSA Journal 2011;9(4):1930 [57 pp.]. doi:10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1930 last visited 2013-03-03</ref>

Food irradiation is currently permitted by over 50 countries, and the volume of food treated is estimated to exceed 500,000 metric tons annually worldwide; however, the extent of clearances is varying significantly, from a single food category(dried herbs, spices and vegetable seasoningss) in Austria, Germany, and many other countries of the European Union to any food in Brazil.<ref>[http://nucleus.iaea.org/CIR/CIR/FICDB.html Food Irradiation Clearances]</ref><ref>Food irradiation, Position of ADA, J Am Diet Assoc. 2000;100:246-253. http://www.mindfully.org/Food/Irradiation-Position-ADA.htm retrieved November 15, 2007</ref><ref name="IMRP2006">C.M.

Technol. 22 (2011), 121-126</ref>

[[Irradiation]] is a more general term of the exposure of materials to radiation to achieve a technical goal (in this context "ionizing radiation" is implied). As such it is also used on non-food items, such as [[medical device]]s, plastics, tubes for gas pipelines, hoses for floor heating, shrink-foils for food [[packaging]], automobile parts, wires and cables (isolation), tires, and even gemstones.

==Processing of food by ionizing radiation==
By irradiating food, depending on the dose, some or all of the [[microorganism]]s, [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, or [[insect]]s present are destroyed or rendered incapable of reproduction. Hence pathogenic organisms can be inactivated, reducing the risk of food borne illness, and spoilage organisms can also be severely affected, thereby prolonging the shelf-life of the food. Some foods, e.g., [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s, are irradiated at sufficient doses (five [[gray (unit)|kilograys]] or more) to reduce the microbial counts by several orders of magnitude; such ingredients do not carry over spoilage or pathogen microorganisms into the final product. It has also been shown that irradiation can delay the ripening of fruits or the sprouting of vegetables.<ref name="FI"/>

Insect pests can be [[sterility (physiology)|sterilized]] (be made incapable of proliferation) using irradiation at relatively low doses.<ref>Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, IAEA, International Database on Insect Disinfestation and Sterilization&nbsp;– IDIDAS&nbsp;– http://www-ididas.iaea.org/IDIDAS/default.htm last visited November 16, 2007</ref>

Some foods, particularly fruits and vegetables, are not available for sale on the global market unless treated to prolong shelf life for transportation. This may include radiation processing. This application has not yet been exploited. In contrast, irradiation to eliminate insect pests to fulfill quarantine requirements is gaining commercial significance.

Food irradiation is sometimes referred to as "cold pasteurization"<ref>Cold Pasteurization of Food By Irradiation by Tim Roberts, Extension Specialist, Food Safety, Virginia Tech; Publication Number 458-300, posted August 1998 http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/foods/458-300/458-300.html retrieved on November 15, 2007 {{Wayback|url=http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/foods/458-300/458-300.html|date =20071112114155|bot=DASHBot}}</ref> or "electronic pasteurization"<ref>''See, e.g.,'' The Truth about Irradiated Meat, CONSUMER REPORTS 34-37 (Aug. 2003).</ref> because ionizing the food does not heat the food to high temperatures during the process, as in heat-pasteurization (at a typical dose of 10 kGy, food that is physically equivalent to water would warm by about 2.5 °C). The treatment of solid food by ionizing radiation can provide an effect similar to heat pasteurization of liquids, such as milk. The use of the term "cold pasteurization" to describe irradiated foods is controversial, because pasteurization and irradiation are fundamentally different processes, although the intended end results can in some cases be similar.

===Technologies===
Irradiation treatments are also sometimes classified as [[radappertization]], [[radicidation]] and [[radurization]].<ref>D.A.E. Ehlermann, The RADURA-terminology and food irradiation, Food Control 20 (2009), 526-528, {{doi|10.1016/j.foodcont.2008.07.023}}</ref>

[[File:E-beam-x-ray-gamma-efficiency.jpg|200px|thumbnail|Efficiency illustration of the different radiation technologies (electron beam, X-ray, gamma rays)]]

==== Electron irradiation ====
Electron irradiation uses electrons accelerated in an electric field to a velocity close to the speed of light. Electrons are particulate radiation and, as any other particulate radiation, have a limited range in matter. For this reason, electrons do not penetrate the product beyond a few centimeters, depending on product density. However, electron facilties (like gamma and x-ray facilities) rely on substantial concrete shields to protect workers and the environment from radiation exposure.

====Gamma irradiation====
[[Gamma ray|Gamma radiation]] is radiation of [[photon]]s in the gamma part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The radiation is obtained through the use of [[radioisotope]]s, generally [[cobalt-60]] but [[caesium-137]] can also be used as a source. Cobalt-60 is bred from cobalt-59 using neutron irradiation in specifically designed nuclear reactors.  Caesium-137 is recovered during the processing of [[spent nuclear fuel]]. Because this technology&nbsp;– except for military applications&nbsp;– is not commercially available, insufficient quantities of it are available on the global isotope markets for use in large scale, commercial irradiators. Presently, caesium-137 is used only in small hospital units to treat blood before transfusion to prevent [[Graft-versus-host disease]].

Food irradiation using cobalt-60 is the preferred method by most processors, because the deeper penetration enables administering treatment to entire industrial pallets or totes, reducing the need for material handling.<ref>anon., Gamma Irradiators for Radiation Processing, IAEA, Vienna, 2005</ref> A pallet or tote is typically exposed for several minutes to hours depending on dose. Radioactive material must be monitored and carefully stored to shield workers and the environment from its gamma rays. During operation this is achieved by substantial concrete shields. With most designs the radioisotope can be lowered into a water-filled source storage pool to allow maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield. In this mode the water in the pool absorbs the radiation. Other uncommonly used designs feature dry storage by providing movable shields that reduce radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber.

One variant of gamma irradiators keeps the cobalt-60 under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated under water in hermetic bells. No further shielding is required for such designs.

====X-ray irradiation====
Similar to gamma radiation, [[X-ray]]s are photon radiation of a wide energy spectrum and an alternative to isotope based irradiation systems. X-rays are generated by colliding accelerated electrons with a dense material (target) such as [[tantalum]] or [[tungsten]] in a process known as [[bremsstrahlung]]-conversion. X-ray irradiators are scalable and have deep penetration comparable to Co-60, with the added benefit that the electronic source stops radiating when switched off. They also permit dose uniformity, but these systems generally have low energetic efficiency during the conversion of electron energy to photon radiation requiring much more electrical energy than other systems. Like most other types of facilities, X-ray systems rely on concrete shields to protect the environment and workers from radiation.

[[File:Beta-e-beam-Gamma-X-ray-efficiency.jpg|200px|thumbnail|Illustration of the penetration properties of the different radiation technologies (electron beam, X-ray, gamma rays)]]

Nominal X-ray energy is usually limited to 5 MeV; the USA has provisions for up to 7.5 MeV, which increases conversion efficiency. Another development is the availability of electron accelerators with extremely high power output, up to 1,000&nbsp;kW beam. At a conversion efficiency of up to 12%, the X-ray power may reach (including filtering and other losses) 100&nbsp;kW; this power would be equivalent to a gamma facility with Co-60 of about 6.5 MCi.

==== Infrastructure====
The safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency]] and monitored by the different national Nuclear Regulatory Commissions. The incidents that have occurred in the past are documented by the agency and thoroughly analyzed to determine root cause and improvement potential. Such improvements are then mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.

Care must be taken not to expose the operators and the environment to radiation or radioactive contamination. Interlocks and safeguards are mandated to minimize this risk. Nevertheless there have been radiation related deaths and injury amongst workers of such facilities, many of them caused by the operators themselves overriding the interlocks.<ref name="Soreq">[[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. [http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub925_web.pdf ''The Radiological Accident in Soreq'']</ref> "Ordinary" occupational safety regulations also apply to radiation processing facilities; the radiation aspects are typically excluded and supervised by special authorities.

An incident in [[Decatur, Georgia]] where water soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool requiring [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] intervention<ref>[http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1989/in89082.html Information Notice No. 89-82: RECENT SAFETY-RELATED INCIDENTS AT LARGE IRRADIATORS]</ref> has led to near elimination of this radioisotope; it has been replaced by the more costly, non-water soluble cobalt-60.

National and international regulations on the levels and types of energy used to irradiate food generally set standards that prevent the possibility of inducing radioactivity in treated foods, and, hence, excluding the risk to workers and the environment.

===Cost===
The cost of food irradiation is influenced by dose requirements, the food's tolerance of radiation, handling conditions, i.e., packaging and stacking requirements, construction costs, financing arrangements, and other variables particular to the situation.<ref>(Forsythe and Evangel 1993, USDA 1989)</ref> Irradiation is a capital-intensive technology requiring a substantial initial investment, ranging from $1&nbsp;million to $5&nbsp;million. In the case of large research or contract irradiation facilities, major capital costs include a radiation source (cobalt-60), hardware (irradiator, totes and conveyors, control systems, and other auxiliary equipment), land (1 to 1.5&nbsp;acres), radiation shield, and warehouse. Operating costs include salaries (for fixed and variable labor), utilities, maintenance, taxes/insurance, cobalt-60 replenishment, general utilities, and miscellaneous operating costs.<ref>(Kunstadt et al., USDA 1989)</ref><ref name="ozone">[http://www.epa.gov/Ozone/mbr/casestudies/volume2/irad2.html The Use of Irradiation for Post-Harvest and Quarantine Commodity Control | Ozone Depletion&nbsp;– Regulatory Programs | U.S. EPA]</ref>

Treatment costs vary as a function of dose and facility usage. Low dose applications such as disinfestation of fruit range between US$0.01/lbs and US$0.08/lbs while higher dose applications can cost as much as US$0.20/lbs.<ref name="ozone"/>

Opponents of food irradiation sometimes state that large-scale irradiation would increase processing, transportation, and handling times for fruits and vegetables thus contributing to a negative ecological balance compared to locally grown foods.

===Dosimetry===
"Dose" (short for ''radiation absorbed dose'') is the physical quantity governing the radiation processing of food, relating to the beneficial effects to be achieved. It is measured in the [[SI unit]] known as the [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy).  One gray of radiation is equal to 1 joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of food material.  In radiation processing of foods, the doses are generally measured in kilograys (kGy, 1,000 Gy).

The measurement of radiation dose is referred to as [[dosimetry]] and involves exposing [[dosimeter]]s jointly with the treated food item.<ref>[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/pdf/TRS409_scr.pdf anon., Dosimetry for Food Irradiation, IAEA, Vienna, 2002, Technical Reports Series No. 409]</ref><ref>K. Mehta, Radiation Processing Dosimetry&nbsp;– A practical manual, 2006, GEX Corporation, Centennial, USA</ref>  Dosimeters are small components attached to the irradiated product made of materials that, when exposed to [[ionizing radiation]], change specific, measurable physical attributes to a degree that can be correlated to the dose received.  Modern dosimeters are made of a range of materials, such as alanine pellets, perspex ([[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]]) blocks, and radiochromic films, as well as special solutions and other materials.  These dosimeters are used in combination with specialized read out devices.  Standards that describe calibration and operation for radiation dosimetry, as well as procedures to relate the measured dose to the effects achieved and to report and document such results, are maintained by the [[American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM international) and are also available as ISO/ASTM standards.<ref>(see Annual Book of ASTM Standards, vol. 12.02, West Conshohocken, PA, USA)</ref>

On the basis of the dose of radiation the application is generally divided into three main categories:

====Low dose applications (up to 1 kGy)====
*Sprout inhibition in bulbs and tubers 0.03-0.15 kGy
*Delay in fruit ripening 0.25-0.75 kGy
*Insect disinfestation including quarantine treatment and elimination of food borne parasites 0.07-1.00 kGy

====Medium dose applications (1 kGy to 10 kGy)====
*Reduction of spoilage microbes to prolong shelf-life of meat, poultry and seafoods under refrigeration 1.50–3.00 kGy
*Reduction of pathogenic microbes in fresh and frozen meat, poultry and seafoods 3.00–7.00 kGy
*Reducing the number of microorganisms in spices to improve hygienic quality 10.00 kGy

====High dose applications (above 10 kGy)====
These doses are above those currently permitted in the USA for commercial food items by the FDA and other regulators around the world.<ref>http://nucleus.iaea.org/ifa/</ref> The European Union countries allow dried herbs and spices to be irradiated to a maximum dose of 15 kGy which is equal to an "overall average dose" of 10 kGy as defiend under EU Directives (i.e. at the maximum dose uniformity ratio (maximum dose / minimum dose) of 3 allowed in the EU and using the relationship that "overall average dose" for dried herbs and spices is equal to the average of the sum of the maximum dose and minimum dose).<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1999L0002:20031120:EN:PDF ''Annex III of Directive 1999/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 February 1999 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning foods and food ingredients treated with ionising radiation (OJ L 66, 13.3.1999, p. 16)''.]</ref>
Though these doses are approved for non commercial applications, such as sterilizing frozen meat for [[NASA]] [[astronauts]] (doses of 44 kGy)<ref>[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/opa-fdir.html U. S.

* Sterilization of packaged meat, poultry, and their products that are shelf stable without refrigeration 25.00-70.00 kGy

== Public Impact, Opinion, and Safety==
Irradiation has not been widely adopted due to an asserted negative public perception, the concerns expressed by some consumer groups and the reluctance of many food producers.<ref>Martin, Andrew. [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/business/02irradiate.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1261545694-KGCNC1z9SSW95acAk0gz0g Spinach and Peanuts, With a Dash of Radiation.] ''[[New York Times]].'' February 1, 2009.</ref>
Consumer perception of foods treated with irradiation is more negative than those processed by other means. "People think the product is radioactive," said Harlan Clemmons, president of Sadex, a food irradiation company based in Sioux City, Iowa.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/health/policy/22spinach.html?ex=1377144000&en=4d87f8791e3baa62&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink Harris, Gardinier, "F.D.A. Allows Irradiation of Some Produce", ''The New York Times'', August 22, 2008.]</ref>

Consumer organizations, environmentalist groups, and opponents to food irradiation refer to some studies suggesting that a large part of the public questions the safety of irradiated foods, and will not buy foods that have been irradiated.<ref name="Choice">Food Marketing Institute poll 2000</ref>{{verification needed|date=November 2012}}

On the other hand, other studies indicate the number of consumers concerned about the safety of irradiated food has decreased in the last 10 years and continues to be less than the number of those concerned about pesticide residues, microbiological contamination, and other food related concerns. Such numbers are comparable to those of people with no concern about food additives and preservatives. Consumers, given a choice and access to irradiated products, appear ready to buy it in considerably large numbers.<ref>Consumer Attitudes and Market Response to Irradiated Food, Author: Bruhn, Christine M.1 Journal of Food Protection, Volume 58, Number 2, February 1995, pp. 175–181(7), Publisher: International Association for Food Protection</ref><ref>Conley, S.T., What do consumers think about irradiated foods, FSIS Food Safety Review (Fall 1992), 11-15</ref>

=== Labeling ===
Labeling laws differ from country to country. While [[Codex Alimentarius]] represents the global standard in particular under the WTO-agreement, member states are free to convert those standards into national regulations. With regard to labeling of irradiated food, detailed rules are published at CODEX-STAN&nbsp;– 1 (2005) labelling of prepacked food.<ref name="CX-label">[http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/32/CXS_001e.pdf ''GENERAL STANDARD FOR THE LABELLING OF PREPACKAGED FOODS''. CODEX STAN 1-1985.]</ref>

====US Labeling====
[[Image:Radura-Symbol.svg|thumb|150px|right|The [[Radura]] logo, as required by U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations to show a food has been treated with ionizing radiation.]]
The US defines irradiated foods as foods in which the irradiation causes a material change in the food, or a material change in the consequences that may result from the use of the food. This definition does not include foods where one of the ingredients is irradiated.  This definition is not consistent with the [[Codex Alimentarius]]. All irradiated foods must bear the [[Radura]] symbol at the point of sale and the term "irradiated" or a derivative there of, in conjunction with explicit language describing the change in the food or its conditions of use.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=179&showFR=1</ref>  

The meaning of the label is not consistent as the amount of irradiation used can vary and the FDA regulations are on a product by product basis. The amount of pathogens affected by irradiation can vary as well.

Food that is processed as an ingredient by a restaurant or food processor is exempt from the labeling requirement in the US.

The Radura logo as regulated by FDA is slightly different from the international version as proposed in Codex Alimentarius.<ref name="CX-label"/>

====EU Labeling====
The European union follows the Alimentarius provision to label irradiated ingredients down to the last molecule. However, there is no option provided to use the RADURA-logo (what would not exclude to use this logo voluntarily). The European Union is particularly strict in enforcing irradiation labeling requiring its member countries to perform tests on a cross section of food items in the market-place and to report to the European Commission; the results are published annually in the OJ of the European Communities.<ref name="FDA">http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/scientific_advices_reports_en.htm
 Expand "Food Irradiation Reports" and select respective annual report and language</ref>

=== Irradiated Food Supply===
There are analytical methods available to detect the usage of irradiation on food items in the marketplace.<ref>McMurray, C.H., Gray, R., Stewart, E.M., Pearce, J., Detection methods for irradiated foods, Royal Society of Chemistry; Cambridge (GB); 1996</ref><ref>Raffi, J., Delincée, H., Marchioni, E., Hasselmann, C., Sjöberg, A.-M., Leonardi, M., Kent, M., Bögl, K.-W., Schreiber, G., Stevenson, H., Meier, W., Concerted action of the community bureau of reference on methods of identification of irradiated foods; bcr information; European Commission; Luxembourg; 1994, 119 p.; EUR--15261</ref><ref>[http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/377/CXS_231e.pdf General Codex Methods for the Detection of Irradiated Foods, CODEX STAN 231-2001, Rev.1 2003]</ref> This may be understood as a tool for government authorities to enforce existing labeling standards and to bolster consumer confidence.

Currently, there is no global trade in irradiated food, except a rather small quantity of fruit irradiated to eliminate insect pests and to fulfill the US quarantine requirements.

==== United States Irradiated Food Supply====

Certain supermarkets prefer not to carry irradiated products for reasons of consumer perception.

Mexico may become the largest exporter of irradiated produce to the U.S. at this point. Varieties will include Mango, Sweet citrus, Manzano Pepper, Starfruit, Guava according to the current US / Mexico irradiation work plan. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==== European Union Irradiated Food Supply====
Irradiated foods produced within the EU that fall within the single category; 'dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings' are permitted presently in all 27 member states of the European Community.<ref>http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2012:020:0006:0009:EN:PDF</ref> Though imports into the EC are possible from third countries and the seven countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, United Kingdom) that allow other<ref>http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:283:0005:0005:EN:PDF</ref> irradiated foods to be marketed as long as they comply with Directive 1999/2/EC.

The controls on food irradiation, and in particular the strict labeling requirements are regarded by many as restrictive. It is rare to find irradiated and clearly labelled food items on sale. The European Union's official site gives information on the regulatory status of food irradiation, the quantities of foods irradiated at authorized facilities in European Union member states and the results of market surveillance where foods have been tested to see if they are irradiated. The Official Journal of the European Union publishes annual reports on food irradiation, the current report <ref>http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/docs/annual_report_2010_en.pdf</ref> covers the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010 and compiles information from 27 Member States.

In total, 9263.4 tonnes of food products were irradiated in European Union countries in 2010; mainly in three member state countries: Belgium (63%), the Netherlands (17%) and France (11%). The three types of foods irradiated the most were frog legs (48%), poultry (23%) and dried herbs and spices (16%).

A series of fatal cat incidences with irradiated pet food<ref>[http://www.foodmag.com.au/news/petfood-recall-prompted-by-cat-deaths Food Magazine. News. November 24, 2008. ''Petfood recall prompted by cat deaths''.]. Retrieved April 29, 2013.</ref> in Australia led the cat food company responsible to recall any product from the market. Irradiation at elevated doses or heat sterilization was compulsory at the time of this incident. The company and several scientist speculated this might have been caused by Vitamin A depletion. Over 40 cats were reported to have been euthanized after severe paralysis subsequent to being fed a particular brand of cat food.<ref name="VD"/>

There is consensus in the scientific community that the problem was specific to the lot, not the irradiation process because:

Child et al., Ataxia and paralysis in cats in Australia associated with exposure to an impported gamma-irradiated commercial dry pet food, Australian Veterinary Journal 87(2009)no.9, 349-351</ref>

* The series of incidents was linked only to a single batch of the brand's product and no illness was linked to any of that brand's other irradiated batches of the same product or to any other brand of irradiated cat food,

* There was no evidence of Vitamin A depletion in any of the cats studied, although there were not enough cats sampled to prove conclusively that there where no cases of Vitamin A depletion.

* [[Histopathology|Histopathological]] damage to the white matter of spinal cord and brain was seen. No gross abnormalities were found during postmortem examination. The report by the Australian Veterinary Journal states that there is no known mechanism by which changes induced in foods by irradiation could result in this kind of damage.

Radiation processing of imported cat food has now been banned in Australia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/catfood-irradiation-banned-as-pet-theory-proved-20090529-bq8h.html |title=Cat-food irradiation banned as pet theory proved |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=May 30, 2009 |accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref> The AQIS announced on June 6, 2009 that the alternative of radiation processing for cat food is no longer acceptable and that irradiated dog food is required to be labeled "Must not be fed to cats".<ref>http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/import/general-info/ian/09/33-2009</ref><ref>http://www.daff.gov.au/__data/assets/word_doc/0005/1032935/7-2009.doc</ref> 

Since 2009, no study has been published contributing to clearing-up this issue.

=== Safety, security and wholesomeness aspects ===
Hundreds of animal feeding studies of irradiated food, including multigenerational studies, have been performed since 1950.<ref name="JFDiehl">Diehl, J.F., Safety of irradiated foods, Marcel Dekker, N.Y., 1995 (2. ed.)</ref> Endpoints investigated have included subchronic and chronic changes in metabolism, histopathology, and function of most systems; reproductive effects; growth; teratogenicity; and mutagenicity. A large number of studies have been performed; meta-studies have supported the safety of irradiated food.<ref name="JECFI">World Health Organization. Wholesomeness of irradiated food. Geneva, Technical Report Series No. 659, 1981</ref><ref name="JSGHDI">World Health Organization. High-Dose Irradiation: Wholesomeness of Food Irradiated With Doses Above 10 kGy. Report of a Joint FAO/IAEA/WHO Study Group. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization; 1999. WHO Technical Report Series No. 890</ref><ref name="JFDiehl"/><ref name=WHO1994">World Health Organization. Safety and Nutritional Adequacy of Irradiated Food. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization; 1994</ref><ref>US Department of Health, and Human Services, Food, and Drug Administration Irradiation in the production, processing, and handling of food. Federal Register 1986; 51:13376-13399</ref>

Processing of food by ionizing radiation causes a multitude of chemical changes. This is the cause why it is so effective in inducing beneficial modifications. For comparison, cooking, smoking, salting etc. as traditional techniques cause even changes in the identity of a food and result in a new product; in some cases (green beans) cooking even removes a toxic compound. Even leaving alone would induce dramatic chemical changes leading finally to deterioration and spoilage of such food. Considering food irradiation it is undisputable that many chemical changes occur, and from the beginning of the research into this method the innocuity of newly formed compounds was a main topic. The results, the state of the art, and the mainstream of science are that irradiated food in general is safe to consume.<ref name="JFDiehl"/> Several national expert groups came to the same result; on top of all two international expert groups have in full detail evaluated the available data and finally concluded that any food at any dose is wholesome and safe to consume as long as it remains palatable and maintains its technical properties.<ref name="JECFI"/><ref name="JSGHDI"/> In other words, as a steak burned to coal has lost its sensory and meat properties any over-irradiated food item will lose all of its desirable properties; the radiation doses to cause toxic changes are much higher than the doses needed to accomplish the benefits of irradiation.

===Criticism and concerns about food irradiation===
Concerns have been expressed by public interest groups and public health experts that irradiation, as a non-preventive measure, might disguise or otherwise divert attention away from poor working conditions, sanitation, and poor food-handling procedures that lead to [[contamination]] in the first place.<ref>http://www.organicconsumers.org/Irrad/irradfact.cfm</ref>

Consumer advocacy groups such as [[Public Citizen]] or [[Food and Water Watch]] maintain that the safety of irradiated food is not proven, in particular long-term studies are still lacking, and strongly oppose the use of the technology.<ref name="PC">[http://www.citizen.org/documents/opposeradfood.pdf Public Citizen | Energy Program | Energy Program&nbsp;– Why Oppose Food Irradiation?]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/food/foodirradiation/food-irradiation |title=Food Irradiation - Food & Water Watch &#124; Food & Water Watch |publisher=Foodandwaterwatch.org |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref>

Concerns and objections include the possibility that food irradiation ''might'' do any of the following:

* Mask spoiled food
* Discourage strict adherence to good manufacturing practices
* Preferentially kill "good" bacteria and encourage growth of "bad" bacteria
* Devitalize and denature irradiated food
* Impair flavor
* Not destroy bacterial toxins already present
* Cause chemical changes that are harmful to the consumer
* Be unnecessary in today's food system<ref name="Satin">Satin, M., Food irradiation, Technomic, Lancaster, 1996 (2. ed.)</ref>

Processors of irradiated food are subject to all existing regulations, inspections, and potential penalties regarding plant safety and sanitation; including fines, recalls, and criminal prosecutions.  But critics of the practice claim that a lack of regulatory oversight (such as regular food processing plant inspections) necessitates irradiation.<ref>[http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/zapped Hauter, W. and Worth, M., ''Zapped! Irradiation and the Death of Food'', Food & Water Watch Press, Washington, DC, 2008.]</ref>

While food irradiation can in some cases maintain the quality (i.e. general appearance and "inner" quality) of certain perishable food for a longer period of time, it cannot undo spoilage that occurred prior to irradiation. Irradiation cannot successfully be used to mask quality issues other than pathogens. As with heat pasteurization (for example, milk), processing by ionizing radiation can contribute to eliminate pathogen risks from solid food (example meat or lettuce).<ref name="Satin"/> For comparison, milk heat pasteurization is not being alleged to be a method "to cover up poor food quality"; consequently, food irradiation should not be accused to serve such criminal purposes. Under a HACCP-concept ([[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point]]) radiation processing can serve and contribute as an ultimate critical control point before the food reaches the consumer.

Opponents of food irradiation and consumer activists argue that the final proof is missing that irradiated food is "safe" (i.e. not unwholesome) and that the lack of long-term studies should be a further reason not to permit food irradiation.<ref>R.L. Wolke, What Einstein told his cook&nbsp;– Kitchen science explained, W.W. Norton & Company Inc., New York, 2002; see p.310 "Some Illumination on Irradiation"</ref> Opponents also refer to a number of scientific publications reporting significant negative effects of irradiated food, for example

*[[Polyploidy]] in malnourished Indian children
*Increase of [[aflatoxin]] production by irradiated microorganisms
*Vitamin deficiencies at extremely high doses to the complete diet
*Non-vitamin effects at higher doses (free radicals?)
*Change in [[chronaxie]] in rats
	 
However, those experiments could be either not verified in later experiments, could not be clearly attributed to the radiation effect, or could be attributed to an inappropriate design of the experiment etc.<ref name="JFDiehl"/>

===Alternative methods===
Other methods to reduce several pathogens in food include heat-[[pasteurization]], [[ultra-high temperature processing]], [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|UV irradiation]], [[ozone]], [[Pascalization]], [[Thermization]] or fumigation with [[ethylene oxide]].

For quarantine purposes, insect pests can also be eliminated by fumigation with [[methyl bromide]] or aluminium phosphine, vapour heat, forced hot air, hot water dipping, or cold treatment.

Other methods to extend shelf life of food items include [[modified atmosphere packaging]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[dehydration]], vacuum packaging, [[freezing]] and [[flash freezing]] as well as chemical additives.

Opponents of food irradiation and some consumer activists (for example Public Citizen<ref name="PC"/>) maintain that the best alternative to food irradiation to reduce pathogens is in good agricultural practices. Farmers and processing plants should improve sanitation practices, water used for irrigation and processing should be regularly tested for E. coli, and production plants should be routinely inspected. Concentrated animal feeding operations near farmland where produce is grown should be regulated.

Proponents of food irradiation have said that practices of organic farming can only reduce the extent of the microorganism load. They assert that residual flora including pathogen germs always persist, and that processing by ionizing radiation could be the ultimate measure (as a CCP under a HACCP-concept) to practically eliminate such risks.<ref>Osterholm, M.T. and Potter, M.E., Irradiation pasteurization of solid foods: Taking food safety to the next level, Emerging Infectious Diseases 3 (1997) No.4, 575-577</ref><ref>Bender, J.B., Smith, K.E., Hedberg, C., Osterholm, M.T., Food-borne disease in the 21st century. What challenges await us? Postgrad. Med. 106(1999) No.2, 109-112, 115-116, 119</ref><ref>Osterholm, M.T. and Norgan, A.P., The role of irradiation in food safety, N.Engl.J.Med. 350 (2004) No. 18, 1898–1901</ref>

==Regulation of Food Irradiation in Consumer Products==
The provisions are that any "first generation" product must be labeled "irradiated" as any product derived directly from an irradiated raw material; for ingredients the provision is that even the last molecule of an irradiated ingredient must be listed with the ingredients even in cases where the unirradiated ingredient does not appear on the label. The RADURA-logo is optional; several countries use a graphical version that differs from the Codex-version.
There is not much information about irradiated food available to the consumer on the market place; a few more recent surveys do not reveal the full picture.<ref name="IMRP2006"/><ref name="Kume2009"/> It may be assumed that even international trade exists.

The United Nations [[Food and Agricultural Organization]] (FAO) has passed a motion to commit member states to implement irradiation technology for their national [[phytosanitary]] programs; the General assembly of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) has urged wider use of the irradiation technology.

=== United States Regulation===
Food irradiation in the United States is primarily regulated by the FDA<ref>FDA, Irradiation in the production, processing and handling of food. Final rule, Fed. Reg., 51: 13376-13399 (1986)
this is the initial and general ruling; later amendments on various details have been published in Fed. Reg.</ref> since it is considered a food additive. Other federal agencies that regulate aspects of food irradiation include:
* [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA):  Meat and poultry products, fresh fruit.<ref>USDA/FSIS and USDA/APHIS, various final rules on pork, poultry and fresh fruits: Fed.Reg. 51:1769–1771 (1986); 54:387-393 (1989); 57:43588-43600 (1992); and others more</ref>
* [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC):  Safety of the processing facility.
* [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT):  Safe transport of the radioactive sources.

Each new food is approved separately with a guideline specifying a maximum dosage; in case of quarantine applications the minimum dose is regulated. Packaging materials containing the food processed by irradiation must also undergo approval.

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has approved the use of low-level irradiation as an alternative treatment to pesticides for fruits and vegetables that are considered hosts to a number of insect pests, including fruit flies and seed weevils; the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has cleared among a number of other applications the treatment of hamburger patties to eliminate the residual risk of a contamination by a virulent E. coli.

Under bilateral agreements that allows less-developed countries to earn income through food exports agreements are made to allow them to irradiate fruits and vegetables at low doses to kill insects, so that the food can avoid quarantine.

=== European Union Regulation===
The [[European Union]] has established a framework for regulating the processing of food by the application of ionizing radiation by specific [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] since 1999; the "Framework" Directive and the "Implementing" Directive and relevant documents and reports are accessible online.<ref name="EUregulation">EU: Food Irradiation&nbsp;– Community Legislation http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/comm_legisl_en.htm</ref>
The "implementing" directive contains a "positive list" permitting irradiation of only dried aromatic herbs, spices, and vegetable seasonings to a "maximum overall average absorbed radiation dose" of 10 kGy, with no maximum dose specified.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1999:066:0024:0025:EN:PDF Official Journal of the European Communities. March 13, 1999. ''Directive 1999/3/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 22, 1999 on the establishment of a Community list of foods and food ingredients treated with ionising radiation'']</ref>
However, any Member State is permitted to maintain previously granted clearances or to add new clearance as granted in other Member States, in the case the EC's Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) has given a positive vote for the respective application. Presently, seven Member States (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, United Kingdom) have adopted such provisions.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:283:0005:0005:EN:PDF Official Journal of the European Communities. 24 November, 2009. ''List of Member States' authorisations of food and food ingredients which may be treated with ionising radiation.'']</ref> The food irradiation Directives intentionally exclude the irradiation of foodstuffs prepared for patients requiring sterile diets under medical supervision and it is possible to irradiate any type of such food for these patients. 

It is because of the "[[Single Market]]" of the EC that any food&nbsp;– even if irradiated&nbsp;– must be allowed to be marketed in any other Member State even if a general ban of food irradiation prevails, under the condition that the food has been irradiated legally in the state of origin.
Furthermore, imports into the EC are possible from third countries if the irradiation facility had been inspected and approved by the EC and the treatment is legal within the EC or some Member state.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:287:0040:0041:EN:PDF Official Journal of the European Communities. 23 October 2002. ''COMMISSION DECISION of 23 October 2004 adopting the list of approved facilities in third countries for the irradiation of foods.'']</ref><ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2004/l_314/l_31420041013en00140015.pdf Official Journal of the European Communities. October 13, 2004. ''COMMISSION DECISION of October 7, 2004 amending Decision 2002/840/EC adopting the list of approved facilities in third countries for the irradiation of foods.'']</ref><ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2007/l_323/l_32320071208en00400041.pdf Official Journal of the European Communities. 23 October 2007.

The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) of the EC has given a positive vote on eight categories of food to be irradiated.<ref>[http://eu.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/scf_reports_18.pdf Scientific Committee on Food. Report 18.]</ref> However, in a compromise between the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Commission]], only dried aromatic herbs, spices, and vegetable seasonings can be found in the positive list. The European Commission was due to provide a final draft for the positive list by the end of 2000; however, this failed because of a veto from Germany and a few other Member States. In 1992,<ref>[http://eu.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/scf_reports_31.pdf Scientific Committee on Food. Report 31.]</ref> and in 1998<ref>[http://eu.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out15_en.html Scientific Committee on Food. 15.]</ref> the SCF voted "positive" on a number of irradiation applications that had been allowed in some member states before the EC Directives came into force, to enable those member states to maintain their national authorizations.

In 2003, the [[Codex Alimentarius]] removed any upper dose limit for food irradiation and at the same time stopped using the term "overall average dose" (instead referring to maximum dose and minimum dose), the SCF adopted a "revised opinion",<ref>[http://eu.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out193_en.pdf Scientific Committee on Food. Revised opinion #193.]</ref> but, in fact, it did not understand that the concept of "overall average dose" had been replaced, and SCF revised opinion was a re-confirmation and endorsement of the 1986 opinion. The opinion denied cancellation of the upper dose limit, and required that before the actual list of individual items or food classes (as in the opinions expressed in 1986, 1992 and 1998) can be expanded, new individual studies into the toxicology of each of such food and for each of the proposed dose ranges are requested. The SCF has subsequently been replaced by the new [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA). In April 2011, EFSA’s experts updated their scientific advice on the safety of food irradiation. In its comprehensive advice to EU policy makers, The EFSA BIOHAZ Panel looked at the efficacy and microbiological safety of the process, and the CEF Panel looked at possible risks arising from the formation of chemical substances as a result of food irradiation. A summary of their findings and recommendations,<ref>[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2107.pdf Statement summarising the Conclusions and Recommendations from the Opinions on the Safety of Irradiation of Food adopted by the BIOHAZ and CEF Panels.]</ref> was published, as were two detailed reports; one on the chemical safety,<ref>[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/1930.pdf Scientific Opinion on the Chemical Safety of Irradiation of Food.]</ref> of food irradiation and the other on the efficacy and microbiological safety,<ref>[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2103.pdf Scientific Opinion on the efficacy and microbiological safety of irradiation of food.]</ref> of food irradiation.

=== Other and international Regulation===
Other countries, including New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, India, and Mexico, have permitted the irradiation of fresh fruits for [[Drosophilidae|fruit fly]] quarantine purposes, amongst others. Such countries as Pakistan and Brazil have adopted the Codex Alimentarius Standard on Irradiated Food without any reservation or restriction: i.e., any food may be irradiated to any dose.
