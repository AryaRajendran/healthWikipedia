'''Medically unexplained physical symptoms''' ('''MUPS''') or '''medically unexplained symptoms''' ('''MUS''') are patient symptoms for which the treating physician, other healthcare providers, and research scientists have found no medical cause. The term does not necessarily imply that a physical cause does not exist, but rather notes that cause(s) for given symptoms are uncertain, unknown or disputed—there is no [[scientific consensus]]. A task force of the US [[National Institutes of Health]] states, "Medically unexplained syndromes (MUS) present the most common problems in medicine."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Stress: The Brain-Body Connection|last=Hellhammer|first=Dirk H|isbn=3-8055-8295-1}}</ref>

==History and usage==
MUPS may be synonymous with [[somatization disorder]]<ref name="pmid10489969"/> or [[psychosomatic illness]], where the cause or perception of symptoms is mental in origin, or may overlap these terms or be a "lower threshold variant" of them.<ref name=KroenkeK/> Because several definitions of both somatization and MUPS exist, and the usage of both terms is inconsistent in medical literature and practice, MUPS is sometimes used interchangeably with [[somatization]] and functional [[somatic symptoms]],<ref name="pmid16025867">{{cite journal |author=Rosendal M, Fink P, Bro F, Olesen F|title=Somatization, heartsink patients, or functional somatic symptoms? Towards a clinical useful classification in primary health care |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |year=2005 |pmid=16025867 }}</ref> although "somatised mental distress" and "somatisation disorders" (based on symptom counts) may not adequately account for most patients seen with MUPS.<ref name="PMD14694702"/>

A study of terms related to MUPS found that patients often object to the phrase "medically unexplained." The study revealed differences between patients' and doctors' opinions. For example, patients preferred terms using the word "functional" although doctors felt this word was potentially offensive.<ref>{{cite pmid|12493661}}</ref>

When a cause for MUS is found, the symptom(s) are no longer medically unexplained. Some cases of [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]] and [[dyspepsia]] were considered MUS until bacterial infections were found to be their cause.<ref>{{Cite pmid|15730130}}</ref>

==Contested causation==
The lack of known [[etiology]] in MUPS cases can lead to conflict between patient and health-care provider over the diagnosis and treatment of MUPS.  This conflict can occur in the public arena and may involve media controversy, advocacy groups, scientific and political debate and even legal proceedings.<ref name="engel2002">[http://www.ehponline.org/members/2002/suppl-4/641-647engel/engel-full.html Caring for Medically Unexplained Physical Symptoms after Toxic Environmental Exposures: Effects of Contested Causation] Engel, et al. Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol 110, Nu. S4, August 2002.</ref>

Diagnosis of MUPS is seldom a satisfactory situation for the patient, as many patients feel this implies it is "all in their head." This can lead to an adversarial [[doctor-patient relationship]],<ref name="engel2002"/> which can develop into an [[iatrogenic]] [[neurosis]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} thus complicating the situation. A 2008 review in the [[British Medical Journal]] stated that a doctor must be careful not to tell a patient that nothing is wrong, "as clearly this is not the case." The symptoms that brought the patient to the doctor are real, even when the cause is not known. The doctor should try to explain the symptoms, avoid blaming the patient for them, and work with the patient to develop a symptom management plan.<ref>{{cite pmid|18483055}}</ref>

According to psychiatrist [[Simon Wessely]], "Various names have been given to medically unexplained symptoms. These include somatisation, somatoform disorders and functional somatic symptoms."<ref name="pmid10489969">{{cite journal |author=Wessely S, Nimnuan C, Sharpe M |title=Functional somatic syndromes: one or many? |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9182 |pages=936–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10489969 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)08320-2 }}</ref> He writes that "a substantial overlap exists between the individual syndromes and that the similarities between them outweigh the differences." In reply, the psychiatrist Peter White has stated that "the concept of a general functional somatic syndrome is unhelpful in understanding illness, aetiology, treatment and outcome".<ref>Wessely S, White PD. There is only one functional somatic syndrome. Br J Psychiatry. 2004 Aug;185:95-6. PMID 15286058 [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/185/2/95]</ref> In another publication, Wessely states that providing a label for a set of symptoms "is not a neutral act, since specific labels are associated with specific beliefs and attitudes," and "even when organic illness is certain, the illness label can result in adverse behaviour changes.", while there is conflicting evidence on whether such labelling is helpful.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Page LA, Wessely S | title = Medically unexplained symptoms: exacerbating factors in the doctor-patient encounter. | journal = J R Soc Med | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 223–7 | year = 2003 | month = May | pmid = 12724431 | url = http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/content/full/96/5/223 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.96.5.223 | pmc = 539474}}</ref>

Luxembourg et al.<ref>Toni Luxenberg, PsyD, Joseph Spinazzola, PhD, Jose Hidalgo, MD, Cheryl Hunt, PsyD, and Bessel A. van der Kolk, MD. (2001). "[http://www.aisjca-mft.org/DESNOS.pdf Complex Trauma and Disorders of Extreme Stress (DESNOS) Diagnosis, Part One: Assessment]"''Directions in Psychiatry'', Vol 21.</ref> write that a substantial portion of MUPS and associated [[somatoform disorder]]s have a clearly-identified cause: repeated psychological traumas, particularly during childhood. Evidence indicates that repeated abuse or other traumas often leads to disturbed [[lymphatic system]] functioning, under-production of [[cortisol]] and overproduction of [[Endogenous_opioid#Endogenous_opioids|endogenous opioid]]s, all of which can contribute to MUPS. Those who were seriously traumatized on three or more occasions during childhood were substantially more likely than a control group to develop such difficult-to-treat MUPS as chronic headaches, pelvic pain, and seizures. Trauma researcher [[Bessel van der Kolk]]<ref>van der Kolk BA. The complexity of adaptation to trauma:

''Traumatic Stress: The Effects of Overwhelming Experience on Mind, Body, and Society''. New York: Guilford Press; 1996; 182–213.</ref> has noted that chronically abused persons sometimes report a baffling array of MUPS while simultaneously reporting none of the expected psychological distress related to their abuse; he further suggests that, due to severe [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], chronic physical symptoms are these people's only means of expressing what would otherwise be overwhelming emotional pain.

==Treatment==
The most effective current treatment for some medically unexplained symptoms is a combination of therapeutic approaches tailored to the individual patient. Most MUS patients are in need of psychotherapy, relaxation therapy and physiotherapy under medical supervision. A Combined therapeutic approach which is at least twice as effective as other therapeutic modalities published to date is described in Steele RE ''et al.'' "A novel and effective treatment modality for medically unexplained symptoms" <ref>Steele RE, de Leeuw E, Carpenter D. "A novel and effective treatment modality for medically unexplained symptoms" J Pain Management 2009 1(4):201-212.</ref> The next best documented approach is [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), with evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials.<ref name=KroenkeK>{{cite journal |author=Kroenke K |title=Efficacy of treatment for somatoform disorders: a review of randomized controlled trials |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=881–8 |year=2007 |pmid=18040099 |doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e31815b00c4}}</ref><ref>Woolfolk RL, Allen LA, Tiu JE, "New directions in the treatment of somatization" Psychiatr Clin North Am. 2007 Dec;30(4):621-44</ref> [[Antidepressants]] may also help, but the evidence is "not yet conclusive."<ref name=KroenkeK/> The effectiveness of CBT and antidepressants has not been studied for all medically unexplained symptoms, however. Evidence for a positive effect of CBT has been found in trials for [[fibromyalgia]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]], unexplained headaches, unexplained back [[pain]], [[tinnitus]], and non-cardiac chest pain.<ref name=JacksonReview/> As of 2006, CBT had not been tested for menopausal syndrome, chronic facial pain, [[Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome|interstitial cystitis]], or [[chronic pelvic pain]].<ref name=JacksonReview/>

For antidepressants, both [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs) have been tested for some medically unexplained symptoms. TCAs have effects on IBS, fibromyalgia, back pain, headaches, and possibly tinnitus, and single studies show a possible effect in chronic facial pain, non-cardiac chest pain, and interstitial cystitis. SSRIs are usually not effective or have only a weak effect. One exception is menopausal syndrome, where SSRIs are "possibly effective" as well as a third class of antidepressants, the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).<ref name=JacksonReview>{{cite journal |author=Jackson JL, O'Malley PG, Kroenke K |title=Antidepressants and cognitive-behavioral therapy for symptom syndromes |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=212–22 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16575378 |doi= |url= http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=417}}</ref>
