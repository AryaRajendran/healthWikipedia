'''Search and rescue in the United States''' involves a wide range of organizations that have [[search and rescue]] responsibilities.

In January 2008, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) released the [[National Response Framework]] (NRF) which, serves as the guiding document for a federal response during a national emergency.  In addition to the NRF there are 15 annexes relating to Emergency Support Functions (ESF) which, includes other federal agencies that contain resources or expertise to support an emergency.  Search and Rescue is included as ESF-9 and divides SAR into 4 primary elements, while assigning a federal agency with the lead role for each of the 4 elements.<ref>[http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nrf/nrf-annexes-all.pdf, Section ESF #9-1]</ref>
* Structural Collapse-USAR: [[Department of Homeland Security]] [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]
* Waterborne: [[United States Coast Guard]], [[United States Coast Guard Auxiliary]]
* Inland-wilderness: [[United States Department of Interior]], [[National Park Service]]
* Aeronautical: [[United States Air Force]] [[Air Force Rescue Coordination Center|Rescue Coordination Center]], [[Civil Air Patrol]], [[United States Air Force]] [[Air Rescue Service|Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service]], [[US Navy]] (secondary missions for helicopter squadrons)

In the [[United States|US]] SAR standards are developed primarily by [[ASTM International]] and the [[United States|US]] [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] which are then used by organizations such as the Mountain Rescue Association (MRA), the [[United States|US]] National Association of Search and Rescue (NASAR), and the [[United States|US]] [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] to develop training that will meet or exceed those standards.<ref name="ASTM">{{cite web|url = http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/COMMIT/COMMITTEE/F32.htm?L+memberstore+ooef3203+1171348303|title = Committee F32 on Search and Rescue|accessdate = 2008-02-24|last = O'Toole|first = Thomas F.|authorlink = |year = undated}}</ref> Within [[ASTM International]], most standards of relevance to SAR are developed by Committee F32 on Search and Rescue. Formed in 1988, the committee had 85 current members and jurisdiction of 38 approved standards.<ref name="ASTM"/>

;Virginia
[[Virginia]] is one of the few states that benefits from a state-coordinated system of training and response under the [[Virginia Department of Emergency Management]] (VDEM).  Under Title 44 of the Code of Virginia, VDEM develops and maintains the [[Commonwealth of Virginia Emergency Operations Plan]] (COVEOP) that includes the ESF-9 Annex for Search and Rescue. Similar to the federal version of ESF-9 under the [[National Response Framework]] (NRF), VDEM divides SAR into 4 primary elements.  While VDEM functions as the lead for ESF-9, many agencies, departments and volunteer organizations routinely responds to and supports SAR operations in the Commonwealth of Virginia.<ref name="vae01">{{cite web|url = http://www.vaemergency.com|title = vaemergency.com|accessdate = 2009-05-10|last = Virginia Department of Emergency Management|authorlink = |year = 2009}}</ref><ref name="vae02">{{cite web|url = http://www.vaemergency.com/library/plans/index.cfm|title = Commonwealth of Virginia Emergency Operations Plan |accessdate = 2009-05-10|last = Virginia Department of Emergency Management|authorlink = |year = 2009}}</ref>
