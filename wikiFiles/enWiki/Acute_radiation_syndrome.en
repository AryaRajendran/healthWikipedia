'''Acute radiation syndrome''' ('''ARS'''), also known as '''radiation poisoning''', '''radiation sickness''' or '''radiation toxicity''', is a constellation of health effects which present within 24 hours of exposure to high amounts of [[ionizing radiation]]. They may last for several months.<ref name=Review10>{{cite journal |author=Donnelly EH, Nemhauser JB, Smith JM, ''et al.'' |title=Acute radiation syndrome: assessment and management |journal=South.

The onset and type of symptoms depends on the radiation exposure. Relatively smaller doses result in [[gastrointestinal]] effects such as nausea and vomiting and symptoms related to falling blood counts such as infection and bleeding. Relatively larger doses can result in neurological effects and rapid death. Treatment of acute radiation syndrome is generally supportive with blood transfusions and antibiotics.<ref name=Review10/>

Similar symptoms may appear months to years after exposure as [[chronic radiation syndrome]] when the dose rate is too low to cause the acute form.<ref name=Chronic95>{{cite journal |author=Reeves GI, Ainsworth EJ |title=Description of the chronic radiation syndrome in humans irradiated in the former Soviet Union |journal=Radiat. Res. |volume=142 |issue=2 |pages=242–3 |year=1995 |month=May |pmid=7724741 |doi= 10.2307/3579035|url=}}</ref> Radiation exposure can also increase the probability of developing some other diseases, mainly different types of [[radiation-induced cancer|cancer]]s. These diseases are sometimes referred to as radiation sickness, but they are never included in the term acute radiation syndrome.

==Signs and symptoms==
Classically acute radiation syndrome is divided into three main presentations: [[Haematopoiesis|hematopoietic]], [[gastrointestinal]] and [[neurological]]/[[vascular]]. These symptoms may or may not be preceded by a [[prodrome]].<ref name=Review10/> The speed of onset of symptoms is related to radiation exposure, with greater doses resulting in a shorter delay in symptom onset.<ref name=Review10/> These presentations presume whole-body exposure and many of them are markers which are not valid if the entire body has not been exposed. Each syndrome requires that the tissue showing the syndrome itself be exposed. The hematopoetic syndrome requires exposure of the areas of bone marrow actively forming blood elements (i.e., the pelvis and sternum in adults). The neurovascular symptoms require exposure of the brain. The gastrointestinal syndrome is not seen if the stomach and intestines are not exposed to radiation.  

#Hematopoietic. This syndrome is marked by a drop in the number of [[blood cells]], called [[aplastic anemia]]. This may result in infections due to low [[white blood cells]], bleeding due to low [[platelets]], and [[anemia]] due to low [[red blood cells]].<ref name=Review10/> These changes can be detected by blood tests after receiving a whole-body acute dose as low as 0.25 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]], though they might never be felt by the patient if the dose is below 1 Gy. Conventional trauma and burns resulting from a bomb blast are complicated by the poor wound healing caused by hematopoietic syndrome, increasing mortality. 
#Gastrointestinal. This syndrome often follows absorbed doses of 6–30&nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|Gy]] (600–3000&nbsp;[[rad (unit)|rad]]).<ref name=Review10/> [[Nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], and [[abdominal pain]] are usually seen within two hours. Vomiting in this time-frame is a marker for whole body exposures that are in the fatal range above 4 Gy. Without exotic treatment such as bone marrow transplant, death with this dose is common.<ref name=Review10/> The death is generally more due to infection than gastrointestinal dysfunction.
#Neurovascular. This syndrome typically occurs at absorbed doses greater than 30&nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|Gy]] (3000&nbsp;rad), though it may occur at 10&nbsp;Gy (1000 rad).<ref name=Review10/> It presents with neurological symptoms such as [[dizziness]], [[headache]], or [[decreased level of consciousness]], occurring within minutes to a few hours, and with an absence of vomiting. It is invariably fatal.<ref name=Review10/>

The prodrome (early symptoms) of ARS typically includes [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[headache]]s, fatigue, [[fever]] and short period of skin reddening.<ref name=Review10/> These symptoms may occur at radiation doses as low as 35&nbsp;rad (0.35&nbsp;Gy). These symptoms are common to many illnesses and may not, by themselves, indicate acute radiation sickness.<ref name=Review10/>

===Skin changes===
{{main|radiation burn}}

[[File:The patient's skin is burned in a pattern corresponding to the dark portions of a kimono - NARA - 519686.jpg|thumb|In a nuclear explosion, ARS may be accompanied by flash burns, as pictured above, due to [[thermal radiation]]]]
[[List_of_cutaneous_conditions#Ionizing_radiation-induced|Cutaneous radiation syndrome]] (CRS) refers to the skin symptoms of radiation exposure.<ref name="arsphysicianfactsheet" /> Within a few hours after irradiation, a transient and inconsistent [[erythema|redness]] (associated with [[itch]]ing) can occur. Then, a latent phase may occur and last from a few days up to several weeks, when intense reddening, [[blister]]ing, and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]] of the irradiated site are visible. In most cases, healing occurs by regenerative means; however, very large skin doses can cause permanent hair loss, damaged [[Sebaceous gland|sebaceous]] and [[sweat gland]]s, [[atrophy]], [[fibrosis]], decreased or increased skin pigmentation, and ulceration or [[necrosis]] of the exposed tissue.<ref name="arsphysicianfactsheet" /> Notably, as seen at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], when skin is irradiated with high energy [[beta particles]], moist [[desquamation]] and similar early effects can heal, only to be followed by the collapse of the dermal vascular system after two months, resulting in the loss of the full thickness of the exposed skin.<ref>The medical handling of skin lesions following high level accidental irradiation, IAEA Advisory Group Meeting, September 1987 Paris.</ref> This effect had been demonstrated previously with pig skin using high energy beta sources at the Churchil Hospital Research Institute, in [[Oxford, England|Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wells J et.al. |title=Non-Uniform Irrradiation of Skin: Critera for Limiting Non-Stochastic Effects |journal=Proceedings of the Third International Symposium of the Society for Radiological Protection _ Advances in Theory and Practice |isbn= 0-9508123-0-7 |volume=2 |pages=537–542 |year=1982}}</ref>

===Cancer===
{{main|radiation-induced cancer}}
According to the [[linear no-threshold model]], any exposure to ionizing radiation, even at doses too low to produce any symptoms of radiation sickness, can induce cancer due to cellular and genetic damage. Under the assumption, survivors of acute radiation syndrome face an increased risk developing cancer later in life. The probability of developing cancer is a linear function with respect to the [[effective radiation dose]]. In radiation-induced cancer, the speed at which the condition advances, the [[prognosis]], the degree of pain, and every other feature of the disease are not believed to be functions of the radiation dosage.  However, [[Linear no-threshold model#Controversy|some modern studies]] indicate that some low levels of radiation do not increase cancer risk at all, and that there may exist a threshold dosage of ionizing radiation below which should be considered safe. Nonetheless the 'no safe amount' assumption is the basis of US and most national regulatory policies regarding "man-made" sources of radiation.

==Cause==
[[File:Death by haematopoietic syndrome of radiation sickness- influence of dose rate.png|thumb|300px|Both dose and dose rate contribute to the severity of acute radiation syndrome]]
Radiation sickness is caused by exposure to a large dose of ionizing radiation (>~0.1 Gy) over a short period of time. (>~0.1 Gy/h) This might be the result of a [[nuclear explosion]], a [[criticality accident]], a [[radiotherapy]] accident as in [[Therac-25]], a [[solar flare]] during interplanetary travel, escape of radioactive waste as in the 1987 [[Goiânia accident]], human error in a nuclear reactor, or other possibilities. Acute radiation sickness due to ingestion of radioactive material is possible, but rare; examples include the 1987 contamination of [[Leide das Neves Ferreira]] and the 2006 [[poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko]]. <!--People who don't belong here: There were other ARS cases in the Goiânia accident, but not from ingestion. Eben Byers died of radiation-induced cancer in 1932, but his dose rate was too low to cause acute radiation syndrome. Byers may have experienced [[chronic radiation syndrome]], but that would be OR.-->

Alpha and beta radiation have low penetrating power and are unlikely to affect vital internal organs from outside the body. Any type of ionizing radiation can cause burns, but alpha and beta radiation can only do so if [[radioactive contamination]] or [[nuclear fallout]] is deposited on the individual's skin or clothing. Gamma and neutron radiation can travel much further distances and penetrate the body easily, so whole-body irradiation generally causes ARS before skin effects are evident. Local gamma irradiation can cause skin effects without any sickness. In the early twentieth century, radiographers would commonly calibrate their machines by irradiating their own hand and measuring the time to onset of [[erythema]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=William|first=C. Inkret|coauthors=Charles B. Meinhold, and John C. Taschner|title=A Brief History of Radiation Protection Standards|journal=Los Alamos Science|year=1995|issue=23|pages=116–123|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/00326631.pdf|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>

===Spaceflight===
During spaceflight, particularly flights beyond [[low Earth orbit]], astronauts are exposed to both [[galactic cosmic ray|galactic cosmic radiation]] (GCR) and [[Solar proton event|solar particle event]] (SPE) radiation.  Evidence indicates past SPE radiation levels which would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142 |title=Superflares could kill unprotected astronauts |publisher=New Scientist |date=21 March 2005 }}</ref> GCR levels which might lead to acute radiation poisoning are less well understood.<ref>{{cite book |author=National Research Council (U.S.).

==Pathophysiology==
The most commonly used predictor of acute radiation symptoms is the whole-body [[absorbed dose]]. Several related quantities, such as the [[equivalent dose]], [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]], and [[committed dose]], are used to gauge long-term stochastic biological effects such as cancer incidence, but they are not designed to evaluate acute radiation syndrome.<ref name="ICRP103">{{cite journal|title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection|journal=Annals of the ICRP|year=2007|volume=37|series=ICRP publication 103|issue=2-4|url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103|accessdate=17 May 2012|isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2}}</ref> To help avoid confusion between these quantities, absorbed dose is measured in units of [[gray (Gy)]] or [[rad (unit)|rad]], while the others are measured in [[sievert (Sv)]] or [[rem (unit)|rem]]. 1&nbsp;rad = 0.01&nbsp;Gy<ref name="remdefinition">''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', Revised ed., US DOD 1962, p. 579</ref>

In most of the acute exposure scenarios that lead to radiation sickness, the bulk of the radiation is external whole-body gamma, in which case the absorbed, equivalent and effective doses are all equal. There are exceptions, such as the [[Therac-25]] accidents and the 1958 [[Cecil Kelley criticality accident]], where the absorbed doses in Gy or rad are the only useful quantities.

[[Radiotherapy]] treatments are typically prescribed in terms of the local absorbed dose, which might be 60 Gy or higher. The dose is fractionated (about 2 Gy per day for curative treatment), which allows for the normal tissues to undergo **repair**, allowing it to tolerate a higher dose than would otherwise be expected.  The dose to the targeted tissue mass must be averaged over the entire body mass, most of which receives negligible radiation, to arrive at a whole-body absorbed dose that can be compared to the table above.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is typically made based on a history of significant radiation exposure and suitable clinical findings.<ref name=Review10/> An [[Complete blood count|absolute lymphocyte count]] can give a rough estimate of radiation exposure.<ref name=Review10/> Time from exposure to vomiting can also give estimates of exposure levels if they are less than 1000&nbsp;rad.<ref name=Review10/>

==Prevention==
{{See also|Radiation protection}}
The best prevention for radiation sickness is to minimize the exposure dose or to reduce the dose rate.

===Distance===
Increasing distance from the radiation source reduces the dose according to the [[inverse-square law]] for a point source.  Distance can sometimes be effectively increased by means as simple as handling a source with [[forceps]] rather than fingers. This could reduce [[erythema]] to the fingers, but the extra few cm distance from the body will give little protection from acute radiation syndrome.

===Time===
The longer that humans are subjected to radiation the larger the dose will be. The advice in the [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] manual entitled "[[Nuclear War Survival Skills]]" published by [[Cresson Kearny]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] was that if one needed to leave the shelter then this should be done as rapidly as possible to minimize exposure.

In chapter 12 he states that "''Quickly putting or dumping wastes outside is not hazardous once fallout is no longer being deposited. For example, assume the shelter is in an area of heavy fallout and the dose rate outside is 400 [ [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen (R)]] per hour ] enough to give a potentially fatal dose in about an hour to a person exposed in the open. If a person needs to be exposed for only 10 seconds to dump a bucket, in this 1/360th of an hour he will receive a dose of only about 1 R. Under war conditions, an additional 1-R dose is of little concern.''"

In peacetime, radiation workers are taught to work as quickly as possible when performing a task which exposes them to radiation. For instance, the recovery of a lost [[radiography]] source should be done as quickly as possible.

===Shielding===
Matter attenuates radiation in most cases, so placing any mass (e.g. lead, dirt, sandbags, vehicles) between humans and the source will reduce the radiation dose. This is not always the case, however; care should be taken when constructing shielding for a specific purpose. For example, although high atomic number materials are very effective in shielding [[photon]]s, using them to shield [[beta particle]]s may cause higher radiation exposure due to the production of [[bremsstrahlung]] x-rays, and hence low atomic number materials are recommended. Also, using material with a high [[neutron activation]] [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] to shield neutrons will result in the shielding material itself becoming radioactive and hence more dangerous than if it were not present.

===Reduction of incorporation into the human body===
Where [[radioactive contamination]] is present, a [[gas mask]], dust mask, or good hygiene practices may offer protection, depending on the nature of the contaminant. [[Potassium iodide]] (KI) tablets can reduce the risk of cancer in some situations, but they do not prevent acute radiation syndrome.

===Fractionation of dose===
If an intentional dose is broken up into a number of smaller doses, with time allowed for recovery between irradiations, the same total dose causes less [[cell death]]. Even without interruptions, a reduction in dose rate below 0.1 Gy/h also tends to reduce cell death.<ref name=ICRP103 /> This technique is routinely used in radiotherapy.

The human body contains many types of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and a human can be killed by the loss of a single type of cells in a vital organ. For many short term radiation deaths (3 days to 30 days), the loss of two important types of cells that are constantly being regenerated causes death. The loss of cells forming [[blood cells]] ([[bone marrow]]) and the cells in the digestive system ([[Intestinal villus|microvilli]] which form part of the wall of the [[intestines]]) is fatal.

==Management==
[[File:Death by haematopoietic syndrome of radiation sickness- influence of medical care.png|thumb|300px|Effect of medical care on acute radiation syndrome]]
Treatment is supportive with the use of [[antibiotics]], [[blood products]], [[colony stimulating factors]], and [[stem cell transplant]] as clinically indicated.<ref name=Review10/> Symptomatic measures may also be employed.<ref name=Review10/>

===Antimicrobials===
{{main|Treatment of infections after exposure to ionizing radiation}}

There is a direct relationship between the degree of the [[neutropenia]] that emerges after exposure to radiation and the increased risk of developing infection. Since there are no controlled studies of therapeutic intervention in humans, most of the current recommendations are based on animal research.

The [[Treatment of infections after accidental or hostile exposure to ionizing radiation|treatment]] of established or suspected infection following exposure to radiation (characterized by neutropenia and fever) is similar to the one used for other febrile neutropenic patients. However, important differences between the two conditions exist. Individuals that develop neutropenia after exposure to radiation are also susceptible to irradiation damage in other tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and central nervous system. These patients may require therapeutic interventions not needed in other types of neutropenic patients. The response of irradiated animals to antimicrobial therapy can be unpredictable, as was evident in experimental studies where metronidazole<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jac/33.1.63 |author=Brook I, Ledney GD |title=Effect of antimicrobial therapy on the gastrointestinal bacterial flora, infection and mortality in mice exposed to different doses of irradiation |journal=[[Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy]] |issn=1460-2091 |volume=33 |pages=63–74 |year=1994}}</ref> and pefloxacin<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patchen ML, Brook I, Elliott TB, Jackson WE |title=Adverse effects of pefloxacin in irradiated C3H/HeN mice:  correction with glucan therapy |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |issn=0066-4804 |volume=37 |issue=9 |pages=1882–9 |year=1993 |pmid=8239601 |pmc=188087}}</ref> therapies were detrimental.

Antimicrobials that reduce the number of the strict [[Anaerobic infection|anaerobic]] component of the gut flora (i.e., [[metronidazole]]) generally should not be given because they may enhance systemic infection by aerobic or facultative bacteria, thus facilitating mortality after irradiation.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09553008814551081 |author=Brook I, Walker RI, MacVittie TJ |title=Effect of antimicrobial therapy on the bowel flora and bacterial infection in irradiated mice |journal=International Journal of Radiation Biology |issn=1362-3095 |volume=53 |pages=709–18 |year=1988}}</ref>

An empirical regimen of antimicrobials should be chosen based on the pattern of bacterial susceptibility and nosocomial infections in the effected area and medical center and the degree of [[neutropenia]]. Broad-spectrum empirical therapy (see below for choices) with high doses of one or more antibiotics should be initiated at the onset of fever. These antimicrobials should be directed at the eradication of  Gram-negative aerobic bacilli ( i.e. Enterobacteriace, Pseudomonas ) that account for more than three-fourths of the isolates causing sepsis. Because aerobic and facultative Gram-positive bacteria (mostly alpha-hemolytic streptococci) cause [[sepsis]] in about a quarter of the victims, coverage for these organisms may also be needed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brook I, Ledney D |title=Quinolone therapy in the management of infection after irradiation |journal=[[Crit Rev Microbiol]] |year=1992 |pages=18235–46 }}</ref>

A standardized management plane of febrile, neutropenic patients must be devised in each institution or agency. Empirical regimens must contain antibiotics broadly active against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria ([[quinolones]]: i.e. [[ciprofloxacin]], [[levofloxacin]], a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin with pseudomonal coverage: e.g. [[cefepime]], [[ceftazidime]], or an aminoglycoside: i.e. [[gentamicin]], [[amikacin]]).<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B97F0spKl2OwZTkzYTAyZjgtODRhYy00NzAwLWEzNjgtNTkyOTNmMjNlOGU4&hl=en |author=Brook I, Elliot TB, Ledney GD, Shomaker MO, Knudson GB |title=Management of postirradiation infection: lessons learned from animal models |journal=[[Military Medicine]] |issn=0026-4075 |year=2004 |volume=169 |pages=194–7 }}</ref>

==History==
Acute effects of ionizing radiation were first observed when [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] intentionally subjected his fingers to X-rays in 1895. He published his observations concerning the burns that developed, though he misattributed them to ozone, a [[free radical]] produced in air by X-rays. Other free radicals produced within the body are now understood to be more important. His injuries healed later.

Ingestion of radioactive materials caused many [[radiation-induced cancer]]s in the 1930s, but no one was exposed to high enough doses at high enough rates to bring on acute radiation syndrome. [[Marie Curie]] died of [[aplastic anemia]] caused by radiation, a possible early incident of acute radiation syndrome.

The [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] resulted in high acute doses of radiation to a large number of Japanese, allowing for greater insight into its symptoms and dangers. Red Cross Hospital Surgeon, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki led intensive research into the syndrome in the weeks and months following the Hiroshima bombings. Dr Sasaki and his team were able to monitor the effects of radiation in patients of varying proximities to the blast itself, leading to the establishment of three recorded stages of the syndrome. Within 25–30 days of the explosion, the Red Cross surgeon noticed a sharp drop in white blood cell count and established this drop, along with symptoms of fever, as prognostic standards for Acute Radiation Syndrome.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carmichael|first=Ann G.|title=Medicine: A Treasury of Art and Literature|year=1991|publisher=Harkavy Publishing Service|location=New York|isbn=0-88363-991-2|pages=376}}</ref>  Actress [[Midori Naka]], who was present during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, was the first incident of radiation poisoning to be extensively studied. Her death on August 24, 1945 was the first death ever to be officially certified as a result of acute radiation syndrome (or "Atomic bomb disease").

===Incidents===
{{Main|Nuclear and radiation accidents|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}
There are two major databases that track radiation accidents: The American [[ORISE]] REAC/TS and the European [[IRSN]] ACCIRAD. REAC/TS shows 417 accidents occurring between 1944 and 2000, causing about 3000 cases of acute radiation syndrome, of which 127 were fatal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turai|first=István|coauthors=Veress, Katalin|title=Radiation Accidents: Occurrence, Types, Consequences, Medical Management, and the Lessons to be Learned|journal=Central European Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|year=2001|volume=7|issue=1|pages=3–14|url=http://www.omfi.hu/cejoem/Volume7/Vol7No1/CE01_1-01.html|accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref> ACCIRAD lists 580 accidents with 180 ARS fatalities for an almost identical period.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chambrette|first=V.|coauthors=Hardy, S., et Nenot, J.-C.|title=Les accidents d’irradiation: Mise en place d’une base de données "ACCIRAD" à I’IPSN|journal=Radioprotection|year=2001|volume=36|issue=4|pages=477–510|doi=10.1051/radiopro:2001105|url=http://www.radioprotection.org/articles/radiopro/pdf/2001/04/Chambrette.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref> The two deliberate bombings are not included in either database, nor are any possible [[radiation-induced cancer]]s from low doses. The detailed accounting is difficult because of confounding factors. ARS may be accompanied by conventional injuries such as steam burns, or may occur in someone with a pre-existing condition undergoing radiotherapy. There may be multiple causes for death, and the contribution from radiation may be unclear. Some documents may incorrectly refer to radiation-induced cancers as radiation poisoning, or may count all overexposed individuals as survivors without mentioning if they had any symptoms of ARS. The table below attempts to catalog only cases of ARS. Many of these incidents involved additional fatalities from other causes, such as cancer, which are excluded from this table.

==In other animals==
Thousands of scientific experiments have been performed to study acute radiation syndrome in animals.

There is a simple guide for predicting survival/death in mammals, including humans, following the acute effects of inhaling radioactive particles.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wells J |title=A guide to the prognosis for survival in mammals following the acute effects of inhaled radioactive particles |journal=Journal of the Institution of Nuclear Engineers |issn=0368-2595 |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=126–131 |year=1976}}</ref>
