{{about|the Medical School in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|the Medical School in Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle Medical School}}

The '''University of Newcastle upon Tyne [[Medical School]]''' was established in 1834 in the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and served as the College of Medicine in connection with [[Durham University]] from 1851 to 1937 when it joined Armstrong College, to form King's College, Durham. In 1963 King's College became the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]]. The university now uses the name "Newcastle University".

== Curriculum ==
The medical school follows a modern, integrated, systems based curriculum, and was the first medical school in the country to operate an integrated medical curriculum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/alumni/arches/page.htm?years-of-medicine-at-newcastle |title=175 years of medicine at Newcastle |publisher=Newcastle University Alumni Association |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2011-04-24}}</ref> It operates in partnership with [[Durham University School of Medicine and Health|Durham University's medical school]], which is based at the university's [[Durham University#Queen's Campus, Stockton|Queen's Campus]]. Students at both Newcastle and Durham study independently for the first two years, before all being assigned to one of four separate clinical base units for the third year. These base units are [[Tyneside]], [[Northumbria]], [[Wearside]] and [[Teesside]]. It is at these base units that the bulk of clinical teaching takes place. All students, including those from Durham, then go to Newcastle Medical School for their fourth year before returning to a base unit different from the one they attended in third year for their fifth and final year of university teaching. Again, this is an almost entirely clinical year.

The medical school also offers an accelerated medical programme, intended for students who have a previous degree in a different (often unrelated) discipline.   This lasts four years, the first year covering the same material as the first two years of the five-year course.  Second year "accelerated" students are then taught alongside the third year students from the five-year programme.

== Ranking ==
Newcastle Medical consistently ranks as one of the top medical schools in the UK due to high levels of teaching and research. It is the first institution in the UK to be given permission to pursue stem-cell research. The BMC Medicine journal reported medical graduates from Oxford, Cambridge and Newcastle performed better in postgraduate tests than any other medical school in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7242897.stm |title=Call for medical training reform |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2008-02-18 |accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref>

As of 2008 the medical school admits some 327 British students per year with an additional 26 from overseas making it one of the largest medical schools in the UK.<ref name="statistics">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukmedicalschools.com/index.php?pageid=stats |title=UK Medical School Statistics |publisher=ukmedicalschools.com |accessdate=2008-09-08}} {{Dead link |date=October 2010 |bot=H3llBot}}</ref> According to [[UCAS]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and Newcastle are the most academically selective universities for entry to study medicine in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/|title=UCAS |publisher=[[UCAS]] |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2008-03-29}}</ref> Prospective students applying to the medical school for both the standard (five year) and accelerated (four year) programmes are required to sit the [[UK Clinical Aptitude Test|UKCAT]] admission test.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcat.ac.uk/ |title=UK Clinical Aptitude Test |publisher=UKCAT Consortium |accessdate=2009-09-15}}</ref>

== Malaysian campus branch ==
On 20 November 2008 the University announced that they were entering into an agreement to establish an international branch campus in [[Malaysia]] for the teaching of medical subjects. The development of the {{convert|13|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in [[Johor]], marks Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia (NUMed) as the 'anchor tenant' within the EduCity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/press.release/content.phtml?ref=1227175604 |title=University signs agreement for branch campus in Malaysia |publisher=Newcastle University |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref>

Staff moved into the NUMed Malaysia buildings on 3 May 2011, in preparation for students arriving in August.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/numed/about/news/item/malaysian-campus-ready-to-open-its-doors-copy |title=Malaysian campus ready to open its doors |publisher=NUMed Malaysia |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2011-05-24}}</ref> The Malaysian Bell's Court building features a section which is designed to look like the Arches in Newcastle upon Tyne.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/numed/about/campus/gallery/ |title=Gallery |publisher=NUMed |accessdate=2011-05-24}}</ref>

==The Medical Society (MedSoc)==
Established in 1879, The Medical Society is the student society for all medical students at Newcastle. The main social event is a free bar in the Students' Union every Friday during term. They also organise events such as the Christmas Ball, MedSoc Olympics and Metroline, a pub crawl which takes place on a Wednesday afternoon during the Easter term and involves taking the [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Metro train service]] and travelling to the coast and back dressed as doctors and nurses. MedSoc is run by a committee of third year medical students, and tradition dictates you must be in this year to be elected. Campaigns for election to the committee last the whole of February and have various evenings such as "Take Over". They culminate in a hustings event where each campaign team shows a 20 minute video they have produced. Medsoc also helps provide a platform for fundraising by the various charities in the Medical School as well as running its own fundraising events. Members are heavily involved in the Medics Revue, a comedy sketch show produced by third years in the summer term, portraying the events of the Medical School during the last academic year.
