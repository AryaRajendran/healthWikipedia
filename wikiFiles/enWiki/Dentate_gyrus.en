The molecular layer of dentate gyrus granual neurons receive the hippocampal formation's major excitatory input from the cortex. This input is primarily derived from layer II of the [[entorhinal cortex]] and enables the dentate gyrus to gate information flow into the hippocampus [[trisynaptic loop]].

==Structure==
{{Main|Hippocampal subfields}}

The dentate gyrus is composed of undirectional projections dispersed towards CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus.<ref>{{Cite book|authors=A. Treves; A. Tashiro; M.P. Witter; E.I. Moser |title=What is the mammalian dentate gyrus good for? |edition=154|issue=4|year=2008 |pages=1155-1172}}</ref> It consists of [[archicortex|three layers of neurons]]: molecular, granular, and polymorphic. The middle layer is most prominent and contains [[granule cell]]s that project to the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus, as previously mentioned.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Nolte, John |title=The Human Brain: An Introduction to Its Functional Neuroanatomy |edition=fifth|year=2002 |pages=570–573}}</ref> These [[granule cell]]s project mostly to [[interneuron]]s, but also to pyramidal cells and are the principal excitatory neurons of the dentate gyrus. The major input to the dentate gyrus (the so-called perforant pathway) is from layer 2 of the entorhinal cortex, and the dentate gyrus receives no direct inputs from other cortical structures. The perforant pathway is divided into the [[medial perforant path]] and the [[lateral perforant path]], generated, respectively, at the medial and lateral portions of the entorhinal cortex. The medial perforant path synapses onto the proximal dendritic area of the granule cells, whereas the lateral perforant path does so onto the distal dendrites of these same cells. 
Most lateral views of the dentate gyrus may appear to suggest a structure consisting of just one entity, but medial movement may provide evidence of the ventral and dorsal parts of the dentate gyrus.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rachel A. Dalley, Lydia L. Ng, Angela L. Guillozet-Bongaarts|journal=Nature Preceedings|title=Dentate Gyrus|doi=10.1038/npre.2008.2095.1}}</ref>

==Development==
The granule cells in the dentate gyrus are distinguished by their late time of formation during brain development.  In rats, approximately 85% of the granule cells are generated after birth.<ref>{{cite pmid|4430737}}</ref>  In humans, it is estimated that granule cells begin to be generated during gestation weeks 10.5 to 11, and continue being generated during the second and third trimesters, after birth and all the way into adulthood.<ref>{{Cite book| author = Bayer SA Altman J | title = The Human Brain During The Early First Trimester | volume = 5 Atlas of Human Central Nervous System Development | year = 2008| unused_data = Appendix page = 497}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Eriksson PS, Perfilieva E, Björk-Eriksson T, ''et al.'' |title=Neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus |journal=Nat Med. |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=1313–7 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9809557 |doi=10.1038/3305 |url=}}</ref>  The germinal sources of granule cells and their migration pathways <ref>{{cite pmid|2262596}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|2262594}}</ref> have been studied during rat brain development.  The oldest granule cells are generated in a specific region of the hippocampal neuroepithelium and migrate into the primordial dentate gyrus around embryonic days (E) 17/18, and then settle as the outermost cells in the forming granular layer.  Next, dentate precursor cells move out of this same area of the hippocampal neuroepithelium and, retaining their mitotic capacity, invade the hilus (core) of the forming dentate gyrus.  This dispersed germinal matrix is the source of granule cells from that point on.  The newly generated granule cells accumulate under the older cells that began to settle in the granular layer.  As more granule cells are produced, the layer thickens and the cells are stacked up according to age - the oldest being the most superficial and the youngest being deeper.<ref>{{cite pmid|5838955}}</ref>  The granule cell precursors remain in a subgranular zone that becomes progressively thinner as the dentate gyrus grows, but these precursor cells are retained in adult rats.  These sparsely scattered cells constantly generate granule cell neurons,<ref>{{cite pmid|7079742}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|7095040}}</ref> which add to the total population. There are a variety of other differences in the rat, monkey and human dentate gyrus. The granule cells only have apical dendrites in the rat.But in the monkey and human, many granule cells also have basal dendrites. <ref>{Amaral DG.,Scharfman HE., Lavenex P.

The dentate gyrus is thought to contribute to the formation of memories, and to play a role in [[depression (mood)|depression]].

===Memory===
The dentate gyrus is one of the few regions of the adult brain where [[neurogenesis]] (i.e., the birth of new neurons) takes place. Neurogenesis is thought to play a role in the formation of new memories. New memories could preferentially use newly formed dentate gyrus cells, providing a potential mechanism for distinguishing multiple instances of similar events or multiple visits to the same location.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} A Study at the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging showed that feeding blueberry extract to older rats for a short time frame increases neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. This increased neurogenesis is associated with improved spatial memory, as seen through performance in a maze.<ref>Bliss, Rosalie Marion. "Food and the Aging Mind". First in a Series: Nutrition and Brain Function. http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/ar/archive/aug07/aging0807.htm. (27 February 2010)</ref>

===Stress and depression===
The dentate gyrus may also have a functional role in stress and depression. For instance, neurogenesis has been found to increase in response to chronic treatment with [[antidepressant]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Malberg JE, Eisch AJ, Nestler EJ, Duman RS |title=Chronic antidepressant treatment increases neurogenesis in adult rat hippocampus |journal=J. Neurosci |volume=20 |issue=24 |pages=9104–9110 |year=2000 |pmid=11124987}}</ref> On the contrary, however, the physiological effects of stress, often characterized by release of [[glucocorticoid]]s such as [[cortisol]], as well as activation of the sympathetic division of the [[autonomic nervous system]],  have been shown to inhibit the process of neurogenesis in primates.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gould E, Tanapat P, McEwen BS, Flugge G, Fuchs E |title=Proliferation of granule cell precursors in the dentate gyrus of adult monkeys is diminished by stress |journal=PNAS |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=3168–3171 |year=1998 |pmid=9501234 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.6.3168 |pmc=19713|bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.3168G }}</ref> Both endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids are known to cause psychosis and [[Clinical depression|depression]],<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jacobs B, Praag H, Gage F |title=Adult brain neurogenesis and psychiatry: a novel theory of depression |journal=Mol. Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=262–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10889528 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4000712}}</ref> implying that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus may play an important role in modulating symptoms of stress and depression.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Surget A, Tanti A, Leonardo ED ''et al.'' |title=Antidepressants recruit new neurons to improve stress response regulation. |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |issue=12 |year=2011 |month=December |pmid=21537331 |doi=10.1038/mp.2011.48 |url=http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp201148a.html |volume=16 |pmc=3223314 |pages=1177–88}}</ref>

===Other===
Some evidence suggests neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus increases in response to [[exercise|aerobic exercise]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Praag|first=H|year=1999|title=Running increases cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=2|pages=266–270|doi=10.1038/6368|pmid=10195220|issue=3}}</ref> Several experiments have shown neurogenesis (the development of nerve tissues) often increases in the dentate gyrus of adult rodents when they are exposed to an enriched environment.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kempermann G, Kuhn HG, Gage FH, |title=More hippocampal neurons in adult mice living in an enriched environment |journal=Nature |volume=386 |issue=6624 |pages=493–495 |year=1997 |pmid=9087407 |doi=10.1038/386493a0|bibcode = 1997Natur.386..493K }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Eadie|first=B.D.|coauthors=Redilla, VA. & Christie, B.R.|title=Voluntary excercise alters the cytoarchitecture of the adult dentate gyrus by increasing cellular proliferation, dendritic complexity, and spine density.|journal=The Journal of Comparable Neurology|year=2005|volume=486|pages=39–47}}</ref>
The dentate gyrus is also known to serve as a pre-processing unit. When information enters, it is known to separate very similar information into distinct and unique details. This prepares the relevant data for storage in the hippocampal CA3 section.<ref>http://www.frontiersin.org/Neural_Circuits/researchtopics/Structure_function_and_plastic/737</ref>

===Spatial behavior===
Studies have shown destroying about 90% of their dentate gyrus (dg) cells, rats had extreme difficulty in maneuvering through a maze they had been through prior to the lesion. When being put through the test, a number of times were given to the rats to see whether they could relearn the maze, and the results showed the rats showed no improvement at all, which indicated their working memory is severely impaired. Rats have trouble with place strategies because they cannot consolidate what they have learned about the maze in the current run into the their working memory so they can remember it later when maneuvering through the same maze a repeated number of times. Every time the rat enters the maze, the rat behaves as if it has seen the maze for the first time.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Xavier, GF|title=Dentate gyrus and spatial behaviour|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry|year=2009|volume=33|issue=5|pages=762–773|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.03.036}}</ref>

===Blood sugar===
Studies by researchers at [[Columbia University Medical Center]] indicate poor glucose control can lead to deleterious effects on the dentate gyrus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/health/31memory.html?_r=1&em=&pagewanted=print|title=Blood Sugar Control Linked to Memory Decline, Study Says |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= 1 January 2009|accessdate=2011-03-13}}</ref>
