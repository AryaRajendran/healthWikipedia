==Signs and symptoms==
Women with this condition experience a constant pain that may be dull and aching, but is occasionally more acute. The pain is worse at the end of the day and after long periods of standing, and sufferers get relief when they lie down. The pain is worse during or after [[sexual intercourse]], and can be worse just before the onset of the [[menstrual period]].<ref name=veindirectory/><ref name=Merck/>

Women with pelvic congestion syndrome have a larger [[uterus]] and a thicker [[endometrium]]. 56% of women manifest [[cyst]]ic changes to the ovaries,<ref name=Reginald>{{cite web|url=http://www.pelvicpain.org/news/pdfs/vol4_no2.pdf|author= Phillip Reginald, MD|publisher=The International Pelvic Pain Society|format=PDF||title=Pelvic Congestion|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> and many report other symptoms, such as [[dysmenorrhea]], back pain, [[vaginal discharge]], abdominal bloating, mood swings or depression, and fatigue.<ref name=veindirectory/><ref name=Merck/>

Diagnosis can be made using [[ultrasound]] or [[laparoscopy]] testing. The condition can also be diagnosed with a [[venogram]], [[CT scan]], or an [[MRI]]. Ultrasound is the diagnostic tool most commonly used.<ref name=veindirectory/><ref name=Merck/>

==Treatment==
Early treatment options include pain medication using [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s,<ref name=Merck/> suppression of [[ovary|ovarian function]],<ref name=Reginald/> and alternative therapies such as [[acupuncture]] and [[physical therapy]].<ref name=veindirectory/>

The surgical option involves stopping blood flow to the varicose veins using [[noninvasive]] surgical techniques such as a procedure called embolization. The procedure requires an overnight stay in hospital, and is done using [[local anesthetic]].<ref name=veindirectory/><ref name=Hopkins/> Patients report an 80% success rate, as measured by the amount of pain reduction experienced.<ref name=Hopkins>{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/vascular/conditions/pelvic/|title=Pelvic Pain (Pelvic Congestion Syndrome)|publisher=Johns Hopkins|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref>
