A '''thyroid disease''' is a medical condition impairing the function of the [[thyroid]].

==Diseases==

===Functional disorders===
Imbalance in production of [[thyroid hormone]]s arises from dysfunction of the [[thyroid gland]] itself, the [[pituitary gland]], which produces [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), or the [[hypothalamus]], which regulates the pituitary gland via [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] (TRH). Concentrations of TSH increase with age, requiring age-corrected tests.<ref name="pmid17911171">{{cite journal |author=Surks MI, Hollowell JG |title=Age-specific distribution of serum thyrotropin and antithyroid antibodies in the US population: implications for the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism |journal=J.

===Tumors===
* [[Thyroid adenoma]]

** Anaplastic
* [[Lymphoma]]s and [[metastasis]] from elsewhere (rare)

==Diagnosis==

===Blood tests===
* The measurement of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH) levels is often used by doctors as a screening test. Elevated TSH levels can signify an inadequate [[thyroid hormone]] production, while suppressed levels can point at excessive unregulated production of hormone.

===Ultrasound===
Nodules of the thyroid may or may not be [[cancer]]. [[Medical ultrasonography]] can help determine their nature because some of the characteristics of benign and malignant nodules differ. The main characteristics of a thyroid nodule on high frequency thyroid ultrasound are as follows:{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Radioiodine scanning and uptake===
Thyroid [[scintigraphy]], imaging of the thyroid with the aid of radioactive iodine, usually [[iodine-123]] (<sup>123</sup>I), is performed in the [[nuclear medicine]] department of a hospital or clinic. Radioiodine collects in the thyroid gland before being excreted in the urine.

===Biopsy===
A medical [[biopsy]] refers to the obtaining of a tissue sample for examination under the microscope or other testing, usually to distinguish cancer from noncancerous conditions. Thyroid tissue may be obtained for biopsy by [[fine needle aspiration]] or by [[surgery]].

==Treatment==

===Medical treatment===
[[Levothyroxine]] is a [[stereoisomer]] of thyroxine which is degraded much slower and can be administered once daily in patients with hypothyroidism. A more natural remedy is T4 Armour.  It is available in doses similar to Levothyroxine. It is chemically identical to natural T4 as opposed to the stereoisomer Levothyroxine.  Armour is derived from porcine thyroid tissue.

===Surgery===
Thyroid surgery is performed for a variety of reasons. A [[thyroid nodule|nodule]] or lobe of the thyroid is sometimes removed for [[biopsy]] or for the presence of an autonomously functioning [[thyroid adenoma|adenoma]] causing [[hyperthyroidism]].

===Radioiodine therapy===
Large goiters that cause symptoms but do not harbor cancer, after evaluation and biopsy of suspicious nodules, can be treated by an alternative therapy with radioiodine.
