In the United Kingdom a [[Strategic Health Authority]] can direct a water company to fluoridate the water supply in an area if it is technically possible. The strategic health authority must consult with the local community and businesses in the affected area.

In areas with complex water sources, water fluoridation is more difficult and more costly. Alternative fluoridation methods have been proposed, and implemented in some parts of the world. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is currently assessing the effects of fluoridated toothpaste, milk fluoridation and salt fluoridation in Africa, Asia, and Europe.  The WHO supports fluoridation of water in some areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/entity/oral_health/media/en/orh_report03_en.pdf |title=World Oral Health Report |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=4 March 2006}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of water fluoridation}}

The first large fluoridation controversy occurred in Wisconsin in 1950. Fluoridation opponents questioned the ethics, safety, and efficacy of fluoridation.<ref name=Musto>{{cite journal |author=Musto RJ |title=Fluoridation: why is it not more widely adopted? |journal=CMAJ |volume=137 |issue=8 |pages=705–8 |year=1987 |month=October |pmid=3651941 |pmc=1267306 |url=}}</ref> New Zealand was the second country to fluoridate, and similar controversies arose there.<ref name=Wrapson>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/40111610 | year = 2005 | title = Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies in New Zealand:‘Magic Bullet,’Rat Poison, or Communist Plot? | journal = Health and History | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 17–29 | url = http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/hah/7.2/wrapson.html | author = Wrapson J | jstor = 40111610}}</ref> Fears about fluoride were likely exacerbated by the reputation of fluoride compounds as insect poisons and by early literature which tended to use terms such as "toxic" and "low grade chronic [[fluoride poisoning]]" to describe mottling from consumption of 6&nbsp;mg/L of fluoride prior to tooth eruption, a level of consumption not expected to occur under controlled fluoridation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richmond VL |title=Thirty years of fluoridation: a review |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=129–38 |year=1985 |month=January |pmid=3917599 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3917599}}</ref> When voted upon, the outcomes tend to be negative, and thus fluoridation has had a history of gaining through administrative orders in North America.<ref name=Musto/> Theories for why the public tends to reject fluoridation include "alienation from mainstream" society, but evidence for that is weak. Another interpretation is confusion introduced during the referendum.<ref name=Musto/> Some studies of the sociology of opposition to water fluoridation have been criticized for having an uncritical attitude toward scientific knowledge.<ref name=Martin1989/>

Outside of North America, water fluoridation was adopted in European countries, but in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Denmark and Sweden banned fluoridation when government panels found insufficient evidence of safety, and the Netherlands banned water fluoridation when "a group of medical practitioners presented evidence" that it caused negative effects in a percentage of the population.

=== Conspiracy theories ===
[[File:Unholy three.png|right|thumb|200px|Flier issued in May 1955 by the Keep America Committee, alleging a [[conspiracy theory]] that water fluoridation is a communist plot.]]
Water fluoridation has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories. During the "[[Red Scare]]" in the United States during the late 1940s and 1950s, and to a lesser extent in the 1960s, activists on the far right of American politics routinely asserted that fluoridation was part of a far-reaching plot to impose a socialist or communist regime. They also opposed other public health programs, notably mass [[vaccination]] and [[mental health]] services.<ref name="Henig">{{cite book | last = Henig | first = Robin Marantz | title = The People's Health | publisher = Joseph Henry Press| year = 1997 | isbn = 0-309-05492-3 | page = 85 }}</ref> Their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years: the growth of internationalism, particularly the UN and its programs; the introduction of [[social welfare provision]]s, particularly the various programs established by the [[New Deal]]; and government efforts to reduce perceived inequalities in the [[social structure of the United States]].<ref name="Rovere">{{cite book | last = Rovere | first = Richard H. | title = Senator Joe McCarthy | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1959 | pages = 21–22| isbn = 0-520-20472-7 }}</ref>

Some took the view that fluoridation was only the first stage of a plan to control the American people.  Fluoridation, it was claimed, was merely a stepping-stone on the way to implementing more ambitious programs. Others asserted the existence of a plot by communists and the United Nations to "deplete the brainpower and sap the strength of a generation of American children". Dr. Charles Bett, a prominent anti-fluoridationist, charged that fluoridation was "better THAN USING THE ATOM BOMB because the atom bomb has to be made, has to be transported to the place it is to be set off while POISONOUS FLUORINE has been placed right beside the water supplies by the Americans themselves ready to be dumped into the water mains whenever a Communist desires!" Similarly, a right-wing newsletter, the ''American Capsule News'', claimed that "the Soviet General Staff is very happy about it. Anytime they get ready to strike, and their [[fifth column|5th column]] takes over, there are tons and tons of this poison "standing by" municipal and military water systems ready to be poured in within 15 minutes."<ref name="Johnston" />

This viewpoint led to major controversies over public health programs in the US, most notably in the case of the [[Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act]] controversy of 1956.<ref>{{Cite book | last= Marmor | given= Judd | chapter=Psychodynamics of Group Opposition to Mental Health Programs | title=Psychiatry in Transition | publisher=Brunner/Mazel | year=1974 | isbn = 0-87630-070-0}}</ref> In the case of fluoridation, the controversy had a direct impact on local programs. During the 1950s and 1960s, referendums on introducing fluoridation were defeated in over a thousand Florida communities. Although the opposition was overcome in time, it was not until as late as the 1990s that fluoridated water was drunk by the majority of the population of the United States.<ref name="Henig" />

The communist conspiracy argument declined in influence by the mid-1960s, becoming associated in the public mind with irrational fear and paranoia. It was portrayed in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1964 film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', in which the character General Jack D. Ripper initiates a nuclear war in the hope of thwarting a communist plot to "sap and impurify" the "precious bodily fluids" of the American people with fluoridated water. Another satire appeared in the 1967 movie ''[[In Like Flint]]'', in which a character's fear of fluoridation is used to indicate that he is insane. Some anti-fluoridationists claimed that the conspiracy theories were damaging their goals; Dr. Frederick Exner, an anti-fluoridation campaigner in the early 1960s, told a conference: "most people are not prepared to believe that fluoridation is a communist plot, and if you say it is, you are successfully ridiculed by the promoters. It is being done, effectively, every day ... some of the people on our side are the fluoridators' 'fifth column'."<ref name="Johnston" />

In 2004 on the U.S. television program ''Democracy Now'', investigative journalist and author of the book ''The Fluoride Deception'', Christopher Bryson claimed that, “the post-war campaign to fluoridate drinking water was less a public health innovation than a public relations ploy sponsored by industrial users of fluoride–including the government’s nuclear weapons program.”<ref>Bryson, Christopher.

==Court cases==

===Europe===
Water was fluoridated in large parts of the Netherlands from 1960 to 1973, when the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]] declared fluoridation of drinking water unauthorized.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3UoZAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA487&lpg=PA487&dq=fluoridering+nederland&source=web&ots=gBeB1umWcI&sig=w-iamuX7EZ4PBcwWbRPObOnTQHM&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result#PPA488,M1 |author=Bram van der Lek |title=De strijd tegen fluoridering |journal=De Gids |volume=139 |issue=2 |year=1976 }}</ref> Dutch authorities had no legal basis for adding chemicals to drinking water if they did not improve the safety as such. The simple reason is that consumers cannot choose a different tap water provider.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leonardus Johannes Antonius Damen, Peter Nicolaï, J.L. Boxum, K.J. de Graaf, J.H. Jans, A.P.

In ''Ryan v. Attorney General'' (1965), the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] held that water fluoridation did not infringe the plaintiff's right to bodily integrity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IESC/1965/1.html |title=Ryan v. A.G. IESC 1; IR 294 (3 July, 1965) |publisher=Irish Supreme Court }}</ref> However, the court found that such a right to bodily integrity did exist, despite the fact that it was not explicitly mentioned in the [[Constitution of Ireland]], thus establishing the doctrine of [[unenumerated rights]] in Irish constitutional law.

===United States===
{{See also|Water fluoridation in the United States}}
Fluoridation has been the subject of many [[Legal case|court cases]] wherein activists have sued municipalities, asserting that their rights to consent to medical treatment and [[due process]] are infringed by mandatory water fluoridation.<ref name=Cross2003/> Individuals have sued municipalities for a number of illnesses that they believe were caused by fluoridation of the city's water supply. In most of these cases, the courts have held in favor of cities, finding no or only a tenuous connection between health problems and widespread water fluoridation.<ref name="beck">Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills, 30 Cal. App. 3d 112, 115 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1973) ("Courts through the United States have uniformly held that fluoridation of water is a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power in the interest of public health. The matter is no longer an open question." (citations omitted)).</ref>  To date, no federal appellate court or state court of last resort (i.e., state supreme court) has found water fluoridation to be unlawful.<ref>Pratt, Edwin, Raymond D. Rawson & Mark Rubin, ''Fluoridation at Fifty: What Have We Learned'', 30 J.L. Med. & Ethics 117, 119 (Fall 2002)</ref>
