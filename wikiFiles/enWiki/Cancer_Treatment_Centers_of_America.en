== History ==
CTCA was founded in 1988 by [[Richard J. Stephenson]] after his mother lost her battle with [[cancer]].  Stephenson was unsatisfied with the treatment options available to his mother and opened the first CTCA hospital.<ref name="cancercenter.com">[http://www.cancercenter.com/about-us/history.cfm "Cancer Treatment Centers of America: History".] Retrieved on 2008-04-07.</ref>  The first hospital to open was Midwestern Regional Medical Center in northern [[Illinois]].

== Controversy ==
Cancer Treatment Centers of America was the subject of a [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) complaint in 1993. The FTC alleged that CTCA made false claims regarding the success rates of certain cancer treatments in their promotional materials. This claim was settled in March 1996, requiring CTCA to discontinue use of any unsubstantiated claims in their advertising.<ref>[http://www.quackwatch.com/02ConsumerProtection/FTCActions/ctca.html "Companies That Purport to Successfully Treat Cancer Agree to Settle FTC Charges over Their Claims".] Retrieved on 2008-04-07.</ref> CTCA is also required to have proven, scientific evidence for all statements regarding the safety, success rates, endorsements, and benefits of their cancer treatments. CTCA was also required to follow various steps in order to report compliance to the FTC per the settlement.

Cancer centers and hospitals in general (including Cancer Treatment Centers of America) have been the subjects of some controversy over their advertising.<ref name="nytimes.com">Natasha Singer, [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/19/health/19cancerads.html "Cancer Center Ads Use Emotion More Than Fact"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 19, 2009.</ref><ref name="annarbor.com">[http://www.annarbor.com/news/disconnect-between-hospital-marketing-and-actual-hospital-care-u-m-professor-says/ "The New York Times - 'Disconnect' between hospital marketing and actual outcomes, U-M professor says"], ''[[AnnArbor.com]]'', December 21, 2009.</ref> Many doctors and other observers<ref name="query.nytimes.com">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7DE1F3FF93BA15751C1A96F9C8B63 "LETTERS; Cancer Care: Deciding Where to Go"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 28, 2009.</ref> have noted that many cancer organizations' advertising are sparsely regulated and, therefore, often contain unsupported and misleading claims as to the efficacy of their cancer treatments.<ref name="nytimes.com"/><ref name="annarbor.com"/><ref name="query.nytimes.com"/>

In 2001, the FDA issued CTCA a [[FDA Warning Letter|Warning Letter]] concerning three clinical trials that were conducted in violation of FDA requirements.<ref>[http://www.casewatch.org/fdawarning/prod/2001/cancercenters.shtml "Warning Letter to Cancer Treatment Centers of America"]</ref>

CTCA continues to find itself under fire for cherry picking its patients and denying by using demographics treatment to those whose prognosis would hurt their performance statistics. In at least one case, CTCA appears to have stopped treating a patient so her data would be excluded from its results because it only reports results for patients who remain in treatment.<ref>"Special [http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/06/us-usa-cancer-ctca-idUSBRE9250L820130306 Report: Behind a cancer-treatment firm's rosy survival claims," Reuters] Accessed 2013-03-20</ref>
