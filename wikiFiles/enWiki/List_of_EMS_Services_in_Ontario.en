This is a list of [[emergency medical services]] providers in the [[Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]]. In 1999 emergency medical services were downloaded from the province to the upper tier municipalities (counties). The municipality had the choice of either providing service themselves or to contract it out to a private provider. While most decided to operate ambulance services in house some chose to contract it out.
