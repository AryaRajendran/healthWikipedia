In [[cell (biology)|cellular]] [[pathology]], '''steatosis''' (also called ''fatty change'', ''fatty degeneration'' or ''adipose degeneration'') is the process describing the abnormal retention of [[lipid]]s within a cell. It reflects an impairment of the normal processes of [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] and elimination of [[triglyceride]] fat. Excess lipid accumulates in [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s that displace the [[cytoplasm]]. When the vesicles are large enough to distort the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], the condition is known as '''macrovesicular steatosis'''; otherwise, the condition is known as '''microvesicular steatosis'''. While not particularly detrimental to the cell in mild cases, large accumulations can disrupt cell constituents, and in severe cases the cell may even burst. 

The risk factors associated with steatosis are varied, and include [[diabetes mellitus]],<ref name="araya">{{cite journal | author=Araya Q AV ''et al.''| title=Glucose tolerance alterations and frequency of metabolic syndrome among patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease| journal=Rev Med Chil.| year=2006| volume=134| issue=9| pages=1092–1098 | pmid=17167710}}</ref> protein malnutrition,<ref name="conde">{{cite journal | author=Conde Martel A ''et al.''| title=Liver changes in protein malnutrition.

== Pathogenesis ==
No single mechanism leading to steatosis exists, rather a varied multitude of pathologies disrupt normal lipid movement through the cell and cause accumulation. These mechanisms can be separated on whether they ultimately cause an oversupply of lipid which can not be removed quickly enough (too much in), or whether they cause a failure in lipid breakdown (not enough used). 

'''Macrovesicular''' is the more common form of fatty degeneration, and may be caused by oversupply of lipids due to obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),<ref>Bhattacharjee et al, 2010. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2938852/pdf/aasm.33.9.1133.pdf</ref> insulin resistance, or [[alcoholism]]. Nutrient malnutrition may also cause the mobilisation of fat from [[adipocyte]]s and create a local oversupply in the liver where lipid metabolism occurs. Excess alcohol over a long period of time can induce steatosis. The breakdown of large amounts of [[ethanol]] in alcoholic drinks produces large amounts of chemical energy, in the form of [[NADH]], signalling to the cell to inhibit the breakdown of [[fatty acid]]s (which also produces energy) and simultaneously increase the synthesis of [[fatty acid]]s. This "false sense of energy" results in more lipid being created than is needed.

'''Microvesicular''' fatty degeneration is characterized by small intracytoplasmic fat vacuoles (Liposomes) which accumulate in the cell. Common causes are [[Tetracyclines]], Acute fatty liver of Pregnancy, [[Reye’s Syndrome]], and [[Hepatitis D]].

Failure of lipid metabolism can also lead to the mechanisms which would normally utilise or remove lipids becoming impaired, resulting in the accumulation of unused lipids in the cell. Certain toxins, such as alcohols, [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[aspirin]], and [[diphtheria toxin]], interfere with cellular machinery involved in lipid metabolism. In those with [[Gaucher's disease]], the [[lysosome]]s fail to degrade lipids and steatosis arises from the accumulation of [[glycolipid]]s. Protein malnutrition, such as that seen in [[kwashiorkor]], results in a lack of precursor [[Apolipoprotein|apoproteins]] within the cell, therefore unused lipids which would normally participate in [[lipoprotein]] synthesis begin to accumulate.

== Histology ==
<!-- [[Image:Livers.jpg|thumb|250px|The duck liver on the left has been fattened by force feeding to make [[foie gras]], compared to an ordinary duck liver on the right.]] -->[[histology|Histologically]], steatosis is physically apparent as lipid within membrane bound [[liposome]]s of [[parenchyma]]l cells.<ref name="robspath"/> When this tissue is [[Staining|fixed and stained]] to be better viewed under a microscope, the lipid is usually dissolved by the solvents used to prepare the sample. As such, samples prepared this way will appear to have empty holes within the cells where the lipid has been cleared. Special lipid stains, such as [[Sudan stain]]s and [[Staining#Osmium_tetroxide|osmium tetroxide]] are able to retain and show up lipid droplets, hence more conclusively indicating the presence of lipids. Other intracellular accumulations, such as water or [[glycogen]], can also appear as clear vacuoles, therefore it becomes necessary to use stains to better decide what is accumulating.

Grossly, steatosis causes organ enlargement and lightening in colour.<ref name="robspath"/> This is due to the high lipid content increasing the organ's volume and becoming visible to the unaided eye. In severe cases, the organ may become vastly enlarged, greasy, and yellow in appearance.

== Radiography ==
[[File:Liversteatosis.png|thumb|Liver steatosis (fatty liver disease) as seen on CT]]
On [[X-ray computed tomography]] (CT), the increased fat component will decrease the density of the liver tissue, making the image less bright. Typically the density of the spleen and liver are roughly equivalent. In steatosis, there is a difference between the density and brightness of the two organs, with the liver appearing darker.<ref name="Helms 2007">{{cite book |author=Helms, Clyde A.; Brant, William E. |title=Fundamentals of diagnostic radiology |publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins |location=Phila |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-6135-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
On ultrasound, fat is more [[echogenicity|echogenic]] (capable of reflecting sound waves). The combination of liver steatosis being dark on CT and bright on ultrasound is sometimes known as the flip flop sign.
