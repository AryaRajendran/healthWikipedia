[[Salt]] consumption has been intensely studied for its role in human physiology and impact on human health. In particular, excessive dietary salt consumption over an extended period of time has been associated with [[hypertension]] and [[cardiovascular disease]], in addition to other [[Salt#Health_effects|adverse health effects]].<ref>{{cite book |author= |title=Dietary reference intakes for water, potassium, sodium, chloride, and sulfate |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-309-53049-0 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10925}}{{page needed|date=December 2010}}</ref><ref name="Klaus D 2009">{{cite journal |month=May |last1=Klaus |year=2009 |first1=D |last2=Böhm |first2=M |last3=Halle |first3=M |last4=Kolloch |first4=R |last5=Middeke |first5=M |last6=Pavenstädt |first6=H |last7=Hoyer |first7=J |title=Die Beschränkung der Kochsalzaufnahme in der Gesamtbevölkerung verspricht langfristig großen Nutzen |trans_title=Restriction of salt intake in the whole population promises great long-term benefits |pages=S108–18 |language=German |journal=Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift |volume=3 |doi=10.1055/s-0029-1222573 |pmid=19418415}}</ref> 

Most forms of edible salt are composed primarily of sodium and chloride, as other minerals such as magnesium and calcium, make unrefined salts bitter and therefore rarely eaten.<ref>Ann Louise Gittleman, Sodium is essential to life. Total health magazine, vol 22, no 2.</ref> An excessive intake of the ionic compound [[sodium chloride]] has long been suspected to increase [[blood pressure]].<ref name="Klaus D 2009"/> [[Sodium]] and [[chloride]] serum levels are both carefully controlled by the kidneys, and acute and chronic excessive intake of both ions can cause adverse health effect.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |first1=Bengt |title=Regulation of body fluids |journal=Annual review of physiology |volume=39 |pages=185–200 |year=1977 |last1=Andersson |pmid=322597 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.39.030177.001153}}</ref> However, only [[serum sodium]] is thought to be strongly correlated to blood pressure levels and cardiovascular disease.

== Effect of Salt on Blood Pressure ==

[[File:Automatische bloeddrukmeter (0).jpg|thumb|Automated blood pressure device]]

The human body has evolved to balance salt intake with need through means such as the [[renin-angiotensin]] system. In humans, salt has important biological functions. Relevant to risk of cardiovascular disease, salt is highly involved with the maintenance of [[body fluid]] volume, including [[osmotic balance]] in the blood, [[extracellular]] and [[intracellular]] fluids.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The well known effect of sodium on blood pressure can be explained by comparing blood to a [[solution]] with its [[salinity]] changed by ingested salt. [[Artery walls]] are analogous to a [[selectively permeable membrane]] which allows sodium chloride to enter the blood stream.

Circulating water and [[solutes]] in the body maintain blood pressure in the blood, as well as other functions such as regulation of [[body temperature]]. When too much salt is ingested, it is dissolved in the blood as two separate ions - Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>. The [[water potential]] in blood will decrease due to the increase solutes, and blood [[osmotic pressure]] will increase. While the kidney reacts to excrete excess sodium and chloride in the body, [[water retention]] causes blood pressure to increase inside blood vessel walls.<ref name="Blaustein">{{cite journal |pmid=324293 |last1=Blaustein |first1=MP |year=1977 |pages=C165–73 |issue=5 |volume=232 |title=Sodium ions, calcium ions, blood pressure regulation, and hypertension: a reassessment and a hypothesis |journal=The American journal of physiology |url=http://ajpcell.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&pmid=324293}}</ref>

Blood pressure may continue to build as water is consumed hours after salt is ingested.<ref name="Anderson">{{cite web |first1=J. |last1=Anderson |first2=L. |last2=Young |first3=E. |last3=Long |title=Potassium and Health |year=2008 |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09355.html}}</ref> As excess sodium is excreted by the kidneys, blood pressure drops accordingly.<ref name="Anderson"/> Diets that consistently contain high salt content will increase blood pressure over time. Fortunately, as many studies have shown, limiting salt intake in the diet can reverse these effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=T|title=Renin, angiotensin, sodium and organ damage.|journal=Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension|date=2003 May|year=2003|month=May|volume=26|issue=5|pages=349-54|pmid=12887125}}</ref> 

Since most cases of hypertension are [[essential hypertension]], it is unlikely that a single factor can be attributed to the cause of hypertension in most hypertensive patients.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10645931 |last1=Carretero |year=2000 |first1=OA |pages=329–35 |issue=3 |volume=101 |last2=Oparil |journal=Circulation |first2=S |title=Essential hypertension.

=== DASH-Sodium Study ===
{{Main|DASH diet}}

The DASH-Sodium study was a sequel to the original [[DASH diet|DASH]] (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) study. Both studies were designed and conducted by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] in the United States, each involving a large, randomized sample.<ref name="Karanja N 2004">{{cite journal |last1=Karanja |first1=N. |last2=Erlinger |first2=T P |last3=Pao-Hwa |first3=L. |last4=Miller |first4=E. R |last5=Bray |first5=G. A |title=The DASH diet for high blood pressure: from clinical trial to dinner table |journal=Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine |volume=71 |issue=9 |pages=745–53 |year=2004 |pmid=15478706 |doi=10.3949/ccjm.71.9.745}}</ref> While the original study was designed to test the effects of several varying nutrients on blood pressure, DASH-Sodium varies only in salt content in the diet.<ref name="Sacks F 2001">{{cite journal |last1=Sacks |first1=Frank M. |last2=Svetkey |first2=Laura P. |last3=Vollmer |first3=William M. |last4=Appel |first4=Lawrence J. |last5=Bray |first5=George A. |last6=Harsha |first6=David |last7=Obarzanek |first7=Eva |last8=Conlin |first8=Paul R. |last9=Miller |first9=Edgar R. |title=Effects on Blood Pressure of Reduced Dietary Sodium and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=344 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |year=2001 |pmid=11136953 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200101043440101}}</ref>

Participants were pre-hypertensive or at stage 1 hypertension, and either ate a DASH-Diet or a diet reflecting an "average American Diet". During the intervention phase, participants ate their assigned diets containing three distinct levels of sodium in random order. Their blood pressure is monitored during the control period, and at all three intervention phases.<ref name="Sacks F 2001"/>

The study concluded that the effect of a reduced dietary sodium intake alone on blood pressure is substantial, and that the largest decrease in blood pressure occurred in those eating the DASH eating plan at the lowest sodium level (1,500 milligrams per day).<ref name="Sacks F 2001"/> However, this study is especially significant because participants in both the control and DASH diet group showed lowered blood pressure with decreased sodium alone.<ref name="Karanja N 2004"/>

In agreement with studies regarding salt sensitivity, participants of African descent showed high reductions in blood pressure. See [[Salt_and_cardiovascular_disease#Sodium_Sensitivity|sodium sensitivity]] below.<ref name="Sacks F 2001"/>

== Hypertension and Cardiovascular Disease ==

There has been strong evidence from [[epidemiological studies]], human and animal intervention experiments, supporting the links between high rate of salt intake, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.<ref name="Cappuccio">{{cite journal |last1=Cappuccio |first1=F. P |title=Salt and cardiovascular disease |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue=7599 |pages=859–60 |year=2007 |pmid=17463420 |pmc=1857801 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39175.364954.BE}}</ref> Short term studies have proven that a decrease in dietary salt intake will decrease blood pressure, irrespective of sex, race, age, physical activity level, and [[body mass]]. However, to properly study the effects of sodium intake levels on risk of development of cardiovascular disease, long term studies of large groups using both dietary and biochemical measures are necessary.<ref name="Cappuccio"/> Most of these studies, with a few exceptions, show [[statistical significance]] that groups with sodium reduced diets show lower incidences of cardiovascular disease in all demographics.<ref name="Cappuccio"/><ref name="Cook"/> A study by Cook and colleagues were the first to show reduction of cardiovascular disease after 15 years of sodium reduction in a randomised trial.<ref name="Cook">{{cite journal |last1=Cook |first1=N. R |last2=Cutler |first2=J. A |last3=Obarzanek |first3=E. |last4=Buring |first4=J. E |last5=Rexrode |first5=K. M |last6=Kumanyika |first6=S. K |last7=Appel |first7=L. J |last8=Whelton |first8=P.

More data is needed to support the conclusions of observational studies which suffer from design flaws.<ref name="Cook"/> Many of these studies are not large enough, nor last long enough to provide conclusions on clinical outcomes for the effect of dietary sodium intake on morbidity and mortality.<ref name="Cook"/> Previous mixed results and inconclusive interpretation of non-experimental studies may also root from the way sodium is measured in the study.<ref name="Cook"/>

=== Current Trends and Campaigns ===

According to the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Canadians in all age groups are consuming sodium between 45.1 - 98.8% above the upper limit set for their gender and age group.<ref name="CCHS">2004 Canadian Community Health Survey — Nutrition.

What we eat in America. Available from http://www.ars.usda.gov/service/docs.htm?docid=15044</ref> The majority of sodium consumed by North Americans is from processed and restaurant foods, while only a small portion is added during cooking or at the table.<ref name="CCHS"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mattes |first1=RD |last2=Donnelly |first2=D |title=Relative contributions of dietary sodium sources |journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=383–93 |year=1991 |pmid=1910064}}</ref>

== Sodium Sensitivity ==

A diet high in sodium increases the risk of hypertension in people with sodium sensitivity, corresponding to an increase in health risks associated with hypertensions including cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morimoto |first1=A |last2=Uzu |first2=T |last3=Fujii |first3=T |last4=Nishimura |first4=M |last5=Kuroda |first5=S |last6=Nakamura |first6=S |last7=Inenaga |first7=T |last8=Kimura |first8=G |title=Sodium sensitivity and cardiovascular events in patients with essential hypertension |journal=The Lancet |volume=350 |pages=1734–7 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)05189-1 |issue=9093}}</ref> 

Unfortunately, there is no universal definition of sodium sensitivity; the method to assess sodium sensitivity varies from one study to another. In most studies, sodium sensitivity is defined as the change in mean blood pressure corresponding to a decrease or increase of sodium intake. The method to assess sodium sensitivity includes the measurement of circulating fluid volume and peripheral vascular resistance. Several studies have shown a relationship between sodium sensitivity and the increase of circulating fluid volume or peripheral vascular resistance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wedler |first1=B |last2=Wiersbitzki |first2=M |last3=Gruska |first3=S |last4=Wolf |first4=E |last5=Luft |first5=FC |title=Definitions and characteristics of salt-sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure: should the diagnosis depend on diastolic blood pressure? |journal=Clinical and experimental hypertension. Part A, Theory and practice |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=1037–49 |year=1992 |pmid=1424217}}</ref>    

A number of factors have been found to be associated with sodium sensitivity. Demographic factors which affect sodium sensitivity include race, gender, and age.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite journal |last1=Weinberger |first1=MH |title=Salt sensitivity of blood pressure in humans |journal=Hypertension |volume=27 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=481–90 |year=1996 |pmid=8613190}}</ref> One study shows that the American population of African descent are significantly more salt sensitive than those Caucasians.<ref name="Sebastian A 1999">{{cite journal |last1=Morris Jr |first1=RC |last2=Sebastian |first2=A |last3=Forman |first3=A |last4=Tanaka |first4=M |last5=Schmidlin |first5=O |title=Normotensive salt sensitivity: effects of race and dietary potassium |journal=Hypertension |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=18–23 |year=1999 |pmid=9931076}}</ref> Women are found to be more sodium sensitive than men; one possible explanation is based on the fact that women have a tendency to consume more salt per unit weight, as women weigh less than men on average.<ref name="Sebastian A 1999"/> Several studies have shown that the increase in age is also associated with the occurrence of sodium sensitivity.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>

The difference in genetic makeup and family history has a significant impact on salt sensitivity, and is being studied more with improvement on the efficiencies and techniques of genetic testing.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> In both hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals, those with haptoglobin 1-1 phenotype are more likely to have sodium sensitivity than people with haptoglobin 2-1 or 2-2 phenotypes. More specifically, haptoglobin 2-2 phenotypes contribute to the characteristic of sodium-resistance in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Weinberger |first1=MH |last2=Miller |first2=JZ |last3=Fineberg |first3=NS |last4=Luft |first4=FC |last5=Grim |first5=CE |last6=Christian |first6=JC |title=Association of haptoglobin with sodium sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure |journal=Hypertension |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=443–6 |year=1987 |pmid=3653973}}</ref> Moreover, prevalence of a family history of hypertension is strongly linked with the occurrence of sodium sensitivity.  

The influence of physiological factors including renal function and insulin levels on sodium sensitivity are shown in various studies.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> One study concludes that the effect of renal failure on sodium sensitivity is substantial due to the contribution of decreasing the Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the kidney.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Koomans, HA |last2=Roos |first2=JC |last3=Boer |first3=P |last4=Geyskes |first4=GG |last5=Mees |first5=EJ |pmid=7040224 |title=Salt sensitivity of blood pressure in chronic renal failure.

== Potassium and hypertension ==

[[File:2009-07-22-salzverkostung-by-RalfR-03.jpg|thumb|Different salts contain different minerals contents]]

Possible mechanisms by which high intakes of dietary potassium can decreases risk of hypertension and instances of cardiovascular disease have been proposed but not extensively studied.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal |pmid=7733391 |last1=Young |first1=DB |year=1995 |pages=R825–37 |issue=4 Pt 2 |last2=Lin |volume=268 |journal=The American journal of physiology |first2=H |last3=McCabe |first3=RD |title=Potassium's cardiovascular protective mechanisms |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&pmid=7733391}}</ref> However studies have found a strong inverse association between long-term adequate to high rates of potassium intake and the development of cardiovascular diseases.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

The recommended dietary intake of potassium is higher than that of sodium.<ref name="Caggiula, AW 1985">{{cite journal |author1=AW Caggiula |last2=Wing |first2=RR |last3=Nowalk |first3=MP |last4=Milas |first4=NC |last5=Lee |first5=S |last6=Langford |first6=H |title=The measurement of sodium and potassium intake |pmid=4036845 |date=1985-09-01 |pages=391–8 |issue=3 |volume=42 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=4036845}}</ref> Unfortunately, the average absolute intake of potassium of studied populations is lower than that of sodium intake.<ref name="Caggiula, AW 1985"/> According to Statistics Canada, Canadian's potassium intake in all age groups are lower than recommended, while sodium intake greatly exceed recommended intake in every age group.<ref>2004 Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition.http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/2006004/article/sodium/4148995-eng.htm</ref>

It has been hypothesized that the ratio of potassium to sodium intake accounts for the large difference in the occurrence of hypertension between primitive cultures eating diets made up of mostly unprocessed foods and Western diets which tend to include highly processed foods.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

==Salt substitutes==
{{Main|Salt substitute}}

The growing awareness of excessive sodium consumption in connection with hypertension and cardiovascular disease has increased the usage of salt substitutes at both a consumer and industrial level.<ref name="meat">{{cite journal |last1=Desmond |first1=E |title=Reducing salt: A challenge for the meat industry |journal=Meat Science |volume=74 |pages=188–96 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.04.014 |pmid=22062728 |issue=1}}</ref>

On a consumer level, salt substitutes, which usually substitute a portion of sodium chloride content with [[potassium chloride]], can be used to increase the potassium to sodium consumption ratio.<ref name="meat"/> This change has been shown to blunt the effects of excess salt intake on hypertension and cardiovascular disease.<ref name="meat"/><ref name="US dept">US Dept of Health and Human Services, 2005 US Department of Health and Human Services (2005). 2005 Dietary guidelines for Americans. Available from <http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2005/document>.</ref> It has also been suggested that salt substitutes can be used to provide an essential portion of daily potassium intake, and may even be more economical than prescription potassium supplements.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sopko |first1=J. A. |title=Salt substitutes as a source of potassium |journal=JAMA |volume=238 |pages=608–10 |year=1977 |doi=10.1001/jama.238.7.608 |issue=7 |pmid=577961 |last2=Freeman |first2=RM}}</ref>

In the food industry, processes have been developed to create low-sodium versions of existing products.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sofos |first1=John N. |title=Influence of Sodium Tripolyphosphate on the Binding and Antimicrobial Properties of Reduced NaCl-Comminuted Meat Products |journal=Journal of Food Science |volume=50 |pages=1379–83 |year=1985 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1985.tb10481.x |issue=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=A Engstrom |last2=Tobelmann |first2=RC |last3=Albertson |first3=AM |title=Sodium intake trends and food choices |pmid=9022569 |date=1997-02-01 |pages=704S–707S |issue=2 |volume=65 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9022569}}</ref> The meat industry especially have developed and fine-tuned methods to decrease salt contents in processed meats without sacrificing consumer acceptance.<ref name="meat"/> Research demonstrates that salt substitutes such as potassium chloride, and synergistic compounds such as [[phosphates]], can be used to decrease salt content in meat products.<ref name="meat"/>

Note that there have been concerns with certain populations' use of potassium chloride as a substitute for salt as high potassium loads are dangerous for groups with [[diabetes]], [[Nephropathy|renal diseases]], or heart failure.<ref name="meat"/> The use of salts with minerals such as natural salts have also been tested, but like salt substitutes partially containing potassium, mineral salts produce a bitter taste above certain levels.<ref name="meat"/>
