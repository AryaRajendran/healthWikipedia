'''Ala-al-din abu Al-Hassan Ali ibn Abi-Hazm al-Qarshi al-Dimashqi''' ([[Arabic]]:  علاء الدين أبو الحسن عليّ بن أبي حزم القرشي الدمشقي ), known as '''Ibn al-Nafis''' ([[Arabic]]: ابن النفيس ), was an [[Arab]] physician who is mostly famous for being the first to describe the [[pulmonary circulation]] of the [[blood]].

He was born in 1213 in [[Damascus]]. He attended the Medical College Hospital ([[Bimaristan]] Al-Noori) in Damascus.  Apart from medicine, Ibn al-Nafis learned [[jurisprudence]], [[literature]] and [[theology]]. He became an expert on the [[Shafi'i]] school of jurisprudence and an expert [[physician]].<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1390327/?page=2 A FORGOTTEN CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD - Nih.gov]</ref>

In 1236, Al-Nafis moved to [[Egypt]].  He worked at the Al-Nassri Hospital, and subsequently at the Al-Mansouri Hospital, where he became chief of physicians and the [[Sultan]]’s personal physician. When he died in 1288, he donated his house, library and clinic to the Mansuriya Hospital.

[[Image:ibn al-nafis page.jpg|300px|thumb|The opening page of one of Ibn al-Nafis's medical works. This is probably a copy made in [[India]] during the 17th or 18th century.]]

The most voluminous of his books is ''Al-Shamil fi al-Tibb'', which was planned to be an encyclopedia comprising 300 volumes, but was not completed as a result of his death. The manuscript is available in [[Damascus]]. 

His book on [[ophthalmology]] is largely an original contribution. His most famous book is ''The Summary of Law'' (Mujaz al-Qanun). Another famous book, embodying his original contribution, was on the effects of diet on health, entitled ''Kitab al-Mukhtar fi al-Aghdhiya''.

His ''Al-Risalah al-Kamiliyyah fil Siera al-Nabawiyyah'', translated in the West under the title ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'', has been argued to be both the first [[Philosophical novel|theological novel]] and the first [[science fiction]] novel.

He also wrote a number of commentaries on the topics of law and medicine. His commentaries include one on [[Hippocrates]]' book, and several volumes on [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. Additionally, he wrote a commentary on [[Hunayn Ibn Ishaq]]'s book.

== Discovery of pulmonary circulation ==
{{Refimprove|date=April 2011}}

In 1924, an [[Egypt]]ian [[physician]], Muhyo Al-Deen Altawi, discovered a script titled, "Commentary on the Anatomy of Canon of Avicenna" in the [[Prussian State Library]] in [[Berlin]] while studying the history of Arab Medicine at the medical faculty of Albert Ludwig’s University in [[Germany]]. This script covers in detail the topics of [[anatomy]], [[pathology]] and [[physiology]]. This was the earliest description of [[pulmonary circulation]].<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1390327/?page=3 A FORGOTTEN CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD Pg3 - Nih.gov]</ref> 

The theory that was accepted, prior to Al-Nafis, was that of [[Galen]] in the 2nd century. Galen had theorized that the blood reaching the right side of the [[heart]] went through invisible pores in the [[cardiac septum]], to the left side of the heart, where it mixed with air to create spirit, and was then distributed to the body. According to Galen's views, the venous system was quite separate from the arterial system, except when they came in contact through the unseen pores. 

Based on his anatomical knowledge, Al-Nafis stated that:

<blockquote>"the blood from the right chamber of the heart must arrive at the left chamber but there is no direct pathway between them. The thick septum of the heart is not perforated and does not have visible pores as some people thought or invisible pores as Galen thought. The blood from the right chamber must flow through the vena arteriosa ([[pulmonary artery]]) to the lungs, spread through its substances, be mingled there with air, pass through the arteria venosa ([[pulmonary vein]]) to reach the left chamber of the heart and there form the vital spirit..." <ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KTWDxDEY-Q0C&pg=PA99 The Pursuit of Learning in the Islamic World, 610-2003 By Hunt Janin, Pg99]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ysB4DTRgh5sC&pg=PA295 Saints and saviours of Islam, By Hamid Naseem Rafiabadi, Pg295]</ref></blockquote>

Elsewhere in his book, he said:

<blockquote>"The heart has only two [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] ...and between these two there is absolutely no opening. Also dissection gives this lie to what they said, as the septum between these two cavities is much thicker than elsewhere. The benefit of this blood (that is in the right cavity) is to go up to the lungs, mix with what is in the lungs of air, then pass through the arteria venosa to the left cavity of the two cavities of the heart and of that mixture is created the animal spirit."</blockquote>

In describing the anatomy of the [[lungs]], Al-Nafis stated:

<blockquote>"The lungs are composed of parts, one of which is the [[bronchi]]; the second, the branches of the arteria venosa; and the third, the branches of the vena arteriosa, all of them connected by loose porous flesh."</blockquote>

He then added:

<blockquote>"the need of the lungs for the vena arteriosa is to transport to it the blood that has been thinned and warmed in the heart, so that what seeps through the pores of the branches of this vessel into the [[alveoli]] of the lungs may mix with what there is of air therein and combine with it, the resultant composite becoming fit to be spirit, when this mixing takes place in the left cavity of the heart. The mixture is carried to the left cavity by the arteria venosa." <ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1390327/?page=5 A FORGOTTEN CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD, Pg5 - Nih.gov]</ref> </blockquote>

Al-Nafis also postulated that nutrients for heart are extracted from the [[coronary arteries]]:

<blockquote>"again his (Avicenna's) statement that the blood that is in the right side is to nourish the heart is not true at all, for the nourishment to the heart is from the blood that goes through the vessels that permeate the body of the heart."</blockquote>
