'''Spondylosis''' is a term referring to degenerative [[osteoarthritis]] of the joints between the centre of the [[Vertebrae|spinal vertebrae]] and/or [[neural foramen|neural foraminae]]. If this condition occurs in the [[Zygapophysial joint|zygapophysial joints]], it can be considered [[facet syndrome]]. If severe, it may cause pressure on [[nerve|nerve roots]] with subsequent [[sensory system|sensory]] and/or [[motor system|motor]] disturbances, such as [[pain]], [[paresthesia]], or [[muscle weakness]] in the limbs.

When the space between two adjacent vertebrae narrows, compression of a nerve root emerging from the [[spinal cord]] may result in [[radiculopathy]] (sensory and motor disturbances, such as severe pain in the neck, shoulder, arm, back, and/or leg, accompanied by muscle weakness).  Less commonly, direct pressure on the spinal cord (typically in the cervical spine) may result in [[myelopathy]], characterized by global weakness, gait dysfunction, loss of balance, and loss of bowel and/or bladder control. The patient may experience a phenomenon of shocks (paresthesia) in hands and legs because of nerve compression and [[Ischemia|lack of blood flow]]. If vertebrae of the [[neck]] are involved it is labelled [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical]] spondylosis.  Lower back spondylosis is labeled [[lumbar vertebrae|lumbar]] spondylosis.

==Causes==
* [[Repetitive strain injury]] (RSI) caused due to lifestyle without ergonomic care, e.g., while working in front of computers, driving, traveling, intense work in farm, etc. 
* Age related degeneration
*Spondylosis will not show up on regular xrays.  Regular x-rays may appear completely normal so some physicians will not suspect this as a diagnosis and may say the pain is psychosomatic.  Only an MRI without contrast test or higher will show this as a possible diagnosis.(Newman,Santiago 2013)
*Spondylosis is not limited to a specific age group and can affect a person at any age, however, older people are more susceptible.(Newman, Santiago 2013)

==Diagnosis==
* [[Spurling's test]] is performed by rotating the patient's head and placing downward pressure on it.  A positive sign is neck or shoulder pain on the ipsilateral side, that is, the side to which the head is rotated.  This is somewhat predictive of cervical spondylosis.
* Lhermitte sign, feeling of electrical shock with neck flexion; 
* reduced range of motion of the neck, the most frequent objective finding on physical examination

==Treatment==
Treatment is usually conservative in nature. Patient education on lifestyle modifications and [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs), [[physical therapy]], [[chiropractic manipulative therapy]] (CMT), and [[osteopathic manipulative treatment]] (OMT) have been shown to manage such conditions {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}. Other alternative therapies such as [[massage]], trigger-point therapy, [[yoga]] and [[acupuncture]] may be of limited benefit{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}.  Surgery is occasionally performed.

Many of the treatments for cervical spondylosis have not been subjected to rigorous, controlled trials.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Surgery is advocated for cervical radiculopathy in patients who have intractable pain, progressive symptoms, or weakness that fails to improve with conservative therapy. Surgical indications for cervical spondylosis with myelopathy (CSM) remain somewhat controversial, but "most clinicians recommend operative therapy over conservative therapy for moderate-to-severe myelopathy."  (Baron, M.E.)

Physical therapy may be effective for restoring range of motion, flexibility, and core strengthening. There is no evidence for the effectiveness of osteopathic or chiropractic care. Rarely, chiropractic care to the cervical spine results in vascular emergencies like [[carotid artery dissection]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Decompressive therapies (i.e. manual mobilization, mechanical traction) may also help alleviate pain. However, physical therapy and chiropractic cannot "cure" the degeneration, and some people view that strong compliance with postural modification is necessary to realize maximum benefit from decompression, adjustments, and flexibility rehabilitation.

It is often argued, however, that the cause of spondylosis is simply old age, and that posture modification treatment is often practiced by those who have a financial interest (such as Worker's Compensation)<ref>Rana, Sandeep, "[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1144952-overview Cervical Spondylosis, Diagnosis and Management: eMedicine Neurology]", "http://emedicine.medscape.com" (March 24, 2010).</ref> in proving that it is caused by work conditions and poor physical habits. Understanding anatomy is the key to conservative management of spondylosis.

== Surgery ==
Many surgical procedures have been developed to alleviate the signs and symptoms associated with spondylosis. The [[vertebral column]] can be approached by the surgeon from the front, side, or rear. [[Osteophytes]] and sometimes portions of an intervertebral disc are commonly removed in an effort to relieve pressure on adjacent nerve roots and/or the spinal cord.

==Complications==
A major problem related to this disease is [[Vertebrobasilar_insufficiency |vertebrobasilar insufficiency]]. This is a result of the vertebral artery becoming occluded as it passes up in the transverse foramen. The spinal joints become stiff in cervical spondylosis. Thus the [[chondrocytes]] which maintain the disc become deprived of nutrition and die. The weakened disc bulges and grows out as a result of incoming osteophytes.
