Folk epidemiology  of [[autism]] is derived from [[folk science]], and refers to the popular beliefs about the origin of autism.<ref name="1.">Moore, A.; Stilgoe, J., Experts and Anecdotes the Role of "Anecdotal Evidence" In Public Scientific Controversies. Sci. Technol. Hum. Values 2009, 34 (5), 654-677.</ref> Using the rare occurrences or trends of autism in order to unify the complex disorder creates these epidemiologies.<ref name="1."/>  The most popular folk epidemiologies for autism are influenced by [[anecdotal evidence]].<ref name="1."/> This erroneous epidemiology has dominated over [[scientific evidence]] in society due to the miscommunication of [[scientific research]].<ref name="2.">Sharts-Hopko, N. C., ISSUES IN Pediatric Immunization. Mcn-the American Journal of Maternal-Child Nursing 2009, 34 (2), 80-88.</ref>

==Background==

Folk epidemiologies of autism enter into the [[mass media]] before scientific evidence can support or disclaim the beliefs.<ref name="1."/><ref name="3.">Taylor, B. Vaccines and the Changing Epidemiology of Autism. Child Care Health and Development [Online] 2006, 32(5), pp 511-519.</ref> For example,  in 1998 [[Andrew Wakefield]] published an article in ''[[The Lancet]]'' containing a folk epidemiology that [[vaccines]] caused autism.<ref name="3."/> The anecdotal evidence for the folk epidemiology in this article entered into the mass media before the article could be retracted for the lack of scientific evidence.<ref name="1."/><ref name="3."/>

===Parents===

Folk epidemiology of autism is used by parents with autistic children in order to comprehend their child’s disorder.<ref name="1."/> The [[physicians]]' and [[scientific research community]]'s lack of communication and scientific evidence on autism leaves these parents browsing [[alternative media]] in search of answers to autism.<ref name="1."/><ref name="2."/> Most of the alternative media these parents come across are biased towards folk epidemiologies.<ref name="4.">Gerber, J. S.; Offit, P. A., Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses. Clinical Infectious Diseases 2009, 48 (4), 456-461.</ref> With little to no exposure of scientific evidence, parents ignorantly believe the folk epidemiologies of autism.<ref name="2."/><ref name="4."/>

===Researchers===

The scientific researchers lack of explanation for why the studies on the origin of autism were unsuccessful, resulted in people questioning scientific evidence rather than anecdotal evidence.<ref name="5.">Wallace, A. An Epidemic of Fear: How Panicked Parents Skipping Shots Endangers Us 
All. Wired.  [Online] 2009, Nov. [http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/all/1]</ref> For instance, scientific researchers are unsuccessful in clarifying the [[adverse effects]] and benefits of vaccines, causing parents to decide not to get their child vaccinated for fear of the negative side-effects.<ref name="3."/><ref name="5."/> The researchers’ neglect to be informative about their research allows folk epidemiologies to be more accepted into the society.<ref name="5."/>

==Sources and Influences==

===Mass Media===

It is the responsibility of the mass media to entertain its audience.<ref name="3."/> The mass media has become biased towards using folk epidemiology of autism in order to create better entertainment.<ref name="3."/> The folk epidemiology of autism provides answers unlike the scientific evidence that only has disclaimed potential causes of autism.<ref name="4."/><ref name="5."/>  The constant influence from the biased mass media has resulted in people being highly aware of false epidemiologies and unaware of the scientific research.<ref name="3."/> The [[media influence]] has merely strengthened the acceptance of folk epidemiologies for autism.<ref name="3."/><ref name="5."/>

===Public Figures===

Public figures (see [[celebrity]]) address the issues of autism in a way that is easy to understand.<ref name="5."/> These simple explanations presented by public figures, such as [[Jenny McCarthy]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]] are a greater influence on people's decisions than the scientific research presented by scientific researchers.<ref name="5."/> The scientific research on autism has little influence on people’s mindset since the scientific researchers give no explanations on the subject of autism.<ref name="2."/><ref name="5."/>

==Antagonists==

Until the retraction of Andrew Wakefield’s article there has been little opposition towards the folk epidemiologies of autism for many reasons.<ref name="5."/> Most people believe and are influenced by the evidence provided by the media, which causes large controversies when people or groups disagree with the media’s evidence.<ref name="5."/> [[Paul Offit]] is one of the few advocates who is publicly against the folk epidemiologies of autism.<ref name="5."/> He believes people need to be more informed about the scientific evidence.<ref name="5."/> Offit wants more money to go into the new scientific research on the cause of autism.<ref name="5."/> (also see [[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health]] and [[Immunization Alliance]])

==Consequences==

The false epidemiology of autism has caused new research for the origin of autism to suffer.<ref name="5."/> More resources are put into the research of folk epidemiologies than for the new scientific research for autism.<ref name="5."/> An example of this is illustrated in the [[vaccine controversy]].<ref name="5."/> People and groups continue to push for more research on the link between vaccines and autism.<ref name="4."/><ref name="5."/> There have been thirteen studies that properly followed the [[scientific method]] and contained large numbers of participants that failed to connect autism to the [[measles-mumps-rubella vaccine]].<ref name="4."/> There were seven well-constructed studies, which attempted to correlate autism to [[thiomersal]] in vaccines and were unsuccessful.<ref name="4."/>

As a result of folk epidemiology of autism, the knowledge of scientific breakthroughs on autism are not made publicly available.<ref name="4."/><ref name="5."/><ref name="6."/> The research for the root of autism is delayed due to the small amount of money going into the new research.<ref name="4."/><ref name="5."/> Researchers have  started to investigate maternal and paternal ages as the root for autism.<ref name="6.">Saha, S.; A. G. Barnett A.G.; et al. Maternal Age and Paternal Age Are Associated  
With Distinct Childhood Behavioural Outcomes In A General Population Birth Cohort. Schizophrenia Research [Online] 2009, 115(2-3), pp 130-135.</ref> (see [[causes of autism]]) The evidence found is promising, but needs to be investigated further with more monetary support and more support from the society.<ref name="6."/>
