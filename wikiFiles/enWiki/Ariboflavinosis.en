'''Ariboflavinosis''' (pronounced "AY-rybo-flayvin-OH-sis") is the medical condition caused by deficiency of [[riboflavin]] (vitamin B<sub>2</sub>).  Ariboflavinosis is most often seen in association with [[protein-energy malnutrition]], and also in cases of [[alcoholism]].

It was originally known as ''pellagra sin pellagra'' (pellagra without pellagra), as it exhibits certain similarities to the [[niacin]] deficiency [[pellagra]]. 

The [[United States]] [[Recommended Daily Allowance]] (RDA) for riboflavin ranges from 1.1 to 1.3 milligrams per day for healthy adults to as high as 1.6&nbsp;mg/day for pregnant or nursing women.

==Causes==
The most common cause of riboflavin deficiency is an inadequate diet; thus, it occurs most frequently in populations consuming limited quantities of riboflavin-containing foods such as [[meat]]s, [[egg (food)|egg]]s, [[milk]], [[cheese]], [[yogurt]], [[leafy green vegetable]]s and [[whole grain]]s. Riboflavin deficiency can also occur in those with impaired [[liver]] function, which prevents proper use of the vitamin. Borderline riboflavin deficiency as a consequence of certain [[anti-retroviral]] medications has also been known to cause acute [[lactic acidosis]].

An animal model of [[riboflavin kinase]] deficiency has been identified.<ref name="pmid19641494">{{cite journal |author=Yazdanpanah B |title=Riboflavin kinase couples TNF receptor 1 to NADPH oxidase |journal=Nature |volume=460 |issue=7259 |pages=1159–1163 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19641494 |author-separator=, |author2=Wiegmann K |author3=Tchikov V |display-authors=3 |last4=Krut |first4=Oleg |last5=Pongratz |first5=Carola |last6=Schramm |first6=Michael |last7=Kleinridders |first7=Andre |last8=Wunderlich |first8=Thomas |last9=Kashkar |first9=Hamid | doi=10.1038/nature08206}}</ref>

==Presentation==
The signs and symptoms of riboflavin deficiency typically include sore throat with redness and swelling of the mouth and throat [[mucosa]], [[cheilosis]] and angular [[stomatitis]] (cracking of the lips and corners of the mouth), [[glossitis]] (magenta tongue with atrophy), [[seborrheic dermatitis]] or pseudo-syphilis (moist, scaly skin particularly affecting the [[scrotum]] or [[labia majora]] and the nasolabial folds), and a decreased [[erythrocyte|red blood cell]] count with normal cell size and [[hemoglobin]] content (normochromic normocytic [[anemia]]).

Riboflavin deficiency is usually found together with other nutrient deficiencies, particularly of the other water-soluble [[vitamin]]s. [[Phototherapy]] to treat [[jaundice]] in infants can cause increased degradation of riboflavin, leading to deficiency if not monitored closely. Persons with chronic alcoholism can have impaired absorption of riboflavin and other vitamins such as [[thiamine]] (see [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]]).

Studies of the [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkoman]] people of [[Iran]], who have a significantly increased incidence of esophageal [[cancer]], have shown some relationship between chronic riboflavin deficiency and the onset of esophageal malignancies. 

One study of pregnant women has found that riboflavin-deficient women were 4.7 times more likely to develop [[preeclampsia]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wacker J, Frühauf J, Schulz M, Chiwora FM, Volz J, Becker K |title=Riboflavin deficiency and preeclampsia |journal=Obstetrics and gynecology |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=38–44 |year=2000 |pmid=10862839 |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(00)00847-4}}</ref> though the mechanism for this is not known.

==Treatment==
Treatment involves a diet which includes an adequate amount of riboflavin. In cases related to weakened liver function, intravenous supplementation may be required.
