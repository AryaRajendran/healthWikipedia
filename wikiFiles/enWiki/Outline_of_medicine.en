== General concepts ==
*[[Anatomy]] &ndash; study of the physical structure of [[organism]]s. In contrast to ''macroscopic'' or ''gross anatomy'', ''cytology'' and ''histology'' are concerned with microscopic structures.
*[[Biochemistry]] &ndash; study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms, especially the structure and function of their chemical components.
*[[Biostatistics]] &ndash; application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense. A knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning, evaluation, and interpretation of medical research. It is also fundamental to [[epidemiology]] and evidence-based medicine.
*[[cell biology|Cytology]] &ndash; microscopic study of individual [[cell (biology)|cells]].
*[[Embryology]] &ndash; study of the early development of organisms.
*[[Epidemiology]] &ndash; study of the demographics of disease processes, and includes, but is not limited to, the study of [[epidemics]].
*[[Genetics]] &ndash; study of genes, and their role in [[biological inheritance]].
*[[Histology]] &ndash; study of the structures of [[biological tissue]]s by light [[microscopy]], electron microscopy and [[immunohistochemistry]].
*[[Immunology]] &ndash; study of the [[immune system]], which includes the innate and adaptive immune system in humans, for example. 
*[[Medical ethics]] &ndash; system of [[moral principle]]s that apply [[values]] and [[judgments]] to the practice of [[medicine]].
*[[Microbiology]] &ndash; study of [[microorganism]]s, including [[protozoa]], [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], and [[virus]]es.
*[[Neuroscience]] includes those disciplines of science that are related to the study of the [[nervous system]]. A main focus of neuroscience is the biology and physiology of the human [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].
*[[Nutrition]] &ndash; study of the relationship of food and drink to health and disease, especially in determining an optimal diet. Medical nutrition therapy is done by dietitians and is prescribed for [[diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]]s, weight and eating [[mental illness|disorder]]s, allergies, [[malnutrition]], and [[neoplasia|neoplastic]] diseases.
*[[Pathology as a science]] &ndash; study of disease&ndash;the causes, course, progression and resolution thereof.
*[[Pharmacology]] &ndash; study of [[Medication|drug]]s and their actions.
*[[Physiology]] &ndash; study of the normal functioning of the body and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.
*[[Psychology]] &ndash; an academic and applied discipline that involves the scientific study of [[mental functions]] and [[behaviors]].
*[[Toxicology]] &ndash; study of hazardous effects of drugs and [[poison]]s.
