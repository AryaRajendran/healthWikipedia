'''Δ<sub>P</sub>''' ('''Delta P''') is a mathematical term used to illustrate a change (Δ) in pressure (<sub>P</sub>).

==Uses==
*[[Young–Laplace equation]]

===Darcy–Weisbach equation===
As used in the '''[[Darcy–Weisbach equation]]''' — Given that the [[head loss]] ''h<sub>f</sub>'' expresses the [[pressure]] loss ''&Delta;p'' as the height of a column of fluid,

:<math>\Delta p = \rho \cdot g \cdot h_f</math>

where ρ is the density of the fluid, the Darcy–Weisbach equation can also be written in terms of pressure loss:

:<math>\Delta p = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{\rho V^2}{2}</math>

===Lung compliance===
In general, compliance is defined by the change in volume ([[ΔV]]) versus the associated change in pressure (ΔP), or [[ΔV/ΔP]]. During [[mechanical ventilation]], compliance can be influenced by 3 key physiologic factors:
#[[Lung compliance]]
#[[Chest wall compliance]]
#[[Airway resistance]]

Lung compliance is influenced by a variety of primary abnormalities of [[lung parenchyma]], both chronic and acute. [[Airway resistance]] is typically increased by [[bronchospasm]] and airway secretions. Chest wall compliance can be decreased by fixed abnormalities (e.g. [[kyphoscoliosis]], [[morbid obesity]]) or more variable problems driven by patient agitation while intubated.<ref name="pmid21866369">{{cite journal| author=Dellamonica J, Lerolle N, Sargentini C, Beduneau G, Di Marco F, Mercat A et al.| title=PEEP-induced changes in lung volume in acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Calculating Compliance on [[minute volume]] (V<sub>E</sub>: [[ΔV]] is always defined by [[tidal volume]] (V<sub>T</sub>), but ΔP is different for the measurement of dynamic vs. static compliance.

====Dynamic Compliance (C<sub>dyn</sub>)====
<math>C_{dyn} = \frac{{V_T}}{{PIP-PEEP}}</math>

where PIP = [[peak inspiratory pressure]] (the maximum pressure during inspiration), and PEEP = [[positive end expiratory pressure]]. Alterations in airway resistance, [[lung compliance]] and chest wall compliance influence C<sub>dyn</sub>.

====Static Compliance (C<sub>stat</sub>)====
:<math>C_{stat} = \frac{{V_T}}{{P_{plat}-PEEP}}</math>
where P<sub>plat</sub> = plateau pressure. P<sub>plat</sub> is measured at the end of inhalation and prior to exhalation using an inspiratory hold maneuver. During this maneuver, airflow is transiently (~0.5 sec) discontinued, which eliminates the effects of airway resistance. P<sub>plat</sub> is never > PIP and is typically < 3-5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O lower than PIP when airway resistance is normal.
