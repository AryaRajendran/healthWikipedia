'''Stem-cell therapy''' is an intervention strategy that introduces new adult stem cells into damaged tissue in order to treat disease or injury. Many [[medical research]]ers believe that stem-cell treatments have the potential to change the face of human disease and alleviate suffering.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lindvall |first1=O. |last2=Kokaia |first2=Z. |year=2006 |title=Stem cells for the treatment of neurological disorders |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue= 7097| doi = 10.1038/nature04960 | pmid=16810245 |pages=1094–1096 }}</ref> The ability of [[stem cell]]s to self-renew and give rise to subsequent generations with variable degrees of differentiation capacities,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81692-X |author=Weissman IL |title=Stem cells: units of development, units of regeneration, and units in evolution |journal=Cell |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=157–68 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10647940 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674(00)81692-X}} as cited in {{cite journal |author=Gurtner GC, Callaghan MJ, Longaker MT |title=Progress and potential for regenerative medicine |journal=Annu.

{{Further|Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation}}
For over 30 years, bone-marrow, and more recently, umbilical-cord blood stem cells, have been used to treat [[cancer]] patients with conditions such as [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]].<ref name=NCI>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/bone-marrow-transplant Bone Marrow Transplantation and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation] In National Cancer Institute Fact Sheet web site.

== Potential treatments ==

===Brain damage===
Stroke and traumatic brain injury lead to cell death, characterized by a loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes within the brain. Healthy adult brains contain [[neural stem cell]]s which divide to maintain general stem cell numbers, or become [[progenitor cells]]. In healthy adult animals, progenitor cells migrate within the brain and function primarily to maintain neuron populations for olfaction (the sense of smell). In pregnancy and after injury, this system appears to be regulated by growth factors and can increase the rate at which new brain matter is formed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Although the reparative process appears to initiate following trauma to the brain, substantial recovery is rarely observed in adults, suggesting a lack of robustness.

Stem cells may also be used to treat brain degeneration, such as in [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name=NIH>[http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/basics6Stem Cell Basics: What are the potential uses of human stem cells and the obstacles that must be overcome before these potential uses will be realized?] ['''<-- bad link'''].

Pharmacological activation of an endogenous population of neural stem cells / neural precursor cells by soluble factors has been reported to induce powerful neuroprotection and behavioral recovery in adult rat models of neurological disorder through a signal transduction pathway involving the phosphorylation of STAT3 on the serine residue and subsequent Hes3 expression increase ([[Hes3 signaling axis|STAT3-Ser/Hes3 Signaling Axis]]). <ref>{{cite journal |author=Androutsellis-Theotokis A, Leker RR, Soldner F, ''et al.'' |title=Notch signalling regulates stem cell numbers in vitro and in vivo |journal=Nature |volume=442 |issue=7104 |pages=823–6 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16799564 |doi=10.1038/nature04940 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Androutsellis-Theotokis A, Rueger MA, Park DM, ''et al.'' |title=Targeting neural precursors in the adult brain rescues injured dopamine neurons |journal=Proc.

===Stem Cell Technologies===
Stem cell technology gives hope of effective treatment for a variety of malignant and non-malignant diseases through the rapid developing field that combines the efforts of cell biologists, geneticists, and clinicians. Stem cells are defined as totipotent progenitor cells capable of self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. Stem cells survive well and show steady division in culture which then causes them the ideal targets for vitro manipulation. Research into solid tissue stem cells has not made the same progress as haematopoietic stem cells because of the difficulty of reproducing the necessary and precise 3D arrangements and tight cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions that exist in solid organs. Yet, the ability of tissue stem cells to assimilate into the tissue cytoarchitecture under the control of the host microenvironment and developmental cues, makes them ideal for cell replacement therapy.

===Cancer===
The development of gene therapy strategies for treatment of intra-cranial [[tumour]]s offers much promise, and has shown to be successful in the treatment of some dogs;<ref>{{cite journal |last1=LeCouteur |first1=R. A. |year=2008 |title=Current concepts in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumours in dogs and cats |journal=Journal of Small Animal Practice |volume=40 |issue=9 |pages=411–416 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-5827.1999.tb03113.x |pmid=10516946}}</ref> although research in this area is still at an early stage. Using conventional techniques, [[brain cancer]] is difficult to treat because it spreads so rapidly. Researchers at the [[Harvard Medical School]] transplanted human neural stem cells into the brain of rodents that received intracranial tumours. Within days, the cells migrated into the cancerous area and produced [[cytosine deaminase]], an enzyme that converts a non-toxic pro-drug into a chemotheraputic agent. As a result, the injected substance was able to reduce the tumor mass by 81 percent. The stem cells neither [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] nor turned [[tumorigenic]].<ref>[http://www.mult-sclerosis.org/news/Dec2000/StemCellDebatePartII.html Stem Cells Tapped to Replenish Organs] thescientist.com, Nov 2000. By Douglas Steinberg</ref>

Some researchers believe that the key to finding a cure for cancer is to inhibit proliferation of [[cancer stem cell]]s. Accordingly, current cancer treatments are designed to kill cancer cells. However, conventional chemotherapy treatments cannot discriminate between cancerous cells and others. Stem-cell therapies may serve as potential treatments for cancer.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2004/08/64549 "Cancer Stem Cells Hint at Cure" at wired.com]</ref>
Research on treating Lymphoma using adult stem cells is underway and has had human trials. Essentially, chemotherapy is used to completely destroy the patients own lymphocytes, and stem cells injected, eventually replacing the immune system of the patient with that of the healthy donor.

===Spinal-cord injury===
A team of Korean researchers reported on November 25, 2003, that they had transplanted multipotent adult stem cells from umbilical cord blood to a patient suffering from a [[spinal-cord injury]] and that following the procedure, she could walk on her own without difficulty. The patient had not been able to stand up for roughly 19 years. For the unprecedented clinical test, the scientists isolated [[adult stem cells]] from umbilical cord blood and then injected them into the damaged part of the spinal cord.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kang KS, Kim SW, Oh YH, ''et al.'' |title=A 37-year-old spinal cord-injured female patient, transplanted of multipotent stem cells from human UC blood, with improved sensory perception and mobility, both functionally and morphologically: a case study |journal=Cytotherapy |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=368–73 |year=2005 |pmid=16162459 |doi=10.1080/14653240500238160 |url=}}</ref><ref>Team co-headed by researchers at [[Chosun University]], [[Seoul National University]] and the [http://www.seoulcord.co.kr/bin/main.asp Seoul Cord Blood Bank] (SCB) [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1477865/Umbilical-cord-cells-allow-paralysed-woman-to-walk.html Umbilical cord cells 'allow paralysed woman to walk'] By Roger Highfield, Science Editor.

According to the October 7, 2005 issue of ''[[The Week]]'', [[University of California, Irvine]] researchers transplanted multipotent human fetal-derived neural stem cells into paralyzed mice, resulting in locomotor improvements four months later. The observed recovery was associated with differentiation of transplanted cells into new neurons and [[oligodendrocytes]]- the latter of which forms the [[myelin sheath]] around axons of the central nervous system, thus insulating neural impulses and facilitating communication with the brain.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16172374 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0507063102 | volume=102 | issue=39 | title=Human neural stem cells differentiate and promote locomotor recovery in spinal cord-injured mice | pmc=1216836 | year=2005 | month=September | author=Cummings BJ, Uchida N, Tamaki SJ, ''et al.'' | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | pages=14069–74}}</ref>

In January 2005, researchers at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] differentiated human [[blastocyst stem cell]]s into neural stem cells, then into pre-mature [[motor neuron]]s, and finally into spinal motor neurons, the cell type that, in the human body, transmits [[message]]s from the [[brain]] to the [[spinal cord]] and subsequently mediates motor function in the periphery. The newly generated motor neurons exhibited electrical activity, the signature action of [[neuron]]s. Lead researcher Su-Chun Zhang described the process as "[teaching] the blastocyst stem cells to change step by step, where each step has different conditions and a strict window of time."{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} 	

Transformation of blastocyst stem cells into motor neurons had eluded researchers for decades.  While Zhang's findings were a significant contribution to the field, the ability of transplanted neural cells to establish communication with neighboring cells remains unclear. Accordingly, studies using chicken embryos as a model organism can be an effective proof-of-concept experiment.  If functional, the new cells could be used to treat [[disease]]s like [[Lou Gehrig's disease]], [[muscular dystrophy]], and spinal cord injuries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Current studies vary greatly in cell procuring techniques, cell types, cell administration timing and procedures, and studied parameters, making it very difficult to make comparisons. Comparative studies are therefore currently needed.

Stem-cell therapy for treatment of myocardial infarction usually makes use of autologous bone marrow stem cells (a specific type or all), however other types of adult stem cells may be used, such as adipose-derived stem cells.<ref>Paul, A., Srivastava, S., Chen, G., Shum-Tim, D. & Prakash, S.

The first successful integration of human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes in guinea pigs (mouse hearts beat too fast) was reported in August 2012. The contraction strength was measured four weeks after the guinea pigs underwent simulated heart attacks and cell treatment. The cells contracted synchronously with the existing cells, but it is unknown if the positive results were produced mainly from paracrine as opposed to direct electromechanical effects from the human cells. Future work will focus on how to get the cells to engraft more strongly around the scar tissue. Whether treatments from embryonic or adult bone marrow stem cells will prove more effective remains to be seen.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/guinea-pig-hearts-beat-with-human-cells-1.11123 Guinea pig hearts beat with human cells : Nature News & Comment<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Hematopoiesis (blood-cell formation)===
The specificity of the human immune-cell repertoire is what allows the human body to defend itself from rapidly adapting antigens. However, the immune system is vulnerable to degradation upon the pathogenesis of disease, and because of the critical role that it plays in overall defense, its degradation is often fatal to the organism as a whole. Diseases of hematopoietic cells are called [[hematopathology]]. The specificity of the immune cells is what allows recognition of foreign antigens, causing further challenges in the treatment of immune disease. Identical matches between donor and recipient must be made for successful transplantation treatments, but matches are uncommon, even between first-degree relatives. Research using both hematopoietic adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells has provided insight into the possible mechanisms and methods of treatment for many of these ailments.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Fully mature human [[red blood cells]] may be generated ''[[ex vivo]]'' by [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s (HSCs), which are precursors of red blood cells. In this process, HSCs are grown together with [[stromal cell]]s, creating an environment that mimics the conditions of bone marrow, the natural site of red-blood-cell growth. [[Erythropoietin]], a [[growth factor]], is added, coaxing the stem cells to complete terminal differentiation into red blood cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giarratana MC, Kobari L, Lapillonne H, ''et al.'' |title=Ex vivo generation of fully mature human red blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells |journal=Nat.

===Baldness===
[[Hair]] follicles also contain stem cells, and some researchers predict research on these follicle stem cells may lead to successes in treating [[baldness]] through an activation of the stem cells progenitor cells. This treatment is expected to work by activating already existing stem cells on the scalp. Later treatments may be able to simply signal follicle stem cells to give off chemical signals to nearby follicle cells which have shrunk during the [[aging]] process, which in turn respond to these signals by regenerating and once again making healthy hair.  Most recently, Dr. Aeron Potter of the [[University of California]] has claimed that stem-cell therapy led to a significant and visible improvement in follicular hair growth {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}.  Results from his experiments are under review by the journal [[Science (journal)]].

===Missing teeth===<!-- This section is linked from [[Dentistry]] -->
In 2004, scientists at [[King's College London]] discovered a way to cultivate a complete tooth in mice<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=P8&targetRule=10&xml=%2Fconnected%2F2004%2F02%2F17%2Fecntee15.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | accessdate=May 24, 2010 | first=Graeme | last=Archer | title=Technology}}</ref> and were able to grow them stand-alone in the laboratory. Researchers are confident that this technology can be used to grow live teeth in human patients.	

In theory, stem cells taken from the patient could be coaxed in the lab into turning into a tooth bud which, when implanted in the gums, will give rise to a new tooth, and would be expected to grow within two months.<ref>[http://whyfiles.org/shorties/147tooth/ Teeth from scratch<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It will fuse with the jawbone and release chemicals that encourage nerves and blood vessels to connect with it. The process is similar to what happens when humans grow their original adult teeth.

===Blindness and vision impairment===
Since 2003, researchers have successfully transplanted corneal stem cells into damaged eyes to restore vision. "Sheets of retinal cells used by the team are harvested from aborted fetuses, which some people find objectionable."  When these sheets are transplanted over the damaged [[cornea]], the stem cells stimulate renewed repair, eventually restore vision.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=15535 Fetal tissue restores lost sight] MedicalNewsToday.

The group, led by Dr.  [[Sheraz Daya]], was able to successfully use adult stem cells obtained from the patient, a relative, or even a [[cadaver]]. Further rounds of trials are ongoing.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4495419.stm BBC NEWS | England | Southern Counties | Stem cells used to restore vision]</ref>

In April 2005, doctors in the UK transplanted [[corneal]] stem cells from an organ donor to the [[cornea]] of Deborah Catlyn, a woman who was blinded in one eye when acid was thrown in her eye at a nightclub. The cornea, which is the transparent window of the eye, is a particularly suitable site for transplants. In fact, the first successful human transplant was a [[cornea transplant]]. The absence of blood vessels within the cornea makes this area a relatively easy target for transplantation. The majority of corneal transplants carried out today are due to a degenerative disease called [[keratoconus]].

[[The University Hospital (Newark, New Jersey)|The University Hospital]] of New Jersey reports that the success rate for growth of new cells from transplanted stem cells varies from 25 percent to 70 percent.<ref>[http://www.theuniversityhospital.com/healthlink/archives/articles/limbalstem.html ] The University Hospital of New Jersey, 2002</ref>

===Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis===
Stem cells have resulted in significant locomotor improvements in rats with an [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]-like disease. In a rodent model that closely mimics the human form of ALS, animals were injected with a virus to kill the spinal cord motor nerves which mediate movement.  Animals subsequently received stem cells in the spinal cord. Transplanted cells migrated to the sites of injury, contributed to regeneration of the ablated nerve cells, and restored locomotor function.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.285.13.1691 |author=Vastag B |title=Stem cells step closer to the clinic: paralysis partially reversed in rats with ALS-like disease |journal=JAMA |volume=285 |issue=13 |pages=1691–3 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11277806 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11277806}}</ref>

The recovery was almost 100 percent, as shown both in behavioral tests and objective brain chemistry tests. Behavioral tests and learning scores of the treated mice showed rapid improvement after treatment, providing results that rivaled non-treated mice. On the molecular level, brain chemistry of the treated animals was also restored to normal. Through the work, which was supported by the US National Institutes of Health, the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation and the Israel anti-drug authorities, the researchers discovered that the stem cells worked even in cases where most of the cells died out in the host brain.

The scientists found that before they die the neural stem cells succeed in inducing the host brain to produce large numbers of stem cells which repair the damage. These findings, which answered a major question in the stem cell research community, were published in January 2008 in the leading journal, [[Molecular Psychiatry]]. Scientists are now developing procedures to administer the neural stem cells in the least invasive way possible - probably via blood vessels, making therapy practical and clinically feasible. Researchers also plan to work on developing methods to take cells from the patient's own body, turn them into stem cells, and then transplant them back into the patient's blood via the blood stream. Aside from decreasing the chances of immunological rejection, the approach will also eliminate the controversial ethical issues involved in the use of stem cells from human embryos.<ref>[http://web.israel21c.net/bin/en.jsp?enDispWho=Articles^l2394&enPage=BlankPage&enDisplay=view&enDispWhat=object&enVersion=0&enZone=Health&] ISRAEL21c > Israeli scientists reverse brain birth defects using stem cells.

===Diabetes===
[[Diabetes]] patients lose the function of [[insulin]]-producing [[beta cell]]s within the pancreas.

====Transplantation====
Human embryonic stem cells may be grown in cell culture and stimulated to form insulin-producing cells that can be transplanted into the patient.

However, clinical success is highly dependent on the development of the following procedures:<ref name=NIH/>

* Transplanted cells should proliferate
* Transplanted cells should differentiate in a site-specific manner
* Transplanted cells should survive in the recipient (prevention of [[transplant rejection]])
* Transplanted cells should integrate within the targeted tissue
* Transplanted cells should integrate into the host circuitry and restore function

===Orthopaedics===

Clinical case reports in the treatment  [[orthopaedic]] conditions have been reported.  To date, the focus in the literature for musculoskeletal care appears to be on mesenchymal stem cells.

=== Wound healing===
Stem cells can also be used to stimulate the growth of human tissues. In an adult, wounded tissue is most often replaced by scar tissue, which is characterized in the skin by disorganized collagen structure, loss of hair follicles and irregular vascular structure. In the case of wounded fetal tissue, however, wounded tissue is replaced with normal tissue through the activity of stem cells.<ref name="Gurtner"/> A possible method for tissue regeneration in adults is to place adult stem cell "seeds" inside a tissue bed "soil" in a wound bed and allow the stem cells to stimulate differentiation in the tissue bed cells. This method elicits a regenerative response more similar to fetal wound-healing than adult scar tissue formation.<ref name=Gurtner>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.med.58.082405.095329 | author = Gurtner GC, Callaghan MJ, Longaker MT | year = 2007 | title = Progress and potential for regenerative medicine | url = | journal = Annu.

== Clinical trials ==
On January 23, 2009, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] gave clearance to [[Geron Corporation]] for the initiation of the first clinical trial of an embryonic stem cell-based therapy on humans. The trial aimed evaluate the drug GRNOPC1, [[embryonic stem cell]]-derived [[oligodendrocyte]] progenitor cells, on patients with acute [[spinal cord injury]]. The trial was discontinued in November 2011 so that the
company could focus on therapies in the "current environment of capital scarcity and uncertain economic conditions".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/innovation/2012/0127/1224310600371.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Claire | last=O'Connell | title=Stem cells - where are we now? | date=January 27, 2012}}</ref>

====Potential contributions to veterinary medicine====

:Research currently conducted on horses, dogs, and cats can benefit  the development of  stem-cell treatments in veterinary medicine and can target a wide range of injuries and diseases such as [[myocardial infarction]], [[stroke]], [[tendon]] and [[ligament]] damage, [[osteoarthritis]], [[osteochondrosis]] and [[muscular dystrophy]] both in large animals, as well as humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chen J, Li Y, Wang L, ''et al.'' |title=Therapeutic benefit of intravenous administration of bone marrow stromal cells after cerebral ischemia in rats |journal=Stroke |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=1005–11 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11283404 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11283404 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.32.4.1005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000043246.74879.CD |author=Assmus B, Schächinger V, Teupe C, ''et al.'' |title=Transplantation of Progenitor Cells and Regeneration Enhancement in Acute Myocardial Infarction (TOPCARE-AMI) |journal=Circulation |volume=106 |issue=24 |pages=3009–17 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12473544 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12473544}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Murphy JM, Fink DJ, Hunziker EB, Barry FP |title=Stem cell therapy in a caprine model of osteoarthritis |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=3464–74 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14673997 |doi=10.1002/art.11365}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sampaolesi M, Blot S, D'Antona G, ''et al.'' |title=Mesoangioblast stem cells ameliorate muscle function in dystrophic dogs |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7119 |pages=574–9 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17108972 |doi=10.1038/nature05282}}</ref> While investigation of cell-based therapeutics generally reflects human medical needs, the high degree of frequency and severity of certain injuries in [[racehorses]] has put veterinary medicine at the forefront of this novel regenerative approach.<ref name="taylor">{{cite journal |doi=10.2746/042516407X180868 |author=Taylor SE, Smith RK, Clegg PD |title=Mesenchymal stem cell therapy in equine musculoskeletal disease: scientific fact or clinical fiction? |journal=Equine Vet.

====Development of regenerative treatment models====
:Stem cells are thought to mediate repair via five primary mechanisms: 1) providing an anti-inflammatory effect, 2) homing to damaged tissues and recruiting other cells, such as [[endothelial progenitor cell]]s, that are necessary for tissue growth, 3) supporting tissue remodeling over scar formation, 4) inhibiting [[apoptosis]], and 5) differentiating into bone, cartilage, tendon, and ligament tissue.<ref name=Richardson07>{{cite journal |author=Richardson LE, Dudhia J, Clegg PD, Smith R |title=Stem cells in veterinary medicine—attempts at regenerating equine tendon after injury |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=409–16 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17692415 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2007.07.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167-7799(07)00188-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Csaki C, Matis U, Mobasheri A, Ye H, Shakibaei M |title=Chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and adipogenesis of canine mesenchymal stem cells: a biochemical, morphological and ultrastructural study |journal=Histochem.

:Stem cells have also been shown to have a low immunogenicity due to the relatively low number of MHC molecules found on their surface.

:Because of the general positive healing capabilities of stem cells, they have gained interest for the treatment of cutaneous wounds. This is important interest for those with reduced healing capabilities, like diabetics and those undergoing chemotherapy.  In one trial, stem cells were isolated from the Wharton’s jelly of the umbilical cord. These cells were injected directly into the wounds.

:Soft palate defects in horses are caused by a failure of the embryo to fully close at the midline during embryogenesis.  These are often not found until after they have become worse because of the difficulty in visualizing the entire soft palate. This lack of visualization is thought to also contribute to the low success rate in surgical intervention to repair the defect. As a result, the horse often has to be euthanized.  Recently, the use of mesenchymal stem cells has been added to the conventional treatments. After the surgeon has sutured the palate closed, autologous mesenchymal cells are injected into the soft palate. The stem cells were found to be integrated into the healing tissue especially along the border with the old tissue. There was also a large reduction in the number of inflammatory cells present, which is thought to aid in the healing process.<ref name="palate">{{cite journal |author=Carstanjen B, Desbois C, Hekmati M, Behr L |journal=The Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research |year=2006 |volume=70 | pages=143–147 |pmid=16639947 |pmc=1410720 |issue=2 |title=Successful engraftment of cultured autologous mesenchymal stem cells in a surgically repaired soft palate defect in an adult horse}}</ref>

====Stem cells and orthopedic repairs====
:Autologous stem cell-based treatments for [[ligament]] injury, [[tendon]] injury, [[osteoarthritis]], [[osteochondrosis]], and sub-chondral bone cysts have been commercially available to practicing veterinarians to treat horses since 2003 in the United States and since 2006 in the United Kingdom.  Autologous stem-cell based treatments for tendon injury, ligament injury, and [[osteoarthritis]] in dogs have been available to veterinarians in the United States since 2005.  Over 3000 privately owned horses and dogs have been treated with autologous adipose-derived stem cells.  The efficacy of these treatments has been shown in double-blind clinical trials for dogs with osteoarthritis of the hip and elbow and horses with tendon damage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Black LL, Gaynor J, Adams C, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of intraarticular injection of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem and regenerative cells on clinical signs of chronic osteoarthritis of the elbow joint in dogs |journal=Vet.

=====Tendon repair=====
:Race horses are especially prone to injuries of the tendon and ligaments. Conventional therapies are very unsuccessful in returning the horse to full functioning potential. Natural healing, guided by the conventional treatments, leads to the formation of fibrous scar tissue that reduces flexibility and full joint movement. Traditional treatments prevented a large number of horses from returning to full activity and also have a high incidence of re-injury due to the stiff nature of the scarred tendon.  Introduction of both bone marrow and adipose derived stem cells, along with natural mechanical stimulus promoted the regeneration of tendon tissue. The natural movement promoted the alignment of the new fibers and tendocytes with the natural alignment found in uninjured tendons. Stem-cell treatment not only allowed more horses to return to full duty and also greatly reduced the re-injury rate over a three-year period.<ref name=orthoa />

:More recently, the use of embryonic stem cells has also been applied to tendon repair.  The embryonic stem cells were shown to have a better survival rate in the tendon as well as better migrating capabilities to reach all areas of damaged tendon. The overall repair quality was also higher, with better tendon architecture and collagen formed.  There was also no tumor formation seen during the three month experimental period. Long term studies need to be carried out to examine the long term efficacy and risks associated with the use of embryonic stem cells.<ref name=orthoa /> Similar results have been found in small animals.<ref name=orthoa />

=====Joint repair=====
:Osteoarthritis is the main cause of joint pain both in animals and humans. Horses and dogs are most frequently affected arthritis. Natural cartilage regeneration is very limited and no current drug therapies are curative, but rather look to reduce the symptoms associated with the degeneration.  Different types of mesenchymal stem cells and other additives are still being researched to find the best type of cell and method for long term treatment.<ref name=orthoa />

:Adipose-derived mesenchymal cells are currently the most often used because of the non-invasive harvesting.  There has been a lot of success recently injecting mesenchymal stem cells directly into the joint. This is a recently developed, non-invasive technique developed for easier clinical use. Dogs receiving this treatment showed greater flexibility in their joints and less pain.<ref name="arth">{{cite journal |author=Annalisa Guercio et al. |journal=Cell Biology International |year=2012 |volume=36 |pages=189–194  |doi=10.1042/CBI20110304}}</ref>

=====Bone defect repair=====
:While further studies are necessary to fully characterize the use of cell-based therapeutics for treatment of bone fractures, s

:Bone has a unique and well documented natural healing process that normally is sufficient to repair fractures and other common injuries. Misaligned breaks due to severe trauma, as well as things like tumor resections of bone cancer, are prone to improper healing if left to the natural process alone. Scaffolds composed of natural and artificial components are seeded with mesenchymal stem cells and placed in the defect. Within four weeks of placing the scaffold, newly formed bone begins to integrate with the old bone and within 32 weeks, full union is achieved.<ref name=reviewz>{{cite journal |author=I Ribitsch et al. |journal=Advanced Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology |year=2010 |volume=123 |pages=219–263 |doi=10.1007/10_2010_66}}</ref> Further studies are necessary to fully characterize the use of cell-based therapeutics for treatment of bone fractures.

:Stem cells have also been used to treat degenerative bone diseases. The normally recommended treatment for dogs that have Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is to remove the head of the femur after the degeneration has progressed.  Recently, mesenchymal stem cells have been injected directly in to the head of the femur, with success not only in bone regeneration, but also in pain reduction.<ref name=reviewz />

====Stem cells and muscle repairs====
:Stem cells have successfully been used to ameliorate healing in the heart after myocardial infarction in dogs. Adipose and bone marrow derived stem cells were removed and induced to a cardiac cell fate before being injected into the heart.  The heart was found to have improved contractility and a reduction in the damaged area four weeks after the stem cells were applied.<ref name="hearta">{{cite journal |author=Ung Kim et al. |journal=International Journal of Cardiology |year=2011 |volume=146 |pages=371–378 |doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.07.016}}</ref>

:A different trial is underway for a patch made of a porous substance on to which the stem cells are "seeded" in order to induce tissue regeneration in heart defects.  Tissue was regenerated and the patch was well incorporated into the heart tissue. This is thought to be due, in part, to improved angiogenesis and reduction of inflammation. Although cardiomyocytes were produced from the mesenchymal stem cells, they did not appear to be contractile. Other treatments that induced a cardiac fate in the cells before transplanting had greater success at creating contractile heart tissue.<ref name="heartb">{{cite journal |author=Yen Chang et al. |journal=Surgery for Acquired Cardiovascular Disease |year=2007 |volume=134 |pages=65–73 |doi=10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.02.019}}</ref>

:Stem cells have been used recently to hasten the healing of skeletal muscle tears in working dogs. Traditional therapies rely on rest and anti-inflammatory treatments have been shown to permanently reduce the functioning in the muscle.  Adipose derived stem cells were injected directly into the tear of the semitendinosus muscle. Physical therapy was also completed during the healing process. Healing was observed much earlier than with traditional methods and the dogs were able to return to full work without any long term muscle damage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=S. Gary Brown, Robert J Harman, & Linda L Black |journal=Stem Cell Discovery |year=2012 |volume=2 |pages=41–44 |doi=10.4236/scd.2012.22007}}</ref>

====Stem cells and nervous system repairs====
:Spinal cord injuries are one of the most common traumas brought into veterinary hospitals.<ref name=reviewz /> Spinal injuries occur in two ways after the trauma: the primary mechanical damage, and in secondary processes, like inflammation and scar formation, in the days following the trauma. These cells involved in the secondary damage response secrete factors that promote scar formation and inhibit cellular regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells that are induced to a neural cell fate are loaded on to a porous scaffold and are then implanted at the site of injury. The cells and scaffold secrete factors that counteract those secreted by scar forming cells and promote neural regeneration.  Eight weeks later, dogs treated with stem cells showed immense improvement over those treated with conventional therapies. Dogs treated with stem cells were able to occasionally support their own weight, which has not been seen in dogs undergoing conventional therapies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sung Su Park et al. |journal=Cytotherapy |year=2012 |volume=14 |pages=584–597 |doi=10.319/14653249.2012.658913}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hak-Hyun Ryu et al.|journal=Journal of Veterinary Science |year=2009 |volume=10 |pages=273–284 |doi=10.4142/jvs.2009.10.4.273}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hidetaka Nishida et al. |journal=Veterinary Surgery |year=2012 |volume=00 |pages=1–6 |doi=10.111/j.1532-950X.2011.00959.x}}</ref>

:Treatments are also in clinical trials to repair and regenerate peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves are more likely to be damaged, but the effects of the damage are not as widespread as seen in injuries to the spinal cord. Treatments are currently in clinical trials to repair severed nerves, with early success. Stem cells induced to a neural fate injected in to a severed nerve.  Within four weeks, regeneration of previously damaged stem cells and completely formed nerve bundles were observed.<ref name=nerve />

:Stem cells are also in clinical phases for treatment in ophthalmology. Hematopoietic stem cells have been used to treat corneal ulcers of different origin of several horses. These ulcers were resistant to conventional treatments available, but quickly responded positively to the stem-cell treatment. Stem cells were also able to restore sight in one eye of a horse with retinal detachment, allowing the horse to return to daily activities.<ref name=eyes />

====Current areas of research====

=====Stems cells in the lab=====
:The ability to grow up functional adult tissues indefinitely in culture creates new opportunities for drug research. Researchers are able to grow up differentiated cell lines and then test new drugs on each cell type to examine possible interactions ''in vitro'' before performing ''in vivo'' studies. This is critical in the development of drugs for use in veterinary research because of the possibilities of species specific interactions.  The hope is that having these cell lines available for research use will reduce the need for research animals used because affects on human tissue ''in vitro'' will provide insight not normally known before the animal testing phase.<ref name=reviewa />

:With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), treatments being explored and created for the used in endangered low production animals possible. Rather than needing to harvest embryos or eggs, which are limited, the researchers can remove mesenchymal stem cells with greater ease and greatly reducing the danger to the animal due to noninvasive techniques. This allows the limited eggs to be put to use for reproductive purposes only.<ref name=reviewa />

=====Stem cells and conservation=====
:Stem cells are being explored for use in conservation efforts. Spermatogonial stem cells have been harvested from a rat and placed into a mouse host and fully mature sperm were produced with the ability to produce viable offspring. Currently research is underway to find suitable hosts for the introduction of donor spermatogonial stem cells. If this becomes a viable option for conservationists, sperm can be produced from high genetic quality individuals who die before reaching sexual maturity, preserving a line that would otherwise be lost.<ref>{{cite journal |author=I. Dobrinski and A.J. Travis |journal=Reproduction , Fertility, and Development |year=2007  |volume=19  |pages=732–739  |doi=10.10710RD07036}}</ref>

=====Future clinical uses=====
:The use of stem cells for the treatment of liver disease in both humans and animals has been the focus of considerable interest. The liver has some natural regenerative properties, but is often insufficient to deal with the extent of some liver diseases. Hepatocytes have been formed from some sources of MSC, but they have not been applied clinically currently.<ref name=reviewz /> There is a large effort to create stem cells differentiated along the pancreatic line as a possible cure for diabetes, but no line has been well established.<ref name=reviewz />

:Mesenchymal stem cells are currently under clinical trials as a possible treatment for graft v. host disease and graft rejection after experiments on various animals showing that allogenic stem-cell treatments were not rejected and showed no difference in healing capabilities compared with autologous stem cells. This is being further researched for creating off-the-shelf allogenic stem-cell treatments for various aspects in regenerative veterinary medicine.<ref name=orthoa /> Clinical trials are underway to explore the low immunogenic properties of stem cells and their possible use for treatment of problems with an overactive immune system seen with allergies and autoimmune disorders.<ref name=reviewa />

:In recent years, US based stem cell clinics have emerged that treat patients with their own bone marrow or adipose derived adult stem cells as part of clinical trials or FDA authorized same day outpatient IRB programs, most notably for athletes to recover from osteoskeletal (bone, joint and connective tissue) related injuries. This emergence of US based human adult stem-cell therapy is discussed by Dr. Rudderham in his 2012 article [http://www.onlinewellnesscommunity.com/blog/2012/07/stem-cell-therapy/ Adult Stem Cell US Therapy].<ref>[http://www.onlinewellnesscommunity.com Health, Wellness, Nutrition and Anti-Aging Integrative Medicine Experts & Information - Superior Raw Super Food Supplements - Online Wellness Community<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

:The long term impact of these treatments will need to be examined outside of their contribution to medicine.<ref name=orthoa /> Vast improvements in veterinary medicine has allowed for companion and farm animals to live longer lives. This, however, has contributed to the rise in injury and chronic illness in companion animals.<ref name=reviewa /> Stem-cell treatments, especially for the treatment of orthopedic issues in horses, allows for working animals to return to a normal state of activity at a faster rate with a reduction in the re-injury rate.<ref name=orthoa />

==Embryonic stem cell controversy==
{{Main|Stem cell controversy}}
There is widespread controversy over the use of human [[embryonic stem cell]]s. This controversy primarily targets the techniques used to derive new embryonic [[stem cell line]]s, which often requires the destruction of the [[blastocyst]]. Opposition to the use of human embryonic stem cells in research is often based on philosophical, moral or religious objections.<ref name="Mlsna">

==Stem-cell treatments around the world==

===China===

Stem cell research and treatment is currently being practiced  at a clinical level in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China]] has permitted the use of stem-cell therapy for conditions beyond those approved of in Western countries such as the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Australia]].  The Western World has scrutinized China for its failed attempts to meet international documentation standards of these trials and procedures.<ref name="PMID 16467274">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1545968305284675 | pmid = 16467274 | volume=20 | issue=1 | title=Cellular transplants in China: observational study from the largest human experiment in chronic spinal cord injury | year=2006 | month=March | author=Dobkin BH, Curt A, Guest J | journal=Neurorehabil Neural Repair | pages=5–13}}</ref>

Stem-cell therapies provided in China utilize a variety of cell types including umbilical cord stem cells and olfactory ensheathing cells. The stem cells are then expanded in centralized blood banks before being used in stem-cell treatments. State-funded companies based in the [[Shenzhen]] Hi-Tech Industrial Zone treat the symptoms of numerous disorders with adult stem-cell therapy. Hospitals throughout eastern China provide numerous therapies to patients in coordination with the stem cell providers. These companies' therapies are currently focused on the treatment of [[neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] and [[cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular]] disorders. The most radical successes of Chinese adult stem-cell therapy have been in treating the brain. These therapies administer stem cells directly to the brain to promote greater motor and brain function in patients with Cerebral Palsy, Alzheimer's, and brain injuries. However, retrospective studies have shown that Chinese use of fetal-derived brain tissue in spinal cord injured human subjects were not as promising as once thought: the phenotype and the fate of the transplanted cells, described as olfactory ensheathing cells, were unknown. As well, perioperative morbidity and lack of functional benefit were identified as the most serious clinical shortcomings.<ref name="PMID 16467274"/>  Furthermore, the extent of regulatory policy in the use of stem-cell therapies in China is unclear.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/459146a | pmid = 19444176 | volume=459 | issue=7244 | title=Stem-cell therapy faces more scrutiny in China | year=2009 | month=May | author=Cyranoski D | journal=Nature | pages=146–7}}</ref> In the absence of a valid clinical trials protocol, and more regulatory oversight, Western regulatory agencies advise patients and physicians to be cautious when selecting Chinese stem-cell therapeutic centers.<ref name="PMID 16467274"/>

===Mexico===

Stem-cell treatment is currently being practiced at a clinical level in Mexico. An International Health Department Permit (COFEPRIS) is required. Currently only three centers have this authorization. These centers are found in Tijuana, Guadalajara and Cancun. Currently undergoing the approval process is Los Cabos. This permit allows the use of stem-cell types beyond those approved of in Western countries such as the United States, Asia or Europe. Stem-cell therapies provided in Mexico utilize patient Adipose, Bone Marrow, or Blood. All sources must be autologous, from the patients own body.

===Middle East and North Africa===

In 2006 the [[American University in Beirut]] [[Lebanon]], started the very first application on therapeutic use of stem cells, later on many centers and doctors imported a diversity of techniques and by 2008 at least four centers were doing stem cell application: The American University Hospital,<ref>[http://www.labome.org/expert/lebanon/saint/yamout/bassem-i-yamout-1171557.html Bassem I Yamout<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=537024 American University of Beirut scientists testing stem cell therapy – SkyscraperCity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Bahman Hospital,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Saint Georges Ajaltoun Hospital<ref>[http://cell4life.com/ Stem Cell Therapy Center, Lebanon]</ref> and Al Rahma Tripoli Hospital{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}{{spaced ndash}}this latest by a German team.

Proliferative and non-proliferative, in-vivo and in-vitro techniques were used. Additional hospitals doing stem-cell manipulation include: Hospital of Our Lady Jounieh,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Levant Hospital (Al Mashrik),{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Middle East Institute of Health (Al Sharq-el-Awsat) at '''Reviva''' The Regenerative Medicine Center<ref>http://www.meih.org/DepartmentSubCat.asp?subcatid=186</ref> for Stem cell Therapy, Storage and Esthetic use, in collaboration with The Lebanese University <ref>http://www.ul.edu.lb/lu/default.aspx</ref> Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Medical Sciences.

In Amman Jordan the very first application were in 2008 on neurological diseases<ref>[http://sci.rutgers.edu/forum/showthread.php?t=129373 interesting news about stem cell success by a Jordanian team – CareCure Forums]</ref> and erectile dysfunctions.

In [[Cairo]] [[Egypt]], Stem cell application for liver [[cirrhosis]] were thriving in 2011.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Egypt is an epidemic area for [[Hepatitis C]] and subsequent Hepatic cirrhosis.

===South Korea===

In 2005, [[South Korean]] scientists claimed to have generated stem cells that were tailored to match the recipient.
Each of the 11 new stem cell lines was developed using [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] (SCNT) technology. The resultant cells were thought to match the genetic material of the recipient, thus suggesting minimal to no cell rejection.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4555023.stm | work=BBC News | title=Stem cells tailored to patients | date=May 20, 2005 | accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref>

This study, however, was eventually discredited as the primary researcher, Dr. [[Woo Suk Hwang]], admitted to using cells obtained from his research staff.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} In Dec 2005, claims were put forward that his research had been manipulated to wrongfully indicate positive results. Later that month, these claims were confirmed by an academic panel.<ref>Hwang's Stem Cell Claims Further Discredited, http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2005/12/29-01.html</ref>

In 2013, a two-year-old girl in Seoul Hospital born without a windpipe was saved with a new windpipe grown from stem cells extracted from her bone marrow.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Stem-cells-grow-toddler-a-new-windpipe/tabid/1160/articleID/296259/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Stem cells grow a new windpipe| date=May 2, 2013}}</ref>

===Thailand===

As of 2013, Thailand still considers adipose autologous stem cell transplant as experimental.  Dr. Richard DeAndrea will be assisting Dr. Kampon with a clinical trial in October 2013 with 20 patients.  10 are going to receive stem cell therapy for Type-2 Diabetes and the other 10 will receive stem cell therapy for emphysema.  Dr [[Richard DeAndrea]], MD, ND, presented at the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M) Conference, [[Thailand]].[<ref>DeAndrea, R. (2011), , Ltd., "A Holistic Approach: Anti-Aging Treatment with Patient-Derived Fat Stem Cells", [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M) Conference, Thailand</ref>]

===Ukraine===

Today, [[Ukraine]] is permitted to perform clinical trials of stem-cell treatments (Order of the MH of Ukraine № 630 "About carrying out clinical trials of stem cells", 2008) for the treatment of these pathologies: pancreatic necrosis, cirrhosis, hepatitis, burn disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, critical lower limb ischemia. The first medical institution granted the right to conduct clinical trials became the "Institute of Cell Therapy"(Kiev).
