'''SLUDGE'''  is a mnemonic for the pathological effects indicative of massive discharge of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]].  Unlikely to occur naturally, SLUDGE is usually encountered only in cases of drug overdose, ingestion of certain [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] [[mushroom]]s (particularly the [[muscarine]]-containing members of the genera ''[[Inocybe]]'' and ''[[Clitocybe]]''), or exposure to [[nerve agent|nerve gases]].  Nerve gases irreversibly inhibit the enzyme [[Cholinesterase|acetylcholinesterase]]; this results in a chronically high level of [[acetylcholine]] at cholinergic [[synapses]] throughout the body, thus chronically stimulating acetylcholine receptors throughout the body.  The symptoms of "SLUDGE" are due to chronic stimulation of [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptors]], in organs and muscles innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system.  It is useful to remember some of the [[symptoms]] of increased [[cholinergic]] stimulation through the [[mnemonic]] '''SLUDGE''':

* [[Salivation]]:     stimulation of the [[salivary glands]] 
* [[Lacrimation]]:    stimulation of the [[lacrimal glands]]
* [[Urination]]:      relaxation of the [[internal sphincter muscle of urethra]], and contraction of the [[Detrusor urinae muscle|detrusor muscles]]
* [[Defecation]]:     relaxation of the [[internal anal sphincter]]
* [[Nausea|Gastrointestinal upset]]:     [[Smooth muscle]] tone changes causing [[gastrointestinal]] problems, including [[diarrhea]]
* [[Emesis]]:         Vomiting

An extension is '''SLUDGEM''', where the additional M indicates:
*[[Miosis]]:     stimulation of the [[Iris sphincter muscle|pupillary constrictor muscles]]
or
*[[Muscle spasm]]:     stimulation of [[skeletal muscle]]

Another mnemonic is '''DUMBBELSS''' which stands for diarrhea, urination, miosis/muscle weakness, [[bronchorrhea]], [[bradycardia]], emesis, lacrimation, salivation/sweating.

One common cause of SLUDGE is exposure to [[organophosphates|organophosphorus insecticides]] (including [[parathion]], [[malathion]], and [[diazinon]]) or [[nerve gas]], such as [[sarin]]. These agents [[phosphorylate]] acetylcholinesterase, thereby irreversibly deactivating acetylcholinesterase and raising acetylcholine levels and causing SLUDGE(M).

SLUDGE may be treated with [[atropine]], [[pralidoxime]] or other anticholinergics.
