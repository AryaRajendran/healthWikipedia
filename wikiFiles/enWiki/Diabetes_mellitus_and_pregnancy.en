For women with '''[[diabetes mellitus]], [[pregnancy]]''' can present some particular challenges for both mother and child. If the woman who is pregnant has diabetes, it can cause early, and very large babies.

Planning in advance is emphasized if one wants to have a baby and has [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]] or [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]]. Pregnancy management for diabetics needs stringent blood glucose control even in advance of having [[pregnancy]].

==Physiology==
During a normal pregnancy, many physiological changes occur such as increased hormonal secretions that influence [[blood]] [[glucose]] levels, such as a glucose-'drain' to the [[fetus]], slowed emptying of the [[stomach]], increased excretion of glucose by the [[kidney]]s and resistance of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s to [[insulin]].

==Risks for the child==
The risks of maternal diabetes to the developing fetus include [[Miscarriage]], growth restriction, growth acceleration, fetal obesity ([[macrosomia]]), mild neurological deficits.,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ornoy A, Wolf A, Ratzon N, Greenbaum C, Dulitzky M |title=Neurodevelopmental outcome at early school age of children born to mothers with gestational diabetes |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood.

Mild neurological and cognitive deficits in offspring, including increased symptoms of [[ADHD]], impaired fine and gross motor skills, and impaired explicit memory performance, have been linked to pregestational Type I diabetes and gestational diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nomura Y, Marks DJ, Grossman B, Yoon M, Loudon H, Stone J, Halperin JM |title=Exposure to Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Low Socioeconomic Status: Effects on Neurocognitive Development and Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Offspring |journal=Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2012 |month=January |pmid=22213602 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.784 |url=}}	</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ornoy A, Ratzon N, Greenbaum C, Wolf A, Dulitzky M |title=School-age children born to diabetic mothers and to mothers with gestational diabetes exhibit a high rate of inattention and fine and gross motor impairment |journal=Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism : JPEM |volume=14 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=681–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11393563 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=DeBoer T, Wewerka S, Bauer PJ, Georgieff MK, Nelson CA |title=Explicit memory performance in infants of diabetic mothers at 1 year of age |journal=Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology |volume=47 |issue=8 |pages=525–31 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16108452 |pmc=2829746 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Prenatal iron deficiency has been suggested as a possible mechanism for these problems.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Georgieff MK |title=The effect of maternal diabetes during pregnancy on the neurodevelopment of offspring |journal=Minnesota Medicine |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=44–7 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16669433 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Birth defects are not currently an identified risk for the child of women with [[gestational diabetes]], since those primarily occur in the latter part of pregnancy, where vital organs already have taken their most essential shape.

Still, having [[diabetes type I]] or [[diabetes type II|II]] has a 2-3 <ref name=gareskog>[http://publications.uu.se/theses/spikblad.xsql?dbid=7203 Author: Gäreskog, Mattias Title: Teratogenicity Involved in Experimental Diabetic Pregnancy]</ref> fold increase in risk of birth defects. The cause is e.g. [[oxidative stress]], by activating [[protein kinase C]]<ref name=gareskog/> and lead to [[apoptosis]] of some cells.<ref name=gareskog/>

==Importance of blood glucose level during pregnancy==
[[High blood sugar]] is harmful to both the mother and her fetus. Experts advise diabetics to maintain the [[blood sugar level]] close to normal range for 2 to 3 months in advance, before planning for pregnancy. Managing blood sugar close to normal before and during pregnancy helps to protect the health of both mother and the baby.

[[Insulin]] may be needed for type 2 diabetics instead of [[diabetes medication]] (oral) or extra insulin may be needed for type 1 diabetics during pregnancy. Doctors' may advise to check blood sugar more often to maintain near normal blood sugar level.

==Tips for diabetics before and during pregnancy==
* Coordinate with the health care team to achieve blood sugar level close to the normal range.
* Consult with a doctor, who has experience in handling diabetes mellitus during pregnancy.
* Put some extra care to the eyes and kidneys and check it frequently, because pregnancy may make it worse.
* Stop smoking, drinking alcohol, or use of harmful drugs.
* Consult and coordinate with an experienced dietician and plan your meal and follow it strictly and make sure the mother and the unborn baby have a healthy diet.

If already pregnant, then consult the doctor right away. It’s not too late to bring the blood sugar close to normal so that the mother and the baby stay healthy during the rest of the pregnancy.

==Diabetes pregnancy management==
Diabetes mellitus may be effectively managed by appropriate meal planning, increased physical activity and properly-instituted insulin treatment.  Some tips for controlling diabetes in pregnancy include:

* Meals – cut down sweets, eats three small meals and one to three snacks a day, maintain proper mealtimes, and include balanced fiber intake in the form of fruits, vegetables and whole-grains.
* Increased physical activity - walking, swimming/aquaerobics, etc.
* Monitor blood sugar level frequently, doctors may ask to check the blood glucose more often than usual.
* The blood sugar level should be below 95&nbsp;mg/dl (5.3&nbsp;mmol/l) on awakening, below 140&nbsp;mg/dl (7.8&nbsp;mmol/l) one hour after a meal and below 120&nbsp;mg/dl (6.7&nbsp;mmol/l) two hours after a meal.
* Each time when checking the blood sugar level, keep a proper record of the results and present to the health care team for evaluation and modification of the treatment. If blood sugar levels are above targets, a perinatal diabetes management team may suggest ways to achieve targets.
* Many may need extra insulin during pregnancy to reach their blood sugar target. Insulin is not harmful for the baby.

==Breast feeding==
[[Breast feeding]] is good for the child even with a mother with diabetes mellitus. Some women wonder whether breast feeding is recommended after they have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Breast feeding is recommended for most babies, including when mothers may be diabetic.  In fact, the child’s risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life may be lower if the baby was breast-fed.  It also helps the child to maintain a healthy body weight in infancy. However, the [[breastmilk]] of mothers with diabetes has been demonstrated to have a different composition than that of non-diabetic mothers, containing elevated levels of glucose and insulin and decreased [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]].<ref name=Rodekamp>{{cite journal |author=Rodekamp E, Harder T, Kohlhoff R, Dudenhausen JW, Plagemann A |title=Impact of breast-feeding on psychomotor and neuropsychological development in children of diabetic mothers: role of the late neonatal period |journal=Journal of Perinatal Medicine |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=490–6 |year=2006 |pmid=17140300 |doi=10.1515/JPM.2006.095 |url=}}</ref> Although benefits of breast-feeding for the children of diabetic mothers have been documented, ingestion of diabetic breast milk has also been linked to delayed language development on a dose-dependent basis.<ref name=Rodekamp/>

==Classification==
The White classification, named after [[Priscilla White (physician)|Priscilla White]]<ref name="PWhite">{{cite journal | pmid = 15396063 | volume=7 | issue=5 | title=Pregnancy complicating diabetes | year=1949 | month=November | author=White P | journal=Am. J. Med. | pages=609–16 | doi=10.1016/0002-9343(49)90382-4}}</ref> who pioneered research on the effect of diabetes types on perinatal outcome, is widely used to assess maternal and fetal risk. It distinguishes between gestational diabetes (type A) and diabetes that existed before pregnancy (pregestational diabetes). These two groups are further subdivided according to their associated risks and management.<ref name="OBSTETRICS">Gabbe S.G., Niebyl J.R., Simpson J.L. OBSTETRICS: Normal and Problem Pregnancies. Fourth edition. Churchill Livingstone, New York, 2002. ISBN 0-443-06572-1</ref>

There are 2 classes of gestational diabetes (diabetes which began during pregnancy): 
* Class A<sub>1</sub>: gestational diabetes; diet controlled
* Class A<sub>2</sub>: gestational diabetes; medication controlled

The second group of diabetes which existed before pregnancy can be split up into these classes:
* Class B: onset at age 20 or older or with duration of less than 10 years
* Class C: onset at age 10-19 or duration of 10–19 years
* Class D: onset before age 10 or duration greater than 20 years
* Class E: overt diabetes mellitus with calcified pelvic vessels
* Class F: [[diabetic nephropathy]]
* Class R: proliferative [[retinopathy]]
* Class RF: [[retinopathy]] and [[nephropathy]]
* Class H: [[ischemic heart disease]]
* Class T: prior kidney transplant
An early age of onset or long-standing disease comes with greater risks, hence the first three subtypes.

==Treatment of pregnant women with diabetes==
Blood glucose levels in the pregnant woman should be regulated as strictly as possible. In [[diabetes mellitus type 2]], oral [[antidiabetic drug]]s should be replaced with [[insulin]].
