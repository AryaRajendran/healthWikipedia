'''Shoulder dystocia''' is a specific case of [[dystocia]] whereby after the delivery of the head, the anterior [[shoulder]] of the [[infant]] cannot pass below the [[pubic symphysis]], or requires significant manipulation to pass below the [[pubic symphysis]]. It is diagnosed when the shoulders fail to deliver shortly after the fetal head. In shoulder dystocia, it is the chin that presses against the walls of the [[perineum]]. Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency, and fetal demise can occur if the infant is not delivered, due to compression of the [[umbilical cord]] within the birth canal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kish |first1=Karen |first2=Joseph V. |last2=Collea |editor1-first=Alan H. |editor1-last=DeCherney |others= Lauren Nathan |title= Current Obstetric & Gynecologic Diagnosis & Treatment |edition=9th |year= 2003 |publisher= Lange/McGraw-Hill |isbn= 0-07-118207-1|pages= 381–2 |chapter=Ch. 21: Malpresentation & Cord Prolapse |ref=harv}}</ref>

==Signs==
One often described feature is the '''turtle sign''', which involves the appearance and retraction of the fetal head (analogous to a turtle withdrawing into its shell), and the [[erythematous]] (red), puffy face indicative of facial flushing. This occurs when the baby's shoulder is obstructed by the maternal [[pelvis]].<ref name="Foetal injuries">{{cite web |url=http://www.shoulderdystociainfo.com/resolvedwithoutfetal.htm |title=Can shoulder dystocia be resolved without fetal injury when it does occur? |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=}}</ref>

==Procedures==
A number of labor positions and/or obstetrical maneuvers are sequentially performed in attempt to facilitate delivery at this point, including :

* [[McRoberts maneuver]];<ref name="pmid12962353">{{cite journal |author=Stallard TC, Burns B |title=Emergency delivery and perimortem C-section |journal=Emerg. Med. Clin. North Am. |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=679–93 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12962353 |doi=10.1016/S0733-8627(03)00042-7}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kish|Collea|2003|p=382}}</ref>  The McRoberts maneuver is employed in case of shoulder dystocia during childbirth and involves hyperflexing the mother's legs tightly to her abdomen. This widens the pelvis, and flattens the spine in the lower back (lumbar spine). If this maneuver does not succeed, an assistant applies pressure on the lower abdomen (suprapubic pressure), and the delivered head is also gently pulled. The technique is effective in about 42% of cases
  
* suprapubic pressure (or Rubin I)<ref name="titleShoulder Dystocia Management">{{cite web |url=http://www.fpnotebook.com/OB108.htm |title=Shoulder Dystocia Management |accessdate=2007-11-28 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071008231525/http://www.fpnotebook.com/OB108.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-08}}</ref>

* Rubin II or posterior pressure on the [[anterior shoulder]], which would bring the fetus in an oblique position with head somewhat towards the vagina<ref name="titleShoulder Dystocia - April 1, 2004 - American Family Physician">{{cite journal |author=Baxley EG, Gobbo RW |title=Shoulder dystocia |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=69 |issue=7 |pages=1707–14 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15086043 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=15086043}}</ref>

* [[Woods' screw maneuver]] which leads to turning the anterior shoulder to the posterior and vice versa (somewhat the opposite of  Rubin II maneuver)<ref name="titleFetal Dystocia: Abnormalities and Complications of Labor and Delivery: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec18/ch264/ch264h.html |title=Fetal Dystocia: Abnormalities and Complications of Labor and Delivery: Merck Manual Professional |accessdate=2007-11-28 |work=}}</ref>

* [[Jacquemier's maneuver]] (also called Barnum's maneuver), or delivery of the [[posterior shoulder]] first, in which the forearm and hand are identified in the birth canal, and gently pulled.

*Gaskin maneuver, named after Certified Professional [[Midwife]], [[Ina May Gaskin]], involves moving the mother to an all fours position with the back arched, widening the pelvic outlet.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Murray, Michelle; Huelsmann, Gayle | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Labor and Delivery Nursing: Guide to Evidence-Based Practice | date= | publisher=Springer Publishing Company | location= | isbn=0-8261-1803-8 | pages=143–144}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=q22jEEZo7rwC&printsec=frontcover#PPA144,M1 |title=Labor and Delivery Nursing |accessdate=2009-02-01 |work=Labor and Delivery Nursing: A Guide to Evidence-Based Practice |publisher=Springer Publishing |date=2008-12-15 |isbn=978-0-8261-1803-5 |author1=Murray, Michelle |author2=Huelsmann, Gayle }}</ref>

More drastic maneuvers include 
* [[Zavanelli's maneuver]], which involves pushing the fetal head back in with performing a [[cesarean section]].<ref name="pmid2380511">{{cite journal |author=Fernandez H, Papiernik E |title=Manoeuvre de Zavanelli : application à la rétention de tête dernière au détroit supérieur : à propos d'une observation |trans_title=The Zavanelli maneuver: use during breech retention of the head in the birth canal.

* intentional fetal [[clavicular fracture]], which reduces the diameter of the shoulder girdle that requires to pass through the birth canal.

* maternal [[symphysiotomy]], which makes the opening of the birth canal laxer by breaking the  connective tissue between the two [[Pubis (bone)|pubes]] bones facilitating the passage of the shoulders.

* abdominal rescue, described by O'Shaughnessy, where a [[hysterotomy]] facilitates vaginal delivery of the impacted shoulder<ref name="pmid9764668">{{cite journal |author=O'Shaughnessy MJ |title=Hysterotomy facilitation of the vaginal delivery of the posterior arm in a case of severe shoulder dystocia |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=92 |issue=4 Pt 2 |pages=693–5 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9764668 |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(98)00153-7}}</ref>

==Management==
{{redirect|ALARMER|an animal who sounds an alarm|Alarmer}}
Management of shoulder dystocia has become a focus point for many obstetrical nursing units in North America.  Courses such as the Canadian [http://www.moreob.com More-OB program]  encourage nursing units to do routine drills to prevent delays in delivery which adversely affect both mother and fetus.  A common treatment mnemonic is ALARMER
*'''A'''sk for help.  This involves requesting the help of an obstetrician, anesthesia and pediatrics for subsequent resuscitation of the infant.
*'''L'''eg hyperflexion (McRoberts' maneuver)
*'''A'''nterior shoulder disimpaction ( pressure)
*'''R'''ubin maneuver
*'''M'''anual delivery of posterior arm
*'''E'''pisiotomy
*'''R'''oll over on all fours

The advantage of proceeding in the order of ALARMER is that it goes from least to most invasive, thereby reducing harm to the mother in the event that the infant delivers with one of the earlier maneuvers. In the event that these maneuvers are unsuccessful, a skilled obstetrician may attempt some of the additional procedures listed above.  Intentional clavicular fracture is a final attempt at nonoperative vaginal delivery prior to Zavanelli's maneuver or [[symphysiotomy]], both of which are considered extraordinary treatment measures.

==Risk factors==
Although the definition is imprecise, it occurs in approximately 1% of vaginal births. There are well-recognised risk factors, such as [[diabetes]],<ref name="pmid10676041">{{cite journal |author=Jouatte F, Aitken B, Dufour P, ''et al.'' |title=Diabète antérieur à la grossesse, à propos de 143 observations |trans_title=Diabetes before pregnancy, apropos of 143 cases |language=French |journal=Contracept Fertil Sex |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=845–52 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=10676041}}</ref> [[fetal macrosomia]], and [[maternal obesity]], but it is often difficult to predict.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Breeze AC, Lees CC |title=Managing shoulder dystocia |journal=Lancet |volume=364 |issue=9452 |pages=2160–1 |year=2004 |pmid=15610787 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17607-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Murray|coauthors= McKinney|title= Foundations of Maternal-Newborn and Women's Health Nursing|accessdate= 2010-10-25|edition= Fifth|year= 2006|month= |publisher= Saunders Elsevier|isbn= 978-1-4377-0259-0|page= 697|chapter= Intrapartum Complications Chapter 27)}}</ref> Despite appropriate obstetric management, fetal injury (such as brachial plexus injury) or even fetal death can be a complication of this obstetric emergency.

Recurrence rates are relatively high.<ref name="pmid17531900">{{cite journal |author=Gurewitsch ED, Johnson TL, Allen RH |title=After shoulder dystocia: managing the subsequent pregnancy and delivery |journal=Semin. Perinatol. |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=185–95 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17531900 |doi=10.1053/j.semperi.2007.03.009}}</ref>

==Complications==
The major concern of shoulder dystocia is [[Brachial plexus injury|damage]] to the upper [[brachial plexus]] nerves. These supply the sensory and motor components of the shoulder, arm and hands.<ref name="Foetal injuries">{{cite web |url=http://www.shoulderdystociainfo.com/fetalinjuries.htm |title=Fetal injuries following shoulder dystocia |accessdate=2008-11-19 |work=}}</ref> The [[etiology (medicine)|aetiology]] of injury to the fetus is debated, but a probable mechanism is manual stretching of the nerves, which in itself can cause injury. Furthermore, excess tension may physically tear the nerve roots out from the neonatal spinal column, resulting in total dysfunction. The ventral roots (motor pathway) are most prone to injury, as they are in the plane of greatest tension (anterior, sensory nerves are somewhat protected due to the usual inward movement of the shoulder).
