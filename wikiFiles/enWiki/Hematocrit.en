The '''hematocrit''' ('''Ht''' or '''HCT''', British spelling '''haematocrit'''), also known as '''packed cell volume''' ('''PCV''') or '''erythrocyte volume fraction''' (EVF), is the volume percentage (%) of red blood cells in [[blood]]. It is normally about 45% for men and 40% for women.<ref>{{cite book |author=Purves, William K. |coauthors=David Sadava, Gordon H. Orians, H. Craig Heller|title=Life: The Science of Biology |edition=7th|publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2004 |pages=954 |isbn=0-7167-9856-5 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> It is considered an integral part of a person's [[complete blood count]] results, along with [[hemoglobin]] concentration, [[white blood cell]] count, and [[platelet]] count. 

In [[mammal]]s, hematocrit is independent of body size.

==Etymology==
The term ''hematocrit'' (Greek  αιματοκριτης) comes from the Greek words hema (Greek αιμα, meaning "blood") and criterion (Greek κριτηριον){{clarify|meaning what?|date=May 2012}}. It was coined by [[Magnus Blix]] at Uppsala in 1891 as ''haematokrit''.<ref>SG Hedin in Skandanavia Arch.f Physiolgie 2:134-140,1891 "The Haematokrit: a New Apparatus for the Investigation of Blood."</ref> <ref>Medicine and the Reign of Technology, Stanley Joel Reiser, Cambridge University Press, Feb 27, 1981, p. 133</ref> The word ''haematokrit'' was modeled after ''lactokrit'' which was used in dairy farming. (See also: Scudder & Self in NEJM Oct 30, 1941 225:18 p.&nbsp;679 "Controlled Administration of Fluid in Surgery").

==Measurement methods==
[[Image:Packed cell volume diagram.svg|left|thumb|Packed cell volume diagram]]

The packed cell volume (PCV) can be determined by [[centrifuge|centrifuging]] [[heparin]]ized blood in a [[capillary tube]] (also known as a microhematocrit tube) at 10,000&nbsp;[[RPM]] for five minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Fi-La/Hematocrit.html |title= Hematocrit |work= Encyclopedia of Surgery: A Guide for Patients and Caregivers }}</ref> This separates the blood into layers. The volume of packed [[red blood cell]]s divided by the total volume of the blood sample gives the PCV. Because a tube is used, this can be calculated by measuring the lengths of the layers.

With modern lab equipment, the hematocrit is calculated by an [[automated analyzer]] and not directly measured. It is determined by multiplying the red cell count by the [[Mean corpuscular volume|mean cell volume]]. The hematocrit is slightly more accurate as the PCV includes small amounts of [[blood plasma]] trapped between the red cells. An estimated hematocrit as a percentage may be derived by tripling the [[hemoglobin]] concentration in [[gram|g]]/[[decilitre|dL]] and dropping the units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorslounge.com/hematology/labs/hematocrit.htm|title= Hematocrit (HCT) or Packed Cell Volume (PCV)}}</ref> The hemoglobin concentration is the measure used by [[blood bank]]s assess the level of iron in the donor's blood.

There have been cases in which the blood for testing was inadvertently drawn [[proximal]] to an intravenous line that was infusing packed red cells or fluids. In these situations, the hemoglobin level in the blood sample will not be the true level for the patient because the sample would contain a large amount of the infused material rather than what is diluted into the circulating whole blood.  That is, if packed red cells are being supplied, the sample will contain a large amount of those cells and the hematocrit will be artificially very high. On the converse, if saline or other fluids are being supplied, the blood sample would be diluted and the hematocrit will be artificially low.

==Elevated==
In cases of [[dengue fever]], a high hematocrit is a danger sign of an increased risk of [[dengue shock syndrome]].

[[Polycythemia vera]] (PV), a [[myeloproliferative disorder]] in which the bone marrow produces excessive numbers of red cells, is associated with elevated hematocrit. 

[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) and other pulmonary conditions associated with [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] may elicit an increased production of red blood cells.  This increase is mediated by the increased levels of [[erythropoietin]] by the kidneys in response to hypoxia.

Professional athletes' hematocrit levels are measured as part of tests for [[blood doping]] or [[erythropoietin]] (EPO) use; the level of hematocrit in a blood sample is compared with the long-term level for that athlete (to allow for individual variations in hematocrit level), and against an absolute permitted maximum (which is  based on maximum expected levels within the population, and the hematocrit level that causes increased risk of blood clots resulting in strokes or heart attacks).

Anabolic androgenic [[steroid]] (AAS) use can also increase the amount of RBCs and, therefore, impact the hematocrit, in particular the compounds [[boldenone]] and [[oxymetholone]]. 

If a patient is [[dehydrated]], the hematocrit may be elevated.

[[Capillary leak syndrome]] also leads to abnormally high hematocrit counts, because of the episodic leakage of plasma out of the circulatory system.

==Lowered==
Lowered hematocrit can simply signify [[hemorrhage]].

The [[mean corpuscular volume]] (MCV) and the [[Red blood cell distribution width|red cell distribution width]] (RDW) can be quite helpful in evaluating a lower-than-normal hematocrit, because it can help the clinician determine whether blood loss is chronic or acute. The MCV is the size of the red cells and the RDW is a relative measure of the variation in size of the red cell population. A low hematocrit with a low MCV with a high RDW suggests a chronic iron-deficient [[erythropoiesis]], but a normal RDW suggests a blood loss that is more acute, such as a hemorrhage. One unit of packed red blood cells will elevate the hematocrit by about 3%.

Groups of individuals at risk for developing anemia include: 

* infants without adequate iron intake
* children going through a rapid growth spurt, during which the iron available cannot keep up with the demands for a growing red cell mass
* women in childbearing years with an greater need for iron because of blood loss during menstruation
* pregnant women, in whom the growing fetus creates a high demand for iron
* patients with [[chronic kidney disease]], as their kidneys no longer secrete sufficient levels of the hormone [[erythropoietin]], which stimulates red blood cell production by the bone marrow
