'''Paracentesis''' is a form of [[body fluid sampling]] procedure, generally referring to '''peritoneocentesis''' (also called '''laparocentesis''' - "cent" means "pierce") in which the [[peritoneal cavity]] is punctured by a needle to sample [[peritoneal fluid]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/80944-overview Paracentesis] at Medscape.

==Indications==
It is used for a number of reasons:
* to relieve abdominal pressure from [[ascites]]
* to diagnose [[spontaneous bacterial peritonitis]] and other infections (e.g. abdominal TB)
* to diagnose [[metastatic]] [[cancer]]
* to diagnose [[blood]] in [[peritoneal]] space in trauma
* to puncture the [[Tympanites|tympanic]] membrane for diagnostic purposes, such as taking a bacterial swab from the middle ear (tympanocentesis).
* to reduce intra-ocular pressure in central retinal artery occlusion (oculocaentesi) and any hyphaema in the anterior chamber of the eye where blood does not get absorbed in a weeks time.

==Paracentesis for Ascites==

The procedure is often performed in a doctor's office or an outpatient clinic. In an expert's hands it is usually very safe, although there is a small risk of infection, excessive bleeding or perforating a loop of bowel. These last two risks can be minimized greatly with the use of ultrasound guidance.

The patient is requested to urinate before the procedure; alternately, a [[Foley catheter]] is used to empty the bladder. The patient is positioned in the bed with the head elevated at 45-60 degrees to allow fluid to accumulate in lower abdomen. After cleaning the side of the abdomen with an antiseptic solution, the physician numbs a small area of skin and inserts a large-bore needle with a plastic sheath 2 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) in length to reach the peritoneal (ascitic) fluid. The needle is removed, leaving the plastic sheath to allow drainage of the fluid. The fluid is drained by gravity, a syringe or by connection to a vacuum bottle. Several litres of fluid may be drained during the procedure; however, if more than two litres are to be drained it will usually be done over the course of several treatments. If fluid drainage is more than 5 litres, patients may receive [[intravenous]] [[serum albumin]] (25% albumin, 8g/L) to prevent [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure). After the desired level of drainage is complete, the plastic sheath is removed and the puncture site bandaged. The plastic sheath can be left in place with a flow control valve and protective dressing if further treatments are expected to be necessary.

The procedure generally is not painful and does not require [[sedation]]. The patient is usually discharged within several hours following post-procedure observation provided that blood pressure is otherwise normal and the patient experiences no dizziness.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/80944-overview#a15</ref><ref>http://patients.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/gi/paracentesis.html</ref><ref>http://apps.med.buffalo.edu/procedures/paracentesis.asp?p=15</ref>

==Ascitic fluid analysis==
The [[serum-ascities albumin gradient]] can help determine the cause of the ascites.
The ascitic white blood cell count can help determine if the ascites is infected.

==Contraindications==
Mild hematologic abnormalities do not increase the risk of bleeding.<ref name="pmid1996485">{{cite journal |author=McVay PA, Toy PT |title=Lack of increased bleeding after paracentesis and thoracentesis in patients with mild coagulation abnormalities |journal=Transfusion |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=164–71 |year=1991 |pmid=1996485 |doi=10.1046/j.1537-2995.1991.31291142949.x}}</ref> The risk of bleeding may be increased if:<ref name="pmid15084697">{{cite journal |author=Ginès P, Cárdenas A, Arroyo V, Rodés J |title=Management of cirrhosis and ascites |journal=N.

* [[prothrombin time]] > 21 seconds

Absolute contraindication is acute abdomen that requires surgery.
Relative contraindications are:
* Pregnancy
* Distended urinary bladder
* Abdominal wall cellulitis
* Distended bowel
* Intra-abdominal adhesions.<ref>Paracentesis, Author: Gil Z Shlamovitz, MD; Chief Editor: Rick Kulkarni, MD, http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/80944-overview#showall</ref>
