The '''Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction''' resembles bacterial [[sepsis]] and can occur after initiation of [[antibacterial]]s, such as [[penicillin]] or [[tetracycline]], for the treatment of louse-borne relapsing fever (80-90% of patients) and in tick-borne relapsing fever (30-40%). An association has been found between the release of heat-stable proteins from [[spirochete]]s and the reaction. Typically, the death of these [[bacteria]] and the associated release of [[endotoxin]]s or lipoproteins occurs faster than the body can remove the substances. It usually manifests within a few hours of the first dose of antibiotic as [[fever]], [[chills]], [[Rigor (medicine)|rigor]], [[hypotension]], [[headache]], [[tachycardia]], [[hyperventilation]], [[vasodilation]] with [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[myalgia]] (muscle pain), exacerbation of [[skin lesion]]s and anxiety. The intensity of the reaction indicates the severity of [[inflammation]]. Reaction commonly occurs within two hours of drug [[Route of administration|administration]], but is usually self-limiting. [[Prophylaxis]] and treatment with an [[anti-inflammatory]] agent may stop progression of the reaction. Oral [[aspirin]] every four hours for 1&ndash;2 days, or 60 mg of [[prednisone]] orally or [[intravenously]] has been used as an adjunctive treatment {{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2012}}. However, steroids are generally of no benefit. Patients must be closely monitored for the potential complications (collapse and shock) and may require i.v. fluids to maintain adequate blood pressure. If available, meptazinol, an opioid antagonist, should be administered to reduce the severity of the reaction. Anti TNF-a may also be effective. 

The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is classically associated with penicillin treatment of [[syphilis]]. Duration in syphilis is normally only a few hours. The reaction is also seen in other diseases caused by spirochetes, such as [[borrelia|borreliosis]] ([[Lyme disease]] and [[relapsing fever|tick-borne relapsing fever]]) and [[leptospirosis]], and in [[Q fever]].<ref name=Harrison>{{cite book |author=Loscalzo, Joseph; Fauci, Anthony S.; Braunwald, Eugene; Dennis L.

==Pathophysiology==
The Herxheimer reaction has shown an increase in inflammatory [[cytokines]] during the period of exacerbation, including [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]], [[interleukin-6]] and [[interleukin-8]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vidal V, Scragg IG, Cutler SJ, ''et al.'' |title=Variable major lipoprotein is a principal TNF-inducing factor of louse-borne relapsing fever |journal=Nat.

Both Jarisch and Herxheimer observed reactions in patients with [[syphilis]] treated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. The reaction was first seen following treatment in early and later stages of syphilis treated with [[Salvarsan]], mercury, or [[antibiotics]]. It is seen in 50% of patients with primary syphilis and about 90% of patients with secondary syphilis.<ref name=Harrison/>
