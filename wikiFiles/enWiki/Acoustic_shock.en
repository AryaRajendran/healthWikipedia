The term '''acoustic shock''' is used to describe the [[symptom]]s a person may experience after hearing an unexpected, loud [[sound]] via a [[telephone]]. The loud sound, called an '''Acoustic Incident''', can be caused by [[feedback]] [[oscillation]], [[fax]] tones, or [[Pitch (music)|signalling tones]].
[[Telemarketers]] and call centre employees are thought to be most at risk.<ref name=ITU>ITU-T Recommendation p.10 (12/98): Vocabulary of terms on telephone transmission quality and telephone sets, Geneva, 1998.</ref>

==Reported symptoms==
During the exposure, most people will experience [[discomfort]] and [[pain]]. After the exposure, some people might report [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[nausea]] and [[anxiety]] or depression.<ref name=nal>[http://www.nal.gov.au/Info%20for%20consumers/HD%20-%20acoustic_shock-%20main.htm Acoustic Shock<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Headache]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[hypersensitivity]] to loud noise and [[tinnitus]] may continue for days, weeks or indefinitely.<ref name=dier>[http://www.deir.qld.gov.au/workplace/law/codes/noise/appendix7/index.htm Appendix 7 – Acoustic shock<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  It has not been established how such unrelated symptoms might be caused by an acoustic exposure, or whether such symptoms are even a direct result of exposure.<ref name="urlHSE - Noise: Acoustic shock">{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/noise/acoustic.htm |title=HSE - Noise: Acoustic shock |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}</ref>

==Prevention==
There are many methods of attempting to reduce the risk of AS. Several devices attempt to remove potentially harmful sound signals by digital signal processing. None has yet been shown to be fully effective. Devices which solely limit noise levels to about 85dB have been shown in field trials to be ineffective (data from these trials has not been released into the public domain). Limiting background noise and office stress may also reduce the chance of an Acoustic Shock. Proper use of the headset and preventing mobile phones from being used in call centers reduces the chance of feedback. <ref name=dier/>

==Legal Action==
84 [[BT Group|BT]] employees suffering from depression, headaches and other health problems, are demanding compensation for injury sustained from acoustic shock at work. BT has already paid £90,000 to one worker that suffered from tinnitus.<ref name=bbc1>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1165366.stm BBC News | UK | Legal action over 'acoustic shock'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
