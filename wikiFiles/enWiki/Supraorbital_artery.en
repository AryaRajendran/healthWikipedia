The '''supraorbital artery''' is an [[artery]] of the head.

==Course==
It springs from the [[ophthalmic artery]] as that vessel is crossing over to the medial side of the [[optic nerve]]. 

It passes upward on the medial borders of the [[superior rectus muscle]] and [[levator palpebrae superioris]], meeting the [[supraorbital nerve]] accompanies it between the roof of the orbit and [[levator palpebrae superioris]] to the [[supraorbital notch]].

==Branching==
When passing through the supraorbital notch it divides into a superficial and a deep branch. Its terminal branches anastomose with branches of the [[supratrochlear artery]] and the superficial temporal arteries.

==Supplies==
This artery supplies the [[levator palpebrae superioris]], the [[diploë]] of the [[frontal bone]], the [[frontal sinus]], the upper [[eyelid]], and the skin of the [[forehead]] and the [[scalp]].

This artery may be absent in 10% to 20% of individuals. <ref>Dutton JJ: Osteology of the orbit. In ''Atlas of clinical and surgical orbital anatomy,'' Philadelphia, 1994, WB Saunders</ref>
