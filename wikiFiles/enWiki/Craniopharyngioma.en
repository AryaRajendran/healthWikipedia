Craniopharyngiomas are also known as [[Rathke pouch]] tumors, hypophyseal duct tumors, or adamantinomas.

==Presentation==
[[File:Craniopharyngioma1.jpg|thumb|[[CT scan]] showing a craniopharyngioma.]]
Craniopharyngiomas are typically very slow growing tumors. They arise from the cells along the [[pituitary stalk]], specifically from nests of odontogenic (tooth-forming) epithelium within the suprasellar/diencephalic region and, therefore, contain deposits of [[calcium]], which are evident on an [[x-ray]].   They are classified by histology as [[benign]];<ref name=pmid17630614>{{cite journal

==Histology==
[[File:Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma - intermed mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing the characteristic features of an '''adamantinomatous''' craniopharyngioma - cystic spaces, calcifications, and "wet" keratin. [[HPS stain]].]]
[[File:Papillary craniopharyngioma - high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing a '''papillary''' craniopharyngioma. [[HPS stain]].]]
The [[histologic]] pattern consists of nesting of [[squamous]] [[epithelium]] bordered by radially arranged cells. It is frequently accompanied by calcium deposition and may have a microscopic papillary architecture.

Two distinct types are recognized:<ref name="pmid12466115">{{cite journal |author=Sekine S, Shibata T, Kokubu A, ''et al'' |title=Craniopharyngiomas of adamantinomatous type harbor beta-catenin gene mutations |journal=Am.

*Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma, which resemble [[adamantinoma]]s, the most common type of tooth tumor; and,
*Papillary craniopharyngioma.

In the adamantinomatous type, calcifications are visible on neuroimaging and are helpful in diagnosis.
The papillary type rarely calcifies.

On macroscopic examination, craniopharyngiomas are cystic or partially cystic with solid areas. On light microscopy, the cysts are seen to be lined by stratified squamous epithelium. Keratin pearls may also be seen. The cysts are usually filled with a yellow, viscous fluid which is rich in cholesterol crystals. In addition to a long list of possible symptoms, the most common presentation include: headaches, growth failure, and [[bitemporal hemianopsia]].

==Prognosis==
Craniopharyngiomas are generally benign but are known to recur after resection.

==Treatment==
Treatment generally consists of subfrontal or transsphenoidal excision. Surgery using the transsphenoidal route is often performed by a joint team of ENT and neurosurgeons. Because of the location of the craniopharyngioma near the brain and skullbase, a [[computer-assisted surgery|surgical navigation system]] might be used to verify the position of surgical tools during the operation.<ref>[http://www.scopis.com/en/news-events/overview/detail-view/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=88&cHash=de3fe6649791429671a310107206a5b8 Use of surgical navigation for craniopharyngioma removal] {{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> Adjuvant radiotherapy is also used if total removal is not possible. Due to the morbidities associated with damage to the pituitary and hypothalamus from surgical removal and radiation, experimental therapies using intracavitary phosphorus-32, yttrium, or bleomycin delivered via an external reservoir are frequently employed, especially in young patients. The tumor, being in the pituitary gland, can cause secondary health issues such as the following. Unstable growth hormone levels (either too little or too much, the latter causing gigantism). The immune system, thyroid levels, and testosterone levels can also be compromised from craniopharygioma. All of the before mentioned health issues can be treated with modern medicine.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 18352780 | doi=10.3171/PED/2008/1/2/124 | volume=1 | issue=2 | title=Craniopharyngioma | year=2008 | month=February | author=Wisoff JH | journal=J Neurosurg Pediatr | pages=124–5; discussion 125}}</ref>
