'''Speech disorders''' or '''speech impediments''' are a type of [[communication disorder]]s where 'normal' [[Manner of articulation|speech]] is disrupted. This can mean [[stuttering]], [[lisp (speech)|lisps]], etc. Someone who is unable to speak due to a speech disorder is considered [[muteness|mute]].

==Classification==
Classifying speech into normal and disordered is more problematic than it first seems. By a strict classification{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, only 5% to 10% of the population has a completely normal manner of speaking (with respect to all parameters) and healthy voice; all others suffer from one disorder or another.

* [[Stuttering]] affects approximately 1% of the adult population.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}
* [[Cluttering]], a speech disorder that has similarities to stuttering.
* [[Dysprosody]] is the rarest neurological speech disorder. It is characterized by alterations in intensity, in the timing of utterance segments, and in rhythm, cadence, and intonation of words. The changes to the duration, the [[fundamental frequency]], and the intensity of tonic and atonic syllables of the sentences spoken, deprive an individual's particular speech of its characteristics. The cause of dysprosody is usually associated with neurological pathologies such as [[brain vascular accident]]s, [[cranioencephalic traumatism]]s, and [[brain tumor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pinto JA, Corso RJ, Guilherme AC, Pinho SR, Nóbrega Mde O |title=Dysprosody nonassociated with neurological diseases--a case report |journal=J Voice |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=90–6 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15070228 |doi= 10.1016/j.jvoice.2003.07.005|url=}}</ref>
* [[Muteness]] is complete inability to speak
* [[Speech sound disorder]]s involve difficulty in producing specific speech sounds (most often certain consonants, such as /s/ or /r/), and are subdivided into [[Speech-Language Pathology in School Settings#Articulation disorders|articulation disorders]] (also called phonetic disorders) and [[Speech sound disorder#Phonemic Disorders|phonemic disorders]]. Articulation disorders are characterized by difficulty learning to produce sounds physically. Phonemic disorders are characterized by difficulty in learning the sound distinctions of a language, so that one sound may be used in place of many. However, it is not uncommon for a single person to have a mixed speech sound disorder with both phonemic and phonetic components.
* [[Voice disorders]] are impairments, often physical, that involve the function of the [[larynx]] or vocal resonance.
* [[Dysarthria]] is a weakness or paralysis of speech muscles caused by damage to the nerves and/or brain. Dysarthria is often caused by [[stroke]]s, [[parkinsons disease]], [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]], head or neck injuries, surgical accident, or [[cerebral palsy]].
* [[Apraxia|Apraxia of speech]] may result from stroke or be developmental, and involves inconsistent production of speech sounds and rearranging of sounds in a word ("potato" may become "topato" and next "totapo"). Production of words becomes more difficult with effort, but common phrases may sometimes be spoken spontaneously without effort. It is now considered unlikely that childhood apraxia of speech and acquired apraxia of speech are the same thing{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, though they share many characteristics.

There are three different levels of classification when determining the magnitude and type of a speech disorder and the proper treatment or therapy:<ref>Deputy, Paul; ''Human Communication Disorders''; March 10, 2008</ref>
# Sounds the patient can produce
## Phonemic- can be produced easily; used meaningfully and contrastively
## Phonetic- produced only upon request; not used consistently, meaningfully, or contrastively; not used in connected speech
# Stimulable sounds
## Easily stimulable
## Stimulable after demonstration and probing (i.e. with a tongue depressor)
# Cannot produce the sound
## Cannot be produced voluntarily
## No production ever observed

==Causes==
In many cases the cause is unknown. However, there are various known causes of speech impediments, such as "[[hearing loss]], [[neurological disorder]]s, [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]], [[mental retardation]], [[drug abuse]], physical impairments such as [[Cleft lip and palate]], and vocal abuse or misuse."<ref name="ref1">"Disability Info: Speech and Language Disorders Fact Sheet (FS11)." National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities. http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs11txt.htm</ref> [[Child abuse]] may also be a cause in some cases.<ref>http://www.lbfdtraining.com/Pages/emt/sectiond/childabuse.html Long Beach (California) Fire Department</ref>

==Treatment==
{{Globalize|date=December 2009}}
Many of these types of disorders can be treated by [[speech therapy]], but others require medical attention by a doctor in [[phoniatrics]]. Other treatments include correction of organic conditions and [[psychotherapy]].<ref>"Speech Defect." Encyclopedia.com. http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-speechde.html</ref>

In the United States, school-age children with a speech disorder are often placed in [[special education]] programs. Children who struggle to learn to talk often experience persistent communication difficulties in addition to academic struggles.<ref>Scott, G. G., O'Donnell, P. J., & Sereno, S. C. (2012). Emotion words affect eye fixations during reading. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, {{doi|10.1037/a0027209}}</ref> More than 700,000 of the students served in the public schools’ special education programs in the 2000-2001 school year were categorized as having a speech or language impediment. This estimate does not include children who have [[speech and language impairment]]s secondary to other conditions such as deafness".<ref name="ref1" /> Many [[school district]]s provide the students with speech therapy during school hours, although extended day and summer services may be appropriate under certain circumstances.

Patients will be treated in teams, depending on the type of disorder they have. A team can include SLPs, specialists, family doctors, teachers,and family members.

==Social effects==
Suffering from a speech disorder can have negative social effects, especially among young children. Those with a speech disorder can be targets of [[bullying]] because of their disorder. The bullying can result in decreased [[self-esteem]]. Later in life, bullying is experienced less by a general population, as people become more understanding as they age.

==Language disorders==

[[Language disorder]]s are usually considered distinct from speech disorders, even though they are often used synonymously.

Speech disorders refer to problems in producing the sounds of speech or with the quality of voice, where language disorders are usually an impairment of either understanding words or being able to use words and does not have to do with speech production<ref>[http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs11txt.htm Disability Info: Speech and Language Disorders Fact Sheet (FS11)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
