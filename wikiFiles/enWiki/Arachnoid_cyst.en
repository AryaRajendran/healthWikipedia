(PMID 15625636)</ref> and most cases begin during infancy; however, onset may be delayed until adolescence.<ref name="ninds" />

==Classification==
Arachnoid cysts can be found on the brain, or on the [[Vertebral column|spine]].  Intracranial arachnoid cysts usually occur adjacent to the arachnoidal cistern.<ref name="joynt">Arachnoid cyst. (n.d.). Gale Encyclopedia of Neurological Disorders. Retrieved September 10, 2006, from Answers.com Web site: http://www.answers.com/topic/arachnoid-cyst</ref>  Spinal arachnoid cysts may be extradural, intradural, or perineural and tend to present with signs and symptoms indicative of a [[radiculopathy]].<ref name="joynt" />

Arachnoid cysts may also be classified as primary (congenital) or secondary (acquired) and have been reported in humans, cats, and dogs <ref>Reed SD, Cho DY, Paulsen D. Quadrigeminal Arachnoid Cysts in a kitten and a dog. J Vet Diagn Invest 2009. 21(5):707-710.</ref>

Arachnoid cysts can be relatively [[wiktionary:asymptomatic|asymptomatic]] or present with [[wiktionary:insidious|insidious]] symptoms; for this reason, diagnosis is often delayed.

==Signs and symptoms==
Patients with arachnoid cysts may never show symptoms, even in some cases where the cyst is large. Therefore, while the presence of symptoms may provoke further clinical investigation, symptoms independent of further data cannot—and should not—be interpreted as evidence of a cyst's existence, size or location.

Symptoms vary by the size and location of the cyst(s), though small cysts usually have no symptoms and are discovered only incidentally.<ref name="ninds" /> On the other hand, a number of symptoms may result from large cysts:
*Cranial deformation or [[macrocephaly]] (enlargement of the head), particularly in children<ref name="azguide">Barker RA, Scolding N, Rowe D, Larner AJ. ''The A-Z of Neurological Practice: A Guide to Clinical Neurology'' [[Cambridge University Press]] 2005 Jan 10, p61. (ISBN 0-521-62960-8)</ref>
*Cysts in the suprasellar region in children have presented as bobbing and nodding of the head called [[bobble-head doll syndrome]].<ref name="azguide" />

*[[Headache]]s.<ref name="ninds" />  A patient experiencing a headache does not necessarily have an arachnoid cyst.

*Most neurosurgeons remain skeptical on the correlation between arachnoid cyst and mental illness and consider the two partially related.

==Causes==
The exact cause of arachnoid cysts is not known. Researchers believe that most cases of arachnoid cysts are developmental malformations that arise from the unexplained splitting or tearing of the arachnoid membrane.

In some cases, arachnoid cysts occurring in the middle fossa are accompanied by underdevelopment ([[hypoplasia]]) or compression of the [[temporal lobe]]. The exact role that temporal lobe abnormalities play in the development of [[middle fossa]] arachnoid cysts is unknown.

There are some cases where hereditary disorders have been connected with arachnoid cysts.<ref>Schievink WI, Huston J 3rd, Torres VE, Marsh WR. "Intracranial cysts in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease" ''J Neurosurg'' 1995 Dec;83(6):1004-7. (PMID 7490613)</ref>

Some complications of arachnoid cysts can occur when a cyst is damaged because of minor [[head trauma]]. Trauma can cause the fluid within a cyst to leak into other areas (e.g., [[subarachnoid space]]). Blood vessels on the surface of a cyst may tear and bleed into the cyst (intracystic [[hemorrhage]]), increasing its size. If a blood vessel bleeds on the outside of a cyst, a collection of blood ([[hematoma]]) may result. In the cases of intracystic hemorrhage and hematoma, the individual may have symptoms of increased pressure within the cranium and signs of compression of nearby nerve (neural) tissue.

A scientific debate is whether arachnoid cysts are a true congenite condition or if this should be separated from secondary cysts.<ref>Westermaier T, Schweitzer T, Ernestus RI. "Arachnoid cysts" ''Adv Exp Med Biol'' 2012 724:37-50. (PMID 22411232)</ref>  A recent study show differences in communication between the arachnoid cyst and the subarachnoid space by CT cisternography

(PMID 22520095)</ref> A comparison of arachnoid cyst fluid and CSF in a series of patients show difference in chemical composition.<ref>Berle M, Wester KG, Ulvik RJ, Kroksveen AC, Haaland OA, Amiry-Moghaddam M, Berven FS, Helland CA, "Arachnoid cysts do not contain cerebrospinal fluid: A comparative chemical analysis of arachnoid cyst fluid and cerebrospinal fluid in adults" ''Cerebrospinal Fluid Res'' 2010 Jun 10;7(1):8. (PMID 20537169)</ref>

Arachnoid cysts can also occur secondary to other disorders such as [[Marfan syndrome]], [[arachnoiditis]], or [[agenesis of the corpus callosum]].

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Temporale Arachnoidalzyste links CT axial.jpg|thumb|Axial CT showing a typical arachnoid cyst left temporal]]
Diagnosis is principally by [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]].  Frequently, arachnoid cysts are incidental findings on MRI scans performed for other clinical reasons.  In practice, diagnosis of symptomatic arachnoid cysts requires symptoms to be present, and many with the disorder never develop symptoms.

Additional clinical assessment tools that can be useful in evaluating a patient with arachnoid cysts include the [[mini-mental state examination]] (MMSE), a brief questionnaire-based test used to assess [[cognition]].<ref name="dementia" />

==Treatment/Management==
Most arachnoid cysts are asymptomatic and do not require treatment. Treatment may be necessary when symptomatic.<ref name="ninds" />  A variety of procedures may be used to decompress (remove pressure from) the cyst.

*Surgical placement of a [[cerebral shunt]]:<ref>Strojnik T. "Different approaches to surgical treatment of arachnoid cysts", ''Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift.''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/f8j635026q64685h/] 2006;118 Suppl 2:85-8. (PMID 16817052)</ref>

**A '''cystoperitoneal shunt''' drains to the [[peritoneal cavity]].<ref>Park SW, Yoon SH, Cho KH, Shin YS. "A large arachnoid cyst of the lateral ventricle extending from the supracerebellar cistern—case report", ''Surg Neurol'' 2006 Jun;65(6):611-14. (PMID 16720186)</ref>
*[[wikt:fenestration|Fenestration]]:
**[[Craniotomy]] with [[surgery|excision]]<ref>Gangemi M, Colella G, Magro F, Maiuri F. "Suprasellar arachnoid cysts: endoscopy versus microsurgical cyst excision and shunting", ''Br J Neurosurg'' 2007 Jun;21(3):276-80. (PMID 17612918)</ref>
**Various [[Endoscope|endoscopic]] techniques are proving effective,<ref>Greenfield JP, Souweidane MM. "Endoscopic management of intracranial cysts", ''Neurosurg Focus.'' 2005 Dec 15;19(6):E7. (PMID 16398484)</ref> including laser-assisted techniques.<ref>Van Beijnum J, Hanlo PW, Han KS, Ludo Van der Pol W, Verdaasdonk RM, Van Nieuwenhuizen O. "Navigated laser-assisted endoscopic fenestration of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst in a 2-year-old child with bobble-head doll syndrome", ''J Neurosurg.'' 2006 May;104(5 Suppl):348-51. (PMID 16848093)</ref>
*Drainage by [[needle aspiration]] or [[burr hole]].
*Capsular resection<ref name="eld" />
*Pharmacological treatments may address specific symptoms such as seizures or pain.

== Prognosis ==
Most arachnoid cysts are asymptomatic, and do not require treatment.  Where complications are present, leaving arachnoid cysts untreated, may cause permanent severe neurological damage due to the progressive expansion of the cyst(s) or [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding).<ref name="ninds" /> However, with treatment most individuals with symptomatic arachnoid cysts do well.

More specific prognoses are listed below:
*Patients with impaired preoperative [[cognition]] had postoperative improvement after surgical decompression of the cyst.<ref>Wester K, Hugdahl K. "Arachnoid cysts of the left temporal fossa: impaired preoperative cognition and postoperative improvement." ''J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry'' 1995 Sep;59(3):293-8. (PMID 7673959)</ref><ref>Wester K. "Intracranial arachnoid cysts--do they impair mental functions?" ''J Neurol'' 2008 Aug;255(8):1113-20. (PMID 18677648)</ref>
*Surgery can resolve psychiatric manifestations in selected cases.<ref>Kohn R, Lilly RB, Sokol MS, Malloy PF. "Psychiatric presentations of intracranial cysts", ''J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci'' 1989; 1:60-66. (PMID 2577719)</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Arachnoid cysts are seen in up to 1.1% of the population<ref name="MassNeur">Flaherty AW. ''The Massachusetts General Hospital Handbook of Neurology'' 2000 Jan 1;105. (ISBN 0-683-30576-X)</ref><ref>Vernooij MW, Ikram MA, Tanghe HL, Vincent AJ, Hofman A, Krestin GP, Niessen WJ, Breteler MM, van der Lugt A.

"Arachnoid cysts: case series and review of the literature" 'Neurosurg Focus'' 2007 Feb 15;22(2):E7. (PMID 17608350)</ref>  Only 20% of these have symptoms, usually from secondary [[hydrocephalus]].<ref name="MassNeur" />

A study that looked at 2,536 healthy young males found a prevalence of 1.7% (95% [[Confidence interval|CI]] 1.2 to 2.3%). Only a small percentage of the detected abnormalities require urgent medical attention.<ref name="nmn">Weber F, Knopf H. "Incidental findings in magnetic resonance imaging of the brains of healthy young men", ''J Neurol Sci.'' 2006 Jan 15;240(1-2):81-4. Epub 2005 Oct 26. (PMID 16256141)</ref>
