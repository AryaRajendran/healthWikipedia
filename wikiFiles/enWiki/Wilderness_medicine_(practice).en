'''Wilderness medicine''' , providing "vital emergency care in remote settings" <ref>ref name= Weiss|A Comprehensive Guide to Wilderness & Travel Medicine Book|Eric A. Weiss</ref> is a rapidly evolving field and is of increasing importance as more people engage in hiking, climbing, kayaking and other potentially hazardous activities in the backcountry.<ref>"http://emed.stanford.edu/fellowships/wilderness.html|bare url|Wilderness Medicine is a rapidly evolving field that is increasingly important as large numbers of people are involved in outdoor activities for adventure, science, recreation, exploration, industry, combat, and disaster relief"</ref> A primary focus of the field is the evaluation, prioritization ([[triage]]), preliminary treatment of acute injuries or illnesses which occur in those environments and the emergency evacuation of victims. However, back country rescue and [[wilderness first aid]] is not the sole activity of wilderness medical professionals, who are also concerned with many additional topics. These include but are not limited to:
* secondary care follow up to first aid in remote settings, such as expeditions
* evaluation of experience and issuance of updated protocols for first response and secondary care
*  the prevention of wilderness medical emergencies,
*  epidemiological studies,
* public policy advisement to wilderness planning agencies, issuance of guidelines to disaster planning agencies,<ref>"Preparation through education is less costly than learning through tragedy" - Max Mayfield, Director National Hurricane Center|Cited by Weiss</ref> professional guides and amateur back country enthusiast organizations.<ref>Weiss</ref>
