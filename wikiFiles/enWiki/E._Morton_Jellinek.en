}}'''Elvin Morton "Bunky" Jellinek''' (1890–1963),  '''E. Morton Jellinek''', or most often, '''E. M. Jellinek''', was a [[biostatistician]], [[physiologist]], and an [[alcoholism]] [[researcher]]. He was born in [[New York City]] and died at the desk of his study at [[Stanford University]] on 22 October 1963. He was fluent in nine languages and could communicate in four others. Addiction researcher [[Griffith Edwards]] holds that, in his opinion, Jellinek's ''The Disease Concept of Alcoholism'' was a work of outstanding scholarship based on a careful consideration of the available evidence.<ref>Griffith Edwards. ''Alcohol: The World's Favourite Drug''. 1st US ed. Thomas Dunne Books: 2002. ISBN 0-312-28387-3. P 98.</ref>

==Academic career==

Jellinek studied biostatistics and physiology at the [[University of Berlin]] from 1908 to 1910.  He then studied [[philosophy]], [[philology]], [[anthropology]], and [[theology]] for two years at the [[Joseph Fourier University]] in [[Grenoble]]. He was also enrolled, apparently concurrently, at the [[University of Leipzig]] from 25 November 1911 to 29 July 1913, and from 22 November 1913 to 2 December 1914 for classes in languages, linguistics and cultural history.<ref> Page, P.B., "E. M. Jellinek and the Evolution of Alcohol Studies: A Critical Essay", Addiction, Vol.92, No.12, (December 1997), pp.1619–1637 </ref>

During the 1920s, he conducted research in [[Sierra Leone]] and at [[Tela]], [[Honduras]]. In the 1930s he returned to the U.S.A. and worked at the Worcester State Hospital, [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], from whence he was commissioned to conduct a study for the ''Research Council on Problems of Alcohol''. The eventual outcome of his study was the 1942 book, ''Alcohol Addiction and Chronic Alcoholism''.

From 1941 to 1952, he was Associate Professor of Applied Physiology at [[Yale University]]. In 1941 he was managing editor of the newly established [[Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol]] (now the [[Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs]]).<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.jsad.com/jsad/static/about.html |title=About the Journal |accessdate=2010-09-09 |publisher=Center of Alcohol Studies, [[Rutgers University]]}}</ref>  In 1952 he was engaged by the [[World Health Organization]] in Geneva as a consultant on alcoholism, and made significant contributions to the work of the alcoholism sub-committee of the W.H.O.'s ''Expert Committee on Mental Health''.  

Upon his retirement from the W.H.O. in the late 1950s, he returned to the USA. In 1958 he joined the Psychiatry Schools of both the [[University of Toronto]] and the [[University of Alberta]], and in 1962, he moved to Stanford University in California, where he remained until his death.<ref>For more information, see 1964 obituary in ''The American Journal of Psychiatry'' [http://www.jellinekaward.org]</ref>

=== Disease concept of alcoholism === 
{{main|Disease theory of alcoholism}}

In 1849, the Swedish Physician Magnus Huss (1807–1890)<ref>He was physician to the Swedish kings [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Charles XIV]] and [[Oscar I of Sweden|Oscar I]].</ref> was the first to systematically classify the damage that was attributable to alcohol ingestion. Huss coined the term [[alcoholism]] and used it to label what he considered to be a chronic, relapsing disease.<ref>The term first appeared (in 1849) in the Swedish edition of '''''Alcoholismus Chronicus''', or Chronic Alcohol Illness. A Contribution to the Study of Dyscrasias Based on my Personal Experience and the Experience of Others'', which was soon translated to German (1852) and later into English.</ref>

Jellinek coined the expression "[[Disease theory of alcoholism|the disease concept of alcoholism]]",<ref>It also appears as the title of his 1960 book, ''The Disease Concept of Alcoholism''.</ref> and significantly accelerated the movement towards the [[medicalization]] of [[drunkenness]] and alcohol [[habituation]]. 

Jellinek’s initial 1946 study was funded by Marty Mann<ref>Marty Mann (1905–1980), the first female member of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]</ref> and R. Brinkley Smithers<ref>In his lifetime, R. Brinkley Smithers (1907–1994) – an American philanthropist, and founder of the ''Christopher D. Smithers Foundation'', which had been named after his father, an IBM founder (via the ''Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation''), and a Director of IBM (1913–1952) – a self-styled "recovering alcoholic", donated more than $US40 million to alcoholism programs; $US13.5 million through the Smithers Foundation, and $US28 million from his own his personal funds.(Peele[http://www.peele.net/lib/smithers.html])</ref> (Falcone, 2003). It was based on a narrow, selective study of a hand-picked group of members of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] ('''AA''') who had returned a self-reporting questionnaire.<ref>Of the 158 questionnaires returned, Marty Mann selected 98; and it was upon this hand-picked population that Jellinek’s reported in his 1946 study.</ref> Valverde opines that a biostatistician of Jellinek’s eminence would have been only too well aware of the "unscientific status" of the "dubiously scientific data that had been collected by AA members".<ref>Valverde (1998), pp.110–111; Valverde also noted that the AA questionnaire that was the source for Jellinek's classification only had relevance to "the experience of white, male, middle-class alcoholics in the 1940s" (p.110).</ref>

In his 1960 book he identified five different types of alcoholism, and defined them in terms of their abnormal physiological processes:
:''In order to differentiate alcoholism not just [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]]ally, along a time line but also [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]ally across groups of people, thus distinguishing '''types''' of alcoholics in a way that ran quite counter to the AA emphasis on the unity of all alcoholics, Jellinek came up with the idea of grouping different drinking patterns and naming them by giving each a Greek letter. One might think that the purpose of such a classification is to expand the range of alcoholism and include as many people as possible under the "disease concept"; but, contrary to what the title suggests, Jellinek's 1960 magnum opus in fact tries to limit the scope of the "disease concept", stating that most of the types described might be alcoholics, but they are not diseased – because they do not suffer from "loss of control".''<ref>Valverde, 1998, p.111.</ref>

* '''Alpha alcoholism''': the earliest stage of the disease, manifesting the purely psychological continual dependence on the effects of alcohol to relieve bodily or emotional pain. This is the "problem drinker", whose drinking creates social and personal problems. Whilst there are significant social and personal problems, these people can stop if they really want to; thus, argued Jellinek, they have not lost control, and as a consequence, do not have a "disease".
* '''Beta alcoholism''': [[polyneuropathy]], or [[cirrhosis of the liver]] from alcohol without physical or psychological dependence. These are the heavy drinkers that drink a lot, almost every day. They do not have physical [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and do not suffer [[withdrawal]] [[symptoms]]. This group do not have a "disease".  
* '''Gamma alcoholism''': involving acquired tissue tolerance, physical dependence, and loss of control. This is the AA alcoholic, who is very much out of control, and does, by Jellinek's classification, have a "disease".<ref>"''It is characterized by binge drinking and a slow downward slide into helplessness''"(Valverde, 1998, p.112).</ref>
* '''Delta alcoholism''': as in '''Gamma alcoholism''', but with inability to abstain, instead of loss of control.
* '''Epsilon alcoholism''': the most advanced stage of the disease, manifesting as [[dipsomania]], or periodic alcoholism.

:''While Jellinek's classification draws a clear (if arbitrary) line between the garden-variety alcoholic and the truly diseased alcoholic, it does not draw such a clear boundary between alcoholism in general and normal drinking. This is Jellinek's [[Achilles' heel]] . . .''
:''By relying on cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s to define several of his types, he implicitly gives up the project of providing a single, objective, universally valid clinical definition of alcoholism, and opens the door to anthropological [[nominalist]]ic definitions along the lines of "whatever is normal drinking in that particular culture is normal drinking".'' (Valverde, 1998, p.112)

The "Jellinek curve"<ref>[http://www.in.gov/judiciary/ijlap/jellinek.pdf]</ref> is derived from this classification of Jellinek, and it was named out of respect for Jellinek’s work.<ref>[http://hindsfoot.org/BSV02Psy.html William E. Swegan, 2. The Psychology of Alcoholism<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Jellinek later completely dissociated himself from this chart's representations; however it is still known as the "Jellinek curve".

=== Recognition of placebo effect ===
{{main|Placebo}}
In post-war 1946, pharmaceutical chemicals were in short supply. A headache remedy manufacturer found that supplies of one of its remedy’s three constituent chemicals was running out.

They asked Jellinek, then at Yale, to test whether the absence of that particular chemical would affect the drug’s [[efficacy]] in any way. Jellinek set up a complex trial – with 199 subjects, divided randomly into four test groups – involving various [[permutation]]s of the three drug constituents, with a [[placebo]] as a [[scientific control]]. Each group took a test remedy for two weeks. The trial lasted eight weeks, by the end of which each group had taken each test drugs, albeit in a different sequence. Over the entire population of 199 subjects, 120 of the subjects responded to the placebo, and 79 did not. The trial demonstrated that the chemical in question significantly contributed to the remedy's efficacy.

In the process of examining the data produced by his trial, Jellinek discovered that there was a significant difference in responses to the active chemicals between the 120 who had responded to the placebo and the 79 who did not. He (1946, p.90) described the former group as being "''reactors to '''placebo'''''", and this seems to be the first time that anyone had spoken of either "''placebo reactions''" or "''placebo responses''".<ref>This is 10 years prior to Beecher's 1955 paper, "The Powerful Placebo", which is commonly and incorrectly named as the source of the term; see [[Placebo (origins of technical term)]].</ref>
