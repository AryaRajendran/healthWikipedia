'''Seminoma''' (also known as ''pure seminoma'' or ''classical seminoma'') is a [[germ cell tumor]] of the [[testis]] or, more rarely, the [[mediastinum]] or other extra-gonadal locations. It is a malignant neoplasm and is one of the most treatable and curable cancers, with a survival rate above 95% if discovered in early stages.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001288.htm Testicular cancer], Medline Plus</ref> 

Testicular seminoma originates in the [[Germinal epithelium (male)|germinal epithelium]] of the [[seminiferous tubule]]s.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000095781|Seminoma}}</ref> About half of germ cell tumors of the testis are seminomas.<ref name=Sternberg>Mills, S (ed.) 2009.Sternberg's Diagnostic Pathology. 5th Edition. ISBN 978-0-7817-7942-5</ref> Treatment usually requires removal of one testis, but this does not affect fertility or other sexual functioning. 

==Presentation==
The average age of diagnosis is 40 years.  This is about 5 to 10 years older than men with other germ cell tumors of the testes.  In most cases, they produce masses that are readily felt on [[testicular self-examination]]; however, in up to 11 percent of cases, there may be no mass able to be felt, or there may be [[testicular atrophy]].  Testicular pain is reported in up to one fifth of cases.  Low back pain may occur after [[metastasis]] to the [[retroperitoneum]].<ref name=Weidner>Weidner N. Germ-cell tumors of the mediastinum. Semin Diagn Pathol. Feb 1999;16(1):42-50.</ref>

Some cases of seminoma can present as a primary tumour outside the testis, most commonly in the [[mediastinum]].<ref name=Weidner/>  In the [[ovary]], the tumor is called a [[dysgerminoma]], and in non-[[gonad]]al sites, particularly the [[central nervous system]], it is called a [[germinoma]].<ref name=Sternberg/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Blood test]]s may detect the presence of placental [[alkaline phosphatase]] (PLAP) in fifty percent of cases. However, PLAP cannot usefully stand alone as a marker for seminoma and contributes little to follow-up, due to its rise with smoking.<ref>Nielsen et al, Eur J Cancer. 1990;26(10):1049-54</ref>  [[Human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) may be elevated in some cases, but this correlates more to the presence of [[trophoblast]] cells within the tumour than to the stage of the tumour. Serum [[alpha fetoprotein]] is not elevated in classical seminoma.<ref name=Sternberg/>

The cut surface of the tumour is fleshy and lobulated, and varies in colour from cream to tan to pink.  The tumour tends to bulge from the cut surface, and small areas of [[hemorrhage]] may be seen.  These areas of hemorrhage usually correspond to trophoblastic cell clusters within the tumour.<ref name=Sternberg/>

Microscopic examination shows that seminomas are usually composed of either a sheet-like or lobular pattern of cells with a fibrous [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]]l network.  The fibrous septa almost always contain focal [[lymphocyte]] inclusions, and [[granuloma]]s are sometimes seen.  The tumour cells themselves typically have abundant clear to pale pink cytoplasm containing abundant [[glycogen]], which is demonstrable with a [[periodic acid-Schiff]] (PAS) stain.  The nuclei are prominent and usually contain one or two large nucleoli, and have prominent nuclear membranes.  Foci of [[syncytiotrophoblast]]ic cells may be present in varied amounts.  The adjacent testicular tissue commonly shows [[intratubular germ cell neoplasia]], and may also show variable spermatocytic maturation arrest.<ref name=Sternberg/>

[[POU2AF1]] and [[PROM1]] have been proposed as possible markers.<ref name="pmid17785371">{{cite journal |author=Gashaw I, Dushaj O, Behr R, ''et al.'' |title=Novel germ cell markers characterize testicular seminoma and fetal testis |journal=Mol. Hum. Reprod. |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=721–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17785371 |doi=10.1093/molehr/gam059}}</ref>

==Treatment==
In recent years, these tumors have been shown to have dramatic sensitivity to both [[radiotherapy]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Radiation | publisher = Testicular Cancer Library | url=http://www.tc-library.com/radiation/ | accessdate = 2009-02-01 }}</ref> and [[cytotoxic]] [[chemotherapy]]. The management of childhood seminoma is similar to that of adult seminoma. [[Inguinal orchiectomy]] is required in almost all cases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

5-year survival rate is approximately 90% as of 2008.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

A study of 31 men with metastatic [[germ cell tumor]] of the testis and delayed [[orchidectomy]] found that in men with pure seminoma, chemotherapy alone was sufficient to eliminate the cancer from the testis.  The authors of this study suggest that treatment of pure seminoma may not require orchidectomy.  Event-free survival of this group of men at an average followup of 4 years was 81.8%.<ref name="pmid18093814">{{cite journal

==Relation to ''spermatocytic seminoma''==
[[Spermatocytic seminoma]]s are not considered a [[subtype]] of seminoma and unlike other germ cell tumours do not arise from ''[[intratubular germ cell neoplasia]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Müller J, Skakkebaek NE, Parkinson MC |title=The spermatocytic seminoma: views on pathogenesis |journal=Int.
