The '''Wayne State University School of Medicine''' ('''WSUSOM''') is the largest single-campus [[medical school]] in the [[United States]].  It currently hosts an enrollment of more than 1,000 medical students in undergraduate medical education, master’s degree, Ph.D., and M.D.-Ph.D. programs and courses encompass 14 areas of basic science. WSUSOM traces its roots through four predecessor institutions since its founding in 1868.

The '''Detroit College of Medicine''' was founded in 1868 in a building on [[Woodward Avenue]] adjacent to [[Harper University Hospital]].  '''The Michigan College of Medicine''' was incorporated in 1879 and offered classes in the former Hotel Hesse at the intersection of Gratiot Avenue, Madison Avenue and St. Antoine Street. In 1885, the two schools merged to form the Detroit College of Medicine and occupied the former Michigan College of Medicine building. The college was reorganized and refinanced as the '''Detroit College of Medicine and Surgery''' in 1913, and five-years later, came under control of the [[Detroit Public Schools|Detroit Board of Education]].  In 1933, the Board of Education joined the Detroit College of Medicine and Surgery with the colleges of Liberal Arts, Education, Engineering, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School to form an institution of [[higher education]] called the Colleges of the City of Detroit.  This was renamed Wayne University in 1934 and became a state-chartered institution, [[Wayne State University]], in 1956.<ref name="timeline">{{cite web| title=Historical Timeline| url=http://www.wayne.edu/profiles/timeline.html| publisher=Wayne State University| accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref>  

==Overview==

The School of Medicine’s mission is to provide first-rate medical education while leading the field through research and patient care. The school ranks 22nd in total research expenditures in health sciences with a research portfolio exceeding $99 million annually, according to the National Science Foundation.<ref name="nsf">{{cite press release| title=School's Research Ranking Climbs| url=http://www.med.wayne.edu/press/2000/press20.htm| publisher=Wayne State University| date=21 February 2000| accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref>  The faculty consists of over 2,000 physicians, many who are members of the Wayne State University Physician Group, and provide care at eleven affiliated hosptials, clinics and training sites throughout the area.

Although the school’s faculty offer expertise in virtually all medical fields, the institution’s areas of research emphasis include cancer, women’s and children’s health, neuroscience and population studies. Many are academic leaders at national and international levels in [[CytoJournal|editorial roles]]. Research highlights in these areas include:

WSUSOM’s Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology ranks first in the country in terms of total funding from the [[National Institutes of Health]]. It is the home to the NIH Perinatology Research Branch, which is dedicated to improving the quality of maternal-fetal health nationwide. The department pioneered several innovative therapies in this field of medicine, including fetal surgery to treat birth defects in the womb, the first-ever successful in-utero bone-marrow transplant and Michigan’s first in-vitro fertilization program.

Professors at the school provided the "first evidence that [[glucose]] is a major stimulant on [[insulin]] secretion and, while and increase in the concentration of blood glucose stimulates the secretion of insulin, a decrease inhibits it and, in addition, stimulates the secretion of a blood-sugar raising factor ([[glucagon]]) by the [[pancreas]]. Subsequent experiments contributed substantially to the establishment of [[glucagon]] as a "second pancreatic hormone"." <ref name="foa">{{cite web| url=http://www.dantemichigan.org/bio/bio%20foa%20Wayne.htm| publisher=Dante Alighieri Society—Michigan Chapter| title=Piero P.

The first successful open heart surgery was performed at the [[Detroit Medical Center]] by Wayne State University physician Dr. [[Forest Dodrill]] on patient [[Henry Opitek]]. He used a machine developed by himself and researchers at General Motors, the [[Dodrill-GMR]], considered to be the first operational [[mechanical heart]] used while performing open heart surgery.<ref name="aha">{{cite press release| author=American Heart Association| title=The Mechanical Heart celebrates 50 lifesaving years| date=22 October 2002| url= http://www.charitywire.com/charity8/03284.html| publisher=Charitywire.com| accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref><ref name="dodrill">{{cite press release| url=http://www.med.wayne.edu/news_media/2002/press14.asp| publisher=Wayne State University| title=50th Anniversary of First Open Heart Surgery| accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news

Wayne State University School of Medicine is the academic affiliate of the [[Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute]], one of 26 [[NCI-designated Cancer Center]]s in the United States.  WSUSOM researchers, in conjunction with Karmanos Cancer Institute, oversee more than 400 clinical trials, participate in a national program to collect and study cancer data for future research and provide about half of all national statistics on cancer in African Americans. The first drug approved for the treatment of [[AIDS]] and [[HIV infection]], [[Zidovudine]] was synthesized here.  WSUSOM and Karmanos furthered their partnership in 2009, signing an agreement to establish a new academic department at the school for Karmanos researchers and expand their already successful research and teaching partnership.

The school has a major program of emphasis in the neurosciences, including neurology, neurotrauma, neuromuscular and degenerative diseases, vision sciences, neurobehavioral sciences and neuro-imaging. WSU is also home to the Ligon Research Center of Vision, one of the few centers in the world working on both retinal and cortical implants to restore sight and advance artificial vision, as well as the newly established and highly innovative Center for Spinal Cord Injury Recovery.

The medical school is the site of an innovative pilot study to expand ultrasound education to medical students as part of the [[NASA]] funded [[Advanced Diagnosis in Microgravity]] Project (ADUM) led by Dr. [[Scott Dulchavsky]]. The University is the first Medical School in the United States to implement this measure.

Wayne State University School of Medicine is primarily affiliated for [[Medical education in the United States|undergraduate]] and [[graduate medical education|graduate]] medical education with the hospitals of the [[Detroit Medical Center]], and [[Henry Ford Health System]].  The Detroit Medical Center includes the [[Children's Hospital of Michigan]], the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan]], [[Detroit Receiving Hospital]], [[Harper University Hospital]], [[Hutzel Women's Hospital]], [[Sinai-Grace Hospital]], [[Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital]] and the [[DMC Surgery Hospital]].  Primary affiliates within the HFHS are [[Henry Ford Hospital]], Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital, and Henry Ford Kingswood Hospital, a comprehensive psychiatric facility.  Detroit Receiving Hospital and Henry Ford Hospital are [[Trauma center#Level I|Level 1 Trauma Centers]], Children's Hospital of Michigan is a [[Trauma center#Pediatric Trauma Centers|Pediatric Level 1 Trauma Center]].  Additionally, it coordinates teaching experiences for students and residents with 14 community hospitals through the Southeast Michigan Center for Medical Education.

==Community Care==

The school’s ties to the community are strong. As the only medical school based in Detroit, WSU has a stated mission to improve the overall health of the community. As part of this mission, the School has established with the help of a $6 million NIH grant the Center for Urban & African-American Health to seek new ways to redress health disparities by identifying preventive strategies and therapeutic approaches to chronic diseases that plague this population, namely obesity, cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Perhaps the most significant contribution the School provides to the community is care to area residents who are under- or uninsured. Along with the [[Detroit Medical Center]], WSU faculty physicians provide an average of $150 million in uncompensated care annually.

WSU sponsors a number of community-service and health-awareness programs in southeastern Michigan, including mental-health screenings, Diabetes Day, the Community Health Child Immunization Project, the Detroit Cardiovascular Coalition and Brain Awareness Week. In addition to faculty-sponsored programs, WSU medical students are among the most active in the country for community outreach. The medical students, with supervision, regularly provide free medical care for homeless and unemployed patients at Detroit’s Cass Clinic. Student-sponsored outreach programs also include Senior Citizen Outreach Project, Adolescent Substance Abuse Prevention Program and Teen Pregnancy Education Program.
