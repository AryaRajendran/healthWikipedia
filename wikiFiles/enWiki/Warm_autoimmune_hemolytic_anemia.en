'''Warm Antibody Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia''' (WAIHA) is the most common of the [[Autoimmune diseases|autoimmune]] [[Hemolysis|hemolytic]] diseases.<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |pages=637 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  About half of the cases are [[idiopathic]], with the other half attributable to a predisposing condition or medications being taken.

==Pathophysiology==
The most common [[antibody]] involved in warm antibody AIHA is [[IgG]], though sometimes [[IgA]] is found.  The IgG antibodies attach to a red blood cell, leaving their F<sub>C</sub> portion exposed with maximal reactivity at 37°C (versus cold antibody induced hemolytic anemia whose antibodies only bind red blood cells at low body temperatures, typically 28-31°C).  The F<sub>C</sub> region is recognized and grabbed onto by F<sub>C</sub> receptors found on monocytes and macrophages in the [[spleen]].  These cells will pick off portions of the red cell membrane, almost like they are taking a bite.  The loss of membrane causes the red blood cells to become [[spherocyte]]s.  Spherocytes are not as flexible as normal RBCs, and will be singled-out for destruction in the [[red pulp]] of the spleen as well as other portions of the reticuloendothelial system. The red blood cells trapped in the spleen cause the spleen to enlarge, leading to the [[splenomegaly]] often seen in these patients.

There are two models for this: the [[hapten]] model and the autoantibody model.  The hapten model proposes that certain drugs, especially [[penicillin]] and [[cephalosporins]], will bind to certain proteins on the red cell membrane and act as haptens (small molecules that can elicit an immune response only when attached to a large carrier such as a protein; the carrier may be one that also does not elicit an immune response by itself).  Antibodies are created against the protein-drug complex, leading to the destructive sequence described above.  The autoantibody model proposes that, through a mechanism not yet understood, certain drugs will cause antibodies to be made against red blood cells which again leads to the same destructive sequence.

It is possible for it to occur in an immunocompromised patient.<ref name="pmid11846306">{{cite journal |author=Nowak-Wegrzyn A, King KE, Shirey RS, Chen AR, McDonough C, Lederman HM |title=Fatal warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia resulting from IgM autoagglutinins in an infant with severe combined immunodeficiency |journal=J.

==Causes==
AIHA may be:
* Idiopathic, that is, without any known cause<ref name=Jenkins>[http://www.trcc.org/blood/10b_autoimmune.pdf AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA (AIHA)] By J.L. Jenkins. The Regional Cancer Center. 2001</ref>
* Secondary to another disease, such as an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection, [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]<ref>Citation:  H. Rehman : Hemolytic Anemia following Mycoplasma Infection .  The Internet Journal of Hematology.  2008 Volume 4 Number 1 [http://www.ispub.com/journal/the_internet_journal_of_hematology/volume_4_number_1_22/article/hemolytic_anemia_following_mycoplasma_infection.html]</ref> or a malignancy, such as [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL)<ref name=Jenkins/>
* Associated with receiving a drug<ref name=Jenkins/>

==Clinical findings==
Laboratory findings include severe [[anemia]], increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV, due to the presence of a large number of young erythrocytes), and [[hyperbilirubinemia]] (from increased red cell destruction) that can be of the conjugated or unconjugated type.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made by a positive direct [[Coombs test]], other lab tests, and clinical examination and history.  The direct Coombs test looks for antibodies attached to the surface of red blood cells.

==Treatment==
[[Corticosteroids]] and immunoglobulins are two commonly used treatments for warm antibody AIHA. Initial medical treatment consists of prednisone. If ineffective, [[splenectomy]] should be considered. 

If refractory to both these therapies, other options include [[rituximab]],<ref name="pmid12001903">{{cite journal |author=Morselli M, Luppi M, Potenza L, ''et al.'' |title=Mixed warm and cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia: complete recovery after 2 courses of rituximab treatment |journal=Blood |volume=99 |issue=9 |pages=3478–9 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=12001903 |doi= 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0018|url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12001903}}</ref><ref name="pmid19123460">{{cite journal |author=Bussone G, Ribeiro E, Dechartres A, ''et al.'' |title=Efficacy and safety of rituximab in adults' warm antibody autoimmune haemolytic anemia: Retrospective analysis of 27 cases |journal=Am.

High dose intravenous immune globulin may be effective in controlling hemolysis, but the benefit is short lived (1–4 weeks), and the therapy is very expensive.
