'''[[Corneal transplantation#Boston keratoprosthesis|The Boston Keratoprosthesis (Boston KPro)]]''' is a collar button design [[Keratoprosthesis|keratoprosthesis (KPro)]] or [[Corneal transplantation#Synthetic corneas|artificial cornea]].<ref name="kluufasstarr">Klufas MA , Starr CE. The Boston Keratoprosthesis: An update on recent advances. Cataract and Refractive Surgery Today. September 2009: 9(9).</ref> It is composed of a front plate with a stem, which houses the optical portion of the device, a back plate and a titanium locking c-ring.<ref name="dohlman1">Dohlman C, Harissi-Dagher M. The Boston Keratoprosthesis: A New Threadless Design. Digital Journal of Ophthalmology. 2007;13(3)</ref> It is available in type I and type II formats. The type I design is used much more frequently than the type II which is reserved for severe end stage dry eye conditions and is similar to the type I except it has a 2&nbsp;mm anterior nub designed to penetrate through a tarsorrhaphy. The type I format will be discussed here as it is more commonly used.

The type I Kpro is available in single standard pseudophakic power or customized [[aphakic]] optic with an 8.5&nbsp;mm diameter adult size or 7.0&nbsp;mm diameter pediatric size back plate. The device is currently machined from medical grade [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)]] in [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] in the [[United States]].<ref>Khan B, Dudenhoefer EJ, Dohlman CH. Keratoprosthesis: an update. Curr Opin Ophthalmol. Aug 2001;12(4):282-287</ref> During implantation of the device, the device is assembled with a donor corneal graft positioned between the front and back plate which is then sutured into place in a similar fashion to [[Corneal transplantation|penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplantation)]].<ref>Todani A, Gupta P, Colby K.

==Recent improvements in design==
# The addition of holes in the back plate. The device currently has 16 holes which provides a surface area of 18&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> for diffusion of nutritious aqueous to support the donor graft [[Cornea#Layers|stroma]] and [[Corneal keratocyte|keratocytes]].<ref name="harissi">Harissi-Dagher M, Khan BF, Schaumberg DA, Dohlman CH. Importance of nutrition to corneal grafts when used as a carrier of the Boston Keratoprosthesis. Cornea. Jun 2007;26(5):564-568</ref>
# In 2004, a [[Titanium#Medical|titanium]] locking c-ring was added to prevent intraocular unscrewing of the device.<ref name="dohlman1"/>
# In 2007, a threadless design was introduced which simplified assembly and produced less damage to the donor graft when the device was assembled during the surgical procedure <ref name="harissi"/>

==Indications==
The Boston KPro is a treatment option for corneal disorders not amenable to standard [[Corneal transplantation|penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplantation)]] or corneal transplant. The Boston KPro is a proven primary treatment option for repeat graft failure,<ref>Ma JJ, Graney JM, Dohlman CH. Repeat penetrating keratoplasty versus the Boston keratoprosthesis in graft failure.

==Postoperative management==
# Indefinite placement of a bandage contact lens is needed to maintain adequate ocular surface hydration and prevent stromal melt, dellen formation, tissue melt and necrosis.<ref>Dohlman CH, Dudenhoefer EJ, Khan BF, Morneault S. Protection of the ocular surface after keratoprosthesis surgery: the role of soft contact lenses. Clao J. Apr 2002;28(2):72-74</ref>
# Indefinite daily topical antibiotic prophylaxis.<ref>Durand ML, Dohlman CH. Successful prevention of bacterial endophthalmitis in eyes with the Boston keratoprosthesis. Cornea. Sep 2009;28(8):896-901</ref>
# Lifelong topical steroids.<ref name="exprev">Dohlman CH, Harissi-Dagher M, Khan BF, Sippel K, Aquavella JV, Graney JM. Introduction to the use of the Boston keratoprosthesis. Expert Review of Ophthalmology. 2006;1(1):41-48</ref>
# Close follow-up with an ophthalmologist to monitor for complications associated with the device. Although the surgical procedure is relatively straightforward for surgeons trained to perform corneal transplants, the follow-up required after KPro placement is lifelong.<ref name="exprev"/>

==Postoperative complications==
Most common postoperative complications in order of decreasing prevalence include retroprosthetic membrane (RPM), elevated intraocular pressure/glaucoma, infectious endophthalmitis, sterile vitritis, retina detachment (rare) and vitreous hemorrhage (rare).<ref name="aldave">Aldave AJ, Kamal KM, Vo RC, Yu F.

==Prognosis and outcomes==
4 major studies have been completed to date showing outcomes with the type I Boston KPro:
# Multicenter Boston KPro Study is the largest published to date with 141 Boston type I keratoprosthesis procedures from 17 surgical sites by 39 different surgeons.<ref name="multicenter"/> At an average follow-up of 8.5 months, retention rate of the device was 95%, 57% had BCVA ≥ 20/200. Postoperative complications included RPM in 25%, high [[Intraocular pressure|IOP]] in 15%, sterile vitritis complicated the postoperative course of 5% of eyes. Importantly, no cases of infectious endophthalmitis were reported in this large series.
# A large single surgeon series with 57 modern type I Boston KPro procedures from UCLA medical center.<ref name="aldave"/> At an average follow-up of 17 months, retention rate of the device was 84%, 75% had BCVA ≥ 20/200. Postoperative complications included RPM in 25%, high IOP in 15%, sterile vitritis complicated the postoperative course of 5% of eyes. Postoperative complications included RPM in 44%, high IOP in 18%, sterile vitritis complicated the postoperative course of 10% of eyes. No cases of infectious enophthalmitis were reported in this series.
# A single center study from UC Davis of 30 Boston type I KPro procedures.<ref name="bradley"/> At an average follow-up of 19 months, retention rate of the device was 83%, 77% had BCVA ≥ 20/200. Postoperative complications included RPM in 43%, high IOP in 27%, sterile vitritis complicated the postoperative course of 3% of eyes. The rate of infectious endophthalmitis in this study was 10%.
# A retrospective study of 36 Boston Type I KPro procedures from a single institution.<ref name="chew"/> At an average follow-up of 16 months, retention rate of the device was 100%, 83% had BCVA ≥ 20/200. Postoperative complications included RPM in 65% and high IOP in 38%. Infectious endophthalmitis complicated 11% of eyes during the postoperative period.
