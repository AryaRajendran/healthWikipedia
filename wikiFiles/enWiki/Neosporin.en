'''Neosporin''' (from ''[[wikt:neo|Neo]]'', (Greek) new + ''[[wikt:sporos|Sporos]]'', (Greek) seed) is the product branding and formulas now owned by [[Johnson & Johnson]] of an over-the-counter topical [[antibiotic ointment]] created under [[Warner-Lambert|Warner-Lambert Consumer Healthcare]], now a part of [[Pfizer]].

Neosporin is marketed for the prevention and fighting of [[infection]]s and speeding the healing of [[wound]]s. However, there is little data supporting these claims, and in clinical trials, Neosporin is not more effective than simple [[petroleum jelly]] (see [[Neosporin#Efficacy|Efficacy]], below).

There is also significant concern that use of Neosporin contributes to the emergence of [[antibiotic resistant]] bacteria. In the US, the only large market for Neosporin, the ointment has been shown to be of little use against [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] bacteria and promote bacterial resistance; however such resistance is uncommon. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/14/mrsa-in-u-s-becoming-resistant-to-over-the-counter-ointment/|title=MRSA in U.S. becoming resistant to over the counter ointment|author=Martin, David|date=14 September 2011|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> As well, Neorporin is ineffective against the lethal strain of bacteria, [[ST8:USA300]] strain.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=22000371|year=2011|last1=Suzuki|first1=M|last2=Yamada|first2=K|last3=Nagao|first3=M|last4=Aoki|first4=E|last5=Matsumoto|first5=M|last6=Hirayama|first6=T|last7=Yamamoto|first7=H|last8=Hiramatsu|first8=R|last9=Ichiyama|first9=S|title=Antimicrobial ointments and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA300|volume=17|issue=10|pages=1917–20|doi=10.3201/eid1710.101365|pmc=3310646|journal=Emerging infectious diseases}}</ref>

==Components==

The original ointment contains three different antibiotics: [[bacitracin]], [[neomycin]], and [[polymyxin B]], in a relatively low molecular weight patented base of cocoa butter, cottonseed oil, sodium pyruvate, tocopheryl acetate, and [[petroleum jelly]].

The generic name for these products, regardless of the base, is "Triple Antibiotic Ointment".
In China, this product is called "Complex Polymyxin B Ointment," which is manufactured by Zhejiang Reachall Pharmaceutical. The product was also marketed by The [[Upjohn]] Company under the name "Mycitracin", until 1997 when that name was acquired by Johnson & Johnson.<ref>{{Cite news

Some people have allergic reactions to [[neomycin]], so a "Double antibiotic ointment" is sold that only contains 
[[bacitracin]] and [[polymyxin B]], such as the co-brand [[Polysporin]].

A "Plus" variant of the ointment exists that adds the [[analgesic]] [[pramoxine]], but uses the cheap, simple, long-lasting, but heavier [[petroleum jelly]] base that is common to many OTC topicals.  The latest version of this, a high-absorption [[cream (pharmaceutical)|cream]], removes the [[bacitracin]] which is unstable in such a base, but keeps the analgesic.

== Efficacy ==

Despite numerous trials, there is little data that Neosporin provides any benefit to users. As compared to covering a small wound with simple [[petroleum jelly]], Neosporin does not provide any benefit,<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=21247662|year=2011|last1=Draelos|first1=ZD|last2=Rizer|first2=RL|last3=Trookman|first3=NS|title=A comparison of postprocedural wound care treatments: Do antibiotic-based ointments improve outcomes?|volume=64|issue=3 Suppl|pages=S23–9|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.11.010|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology}}</ref> but commonly causes [[contact dermatitis]]<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18674453|year=2008|last1=Sheth|first1=VM|last2=Weitzul|first2=S|title=Postoperative topical antimicrobial use|volume=19|issue=4|pages=181–9|journal=Dermatitis : contact, atopic, occupational, drug : official journal of the American Contact Dermatitis Society, North American Contact Dermatitis Group}}</ref>

The high incidence of [[contact dermatitis]] associated with Neosporin has earned it the [[Allergen of the Year]] award.
