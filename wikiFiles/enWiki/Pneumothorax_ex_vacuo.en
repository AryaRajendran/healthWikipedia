'''Pneumothorax ex vacuo''' is a rare type of [[pneumothorax]] which forms adjacent to an [[atelectasis|atelectatic lobe]].<ref name="pmid16087092">{{cite journal| author=Ponrartana S, Laberge JM, Kerlan RK, Wilson MW, Gordon RL| title=Management of patients with "ex vacuo" pneumothorax after thoracentesis. | journal=Acad Radiol | year= 2005 | volume= 12 | issue= 8 | pages= 980–6 | pmid=16087092 | doi=10.1016/j.acra.2005.04.013 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=16087092  }} </ref> It is seen preferentially with atelectasis of the right upper lobe and is the result of rapid atelectasis producing an abrupt decrease in the intrapleural pressure with subsequent release of [[nitrogen]] from pleural [[capillaries]].

== Treatment ==
Treatment consists of [[bronchoscopy]] rather than chest tube drainage. [[X-Ray|Radiographically]], pneumothorax ex vacuo is suggested when an atelectatic lobe or lung, particularly right upper lobe atelectasis, is surrounded by a focal pneumothorax.<ref name="pmid21326535">{{cite journal| author=Staes W, Funaki B| title="Ex vacuo" pneumothorax. | journal=Semin Intervent Radiol | year= 2009 | volume= 26 | issue= 1 | pages= 82–5 | pmid=21326535 | doi=10.1055/s-0029-1208386 | pmc=3036450 | url= }} </ref>

== Related illness ==
"Trapped lung" presents in the same way as pneumothorax ex vacuo and can occur in patients with visceral pleural thickening and following drainage of an effusion.
