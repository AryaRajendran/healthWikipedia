<!--This article is in US English-->
[[Tuberculosis]] is diagnosed by finding ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' bacteria in a clinical specimen taken from the patient.  While other investigations may strongly suggest tuberculosis as the diagnosis, they cannot confirm it.

A complete medical evaluation for [[tuberculosis]] (TB) must include a medical history, a physical examination, a [[chest X-ray]] and microbiological examination (of sputum or some other appropriate sample).  It may also include a [[tuberculin skin test]], other scans and X-rays, surgical biopsy.

==Medical history==
The medical history includes obtaining the symptoms of pulmonary TB:  [[sputum|productive]], prolonged cough of three or more weeks, chest pain, and [[hemoptysis]]. Systemic symptoms include low grade remittent fever, chills, night sweats, appetite loss, weight loss, easy fatiguability, and production of sputum that starts out mucoid but changes to [[purulent]].<ref name=Robbins>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; & Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 516-522 ISBN 978-1-4160-2973-1</ref>  Other parts of the medical history include prior TB exposure, infection or disease; past TB treatment; demographic risk factors for TB; and medical conditions that increase risk for TB disease such as HIV infection. Depending on the sort of patient population surveyed, as few as 20%, or as many as 75% of pulmonary tuberculosis cases may be without symptoms.<ref>Burke and Parnell. Minimal Pulmonary Tuberculosis. 1948.  59:348  Canadian Medical Association Journal.</ref>

Tuberculosis should be suspected when a pneumonia-like illness has persisted longer than three weeks, or when a respiratory illness in an otherwise healthy individual does not respond to regular antibiotics.

==Physical examination==
A [[physical examination]] is done to assess the patient's general health and find other factors which may affect the TB treatment plan.  It cannot be used to confirm or rule out TB. However, certain findings are suggestive of TB. For example, blood in the sputum, significant weight loss and drenching night sweats may be due to TB.

==Microbiological studies==
[[Image:TB Culture.jpg|thumb|Distinctive clusters of colorless ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' form in this culture.]] 
A definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis can only be made by culturing ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' organisms from a specimen taken from the patient (most often [[sputum]], but may also include pus, [[Cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]], biopsied tissue, etc.).<ref name=Robbins/>  A diagnosis made other than by culture may only be classified as "probable" or "presumed".  For a diagnosis negating the possibility of tuberculosis infection, most protocols require that two separate cultures both test negative.<ref name=Robbins/>

===Sputum===
Sputum smears and [[microbiological culture|cultures]] should be done for acid-fast bacilli if the patient is producing sputum.<ref name=Robbins/>  The preferred method for this is [[fluorescence microscopy]] ([[auramine-rhodamine stain]]ing), which is more sensitive than conventional [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]]ing.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Steingart K, Henry M, Ng V, ''et al.'' | title=Fluorescence versus conventional sputum smear microscopy for tuberculosis: a systematic review | journal=Lancet Infect Dis | year=2006 | volume=6 | issue=9 | pages=570&ndash;81 | doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70578-3 | pmid=16931408}}</ref> In cases where there is no spontaneous sputum production, a sample can be induced, usually by nebulized inhalation of a saline or saline with bronchodilator solution. A comparative study found that inducing three sputum samples is more [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] than three gastric washings.<ref name="pmid17479935">{{cite journal |author=Brown M, Varia H, Bassett P, Davidson RN, Wall R, Pasvol G |title=Prospective study of sputum induction, gastric washing, and bronchoalveolar lavage for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients who are unable to expectorate |journal=Clin Infect Dis|volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=1415–20 |year=2007 |pmid=17479935 |doi=10.1086/516782}}</ref>

===Alternative sampling===
In patients incapable of producing a sputum sample, common alternative sample sources for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis include [[gastric washing]]s, [[Larynx|laryngeal]] swab, [[bronchoscopy]] (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washings, and/or transbronchial [[biopsy]]), and [[fine needle aspiration]] (transtracheal or transbronchial). In some cases, a more invasive technique is necessary, including tissue biopsy during [[mediastinoscopy]] or [[thoracoscopy]].

===PCR===
Other mycobacteria are also acid-fast. If the smear is positive, [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] or gene probe tests can distinguish ''M. tuberculosis'' from other mycobacteria. Even if sputum smear is negative, tuberculosis must be considered and is only excluded after negative cultures.

===Other===
Many types of cultures are available.<REF NAME="pmid12614730"/> Traditionally, cultures have used the [[Lowenstein–Jensen medium|Löwenstein-Jensen]] (LJ), Kirchner, or Middlebrook media (7H9, 7H10, and 7H11). A culture of the AFB can distinguish the various forms of mycobacteria, although results from this may take four to eight weeks for a conclusive answer. New automated systems that are faster include the MB/BacT, BACTEC 9000, VersaTREK, and the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT).  The [[Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility assay]] culture may be a faster and more accurate method.<REF NAME="pmid17035648">{{cite journal |author=Moore D, Evans C, Gilman R, Caviedes L, Coronel J, Vivar A, Sanchez E, Piñedo Y, Saravia J, Salazar C, Oberhelman R, Hollm-Delgado M, LaChira D, Escombe A, Friedland J |title=Microscopic-observation drug-susceptibility assay for the diagnosis of TB |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=355 |issue=15 |pages=1539–50 |year=2006 |pmid=17035648 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa055524 |pmc=1780278}}</ref>

==Radiography==
{{Main|Tuberculosis radiology}}

===Chest X-ray and CT===
[[Image:TB CXR.jpg|thumb|Tuberculosis creates cavities visible in [[x-ray]]s like this one in the patient's right upper lobe.]]
In active pulmonary TB, infiltrates or consolidations and/or cavities are often seen in the upper [[human lung|lung]]s with or without mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy or pleural effusions ( tuberculous pleurisy). However, lesions may appear anywhere in the lungs. In disseminated TB a pattern of many tiny nodules throughout the lung fields is common - the so-called miliary TB. In HIV and other [[immune suppression|immunosuppress]]ed persons, any abnormality may indicate TB or the chest X-ray may even appear entirely normal.

Abnormalities on chest radiographs may be suggestive of, but are not necessarily diagnostic of, TB. However, chest radiographs may be used to rule out the possibility of pulmonary TB in a person who has a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test and no symptoms of the disease.

Cavitation or consolidation of the apexes of the upper lobes of the lung or the [[tree-in-bud sign]]<ref name="Rossi 789–801">{{cite journal|last=Rossi|first=S. E.|coauthors=Franquet, T.; Volpacchio, M.; Gimenez, A.; Aguilar, G.|title=Tree-in-Bud Pattern at Thin-Section CT of the Lungs: Radiologic-Pathologic Overview|journal=Radiographics|date=1 May 2005|volume=25|issue=3|pages=789–801|doi=10.1148/rg.253045115|url=http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/25/3/789.full|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>  may be visible on an affected patient's chest X-ray.<ref name=Robbins/>
The [[tree-in-bud sign]] may appear on the chest CTs of some patients affected by tuberculosis, but it is not specific to tuberculosis.<ref name="Rossi 789–801"/>

===Abreugraphy===
{{details|Abreugraphy}}

A variant of the chest X-Ray, [[abreugraphy]] (from the name of its inventor, Dr. [[Manuel Dias de Abreu]]) was a small radiographic image, also called miniature mass radiography (MMR) or miniature chest radiograph. Though its resolution is limited (it doesn't allow the diagnosis of [[lung cancer]], for example) it is sufficiently accurate for diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Much less expensive than traditional X-Ray, MMR was quickly adopted and extensively utilized in some countries, in the 1950s. For example, in [[Brazil]] and in [[Japan]], tuberculosis prevention laws went into effect, obligating ca. 60% of the population to undergo MMR screening.

The procedure went out of favor, as the incidence of tuberculosis dramatically decreased, but is still used in certain situations, such as the screening of [[prison]]ers and [[immigration]] applicants..

==Immunological test==

===ALS Assay===
{{for|an overview of ALS Assay|Antibodies_from_Lymphocyte_Secretions}}
Antibodies from Lymphocyte Secretion or Antibody in Lymphocyte Supernatant or ALS Assay is an immunological assay to detect active diseases like tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid etc. Recently, ALS assay nods the scientific community as it is rapidly used for diagnosis of tuberculosis. The principle is based on the secretion of antibody from in vivo activated plasma B cells found in blood circulation for a short period of time in response to TB-antigens during active TB infection rather than latent TB infection.

===Tuberculin skin test===
{{details|Tuberculin skin test}}

Two tests are available: the Mantoux and Heaf tests.

===Mantoux skin test===
{{details|Mantoux test}}
[[Image:Mantoux tuberculin skin test.jpg|thumb|Injecting a Mantoux skin test]]
[[Image:Mantoux test.jpg|thumb|The [[Mantoux test]] for TB involves intradermally injecting PPD (Purified Protein Derivative) tuberculin and measuring the size of induration 48-72 hours later.]]

The Mantoux skin test is used in the United States and is endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ([[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]). 

If a person has had a history of a positive tuberculin skin test, another skin test is not needed.

===Heaf test===
{{details|Heaf test}}
The [[Heaf test]] was used in the United Kingdom until 2005, and is graded on a four point scale. The [[Mantoux test]] is now used.

The equivalent Mantoux test positive levels done with 10 TU (0.1 ml 100 TU/ml, 1:1000) are
*0&ndash;4&nbsp;mm induration (Heaf 0 to 1)
*5&ndash;14&nbsp;mm induration (Heaf 2)
*Greater than 15&nbsp;mm induration (Heaf 3 to 5)

===CDC classification of tuberculin reaction===
An induration (palpable raised hardened area of skin) of more than 5–15&nbsp;mm (depending upon the person's risk factors) to 10 Mantoux units is considered a positive result, indicating TB infection.

*5&nbsp;mm or more is positive in
**HIV-positive person
**Recent contacts of TB case
**Persons with nodular or fibrotic changes on CXR consistent with old healed TB
**Patients with organ transplants and other immunosuppressed patients

*10&nbsp;mm or more is positive in
**Recent arrivals (less than 5 years) from high-prevalent countries
**Injection drug users
**Residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings (e.g., prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, homeless shelters, etc.)
**Mycobacteriology lab personnel
**Persons with clinical conditions that place them at high risk (e.g., [[diabetes]], prolonged [[corticosteroid]] therapy, [[leukemia]], [[renal failure|end-stage renal disease]], chronic [[malabsorption]] syndromes, low body weight, etc.)
**Children less than 4 years of age, or children and adolescents exposed to adults in high-risk categories

*15&nbsp;mm or more is positive in
**Persons with no known risk factors for TB
**(Note: Targeted skin testing programs should only be conducted among high-risk groups)

A tuberculin test conversion is defined as an increase of 10&nbsp;mm or more within a 2-year period, regardless of age.

===BCG vaccine and tuberculin skin test===

There is disagreement on the use of the Mantoux test on people who have been immunized with BCG.  The US recommendation is that in administering and interpreting the Mantoux test, previous BCG vaccination should be ignored; the UK recommendation is that [[interferon-γ release assays|interferon-γ tests]] should be used to help interpret positive tuberculin tests, also, the UK does not recommend serial tuberculin skin testing in people who have had BCG (a key part of the US strategy).  In their guidelines on the use of [[QuantiFERON Gold]] the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that whereas Quantiferon Gold is not affected by BCG inoculation tuberculin tests can be affected.<ref>CDC - [http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5415a4.htm Guidelines for Using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test for Detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection, United States]</ref>  In general the US approach is likely to result in more false positives and more unnecessary treatment with potentially toxic drugs; the UK approach is as sensitive in theory and should also be more specific, because of the use of interferon-γ tests.

Under the US recommendations, diagnosis and treatment of [[latent tuberculosis]] infection (LTBI) is considered for any BCG-vaccinated person whose skin test is 10&nbsp;mm or greater, if any of these circumstances are present:
*Was in contact with another person with infectious TB
*Was born or has resided in a high TB prevalence country
*Is continually exposed to populations where TB prevalence is high.

===Adenosine deaminase===
In 2007, a systematic review of [[adenosine deaminase]] by the [[National Health Service|NHS]] Health Technology Assessment Programme concluded "There is no evidence to support the use of ADA tests for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. However, there is considerable evidence to support their use in pleural fluid samples for  diagnosis of pleural TB, where sensitivity was very high, and to a slightly lesser extent for TB meningitis. In both pleural TB and TB meningitis, ADA tests had higher sensitivity than any other tests."<ref name="pmid17266837"/>

===Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT)===
This is a heterogeneous group of tests that use either the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique or [[Transcription mediated amplification]] (TMA) or other forms of nucleic acid amplification methods to detect mycobacterial nucleic acid.  These test vary in which nucleic acid sequence they detect and vary in their accuracy.  The two most common commercially available tests are the amplified mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test (MTD, Gen-Probe) and Amplicor (Roche Diagnostics).  In 2007, a systematic review of NAAT by the [[National Health Service|NHS]] Health Technology Assessment Programme concluded that "NAAT test accuracy to be far superior when applied to respiratory samples as opposed to other specimens.  Although the results were not statistically significant, the AMTD test appears to perform better than other currently available commercial tests."<ref name="pmid17266837"/>

In a more recent before-after [[observational study]], found that use of the MTD test reduce inappropriate tuberculosis therapy. The study found the accuracy of the MTD test as follows:<ref name="pmid17573496">{{cite journal |author=Guerra RL, Hooper NM, Baker JF, ''et al.'' |title=Use of the Amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis Direct Test in a Public Health Laboratory: Test Performance and Impact on Clinical Care |journal=Chest |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=946–51 |year=2007 |pmid=17573496 |doi=10.1378/chest.06-2959}}</ref>

Overall
* [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] 92%
* [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] 99%

Smear positive patients
* sensitivity 99%
* specificity 98%

Smear negative patients
* sensitivity 62%
* specificity 99%

===Full blood count===
Although a [[full blood count]] is never diagnostic, [[anemia|normocytic anemia]] and [[lymphopenia]] are common. [[Neutrophilia]] is rarely found 
[iron deficiency anemia may develop with isoniazid treatment].
[[Urea]] and [[electrolyte]]s are usually normal, although [[hypocalcemia]] and [[hyponatremia]] are possible in tuberculous meningoencephalitis due to [[Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone|SIADH]]. In advanced disease, [[hypoalbuminemia]], [[hyperproteinemia]], and [[hyperglobulinemia]] may be present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/content/abstract/20/1/1|title=Tibione in the Treatment of Tuberculosis Activity, Dosage and Toxic Manifestations}}</ref>

[[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] is usually raised.

==Interferon-γ release assays==
Interferon-γ (interferon-gamma) release assays (IGRAs) are new developments in TB infection testing.  IGRAs are based on the ability of the ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' [[antigen]]s for early secretory antigen target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) to stimulate host production of interferon-gamma. Because these antigens are not present in non-tuberculous mycobacteria or in any BCG vaccine variant, these tests can distinguish latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).

The blood tests [[QuantiFERON#QuantiFERON-TB_Gold_In-Tube|QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube]] and [[T-SPOT.TB]] use these antigens to detect people with tuberculosis. [[Lymphocyte]]s from the patient's blood are incubated with the antigens.  These tests are called [[interferon γ test]]s and are not equivalent.<ref name="Ferrara2006">{{cite journal | author=Ferrara G ''et al.'' | title=Use in routine clinical practice of two commercial blood tests for diagnosis of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a prospective study | journal=Lancet | volume=367 | issue=9519 | pages=1328&ndash;1334 | pmid=16631911 | url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606685796/abstract | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68579-6 | year=2006 | format=abstract }}</ref>  If the patient has been exposed to tuberculosis before, [[T cell|T lymphocytes]] produce [[interferon]] γ in response.  The [[QuantiFERON#QuantiFERON-TB_Gold_In-Tube|QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube]] uses an [[ELISA]] format to detect the whole blood production of interferon γ with great sensitivity (89%).{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  The distinction between the tests is that QuantiFERON-TB Gold quantifies the total amount of interferon γ when whole blood is exposed to the antigens(ESAT-6,CFP-10 and TB 7.7(p4)), whereas    [http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5415a4.htm Guidelines] for the use of the FDA approved QuantiFERON-TB Gold were released by the CDC in December 2005. In October 2007, the FDA gave approval of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube for use in the United States.
 
The enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) is another blood test available in the UK that may replace the skin test for diagnosis.<ref name="pmid11438135">{{cite journal |author=Lalvani A, Pathan A, Durkan H, Wilkinson K, Whelan A, Deeks J, Reece W, Latif M, Pasvol G, Hill A |title=Enhanced contact tracing and spatial tracking of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection by enumeration of antigen-specific T cells |journal=Lancet |volume=357 |issue=9273 |pages=2017–21 |year=2001 |pmid=11438135 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)05115-1}}</ref><REF NAME="pmid14586040">{{cite journal |author=Lalvani A |title=Spotting latent infection: the path to better tuberculosis control |journal=Thorax |volume=58 |issue=11 |pages=916–8 |year=2003 |pmid=14586040 |doi=10.1136/thorax.58.11.916 |pmc=1746498}}</ref><REF NAME="pmid12686038">{{cite journal |author=Ewer K, Deeks J, Alvarez L, Bryant G, Waller S, Andersen P, Monk P, Lalvani A |title=Comparison of T-cell-based assay with tuberculin skin test for diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in a school tuberculosis outbreak |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9364 |pages=1168–73 |year=2003 |pmid=12686038 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12950-9}}</ref> [[T-SPOT.TB]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tspot.com/about-the-test/t-spot-tb-test-works/|title=The Science behind T-SPOT.''TB'' Technology}}</ref> a type of [[ELISPOT]] assay,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordimmunotec.com/products_services/howtbworks.html|title=How T-SPOT.TB Works}}</ref> counts the number of activated T lymphocytes that secrete interferon γ.

==Tuberculosis classification system used in the US==
{{details|Tuberculosis classification}}
The current clinical classification system for TB (Class 0 to 5) is based on the pathogenesis of the disease.  

The [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] has an additional TB classification (Class A, B1, or B2) for [[immigrant]]s and [[refugee]]s developed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).  The (Class) ''B notification program'' is an important screening strategy to identify new arrivals who have a high risk for TB.
