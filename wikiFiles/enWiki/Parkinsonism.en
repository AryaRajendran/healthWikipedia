'''Parkinsonism''' (also known as '''Parkinson's syndrome''', '''atypical Parkinson's''', or '''secondary Parkinson's''') is a neurological [[syndrome]] (not the specific disease) characterized by [[tremor]], [[hypokinesia]], [[Rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]], and [[balance disorder|postural instability]].<ref name=Aminoff_2005>{{cite book | author = Aminoff MJ, Greenberg DA, Simon RP | title = Clinical Neurology | publisher = Lange: McGraw-Hill Medical | edition = 6th | pages = 241–5 |year = 2005 | isbn = 0-07-142360-5 }}</ref> The underlying causes of parkinsonism are numerous, and diagnosis can be complex.<ref>Rao G, Fisch L, Srinivasan S, et al.

The age of the person presenting with parkinsonism is significant.  A 20 year old person might present with Parkinsonism. Younger patients should be checked for the many causes of parkinsonism listed in the differential etiology below, including [[Wilson disease]] and not immediately be given the diagnosis of Parkinson "disease".<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1153622-overview</ref>  However, Juvenile Parkinson disease can cause parkinsonism in a child or young adult. In contrast a 60 year old person might present with Parkinsonism, at first be diagnosed with Parkinson Disease, then determined to have a [[Parkinson plus syndrome]].<ref>http://www.emedicinehealth.com/parkinson_disease/article_em.htm#parkinsons_disease_definition_and_overview</ref>

About 7% of people with parkinsonism have developed their symptoms following treatment with particular medications. Side effect of medications, mainly neuroleptic antipsychotics especially the [[phenothiazine]]s (such as perphenazine and [[chlorpromazine]]), [[thioxanthene]]s (such as flupenthixol and zuclopenthixol) and [[butyrophenone]]s (such as haloperidol (Haldol)), [[piperazine]]s (such as ziprasidone), and, rarely, antidepressants. The incidence of drug-induced parkinsonism increases with age. Drug induced parkinsonism tends to remain at it's presenting level, i.e. does not progress like the parkinson disease.<ref> http://www.parkinsons.org.uk/PDF/FS38_druginducedparkinsonism.pdf</ref> 

==Etiology==
Before Parkinson's disease is diagnosed the [[differential diagnosis]] or list of potential causes for Parkinson'''ism''' must be investigated and includes:
* [[AIDS]] can sometimes lead to the symptoms of secondary parkinsonism, due to commonly causing dopaminergic dysfunction. Indeed Parkinsonism can be a presenting feature of HIV infection.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tse W | title = Movement disorders and AIDS: a review | journal = Parkinsonism Relat.
