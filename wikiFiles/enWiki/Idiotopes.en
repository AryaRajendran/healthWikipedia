An '''idiotope''' is the unique set of [[antigenic determinants]] (epitopes) of the variable portion of an [[antibody]].<ref name="titleDorlands Medical Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzdmd_i_01zPzhtm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary |accessdate=2008-03-23 |format= |work=}}</ref> In some cases it can be the actual antigen-binding site, and in some cases it may comprise variable region sequences outside of the antigen-binding site on the antibody itself. Thus each antibody would have multiple idiotopes; and the set of these individual idiotopes is termed the idiotype of the antibody. 

Idiotopes contrast with [[allotope]]s, which are non-varying structures on the [[Fc receptor]].<ref name="titleDorlands Medical Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzdmd_a_25zPzhtm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary |accessdate=2008-03-23 |format= |work=}}</ref>

If a separate antibody is produced that has specific binding capabilities to an idiotope of the previously described antibody, it is said to be an "anti-idiotypic antibody".  If such is the case, the anti-idiotypic antibodies will be able to bind to the [[B lymphocyte]] receptor for the original antigen and inhibit the [[immune response]] to that antigen.  

This type of regulation was proposed by [[Niels Jerne]] in 1974. He termed it the "Network Hypothesis".  This type of B lymphocyte regulation may be partially responsible for preventing an immune response from getting out of control, which would elicit damage to host [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] or even cause an [[autoimmune disease]]d state.

Because of the resemblance of anti-idiotypic antibodies to the original antigen, [[vaccine]] studies have been performed.  These types of vaccines are called "idiotypic vaccines".  None are produced commercially to date.
