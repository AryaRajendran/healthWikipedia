'''Mitral valve annuloplasty''' is a surgical technique for the repair of leaking [[mitral valves]]. Due to various factors, the two leaflets normally involved in sealing the mitral valve to retrograde flow may not coapt properly. Surgical repair typically involves the implantation of a device surrounding the mitral valve, called an annuloplasty device, which pulls the leaflets together to facilitate coaptation and aids to re-establish mitral valve function.

== Need ==
[[Mitral regurgitation]] is the most common form of mitral valve dysfunction. Today more than 2.5 million Americans are estimated to be affected by mitral regurgitation. This number is expected to double by the year 2030. Every year, 300,000 people worldwide undergo open heart surgery for [[mitral valve repair]], 44,000 people in the US alone.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bonow|first=R.O.|coauthors=et al.|title=ACC/AHA 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease|journal=Circulation|year=2006|volume=114|pages=e84-e231|pmid=16880336|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.176857|issue=5}}</ref>

== Relevance ==
Since it was initially established 40 years ago by Professor [[Alain Carpentier]], mitral valve annuloplasty has been continuously improved and is considered the gold standard for the treatment of most etiologies of mitral valve dysfunction today.<ref>{{cite journal|last=de Oliveira|first=J.M.F|coauthors=Antunes, M.J|title=Mitral valve repair: better than replacement|journal=Heart|year=2006|volume=92|pages=275–281|doi=10.1136/hrt.2005.076208|pmid=16415204|issue=2|pmc=1860778}}</ref>

== Rationale ==
The goal of mitral valve annuloplasty is to regain mitral valve competence by restoring the physiological form and function of the normal mitral valve apparatus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carpentier|first=A.F.|title=Carpentier’s Reconstructive Valve Surgery|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier Saunders}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Rausch|first=M.K.|coauthors=Bothe W., Kvitting J.P., Swanson J.C., Miller D.C., Kuhl E.|title=Mitral valve annuloplasty - A quantitative clinical and mechanical comparison of different annuloplasty devices|journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering|year=2011|doi=10.1007/s10439-011-0442-y|pmid=22037916|volume=40|issue=3|pages=750–61|pmc=3288426}}</ref> Under normal conditions the mitral valve undergoes significant dynamic changes in shape and size throughout the [[cardiac cycle]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ormiston|first=J.A.|coauthors=Shah, P.M., Tei, C., Wong, M|title=Size and motion of the mitral valve annulus in man.

Throughout the cardiac cycle, the annulus undergoes a sphincter motion, narrowing down the orifice area during [[systole]] to facilitate coaptation of the two leaflets and widens during [[diastole]] to allow for easy diastolic filling of the left ventricle. This motion is further enhanced by a pronounced three-dimensional configuration during systole, the characteristic saddle shape.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jimenez|first=J.H.|coauthors=Soerensen, D.D., He, Z., He, S., Yoganathan, A.P|title=Eﬀects of a saddle shaped annulus on mitral valve function and chordal force distribution: an in vitro study|journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering|year=2003|volume=31|pages=1171–1181|doi=10.1114/1.1616929|pmid=14649491|issue=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=R.A.|coauthors=Handschumacher, M.D., Sanﬁlippo, A.J., Hagege, A.A., Harrigan, P., Marshall, J.E., Weyman, A.E|title=Three-dimensional echocardiographic reconstruction of the mitral valve, with implications for the diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse|journal=Circulation|year=1980|volume=89|pages=589–598}}</ref> These changes throughout the cycle are believed to be key to optimize leaflet coaptation <ref>{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=M.O.|coauthors=Jensen, H., Smerup, M., Levine, R.A., Yoganathan, A.P., Nygaard, H., Hasenkam, J.M., Nielsen, S.L.|title=Saddle-shaped mitral valve annuloplasty rings experience lower forces compared with ﬂat rings|journal=Circulation|year=2008|volume=118|pages=250–255}}</ref> and to minimize tissue stresses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Padala|first=M|coauthors=Hutchison, R.A., Croft, L.R., Jimenez, J.H., Gorman, R.C., Gorman, J.H., Sacks, M.S., Yoganathan, A.P.|title=Saddle shape of the mitral annulus reduces systolic strains on the P2 segment of the posterior mitral leaﬂet|journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery|year=2009|volume=88|pages=1499–1504|doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.06.042|pmid=19853100|issue=5|pmc=3021783}}</ref>

== Sizing ==
Annuloplasty devices usually come in different sizes. The surgeon can estimate the dimensions of the patient’s mitral valve and decide on an appropriate ring size. Depending on the disease etiology different approaches are taken. Surgeons can decide to “undersize” the device, “truesize” the device, or “oversize”.

== Device classification and regulatory considerations ==
Annuloplasty devices are classified by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as [[Medical_device#Class_II:_General_controls_with_special_controls|class II]] medical device. According to the FDA following issues need to be addressed before annuloplasty rings can be approved for marketing:<ref>{{cite web|title=Guidance for Annuloplasty Rings 510(k) Submissions; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm073648.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref>

== Minimally invasive annuloplasty ==

New technologies that allow for [[minimally invasive surgery]] have also begun to change mitral valve surgery. A number of devices and techniques have been developed that do not necessitate [[open-heart surgery]] for the repair of the mitral valve.  Following is a list of minimally invasive annuloplasty devices or related:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mack|first=M.J.|title=New techniques for [[percutaneous]] repair of the mitral valve|journal=Heart Failure Review|year=2006|volume=11|pages=259–268}}</ref>
