'''''Capillaria philippinensis''''' is a [[parasite|parasitic]] [[nematode]] which causes '''intestinal [[capillariasis]]'''.  This sometimes fatal disease was first discovered in Northern [[Luzon]], [[Philippines]] in 1964.  Cases have also been reported from China, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Korea, Lao PDR, Taiwan and Thailand.  Cases diagnosed in Italy and Spain were believed to be acquired abroad, with one case possibly contracted in Colombia.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8286640 |year=1993 |author1=Dronda |first2=F |first3=A |first4=R |title=Human intestinal capillariasis in an area of nonendemicity: case report and review |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=909–12 |journal=Clinical infectious diseases |last2=Chaves |last3=Sanz |last4=Lopez-Velez |doi=10.1093/clinids/17.5.909}}</ref> The natural life cycle of ''C. philippinensis'' is believed to involve fish as [[parasitic life cycles|intermediate hosts]], and fish-eating birds as definitive hosts.  Humans acquire ''C. philippinensis'' by eating small species of infested fish whole and raw.

==Discovery and nomenclature==
[[Image:CapillariaPhilippEgg.jpg|left|thumb|''Capillaria philippinensis'' egg.]]
Between the first case reported in 1964 and the end of 1967, more than 1000 cases were documented in and around Northern Luzon, including 77 deaths.  [[Witch doctor]]s were hired by the locals to [[exorcise]] the curse placed on them by the river god, which they believed was responsible for this sudden disaster.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1576584 |url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/5/2/120 |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |title=Intestinal capillariasis |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=120 |author=Cross, J H |year=1992 |pmc=358231}}</ref>

In 1968, the cause was identified as ''Capillaria philippinensis''.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=5647122 |year=1968 |author1=Chitwood |first2=C |first3=NG |title=''Capillaria philippinensis'' sp. n. (Nematoda: Trichinellida), from the intestine of man in the Philippines |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=368–71 |journal=Journal of Parasitology |doi=10.2307/3276953 |last2=Valesquez |last3=Salazar |jstor=3276953}}</ref>  Adult ''C. philippinensis'' are very small, with males measuring 1.5-3.9&nbsp;mm long and 23-28&nbsp;µm maximum width, while adult females are 2.3-5.3&nbsp;mm long and 29-47&nbsp;µm maximum width.  Eggs measure 36-45&nbsp;µm long and 20&nbsp;µm wide, and are described as peanut-shaped with a striated shell.

This species has been transferred to the genus ''Aonchotheca'', as ''Aonchotheca philippinensis'',<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7106653 |year=1982 |author1=Moravec |title=Proposal of a new systematic arrangement of nematodes of the family Capillariidae |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=119–32 |journal=Folia parasitologica}}</ref> and to the genus ''Paracapillaria'', as ''Paracapillaria philippinensis''.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11227884 |year=2001 |author1=Moravec |title=Redescription and systematic status of ''Capillaria philippinensis'', an intestinal parasite of human beings |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=161–4 |journal=Journal of Parasitology |doi=10.2307/3285194 |jstor=3285194}}</ref> However, this species is almost universally referred to as ''Capillaria philippinensis'' in the current medical literature.

==Hosts and life cycle==
[[Image:CapillariaPhilippLifeCycle.gif|right|thumb|''Capillaria philippinensis'' life cycle.]]

The complete life cycle of ''C. philippinensis'' has been demonstrated in experimental studies, and may be either indirect (involving an intermediate host) or direct (complete in one host).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3748/wjg.14.506 |pmid=18203280 |year=2008 |author1=Saichua |first2=C |first3=N |title=Human intestinal capillariasis in Thailand |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=506–10 |pmc=2681139 |journal=World journal of gastroenterology |last2=Nithikathkul |last3=Kaewpitoon}}</ref>

'''Indirect life cycle.'''  Fish-eating birds which harbor adult ''C. philippinensis'' in their [[intestine]]s, shed embryonated eggs in their feces.  When these eggs are fed to uninfected fish, ''C. philippinensis'' larvae are recovered from the intestines of fish.  If the fish are fed to uninfested birds, the larvae develop into adults in the intestinal tract of the birds.  Larvae recovered from the fish also developed into adults when fed to [[gerbil]]s or [[monkey]]s, with eggs shed in the feces of these [[mammal]]ian hosts.  Naturally infested fish (''Hypseleotris bipartita'' and ''Apagon'' sp.) and birds (''[[Ixobrychus]]'' sp.) have also been found.  Humans become infested when they eat raw or undercooked fish, probably small fish eaten whole, which have the infective larvae in their intestinal tract.  Raw fish are commonly eaten by several of the Asian cultures in which ''C. philippinensis'' infestations have been found.

While the natural host range is not known, experimental infestations of several fishes, including ''[[Cyprinus carpio]]'', ''Puntius gonionotus'', ''[[Blackline rasbora|Rasbora borapetensis]]'', ''[[Broadhead sleeper|Eleotris melanosoma]]'', ''[[Ambassis]] commersoni'' and ''Apagon'' sp., with ''C. philippinensis'' eggs yielded infective larvae.  Experimental infestations of several birds, including ''[[White-breasted Waterhen|Amaurornis phoenicurus]]'', ''[[Chinese Pond Heron|Ardeola bacchus]]'', ''[[Black-crowned Night Heron|Nycticorax nycticorax]]'', ''[[Cattle Egret|Bubulcus ibis]]'', ''[[Yellow Bittern|Ixobrychus sinensis]]'', ''[[Common Moorhen|Gallinula chloropus]]'', and ''[[Greater Painted Snipe|Rostratula benghalensis]]'', with larvae yielded mature adults.

'''Direct life cycle.''' Researchers also found that feeding just a few dozen larvae from the intestines of fish to Mongolian gerbils (''[[Meriones unguiculatus]]'') or monkeys (''[[Macaque|Macaca]]'' sp.) led to infestations with thousands of adult worms through "[[autoinfection]]."  Autoinfection is when the offspring produced by adults can reinfest the same host, allowing the infestation to multiply within a single host animal.  Both [[oviparity|oviparous]] (egg-laying) and larviparous (giving birth to active larvae) adult female ''C. philippinensis'' were found in Mongolian gerbils and some birds. The experimentally infested monkeys never developed any clinical symptoms, even during prolonged, active infestations. Of several rodents tested, only Mongolian gerbils developed severe symptoms due to infestation and died.
