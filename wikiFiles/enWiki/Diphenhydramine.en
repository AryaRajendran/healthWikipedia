'''Diphenhydramine''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|d|aɪ|f|ɛ|n|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|r|ə|m|iː|n}}; abbreviated '''DPH''', sometimes '''DHM''') is a [[H1 antagonist#First-generation (non-selective, classical)|first-generation]] [[antihistamine]] possessing [[anticholinergic]], [[antitussive]], [[antiemetic]], and [[sedative]] properties that is mainly used to treat [[allergies]]. It is also used in the management of drug-induced [[parkinsonism]] and other [[extrapyramidal symptoms]]. The drug has a strong [[hypnotic]] effect and is FDA-approved as a non-prescription sleep aid, especially in the form of diphenhydramine [[citrate]]. It is produced and marketed under the trade name [[Benadryl]] by [[McNeil Laboratories|McNeil-PPC]] (a division of [[Johnson & Johnson]]) in the U.S., Canada and South Africa (trade names in other countries include Dimedrol, Daedalon and Nytol). It is also available as a [[generic medication|generic]] or [[store brand]] medication.

== Medical uses ==

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine used to treat a number of conditions including [[allergic]] symptoms and [[pruritus|itchiness]], the [[common cold]], [[insomnia]], [[motion sickness]] and [[extrapyramidal symptoms]].<ref name="AHFS_monograph">{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/monograph/diphenhydramine-hydrochloride.html | title = Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Monograph | publisher = The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists  | work = Drugs.com }}</ref><ref name="Brown_2012">{{cite journal | author = Brown HE, Stoklosa J, Freudenreich O | title = How to stabilize an acutely psychotic patient  | journal = Current Psychiatary | volume = 11 | issue = 12 | pages = 10–16 | year = 2012 | month = December | pmid = | doi = | url = http://stg.currentpsychiatry.com/pdf/1112/1112CP_Freudenreich.pdf }}</ref>

Diphenhydramine is significantly more potent in treatment of allergies than newer generation of antihistamines.<ref name="pmid16680933">{{cite journal | author = Raphael GD, Angello JT, Wu MM, Druce HM | title = Efficacy of diphenhydramine vs desloratadine and placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe seasonal allergic rhinitis | journal = Ann.

Diphenhydramine is available as an [[over-the-counter drug]] (OTC) or prescription-only solution for injection. Injectable diphenhydramine can be used for life-threatening reactions ([[anaphylaxis]]) to allergens such as bee stings, peanuts, or latex, as an adjunct to [[epinephrine]].<ref name="Current EM">{{cite book | editor = Roger L. Humphries RL, Stone CK | title = CURRENT Diagnosis and Treatment Emergency Medicine, | edition = Seventh | series = LANGE CURRENT Series)\ | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | location = | year = 2011 | pages = | isbn = 0-07-170107-9 | chapter = Chapter 11: Shock | author = Young WF }}</ref>

As a potent antagonist to [[acetylcholine]] in [[muscarinic receptors]], diphenhydramine is used to treat [[parkinsonism|Parkinson's disease-like]] [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] caused by [[typical antipsychotics]]. The muscarinic receptor antagonism leads to correction of levels of [[dopamine]], the neurotransmitter responsible for control of motor function in the brain, similar to other [[antimuscarinic]] agents such as [[atropine]].<ref name="Katzung Basic Ch28">{{cite book | editor = Katzung B,  Masters S, Trevor A | title = Basic & Clinical Pharmacology | edition = 12th | year = 2012 | publisher = The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. | isbn = 978-0-07-176401-8 | pages = 483–500 | author = Aminoff MJ | chapter = Chapter 28.

Because of these sedative properties, diphenhydramine is widely used in [[Over-the-counter drug|nonprescription]] sleep aids for insomnia. The maximum recommended dose is 50&nbsp;mg (as the [[hydrochloride]] salt), as mandated by the U.S. FDA. The drug is an ingredient in several products sold as sleep aids, either alone or in combination with other ingredients such as [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol). An example of the latter is [[Tylenol PM]]. Examples of products having diphenhydramine as the only active ingredient include [[Unisom]], Tylenol Simply Sleep, [[Nytol]], ZzzQuil, and [[Sominex]] (the version sold in the US and Canada; that sold in the UK uses [[promethazine]]). Tolerance against the sedating effect of diphenhydramine builds very quickly; after three days of use at the common dosage, it is no more effective than a [[placebo]].<ref name="pmid12352276">{{cite journal | author = Richardson GS, Roehrs TA, Rosenthal L, Koshorek G, Roth T | title = Tolerance to daytime sedative effects of H1 antihistamines | journal = J.

Diphenhydramine also has [[antiemetic]] properties, which make it useful in treating the nausea that occurs in motion sickness. As it causes marked sedation in many individuals, newer-generation antihistamines, including [[loratadine]], [[cetirizine]], and [[dimenhydrinate]], may be preferred for antiemetic use.<ref name="Katzung Basic Ch16">{{cite book | editor = Katzung B,  Masters S, Trevor A | title = Basic & Clinical Pharmacology | edition = 12th | year = 2012 | publisher = The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. | isbn = 978-0-07-176401-8 | pages = 274–277 | author = Katzung B | chapter = Chapter 16.

There are also topical formulations of diphenhydramine available, including creams, lotions, gels, and sprays. These are used to relieve itching, and have the advantage of causing much less systemic effect (i.e. drowsiness) than oral forms.<ref name = "MedlinePlus_Diphenhydramine">{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|a601044|Diphenhydramine Topical}}</ref> Diphenhydramine also has [[local anesthetic]] properties, and has been used as such in patients allergic to common [[local anesthetics]] like [[lidocaine]].<ref name="pmid10456039">{{cite journal | author = Smith DW, Peterson MR, DeBerard SC | title = Local anesthesia.

== Adverse effects ==

Diphenhydramine is a potent [[anticholinergic]] agent. This activity is responsible for the [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of dry mouth and throat, [[tachycardia|increased heart rate]], [[mydriasis|pupil dilation]], [[urinary retention]], constipation, and, at high doses, hallucinations or [[delirium]]. Other side-effects include motor impairment ([[ataxia]]), flushed skin, blurred vision at nearpoint owing to lack of accommodation ([[cycloplegia]]), abnormal sensitivity to bright light ([[photophobia]]), sedation, difficulty concentrating, short-term memory loss, visual disturbances, irregular breathing, dizziness, irritability, itchy skin, confusion, decreased body temperature (in general, in the hands and/or feet), [[erectile dysfunction]], excitability, and, although it can be used to treat nausea, higher doses may cause vomiting.<ref name="diph effects">{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/sfx/diphenhydramine-side-effects.html | title = Diphenhydramine Side Effects | publisher = Drugs.com | accessdate = 2009-04-06 }}</ref> Some side effects, such as [[Fasciculation|twitching]], may be delayed until the drowsiness begins to cease and the person is in more of an awakening mode.

In the 1960s, diphenhydramine was found to inhibit [[reuptake]] of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]].<ref name="Domino_1999"/> This discovery led to a search for viable [[antidepressant]]s with similar structures and fewer side-effects, culminating in the invention of [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI).<ref name="Domino_1999">{{cite journal | author = Domino EF | title = History of modern psychopharmacology: a personal view with an emphasis on antidepressants | journal = Psychosom.

== Society and culture ==
Diphenhydramine is sometimes used recreationally as a [[deliriant]], or as a potentiator of alcohol,<ref name="urlDiphenhydramine and Alcohol / Food Interactions - Drugs.com">{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/food-interactions/diphenhydramine.html | title = Diphenhydramine and Alcohol / Food Interactions | publisher = Drugs.com }}</ref><ref name="pmid10344773">{{cite journal | author = Zimatkin SM, Anichtchik OV | title = Alcohol-histamine interactions | journal = Alcohol Alcohol. | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–7 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10344773 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/34.2.141 }}</ref> opiates<ref name="urlOpiate potentiation and side-effects">{{cite web | author = Sandor I | url = http://www.opioids.com/opiates/index.html | title = Using Antihistamines, Anticholinergics, and Depressants To Potentiate Opiates, And Dealing With Opiate Side Effects | work = Antihistamine Aficionado Magazine | date = 2000-07-30 }}</ref> and other [[depressant]]s. Diphenhydramine is deemed to have limited abuse potential in the United States due its potentially serious side effect profile and limited euphoric effects, and is not a controlled substance.
