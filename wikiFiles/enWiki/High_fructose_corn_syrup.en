===Cane and beet sugar===
[[Sugarcane|Cane sugar]] and [[Sugar beet|beet sugar]] are both relatively pure [[sucrose]]. While glucose and fructose (the two components of HFCS) are [[monosaccharides]], sucrose is a [[disaccharide]] composed of glucose and fructose linked together with a relatively weak [[glycosidic bond]]. The fact that sucrose, glucose and fructose are unique, distinct molecules complicates the comparison between cane and beet sugar (sucrose) and HFCS. A molecule of sucrose (with a chemical formula of C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) can be broken down into a molecule of glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) plus a molecule of fructose (also C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, an [[isomer]] of glucose) in a weakly acidic environment by a process called [[Inverted sugar syrup|inversion]].<ref>Sugar Confectionery Manufacture, E. B. Jackson, Springer, 1995, ISBN 0-8342-1297-8 (page 109 and 115)</ref> Sucrose is [[Inverted sugar syrup|broken down]] during [[digestion]] into a mixture of 50% fructose and 50% glucose through [[hydrolysis]] by the enzyme [[sucrase]]. People with [[sucrase]] deficiency cannot digest (break down) sucrose and thus exhibit [[sucrose intolerance]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Neale G, Clark M, Levin B |title=Intestinal sucrase deficiency presenting as sucrose intolerance in adult life |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=2 |issue=5472 |pages=1223–5 |year=1965 |month=November |pmid=5850689 |pmc=1846606 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5472.1223}}</ref>

===Honey===
[[Honey]] is a mixture of different types of sugars, water, and small amounts of other compounds.  Honey typically has a fructose/glucose ratio similar to HFCS 55, as well as containing some sucrose and other sugars. Like HFCS, honey contains water and has approximately 3 kcal per gram.  Because of its similar sugar profile and lower price, HFCS has been used illegally to "stretch" honey. As a result, checks for adulteration of honey no longer test for higher-than-normal levels of sucrose, which HFCS does not contain, but instead test for small quantities of proteins that can be used to differentiate between HFCS and honey.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Winston |first=Mark L. |title=From where I sit: essays on bees, beekeeping, and science |publisher=Comstock Pub. Associates |location=Ithaca |year=1998 |page=109 |isbn=0-8014-8478-2}}</ref>

==Production==
HFCS was first introduced by Richard O. Marshall and
Earl R. Kooi in 1957. They were, however, unsuccessful in making it viable for mass production.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1126/science.125.3249.648}}</ref> The industrial production process and creation was made by Dr. Yoshiyuki Takasaki at the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology of Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan in 1965–1970. HFCS was rapidly introduced to many processed foods and [[soft drink]]s in the U.S. from about 1975 to 1985.

HFCS is produced by milling corn ([[maize]]) to produce [[corn starch]], then processing that starch to yield [[corn syrup]], which is almost entirely glucose, and then adding [[enzyme]]s that change some of the glucose into fructose.  The resulting syrup (after enzyme conversion) contains approximately 42% fructose and is HFCS 42.  Some of the 42% fructose is then purified to 90% fructose, HFCS 90.  To make HFCS 55, the HFCS 90 is mixed with HFCS 42 in the appropriate ratios to form the desired HFCS 55. The enzyme process that changes the corn starch into HFCS 42 is as follows:
# [[alpha-amylase]] – produces shorter chains of sugars called [[oligosaccharide]]s from raw [[cornstarch]].
# [[Glucoamylase]] – breaks the oligosaccharides down even further to yield the simple sugar glucose.
# [[Xylose isomerase]] (aka glucose isomerase) – converts glucose to a mixture of about 42% fructose and 50–52% glucose with some other sugars mixed in.

Although both types of amylase are naturally produced by many animals (including humans), the most common method of commercial production is [[Industrial fermentation|microbial fermentation]].  Xylose isomerase is not native to animals; and in [[Glycolysis|standard glycolysis]] the glucose molecules are isomerized only after phosphorylation by [[glucose-6-phosphate isomerase]] yielding [[fructose 6-phosphate]].  Fructose molecules are phosphorylated  by [[fructokinase]] and enter the glycolytic pathway at this point.

While inexpensive alpha-amylase and glucoamylase are added directly to the slurry and used only once, the more costly xylose-isomerase is packed into columns and the sugar mixture is then passed over it, allowing it to be used repeatedly until it loses its activity. This 42–43% fructose glucose mixture is then subjected to a liquid [[chromatography]] step, where the fructose is enriched to about 90%. The 90% fructose is then back-blended with 42% fructose to achieve a 55% fructose final product. Most manufacturers use carbon [[adsorption]] for impurity removal. Numerous filtration, ion-exchange and evaporation steps are also part of the overall process.

The units of measurement for sucrose is degrees [[Brix]] (symbol °Bx). Brix is a measurement of the mass ratio of dissolved sucrose to water in a liquid. A 25 °Bx solution has 25&nbsp;grams of sucrose per 100&nbsp;grams of solution (25% w/w). Or, to put it another way, there are 25&nbsp;grams of sucrose and 75&nbsp;grams of water in the 100&nbsp;grams of solution.  The Brix measurement was introduced by Antoine Brix.

A more universal measurement of sugars, including HFCS, is called dry solids.  Dry solids is defined as the mass ratio of dry sugars to the total weight of the sugar solution.  Since Brix is based on the refractive index of light against a sucrose molecule it is not accurate when measuring other sugars such as glucose, [[maltose]], and fructose.

When an infrared Brix sensor is used, it measures the vibrational frequency of the sucrose molecules, giving a Brix degrees measurement. This will not be the same measurement as Brix degrees using a density or refractive index measurement, because it will specifically measure dissolved sugar concentration instead of all dissolved solids. When a refractometer is used, it is correct to report the result as "refractometric dried substance" (RDS). One might speak of a liquid as being 20 °Bx RDS. This is a measure of percent by weight of ''total'' dried solids and, although not technically the same as Brix degrees determined through an infrared method, renders an accurate measurement of sucrose content, since the majority of dried solids are in fact sucrose.

Recently, an isotopic method for quantifying sweeteners derived from corn and sugar cane was developed which permits measurement of corn syrup- and cane sugar-derived sweeteners in humans, thus allowing dietary assessment of the intake of these substances relative to total intake.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jahren AH, Saudek C, Yeung EH, Kao WH, Kraft RA, Caballero B |title=An isotopic method for quantifying sweeteners derived from corn and sugar cane |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=1380–1384 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17158420 |url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/84/6/1380.full.pdf}}</ref>

==Sweetener consumption patterns==

===Historical===
Prior to the development of the worldwide sugar industry, dietary fructose was limited to only a few items.  Milk, meats and most vegetables, the staples of many early diets, have no fructose and only 5–10% fructose by weight is found in fruits such as grapes, apples and blueberries.  Molasses and common dried fruits have a content of less than 10% fructose sugar.  From 1970 to 2000 there has been a 25% increase in "added sugars".<ref name="Bray2007">{{cite journal|last=Bray|first=George A. |journal=Am J Clin Nutr|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/86/4/895.full.pdf |title=How bad is fructose? |publisher=American Society for Clinical Nutrition |date=October 2007|volume=86|issue=4|pages=895–896|pmid=1792136 }}</ref>

===United States===
[[File:Usda sweeteners.svg|thumb|300px|right|US sweetener consumption, 1966–2009, in dry pounds. It is apparent from this graph that overall sweetener consumption, and in particular glucose-fructose mixtures, has increased since the introduction of HFCS. Thus, the amount of fructose consumed in the United States has increased since the early 1980s.

A system of sugar tariffs and sugar quotas imposed in 1977<!--the US has heavily taxed imported sugar a lot longer than that--> in the United States significantly increased the cost of imported sugar and U.S. producers sought cheaper sources. HFCS derived from corn is more economical because the domestic U.S. prices of sugar are twice the global price<ref>[[Grist]] [http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2006/5/10/135951/485 ADM, high-fructose corn syrup, and ethanol]

==Apiculture (Bee Keeping)==
In the United States, HFCS has become a sucrose replacement for [[honey bees]]. In 2009, a study by Leblanc ''et al.'' found that at temperatures above {{convert|45|C|F}} HFCS rapidly forms [[hydroxymethylfurfural]], which is toxic to the honey bees being fed HFCS.<ref>{{cite journal|last=LeBlanc|first=Blaise W.|coauthors=Eggleston, Gillian; Sammataro, Diana; Cornett, Charles; Dufault, Renee; Deeby, Thomas; St. Cyr, Eldwin|title=Formation of Hydroxymethylfurfural in Domestic High-Fructose Corn Syrup and Its Toxicity to the Honey Bee (Apis mellifera)|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|date=26 August 2009|volume=57|issue=16|pages=7369–7376|doi=10.1021/jf9014526}}</ref>  In 2012, a study by Chensheng Lu et al. found symptoms of [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD) in beehives fed HFCS that the researchers laced with levels of a pesticide hypothesized to have been present in HFCS feed back in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal |title=''In situ'' replication of honey bee colony collapse disorder |first1=Chensheng |last1=Lu |first2=Kenneth |last2=Warchol |first3=Richard A. |last3=Callahan |journal=Bulletin of Insectology |volume=65 |issue=13 |month=March |year=2012 |issn=1721-8861 |url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/chensheng-lu/files/in-situ-replication-of-honey-bee-colony-collapse-disorder.pdf}}</ref>

A 2013 study by Wenfu Mao and colleagues from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign report that "constituents found in honey, including [[p-coumaric acid]], [[pinocembrin]], and [[pinobanksin|pinobanksin 5-methyl ether]], specifically induce detoxification genes."  They found that adding p-coumaric acid to a diet of sucrose increases midgut metabolism of [[coumaphos]], a widely used in-hive pesticide used for controlling [[Varroa mites]], by approximately 60%.  Since p-coumaric acid is a major component of [[pollen]], it is part of the natural diet of honey bees, and may help regulate immune and detoxification processes.  They conclude: "Using honey substitutes, including HFCS, may thus compromise the ability of honey bees to cope with pesticides and pathogens and contribute to colony losses."<ref>{{cite journal||first1=Wenfu |last1=Maoa |first2=Mary A. |last2=Schulerb |first3=May R. |last3=Berenbaum |title=Honey constituents up-regulate detoxification and immunity genes in the western honey bee ''Apis mellifera''|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|date=29 April 2013|year=2013|month=04|volume=Published online before print|doi=10.1073/pnas.1303884110|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/04/26/1303884110|accessdate=2 May 2013|quote=We determined that constituents found in honey, including [[p-coumaric acid]], [[pinocembrin]], and [[pinobanksin|pinobanksin 5-methyl ether]], specifically induce detoxification genes. These inducers are primarily found not in nectar but in pollen in the case of p-coumaric acid (a monomer of [[sporopollenin]], the principal constituent of [[pollen]] cell walls) and [[propolis]], a resinous material gathered and processed by bees to line wax cells. [[RNA-seq]] analysis (massively parallel RNA sequencing) revealed that p-coumaric acid specifically up-regulates all classes of detoxification genes as well as select [[antimicrobial peptide]] genes. This up-regulation has functional significance in that that adding p-coumaric acid to a diet of sucrose increases midgut metabolism of [[coumaphos]], a widely used in-hive [[acaricide]], by ∼60%. As a major component of pollen grains, p-coumaric acid is ubiquitous in the natural diet of honey bees and may function as a [[nutraceutical]] regulating immune and detoxification processes. The widespread [[apiculture|apicultural]] use of honey substitutes, including high-fructose corn syrup, may thus compromise the ability of honey bees to cope with pesticides and pathogens and contribute to colony losses. (From the abstract.)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Yirka|first=Bob|title=Researchers find high-fructose corn syrup may be tied to worldwide collapse of bee colonies|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-high-fructose-corn-syrup-tied-worldwide.html|work=Phys.org|accessdate=2 May 2013|date=30 April 2013|month=4|year=2013|quote=A team of entomologists from the University of Illinois has found a possible link between the practice of feeding commercial honeybees high-fructose corn syrup and the collapse of honeybee colonies around the world.  ... Since approximately 2006, groups that manage commercial honeybee colonies have been reporting what has become known as colony collapse disorder—whole colonies of bees simply died, of no apparent cause. As time has passed, the disorder has been reported at sites all across the world, even as scientists have been racing to find the cause, and a possible cure. To date, most evidence has implicated pesticides used to kill other insects such as mites. In this new effort, the researchers have found evidence to suggest the real culprit might be high-fructose corn syrup, which beekeepers have been feeding bees as their natural staple, honey, has been taken away from them. ... The researchers aren't suggesting that high-fructose corn syrup is itself toxic to bees, instead, they say their findings indicate that by eating the replacement food instead of honey, the bees are not being exposed to other chemicals that help the bees fight off toxins, such as those found in pesticides.}}</ref>

==Public relations==
{{main|Public relations of high-fructose corn syrup}}
There are various public relations issues with HFCS, including its labeling as "natural",  its advertising, companies that have moved back to sugar, and a proposed name change to 'corn sugar'. In 2010 the [[Corn Refiners Association]] applied to allow HFCS to be renamed 'corn sugar', but was rejected by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 2012.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57444586-10391704/fda-rejects-industry-bid-to-change-name-of-high-fructose-corn-syrup-to-corn-sugar/ FDA rejects industry bid to change name of high fructose corn syrup to "corn sugar"]</ref>
