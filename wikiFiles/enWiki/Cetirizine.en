'''Cetirizine'''  ({{IPAc-en|icon|s|ɛ|ˈ|t|ɪr|ɨ|z|iː|n}}), a second-generation<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/561316</ref> [[antihistamine]] used in the treatment of [[allergies]], [[hay fever]], [[angioedema]], and [[urticaria]]. It is a major [[metabolite]] of [[hydroxyzine]], and a [[racemic]] [[histamine H1 receptor|selective H<sub>1</sub> receptor]] [[inverse agonist]].

== Availability ==
[[File:Cetirizine10.JPG|thumb|left|120px]]

Formerly prescription-only in the USA and Canada, cetirizine is now available [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] in both countries<ref>

In Turkey, Australia and New Zealand, Zyrtec is available over-the-counter in pharmacies and in the UK cetirizine can be sold in limited quantities off-the-shelf in any outlet and is often available in supermarkets. {{As of|2009}}, Germany made many generic drugs containing cetirizine available in pharmacies without prescription.<ref>{{cite web | title=Cetirizin | url=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetirizin }}</ref> Norway, Sweden,<ref>{{cite web | title=Cetirizin | url=http://receptfria.se/sandoz_camp/front/front/visa_underkategori?h_kategori_id=5&u_kategori_id=12 }}</ref> Finland, Poland and Israel also recognize Cetirizine as an [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] medicine. In India, it is sold over-the-counter as brand-name "CTZ" (formerly called "Cetzine"), even though it remains classified as a [[Schedule H]] (prescription) drug.<ref>[http://www.drugscontrol.org/Schedule_H.pdf Drugs and Cosmetics (2nd amendment) rules, 2006]. item 104 in schedule H.</ref> India also classifies Cetirizine as an OTC drug. It is used as an alternative to [[Pheniramine]] (Avil) which is not given as OTC anymore in India.

== Pharmacology ==
Cetirizine crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] only slightly, reducing the sedative side-effect common with older antihistamines.<ref name="blood-brain">{{cite journal| doi =  10.1124/dmd.105.007211| title = Brain distribution of cetirizine enantiomers: comparison of three different tissue-to-plasma partition coefficients: K(p), K(p,u), and K(p,uu)| last = Gupta| first = A| coauthors = Chatelain P, Massingham R, Jonsson EN, Hammarlund-Udenaes M| journal = Drug Metab.

== Administration method and metabolism ==

Chewable, non-chewable,  and syrup forms of cetirizine are similarly absorbed rapidly and effectively, with absorbed food minutely affecting the absorption rate which yields a peak serum level one hour after administration;<ref name="drugref_cetirizine">{{cite book| author = Anderson, Philip; Knoben, James E.; Troutman, William G.| title = Handbook of clinical drug data| publisher = McGraw-Hill| location = New York| year = 2002| page = 807| isbn = 0-07-136362-9
| accessdate = 2009-11-19}}</ref> in a study of healthy volunteers prescribed 10&nbsp;mg tablets, once daily for 10 days, a mean peak serum level of 311&nbsp;ng/mL was observed.<ref name="pfizer_ceti_p3">{{cite web| url = http://www.pfizer.com/files/products/uspi_zyrtec.pdf| title = Zyrtec prescribing information| date = May 2006 | accessdate = 2009-11-19}}</ref> The metabolic effects of cetirizine are long acting, remaining in the system for a maximum of 21 hours before being excreted; the average elimination half-life is 8 hours. About 70% of the drug is removed through urination, of which half is observed as unchanged cetirizine compound. Another 10% is excreted.<ref name="drugref_cetirizine"/><ref name="pfizer_ceti_p3"/>

Like many other antihistamine medications, cetirizine is commonly prescribed in combination with [[pseudoephedrine hydrochloride]], a [[decongestant]].  These combinations are marketed using the same brand name as the cetirizine with a "-D" suffix ('''Zyrtec-D''', '''Virlix-D''', etc.)

== Indications ==

=== Allergies ===
Cetirizine's primary indication is for hay fever and other allergies. Because the symptoms of itching and redness in these conditions are caused by histamine acting on the H1 receptor, blocking those receptors temporarily relieves those symptoms.

=== Rhinovirus infection ===
[[Interleukin 6]] and [[interleukin 8]] have been shown to be elevated in acute respiratory distress syndrome.<ref name="pmid8406851">{{cite journal| last1=Chollet-Martin| first1=S| last2=Montravers| first2=P| last3=Gibert| first3=C| last4=Elbim| first4=C| last5=Desmonts| first5=JM| last6=Fagon| first6=JY| last7=Gougerot-Pocidalo| first7=MA| title=High levels of interleukin-8 in the blood and alveolar spaces of patients with pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome| journal=Infection and immunity| volume=61| issue=11| pages=4553–9| year=1993| pmid=8406851| pmc=281204}}</ref> Cetirizine contains <small>L</small>- and <small>D</small>-[[stereoisomer]]s.  Chemically, [[levocetirizine]] is the active <small>L</small>-[[enantiomer]] of cetirizine. One recent study of airway epithelial cells showed that Levocetirizine may have beneficial effects on the pathophysiologic changes related to human rhinovirus ([[rhinovirus|HRV]]) infection.<ref name="pmid19110001">{{cite journal| author = Jang YJ, Wang JH, Kim JS, Kwon HJ, Yeo NK, Lee BJ| title = Levocetirizine inhibits rhinovirus-induced ICAM-1 and cytokine expression and viral replication in airway epithelial cells

=== Kimura's disease ===
Cetirizine is an effective agent in treating the symptoms of [[Kimura's disease]], which mostly occurs in young Asian men, affecting the lymph nodes and soft tissue of the head and neck in the form of tumor-like lesions. Cetirizine's properties of being effective  both in the treatment of [[pruritus]] (itching) and as an anti-inflammatory agent make it suitable for the treatment of the pruritus associated with these lesions.<ref name="kimura">{{cite journal|author = Ben-Chetrit E, Amir G, Shalit M| title = Cetirizine: An effective agent in Kimura's disease| journal = Arthritis Rheum.| volume = 53| issue = 1|pages = 117–8| year = 2005| month = February|doi = 10.1002/art.20908| pmid = 15696573}}</ref>  In a 2005 study, the American College of Rheumatology conducted treatments initially using [[prednisone]], followed by steroid dosages and [[azathioprine]],  [[omeprazole]], and [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] supplements over the course of two years.<ref name="kimura" /> The skin condition of the patient began to improve and the skin lesions lessened. However, there were symptoms of [[cushing syndrome|cushingoid]] and [[hirsutism]] observed before the patient was removed from the courses of steroids and placed on 10&nbsp;mg/day of cetirizine to prevent skin lesions;<ref name="kimura" /> an agent suitable for the treatment of pruritus associated with such lesions.<ref name="kimura" /> Asymptomatically, the patient's skin lesions disappeared after treatment with cetirizine, blood [[eosinophil]] counts became normal,<ref name="kimura" />  corticosteroid effects were resolved,<ref name="kimura" /> and a remission began within a period of two months.<ref name="kimura" />  It is also thought that the inhibition of eosinophils may be the key to treatment of Kimura's disease due to the role of eosinophils, rather than other cells with regards to the lesions of the skin.<ref name="kimura"/>

==Side effects==
Dryness of the mouth, nose and throat, drowsiness, urinary retention, blurred vision, nightmares and stomach ache are commonly reported side effects of this drug.<ref>{{cite book | title=British National Formulary (BNF) 61 | year=2011}}</ref> Cetirizine does not block the action of the [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, even though these side effects can occur in some patients. Also, cetirizine does not have [[dopamine antagonist|antidopaminergic]] properties. In 2012 FDA added cetirizine in Drugs to Watch List for [[oculogyric crisis]].<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/773081?src=mp</ref>

==Synthesis==
The following synthesis of this compound was reported in 1985:<ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 4525358 | status = patent | title = 2-[4-(Diphenylmethyl)-1-piperazinyl]-acetic acids and their amides | gdate = 1985-06-25 | fdate = 1983-05-17 | pridate = YYYY-MM-DD | inventor = Baltes E, De Lannoy J, Rodriguez L | assign1 = UCB Pharmaceuticals, Inc }}</ref>
