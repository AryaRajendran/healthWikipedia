The '''cranial nerve exam''' is part of the [[neurological examination]]. It is used to identify problems with the [[cranial nerves]] by [[physical examination]].

| I: [[Olfactory nerve]]
| [[Olfaction|Smell]] is tested in each [[nostril]] separately by placing stimuli under one nostril and occluding the opposing nostril. The stimuli used should be non-irritating and identifiable. Some example stimuli include [[cinnamon]], [[cloves]], and [[toothpaste]]. Bilateral loss can occur with [[rhinitis]], [[smoking]], or [[aging]]. Unilateral loss indicates a possible nerve lesion or deviated septum. 

This test is usually skipped on a cranial nerve exam.<ref name="BrillmanKahan2005">{{cite book|author1=Jon Brillman|author2=Scott Kahan|title=In A Page Neurology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fSlFA8B24FgC&pg=PA4|accessdate=27 June 2011|date=1 March 2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-1-4051-0432-6|pages=4â€“}}</ref>

| II: [[Optic nerve]]
| '''[[Visual acuity]]''' is tested in each [[human eye|eye]] separately. Ensure the patient's vision is corrected with [[eyeglasses]] or a pinhole. The patient is asked to read progressively smaller lines on the '''near card''' or ''Snellen chart''. 

'''[[Visual fields]]''' are assess by asking the patient to cover one eye while the examiner tests the opposite eye. The examiner wiggles the finger in each of the four quadrants and asks the patient to state when the finger is seen in the [[peripheral vision|periphery]]. The examiner's visual fields should be normal, since it is used as the baseline.  

'''[[Fundoscopy]]''

'''[[Pupillary light reflex]]'''
The patient stares into the distance as the examiner shines the [[penlight]] obliquely into each [[pupil]]. Pupillary constriction should be noted on the eye examined (direct response) and on the opposite eye (consensual response). The '''[[swinging flashlight test]]''' involves moving the light between the two pupils. Normally both direct and consensual responses are ellicited when the light shines on an eye, and some [[pupil dilation|dilation]] will occur during the swing between.

| III, IV, VI: [[Oculomotor nerve]], [[Trochlear nerve]], [[Abducens nerve]]
| Extraocular movements: First, '''inspect''' for [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], eye position and [[physiologic nystagmus|nystagmus]]. The pupil size should be measured, its shape and any asymmetry should be noted. A commonly used abbreviation to describe normal pupils is [[PERRLA]] (pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation).

The examiner tests ocular movements by standing one meter in front of the patient and asking the patient to follow a target with eyes only, and not the head. The target is moved in an "H" shape and the patient is asked to report any [[diplopia]]. Then, the target is held at the lateral ends of the patient's visual field. Nystagmus should be noted. One or two beats is a normal finding. The '''[[accommodation reflex]]''' is tested by moving the target towards the patient's nose. As the eyes converge, the pupils should constrict. The '''optokinetic nystagmus''' test is optional and involves asking the patient to look at a moving strip of horizontal lines. Nystagmus is normally observed.

| V: [[Trigeminal nerve]]
| '''Light touch''' is tested in each of the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve and on each side of the face using a cotton wisp or tissue paper. The ophthalmic division is tested by touching the forehead, the maxillary division is tested by touching the cheeks, and the mandibular division is tested by touching the chin. Be careful not to test the mandibular division too laterally, as the mandible is innervated by the [[great auricular nerve]] (C2 and C3). A common mistake is to use a stroking motion, which will trigger pain and temperature nerves. Instead, a point stimulus should be applied. For '''pain and temperature''' repeat the same steps as light touch but use a sharp object and a cold tuning fork respectively.

'''[[Corneal reflex]]''' is conducted along with the [[facial nerve]] section of the test. Note the sensory innervation of the cornea is provided by the [[trigeminal nerve]] while the motor innervation for blinking the eye is provided by the [[facial nerve]].-

'''[[Muscles of mastication]]''' ([[temporalis]], [[masseter]]) should be inspected for atrophy. Palpate the temporalis and masseter as the patient clenches the jaw. The pterygoids can be tested by asking the patient to keep the mouth open against resistance, and move from side to side against resistance. A [[jaw jerk reflex]] can be tested by placing a finger over the patient's chin and then tapping the finger with a reflex hammer. Normally the jaw moves minimally.

| VII: [[Facial nerve]]
| Inspect for facial asymmetry and involuntary movements. 
*Motor
1) Raise both eyebrows

2) Frown

3) Close both eyes tightly so that you can not open them. Test muscular strength by trying to open them

4) Show both upper and lower teeth

5) Smile

6) Puff out both cheeks
* Sensory : test for taste

| [[Bell's Palsy]], [[Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome]]

|-
| VIII: [[Vestibulocochlear]]
| 
*Hearing: Whisper numbers in one ear and ask the patient to repeat the numbers. Make sure to cover the opposite ear. Conduct the [[Rinne test]] and [[Weber test]].
*Vestibular Function
| [[acoustic neuroma]]
|-
| IX and X: [[Glossopharyngeal]] and [[Vagus]]
| 
*Gag response
*Palatal articulation "KA"
*Guttural articulation "GO"
| [[Lateral medullary syndrome]] (IX)
|-
| XI: [[Accessory nerve]]
| 
*Shrug shoulders
*Turn head from side to side
|
|-
| XII: [[Hypoglossal]]
| 
* Inspect for tongue atrophy, fasciculations or asymmetry
