The [[active ingredient]] in hand sanitizers may be [[Isopropyl alcohol|isopropanol]], [[ethanol]], [[Propan-1-ol|n-propanol]], or [[povidone-iodine]].

Common non-alcohol, rinse-free hand sanitizers use either small concentrations of the nitrogenous cationic surface-acting agent [[benzalkonium chloride]], the chlorinated aromatic compound [[triclosan]], or [[povidone-iodine]].  Some products claim to kill microorganisms naturally, although these claims are not substantiated in any FDA monograph. All hand sanitizer products require [[National Drug Code]] designation in United States and [[natural product number]] designation in Canada.

==Uses==

Consumer alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and [[health care]] ''hand alcohol'' or ''alcohol hand antiseptic agents'', are [[antiseptic]] products used to avoid transmission of [[pathogen]]s. These exist in liquid, foam, and easy-flowing gel formulations. The level of [[alcohol]] varies between 60% and 85%. The most commonly used level is 62%.  

Alcohol rub sanitizers kill most bacteria, and fungi, and stop some viruses.  Alcohol rub sanitizers containing at least 70% alcohol (mainly [[ethyl alcohol]]) kill 99.9% of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999%<ref group="note">research papers often use "n-log" to mean a reduction of n on a (base 10) logarithmic scale graphing the number of bacteria, thus "5-log" means a reduction by a factor of 10<sup>5</sup>, or 99.999%</ref> in one minute.<ref name=cvvs>{{ cite journal | last = Rotter M.| title = Hand washing and hand disinfection  | journal = Hospital epidemiology and infection control| volume = 87 | year = 1999 }}</ref>

Alcohol is considered [[haraam]] (sinful) in Islamic tradition.

The Centers for Disease Control says the most important way to prevent the transmission of dangerous diseases is to frequently wash your hands with soap and water and/or use a hand sanitizer.  If soap and water are not available it is recommended to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol or contains a "persistent antiseptic".<ref name="CDC – Clean Hands Save Lives">[http://www.cdc.gov/cleanhands/ CDC – Clean Hands Save Lives]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref><ref>

Not all forms of bacterial pathogens are equally susceptible.  Certain spores of [[endospore]] forming bacteria, especially the endospores of [[gram-positive bacteria]] (e.g. [[Clostridium difficile]]) are relatively resistant to sanitizers and soap and water and remain biologically viable after their use. During the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] on the United States Postal Service, authorities warned that alcohol hand rubs and soap and water would not kill anthrax endospores but they will kill the anthrax bacteria.

Some medical opinions question the effectiveness of alcohol-based hand sanitizers for preventing influenza.  Arthur Reingold, vaccine specialist who has advised for the WHO, worries that "in the determination to tell people what they can do to protect themselves, people pooh-pooh things like masks, which really are effective against influenza, and are reluctant to get vaccinated." He claims that "washing hands really is wonderful for preventing many diseases, such as the common cold, but it's not very helpful to prevent influenza, [and that] studies done 40 and 50 years ago pretty much show it's impossible to get influenza through hand-to-hand contact". Instead, he says that "you must breathe the virus [right] into your lungs".<ref name=CBCsanitizer>

However, she says animal studies have shown that the virus can infect you through your nose, your throat, and even through the tear ducts of your eyes.<ref name=CBCsanitizer /> For example, research into the transmission of influenza from swine to humans has shown a statistically significant reduction in transmission if the handler wears gloves when working with sick animals, therefore implying that there is a distinct danger of catching the influenza virus via hand-to-face transmission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ramirez A, Capuano AW, Wellman DA, Lesher KA, Setterquist SF, Gray GC |title=Preventing zoonotic influenza virus infection |journal=Emerging Infect.

[[Peter Palese]], a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in New York City, has said that hand washing isn't all that helpful against the flu because the flu isn't like other respiratory diseases.  "The flu virus isn't very stable on the hand," he said. "The virus has a lipid membrane that flattens out when it's on your hand, and it gets inactivated."<ref name=CNNhealth>

"I think that hand contact accounts for maybe one-third of influenza infections," he says.<ref name=CNNhealth /> Furthermore, whereas the influenza virus can survive for only minutes on a person's hands, researchers have found that it can survive for hours (some say even days) on many other surfaces.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bean B, Moore BM, Sterner B, Peterson LR, Gerding DN, Balfour HH |title=Survival of influenza viruses on environmental surfaces |journal=J.

== Non-alcohol hand sanitizers ==

Some hand sanitizer products use agents other than alcohol to kill microorganisms, such as [[povidone-iodine]], [[benzalkonium chloride]] or [[triclosan]]. 

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC recommends "persistent" antiseptics for hand sanitizers.  Persistent activity is defined as the prolonged or extended antimicrobial activity that prevents or inhibits the proliferation or survival of microorganisms after application of the product. This activity may be demonstrated by sampling a site several minutes or hours after application and demonstrating bacterial antimicrobial effectiveness when compared with a baseline level. This property also has been referred to as "residual activity." Both substantive and nonsubstantive active ingredients can show a persistent effect if they substantially lower the number of bacteria during the wash period. SHBAN ([[Trademark symbol|TM]]) Non-Alcoholic Persistent Antiseptic contains povidone-iodine which is an FDA Class I persistent antiseptic.<ref name="Boyce John M., Pittet Didier"/>

Laboratory studies have shown lingering benzalkonium chloride may be associated with antibiotic resistance in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]<ref>{{cite journal | title = Increase in Resistance of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus to β-Lactams Caused by Mutations Conferring Resistance to Benzalkonium Chloride, a Disinfectant Widely Used in Hospitals| publisher = American Society for Microbiology | pmc= 89614 | year = 1999 | last1 = Akimitsu | first1 = N | last2 = Hamamoto | first2 = H | last3 = Inoue | first3 = RI | last4 = Shoji | first4 = M | last5 = Akamine | first5 = A | last6 = Takemori | first6 = KI | last7 = Hamasaki | first7 = N | last8 = Sekimizu | first8 = K | volume = 43 | issue = 12 | pages = 3042–3043 | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | pmid = 10651623}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3_supp/levy.htm| title = Antibacterial Household Products: Cause for Concern| accessdate =2001-06-01 | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> while no mechanism for resistance to alcohol has ever been described in bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal

Alcohol-free hand sanitizers may be effective immediately while on the skin, but the solutions themselves can become contaminated because alcohol is an in-solution preservative and without it, the alcohol-free solution itself is susceptible to contamination. However, even alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can become contaminated if the alcohol content is not properly controlled or the sanitizer is grossly contaminated with microorganisms during manufacture. In June 2009, alcohol-free Clarcon Antimicrobial Hand Sanitizer was pulled from the US market by the FDA, which found the product contained gross contamination of extremely high levels of various bacteria, including those which can "cause opportunistic infections of the skin and underlying tissues and could result in medical or surgical attention as well as permanent damage".  Gross contamination of any hand sanitizer by bacteria during manufacture will result in the failure of the effectiveness of that sanitizer and possible infection of the treatment site with the contaminating organisms.<ref>

==Safety==
Alcohol gel can catch fire, producing a translucent blue flame.  This is due to the [[flammable]] alcohol in the gel.  Some hand sanitizer gels may not produce this effect due to a high concentration of water or moisturizing agents. There have been some rare instances where alcohol has been implicated in starting fires in the operating room, including a case where alcohol used as an antiseptic pooled under the surgical drapes in an operating room and caused a fire when a cautery instrument was used. Alcohol gel was not implicated. To minimize the risk of fire, alcohol rub users are instructed to rub their hands until dry, which indicates that the flammable alcohol has evaporated.<ref name=CDC_20030915>{{cite web

== Hospital environment ==
[[Image:Handsprit.jpg|thumb|right|Hand alcohol in a hospital]]
Alcohol based hand rubs are extensively used in the hospital environment as an alternative to antiseptic soaps. Hand-rubs in the hospital environment have two applications: hygienic hand rubbing and surgical hand disinfection. Alcohol based hand rubs provide a better skin tolerance as compared to antiseptic soap.<ref name="Boyce 2000 442"/>
Hand rubs also prove to have more effective microbiological properties as compared to antiseptic soaps. 

The same ingredients used in over-the-counter hand-rubs are also used in hospital hand-rubs: alcohols such [[ethanol]] and [[isopropanol]], sometimes combined with [[quats]] (quaternary ammonium cations) such as [[benzalkonium chloride]].  Quats are added at levels up to 200 parts per million to increase antimicrobial effectiveness. Although allergy to alcohol-only rubs is rare, fragrances, preservatives and quats can cause contact allergies.<ref>{{ cite journal

The most common brands of alcohol hand rubs include Avant, Sterillium, Desderman and Allsept S. All hospital hand rubs must conform to certain regulations like EN 12054 for hygienic treatment and surgical disinfection by hand-rubbing. Products with a claim of "99.99% reduction" or 4Log reduction are ineffective in hospital environment, since the reduction must be more than "99.99%".<ref name="cvvs"/>

The hand sanitizer dosing systems for hospitals are designed to deliver a measured amount of the product for staff.  They are dosing pumps screwed onto a bottle or are specially designed dispensers with refill bottles. Dispensers for surgical hand disinfection are usually equipped with elbow controlled mechanism or infrared sensors to avoid any contact between with the pump.

=== Surgical hand disinfection ===

Hands must be disinfected before any surgical procedure by hand washing with mild soap (if hands are visibly dirty) and then hand-rubbing with a sanitizer. Surgical disinfection requires a larger dose of the hand-rub and a longer rubbing time than ordinarily.  It is usually done in two applications according to specific hand-rubbing techniques, EN1499 (hygienic handwash), and EN 1500 (hygienic hand disinfection) to ensure that antiseptic is applied everywhere on the surface of the hand.<ref>{{ cite journal | doi= 10.1053/jhin.2002.1357 | author= Kampf G, Ostermeyer C.| title = Inter-laboratory reproducibility of the hand disinfection reference procedure of EN 1500 | journal = J Hosp Infect| volume = 53 | issue=4 |pages=304–6 | year = Apr 2003 | pmid= 12660128 }}</ref>
