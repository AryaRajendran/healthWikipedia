{{Homicide}}
'''Neonaticide''' is the killing of a newborn infant less than a month old according to Resnick, 1970.

Neonaticide is rare in developed countries, when it does occur, it is most often the mother that kills the neonate; it is an exceptionally rare event amongst fathers.<ref>Dr. Neil S. Kaye M.D - Families, Murder, and Insanity: A Psychiatric Review of Paternal Neonaticide</ref>

==History==

An early reference to filicide (the killing of a child by a parent) is in Greek mythology, In his play, [[Medea (play)|''Medea'']], [[Euripides]] portrayed [[Medea]] as having killed her two sons after Jason abandoned her for the daughter of the King of Corinth<ref>Hamilton, E.: Mythology. New York, Mentor Book, 1942</ref> giving us what has been termed the Medea Complex.<ref>Wittels, F.: Psychoanalysis and literature, in Lorand, S. (ed): Psychoanalysis Today, Albanay, N.Y., Boyd Printing Co., 1944.</ref> Under the Roman Law, ''patria potestas'', the right of a father to kill his own children was protected.<ref>Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition: St. Paul, Minnesota, West Publishing Company</ref><ref>142 N.Y.S.2d 163</ref> It was not until the 4th century that the Roman state, influenced by Christianity, began to regard filicide as a crime. Still, mothers who killed their infants or newborns received lesser sentences under both the laws of the church and the state.<ref>Victoroff, V.: A case of Infanticide Related to Psychomotor Automitism: Psychodynamic, Physiological, Forensic and Sociological Considerations. J. Clin. Exper. Psychopath; 1955; 16: 191-220. 10. Langer, W.: Infanticide: A Historical Survey. History of Childhood Quarterly; 1974; 1: 354-365</ref> The church
consistently dealt more leniently with those mothers whose children died by "overlying," an accidental death by smothering when a sleeping parent rolled over on the infant. The opinions of the church in these deaths reflects an awareness of one of society's first attempts to understand the severe problem of overpopulation and overcrowding.<ref>Hale, M.: The History of the Pleas of the Crown. London, E.R. Nutt and R. Gosling, 1736.</ref> England has traditionally viewed infanticide as a "special crime," passing its first Infanticide Act in 1623 under the Stuarts and more recently in the Infanticide Acts of 1922 and 1938.<ref>Infanticide Act of 1938, 1 and 2 Geo. 6, c36, sec. 1 (1)</ref><ref>Jeudwine, J.: Observations on English Criminal Law and Procedure. London, D.S. King, 1968</ref> Most recently England passed the Infanticide Act of 1978 which
allows a lesser sentence for attempted infanticide.<ref>Wilkins, A.: Attempted Infanticide. British Journal of Psychiatry. 1985; 146: 206-208</ref> Unlike England and other European countries, the United States has not adopted special statutes to deal with infanticide or neonaticide. Nonetheless, juries and judges, as reflected in their verdicts and sentences, have consistently considered the difficulties and stresses of a mother during the post-partum period.<ref>[http://www.courtpsychiatrist.com Forensic Psychiatrist Expert Witness in Forensics Psychiatry - Dr. Neil S.

==Cultural aspects==

The Chinese, as late as the 20th century, dispatched newborn daughters because they were unable to transmit the family name. Additionally, daughters were viewed as weaker and not as useful in time of war or for agricultural work. In the past, Eskimos killed infants with known congenital anomalies and often one of a set of twins.<ref>Garber, C.: Eskimo Infanticide. Scient. Month. 1947; 64: 98- 102</ref> Similarly, Mohave Indians had killed all children of racially mixed birth at birth.<ref>Devereux, G.: Mohave Indidan Infanticide. Psychoanal. Rev. 1948; 35: 126-139</ref>
In their 1981 paper, Sakuta and Saito<ref>Sakuta, T. and Saito, S.: A Socio-Medical Study on 71 Cases of Infanticide in Japan.
Keio J. Med. 1981; 30: 155-168.</ref> reviewed infanticide in Japan and describe the two distinct types of infanticide commonly seen. The Mabiki type corresponds to the ancient means of "thinning out" or population control; the Anomie type, a product of modern society, corresponds to the "unwanted child."

==Neonaticide Statistics==

The United States ranks first in rates of homicide of children under the age of four years. Forty-five percent (45%) of all child murders occur in the first 24 hours of life, and thus can be classified as neonaticide.<ref>d'Orban, P.: Women who kill their Children. Brit. J. Psychiat 1979; 134: 560-571</ref> For the period 1982-1987, approximately 1.1% of all homicides have been of children under one year of age. Eight to nine percent (8%â€“9%) of all murders are of persons under 18 years of age. Of these, almost twice as many sons as compared to daughters are victims.<ref name=CrimeRep87>Uniform Crime Reports (1982-1987). U.S. Government Printing Office</ref> In half of the cases death occurs literally "at the hands of" the parent. Weapons are almost never used in neonaticide. Drowning, strangulation, head trauma, suffocation, and exposure (to the elements) are all common methods.<ref name=CrimeRep87 />

==Maternal Neonaticide==

90% of neonaticidal mothers are 25 years of age or younger. Less than 20% are married. Less than 30% are seen as psychotic or depressed<ref name=CrimeRep87 /><ref>Harder, T.: The Psychopathology of Infanticide. [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] 1967; 43: 196-245.</ref><ref>Turnbull, H.R.: Incidence of Infanticide in America: Public and Professional Attitudes. Issues in Law & Medicine 1986; 1: 363-389.</ref> They have typically denied and/or concealed the pregnancy since conception. They frequently give birth alone and dispose of the baby as an abortion that occurs "too late."
