'''Paralytic shellfish poisoning''' (PSP) is one of the four recognized syndromes of [[shellfish poisoning]], which share some common features and are primarily associated with [[Bivalvia|bivalve mollusks]] (such as [[mussel]]s, [[clam]]s, [[oyster]]s and [[scallop]]s). These shellfish are [[filter feeder]]s and, therefore, accumulate [[neurotoxin]]s, called [[Saxitoxin]], produced by microscopic [[alga]]e, such as [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[diatom]]s, and [[cyanobacteria]].<ref name=uhm>{{cite journal |author=Clark RF, Williams SR, Nordt SP, Manoguerra AS |title=A review of selected seafood poisonings |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=175–84 |year=1999 |pmid=10485519 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2314 |accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref> [[Dinoflagellate]]s of the genus ''[[Alexandrium]]'' are the most numerous and widespread saxitoxin producers and are responsible for PSP blooms in subarctic, temperate, and tropical locations.<ref>Taylor, F.

Also some pufferfish, including [[Chamaeleon puffer]], contain saxitoxin, making their consumption hazardous.<ref>{{cite doi |10.1016/j.toxicon.2007.10.002}}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==

The toxins responsible for most shellfish poisonings are water-soluble, heat and acid-stable, and ordinary cooking methods do not eliminate the toxins. The principal toxin responsible for PSP is [[saxitoxin]]. Some shellfish can store this toxin for several weeks after a [[harmful algal bloom]] passes, but others, such as [[Saxidomus|butter clam]]s, are known to store the toxin for up to two years. Additional toxins are found, such as neosaxiton and gonyautoxins I to IV. All of them act primarily on the nervous system.

PSP can be fatal in extreme cases, particularly in [[immunocompromised]] individuals. Children are more susceptible. PSP affects those who come into contact with the affected shellfish by ingestion.<ref name=uhm/> Symptoms can appear ten to 30 minutes after ingestion, and include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[abdominal pain]],  [[Paresthesia|tingling or burning]] lips, gums, tongue, face, neck, arms, legs, and toes.<ref name=uhm/> [[Dyspnea|Shortness of breath]], [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]], a choking feeling, [[Dysarthria|confused or slurred speech]], and [[Ataxia|loss of coordination]] are also possible.

==PSP in wild marine mammals==
PSP has been implicated as a possible cause of [[sea otter]] [[Death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] in Alaska, as one of its primary prey items, the butter [[clam]] ''(Saxidonus giganteus)'' bioaccumulates saxitoxin as a chemical defense mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=DeGange|first=AR|coauthors=Vacca MM|title=Sea otter mortality at Kodiak Island, Alaska, during summer 1987|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|year=1989|volume=70|issue=4|pages=836–838}}</ref> In addition, ingestion of saxitoxin-containing [[mackerel]] has been implicated in the death of [[humpback whales]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Geraci|first=JR|coauthors=Anderson DM, Timperi RJ, St. Aubin DJ, Early GA, Prescott JH, Mayo CA|title=Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) Fatally Poisoned by Dinoflagellate Toxin|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|year=1989|volume=46|pages=1895–1898}}</ref> 

Additional cases where PSP was suspected as the cause of death in [[Mediterranean monk seal]]s (''Monachus monachus'') in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hernandez|first=M|coauthors=Robinson I, Aguilar A, Gonzalez LM, Lopez-Jurado LF, Reyero MI, Cacho E, Franco J, Lopez-Rodas V, Costas E|title=Did algal toxins cause monk seal mortality?|journal=Nature|year=1998|volume=393|pages=28–29 | doi = 10.1038/29906}}</ref>  have been questioned due to lack of additional testing to rule out other causes of mortality.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Dolah|first=FM|title=Effects of Harmful Algal Blooms|journal=In: Marine Mammal Research: Conservation Beyond Crisis.
