'''Cysteine-rich secretory proteins''', often abbreviated as CRISPs, are a group of [[glycoprotein]]s<ref name = "dictionary" />. They are a subgroup of the CRISP, antigen 5 and Pr-1 ([[CAP protein family|CAP]]) [[Protein family#Terminology and usage|protein superfamily]] and are substantially implicated in the functioning of the [[mammal]]ian reproductive system.<ref name = "25-Oct-2010 review" /> CRISPs are also found in a variety of [[snake venom]]s where they inhibit both [[Muscle contraction#Smooth muscle contraction|smooth muscle contraction]] and [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s.<ref name = "Toxicon" />

== Structure ==

[[Glycoprotein]]s are [[conjugated protein]]s in which the non-protein group is a [[carbohydrate]] [[glycan]] &ndash; typically an [[oligosaccharide]] or small [[polysaccharide]], but occasionally a [[monosaccharide]].<ref>{{cite book|title = Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|editor1-last = Cammack|editor1-first = R.|editor2-last = Attwood|editor2-first = T.

CRISPs are glycoproteins in which the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]] is rich in the amino acid [[cysteine]]. Cysteine residues are typically oxidised to [[cystine]] in proteins, as the formation of [[disulfide bond]]s plays an important role in [[protein folding]] and the stabilisation of [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] &ndash; this is particularly important with [[secretory protein|proteins secreted]] to the [[extracellular]] medium<ref>{{Cite journal|last1 = Sevier|first1 = C.

However, CRISPs are atypical in that they often possess significant numbers of native (unoxidised) cysteine residues in addition to cystine residues involved in disulfide bonds.  The 
[[King Cobra]] venom [[ophanin]],<ref name="Yamazaki"/> for example, has 16 strictly conserved cysteines in addition to 8 disulfide bonds.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Cobra Venom Contains a Pool of Cysteine-Rich Secretory Proteins|year = 2005|last1 = Osipov|first1 = A.

== Mammalian reproduction ==

CRISPs are found in the [[testes]] and [[epididymis]] of mammals, and are also involved in the process of [[fertilisation]].<ref name = "dictionary">{{cite book|title = Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|editor1-last = Cammack|editor1-first = R.|editor2-last = Attwood|editor2-first = T.

CRISP2 also forms part of the [[sperm]] tail where it is thought to be involved in regulating [[flagellum|flagellar beating]]. Proteins [[CRISP1]] and [[CRISP4]] are both found in the epididymis where they are also incorporated within the spermatozoa as it matures. Protein [[CRISP3]] is found in [[seminal fluid]], excreted from the [[prostate]] although its function is presently unknown.<ref name = "25-Oct-2010 review">{{cite journal|last1 = Koppers|first1 = A.

During [[capacitation]], the penultimate stage of spermatozoa maturation, the acrosomal sperm head membrane is destabilised to allow greater binding between [[oocyte]] and sperm.  CRISP1 binds to surface of the sperm leading to a quiescent state of storage prior to capacitation. The mechanism is believed to involve inhibition of [[ion channel]] activity, similar to the mechanism of action of the other major function of CRISPs in [[snake venom]].<ref name = "25-Oct-2010 review" />  Research also suggests that CRISPs are involved in the oocyte-sperm binding needed for fertilisation.<ref name = "dictionary" />  Given the involvement of CRISPs in several stages of [[human reproduction]], it is unsurprising that applications in treatment of [[infertility]] and as [[contraceptive]]s are being actively investigated.<ref name = "25-Oct-2010 review" />
