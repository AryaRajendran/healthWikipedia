'''Medical slang''' is a form of [[slang]] used by [[Physician|doctors]], [[nurse]]s, [[paramedic]]s and other [[hospital]] or [[Medicine|medical]] staff. Its central aspect is the use of [[acronym]]s and informal terminology to describe patients, co-workers or situations. In some cases this is done in a derogatory manner. Medical slang can be found in numerous languages but in [[English language|English]], in particular, it has entered [[popular culture]] via television hospital/forensic dramas such as ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', ''[[Holby City]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House M.D.]]'', ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' and ''[[Green Wing]]''.

Medical slang comes in two forms: colloquial, but accepted, terminology used to describe medical professions, equipment, and diseases; and derogatory or pejorative language directed at fellow professionals and patients.  Examples of the former include ''bagged and tagged'' for the intake process at a [[mortuary]], ''blue pipes'' for [[vein]]s, a ''champagne tap'' for a flawless [[lumbar puncture]] (this is cause for [[champagne]] to be taken in celebration), and a ''cabbage'' for a heart bypass (''coronary artery bypass graft''); examples of the latter include ''ATFO'' for ''asked to fuck off'', ''bone break need fix'' for ''orthopaedic surgery'', and ''donorcycle'' for ''motorcycle''.

==Limitations on use==
In many countries, facetious or insulting acronyms are now considered unethical and unacceptable, and patients can access to their medical records. Medical facilities risk being sued by patients offended by the descriptions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  Another reason for the decline is that facetious acronyms could be confused with genuine medical terms and the wrong treatment administered.

In one of his annual reports (related by the BBC), medical slang collector Dr. Adam Fox cited an example where a practitioner had entered “TTFO”, meaning “told to [[wikt:fuck off|fuck off]]”, on a patient’s chart. When questioned about the chart entry, the practitioner said that the initials stood for “to take fluids orally.”<ref name="bbc">

</ref>  While this may or may not be true, it indicates the danger of using informal — and frequently insulting — acronyms.

As a result, medical slang tends to be restricted to oral use and to informal notes or [[Electronic mail|E-mails]] which do not form part of a patient’s formal records. It may also be used among medical staff outside of the hospital. It is not found on patients’ charts and, due to growing awareness of medical slang, often not used in front of patients themselves.

==Non-English==
Although online medical slang dictionaries are primarily from English-speaking countries, non-English medical slang has been collected by Fox from elsewhere. Brazilian medical slang includes ''PIMBA'' ("Pé Inchado Mulambo Bêbado Atropelado" meaning "swollen-footed, drunk, run-over beggar"), ''Poliesculhambado'' (multi-messed-up patient) and ''Trambiclínica'' (a "fraudulent clinic" staffed cheaply by medical students).<ref name="bbc" /><ref name="Peterson">{{cite journal |author=Peterson C |title=Medical slang in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil |journal=Cad Saúde Pública |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=671–82 |year=1998 |pmid=9878893 |doi=10.1590/S0102-311X1998000400002}}</ref>

==Annual round-up of medical slang==
There is an annual round-up of the usage of medical slang by British physician Dr. Adam Fox of [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]], [[London]]. Fox has spent five years charting more than 200 examples, regional and national terms and the general decline of medical slang. He believes that doctors have become more respectful of patients, which has contributed to the decline. While its use may be declining in the medical profession, several dictionaries of the slang have been compiled on the internet.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
