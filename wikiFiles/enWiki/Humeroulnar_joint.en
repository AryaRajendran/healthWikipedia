The '''humeroulnar joint''' ('''ulnohumeral''' or '''trochlear joint'''<ref name="Magee2008p361"/>), is part of the [[elbow-joint]]. It composed of two bones, the [[humerus]] and [[ulna]], and is the junction between the [[trochlear notch of ulna]] and the [[trochlea of humerus]].<ref name="Magee2008p361"/> It is classified as a simple [[hinge-joint]], which allows for movements of [[flexion]], [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] and [[Circumduction (anatomy)|circumduction]].<ref name="Loudon1998"/>{{pn|date=October 2012}} Owing to the obliquity of the trochlea of the humerus, this movement does not take place in the antero-posterior plane of the [[Body of humerus|body of the humerus]]. 

When the forearm is extended and [[Supination|supinated]], the axis of the [[arm]] and [[forearm]] are not in the same line; the arm forms an [[obtuse angle]] with the forearm, know as the [[carrying angle]]. During flexion, however, the forearm and the hand tend to approach the middle line of the body, and thus enable the hand to be easily carried to the face. 

The accurate adaptation of the trochlea of the humerus, with its prominences and depressions, to the trochlear notch of the ulna, prevents any [[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right (lateral), and medial|lateral]] movement. 

Flexion in the humeroulnar joint is produced by the action of the [[biceps brachii]] and [[brachialis]], assisted by the [[brachioradialis]], with a tiny contribution from the muscles arising from the [[medial epicondyle of the humerus]]. 

Extension in the humeroulnar joint is produced by the [[triceps brachii]] and [[anconeus muscle]], with a tiny contribution from the muscles arising from the [[lateral epicondyle of the humerus]], such as the [[extensor digitorum muscle]].
