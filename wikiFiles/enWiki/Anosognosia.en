'''Anosognosia''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|ˌ|n|ɒ|s|ɒ|g|ˈ|n|oʊ|z|i|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|æ|ˌ|n|ɒ|s|ɒ|g|ˈ|n|oʊ|ʒ|ə|}}) (uh no sog NOH zee uh<ref>http://www.stanford.edu/class/engr110/2012/03b-Jaffe.pdf</ref>) is viewed as a deficit of self-awareness, a condition in which a person who suffers certain [[disability]] seems unaware of the existence of his or her disability. The word comes from the Greek words ''nosos'', "disease", and ''gnosis'', "knowledge", with ''an-'' or ''a-'' as a negative prefix. It was first named by the [[neurologist]], [[Joseph Babinski]], in 1914.<ref name=Prigatano>{{cite book |author=Prigatano, George P.; Schacter, Daniel L |title=Awareness of deficit after brain injury: clinical and theoretical issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1991 |pages=53–55 |isbn=0-19-505941-7 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=xze89PCLaWMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA53}}</ref> Unlike [[denial]], which is a psychological [[defence mechanism]], anosognosia results from physiological damage on brain structures, typically to the parietal lobe or a diffuse lesion on the fronto-temporal-parietal area in the right hemisphere.<ref name="Moro 2011">{{cite journal|last=Moro|first=Valentina|coauthors=Pernigo, S., Zapparoli, P., Cordioli, Z., & Aglioti, S.

==Causes==
Relatively little has been discovered about the cause of the condition since its initial identification. Recent studies from the empirical data are prone to consider anosognosia a multi-componential syndrome or multi-faceted phenomenon. That is it can be manifested by failure to be aware of a number of specific deficits, including motor ([[hemiplegia]]), sensory (hemianaesthesia, [[hemianopia]]), spatial ([[unilateral neglect]]), memory ([[dementia]]), and language ([[receptive aphasia]]) due to impairment of anatomo-functionally discrete monitoring systems.<ref name="Moro 2011" /><ref name="Vallar 2006" />  Anosognosia is relatively common following different etiologies of brain injury, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury (e.g. 10%–18% in the case of anosognosia for [[hemiparesis]] with onset of acute [[stroke]]<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Incidence and diagnosis of anosognosia for hemiparesis revisited |date= 2005 March |author=B Baier and H Karnath |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=358–361 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2004.036731 |pmid=15716526 |pmc=1739568}}</ref>), but can appear to occur in conjunction with virtually any neurological impairment. It is more frequent in the acute than in the chronic phase and more prominent for assessment in the cases with right hemispheric lesions than with the left kinds.<ref name="Orfei 2009">{{cite journal|last=Orfei|first=M.D.|coauthors=Caltagirone, C., & Spalletta, G.|title=The evaluation of anosognosia in stroke patients|journal=Cerebrovascular diseases|year=2009|volume=27|issue=3|pages=280–289|doi=10.1159/000199466|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19202333|pmid=19202333}}</ref> However, it is not related to global [[mental confusion]], [[cognitive flexibility]], other major intellectual disturbance, or mere sensory/perceptual deficits. Anosognosia can be selective in that an affected person with multiple impairments may seem unaware of only one handicap, while appearing to be fully aware of any others.<ref>{{cite book |url= |title=Brain fiction: self-deception and the riddle of confabulation |first= William |last=Hirstein |pages=148 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-262-08338-8}}</ref> For example, anosognosia for hemiplegia may occur with intact awareness of visuo-spatial unilateral neglect, or vice versa. This phenomenon of double dissociation can be an indicator of domain-specific disorders of awareness modules, meaning that brain damage can selectively impact the self-monitoring process of one specific physical or cognitive function.<ref name="Moro 2011" /><ref name="Spinazzola 2008">{{cite journal|last=Spinazzola|first=Lucia|coauthors=Pia, L., Folegatti, A., Marchetti, C., & Berti, A.|title=Modular structure of awareness for sensorimotor disorders: evidence from anosognosia for hemiplegia and anosognosia for hemianaesthesia|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2008|volume=46|issue=3|pages=915–926|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.12.015|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18281065|pmid=18281065}}</ref><ref name="Vallar 2006" />

The condition does not seem to be directly related to [[senses|sensory]] loss and is thought to be caused by damage to higher level [[neurocognitive]] processes that are involved in integrating sensory information with processes that support spatial or bodily representations (including the [[somatosensory]] system).  Anosognosia is thought to be related to [[unilateral neglect]], a condition often found after damage to the non-dominant (usually the right<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=3452304 |title=Dissociation of anosognosia for hemiplegia and aphasia during left-hemisphere anesthesia |author=Breier J, Adair J C, Gold M, Fennell E, Gilmore R, Heilman K |journal=Neurology |volume=45 |issue=1 |date= April 20, 1995 |pages=65–7 |pmid=7824138 |doi=10.1212/WNL.45.1.65}}</ref>) hemisphere of the [[cerebral cortex]] in which sufferers seem unable to attend to, or sometimes comprehend, anything on a certain side of their body<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Possible mechanisms of anosognosia: a defect in self-awareness |author=K M Heilman, A M Barrett, and J C Adair |date=1998-11-29 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=353 |issue=1377 |pages=1903–1909 |pmid=9854262 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0342 |pmc=1692420}}</ref> (usually the left). There are also studies showing that the maneuver of [[Galvanic vestibular stimulation|vestibular stimulation]] could temporarily improve both the syndrome of spatial unilateral neglect and of anosognosia for left hemiplegia. Combining the findings of hemispheric asymmetry to the right, association to spatial unilateral neglect, and the temporal improvement on both syndromes, it is suggested there can be a spatial component underlying the mechanism of anosognosia for motor weakness and their neural processes could be modulated similarly.<ref name="Vallar 2006" /> There were some cases of anosognosia for right hemiplegia after left hemisphere damage, but the frequency of this type of anosognosia has not been estimated.<ref name="Moro 2011" />

Those diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease|dementia of the Alzheimer's type]] often display this lack of awareness and insist that nothing is wrong with them.

Anosognosia may occur as part of [[receptive aphasia]], a language disorder that causes poor comprehension of speech and the production of fluent but incomprehensible sentences. A patient with receptive aphasia cannot correct his own [[Phonetics|phonetic]] errors and shows "anger and disappointment with the person with whom s/he is speaking because that person fails to understand her/him." This may be a result of brain damage to the posterior portion of the [[superior temporal gyrus]], believed to contain representations of word sounds. With those representations significantly distorted, patients with receptive aphasia are unable to monitor their mistakes.<ref name=Prigatano /> Other patients with receptive aphasia are fully aware of their condition and speech inhibitions, but cannot monitor their condition, which is not the same as anosognosia and therefore cannot explain the occurrence of [[Jargon aphasia|neologistic jargon]].<ref name="Ellis,Miller,1983">{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Andrew W.|last2=Miller|first2=Diane|last3=Sin|first3=Gillian|title=Wernicke's aphasia and normal language processing: A case study in cognitive neuropsychology |journal=Cognition|volume=15|issue=1–3 |year=1983|pages=111–144 |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(83)90036-7|pmid=6686505}}</ref>

==Assessment==
Clinically, anosognosia is often assessed by giving patients an asnosognosia questionnaire in order to assess their metacognitive knowledge of deficits. However, neither the existing questionnaires applied in the clinics are designed thoroughly for evaluating the multidimensional nature of this clinical phenomenon nor the responses obtained via offline questionnaire are capable of revealing the discrepancy of awareness observed from their online task performance.<ref name="Marcel 2004">{{cite journal|last=Marcel|first=Anthony|coauthors=Tegner, R., & Nimmo-Smith, I.|title=Anosognosia for plegia: specificity, extension, partiality and disunity of bodily unawareness|journal=Cortex|year=2004|volume=40|issue=1|pages=19–40|doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70919-5|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15070001|pmid=15070001}}</ref><ref name="Orfei 2009" /> The discrepancy is noticed when patients showed no awareness of their deficits from the offline responses to the questionnaire but demonstrated reluctance or verbal circumlocution when asked to perform an online task. For example, patients with anosognosia for hemiplegia may find excuses not to perform a bimanual task even though they do not admit it is because of their paralyzed arms.<ref name="Marcel 2004" /> Similar situation can happen on patients with anosognosia for cognitive deficits after traumatic brain injury when monitoring their errors during the tasks regarding their memory and attention (online emergent awareness) and when predicting their performance right before the same tasks (online anticipatory awareness.<ref name="O'Keeffe 2007">{{cite journal|last=O'Keeffe|first=Fiadhnait|coauthors=Dockree, P., Moloney, P, Carton, S., & Robertson, I.

When assessing the causes of anosognosia within stroke patients, CT scans have been used to assess where the greatest amount of damage is found within the various areas of the brain. Stroke patients with mild and severe levels of anosognosia (determined by response to an anosognosia questionnaire) have been linked to lesions within the temporoparietal and [[Thalamus|thalamic]] regions, when compared to those who experience moderate anosognosia, or none at all.<ref name = "starkstein">{{cite journal|author=Starkstein, S., Fedoroff, J., Price, T., Leigurda, R., & Robinson, R. |title=Anosognosia in patients with cerebrovascular lesions.

==Psychiatry==
{{See also|Insight in psychology and psychiatry}}
Although largely used to describe unawareness of impairment after brain injury or stroke, the term 'anosognosia' is occasionally used to describe the lack of insight shown by some people who suffer from a mental illness such as bipolar disorder or [[psychosis]]. They do not have the insight to recognize that they suffer from a mental illness.  There is evidence that schizophrenic anosognosia may be the result of frontal lobe damage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pia L, Tamietto M |title=Unawareness in schizophrenia: neuropsychological and neuroanatomical findings |journal=Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=531–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16958934 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2006.01576.x }}</ref>

==Treatment==
In regard to anosognosia for neurological patients, no long-term treatments exist.  As with [[unilateral neglect]], [[caloric reflex testing]] (squirting ice cold water into the left ear) is known to temporarily ameliorate unawareness of impairment. It is not entirely clear how this works, although it is thought that the unconscious shift of [[attention]] or focus caused by the intense stimulation of the vestibular system temporarily influences awareness. Most cases of anosognosia appear to simply disappear over time, while other cases can last indefinitely. Normally, long-term cases are treated with cognitive therapy to train the patient to adjust for their inoperable limbs (though it is believed that these patients still are not "aware" of their disability). Another commonly used method is the use of feedback – comparing clients' self-predicted performance with their actual performance on a task in an attempt to improve insight.

[[Neurorehabilitation]] is difficult because, as anosognosia impairs the patient's desire to seek medical aid, it may also impair their ability to seek rehabilitation.<ref>Prigatano, G.P. (1991). ''Awareness of deficit after brain injury: clinical and theoretical issues''. New York, New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> A lack of awareness of the deficit makes cooperative, mindful work with a therapist difficult. In the [[acute]] phase, very little can be done to improve their awareness, but during this time, it is important for the therapist to build a [[therapeutic alliance]] with patients by entering their [[Phenomenology (science)|phenomenological]] field and reducing their frustration and confusion. Since severity changes over time, no single method of treatment or rehabilitation has emerged or will likely emerge.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=15668568|author=Prigatano, G.P.|year=2005|title=Disturbances of self-awareness and rehabilitation of patients with traumatic brain injury: A 20-year perspective|volume=20|issue=1|pages=19–29|journal=The Journal of head trauma rehabilitation }}</ref>

In regard to psychiatric patients, empirical studies verify that, for individuals with severe mental illnesses, lack of awareness of illness is significantly associated with both medication non-compliance and re-hospitalization.<ref name="Insight&Psychosis">{{cite book |author=McEvoy J |chapter=The Relationship Between Insight in Psychosis and Compliance With Medications |pages=299 |title=Insight and Psychosis |editor=Xavier F.

One study of voluntary and involuntary inpatients confirmed that committed patients require [[coercive]] treatment because they fail to recognize their need for care.<ref name="pmid2564330">{{cite journal |author=McEvoy JP, Applebaum PS, Apperson LJ, Geller JL, Freter S |title=Why must some schizophrenic patients be involuntarily committed?

Anosognosia is also closely related to other cognitive dysfunctions that may impair the capacity of an individual to continuously participate in treatment.<ref name="pmid2564330"/> Other research has suggested that attitudes toward treatment can improve after involuntary treatment and that previously committed patients tend later to seek voluntary treatment.<ref name="pmid6838317">{{cite journal |author=Kane JM, Quitkin F, Rifkin A, Wegner J, Rosenberg G, Borenstein M |title=Attitudinal changes of involuntarily committed patients following treatment |journal=Arch.
