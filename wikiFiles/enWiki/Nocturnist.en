A '''nocturnist''' is a [[hospital]]-based [[physician]] who only works overnight. Some nocturnists are trained in [[internal medicine]], and have experience in [[hospital medicine]]. However, there are nocturnists trained in other specialties, such as [[psychiatry]]. The main role of a nocturnist is to admit patients into the hospital from an [[emergency room]], and to care for previously admitted inpatients through the night.
