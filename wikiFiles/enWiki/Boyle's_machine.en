Medical grade [[oxygen]], [[nitrous oxide]] and [[inhalation anaesthetics]] can be administered to patients who are either breathing spontaneously or who have been paralyzed for the course of the surgical procedure using [[neuromuscular]] blocking drugs. Two breathing systems are usually present on the machine; one is the [[Magill's circuit]] or a universal [[Bain's breathing system]], and less commonly, a [[circle absorber]] using [[soda lime]] granules to remove [[carbon dioxide]] exhaled by the patient.

==History and Naming==

The British anesthesiologist Dr. [[Henry Edmund Gaskin Boyle]] is credited{{By whom|date=December 2009}} with designing the first anesthesia machine in 1917, hence the name. Henry Boyle was a pioneering anesthesiologist. Born in Barbados, he qualified [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]] [[Royal College of Physicians|LRCP]] from [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], London. He is best remembered{{By whom|date=September 2009}} for the development of early anesthetic machines. Even until recently, an anesthesia machine for administering general anesthesia would often be referred to as a "Boyle's Machine" in honor of his contribution in this field. His design included cylinders for medical oxygen, nitrous oxide and a "Boyle's Bottle" to vaporize [[diethyl ether]]. His other contribution to anesthesia included the Boyle-Davis gag, which is still used today during [[tonsillectomy]] operations.
