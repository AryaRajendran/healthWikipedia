'''Dental instruments''' are the [[tools]] that dental professionals use to provide dental treatment. They include tools to examine, manipulate, restore and remove [[teeth]] and surrounding [[mouth|oral]] structures.

Standard instruments are the instruments used to examine, restore and extract teeth and manipulate tissues.

==Examination instruments==
These tools allow the dental professional to manipulate tissues, to allow better visual access during treatment or during dental examination. 

===Mirror===
{{Main|Mouth mirror}}
Dental mirrors are used by the [[dentist]] or [[dental auxiliary]] to view a mirror image of the teeth in locations of the mouth where visibility is difficult or impossible. They also are useful for reflecting light onto desired surfaces, indirect vision, and with retraction of soft tissues to improve access or vision.

Dental handpieces come in many varying types which include: High speed air driven (also known as an airotor), slow speed, friction grip, surgical hand piece.
Straight handpiece with a sharp bur.

==Burs==
Dental Burs cutting surface are either made of a multifluted [[tungsten carbide]], a diamond coated tip or a stainless steel multi fluted rosehead.
There are many different types and classifications of burs some of the most common are: the round bur (sizes ¼ to 10) or inverted cone (sizes 33½ to 90L).
Burs are also classified by the type of shank. For instance a latch type, or right angle bur is only used in the slow speed handpiece with contra-angle attachment. Long shank or shaft is only used in the slow speed when the contra-angle is not in use, and finally a friction grip bur which is a small bur used only in the high-speed handpiece.

There are many bur shapes that are utilized in various specific procedures.

===Operative burs===
Flat fissure, pear-shaped, football, round, tapered, flame, chamfer, bevel, end cut,
bud bur, steel, inverted cone, diamond, brown stone, and greenstone.

==Restorative instruments==
===Excavators ===
*Spoon excavator: which is used to remove soft carious decay
*Half hollenbach: this instrument is usually used to test for overhangs or flash
*Chisels: 
**Straight - bevels the cavosurface margin and used in 3, 4 and 5 classifications of cavities on the maxillary.
**Wedelstaedt - only used in the anterior for classes 3, 4 and 5 as well.
**Bin Angle - this is held in a pen grasp and used for class 2 maxillary only.wheel shape bur
