'''"Jim"''' was the name to which a former milk wagon horse, who was used to produce [[blood plasma|serum]] containing [[antibody|antibodies]] against [[diphtheria|diphtheria toxin]], was trained to respond. Jim produced over 30 quarts (7.5 US gallons) of diphtheria [[antitoxin]] in his career. However, on October 2, 1901, Jim showed signs that he had contracted [[Clostridium tetani|tetanus]] and was [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]]. After the death of a girl in St. Louis was traced back to Jim's contaminated serum, it was discovered that serum dated September 30 contained tetanus in its incubation phase. This contamination could have easily been discovered if the serum had been tested prior to its use. Furthermore, samples from September 30 had also been used to fill bottles labeled "August 24," while actual samples from the 24th were shown to be free of contamination.{{fact|date=February 2013}}  

These failures in oversight led to the distribution of antitoxin that caused the death of 12 more children. This incident, and a similar one involving contaminated [[smallpox]] [[vaccine]], led to the passage of the [[Biologics Control Act]] of 1902, which established the [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]]. Jim's misfortune, and the ensuing tragedy and reaction, thus established a precedent for the regulation of biologics and thereby dressed the stage for the 1906 formation of the [[Food and Drug Administration]], or FDA.{{fact|date=February 2013}}
