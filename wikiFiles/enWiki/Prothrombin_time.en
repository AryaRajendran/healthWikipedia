The '''prothrombin time''' ('''PT''') and its derived measures of '''prothrombin ratio''' ('''PR''') and '''international normalized ratio''' ('''INR''') are measures of the ''[[extrinsic pathway]]'' of [[coagulation]]. This test is also called "ProTime INR" and "PT/INR". They are used to determine the clotting tendency of blood, in the measure of [[warfarin]] dosage, liver damage, and [[vitamin K]] status. PT measures factors [[fibrinogen|I (fibrinogen)]], [[prothrombin|II (prothrombin)]], [[Factor V|V]], [[Factor VII|VII]], and [[Factor X|X]].  It is used in conjunction with the [[partial thromboplastin time|activated partial thromboplastin time]] (aPTT) which measures the ''[[intrinsic pathway]]''.

==Laboratory measurement==
===Normal range===

The reference range for prothrombin time is usually around 12-16 seconds, and the INR in absence of anticoagulation therapy is 0.8-1.2. The target range for INR in anticoagulant use (e.g. [[warfarin]]) is 2 to 3. In some cases, if more intense anticoagulation is thought to be required, the target range may be 2.5-3.5.<ref>{{cite web |title=Warfarin Therapy Management in Adults|url=http://www.bcguidelines.ca/gpac/pdf/warfarin_management_summary.pdf }}</ref>

===Methodology===

The prothrombin time is most commonly measured using [[blood plasma]]. Blood is drawn into a [[test tube]] containing liquid [[citrate]], which acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then centrifuged to separate blood cells from plasma. In [[newborn]]s, a capillary whole blood specimen is used.<ref>Fritsma, George A. "Evaluation of Hemostasis." Hematology: Clinical Principles and Applications . Ed. Bernadette Rodak. W.B. Saunders Company: Philadelphia, 2002. 719-53. Print</ref>

The plasma is analyzed by a [[biomedical scientist]] on an automated instrument at 37°C, which takes a sample of the plasma. An excess of calcium is added (thereby reversing the effects of citrate), which enables the blood to clot again. For an accurate measurement the proportion of blood to citrate needs to be fixed; many laboratories will not perform the assay if the tube is underfilled and contains a relatively high concentration of citrate. If the tube is underfilled or overfilled with blood, the standardized dilution of 1 part anticoagulant to 9 parts whole blood is no longer valid. For the prothrombin time test the appropriate sample is sodium citrate tube, which is a liquid anticoagulant. 

[[Tissue factor]] (also known as factor III) is added, and the time the sample takes to clot is measured optically. Some laboratories use a mechanical measurement, which eliminates interferences from lipemic and icteric samples. The prothrombin ratio is the prothrombin time for a patient, divided by the result for control plasma.

===International normalized ratio===
The result (in seconds) for a prothrombin time performed on a normal individual will vary according to the type of analytical system employed. This is due to the variations between different batches of manufacturer's tissue factor used in the reagent to perform the test. The INR was devised to standardize the results. Each manufacturer assigns an ISI value (International Sensitivity Index) for any tissue factor they manufacture. The ISI value indicates how a particular batch of tissue factor compares to an international reference tissue factor. The ISI is usually between 1.0 and 2.0. The INR is the ratio of a patient's prothrombin time to a normal (control) sample, raised to the power of the ISI value for the analytical system used.

===Interpretation===
The prothrombin time is the time it takes [[blood plasma|plasma]] to clot after addition of [[tissue factor]] (obtained from animals such as rabbits, or recombinant tissue factor, or from brains of autopsy patients). This measures the quality of the ''extrinsic pathway'' (as well as the ''common pathway'') of [[coagulation]]. The speed of the ''extrinsic pathway'' is greatly affected by levels of functional [[factor VII]] in the body. Factor VII has a short [[half-life]] and the carboxylation of its glutamate residues requires [[vitamin K]]. The prothrombin time can be prolonged as a result of deficiencies in vitamin K, [[warfarin]] therapy, [[malabsorption]], or lack of intestinal colonization by bacteria (such as in [[newborn]]s). In addition, poor factor VII synthesis (due to [[liver disease]]) or increased consumption (in [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]) may prolong the PT.

The INR is typically used to monitor patients on warfarin or related oral anticoagulant therapy.  The normal range for a healthy person not using warfarin is 0.9–1.3, and for people on warfarin therapy an INR of 2.0–3.0 usually targeted, although the target INR may be higher in particular situations, such as for those with a [[artificial heart valve|mechanical heart valve]]. If the INR is outside the target range, a high INR indicates a higher risk of bleeding, while a low INR suggests a higher risk of developing a clot.

===Factors determining accuracy===
[[Lupus anticoagulant]], a circulating inhibitor predisposing for thrombosis, may skew PT results, depending on the assay used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Della Valle P, Crippa L, Garlando AM, ''et al.'' |title=Interference of lupus anticoagulants in prothrombin time assays: implications for selection of adequate methods to optimize the management of thrombosis in the antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome |journal=Haematologica |volume=84 |issue=12 |pages=1065–74 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=10586206|url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/reprint/84/12/1065 | format=PDF}}</ref> Variations between various thromboplastin preparations have in the past led to decreased accuracy of INR readings, and a 2005 study suggested that despite international calibration efforts (by INR) there were still statistically significant differences between various kits,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Horsti J, Uppa H, Vilpo JA |title=Poor agreement among prothrombin time international normalized ratio methods: comparison of seven commercial reagents |journal=Clin.

==Statistics==
An estimated 800 million PT/INR assays are performed annually worldwide.<ref name=Jackson/>

==Near-patient testing==
In addition to the laboratory method outlined above, near-patient testing (NPT) or home INR monitoring is becoming increasingly common in some countries. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, near-patient testing is used both by patients at home, and by some anticoagulation clinics (often hospital-based) as a fast and convenient alternative to the lab method. After a period of doubt about the accuracy of NPT results, a new generation of machines and reagents seems to be gaining acceptance for its ability to deliver results close in accuracy to those of the lab.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poller L, Keown M, Chauhan N, ''et al.'' |title=European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation. Correction of displayed international normalized ratio on two point-of-care test whole-blood prothrombin time monitors (CoaguChek Mini and TAS PT-NC) by independent international sensitivity index calibration |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=944–9 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=12956765 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04521.x}}</ref>[[File:CoaguChekXS with SoftClix and test strip.png|thumb|150px|A Roche CoaguChek XS.]]

In a typical NPT setup a small table-top device is used. A drop of capillary blood is obtained with an automated finger-prick, which is almost painless. This drop is placed on a disposable test strip with which the machine has been prepared. The resulting INR comes up on the display a few seconds later. A similar form of testing is used by people with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] for monitoring [[blood sugar]] levels, which is easily taught and routinely practiced.

Local policy determines whether the patient or a coagulation specialist (pharmacist, nurse, general practitioner or hospital doctor) interprets the result and determines the dose of medication. In Germany, patients may adjust the medication dose themselves,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} while in the UK and the USA this remains in the hands of a health care professional.

A significant advantage of home testing is the evidence that patient self-testing with medical support and patient self-management (where patients adjust their own anticoagulant dose) improves anticoagulant control. A meta analysis which reviewed 14 trials showed that home testing led to a reduced incidence of complications (bleeding and thrombosis) and improved the time in the therapeutic range, which is an indirect measure of anticoagulant control.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heneghan C, Alonso-Coello P, Garcia-Alamino JM, Perera R, Meats E, Glasziou P |title=Self-monitoring of oral anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9508 |pages=404–11 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16458764 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68139-7}}</ref>

Other advantages of the NPT approach are that it is fast and convenient, usually less painful, and offers, in home use, the ability for patients to measure their own INRs when required. Among its problems are that quite a steady hand is needed to deliver the blood to the exact spot, that some patients find the finger-pricking difficult, and that the cost of the test strips must also be taken into account. In the UK these are available on prescription so that elderly and unwaged people will not pay for them and others will pay only a standard prescription charge, which at the moment represents only about 20% of the retail price of the strips. In the USA, NPT in the home is currently reimbursed by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] for patients with mechanical heart valves, while private insurers may cover for other indications.Medicare is now covering home testing for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Home testing requires a doctor's prescription.

There is some evidence to suggest that NPT may be less accurate for certain patients, for example those who have the [[lupus anticoagulant]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moll, S and Ortel, TL. |title=Metering Warfarin Therapy in Patients with Lupus Anticoagulants. |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=127 |issue=3 |pages=177–185 |year=1997 |month=August |pmid=9245222}}</ref>

===Guidelines===
International guidelines were published in 2005 to govern home monitoring of oral anticoagulation by the International Self-Monitoring Association for Oral Anticoagulation.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Guidelines for implementation of patient self-testing and patient self-management of oral anticoagulation. International consensus guidelines prepared by International Self-Monitoring Association for Oral Anticoagulation| author=Jack Ansell| journal=International Journal of Cardiology| date=10 March 2005| url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T16-4CVR7GB-2&_user=10&_coverDate=03%2F10%2F2005&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=31d380c38e3d5afdba3f7dbb04e8b5b7| doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2003.11.008| pmid=15721497| volume=99| issue=1| pages=37–45}}</ref> The international guidelines study stated, “The consensus agrees that patient self-testing and patient self-management are effective methods of monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy, providing outcomes at least as good as, and possibly better than, those achieved with an anticoagulation clinic. All patients must be appropriately selected and trained. Currently available self-testing/self-management devices give INR results which are comparable with those obtained in laboratory testing.”

Medicare coverage for home testing of INR has been expanded in order to allow more people access to home testing of INR in the USA. The release on the 19th March 2008 said, “[t]he Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded Medicare coverage for home blood testing of prothrombin time (PT) International Normalized Ratio (INR) to include beneficiaries who are using the drug warfarin, an anticoagulant (blood thinner) medication, for chronic atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism.” In addition, “[t]hose Medicare beneficiaries and their physicians managing conditions related to chronic atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism will benefit greatly through the use of the home test.”<ref>{{cite web | title= Medicare expands coverage for home blood testing of prothrombin time international normalized ratio| publisher= The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] | date= 19 March 2008| url= http://www.cms.hhs.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=2987 }}</ref>

==History==
The prothrombin time was discovered by Dr Armand Quick and colleagues in 1935,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Quick AJ, Stanley-Brown M, Bancroft FW | title=A study of the coagulation defect in hemophilia and in jaundice | journal=Am J Med Sci | year=1935 | volume=190 | pages=501 | doi=10.1097/00000441-193510000-00009}}</ref> and a second method was published by Dr Paul Owren,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Owren PA, Aas K |title=The control of dicumarol therapy and the quantitative determination of prothrombin and proconvertin |journal=Scand.

It aided in the identification of the [[anticoagulant]]s [[dicumarol]] and [[warfarin]],<ref>{{cite journal| author=Campbell HA, Smith WK, Roberts WL, Link KP | title=Studies on the hemorrhagic sweet clover disease.

The INR was introduced in the early 1980s, by Dr. [[Jack Hirsh]] and colleagues at [[McMaster University]] School of Medicine, when it turned out that there was a large degree of variation between the various prothrombin time assays, a discrepancy mainly due to problems with the purity of the thromboplastin (tissue factor) concentrate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hirsh J, Bates SM |title=Clinical trials that have influenced the treatment of venous thromboembolism: a historical perspective |journal=Ann.
