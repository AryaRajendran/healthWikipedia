'''Mucormycosis''' is any fungal infection caused by fungi in the order [[Mucorales]].<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>{{rp|328}} Generally, species in the ''[[Mucor]],'' ''[[Rhizopus]],'' ''[[Absidia]]'', and ''[[Cunninghamella]]'' genera are most often implicated.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rinaldi M.G.|title=Zygomycosis|journal=Infect Dis Clin North Am|year=1989|volume=3|pages=19&ndash;41}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Lee F.Y.; Mossad S.B.; Adal K.A.|title=Pulmonary mucormycosis: the last 30 years|journal=Arch Intern Med|year=1999|volume=159|pages=1301&ndash;9|doi=10.1001/archinte.159.12.1301|pmid=10386506}}</ref>  This disease is often characterized by [[hypha]]e growing in and around vessels.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=ADA}}</ref>

"Mucormycosis" and "[[zygomycosis]]" are sometimes used interchangeably.<ref>Staff Springfield News-Leader (10 June 2011) [http://www.webcitation.org/5zLHMbxMN "Aggressive fungus strikes Joplin tornado victims"] Seattle PI, Hearst Communications Inc.</ref> However, [[zygomycota]] has been identified as [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]], and is not included in modern fungal classification systems.

Also, while Zygomycosis includes [[Entomophthorales]], mucormycosis excludes this group.

==Signs and symptoms==
Mucormycosis frequently involves the [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]], [[brain]], or [[lungs]] as the areas of infection. While oral or [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] mucormycosis are the most common types of the disease, this infection can also manifest in the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and in other organ systems.<ref name="Emedicine">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1513.htm |title= Mucormycosis |author= Nancy F Crum-Cianflone, MD MPH |publisher=eMedicine|accessdate=2008-05-19 |work=}}</ref> In rare cases, the [[maxilla]] may be affected by mucormycosis.<ref name="maxilla">{{cite journal |author=Auluck A |title=Maxillary necrosis by mucormycosis. a case report and literature review |journal=Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=E360–4 |year=2007 |pmid=17767099 |doi= |url=http://www.medicinaoral.com/medoralfree01/v12i5/medoralv12i5p360.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref> The rich vascularity of maxillofacial areas usually prevents fungal infections, although more virulent fungi, such as those responsible for mucormycosis, can often overcome this difficulty.<ref name="maxilla"/>

There are several key signs which point towards mucormycosis. One such sign is fungal invasion into the [[vascular]] network which results in [[thrombosis]] and [[necrosis|death]] of surrounding tissue by loss of [[blood supply]].<ref name="cmrasm"/> If the disease involves the [[cerebrum|brain]] then symptoms may include a [[unilateral|one-sided]] [[headache]] behind the eyes, facial pain, [[fever]]s, nasal stuffiness that progresses to black [[Mucopurulent discharge|discharge]], and acute [[sinusitis]] along with swelling of the eye.<ref name="medplus">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000649.htm |title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Mucormycosis |work= |accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref> Affected skin may appear relatively normal during the earliest stages of infection. This skin quickly progresses to an [[erythemic]] (reddening, occasionally with [[edema]]) stage, before eventually turning black due to necrosis.<ref name="cmrasm">{{cite journal |author=Spellberg B, Edwards J, Ibrahim A |title=Novel perspectives on mucormycosis: pathophysiology, presentation, and management |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=556–69 |year=2005 |pmid=16020690 |doi=10.1128/CMR.18.3.556-569.2005| url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/18/3/556 |pmc=1195964}}</ref> In other forms of mucormycosis, such as [[pulmonary]], [[cutaneous]], or disseminated mucormycosis, symptoms may also include [[dyspnea]] (difficulty breathing), and persistent [[cough]]; in cases of necrosis, symptoms include [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[hemoptysis|coughing blood]], and [[abdominal pain]].<ref name="Emedicine"/><ref name="medplus"/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Mature sporangium of a Mucor sp. fungus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This photomicrograph reveals a mature sporangium of a Mucor sp. fungus, which can be responsible for mucormycosis]]
As [[swab]]s of tissue or discharge are generally unreliable, the diagnosis of Mucormycosis tends to be established by a [[biopsy]] specimen of the involved tissue.

==Treatment==
If mucormycosis is suspected, prompt [[amphotericin B]] therapy should be administered due to the rapid spread and mortality rate of the disease. Amphotericin B (which works by damaging the [[cell wall]]s of the fungi) is usually administered for a further 4–6 weeks after initial therapy begins to ensure eradication of the infection. [[Posaconazole]] has been shown to be effective against mucormycosis, perhaps more so than amphotericin B, but has not yet replaced it as the standard of care. 

Liposonal drug is also available in the market, but this drug is very expensive.

After administration of either amphotericin B or Posaconazole, surgical removal of the "[[fungus ball]]" is indicated. The disease must be monitored carefully for any signs of reemergence.<ref name="Emedicine"/><ref name="HealthAtoZ">{{cite web|title=Mucormycosis|author=Rebecca J. Frey, PhD|url=http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/clients/haz/general/custom/default.jsp|publisher=Health A to Z|accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref> 

Surgical therapy can be very drastic, and in some cases of Rhinocerebral disease removal of infected brain tissue may be required. In some cases surgery may be disfiguring because it may involve removal of the [[palate]], [[nasal cavity]], or [[human eye#Three_layers|eye structure]]s.<ref name="medplus"/> Surgery may be extended to more than one operation.<ref name="Emedicine"/> It has been hypothesised that [[hyperbaric oxygen]] may be beneficial as an adjunctive therapy because higher oxygen [[pressure]] increases the ability of [[Neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]] to kill the organism.<ref name="cmrasm"/>

==Prognosis==
In most cases, the prognosis of mucormycosis is poor and has varied mortality rates depending on its form and severity. In the rhinocerebral form, the mortality rate is between 30% and 70%, whereas disseminated mucormycosis presents with the highest mortality rate in an otherwise healthy patient, with a mortality rate of up to 90%.<ref name="cmrasm"/> Patients with AIDS have a mortality rate of almost 100%.<ref name="HealthAtoZ"/> Possible complications of mucormycosis include the partial loss of neurological function, blindness and clotting of brain or lung vessels.<ref name="medplus"/>

==Epidemiology==
Mucormycosis is a very rare infection, and as such it is hard to note histories of patients and incidence of the infection.<ref name="Emedicine"/> However, one American oncology center revealed that mucormycosis was found in 0.7% of [[autopsy|autopsies]] and roughly 20 patients per every 100,000 admissions to that center.<ref name="HealthAtoZ"/> In the [[United States]], mucormycosis was most commonly found in rhinocerebral form, almost always with [[hyperglycemia]] and [[metabolic acidosis]].<ref name="pmid16080086"/> In most cases the patient is immunocompromised, although rare cases have occurred in which the subject was not; these are usually due to a [[Physical trauma|traumatic]] [[inoculation]] of fungal [[spores]]. Internationally, mucormycosis was found in 1% of patients with [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] leukemia in an [[Italy|Italian]] review.<ref name="Emedicine"/>

A cluster of infections occurred in the wake of the [[2011 Joplin tornado]]. As of July 19, a total of 18 suspected cases of cutaneous mucormycosis had been identified, of which 13 were confirmed. A confirmed case was defined as 1) necrotizing soft-tissue infection requiring antifungal treatment or surgical debridement in a person injured in the tornado, 2) with illness onset on or after May 22, and 3) positive fungal culture or histopathology and genetic sequencing consistent with a Mucormycete. No additional cases have been reported since June 17. Ten patients required admission to an intensive-care unit, and five died.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/us/11fungus.html?ref=health Rare Infection Strikes Victims of a Tornado in Missouri]</ref>

Cutaneous mucormycosis has been reported after previous natural disasters; however, this is the first known cluster occurring after a tornado. None of the infections were found in persons cleaning up debris; instead it is believed transmission occurred through penetrating injuries inflicted by contaminated objects (e.g. splinters from a woodpile). Health-care providers should consider environmental fungi as potential causes of necrotizing soft-tissue infections in patients injured during tornados and initiate early treatment for suspected infections.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6029a5.htm?s_cid=mm6029a5_e%0d%0aref= MMWR Weekly July 29, 2011 / 60(29);992]</ref>

Predisposing factors for mucormycosis include [[AIDS]], [[diabetes]], malignancies such as [[lymphoma]]s, [[renal failure]], [[organ transplant]], long term [[corticosteroid]] and immunosuppressive therapy, [[cirrhosis]] energy [[malnutrition]],<ref name="Emedicine"/><ref name="maxilla"/> and [[Deferoxamine]] therapy. Despite this, however, there have been cases of mucormycosis reported with no apparent predisposing factors present.<ref name="pmid16080086">{{cite journal |author=Roden MM, Zaoutis TE, Buchanan WL, ''et al'' |title=Epidemiology and outcome of Mucormycosis: a review of 929 reported cases |journal=Clin.
