'''Cysticercosis''' refers to tissue [[infection]] after exposure to [[egg (biology)|eggs]] of ''[[Taenia solium]]'', the pork [[tapeworm]]. The disease is spread via the [[fecal-oral route]] through contaminated food and water, and is primarily a food borne disease. After ingestion the eggs pass through the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the intestine into the tissues and migrate preferentially to the brain and muscles. There they form [[cysts]] that can persist for years. 
In some cases the cysts will eventually cause an inflammatory reaction presenting as painful nodules in the muscles and seizures when the cysts are located in the brain. Symptomatic disease from ''[[Taenia solium]]'' cysts in the brain is referred to as '''neurocysticercosis''' and is the most common tapeworm infection of the brain worldwide.<ref name="pmid12364377">{{cite journal |author=García HH, Evans CA, Nash TE, ''et al.'' |title=Current consensus guidelines for treatment of neurocysticercosis |journal=Clin. Microbiol.

Cysticercosis should be differentiated from [[taeniasis]]: carriage of the adult tapeworm in the intestine (which is through ingestion of cysts in an intermediate host, not the ingestion of the eggs as in cysticercosis). These represent two different stages of the parasite’s [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. Though both forms of infection can potentially occur in the same individual at the same time, they are distinct disease entities and have different treatments and potential outcomes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases, 7th ed. |last=Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett |publisher=[[Churchill Livingstone]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-443-06839-3|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

==Agent==
The cause of human cysticercosis is the egg form of ''Taenia solium'' (pork tapeworm), which is transmitted through the oral fecal route. ''T. solium'' is a member of Phylum Platyhelminthes, class Cestoda, Order Cyclophyllidea and family Taeniidae. The common larval stage of ''T. solium'' was also known as Cysticercus cellulosae.

==History of discovery==
[[File:Taenia solium scolex.JPG|thumb|260px|[[Scolex]] (head) of Taenia solium]]
The earliest reference to tapeworms were found in the works of [[ancient Egypt]]ians that date back to almost 2000 BC.<ref name="four">Wadia, NH, Singh, G. “Taenia Solium: A Historical Note” Taenia Solium Cysticercosis: From Basic to Clinical Science CABI Publishing, 2002. 157-168.</ref> The description of measled pork in the ''[[History of Animals]]'' written by [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) showed that the infection of pork with tapeworm was known to [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] at that time.<ref name="four" /> It was also known to Jewish<ref>Ancient Hebrew Medicine <http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/6309/1/Ancient-Hebrew-Medicine.html></ref> and later to [[Medicine in medieval Islam|early Muslim physicians]] and has been proposed as one of the reasons for pork being forbidden by [[Kashrut|Jewish]] and [[Islamic dietary laws]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Neurocysticercosis|last=Oscar H. del Brutto, Brutto Et Al|first=Julio Sotelo, Gustavo C. Román|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|year=1998|isbn=90-265-1513-8|page=3|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Recent examination of evolutionary histories of hosts and parasites and DNA evidence show that over 10,000 years ago, ancestors of modern humans in Africa became exposed to tapeworm when they scavenged for food or preyed on antelopes and bovids, and later passed the infection on to domestic animals such as pigs.<ref name="seven">http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/may01/worms0501.htm</ref>

An African cysticercosis research was allegedly referred to by [[Du Huan]] in the 8 c. China.{{fact|date=October 2012}}

Cysticercosis was described by Johannes Udalric Rumler in 1555; however, the connection between tapeworms and cysticercosis had not been recognized at that time.<ref name="five">Cox, F.E.G. “History of Human Parasitology” Clinical Microbiology Reviews. October 2002. 15(4) 595-612.</ref> Around 1850, [[Friedrich Küchenmeister]] fed pork containing cysticerci of ''T. solium'' to humans awaiting execution in a prison, and after they had been executed, he recovered the developing and adult tapeworms in their intestines.<ref name="four" /><ref name="five" /> By the middle of the 19th century, it was established that cysticercosis was caused by the ingestion of the eggs of ''T. solium''.<ref name="six">Küchenmeister, F. The Cysticercus cellulosus transformed within the organism of man into ''Taenia solium''. Lancet 1861 i:39.</ref>

==Transmission==
Humans are ''T. solium'' reservoirs. They are infected by eating undercooked pork that contains viable cysticerci. The cysticercus develops into an adult tape worm in the gut and produces large numbers of eggs which pass out in the feces. The presence of an adult tape worm in the gut is reasonably harmless.<ref name="test">Markell EK, John DT, Krotoski WA. Medical Parasitology Eighth Edition. Pennsylvania: Saunders, 1999.</ref> The condition known as cysticercosis in humans occurs due to the ingestion of tape worm eggs, either from external sources or from the person's own feces. The human has then become an accidental and "dead-end" intermediate host (that is, the infection can not progress any further).<ref name="test" /> Pigs, which are the "normal" intermediate host for this parasite, get infected with cysticerci when they ingest human feces. The incubation period ranges from months to over ten years.<ref name="three" />

==Morphology==
''T. solium'' worms may reach a length of several meters.<ref name="test" /> The scolex has four suckers, and a double crown of prominent hooks, which attach to the intestinal mucosa.<ref name="test" /> ''T. solium'' eggs are spherical and 30 to 40&nbsp;µm in diameter.<ref name="three">Davis, LE. “Neurocysticercosis” Emerging Neurological Infections edited by Power, C and Johnson RT. Taylor & Francis Group, 2005. 261-287.</ref>

The cysticercus larva completes development in about 2 months. It is semitransparent, opalescent white, and elongate oval in shape and may reach a length of 0.6 to 1.8&nbsp;cm.<ref name="test" />

==Life cycle==
[[File:Life cycle.gif|right]]
The life cycle involves humans as a definite host and pigs as an intermediate host. Pigs ingest contaminated food or water that contains eggs or proglottids from human feces. The eggs ([[ovum|ova]]) develop into cysticerci in pig muscles. Humans become infected when they ingest raw or undercooked pork that contain viable cysticerci. Upon reaching the small intestine, the scolex attaches to the intestinal wall and a proglottid chain grows. ''T. solium'' releases three to six proglottids/day, bearing 30,000 to 70,000 eggs per proglottid into the intestine. Nearly 250,000 ova are passed daily into the human feces and to the environment, and the cycle continues.<ref name="three" />
Infections with cysticercus occur after humans consume the ova from exogenous sources or through self-infection via the fecal-oral route. Humans, in this case, are intermediate hosts. Ova are digested in the stomach and release oncospheres which penetrate the intestinal wall and reach the bloodstream.<ref name="cdc">http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/cysticercosis/factsht_cysticercosis.htm.</ref> These oncospheres develop into cysticerci in any organ but are common in brain, subcutaneous tissue, or eyes.

==Clinical presentations in humans==
===Cysticercosis in muscles===
Cysticerci can develop in any voluntary muscle in humans.<ref name="test" /> Invasion of muscle by cysticerci can cause [[myositis]], with fever, [[eosinophilia]], and muscular pseudohypertrophy, which initiate with muscle swelling and later progress to atrophy and fibrosis.<ref name="test" /> In most cases, it is asymptomatic since the cysticerci die and become calcified.

===Neurocysticercosis===
The term neurocysticercosis is generally accepted to refer to cysts in the [[parenchyma]] of the brain. It presents with seizures and, less commonly, headaches.<ref name="pmid19836788">{{cite journal| author=Kerstein AH, Massey AD| title=Neurocysticercosis | journal=Kansas Journal of Medicine | year= 2010 | volume= 3| issue= 4 | pages= 52–4 | url=http://archie.kumc.edu/handle/2271/867 }}</ref> Cysticerca in brain parenchyma are usually 5-20 mm in diameter. In '''subarachnoid space''' and fissures, lesions may be as large as 6 cm in diameter and lobulated.

====Intraventricular neurocysticercosis====
Cysts located within the ventricles of the brain can block the outflow of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and present with symptoms of increased [[intracranial pressure]].<ref name="pmid18352801">{{cite journal| author=Suri A, Goel RK, Ahmad FU, Vellimana AK, Sharma BS, Mahapatra AK | title=Transventricular, transaqueductal scope-in-scope endoscopic excision of fourth ventricular neurocysticercosis: a series of 13 cases and a review. | journal=Emerg Radiol. | year=2008 Jan | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages =35–9 }}</ref>

====Racemose neurocysticercosis====
Racemose neurocysticercosis refers to cysts in the [[subarachnoid space]]. These can occasionally grow into large lobulated masses causing pressure on surrounding structures.<ref name="pmid16028320">{{cite journal| author=Hauptman JS, Hinrichs C, Mele C, Lee HJ | title=Radiologic manifestations of intraventricular and subarachnoid racemose neurocysticercosis. | journal=J Neurosurg Pediatr | year=2005 Apr | volume=11 | issue=3 | pages =153–7 }}</ref>

====Spinal neurocysticercosis====
Neurocysticercosis involving the spinal cord, most commonly presenting as back pain and [[radiculopathy]].<ref name="pmid20118838">{{cite journal| author=Jang JW, Lee JK, Lee JH, Seo BR, Kim SH. | title=Recurrent primary spinal subarachnoid neurocysticercosis. | journal=Spine | year=2010 Mar | volume=35 | issue=5 | pages=E172–5| doi=10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181b9d8b6| pmid=20118838 }}</ref>

===Ophthalmic cysticercosis===
In some cases, cysticerci may be found in the globe, [[extraocular muscles]], and subconjunctiva. Depending on the location, they may cause visual difficulties that fluctuate with eye position, retinal edema, hemorrhage, a decreased vision or even a visual loss.<ref name="test" /><ref name="three" />

===Subcutaneous cysticercosis===
Subcutaneous cysts are in the form of firm, mobile nodules, occurring mainly on the trunk and extremities.<ref name="eight">Wortman PD. “Subcutaneous cysticercosis” J Am Acad Dermatol. 1991 (2 Pt 2): 409-14.</ref> Subcutaneous nodules are sometimes painful.

==Diagnosis==
===Clinical===
The traditional method of demonstrating tapeworm eggs or [[proglottid|proglottids]] in stool samples diagnoses only taeniasis, carriage of the tapeworm stage of the life cycle.<ref name="cdc" /> Only a small minority of patients with cysticercosis will harbor a tapeworm, rendering stool studies ineffective for diagnosis.<ref name="pmid9886197">{{cite journal| author=HH Garcia, R Araoz, RH Gilman, J Valdez, AE Gonzalez, C Gavidia, ML Bravo, and VC Tsang | title=Increased prevalence of cysticercosis and taeniasis among professional fried pork vendors and the general population of a village in the Peruvian highlands. Cysticercosis Working Group in Peru | journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. | year=1998 | volume=59 | issue=6 | pages=902–905| pmid=9886197 }}</ref> Ophthalmic cysticercosis can be diagnosed by visualizing parasite in eye by [[fundoscopy]].

===Serological===
Antibodies to cysticerci can be demonstrated in serum by EITB (Enzyme Linked Immunotransfer Blot) assay and in CSF by ELISA. An immunoblot assay using lentil-lectin (agglutinin from Lens culinaris) is highly sensitive and specific. However, Individuals with intracranial lesions and calcifications may be seronegative. In the CDC’s immunoblot assay, cysticercosis-specific antibodies can react with structural glycoprotein antigens from the larval cysts of ''T. solium.''<ref name="cdc" /> However, this is mainly a research tool not widely available in clinical practice and nearly unobtainable in resource limited settings.
===Neurocysticercosis===
The diagnosis of neurocysticercosis is mainly clinical, based on a compatible presentation of symptoms and findings of imaging studies. 
====Imaging====
Neuroimaging with CT or MRI is the most useful method of diagnosis.<ref name="three" /> CT scan shows both calcified and uncalcified cysts, as well as distinguishing active and inactive cysts. Cystic lesions can show [[Ring-enhancing lesion|ring enhancement]] and focal enhancing lesions. Some cystic lesions, especially the ones in ventricles and subarachnoid space may not be visible on CT scan, since the cyst fluid is [[Radiodensity|isodense]] with CSF. Thus diagnosis of extraparenchymal cysts usually relies on signs like hydrocephalus or enhanced basilar meninges. In such cases CT scan with intraventricular contrast or MRI can be used. MRI is more sensitive in detection of intraventricular cysts.<ref name="three" />
====CSF====
CSF findings include [[pleocytosis]], elevated protein levels and depressed glucose levels; but these may not be always present.

==Management and therapy==
===Neurocysticercosis===
Neurocysticercosis most often presents as hydrocephalus and acute onset seizures, thus the immediate mainstay of therapy is emergent reduction of intracranial pressure and [[anticonvulsant]] medications. Once the seizures have been brought under control, antihelminthic treatments may be undertaken. The decision to treat with antiparasitic therapy is complex and based on the stage and number of cysts present, their location, and the patient's specific clinical presentation.<ref>{{cite journal|title=New developments in the management of neurocysticercosis|doi=10.1086/597758|year=2009|author=White, Jr., A. Clinton|journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases|volume=199|pages=1261|pmid=19358667|issue=9}}</ref> Antiparasitic treatment should be given in combination with [[corticosteroids]] and anticonvulsants to reduce inflammation surrounding the cysts and lower the risk of seizures. When corticosteroids are given in combination with praziquantel, cimetidine is also given, as corticosteroids decrease action of praziquantel by enhancing its [[first pass metabolism]]. [[Albendazole]] is generally preferable over [[praziquantel]] due to its lower cost and fewer drug interactions.<ref name="nine">Dimitrios K. Matthaiou, Georgios Panos, Eleni S. Adamidi,Matthew E. Falagas “Albendazole versus Praziquantel in the Treatment of Neurocysticercosis: A Meta-analysis of Comparative Trials” PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2008 March; 2(3): e194</ref> Praziquantel can evoke an inflammatory response in [[Central nervous system|CNS]] if hidden cystic lesion is present intracranially. [[Niclosamide]] can also be used.

Asymptomatic cysts, such as those discovered incidentally on neuroimaging done for another reason, may never lead to symptomatic disease and in many cases do not require therapy.

Calcified cysts have already died and [[Involution_(medicine)|involuted]]. Further antiparasitic therapy will be of no benefit.

Surgical intervention is much more likely to be needed in cases of intraventricular, racemose, or spinal neurocysticercosis. Treatments includes direct excision of ventricular cysts, shunting procedures, and removal of cysts via endoscopy.

===Ophthalmic cysticercosis===
In ophthalmic disease, surgical removal is necessary for cysts within the eye itself as treating intraocular lesions with anthelmintics will elicit an inflammatory reaction causing irreversible damage to structural components. Cysts outside globe can be treated with anthelmintics and steroids.<ref name="three" /> Treatment recommendations for subcutaneous cysticercosis includes surgery, praziquantel and albendazole.<ref name="eight" />

===Subcutaneous cysticercosis===
In general, subcutaneous disease does not need specific therapy. Painful or bothersome cysts can be surgically excised.

==Public health and prevention strategies==
Cysticercosis is considered as “tools-ready disease” according to WHO.<ref>WHO, “Global Plan to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases 2008-2015. World Health Organization 2007</ref> International Task Force for Disease Eradication in 1992 reported that cysticercosis is potentially eradicable.<ref name="thirteen">CDC, International Task Force for Disease Eradication, 1992. MMWR weekly. 1992. 41(37); 691, 697-698. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00017648.htm</ref> It is feasible because there are no animal reservoirs besides humans and pigs. The only source of ''T. solium'' infection for pigs is from humans, a definite host. Theoretically, breaking the life cycle seems easy by doing intervention strategies from various stages in the life cycle.<ref name="eleven">Schantz, P. “Eradication of ''T. solium'' Cysticercosis” International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases 2002. CDC. ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/infectious_diseases/iceid/2002/pdf/schantz.pdf</ref>

For example,
# Massive chemotherapy of infected individuals, improving sanitation, and educating people are all major ways to discontinue the cycle at Step 1, in which eggs from human feces are transmitted to other humans and/or pigs.
# Cooking of pork or freezing it and inspecting meat are effective means to cease the life cycle at Step 3.
# The management of pigs by treating them or vaccinating them is another possibility to intervene Step 4 of the life cycle.
# The separation of pigs from human faeces by confining them in enclosed piggeries. In Western European countries post World War 2 the pig industry developed rapidly and most pigs were housed. This was the main reason for pig cysticercosis largely being eliminated from the region. This of course is not a quick answer to the problem in developing countries.

===Intervention by concurrent treatment of humans and pigs===
The intervention strategies to eradicate cysticercosis includes surveillance of pigs in foci of transmission and massive chemotherapy treatment of humans.<ref name="thirteen" /> In reality, control of ''T. solium'' by a single intervention, for instance, by treating only human population will not work because the existing infected pigs can still carry on the cycle. The proposed strategy for eradication is to do multilateral intervention by treating both human and porcine populations.<ref name="fourteen">Gonzalez AE, García HH, Gilman RH, Tsang VCW, Cysticercosis Working Group in Peru. “Control of ''Taenia solium''” Acta Tropica 2003 87(1): 103-109.</ref> It is feasible because treatment pigs with oxfendazole have been shown to be effective and once treated, they are protected from further infections for at least 3 months.<ref name="fifteen">Gonzalez, A.E., Gavidia, C., Falcon, N., Bernal, T., Verastegui, M., Garcia, H.H., Gilman, R.H., Tsang, V.C., 2001.“Protection of pigs with cysticercosis from further infections after treatment with oxfendazole.” Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg.65, 15-18.</ref>

===Limitations===
Even with the concurrent treatment of humans and pigs, complete elimination is hard to achieve. In one study conducted in 12 villages in Peru, both humans and porcine were treated with praziquantel and oxfendazole, with the coverage of more than 75% in humans and 90% in pigs <ref>Garcia, H.H., 2002. “Effectiveness of an interventional control program for human and porcine ''Taenia solium'' cysticercosis in field conditions.” In: International Health. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, p. 250.</ref> The result shows a decreased in prevalence and incidence in the intervention area; however the effect did not completely eliminate ''T. solium''. The possible reason includes the incomplete coverage and re-infection.<ref>Gilman, R.H., Garcia, H.H., Gonzalez, A.E., Dunleavy, M., Verastegui, M., Peru,  T.C.W.G.I., 1999. Short cuts to development: methods to control the transmission of cysticercosis in developing countries. In: Garci´a, H.H., Marti´nez, M. (Eds.), ''Taenia solium'' taeniasis/cysticercosis. Editorial Universo, Lima,313-326.</ref> Even though ''T. solium'' could be eliminated through mass treatment of human and porcine population, it is not sustainable.<ref name="fourteen" /> Moreover, both tapeworm carriers of humans and pigs tend to spread the disease from endemic to non-endemic areas resulting in periodic outbreaks of cysticercosis or outbreaks in new areas.<ref>Margono, S.S., Subahar, R., Hamid, A., Wandra, T., Sudewi, S.S., Sutisna, P., Ito, A., 2001. “Cysticercosis in Indonesia: epidemiological aspects.” Southeast Asian J. Trop.

===Vaccine against porcine cysticercosis===
Given the fact that pigs are part of a life cycle, vaccination of pigs is another feasible intervention to eliminate cysticercosis. Research studies have been focusing on vaccine against cestode parasites, since many immune cell types are found to be capable of destroying cysticercus.<ref name="twenty">{{cite journal | author = Sciutto E, Aluja Fragoso G., Hernandez M, Rosas G. Larralde | year = 2008 | title = Vaccines Against Cisticercosis | url = | journal = Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 415–423 }}</ref> Many vaccine candidates are extracted from antigens of different cestodes such as ''T. solium'', ''T. crassiceps'', ''T. saginata'', ''T. ovis'' and target oncospheres and/or cysticerci. In 1983, Molinari et al. reported the first vaccine candidate against porcine cysticercosis using antigen from cysticercus cellulosae drawn out from naturally infected.<ref>Molinari J. L, Meza R, Suarez  B, Palacios S, Tato P, Retana A. 1983 “Taenia solium : immunity in hogs to the Cysticercus.”Exp. Parasitol 55: 340-57.</ref> Recently, vaccines extracted from genetically engineered 45W-4B antigens have been successfully tested to pigs in an experimental condition.<ref>Luo X, Zheng Y, Hou J, Zhang S, Cai X. 2009 “Protection against Asiatic ''Taenia solium'' Induced by a Recombinant 45W-4B Protein Clinical and Vaccine Immunology, 16 (2): 230-232.</ref> This type of vaccine can protect against cysticercosis in both Chinese and Mexican type of ''T. solium''. However, it has not been tested in endemic field conditions, which is important because the realistic condition in the field differ greatly from experimental condition, and this can result in a great difference in the chances of infection and immune reaction.<ref name="twenty" />

====The S3PVAC vaccine====
The vaccine constituted by 3 peptide synthetically produced (S3Pvac) has proven its efficacy in natural conditions of transmission.<ref name="Huerta M 2001">{{cite journal | author = Huerta M, De Aluja AS, Fragoso G, Toledo A, Villalobos N, Hernandez M, Gevorkian G, Acero G, Diaz A ''et al.'' | year = 2001 | title = Synthetic peptide vaccine against ''Taenia solium'' pig cysticercosis: successful vaccination in a controlled field trial in rural Mexico | url = | journal = Vaccine | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 262–6 }}</ref> The S3PVAC vaccine so far, can be considered as the best vaccine candidate to be used in endemic areas such as Mexico (20). S3Pvac consists of three protective peptides: KETc12, KETc1 and GK1, whose sequences belong to native antigens that are present in the different developmental stages of ''T. solium'' and other cestode parasites.<ref name="twenty" /><ref>http://www-lab.biomedicas.unam.mx/cistimex/s1.html#capitulo6</ref>

Non-infected pigs from rural villages in Mexico were vaccinated with S3Pvac and the vaccine reduced 98% the number of cysticerci and 50% the number of prevalence.<ref name="Huerta M 2001"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Sciutto E, Morales J, Martinez JJ, Toledo A, Villalobos MN, Cruz-Revilla C, Meneses G, Hernandez M, Diaz A ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Further evaluation of the synthetic peptide vaccine S3Pvac against ''Taenia solium'' cysticercosis in pigs in an endemic town of Mexico | url = | journal = Parasitology | volume = 134 | issue = | pages = 129–33 }}</ref> The diagnostic method involves necropsy and tongue inspection of pigs. The natural challenge conditions used in the study proved the efficacy of the S3Pvac vaccine in transmission control of ''T. solium'' in Mexico.<ref name="twenty" /> The S3Pvac vaccine is owned by the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the method of high scale production of the vaccine has already been developed.<ref name="twenty" /> The validation of the vaccine in agreement with the Secretary of Animal Health in Mexico is currently in the process of completion.<ref name="twenty seven">E-mail interview with Edda Sciutto. Feb 26 2009.</ref> It is also hoped that the vaccine will be well-accepted by pig owners because they also lose their income if pigs are infected cysticercosis.<ref name="twenty seven" /> Vaccination of pigs against cysticercosis, if succeeded, can potentially have a great impact on transmission control since there is no chance of re-infection once pigs receive vaccination.

====Limitations of vaccines====
Even though vaccines have been successfully generated, the feasibility of its production and usage in rural free ranging pigs still remains a challenge. If a vaccine is to be injected, the burden of work and the cost of vaccine administration to pigs will remain high and unrealistic.<ref name="twenty" /> The incentives of using vaccines by pig owners will decrease if the vaccine administration to pigs takes time by injecting every single pig in their livestock. A hypothetical oral vaccine is proposed to be more effective in this case as it can be easily delivered to the pigs by food.<ref name="twenty" />

===Other types of interventions and limitations===
Cysticercosis can also be prevented by routine inspection of meat and condemnation of measly meat by the local government.<ref>http://www.cwgesa.org/CWGESA%20Action%20Plan/CWGESA%20Action%20Plan.aspx</ref> However, in areas where food is scarce, cyst-infected meat might be considered as wasted since pork can provide high quality protein.<ref>CWGESA. 5th General Assembly of the Cysticercosis Working Group in Eastern and Southern Africa. 2007. CIRAD http://pigtrop.cirad.fr/sp/recursos/publications/procedimientos/5th_general_assembly_of_the_cysticercosis_working_group_in_eastern_and_southern_africa</ref> At times, infected pigs are consumed within the locality or sold at low prices to traffickers who take the uninspected pigs at urban areas for sale.<ref>Morales J, Martínez JJ, Garcia-Castella J,Peña N, Maza V, Villalobos N, Aluja AS, Fleury A, Fragoso G, Larralde C, Sciutto E. (2006) “Taenia solium: the complex interactions, of biological, social, geographical and commercial factors, involved in the transmission dynamics of pig cysticercosis in highly endemic areas” Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, 100(2) 123-135.</ref>

Due to these limitations, cysticercosis has not been eliminated in any endemic areas.

==Epidemiology==
The tapeworm that causes cysticercosis is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to many parts of the world including China, Southeast Asia, India, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America.<ref>Garcia HH, Gonzalez AE, Evans CA, Gilman RH. Cysticercosis Working Group in Peru. Taenia solium cystericercosis. Lancet 2003;362:547-556.</ref> Some studies suggest that the prevalence of cysticercosis in Mexico is between 3.1 and 3.9 percent. Other studies have found the [[seroprevalence]] in areas of Guatemala, Bolivia, and Peru as high as 20 percent in humans, and 37 percent in pigs.<ref>http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2008/04/cprl1-0804.html</ref> In Ethiopia, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo around 10% of the population is infected, in Madagascar 16%. The frequency has decreased in developed countries owing to stricter meat inspection, better hygiene and better sanitary facilities. The distribution of cysticercosis coincides with the distribution of ''T. solium''.<ref>http://www.who.int/zoonoses/diseases/taeniasis/en/index.html</ref> Cysticercosis is the most common cause of symptomatic [[epilepsy]] worldwide.<ref>International League Against Epilepsy. Relationship between epilepsy and tropical diseases. Epilepsia 1994;35:89-93.</ref>

In Latin America, an estimated 75 million persons live in endemic areas and 400,000 people have symptomatic disease.<ref>Bern C, Garcia HH, Evans C, Gonzalez AE, Verastegui M, Tsang VC, Gilman RH. “Magnitude of the disease burden from neurocysticercosis in a developing country.” Clin Infect Dis 1999 Nov 29 (5): 1203-9.</ref> Cysticercosis is also found to be associated with Hispanic ethnicity, immigrant status, and exposure to areas of endemicity.<ref name="test" /> In the US, the disease is found in immigrants from Mexico, Central and South America. Current livestock for pigs in the U.S do not play a role in the transmission of ''Taenia solium'', and thus cysticercosis in the U.S is an imported disease.<ref name="eleven" />

In the USA during 1990–2002, 221 cysticercosis deaths were identified. Mortality rates were highest for Latinos and men. The mean age at death was 40.5 years (range 2–88). Most patients, 84.6%, were foreign born, and 62% had emigrated from Mexico. The 33 US-born persons who died of cysticercosis represented 15% of all cysticercosis-related deaths. The cysticercosis mortality rate was highest in California, which accounted for ˜60% of all deaths.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/2/230.htm</ref>
