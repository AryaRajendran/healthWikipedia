==Career==
Studying and specialising in gynaecology at [[King's College London School of Medicine]], [[London]], he qualified as a doctor in 1930, and passed his membership exams for the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in 1932.

Between 1948 and 1967, Peel was director of clinical studies at King's College Hospital Medical School. He was an examiner at around a dozen British universities, including Oxford, Cambridge, London and Bristol.<ref name=TelgObit/>

Peel became a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] in 1944. In 1955 he became a member of its council, and in 1959 its honorary treasurer, there by raising suffiecent funds to allow the college to move into premises in [[Regent's Park]].

==Abortion Act 1967==
{{main|Abortion Act 1967}}
Whilst President of the RCOG, in 1967 Peel chaired the committee advising the [[British Government]] on what became the [[1967 Abortion Act]], accepting with the brief to reduce the amount of disease and death associated with illegal abortion. Introduced by the Liberal MP [[David Steel]], it proposed to legalise the medical termination of pregnancy. Both the ROCG council and government committee reflected the deep divisions surrounding this issue, including professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at [[University of Birmingham Medical School]] and a prominent anti-abortionist [[Hugh Maclaren]], as well as several [[Roman Catholic]]s. On publication of his advisory report, Peel won praise for his diplomatic skills as chairman of the government report committee, which came out in support of the Bill.<ref name=TelgObit/>

==Peel Report 1971==
Peel headed a number of steering groups and committees to government agencies, which included chairing the important '''Peel Report: Enquiry into Domiciliary Midwifery Beds Needs (1971)''' for the [[Department of Health and Social Security]]. To reduce maternal and infant mortality, the report recommended that all women should give birth in a hospital and remain there for some days. Among the Report's critics was epidemiologist [[Archie Cochrane]], who pointed out that there was little correlation between high hospitalisation rates and lower perinatal mortality. The report however resulted in a change in the medical establishment's approach to maternity, at the expense of domiciliary [[midwife]]ry services.<ref name=TelgObit/>

==Other works==
Peel was the author of Textbook of Gynaecology (1943); Lives of the Fellows of Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 1929-1969 (1976); and Biography of William Blair Bell (1986).<ref name=TelgObit/>

In the 1980s, as sponsor of the Responsible Society, Peel accused the [[Department for Education|Department of Education]] and the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] of encouraging girls under 16 to have sexual intercourse:<ref name=TelgObit/>
{{cquote|Young girls are the victims of exploitation by unscrupulous adults, by misleading information in popular teenage magazines; by pernicious theories from some 'trendy' experts; all leading to the glorification of sex for physical satisfaction alone.}}

==Personal life==
Peel was married three times: He married first, in 1936, Muriel Elaine Pellow, with whom he had a daughter; Freda Margaret Mellish in 1947. After Muriel death in 1993, he married Sally Barton in 1995. Peel was a keen gardener, owned a stock of [[Friesian cattle]] on his farm, and enjoyed [[Salmon fishing]] on the [[River Spey]] in [[Scotland]].<ref name=RCPE>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/publications/obituaries/2006/peel.php|title=Obituary: Sir John Peel|publisher=Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh|date=2 January 2006|accessdate=2012-12-22}}</ref><ref name=TelgObit>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1506770/Sir-John-Peel.html|title=Obituary: Sir John Peel|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=2 January 2006|accessdate=2012-12-22}}</ref>
