'''Luc Antoine Montagnier''' (born 18 August 1932 in [[Chabris]], Indre, France) is a French [[virology|virologist]] and joint recipient with [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]] and [[Harald zur Hausen]] of the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discovery of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV).<ref name="BBC_Nobel"/> A long-time researcher at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris, France, he currently works as a full-time professor at [[Shanghai Jiaotong University]] in China.<ref name="sjtu"/>

In 2009, Montagnier published two controversial research studies<ref name=Coghlan/> that some homeopaths claimed as support for [[homeopathy]]. Although Montagnier disputed any such support,<ref name="cbc">[http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2011/cureorcon/ Cure Or Con?] CBC Marketplace</ref> many scientists greeted his claims with scorn and harsh criticism.<ref name=Coghlan/><ref name=PZ_Myers/><ref name=NS_editorial/>

== History of the discovery of HIV ==
	
In 1982, [[Willy Rozenbaum]], a clinician at the ''Hôpital Bichat'' hospital in Paris, France, asked Montagnier for assistance in establishing the cause of a mysterious new [[syndrome]], AIDS (known at the time as "[[Gay-related immune deficiency]]" or GRIDS). Rozenbaum had suggested at scientific meetings that the cause of the disease might be a [[retrovirus]]. Montagnier and members of his group at the [[Pasteur Institute]], notably including [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]] and [[Jean-Claude Chermann]], had extensive experience with retroviruses. Montagnier and his team examined samples taken from Rozenbaum's AIDS patients and found the virus that would later become known as HIV in a [[lymph node]] [[biopsy]]. They named it "lymphadenopathy-associated virus," or LAV, since it was not yet clear that it was the cause of AIDS, and published their findings in the journal [[Science (journal)|Science]] in 1983.<ref name="Science4599"/>

A team led by [[Robert Gallo]] of the United States published similar findings in the same issue of Science and later confirmed the discovery of the virus and presented evidence that it caused AIDS. Gallo called the virus "human T-lymphotropic virus type III" (HTLV-III) because of perceived similarities with HTLV-I and -II, which had previously been discovered in his lab.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Popovic M, Sarngadharan MG, Read E, Gallo RC |title=Detection, isolation, and continuous production of cytopathic retroviruses (HTLV-III) from patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS |journal=Science |volume=224 |issue=4648 |pages=497–500 |year=1984 |pmid=6200935 |doi=10.1126/science.6200935|bibcode = 1984Sci...224..497P }}</ref> Because of the timing of the discoveries, whether Montagnier's or Gallo's group was first to isolate HIV was for many years the subject of an acrimonious dispute. HIV isolates usually have a high degree of variability because the virus mutates rapidly. In comparison, the first two human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates, Lai/LAV (formerly LAV, isolated at the Pasteur Institute) and Lai/IIIB (formerly HTLV-IIIB, isolated from a pooled culture at the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the [[National Cancer Institute]]) were strikingly similar in sequence, suggesting that the two isolates were in fact the same, or at least shared a common source.

In November 1990, the [[United States Office of Research Integrity|Office of Scientific Integrity]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] attempted to clear up the matter by commissioning a group at [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]] to analyze archival samples established at the Pasteur Institute and the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute between 1983 and 1985. The group, led by Sheng-Yung Chang, examined archival specimens and concluded in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1993 that Gallo's virus had come from Montagnier's lab.
Chang determined that the French group's LAV was a virus from one patient that had contaminated a culture from another. On request, Montagnier's group had sent a sample of this culture to Gallo, not knowing it contained two viruses. It then contaminated the pooled culture on which Gallo was working.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sheng-Yung P. Chang, Barbara H. Bowman, Judith B. Weiss, Rebeca E. Garcia & Thomas J. White | year=1993 | title=The origin of HIV-1 isolate HTLV-IIIB | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=363 | pages=466–469 | doi=10.1038/363466a0 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v363/n6428/abs/363466a0.html | issue=6428 | pmid = 8502298 |bibcode = 1993Natur.363..466C }} (Open access)</ref> 

Before the 1993 publication of Chang's results, Gallo's lab was accused and initially found guilty of "minor misconduct" by the Office of Scientific Integrity in 1991, and then by the newly created [[United States Office of Research Integrity|Office of Research Integrity]] in 1992 for the misappropriation of a sample of HIV produced at the Pasteur Institute.<ref name=sumf>{{cite web|url=http://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/unh_round1/www.unh.edu/rcr/Misconduct-FraudGoTo2.htm |title=Summary of fraud accusation |publisher=Ori.hhs.gov |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> The subsequent publication in 1993 of Chang's investigation cleared Gallo's lab of the charges, but his reputation had been unfairly tainted.

Today it is agreed that Montagnier's group first isolated HIV,<ref>{{cite web|last=Enserink |first=Martin |url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2008/1006/1 |title=Nobel Prize Surprise – ScienceNOW |publisher=Sciencenow.sciencemag.org |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> but Gallo's group is credited with discovering that the virus causes AIDS and with generating much of the science that made the discovery possible, including a technique previously developed by Gallo's lab for growing [[T cell]]s in the laboratory.<ref name=Morgan76>{{cite web|author=DA Morgan, FW Ruscetti, R Gallo |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/193/4257/1007 |title=Selective in vitro growth of T lymphocytes from normal human bone marrows |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=10 September 1976 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> When Montagnier's group first published their discovery, they said HIV's role in causing AIDS "remains to be determined."<ref name="science nobel">{{cite news | title= HIV, HPV Researchers Honored, But One Scientist is Left Out | work=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | month=October | year=2008 | volume=322 | pages=149–328 | url= }}</ref>

The question of whether the true discoverers of the virus were French or American was more than a matter of prestige. A US government patent for the AIDS test, filed by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] and based on what was claimed to be Gallo's identification of the virus, was at stake.<ref name="hilts">{{cite news | last = Hilts | first = Philip | title=U.S. Drops Misconduct Case Against an AIDS Researcher |work=New York Times | date = 13 November 1993 |url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F0CEFDB1F3BF930A25752C1A965958260}}</ref> In 1987, both governments attempted to end the dispute by arranging to split the prestige of discovery and the proceeds from the patent 50-50,<ref name="hilts"/> naming Montagnier and Gallo co-discoverers.<ref name="science nobel"/> The two scientists continued to dispute each other's claims until 1987. 
It was not until President [[François Mitterrand]] of France and President [[Ronald Reagan]] of the USA met that the major issues were ironed out. The scientific protagonists finally agreed to share credit for the discovery of HIV, and in 1986, both the French and the US names (LAV and HTLV-III) were dropped in favor of the new term ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (virus de l'immunodéficience humaine, abbreviated HIV or VIH) (Coffin, 1986). They concluded that the origin of the HIV-1 Lai/IIIB isolate discovered by Robert Gallo was the same as that discovered by Montagnier (but not known by Montagnier to cause AIDS). This compromise allowed Montagnier and Gallo to end their feud and collaborate with each other again, writing a chronology that appeared in ''Nature'' that year.<ref name="science nobel"/>

In the 29 November 2002 issue of ''Science'', Gallo and Montagnier published a series of articles, one of which was co-written by both scientists, in which they acknowledged the pivotal roles that each had played in the discovery of HIV.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Montagnier L | year = 2002 | title = Historical essay.

== Research on electromagnetic signals from DNA ==

In 2009, Montagnier published two controversial research studies which, if true, "would be the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 years, demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry."<ref name=Coghlan/>

They were published in a new journal of which he is chairman of the editorial board,<ref name=PZ_Myers/> allegedly<ref name=Coghlan/> detecting [[Electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic signals]] from bacterial [[DNA]] (''M. pirum'' and ''E. coli'') in water that had been prepared using agitation and high dilutions,<ref name=Montagnier_2009_v1_n2>Montagnier, L, Aäissa, J ''et al'', [http://www.springerlink.com/content/0557v31188m3766x/ "Electromagnetic Signals Are Produced by Aqueous Nanostructures Derived from Bacterial DNA Sequences"].

On 28 June 2010, Montagnier spoke at the Lindau Nobel laureate meeting in Germany,<ref name=Lindau>[http://www.lindau-nobel.org/PublicMeetingProgram.AxCMS?Meeting=278 Program (2010 – 60th Meeting of Nobel Laureates (3rd interdisciplinary))], Meeting on 28 June 2010</ref> "where 60 Nobel prize winners had gathered, along with 700 other scientists, to discuss the latest breakthroughs in medicine, chemistry and physics."<ref name=Australian/> He "stunned his colleagues....when he presented a new method for detecting viral infections that bore close parallels to the basic tenets of homeopathy. 
Although fellow Nobel prize winners – who view [[homeopathy]] as [[quackery]] – were left openly shaking their heads, Montagnier's comments were rapidly embraced by homeopaths eager for greater credibility....Cristal Sumner, of the [[British Homeopathic Association]], said Montagnier's work gave homeopathy 'a true scientific ethos'."<ref name=Australian>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/nobel-laureate-gives-homeopathy-a-boost/story-e6frg8y6-1225887772305 Nobel laureate gives homeopathy a boost.] ''[[The Australian]]'' 5 July 2010</ref> 

When asked by Canada's CBC ''Marketplace'' program if his work was indeed a theoretical basis for homeopathy as homeopaths had claimed, Montagnier replied that one "cannot extrapolate it to the products used in homeopathy".<ref name="cbc" />

=== Responses, criticisms and interview ===

While homeopaths claim his research as support for homeopathy, many scientists have greeted it with scorn and harsh criticism.<ref name=Coghlan/><ref name=PZ_Myers/><ref name=NS_editorial/>

Because the research used high dilutions, homeopaths claimed it supported homeopathy, even though it didn't mention homeopathy or use [[Homeopathy#High dilutions|ultra-high dilutions]]:

: On 14 September 2009, Louise Mclean posted on the "Homeopathy World Community" website: "Luc Montagnier Foundation Proves Homeopathy Works",<ref name=Mclean>[http://www.homeopathyworldcommunity.com/group/latesthomeopathynews/forum/topics/luc-montagnier-foundation "Luc Montagnier Foundation Proves Homeopathy Works"]. "Homeopathy World Community" website, 14 September 2009</ref> and on 6 October 2009, homeopathic promoter [[Dana Ullman]] responded to a criticism of homeopathy by writing: "And I assume that you all have seen the new research by Nobel Prize-winning virologist Luc Montagnier that provides significant support to homeopathy."<ref name=Ullman_SBM>[[Dana Ullman]], [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2005 Dana Ullman's comment of 6 October 2009]</ref> (On 30 January 2011, Ullman responded to Montagnier's comment on "homeopathy" and "high dilutions" in his 24 December 2010 ''Science'' interview by writing an article entitled "Luc Montagnier, Nobel Prize Winner, Takes Homeopathy Seriously". In the article he repeated his claim's that Montagnier's studies supported homeopathy.<ref name=Ullman>[[Dana Ullman]], [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/luc-montagnier-homeopathy-taken-seriously_b_814619.html "Luc Montagnier, Nobel Prize Winner, Takes Homeopathy Seriously"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 30 January 2011</ref>)

Criticism of the claims of homeopaths followed:

: On 20 October 2010, [[Harriet A. Hall]] responded specifically to these claims by homeopaths: "Nope. Sorry, guys. It doesn’t. In fact, its findings are inconsistent with homeopathic theory... Homeopaths who believe Montagnier’s study supports homeopathy are only demonstrating their enormous capacity for self-deception." She went on to analyze the studies and pointed out a number of flaws, stating: "...even assuming the results are valid, they tend to discredit homeopathy, not support it...Homeopathy is a system of clinical treatment that can only be validated by ''in vivo'' clinical trials."<ref name=Hall>[[Harriet A. Hall]], [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2081 "The Montagnier 'Homeopathy' Study"], ''Science-Based Medicine'', 20 October 2009</ref>

In a 24 December 2010 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine interview entitled "French Nobelist Escapes ‘Intellectual Terror’ to Pursue Radical Ideas in China", he was questioned about his research and plans. In the interview he stated that [[Jacques Benveniste]], whose controversial [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] work had been discredited, was "a modern [[Galileo]]". When asked if he wasn't "worried that your colleagues will think you have drifted into pseudo-science?", he replied "No, because it’s not [[pseudoscience]]. It’s not [[quackery]]. 
These are real phenomena which deserve further study." He also mentioned that his applications for funding had been turned down and that he was leaving his home country to set up shop in China so he could escape what he called the "intellectual terror" which he had been told had prevented others from publishing their results. 
He believes that China's Jiaotong University is more "open minded" to his research. There he is chairman of the editorial board<ref name=PZ_Myers/><ref name=ISCLS_board>[http://www.springer.com/life+sciences/bioinformatics/journal/12539?detailsPage=editorialBoard Montagnier is listed as Chairman of the Editorial Board] of the journal ''[[Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences]]''</ref> of a new journal which publishes his research.<ref name=Enserink/>

He was also questioned on his beliefs about homeopathy, to which he replied: "I can’t say that homeopathy is right in everything. What I can say now is that the high dilutions are right. High dilutions of something are not nothing. They are water structures which mimic the original molecules." He did admit that he wasn't working with the very high dilution levels normally used in homeopathy: "We ﬁnd that with DNA, we cannot work at the extremely high dilutions used in homeopathy; we cannot go further than a 10<sup>−18</s> dilution, or we lose the signal. 
But even at 10<sup>−18</s>, you can calculate that there is [[Avogadro constant|not a single molecule of DNA left]]. And yet we detect a signal."<ref name=Enserink>Martin Enserink, [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6012/1732.summary "Newsmaker Interview: Luc Montagnier. French Nobelist Escapes "Intellectual Terror" to Pursue Radical Ideas in China"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' 24 December 2010: 1732. {{doi|10.1126/science.330.6012.1732}} [http://www.scribd.com/doc/47426344/Luc-Montagnier-French-Nobelist-on-homeopathy Full article mirror]</ref>

A 12 January 2011 ''[[New Scientist]]'' editorial described the controversial nature of the research, while also noting how many researchers "reacted with disbelief", with [[Gary Schuster]] comparing it to "[[pathological science]]."<ref name=Coghlan/> Biology professor [[PZ Myers]] also described it as "pathological science." He described the paper as "one of the more unprofessional write-ups I've ever run across", and criticized the publication process as having an "unbelievable turnaround" time: "another suspicious sign are the dates. This paper was submitted on 3 January 2009, revised on 5 January 2009, and accepted on 6 January 2009," leading him to ask: "Who reviewed this, the author's mother? Maybe someone even closer. Guess who the chairman of the editorial board is: Luc Montagnier."<ref name=PZ_Myers/><ref name=ISCLS_board/>

On 25 May 2012, he gave the keynote address<ref name=AO2012/> at the 2012 AutismOne conference in Chicago.  Similar to the controversy he aroused by extolling homeopathy, his latest group, Chronimed, claims to have made a discovery for autistic children that was sharply criticized<ref name=Forbes/> by scientist [[Steven Salzberg|Dr. Steven Salzberg]].

=== Legal battle over patent ===

In 2009, Montagnier became involved in a legal battle with inventor Bruno Robert over the intellectual property rights to the techniques used in the aforementioned research. Robert, who had tried to succeed the company Digibio created by the late Jacques Benveniste, approached Montagnier in May 2005 regarding his work on electromagnetic signals. 
In November 2005, Robert registered a patent for the process of homing in on a "biochemical element presenting a biological activity through the analysis of low-frequency electromagnetic signals." This patent was in fact written by Montagnier from results obtained between July and November 2005.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} A month later, [[Institut national de la propriété industrielle|INPI]], France's patents body, received a request for the same patent from Montagnier,<ref name=Montagnier_patent>{{cite web|url=http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=WO&NR=2007068831A2&KC=A3&FT=D&date=20070809&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP |title=Montagnier's patent application |publisher=V3.espacenet.com |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> which was criticized by the patent examiner on multiple points, including this one:

: "...the invention is based on phenomena which contradict the fundamental principle of physics and of chemistry, i.e. the existence of biological or effect without an active molecule and no explanation or theoretical basis makes it impossible at the current time to explain the results obtained."<ref name=patent_examiner>[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wads.jsp?IA=FR2006002735&LANGUAGE=EN&ID=id00000006560269&VOL=89&DOC=000162&WO=07/068831&WEEK=NA&TYPE=NA&DOC_TYPE=ETWOS&PAGE=10 Patent examiner's assessment, p. 10]. ''[[World Intellectual Property Organization]]'' (WIPO), United Nations</ref><!--- The WIPO website's download of this document can be slow and sometimes it only downloads the first of the eleven pages.

Montagnier took Robert to court, claiming that he had intellectual property rights over this process. However, Robert's lawyer alleged that Montagnier had already admitted that he had not come up with the discovery, as he had signed a contract to use Robert's technique in 2005.
In response, Montagnier's lawyer said the pair had only signed a "protocol agreement" which was not legally binding.<ref name="bruno_case">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/4959505/Man-who-co-discovered-HIV-accused-of-stealing-rights-to-Aids-cure.html|last=Samuel|first=Henry|date=8 Mar 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=4 August 2009 | location=London | title=Man who co-discovered HIV accused of stealing rights to Aids cure}}</ref> In July 2009, the court ruled that Robert's 2005 patent application was 'fraudulent', because it had subtracted all of Montagnier's contribution, which the court estimated at 50%.<ref>http://www.lematin.ch/flash-info/luc-montagnier-gagne-proces-paternite-brevets-contre-bruno-robert {{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>
