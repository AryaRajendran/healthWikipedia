A '''urethrocele''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|j|ʊ|ˈ|r|iː|θ|r|ɵ|s|iː|l}} {{respell|yew|REE|thrə-seel}}) is the [[prolapse]] of the female [[urethra]] into the [[vagina]]. Weakening of the tissues that hold the urethra in place cause it to move and to put pressure on the vagina, leading to the descent of the [[anterior]] [[distal]] wall of the vagina.<ref name="JC">{{cite web

==Cause==
Urethroceles are often caused by childbirth, the movement of the baby through the vagina causing damage to the surrounding tissues.<ref name="Webmd" /> When they occur in women who have never had children, they may be the result of a [[congenital]] weakness in the tissues of the [[pelvic floor]].<ref>{{cite book
