'''Toxinology''' is the specialized area of [[science]] that deals specifically with animal, [[Plant toxin|plant]], and [[microbial toxins]]. Toxinology has been defined as "the scientific discipline dealing with microbial, plant and animal [[venom]]s, [[poison]]s and [[toxin]]s".<ref name="autogenerated2">Mebs D (2002) Venomous and Poisonous Animals. CRC Press:Boca Raton. pg. 2</ref> "Toxinology includes more than just the [[chemistry]] and [[mode of action]] of a toxin. It deals also with the biology of venom- or poison-producing organism, the structure and function of the venom apparatus, as well as the use of the venom or poison, the ecological role of these compounds".<ref name="autogenerated2"/> Toxinology has also been defined as "the science of toxic substances produced by or accumulated in living organisms, their properties, and their biological significance for the organisms involved".<ref>Meier J & White J (1995) Handbook of Clinical Toxicology of Animal Venoms and Poisons. CRC Press:Boca Raton</ref>

There is an [[International Society on Toxinology]] (IST), founded in 1962, organizing an international congress every three years and regional sectional meetings in intervening years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toxinology.org |title=Ist Website Home Page |publisher=Toxinology.org |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref> The IST has, or is in the process of adopting several key initiatives, notably regularising toxin [[nomenclature]] (through work of an expert committee), developing the field of clinical toxinology as a global [[training]] and [[accreditation]] initiative, and supporting efforts to reduce the global toll from [[snakebite]], through the Global Snakebite Initiative. Details of these and other activities, including a Society electronic [[newsletter]] are available via the Society web site at www.toxinology.org. The society also has an official journal, ''[[Toxicon]]''. A number of countries have established national toxinology societies and these hold national meetings. There are several journals, besides ''Toxicon'', that principally cover toxin research and major discoveries in toxinology can be published in a wide variety of journals, including [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']].

==Toxins and toxinology==
Toxins are natural substances, or substances produced by [[living organism]]s, in contrast to toxic substances from [[chemical]]s, which are [[toxicant]]s.  Living organisms producing or using toxins do so as either venoms or poisons. Venoms are toxins, or more commonly, collections of varying toxins, that are used actively against [[prey]] or [[predator]]s, most commonly to subdue, kill and digest prey, or dissuade predators.  Poisons of natural origin, that is containing toxins and used by living organisms, are passive and generally used for defence.  A predator attempting to molest or eat a poisonous [[animal]], [[plant]] or [[mushroom]] will suffer adverse effects from the toxins in the poison, varying from mild discomfort to rapid death.  Particularly [[Food poisoning|food poisons]], but also for a few venoms, the component toxins are not produced by the deploying animal/plant, but are made by [[micro-organism]]s and concentrated and used by the deploying animal/plant.  A good example is [[tetrodotoxin]], used by a variety of poisonous animals and by a few venomous animals. 

Toxins and toxinology is not solely focused on adverse effects. An increasing number of toxins are important as research tools, unlocking secrets of [[disease]], or as diagnostic agents in hospital laboratories, or as therapeutic agents to treat human disease, including [[Anti-cancer drug|anti-cancer agents]], [[Anti-epileptic drugs|anti-epileptic agents]], anti-clotting agents, [[analgesic]]s, [[anti-hypertensive]] drugs, to name but a few.  This is a very rich field for research.

Venomous animals can be found in a number of [[Phylum|Phyla]]. Some prominent examples include: Phylum [[Chordata]], [[Subphylum]] [[Vertebrata]] - [[venomous snake]]s (approximately 800 species in Families [[Viperidae]], [[Elapidae]], [[Atractaspididae]] and [[Colubridae]]* (* this family is an artificial construct and will likely be broken up into a variety of new families)), venomous lizards (two species from the [[Americas]] - [[Heloderma horridum]] and [[Heloderma suspectum|H. suspectum]]; also recent controversial research has claimed some other lizards can produce toxins, notably [[varanid]] lizards), [[venomous mammals]] (notably the [[platypus]], also some [[shrew]] species), venomous spiny fish (e.g. [[stonefish]], butterfly cod, [[bullrout]], [[catfish]], numerous other species), [[stingray]]s. Phylum [[Arthropoda]] - [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[tick]]s (only a few species are venomous, causing [[paralysis]]), [[centipede]]s, some [[insect]]s (notably the [[hymenoptera]]ns including [[bee]]s, [[wasp]]s and [[ant]]s). Phylum [[Mollusca]] - [[cone snail]]s and related predatory [[marine snail]]s, some [[octopus]]es (notably the [[blue-ringed octopus]]). Phylum [[Cnidaria]] ([[Coelenterata]]) - true [[jellyfish]], [[box jellyfish]] (contains some of the most lethal of all venomous animals), [[hydrozoa]]ns (includes colony "jellyfish" such as [[Physalia]] or [[Portuguese Man O' War]]), [[anthozoa]]ns (including [[coral]]). Phylum [[Echinodermata]] - [[sea urchin]]s. This listing is not exhaustive.

Poisonous animals, mushrooms and plants again cover a diversity of taxonomic groups. In many cases, poisonous animals derive their poison from the environment. This applies to classic marine poisons such as [[fugu]] (tetrodotoxin), [[ciguatera]], and the several distinct types of [[shellfish]] poisons. In many cases the prime toxin producer is a [[dinoflagellate]]. Conversely, mushroom and plant toxins are produced by the organism itself. Plant toxins have long been recognised as poisons, but also as therapeutic agents, if used in the correct dose. A classic example is [[digitalis]], long used as treatment for certain [[heart disease|heart conditions]]. Nevertheless, some plant toxins have become "popular" as [[self-harm]] agents, used in [[suicide]]s. Mushroom toxins include some lethal toxins that can cause painful, drawn out death.

==Clinical toxinology==
Within toxinology there is a clinical subgroup, clinical toxinologists, who focus on the medical effects in humans of exposure to the toxins in animal venoms or plant poisons.  This includes such problems as venomous snakebite, currently considered to afflict >2.5 million people each year, with >100,000 deaths. Information on these medical consequences of toxins can be found in diverse sources, such as the Clinical Toxinology Resources Website and books such as Prof. Mebs book and the CRC book on toxinology. Clinical toxinology does not, yet, enjoy specialist status within medicine, unlike fields such as [[surgery]] and [[radiology]]. However, a training course in clinical toxinology has existed since 1997 (held in [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]]) and efforts are under way to expand this to a true, specialist-level international training program, through an initiative of the International Society on Toxinology. Given the huge impact of toxin-based disease globally, the value of having doctors expert in this area is self-evident.
