==Book and film==
Esselstyn is the author of the 2007 text, ''Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease'', in which he discusses his patients' reversals of [[atherosclerosis]] by following a no-oil, whole foods, plant-based ([[vegan]]) diet, in some cases combined with cholesterol-lowering medication.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/08/19/heart.attack.proof.diet/index.html The 'heart attack proof' diet?]</ref> The second half of the book contains recipes from his wife Ann Crile Esselstyn (the granddaughter of [[George Washington Crile]], founder of the [[Cleveland Clinic]]) who works with him to counsel patients on cooking practices. Esselstyn and his family of four children have maintained a plant-based diet since the mid-1980s.<ref name="about">{{cite web |url=http://www.heartattackproof.com/about.htm |title=About Dr. Esselstyn}}</ref> Esselstyn attributes the success of his twelve-year trial with heart patients to low mean levels of both total cholesterol (145&nbsp;mg/dl) and LDL cholesterol (82&nbsp;mg/dl).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heartattackproof.com/news_info.htm |title=CLEVELAND CLINIC STUDY STOPS PROGRESS OF HEART DISEASE WITH DIET AND CHOLESTEROL DRUGS |publisher=August 1, 1999 issue of The American Journal of Cardiology |accessdate=17 April 2010 }}</ref>  

After undergoing cardiac surgery in 2010, former American president [[Bill Clinton]] adopted the plant-based diet recommended by [[Dean Ornish]] and Esselstyn.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/08/18/bill.clinton.diet.vegan/index.html From omnivore to vegan: The dietary education of Bill Clinton]</ref><ref>[http://www.vegsource.com/news/2010/09/cnn-interviews-caldwell-esselstyn-md-dean-ornish-md-about-bill-clintons-plant-based-diet.html Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. MD & Dean Ornish MD Explain Bill Clinton's Diet To CNN]</ref>

Esselstyn stars in the 2011 documentary ''[[Forks Over Knives]]'', based on his work in ''Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease'' and the research of his his colleague [[T. Colin Campbell]] in ''[[The China Study]]''. It also explores the work of other doctors who share this approach as well as the personal experiences of some Esselstyn's patients.  Esselstyn's son,  [[Rip Esselstyn]], a "professional triathlete," firefighter, and author of ''The Engine 2 Diet'' based on his father's research, also appears in the film as does his wife Ann.
