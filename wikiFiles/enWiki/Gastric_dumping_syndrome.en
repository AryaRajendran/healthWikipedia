'''Gastric dumping syndrome''', or '''rapid gastric emptying''' is a condition where ingested foods bypass the stomach too rapidly and enter the small intestine largely undigested. It happens when the small intestine expands too quickly due to the presence of hyperosmolar (having increased [[osmolarity]]) food from the [[stomach]]. "Early" dumping begins concurrently with or immediately succeeding ingestion of a meal. Symptoms of early dumping include nausea, [[vomiting]], [[bloating]], cramping, diarrhea, dizziness, and fatigue. "Late" dumping happens one to three hours after eating. Symptoms of late dumping include weakness, sweating, and dizziness. Many people have both types. The syndrome is most often associated with [[Gastric bypass surgery|gastric bypass]] (Roux-en-Y) surgery.

Rapid loading of the small intestine with hypertonic stomach contents can lead to rapid entry of water into the intestinal lumen. Osmotic diarrhea, distension of the small bowel (leading to crampy abdominal pain), and [[hypovolemia]] can result.

In addition, people with this syndrome often suffer from low [[blood sugar]], or [[hypoglycemia]], because the rapid "dumping" of food triggers the [[pancreas]] to release excessive amounts of [[insulin]] into the bloodstream. This type of hypoglycemia is referred to as "alimentary hypoglycemia."

==Diagnosis==
Physicians diagnose dumping syndrome primarily on the basis of symptoms in patients who have had gastric surgery. Tests may be needed to exclude other conditions that have similar symptoms. Two ways of determining if a patient has dumping syndrome include barium [[fluoroscopy]] and radionuclide [[scintigraphy]]. In the first procedure, a contrast of barium-labeled medium is ingested and x-ray images are taken; early dumping can be easily recognized by premature emptying of the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] medium from the stomach.

The second method, scintigraphy (or radionuclide scanning), involves a similar procedure in which a labeled medium containing [[Technetium-99m|<sup>99m</sup>Tc]] (or other radionuclide) [[colloid]] or [[chelate]] is ingested. The <sup>99m</sup>Tc [[isotope]] decays in the stomach, and the gamma photons emitted are detected by a [[gamma camera]]; the radioactivity of the area of interest (the stomach) can then be plotted against time on a graph. Patients with dumping syndrome generally exhibit steep drops in their activity plots, corresponding to abnormally rapid emptying of gastric contents into the [[duodenum]].

==Treatment==
Dumping syndrome is largely avoidable by avoiding certain foods that are likely to cause it; therefore, having a bigger digestive tract [[balanced diet]] is important. Treatment includes changes in eating habits and medication. People who have gastric dumping syndrome need to eat several small meals a day that are low in [[carbohydrate]]s, avoiding simple sugars, and should drink liquids between meals, not with them. Fiber delays gastric emptying and reduces insulin peaks. People with severe cases take medicine (such as [[octreotide]] and [[cholestyramine]]) or [[proton pump inhibitor]]s (such as [[pantoprazole]] and [[omeprazole]]) to slow their digestion. Doctors may also recommend [[surgery]]. Surgical intervention may include conversion of a [[Billroth II]] to a Roux-en Y gastrojejunostomy.
