'''Dopaminergic pathways''' are [[neural]] pathways in the [[brain]] which transmit the neurotransmitter [[dopamine]] from one region of the brain to another.<ref name="urlBeyond the Reward Pathway">{{cite web |url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/reward/pathways.html |title=Beyond the Reward Pathway |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref>

The neurons of the dopaminergic pathways have [[axon]]s which run the entire length of the pathway.  The neurons' soma produce the enzymes that synthesize dopamine, and they are then transmitted via the projecting axons to their synaptic destinations, where most of the dopamine is produced. Dopaminergic nerve cell bodies in such areas as the [[substantia nigra]] tend to be pigmented due to the presence of the black pigment [[melanin]].

==Examples==
There are eight dopaminergic [[neural pathway|pathways]], but the four major ones are:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Name''' || '''Description''' || '''Disorders''' 
 |- 
 | [[mesolimbic pathway]]|| The mesolimbic pathway transmits dopamine from the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) to the [[limbic system]] via the [[nucleus accumbens]].  The VTA is located in the [[midbrain]], and the nucleus accumbens is in the [[ventral striatum]].  The "meso-" [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] in the word "mesolimbic" refers to the midbrain, or "middle brain", since "meso" means "middle" in [[Greek language|Greek]]. || [[schizophrenia]] 
 |- 
 | [[mesocortical pathway]] || The mesocortical pathway transmits dopamine from the VTA to the [[frontal cortex]].  The "meso-" prefix in "mesocortical" refers to the VTA which is located in the midbrain, and "cortical" refers to the cortex.  || [[schizophrenia]] 
 |- 
 | [[nigrostriatal pathway]] || The nigrostriatal pathway transmits dopamine from the [[substantia nigra]] to the [[striatum]].  This pathway is associated with motor control. || [[Parkinson's disease]], [[chorea]]
 |- 
 | [[tuberoinfundibular pathway]] || The tuberoinfundibular pathway transmits dopamine from the [[hypothalamus]] to the [[pituitary gland]].  This pathway influences the secretion of certain [[hormone]]s, including [[prolactin]].  "Infundibular" in the word "tuberoinfundibular" refers to the cup or [[Pituitary stalk|''infundibulum'']] out of which the pituitary gland develops.|| [[hyperprolactinaemia]]
|}

Minor ones include the [[incertohypothalamic pathway]] within the hypothalamus, which has a role in sexual behaviour.
