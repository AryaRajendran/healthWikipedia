A '''standing frame''' (also known as a '''stand''', '''stander''', '''standing technology''', '''standing aid''', '''standing device''', '''standing box''', '''tilt table''') is [[assistive technology]] that can be used by a person who relies on a [[wheelchair]] for mobility.  A standing frame provides alternative positioning to sitting in a wheelchair by supporting the person in the standing position.

== Types and function ==

Common types of standers include:  sit to stand, prone, [[supine position|supine]], upright, multi-positioning standers, and [[Standing wheelchair|standing wheelchairs]].  Long leg braces are also a standing device but not used often today.  

* ''Passive (static) stander'': A passive stander remains in one place.  They sometimes have casters, but cannot be self-propelled.
* ''Mobile (dynamic) stander'': User can self-propel a mobile stander if they have the strength to push a manual wheelchair.  Some standers are also available with powered mobility.
* ''Active stander'': An active stander creates reciprocal movement of the arms legs while standing.

== Diagnoses and users==

Standers are used by people with mild to severe [[disabilities]] such as [[spinal cord injury]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[spina bifida]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[stroke]], [[Rett syndrome]], and [[post-polio syndrome]]. 

'''Spinal cord injury''':  

Standers are used by people with both [[paraplegia]] and [[quadriplegia]] since a variety of support options are available to accommodate for mild to severe disabilities.  [[Doug Betters]] and [[Mike Utley]] are both former [[NFL]] football players who are quadriplegics due to spinal cord injury. They both stand using active standers.

Bone mineral loss and [[osteoporosis]] are common consequences after [[spinal cord injury]]. Therapeutic standing, a weight-bearing intervention that can be applied using a standing frame, has traditionally been incorporated into rehabilitation programs for those with chronic spinal cord injury in order to prevent osteoporosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goktepe|first=A.S.|coauthors=Tugcu, I., Yilmaz, B., Alaca, R., & Gunduz, S.|title=Does standing protect bone density in patients with chronic spinal cord injury?|journal=J Spinal Cord Med|year=2008|volume=31|issue=2|pages=197–201|pmid=18581668}}</ref> A systematic review of the literature conducted by Biering-Sorenson et al. (2009) shows that therapeutic standing in the chronic phase of injury, defined as one year after injury, has no effect on maintaining [[bone density]]. Results on the effectiveness of therapeutic standing during the first year of injury are conflicting and show that shorter, less aggressive intervention is less effective. If therapeutic standing is to be incorporated into treatment, it should be more aggressive and initiated in the early stages of injury if any beneficial impacts on bone mineral density are hoped to be achieved.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Biering-Sorenson|first=F.|coauthors=Hansen, B., & Lee, B.S.|title=Non-pharmacological treatment and prevention of bone loss after spinal cord injury: a systematic review|journal=Spinal Cord|year=2009|volume=47|issue=7|pages=508–518|pmid=19172152}}</ref>

== Common settings and applications ==

Standing devices are used in a variety of settings including:
* In the home and workplace,
* Early intervention centers,
* Schools ([[special education]] classes or the [[inclusive classroom]]), [[adapted physical education]] classes,
* Children's hospitals and therapy centers,
* Rehabilitation facilities and hospitals,
* Extended care units, [[nursing homes]], assisted living centers and group homes, and veterans' hospitals.

==Obtaining a standing frame==

Funding (government funding or health insurance) for standing equipment is achievable in most developed countries, but usually requires medical justification and a letter of [[medical necessity]] (a detailed [[medical prescription]]) written by a physical therapist or medical professional.
