==Development==
On January 30, 1999, scientists announced that a lab-grown bladder had been successfully transplanted into dogs. These artificial bladders worked well for almost a year in the dogs. In 2000, a new procedure for creating artificial bladders for humans was developed. This procedure is called an orthotopic neobladder procedure. This procedure involves shaping a part (usually 35 to 40&nbsp;inches) of a patient's [[small intestine]] to form a new bladder, however, as explained above, these bladders made of intestinal tissues produced unpleasant side-effects.

In 2006, the first publication of experimental transplantation of bioengineered bladders appeared in ''The Lancet''.<ref name=atala2006>{{Citation

==Procedure==
First a [[CT scan]] of the patient is taken to determine the shape of the bladder that must be created.<ref name=bbc2006/>  Next a tissue sample is taken from the patient's bladder.<ref name=bbc2006/>  These cells (primarily [[urothelial]] and muscle cells)<ref name=atala2006/> are grown over a period of 7 to 8 weeks then layered onto a [[biodegradable]] "[[scaffold]]" in the shape that the required bladder is to take.<ref name=bbc2006/>  The entire bladder along with the biodegradable scaffold is then transplanted.<ref name=bbc2006/>  Over time, the biodegradable scaffold will degrade within the patient's body.<ref name=bbc2006>{{Citation

==Benefits==
Bioengineered organs which rely on a patient's own cells, [[autologous]] constructs, are not subject to [[transplant rejection]], unlike transplants from human or animal donors.

The current standard for repairing a damaged [[urinary bladder]] involves partial or complete replacement using tissue from the small intestine.<ref name=clevclin2009/>  Patients with bladders made of intestinal tissues suffer unpleasant side-effects because intestinal tissues reabsorb chemicals that are meant to be eliminated through the urine.<ref name=smith2006/><ref name=bijal2007>{{Citation
