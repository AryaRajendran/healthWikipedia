A '''dressing''' is an adjunct used by a person for application to a [[wound]] to promote [[wound healing|healing]] and/or prevent further harm.   A dressing is designed to be in direct contact with the wound, which makes it different from a [[bandage]], which is primarily used to hold a dressing in place.  Some organisations classify them as the same thing (for example, the British Pharmacopoeia) and the terms are used interchangeably by some people.  Dressings are frequently used in [[first aid]] and [[nursing]].

==Core purposes of a dressing==
A dressing can have a number of purposes, depending on the type, severity and position of the wound, although all purposes are focused towards promoting recovery and preventing further harm from the wound.  Key purposes of a dressing are:
* '''Stem [[bleeding]]''' – to help to seal the wound to expedite the [[clot]]ting process; 
* '''Absorb [[exudate]]''' – to soak up blood, plasma, and other fluids exuded from the wound, containing it/them in one place;
* '''Ease [[pain]]''' – to have an actual pain-relieving effect, whereas some others may have a [[placebo]] effect; 
* '''[[Debridement|Debride]] the wound''' - to remove slough and foreign objects from the wound; 
* '''Protection from [[infection]]''' - to defend the wound against germs and mechanical damage;  
* '''Promote [[healing]]''' – to contribute to recovery via [[granulation tissue|granulation]] and [[epithelialization]]; and 
* '''Reduce [[psychological stress]]''' – to obscure a healing wound from the view of others.

==Types of dressing==
Historically, a '''dressing''' was usually a piece of material, sometimes [[cloth]], but the use of cobwebs, dung, leaves and honey have also been described.  However, modern dressings<ref>{{cite web |title=www.dressings.org | url=http://www.dressings.org/ | format=|publisher = SMTL |accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> include [[gauze]] (which may be impregnated with an agent designed to help sterility or to speed healing), films, gels, foams, [[Hydrocolloid dressing|hydrocolloids, alginates, hydrogels]] and polysaccharide pastes, granules and beads. Many gauze dressings have a layer of nonstick film over the absorbent gauze to prevent the wound from adhering to the dressing. Dressings can be impregnated with antiseptic chemicals, as in [[boracic lint]] or where medicinal [[Castor oil]] was used in the first surgical dressings<ref>{{cite web | title=Report upon the Use of a Mixture of Castor oil and Balsam of Peru as a Surgical Dressing | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&pageindex=1&artid=1425429 | format=| publisher=pubmedcentral | accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref>

In the 1960s, [[George D. Winter | George Winter]] published his controversial research on moist healing. Previously, the accepted wisdom was that to prevent infection of a wound, the wound should be kept as dry as possible. Winter demonstrated that wounds kept moist healed faster than those exposed to the air or covered with traditional dressings. 

Various types of dressings can be used to accomplish different objectives including:
* Controlling the moisture content, so that the wound stays moist or dry. {{anchor|Aquacel}} An example of a moisture-retaining dressing is ''Aquacel'', which is a "hydrofiber" that is indicated, for example, for partial-thickness [[burn]]s.<ref>{{cite pmid|14726745}} [http://journals.lww.com/burncareresearch/Abstract/2004/01000/Aquacel_Ag_R__in_the_Management_of.15.aspx]</ref>
* Protecting the wound from [[infection]],
* Removing slough, and
* Maintaining the optimum [[pH]] and temperature to encourage healing.

Occlusive dressings, made from substances impervious to moisture such as [[plastic]] or [[latex]], can be used to increase the rate of absorption of certain [[topical medications]] into the skin.

==Usage of dressings==
Applying a dressing is a [[first aid]] skill, although many people undertake the practice with no training – especially on minor wounds.  Modern dressings will almost all come in a prepackaged [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] wrapping, date coded to ensure sterility. This is because it will come in to direct contact with the wound, and sterility is required to fulfill the 'protection from infection' aim of a dressing.  

Historically, and still the case in many less developed areas and in an emergency, dressings are often improvised as needed.  This can consist of anything, including clothing or spare material, which will fulfill some of the basic tenets of a dressing – usually stemming bleeding and absorbing exudate.

Applying and changing dressings is one common task in [[nursing]].  

An "ideal" wound dressing is one that is sterile, breathable, and conducive for a moist healing environment.  This will then reduce the risk of infection, help the wound heal more quickly, and reduce scarring.
