'''Eugen D. Relgis''' (backward reading of '''Eisig D. Sigler'''; first name also '''Eugenio''', '''Eugène''' or '''Eugene''', last name also '''Siegler''' or '''Siegler Watchel''';<ref name="epheman">{{fr icon}} [http://epheman.perso.neuf.fr/mars22.html#relgis ''22 mars. Eugen Relgis''], [http://epheman.perso.neuf.fr/ Ephéméride Anarchiste] entry; retrieved March 10, 2011</ref> March 22, 1895 – May 24, 1987) was a [[Romania]]n writer, [[Pacifism|pacifist]] philosopher and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] militant, known as a theorist of [[humanitarianism]]. His [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] dogma, with distinct echoes from [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish ethics]], was first shaped during [[World War I]], when Relgis was a [[conscientious objector]]. Infused with [[anarcho-pacifism]] and [[socialism]], it provided Relgis with an international profile, and earned him the support of pacifists such as [[Romain Rolland]], [[Stefan Zweig]] and [[Albert Einstein]]. Another, more controversial, aspect of Relgis' philosophy was his support for [[eugenics]], which centered on the [[compulsory sterilization]] of "[[Degeneration|degenerates]]". The latter proposal was voiced by several of Relgis' essays and [[Sociology|sociological]] tracts.

After an early debut with [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's Symbolist movement]], Relgis promoted [[modernist literature]] and the poetry of [[Tudor Arghezi]], signing his name to a succession of literary and political magazines. His work in fiction and poetry alternates the extremes of [[Expressionism]] and [[Didacticism|didactic art]], giving artistic representation to his activism, his pacifist vision, or his struggle with a [[hearing impairment]]. He was a member of several modernist circles, formed around Romanian magazines such as ''[[Sburătorul]]'', ''[[Contimporanul]]'' or ''[[Şantier]]'', but also close to the more mainstream journal ''[[Viaţa Românească]]''. His political and literary choices made Relgis an enemy of both [[fascism]] and [[communism]]: persecuted during [[World War II]], he eventually took refuge in [[Uruguay]]. From 1947 to the moment of his death, Relgis earned the respect of [[South America]]n circles as an anarchist commentator and proponent of solutions to [[world peace]], as well as a promoter of [[Latin American culture]].

===Early life and literary debut===
The future Eugen Relgis was a native of [[Moldavia]] region, belonging to the [[History of the Jews in Romania|local Jewish community]]. His father, David Sigler, professed Judaism,<ref name="bmiudaistul">{{ro icon}} Boris Marian, [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr227/pagina13.pdf "Iudaistul Eugen Relgis"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 227 (1027), March–April 2005, p.13</ref> and descended from [[Tanning|tanners]] settled in [[Neamţ County]].<ref name="ddgsIII-IV">Dorian & Şerban, p.III-IV</ref> Eisig had two sisters, Adelina Derevici and Eugenia Soru, both of whom had careers in [[biochemistry]].<ref name="ddgsIV">Dorian & Şerban, p.IV</ref> Born in either [[Iaşi]] city<ref name="epheman"/><ref name="bmiudaistul"/><ref name="filosofiaer">{{es icon}} ''[http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a046.htm Eugenio Relgis. 1895-1987]'', [http://www.filosofia.org/ Proyecto filosofía en español] entry; retrieved March 10, 2011</ref><ref name="militantsrelg">{{fr icon}} [http://militants-anarchistes.info/spip.php?article5046&lang=fr "Relgis, Eugen"], ''[http://militants-anarchistes.info/?lang=fr Dictionaire international des militants anarchistes]'' entry; retrieved March 10, 2011</ref><ref name="eriisg">[http://www.iisg.nl/archives/nl/files/r/10767491.php#scopecontent "Note on the Eugen Relgis Papers"], at the [[International Institute of Social History]]; retrieved March 9, 2011</ref><ref name="acpensador">{{es icon}} Agustín Courtoisie, [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/74/courtoisie74.html "Notas de Análisis.

L. Zissu]]. It was in Zissu's circle that Relgis probably first met his mentor, the Romanian modernist author Tudor Arghezi; at the time, Arghezi was married to Constanţa Zissu, mother of his photographer son [[Eli Lotar]].<ref name="pc56">Cernat, p.56</ref> The young writer later noted that he and Zissu were both touched by the wild landscape of the [[Ceahlău Massif]] and Piatra's ''[[shtetl]]'' atmosphere.<ref name="ddgsIII-IV"/> In another one of his texts, Relgis recalled having been influenced in childhood by selective readings from the Romanian Jewish scholar [[Moses Schwarzfeld]] and his ''Anuarul pentru Israeliţi'' journal (he told that, during later years, he had collected the entire ''Anuarul'' collection).<ref name="ddgsV">Dorian & Şerban, p.V</ref>

Taking his first steps in literary life, Eisig Sigler adopted his new name through forms of wordplay which enjoyed some popularity among pseudonymous Jewish writers (the case of [[Paul Celan]], born ''Ancel'').<ref>{{ro icon}} Arnold Helman, [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/realitatea_evreiasca_03_01.html ''Contribuţia scriitorilor evrei la literatura română. Ilarie Voronca şi Paul Celan - două destine tragice''], at the [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html Romanian Jewish Community site]; retrieved March 10, 2011</ref> He was from early on a promoter of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and modernist literature, a cause into which he blended his [[left-wing]] perspective and calls for [[Jewish emancipation]]. Writing in 2007, literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] suggested that Relgis, like fellow humanitarianist and Jewish intellectual [[Isac Ludo]], had a "not at all negligible" part to play in the early diffusion of Romanian modernism.<ref>Cernat, p.34</ref> Relgis' main contribution in the 1910s was the Symbolist tribune ''Fronda'' ("The Fronde"), the three consecutive issues of which he edited, in Iaşi, between April and June 1912.<ref>Cernat, p.55-57</ref>

Like Ludo's review ''Absolutio'' (which saw print two years later), ''Fronda'' stood for the radical branch of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist movement]] in Iaşi, in contrast to both the left-leaning but traditionalist magazine ''[[Viaţa Românească]]'' and the more conventional Symbolism of ''[[Versuri şi Proză]]'' journal.<ref>Cernat, p.55-56</ref> Its editorial board, Relgis included, went anonymous, but their names were known to other periodicals of the day and to later researchers. According to Cernat, Relgis was "the most significant ''Frondiste''", seconded by two future figures in Romanian Jewish journalism: Albert Schreiber and Carol Steinberg.<ref name="pc56"/> Like Ludo and poet [[Benjamin Fondane]], the ''Fronda'' group represented those Romanian Jewish aficionados in Iaşi who followed the Symbolist-modernist school of Arghezi, and who promoted Arghezi's poetry in northern Romania: ''Fronda''{{'}}s writers were noted for saluting ''Viaţa Românească'' when it too began hosting poems by Arghezi.<ref>Cernat, p.56, 57</ref> 

''Fronda'' put out three issues in all, after which time Relgis became an occasional contributor to more circulated periodicals, among them ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'' (founded by Arghezi and the socialist agitator [[N. D. Cocea]]) and ''[[Vieaţa Nouă]]'' (led by Symbolist critic [[Ovid Densusianu]]).<ref name="pc56"/> In 1913, he collected his loose philosophical essays, or "fantasies", in the volume ''Triumful nefiinţei'' ("The Triumph of Non-Being").<ref name="bmiudaistul"/><ref name="rjpietreni">{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_08.html ''Carte de neuitare a evreilor pietreni''], at the [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html Romanian Jewish Community site]; retrieved March 10, 2011</ref><ref>Lovinescu, p.100; Rose, p.12</ref> He published his first two books of poems during [[World War I]], but before the end of [[Romania during World War I|Romania's neutrality period]]. The first one was a collection of [[sonnet]]s, ''Sonetele nebuniei'' ("Sonnets of Madness"), printed at Iaşi in 1914; the second was published in the capital, [[Bucharest]], as ''Nebunia'' ("Madness").<ref name="gc1029">Călinescu, p.1029</ref> Some of these poems were illustrated with drawings in Relgis' own hand.<ref name="bmiudaistul"/><ref name="rjpietreni"/>

===From ''Umanitatea'' to ''Mântuirea''===
After training in architecture, Relgis was enrolled at the [[University of Bucharest]], where he took courses in Philosophy.<ref name="epheman"/><ref name="bmiudaistul"/> During the period, he first left Romania on a trip to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Greece]].<ref name="militantsrelg"/> He interrupted his studies shortly after [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|Romania entered the war]], in the second half of 1916.<ref name="epheman"/> Back in Iaşi after the [[Central Powers]] stormed into southern Romania, he was reportedly drafted into the [[Romanian Land Forces]], but refused to take up arms as a [[conscientious objector]]; briefly imprisoned as a result, he was in the end discharged for his deafness.<ref name="militantsrelg"/>

Resuming his publishing activity upon the end of war, Eugen Relgis began publicizing his humanitarianist and pacifist agenda. In summer 1918, Relgis became one of the contributors to the Iaşi-based review ''Umanitatea'' ("The Humanity" or "The Human Race"). Historian [[Lucian Boia]], who notes that ''Umanitatea'' was published when Romania's [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|temporary defeat]] seemed to announce sweeping political reforms, believes that the magazine mainly reflected the "nebulous" agenda of a senior editor, the [[Bessarabia]]n journalist [[Alexis Nour]].<ref>Boia, p.259-260</ref> In addition to Relgis and Nour, ''Umanitatea'' enlisted contributions from Ludo and [[Avram Steuerman-Rodion]].<ref name="lb260">Boia, p.260</ref> The short-lived magazine, Boia writes, supported [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], [[labor rights]] and, unusually in the context of "pronounced Romanian [[antisemitism]]", Jewish emancipation.<ref name="lb260"/> On his own, Relgis published a magazine of the same title, issued during 1920.<ref name="epheman"/><ref name="rjpietreni"/><ref name="ddgsII">Dorian & Şerban, p.II</ref> According to one account, ''Umanitatea'' was closed down by Romania's military censorship, which kept a check on radical publications.<ref name="epheman"/><ref name="militantsrelg"/> In 1921, an unsigned chronicle in the [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]]-based ''[[Gândirea]]'' journal recognized in Relgis "the kind and enthusiastic young man who was propagating [...] the religion of man through ''Umanitatea'' magazine".<ref name="c&rgandirea">{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1921-1922/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1921_1922_001_003.pdf "Cărţi şi reviste.

Relgis resumed his literary activity early in the [[interwar period]]. He authored his ideological essay ''Literatura războiului şi era nouă'' (Bucharest, 1919); another such piece, ''Umanitarism sau Internaţionala intelectualilor'' ("Humanitarianism or the Intellectuals' Internationale"), taken up by ''Viaţa Românească'' in 1922.<ref name="rjpietreni"/><ref name="gc1029"/><ref name="dllafjvl">Dora Litani-Littman, Abraham Feller, [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16634.html "Relgis (Sigler), Eugen"], ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' entry (republished by the [[Jewish Virtual Library]]); retrieved March 10, 2011</ref> ''Viaţa Românească'' also published Relgis' abridged translation of ''The Biology of War'', a pacifist treatise by [[Germany|German]] physician [[Georg Friedrich Nicolai]].<ref name="c&rgandirea"/> 1922 witnessed the birth of Relgis' manifesto ''Principiile umanitariste'' ("Humanitarianist Principles"), which offered Relgis' own conclusions on [[world peace]], while reaffirming the need to create an international pacifist forum of intellectuals.<ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="gslvprolog"/><ref name="rjpietreni"/><ref name="dllafjvl"/> It carried a preface by Nicolai.<ref name="filosofiaer"/> 

Relgis also set up the First Humanitarianist Group of Romania,<ref name="epheman"/><ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="militantsrelg"/><ref name="rjpietreni"/> as well as a leftist library, ''Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea'' ("Freedom Circle Library").<ref name="epheman"/><ref name="ddgsII"/> Joined in such efforts by the veteran anarchists [[Han Ryner]] and [[Panait Muşoiu]],<ref name="epheman"/> Relgis also circulated an ''Apel către toţi intelectualii liberi şi muncitorii luminaţi'' ("Appeal to All the Free Intellectuals and the Enlightened Workers").<ref name="rjpietreni"/> Before 1932, the Humanitarianist Group created some 23 regional branches in [[Greater Romania]].<ref name="militantsrelg"/> Beginning 1925, Relgis also represented Romanian pacifists within the [[War Resisters' International]].<ref name="epheman"/><ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="militantsrelg"/><ref name="eriisg"/>

In the meantime, he continued to publish sporadic poems, such as ''Ascetism'' ("Asceticism"), featured in ''Gândirea''.<ref name="c&rgandirea">{{ro icon}} Eugen Relgis, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1921-1922/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1921_1922_001_010.pdf "Ascetism"], in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 10/1921, p.189 (digitized by the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])</ref> The year 1923 witnessed the beginnings of a friendship between Relgis and the aspiring pacifist author [[George Mihail Zamfirescu]]. Relgis prefaced Zamfirescu's book ''Flamura albă'' ("The White Flag"), and contributed to Zamfirescu's magazine ''Icoane Maramureşene'' ("[[Maramureş]] Icons").<ref name="mpzamfirescu">{{ro icon}} Mircea Popa, [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=2006 "George Mihail Zamfirescu"], in the [[1 Decembrie 1918 University, Alba Iulia|December 1 University of Alba Iulia]] [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=philologica ''Philologica Yearbook''], 2006, I, p.30</ref> A prose volume, ''Peregrinări'' ("Wanderings"), saw print with [[Editura Socec]] the same year.<ref name="gc1029"/> Relgis also published, in 1924, the 3 volumes of his main novel ''Petru Arbore'' (a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' named after its main protagonist).<ref>Călinescu, p.1029; Lovinescu, p.237-238; Rose, p.12</ref> Two new volumes of his topical essays saw print in later years: the first one, published by the printing offices of fellow journalist [[Barbu Brănişteanu]], was ''Umanitarism şi socialism'' ("Humanitarianism and Socialism", 1925); the second, printed in 1926, was titled ''Umanitarismul biblic'' ("Humanitarianism in the [[Bible]]").<ref name="bmiudaistul"/><ref name="dllafjvl"/> His press activity included contributions to Zionist papers: a writer for ''[[Ştiri din Lumea Evreiască]]'', he was also briefly on the staff of Zissu's ''[[Mântuirea]]''.<ref name="dllafjvl"/>

===''Sburătorul'' and ''Umanitarismul''===
Also during the early 1920s, Eugen Relgis came into contact with the Bucharest-based ''[[Sburătorul]]'' circle, which stood for modernist literature and [[aesthetic relativism]]. The eponymous magazine published samples of his [[lyrical poetry]].<ref name="ddgsII"/> With his humanitarian literature, Relgis was a singular figure among the many ''Sburătorul'' factions, as later noted by literary historian [[Ovid Crohmălniceanu]] in discussing the studied eclecticism of ''Sburătorul'' doyen [[Eugen Lovinescu]].<ref>Crohmălniceanu, p.24</ref> Another Romanian researcher, [[Henri Zalis]], notes that Relgis was one of the many Jewish intellectuals whom Lovinescu cultivated in reaction to the tradition of [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalist]] discrimination.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Henri Zalis]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/ZALISaug4.html "Apropieri de o moştenire diferenţiată"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', August 2004</ref> However, according to critic [[Eugen Simion]], Lovinescu also greatly exaggerated Relgis' literary worth.<ref>Simion, in Lovinescu, p.328</ref>

Relgis' contribution to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] was renewed in 1926, when he published ''Melodiile tăcerii'' ("Melodies of Silence") and the collection ''Poezii'' ("Poems"), followed in 1927 by ''Glasuri în surdină'' ("Muted Voices").<ref name="gc1029"/> The latter novel, later republished with a foreword by [[Austria]]n author [[Stefan Zweig]],<ref name="militantsrelg"/><ref name="wr12">Rose, p.12</ref><ref name="mancsiusa">{{it icon}} ''[http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?TipoPag=prodpersona&Chiave=151&RicFrmRicSemplice=relgis&RicProgetto=personalita&RicSez=produttori&RicVM=ricercasemplice&RicLin=en Archivi di personalità.

At that stage in his career, Eugen Relgis was also a contributor to the Bucharest left-wing dailies ''[[Adevărul]]'' and ''[[Dimineaţa]]'', part of a new generation of radical or pacifist authors cultivated by the newspaper (alongside Zamfirescu, [[Ion Marin Sadoveanu]] and various others).<ref name="mpzamfirescu"/> His pieces for ''Adevărul'' include insights into [[medical sociology]], such as the September 1922 ''Înapoi, la biologie!''

After editing the short-lived gazette ''Cugetul Liber'' ("[[Freethought]]"),<ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="eriisg"/><ref name="dllafjvl"/> Eugen Relgis put out the political and cultural review ''Umanitarismul'' ("Humanitarianism").

===Travels abroad and ''Şantier'' affiliation===
The Romanian writer traveled extensively to promote his ideas of social change. By 1928, he was in regular correspondence with [[France|French]] writer and [[human rights]] activist [[Romain Rolland]], who answered in writing to Relgis' various inquiries.<ref>Duchatelet, p.41</ref> He was a delegate to pacifist reunions in [[Hoddesdon]], [[England]] and [[Sonntagberg]], Austria (1928).<ref name="epheman"/><ref name="filosofiaer"/> Relgis also exchanged letters with various other prestigious left-wing intellectuals: Zweig, [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Henri Barbusse]], [[Max Nettlau]] etc.<ref name="militantsrelg"/><ref name="ddgsII"/> His various inquiries also enlisted positive replies from other international supporters of pacifism: physicist [[Albert Einstein]], biologist [[Auguste Forel]], writer [[Heinrich Mann]] and anarchist militant [[Paul Reclus]].<ref name="ddgsII"/> He became a contributor to [[Sebastien Faure]]'s ''[[Anarchist Encyclopedia]]'', with the "Humanitarianism" entry.<ref name="militantsrelg"/> In 1929, Delpeuch company published his [[French-language]] essay ''L'Internationale pacifiste'' ("The Pacifist International"),<ref>Duchatelet, p.33, 41</ref> reissued the same year in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], [[Spain]], as ''La Internacional Pacifista''.<ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="acpensador"/>

In 1932, he published the [[German-language]] collection of interviews ''Wege zum Friede'' ("Path toward Peace").<ref name="eriisg"/> His other travels into [[Bulgaria]], where he represented Romanian [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]] at an international congress, were discussed in his 1933 volume ''Bulgaria necunoscută'' ("Unknown Bulgaria").<ref name="militantsrelg"/><ref>Clopoţel (1933), ''passim''</ref> The volume ''Cosmometápolis'', about the creation of a [[world government]],<ref name="jpb638">Joseph Preston Baratta, ''The Politics of World Federation: From World Federation to Global Governance'', [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], Vol. 2, Westport, 2004, p.638.

Relgis' participation in left-wing causes was attacked at home by the antisemitic and proto-[[Fascism|fascist]] [[National Christian Defense League]], whose press organ ''Înfrăţirea Românească'' alleged that "squire Siegler" and his ''Umanitarismul'', together with the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], were fostering communist agitation.<ref>{{ro icon}} Ion V.

In his subsequent activity as a journalist and publisher, Relgis combined his humanitarianism with topical interests. He was by then an advocate of [[eugenics]], an interest reflected in his 1934 (or 1935) tract ''Umanitarism şi eugenism'' ("Humanitarianism and Eugenism"), published by Editura Vegetarianismul company.<ref>Bucur, p.187, 282; Turda, p.93</ref> In 1936, he also released the collection ''Esseuri despre iudaism'' ("Essays on [[Judaism]]") with Cultura Poporului.<ref name="bmiudaistul"/><ref name="gslvprolog"/><ref name="dllafjvl"/><ref name="ddgsII, V">Dorian & Şerban, p.II, V</ref> He was at the time active within the Jewish Cultural Institute, an annex of the [[Templul Coral|Bucharest Choral Temple]].<ref name="dllafjvl"/> His international activity peaked during the [[Spanish Civil War]], when he helped organize anarchist support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican regime]], elected Councilor of the [[International Antifascist Solidarity]].<ref name="militantsrelg"/>

===World War II, persecution and departure===
Eugen Relgis was still active on the literary scene during the first two years of [[World War II]], before Romania formalized its military alliance with the [[Axis Powers]]. The [[Phoney War]] caught him in France, but he returned to Romania shortly after, exposing himself to persecution by the growing Romanian fascist movements.<ref name="militantsrelg"/> In February 1940, he gave a retrospective lecture, republished by the newspaper ''[[L'Indépendence Roumaine]]'', on the work of Austrian [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>''[http://www.freud.org.uk/archive/catalogue/press-cuttings/title2/DESC/2/ Archive Catalogues. Press Cuttings]'', [[Freud Museum]] archive; retrieved March 7, 2011</ref> Another book of his political prose, ''Spiritul activ'' ("The Active Spirit"), saw print the same year.<ref name="gc1029"/>

The emergence of antisemitic and fascist regimes (''see [[Romania in World War II]], [[Holocaust in Romania]]'') signified the beginning of Relgis' marginalization. During the short-lived [[National Legionary State]], established by the [[Iron Guard]] fascists between 1940 and early 1941, the author lived in seclusion.<ref name="militantsrelg"/> His ''Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea'' was banned in 1940, but Relgis secretly moved the books into a stable.<ref name="ddgsII"/> After the Guard fell from power, the [[Ion Antonescu]] dictatorship still included Relgis on a nationally-circulated list of banned Romanian Jewish authors,<ref>Rotman, p.174-175</ref> but Relgis continued to write. His texts of the time include a posthumous praise of his pacifist disciple Iosif Gutman, the son of a Bucharest [[rabbi]], who had been killed during the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Bucharest pogrom]].<ref name="gslvprolog"/><ref name="ddgsII"/> The essay was planned as part of Rabbi Gutman's volume ''Slove de martiri'' ("Notes by Martyrs"), which, although anti-Guard, was not given Antonescu's imprimatur.<ref name="ddgsII"/> Relgis was however able to publish an article in the Jewish-only magazine ''Renaşterea Noastră'', on the occasion of Iosif's ''[[Bereavement in Judaism|yahrtzeit]]'', where he compared the Gutmans to [[Laocoön and His Sons]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr310_311/pagina04.pdf "21-23 ianuarie 1941.

A final period in Relgis' Romanian activity came after the [[King Michael's Coup|August 1944 Coup]] toppled Antonescu and denounced Romania's Axis alliance. In 1945, he was dedicated a public celebration at the Jewish Cultural Institute, which included a speech by [[Chief Rabbi]] [[Alexandru Şafran]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_19.html ''Institutul Cultural al Templului Coral.

With [[refugee]] status,<ref name="wr12"/> having reportedly been singled out for arrest by the [[Romanian Communist Party]] officials,<ref name="militantsrelg"/> Relgis departed from Romania in 1947, shortly before the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] took hold.

During his last decades, Eugen Relgis dedicated himself to sociological research and political activism. He embarked on a series of university lectures, which carried him throughout Uruguay, Argentina and [[Brazil]].<ref name="epheman"/><ref name="dllafjvl"/> In 1950, he founded an international anarchist archive in Montevideo, reportedly one of the few political libraries in [[South America]] at the time of its creation.<ref>{{es icon}} Roberto Ceamanos Llorens, [http://www.um.edu.uy/_upload/_descarga/web_descarga_218_CEAMANOS_Los_estudios_en_el_extranjero_como_experiencia_formativa_la_experiencia_de_Carlos_Rama.pdf "Los estudios en el extranjero como período formativo.

===South American career===
With noted help from anarchist translator Vladimiro Muñoz,<ref name="epheman"/> Relgis began his new career as a [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] writer and publicist with a succession of works.

In 1954, Relgis printed another biographical study, on Romain Rolland: ''El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria'' ("A Free Man Confronts [[Totalitarianism|Totalitarian]] Barbarity").<ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="acpensador"/><ref>Duchatelet, p.23, 41</ref> The following year, he gave a public lecture at the [[University of the Republic, Uruguay|University of the Republic]], titled "A Writer's Confession", and reissued ''Esseuri despre iudaism'' as ''Profetas y poetas.

In 1958, the University of the Republic published Eugen Relgis' acclaimed political essay ''Perspectivas culturales en Sudamérica'' ("Cultural Perspectives in South America"), for which he received a prize from the [[List of Ministers of Education and Culture (Uruguay)|Uruguayan Ministry of Public Instruction and Social Prevision]].<ref name="wr12"/> Relgis' reputation was consolidated in the intellectual circles and, in 1955, his name was unsuccessfully advanced for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref name="epheman"/><ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="acpensador"/><ref name="rjpietreni"/><ref>{{ro icon}} Sanda-Valeria Moraru, [http://studia.ubbcluj.ro/download/pdf/566.pdf "Recenzii.

Relgis returned to poetry in 1960 and 1961, with the volumes ''En un lugar de los Andes'' ("Some Place in the [[Andes]]") and ''Locura'' ("Madness"), both translated by Pablo R. Troise.<ref name="filosofiaer"/> They were followed by two other booklets, also in Troise's translation: ''Corazones y motores'' ("Hearts and Engines", 1963), ''Últimos poemas'' ("The Last Poems", 1967).<ref name="filosofiaer"/> His complete ''Obras'' ("Works") were published over the next decades,<ref name="ddgsIV"/> while the essay ''¿Qué es el humanitarismo?

===Final years and death===
In 1962, Eugen Relgis visited [[Israel]] and [[Jerusalem]], tightening his links with the Romanian Israeli community, including the Menora Association and Rabbi David Şafran.<ref>Dorian & Şerban, p.II, VIII</ref> It was in Israel that Relgis published another volume of memoirs, in his native [[Romanian language]]: ''Mărturii de ieri şi de azi'' ("Testimonies of Yesterday and Today").<ref name="dllafjvl"/> In 1972, he was made an honorary staff member of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].<ref name="rjpietreni"/>

From the early 1960s, Relgis was in correspondence with figures in the [[Italy|Italian]] radical circles, such as the anarchist [[Gaspare Mancuso]].<ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="eriisg"/><ref name="mancsiusa"/> In 1964, Mancuso and Regis' other Italian disciples founded the political journal ''Quaderini degli amici di Eugen Relgis'' ("The Friends of Eugen Relgis Notebooks").<ref name="eriisg"/><ref name="mancsiusa"/> He also became an occasional contributor to ''[[Mujeres Libres]]'', the Spanish [[Anarcha-feminism|anarcha-feminist]] tribune in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>Luis Monferrer Catalán, ''Odisea en Albión: los republicanos españoles exiliados en Gran Bretaña 1936-1977'', Ediciones de la Torre, Madrid, 2007, p. 459. ISBN 978-84-7960-386-1</ref> During the 1960s and '70s, as a spell of [[liberalization]] occurred in [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s Romania, Relgis was again in contact with Romanian intellectuals. Before the [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|massive earthquake of 1977]] devastated Bucharest, he was in regular correspondence with scholar Mircea Handoca.<ref name="gslvprolog"/> 

Eugen Relgis lived the final decade of his life as a pensioner of the Uruguayan state—in 1985, a law raised his ''pensión graciable'' to 20,000 [[Uruguayan peso|new pesos]] a month.<ref name="filosofiaer"/> In the 1980s, Relgis was exchanging letters with Romanian cultural historian [[Leon Volovici]], and entertained thoughts about a recovery of his work by Romanian critics and historians.<ref name="gslvprolog"/> He died before this could happen, in Montevideo, at age 92.

==Political doctrine==
===Main ideas===
Throughout his career, Relgis was the proponent of [[anarchism]]. The Romanian writer spoke about the negativity of "state [[fetishism]]", seeking to overturn it and create "universal fraternity",<ref name="gc937">Călinescu, p.937</ref> and, in ''Diario de otoño'', postulated a necessary distinction between Law ("which may be interpreted for or against") and Justice ("elementary" and unavoidable).<ref name="acpensador"/> Relgis likewise believed that war could be overcome once humanity shall have toppled "the three idols: State, Property, Money."<ref name="acpensador"/> Political philosopher [[Ángel Cappelletti]] argues: "Relgis was not an anarchist militant, but was always close to [[Left-libertarianism|libertarian]] ideas".<ref name="aclxxvii"/>

According to [[Stefan Zweig]], Relgis fought "tirelessly for the great goal of spiritual fraternity."<ref name="wr12"/> The sentiment was echoed by [[Romain Rolland]], who recognized in Relgis his disciple: "There is no other European man in whose hands I could place, with as much confidence, [...] my pacifist and [[Universalism|universalist]] idea, for it to be passed on into the future. For none other has such far-reaching intelligence to this goal, and none other would feel this idea so intimately connected to his being."<ref name="ddgsI">Dorian & Şerban, p.I</ref> Speaking from the cultural mainstream, Romanian literary historian [[George Călinescu]] observed Relgis' [[anti-establishment]] and [[anti-art]]istic rhetoric, but described it as mere "[[Idealism|idealist]] reverie", "without any daring proposals that would threaten our [[self-preservation]] instincts".<ref name="gc937"/> Contrarily, scholar William Rose sees Relgis as "an idealist deeply preoccupied by social problems", "a practical and not a [[utopian]] thinker", and a theorist aware that social or economic evolution was needed before his goals could be achieved.<ref name="wr12"/>

Relgis' [[humanitarianism]] (also known as [[humanism]] or pan-humanism; {{lang-es|humanitarismo}})<ref>Rose, p.12. See also Dorian & Şerban, p.VII</ref> was a practical extension of [[anarcho-pacifism]]. William Rose describes this doctrine as both "universalist and pacifist", noting that one of its leading purposes was to eliminate those things "which separate man from man and cause wars".<ref name="wr12"/> Relgis himself spoke of his movement as a form of "active thought", and "a critical method applied to natural, human and social realities",<ref name="gslvprolog"/> while expressing admiration for the [[nonviolent resistance]] tactics advocated in [[British Raj|British India]] by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] or [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="ddgsVII"/> At the time, he attacked all forms of [[pan-nationalism]], from [[Pan-Germanism]] to [[Pan-European nationalism]], defining pan-humanism as "the only 'pan' that can be accepted as a natural law of the human species".<ref name="ddgsVII"/> In ''El humanitarismo'', he called all [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] movements, except his own, corrupted by "the practice of violence and intolerance".<ref name="acpensador"/>

Writing in 1933, the leftist literary columnist [[Ion Clopoţel]] stressed that Relgis' vision combined humanitarianism with "a lively, dynamic and innovating [[socialism]]".<ref name="ic(33)169">Clopoţel (1933), p.169</ref> Although left-wing, Relgis' vision also incorporated militant [[anti-communism]]. As noted by literary historian [[Geo Şerban]], he was from early on skeptical about the outcome of "[[social revolution]]s" and [[Bolshevik]] insurgency.<ref name="ddgsII"/> In the first issue of ''Umanitarianismul'', Relgis criticized both the [[far right]] and the [[far left]], noting that his ideology was "apolitical, in fact antipolitical".<ref name="ddgsII"/> In ''Europa cea tânără'', he referred to the [[Soviet Union]] as the home of "[[proletarian]] [[imperialism]]".<ref name="ddgsVII"/> These thoughts were detailed by ''Diario de otoño'', which drew a direct comparison between the [[Red Army]], pushing Romania into an "armed peace", and the [[Wehrmacht]].<ref name="acpensador"/>

===Judaism, Zionism, Jewish culture===
Beginning in the late 1920s, Relgis was also a supporter of [[Zionism]], convinced that the path of [[Jewish assimilation]] was unsatisfactory for the affirmation of Jewish talents.<ref name="bmiudaistul"/> He also adhered to philosopher [[Martin Buber]]'s ideas about reuniting the three paths chosen by [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]]: universalism, Zionism and [[Conservative Judaism]].<ref name="gslvprolog"/> In his 1929 Avodah conference, he analyzed the ongoing Jewish resettlement into the [[Land of Israel]], and investigated the causes of violent clashes between Jewish migrants and the [[Palestinian people|Palestine Arabs]].<ref name="bmiudaistul"/> In other public statements, Relgis proudly stated his Judaic faith, noting that he had never actually left Judaism, "being integrated into its vast reality by the very reality of my own preoccupations, sociological and ethical, humanitarianist and pacifist."<ref name="gslvprolog"/> However, he explained to Iosif Gutman that joining a Zionist organization was not worth the effort, since membership was a form of captivity, and elsewhere suggested that Zionism was justified only as long as it did not follow "the restrictive methods of vulgar nationalism."<ref name="ddgsII, V"/> The writer also described himself as committed to [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and, as late as 1981, noted that [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was still his language of choice.<ref name="gslvprolog"/>

His essays on Judaism (some of which were dedicated to his father David)<ref name="bmiudaistul"/><ref name="ddgsV"/> speak about the threat of [[societal collapse]], which the author connected with mankind's spiritual decline after [[World War I]]. His theory on "[[dehumanization]]" postulated: "the spiritual evolution of mankind has proceeded to descent just as mankind is progressing in material terms."<ref name="bmiudaistul"/> As a reversal of this trend, Relgis proposed a return to the roots of Judaism, in whose [[monotheism]] and [[Messianism]] he decoded the basic representation of [[moral responsibility]], and the immediate precursors of [[Christianity]].<ref name="bmiudaistul"/><ref name="gslvprolog"/> The Romanian writer was interested in those aspects of [[Jewish ethics]] which anticipated humanitarianism or pacifism, citing the [[Bible]] as "that most humane book", and identifying himself with the lament of [[Malachi]] 2:10 ("Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?").<ref name="bmiudaistul"/> He later wrote that Jews, and [[Israel]]is in particular, were entrusted with keeping alive "the ancient wisdom, poetry and faith", with creating "new values from the old ones".<ref name="gslvprolog"/> Defining in his own terms the relationship between Biblical proto-universalism and 20th century humanitarianism, Relgis wrote: "Judaism is comprised into modern humanitarianism like a flame within a crystal globe."<ref name="ddgsIV"/><ref name="gslvprolog"/><ref name="rjpietreni"/> 

In tandem, he rejected those aspects of Judaism or Christianity which he believed where [[bigotry]], and his pacifist discourse criticized all religions as potential instigators or ideological props of hawkish rhetoric.<ref name="bmiudaistul"/><ref name="ddgsII"/> He reserved special criticism for the notions of a "vengeful God" and "[[Jews as a chosen people|Jewish chosenness]]", arguing that they are "primitive", and expressed more sympathy for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] universalism.<ref name="ddgsII"/> His texts, including the 1922 ''Apel către...'', are thought by some to be purposefully reusing the pro-universalist vocabulary of [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].<ref name="filosofiaer"/>

Relgis' Judaic-themed tracts cover a wide range of subjects. In several of them, Relgis concentrates on the Biblical prophet [[Moses]], in whom he sees the symbol of "great human aspirations".<ref name="gslvprolog"/> Some texts trace the impact of Moses' teaching on more modern authors (from [[Baruch Spinoza]] to [[Charles Darwin]]), others talk about [[secular Jewish culture]], and still others focus on individual Jewish personalities: Buber, [[Edmond Fleg]], [[Theodor Herzl]].<ref name="bmiudaistul"/> As a critic, he also investigated the survival of ancient Judaic themes in the [[modern art]] of [[Marcel Janco]], [[Lazăr Zin]] or [[Reuven Rubin]], and in the literature of Zweig, [[S. Ansky]], [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]] and even [[Marcel Proust]].<ref name="gslvprolog"/> Other such writings are individual portraits of Romanian Jewish men of letters, from [[A. L. Zissu]] and [[Iosif Brucǎr]] to [[Avram Steuerman-Rodion]] and [[Enric Furtună]].<ref name="gslvprolog"/> According to Geo Şerban, Relgis spent much of his later career promoting "a more fertile awareness of the links between Judaism and the modern world."<ref name="gslvprolog"/>

A critic of [[antisemitism]], Eugen Relgis also dedicated some of his main works in the essay genre to the cause of [[anti-fascism]]. Early on, he exposed claims about [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic domination]] as canards, and noted that antisemitism was a negative reaction to the Jews' own status as natural innovators in both politics and culture.<ref name="bmiudaistul"/> He wrote: "I take antisemitism to be that psychological disease whose manifestations display the characteristics of a [[phobia]], that is to say an [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]]. When someone is obsessed with an image, an individual or even a collective entity, these become the center of their world—and all causes and effects, no matter how far apart and different from each other, are connected to the initial obsession."<ref name="gslvprolog"/><ref name="ddgsV"/> 

Writing in 1946, shortly after the scale of [[The Holocaust]] became known to Romanian Jews, Relgis gave credit to the popular, but since challenged rumor that [[Soap made from human corpses|Nazis fabricated human soap]].<ref>Oişteanu, p.69</ref> Historian of ideas [[Andrei Oişteanu]] analyzes Relgis' text as more of a reaction to Nazism's own obsessive take on cleanliness, and writes that, at that time, Jews and Christians in Romania had been collecting certain brands of German soap and burying them as human remains.<ref>Oişteanu, p.69-70</ref>

===On Latin America===
After his move to Uruguay, Relgis developed a personal theory on [[Latin America]] as a "neohumanist" continent.<ref>Riose, ''passim''</ref> Earlier, in ''Europa cea tânără'', Relgis had claimed that the European continent needed to revisit its "pathetic history" of violence and imperialism, and reconvert by combining the lessons of [[Eastern philosophy]] and [[United States]] models of [[industrialization]].<ref name="ddgsVII"/> Both models, he warned, carried risks: Asia's "spiritual renunciations" were mirrored by a "cancer of machinism" in [[North America]].<ref name="ddgsVII"/>

With ''Perspectivas culturales en Sudamérica'', he expanded on a distinction between civilization and culture: the former as a transitory phase in human development, the latter as a permanent and characteristic sum of ideas; civilization, he argued, was in existence within the New World, but a [[Latin American culture]] was still ahead.<ref>Rose, p.12-13</ref> Relgis identified this as a merit, describing [[South America]] in general and Uruguay in particular as exceptionally fertile and a "healthier" example for the whole world, offering safe haven to independent thinkers and defying the ideological divisions of the [[Cold War]] era.<ref name="wr13-14">Rose, p.13-14</ref> Summarizing the future links between the Latin American regions and Europe as envisaged by Relgis, William Rose wrote: "the cultural mission of America consists in a careful selection of the eternal and universal values of Europe and their assimilation [...] to create typically American values that later, transcending the limits of this continent, will carry their message of peace and fraternity to the entire world."<ref name="wr13"/> Latin America, Relgis cautioned, should leave behind its own traditions of dictatorial government, fanaticism and "[[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] mentality", while fighting the "false moral" of North America; it could thus contribute to the cultural renaissance of a Europe corrupted by totalitarianism and imperialism.<ref name="wr13-14"/> Also important in Relgis' assessment was Latin America's capacity to resist modern dehumanization by granting a social role to its intellectuals, an idea impressed upon him by the writings of Uruguayan humanist [[José Enrique Rodó]].<ref>Rose, p.14</ref>

Relgis' theory was received with interest by some of his South American colleagues. One was [[Argentina|Argentine]] poet and historian [[Arturo Capdevila]], who wrote about Relgis as a "meritorious" visionary with a "grave and vital message", assuring him: "You can say from now on that you did not suffer in vain, gravely and deeply, the sorrows of the spirit. Your voice will be heard; all of your lesson will be applied."<ref name="wr12"/> Those Uruguayan public figures who paid homage to Relgis on his 60th anniversary included [[Socialist Party of Uruguay|Socialist Party]] leader [[Emilio Frugoni]], [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]] politician [[Amílcar Vasconcellos]], Zionist academic [[Joel Gak]] and poet [[Carlos Sabat Ercasty]].<ref name="acpensador"/> While comparing Relgis' pacifist message with the legendary warnings of [[Antigone]], Frugoni's praise was somewhat skeptical, noting that the Romanian's projects, however grand, could find themselves in disagreement with "the constricting reality".<ref name="acpensador"/> Reviewing such appraisals, Uruguayan philosopher Agustín Courtoisie calls Relgis "eccentric and genial", and sees in him a real-life version of characters in [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' [[fantasy literature]].<ref name="acpensador"/>

===Eugenics===
Like other intellectuals of his generation, Eugen Relgis believed that biology served to explain the background of "social and cultural problems that influence the intellectual movement."<ref name="pt162-163"/> Controversially, he merged his anarchist perspective with support for [[eugenics]], advocating universal [[birth control]] and [[compulsory sterilization]] in cases of "[[degeneration]]".<ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="aerlgitana"/><ref name="mt93-94">Turda, p.93-94</ref> According to Agustín Courtoisie: "Anarchist pacifism and the once fashionable eugenics seem to be the concepts one can associate with [Relgis]".<ref name="acpensador"/> In favoring this option, Relgis identified himself with those of his anarchist forerunners who were also dedicated [[Neo-Malthusianism|neo-Malthusians]], and especially with [[Manuel Devaldès]]. He praised Devaldès' call for [[vasectomy]] as a regulatory practice, calling the procedure "a true revolution" in population growth.<ref name="mt93-94"/> His works defended other anarchists who recommended the practice, including the tried anarchist eugenists Norbert Bardoseck and [[Pierre Ramus (anarchist)|Pierre Ramus]].<ref>Masjuan, p.406-407</ref> According to Romanian [[biomedicine]] historian Marius Turda, Relgis was among the social scientists who, in 1930s Romania, "forced [eugenic sterilization] into the realm of public debate".<ref name="mt93">Turda, p.93</ref> 

Turda also notes that ''Umanitarism şi eugenism'' went beyond sterilization advocacy to propose the [[involuntary euthanasia]] of "degenerate" individuals: those with "pathological characteristics or incurable diseases."<ref name="mt93"/> Relgis' call to action in eugenics came with a provision: "It is, however, preferable, from all points of view, that degenerates should not be born, or, even better, not conceived."<ref name="mt93"/> His views on this subject included an economic rationale, since, he argued, the community could not be expected to provide for sexually "prolific", but otherwise "degenerate", individuals.<ref name="filosofiaer"/> To this goal, he supported [[abortion]], both for eugenic and [[pro-choice]] reasons.<ref name="filosofiaer"/> Relgis also argued: "Instead of [[natural selection]], man should practice rational selection."<ref>Bucur, p.187</ref> With ''Las aberraciones sexuales...'', Relgis condemned [[Nazi eugenics]] as barbaric, but agreed that those identified as "[[Untermensch|sub-humans]]" needed to be reeducated and (if "incurable") sterilized by non-Nazi physicians.<ref name="filosofiaer"/>

In this context, Relgis identified [[multiracial]] society as a positive paradigm. The emergence of an exemplary Latin American culture was conceived by Relgis as running parallel to a [[Race of the Future|future American racial type]]. In this, Relgis saw the "integral man" of his humanitarianism, "healthy and strong", with a mind unbound by "super-refined culture", and without the traumatic experience of "tyrannical ideologies".<ref name="wr13"/> The idea, Rose noted, was somewhat similar to, but "more universal" than, the [[La Raza Cósmica|Cosmic Race theory]] of [[Mexico|Mexican]] academic [[José Vasconcelos]].<ref name="wr13"/>

==Literary contribution==
===Literary style and principles===
Eugen Relgis blended a critique of [[capitalism]], advocacy of internationalism and [[modern art]] interest with all his main contributions to literature. In his essays and "all too cerebral" novels, George Călinescu argues, Eugen Relgis was "obsessed with humanitarianism" and [[self-help]] techniques.<ref name="gc937"/> With his 1934 piece for ''[[Şantier]]'', Relgis divided the experience and nature of art into a primordial, collective, form and a newer, [[Individualism|individualist]] one: in the past, Relgis noted, creativity was consumed into creating vast anonymous works ("the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramid]], the temple, the cathedral"), often demanding "the silent and tenacious effort of successive generations."<ref name="vr2,1934"/> Presently, he thought, the combat against the "imperative of Profit" and "[[Economic materialism|vulgar materialism]]" justified the "ethical and [[Aesthetic relativism|aesthetic individualism]]". Relgis' essay described [[industrial society]] in harsh terms, as directed by "the bloody gods" of "Capitalism and War", and cautioned that the advocacy of anonymity in modern art could lead to [[kitsch]] ("serialized production, without the significance it used to carry in bygone days").<ref name="vr2,1934"/> Elsewhere, however, Relgis also argued that books needed to have a formative value, and that literature, unlike journalism, "needs to be the expression of length and depth."<ref name="ddgsIV"/>

Some of Relgis' preferences were shaped from his time at ''Fronda''. Its [[art manifesto]]s, described by [[Paul Cernat]] as "virtually illegible", announced radical ideals, such as [[art for art's sake]] through [[Great Fire of Rome|Neronian destruction]]: ''[[Qualis artifex pereo]]''.<ref name="pc56"/> [[Leon Baconsky]], a historian of Romanian Symbolism, notes that all ''Frondistes'' were at the time enthusiastic followers of French literary theorist [[Remy de Gourmont]], to whom Cernat adds philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] thinker [[Jean-Marie Guyau]] (both of them dedicated "prolix-metaphoric commentary" in the review's pages).<ref name="pc56"/> In matters of [[poetics]], the group declared its deep admiration for the loose Symbolism of [[Tudor Arghezi]] (whose poems were amply reviewed by all three ''Fronda'' issues) and, to a lesser extent, [[Ion Minulescu]]—according to Baconsky, ''Fronda'' was the first-ever voice in literary criticism to comment on Arghezi's work as an integral phenomenon.<ref name="pc56"/>

The cause of pacifism infused Relgis' work as a writer: a contemporary, the literary critic [[Pompiliu Păltânea]], believed that, with his contribution to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], Relgis was part of a diverse [[anti-war]] "ideological"  group of writers (alongside [[Felix Aderca]], [[Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voineşti]], [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]] and some others).<ref>{{fr icon}} [[Pompiliu Păltânea]], [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2019162/f237.image.r "Lettres roumaines"], in ''[[Mercure de France]]'', Nr. 576, June 1922, p.803 (digitized by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])</ref> According to Călinescu, Relgis' literary ideal became "the living book", the immediate and raw rendition of an individual's experience, with such "idols" as Rolland, Zweig, [[Henri Barbusse]], [[Heinrich Mann]] and [[Ludwig Rubiner]].<ref name="gc937"/> An additional influence was, according to poet-critic Boris Marian, European [[Expressionism]], in fashion at the start of Relgis' career.<ref name="bmiudaistul"/>

In addition to political essays and fiction, Relgis' prose includes contributions to [[travel literature]], deemed "his most characteristic works" by William Rose.<ref name="wr12"/> These writings include attempts by Relgis to illustrate in plastic terms the application of his ideology: [[Ion Clopoţel]] noted that, in his volume about interwar [[Bulgaria]], Relgis went beyond the facade of "savage" Bulgarian [[militarism]] to depict the humanist, vegetarian and "[[Tolstoyan movement|Tolstoyan]]" civil society of that age.<ref>Clopoţel (1933), p.168</ref> ''Bulgaria necunoscută'' also worked as a manifesto of [[anti-intellectualism]], chastising the "[[Demagogy|demagogue]]" academics and praising the simplicity of "collective life".<ref name="ic(33)169"/> In a similar way, Relgis' scattered [[memoir]]s, among them ''Strămoşul meu, "David Gugumanul"'' ("My Ancestor, 'Nitwit David' "), shed intimate light on his ideas about Judaism.<ref name="ddgsIII-IV"/><ref name="gslvprolog"/>

Other such [[Didacticism|didactic]] texts detail Relgis' advice on the art of living. ''Glasuri în surdină'' is noted for depicting the disorientation of a young man who becomes deaf: Relgis' [[alter ego]], Miron, finds that such a disability has turned his old friends into opportunistic exploiters, but his imaginative spirit and his (minutely chronicled) self-determination allow him to rebel and start over in life.<ref>Batson & Bergman, p.xi-xii, 206, 307-308</ref> However, deaf studies experts Trenton W. Batson and Eugene Bergman write, Miron "is not really representative of the deaf majority", leading a life of isolation and, out of despair, seeking out a miracle cure for deafness.<ref>Batson & Bergman, p.xii</ref> Relgis' patron [[Eugen Lovinescu]] was especially critical of the work, judging its "self-analyzing" [[internal monologue]] as burdensome.<ref>Lovinescu, p.238</ref>

The ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' ''Petru Arbore'' is noted by [[Geo Şerban]] as a "rarity" in Romanian literature, "instructive despite its excessive rhetoricism."<ref name="ddgsII"/> Eugen Lovinescu notes its traditional theme of social "inadaptation", which, to him, echoes the [[right-wing]] didacticism of ''[[Sămănătorul]]'' writers.<ref name="Lovinescu, p.237">Lovinescu, p.237</ref> Over the three volumes, the idealistic Arbore falls in love with women of various conditions, and, to the backdrop of World War I, tries to build a business as an army supplier.<ref name="Lovinescu, p.237"/> Relgis himself warned that the book should not be seen as his [[autobiography]], but as the "spiritual mirror" of each reader.<ref name="ddgsIV"/> Lovinescu believed the work to be heavily influenced by Rolland's ''[[Jean-Christophe]]'', lacking "inventiveness".<ref>Lovinescu, p.237-238</ref>

Called a "sweet volume of essays" by Clopoţel,<ref name="icmiron"/> ''Prieteniile lui Miron'' chronicles love and desire in relation to age and sex. The work shows a young girl losing and then regaining her faith in true love, a daring young man, "who mistakes love for sport", being rejected by his female companions, and lastly a mature couple whose love has undergone the test of friendship.<ref name="icmiron"/> Clopoţel praised the text for its "seriousness", "finesse" and "reflections enlightened by knowledge and responsibility", concluding: "[This is] a literature of moral health."<ref name="icmiron"/> 

These characteristics were also discerned by critics in his various contributions to [[Latin American literature]]. Courtoisie found ''Diario de otoño'', a book that is "miscellanious, multithematic, [moving] between the poetic and the everyday", comparable to the ''Fermentario'' essays of Uruguay's [[Carlos Vaz Ferreira]].<ref name="acpensador"/> According to critic William T. Starr, ''El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria'' and other such recollections reveal "more about Relgis than about Rolland".<ref>William T. Starr, "Romain Rolland", in Douglas W. Alden, Richard A. Brooks (eds.), ''A Critical Bibliography of French Literature: The Twentieth Century'', [[Syracuse University Press]], New York City, 1979, p.451-452, 463.  ISBN 0-8156-2204-X</ref>

===Poetry===
During his time at ''Fronda'', Eugen Relgis and his fellow writers published [[Collective poetry|collective]], [[Experimental literature|experimental]] and unsigned poems, largely echoing the influence of Arghezi and Minulescu, but, according to Cernat, "aesthetically monstrous".<ref name="pc56"/> This perspective is echoed by Şerban, who notes that Relgis' debut as a poet was largely without "convincing results".<ref name="ddgsII"/>  In ''Triumful nefiinţei'', the main stylistic reference was, according to Lovinescu, the Romanian Symbolist [[Prose poetry|prose poet]] [[Dimitrie Anghel]], imitated to the point of "[[pastiche]]".<ref>Lovinescu, p.100, 237</ref>

With time, Relgis developed a style deemed "the poetry of professions" by George Călinescu. According to Călinescu's classification, Relgis the poet is similar in this respect to fellow Symbolists [[Alexandru Tudor-Miu]] and [[Barbu Solacolu]], but also to [[Simona Basarab]], [[Leon Feraru]], [[Cristian Sârbu]] and [[Stelian Constantin-Stelian]].<ref name="gc937"/> The same critic notes that Relgis "attempted, with some beautiful poetic suggestions, to establish a modern-era mythology with abstract gods [...] and other machinist monsters."<ref name="gc936">Călinescu, p.936</ref> Lovinescu describes the poet in Relgis as one who "survived" through humanitarian propaganda, returning "in a compact [[Émile Verhaeren|Verhaeren]] form, rhetorical and accumulative."<ref>Lovinescu, p.100</ref> Lovinescu includes the resulting works in a category of "descriptive" and "social" poems, relating Relgis to Feraru, [[Alice Călugăru]], [[Aron Cotruş]], [[Vasile Demetrius]], [[Camil Petrescu]] and [[I. Valerian]].<ref>Lovinescu, p.98-104</ref>

Relgis' poems, Călinescu notes, were individual portraits of industrial machinery ("The Elevator", "The Cement Mixer") or workers ("The Builder", "The Day Laborer"), as temples and deities; by "natural association", the critic suggests, Relgis applied the same technique in his lyrical homages to the very large animals ("The Giraffe", "The Elephant"), but "this requires greater means of suggestion".<ref>Călinescu, p.936-937</ref> In one piece quoted by George Călinescu, Relgis showed a bricklayer contemplating the modern city from the top of a [[scaffolding]] structure:
{| width="100%"
|- valign="top" 
|
<poem>
De sus, pe schelele uşoare
Oraşul îl cuprind întreg,
Masiv şi dârz: —enormă stâncă
Ce-a fost ascunsă-n noapte-adâncă,
Şi care s-a ivit sub soare
Prin străduinţi a mii de ani—
Urcând încet, neînfrânat,
Prin forţa micilor titani.<ref name="gc936"/>
</poem>
|
<poem>
Up there, on flimsy scaffolds,
I stare all across this city,
Massive and daring: —enormous rock
That was hidden into deepest night
And reemerged under the sun,
Millennial efforts behind it—
Climbing slowly, ceaselessly,
Fed by the force of tiny titans.
</poem>
|
|}

==Legacy==
The political ideas of Eugen Relgis were largely incompatible with the totalitarianism prevalent in Romania between World War II and the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]]: as Rose notes, the scholar was persecuted by "four dictatorial regimes in his native country".<ref name="wr12"/> Before this, Şerban writes, Relgis' intellectual contacts may have stimulated public debate, even though the writer himself could not claim the status of "opinion maker".<ref name="ddgsII"/> Likewise, Boris Marian describes Relgis as "almost forgotten" by Romanians after his self-exile.<ref name="bmiudaistul"/> In addition to Iosif Gutman, Relgis' Jewish Romanian disciples included [[Fălticeni]] journalist Iacob Bacalu, founder of a Relgis Circle.<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html ''Fălticenii prin timp şi peste timp''], at the [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html Romanian Jewish Community site]; retrieved March 10, 2011</ref> According to literary historians such as Victor Frunză and [[Al. Săndulescu]], Relgis' targeting by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]] had a paradoxical antisemitic undertone, as one of the repressive measures which touched Jewish culture in general.<ref name="ascumsedistruge"/>

Attempts to recover Relgis' work were made during the latter half of Romanian communist rule and after the 1989, several of them from within the Romanian Jewish community. In April 1982, the Jewish cultural journal ''Revista Cultului Mozaic'' published [[Leon Volovici]]'s note about Relgis and Judaism.<ref name="ddgsIV"/><ref name="gslvprolog"/> Late in the 1980s, Volovici also contacted Relgis' surviving sisters, then Relgis himself, becoming curator of the manuscripts left behind by the philosopher upon his relocation to South America.<ref name="ddgsIV"/><ref name="gslvprolog"/> These were later donated to the [[Alexandru Al. Philippide]] Institute of the [[Romanian Academy]], where they are kept as the Eugen Relgis library fund.<ref name="ddgsIV"/><ref name="gslvprolog"/>

Relgis enjoys a more enduring reputation abroad. Initially, his anarchist eugenics enjoyed some popularity among [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]];<ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref>Turda, p.94</ref> his pacifism also inspired [[Llorenç Vidal Vidal]], the [[Balearic Islands|Balearic]] poet and educator.<ref>{{es icon}} [[Llorenç Vidal Vidal]], [http://ibdigital.uib.cat/greenstone/collect/premsaForanaMallorca/index/assoc/HASH01c1/2ee9b2cf.dir/doc.pdf "Mirador cultural.

By then, Relgis' works had been translated into fourteen languages, although they still remained largely unknown in the [[United States]];<ref name="wr12"/> ''Principiile umanitariste'' alone had been translated into some 18 languages before 1982.<ref name="gslvprolog"/><ref name="dllafjvl"/> The popularization of Relgis' ideas in America was first taken up by reviews such as ''[[The Humanist]]'' and ''[[Books Abroad]]'', while [[Oriole Press]] reprinted ''Muted Voices''.<ref>Rose, p.12. See also Batson & Bergman, p.344</ref> A second revised edition of ''Profetas y poetas'', prefaced by the Spanish intellectual [[Rafael Cansinos-Asséns]], saw print in Montevideo (1981).<ref name="acpensador"/> At around the same time, in Mexico, his poems were being reprinted in [[Alfonso Camín]]'s ''Norte'' literary review.<ref>{{es icon}} [http://www.hispanista.org/revista/norte/n1978/285/285.pdf "El lince", "Vana beatitud"], in ''Norte'', Nr. 285, p.26-27; [http://www.hispanista.org/revista/norte/n1978/286/286.pdf "En un lugar de los Andes"], in ''Norte'', Nr. 286, p.34-35; [http://www.hispanista.org/revista/norte/n1979/289/289.pdf "Ser rey"], in ''Norte'', Nr. 289, p.28; [http://www.hispanista.org/revista/norte/n1982/305/305.pdf "Mundo viejo"], in ''Norte'', Nr. 305, p.34; [http://www.hispanista.org/revista/norte/n1987/337/337.pdf "Ha muerto el gran humanista Eugene Relgis", "El lince"], in ''Norte'', Nr. 337, p.38-39; [http://www.hispanista.org/revista/norte/n1988/344/344.pdf "En un lugar de los Andes II"], in ''Norte'', Nr. 344, p.18-19 (digitized by the [http://www.hispanista.org/ Frente de Afirmación Hispanista])</ref>

In addition to the Philippide Institute collection, part of Relgis' personal archive is being preserved in [[Jerusalem]], at the [[National Library of Israel]].<ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="eriisg"/><ref name="gslvprolog"/> His other notebooks and letters are kept in the [[Netherlands]], at the [[International Institute of Social History]].<ref name="filosofiaer"/><ref name="eriisg"/> Relgis' likeness is preserved in drawings by [[Marcel Janco]],<ref name="bmiudaistul"/><ref name="ddgsI"/> [[Lazăr Zin]],<ref>Dorian & Şerban, p.III</ref> [[Louis Moreau]]<ref name="gslvprolog"/> and [[Carmelo de Arzadun]].<ref name="acpensador"/>
