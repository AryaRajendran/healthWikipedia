'''Molar pregnancy''' is an abnormal form of [[pregnancy]] in which a non-viable [[fertilized egg]] implants in the [[uterus]] and converts a normal pregnancy into an abnormal one (which will fail to come to term).
A molar pregnancy is a [[gestational trophoblastic disease]]<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/GestationalTrophoblasticDisease/DetailedGuide/gestational-trophoblastic-disease-what-is-g-t-d Gestational Trophoblastic Disease] at American Cancer Society.

A '''complete mole''' is caused by a single (90%) or two (10%) sperm combining with an egg which has lost its [[DNA]] (the sperm then reduplicates forming a "complete" 46 [[chromosome]] set) <ref name="Pathologic Basis of Disease">{{cite book |title=Pathologic Basis of Disease |year=2010|editor=Kumar, Vinay|edition=8th|pages=1057–1058 |isbn=1-4377-0792-0 |publisher=Saunders Elsevier}}</ref> The [[genotype]] is typically 46,XX ([[diploid]]) due to subsequent [[mitosis]] of the fertilizing sperm, but can also be 46,XY (diploid).<ref name="Pathologic Basis of Disease">{{cite book |title=Pathologic Basis of Disease |year=2010 |edition=8th|pages=1057–1058 |isbn=1-4377-0792-0 |publisher=Saunders Elsevier|author=Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N, Aster, JC}}</ref> 46,YY (diploid) is not observed. In contrast, a '''partial mole''' occurs when an egg is fertilized by two sperm or by one sperm which reduplicates itself yielding the genotypes of 69,XXY ([[triploid]]) or 92,XXXY ([[tetraploid]]).<ref name="Pathologic Basis of Disease"/>  Complete hydatidiform moles have a higher risk of developing into [[choriocarcinoma]] — a malignant tumor of [[trophoblast]] cells — than do partial moles.

The [[etymology]] is derived from ''hydatisia'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] "a drop of water"), referring to the watery contents of the cysts, and ''mole'' (from [[Latin]] ''mola'' = millstone/false conception).<ref>Entries HYDATID ''n.'' (''a.'') and MOLE, ''n.''<sup>6</sup> in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] online. (http://dictionary.oed.com/ &mdash; subscription required.)</ref>  The term, however, comes from the similar appearance of the cyst to a [[hydatid cyst]] in an [[Echinococcosis]].<ref>http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hydatidiform</ref>  

A hydatidiform mole conception may be categorized in medical terms as one type of non-induced (natural) "[[missed abortion]]"<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 2644599 | url = http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/1989/03000/Sonographic_Diagnosis_of_Partial_Hydatidiform_Mole.23.aspx | journal = [[Obstetrics & Gynecology (journal)|Obstet Gynecol]] | year = 1989 | month = March | volume = 73 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = 414–8 | title = Sonographic diagnosis of partial hydatidiform mole | last1 = Fine | first1= Calliope | last2 = Bundy | first2 = Albert L | last3 = Berkowitz | first3 = Ross S | last4 = Boswell | first4 = Steven B | last5 = Berezin | first5 = Andrew F | last6 = Doubilet | first = Peter M }}</ref> - referred to colloquially as a "missed miscarriage", because the pregnancy has become non-viable (miscarried) but was not immediately expelled (therefore was "missed").

==Natural history==
A hydatidiform mole is a pregnancy/[[conceptus]] in which the [[placenta]] contains grapelike vesicles (small sacs) that are usually visible with the naked eye. The vesicles arise by distention of the [[chorionic villi]] by fluid. When inspected in the microscope, [[hyperplasia]] of the [[trophoblastic]] tissue is noted. If left untreated, a hydatidiform mole will almost always end as a [[spontaneous abortion]] (miscarriage).

Based on [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], hydatidiform moles can be divided into two types: In ''complete moles'', all the [[chorionic villi]] are vesicular, and no sign of [[embryo]]nic or [[fetal]] development is present. In ''partial moles'' some villi are vesicular, whereas others appear more normal, and embryonic/fetal development may be seen but the fetus is always malformed and is never viable.

Hydatidiform moles are a common complication of pregnancy, occurring once in every 1000 pregnancies in the US, with much higher rates in Asia (e.g. up to one in 100 pregnancies in [[Indonesia]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Di Cintio E, Parazzini F, Rosa C, Chatenoud L, Benzi G |title=The epidemiology of gestational trophoblastic disease |journal=Gen Diagn Pathol |volume=143 |issue=2-3 |pages=103–8 |year=1997 |pmid=9443567 |doi=}}</ref>

In rare cases a hydatidiform mole co-exists in the uterus with a normal, viable fetus. These cases are due to [[twins|twinning]]. The uterus contains two conceptuses: one with an abnormal placenta and no viable fetus (the mole), and one with a normal placenta and a viable fetus. Under careful surveillance it is often possible for the woman to give birth to the normal child and to be cured of the mole.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sebire NJ, Foskett M, Paradinas FJ, ''et al.'' |title=Outcome of twin pregnancies with complete hydatidiform mole and healthy co-twin |journal=Lancet |volume=359 |issue=9324 |pages=2165–6 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12090984 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09085-2 |url=}}</ref>

The [[etiology]] of this condition is not completely understood. Potential risk factors may include defects in the egg, abnormalities within the [[uterus]], or nutritional deficiencies. Women under 20 or over 40 years of age have a higher risk. Other risk factors include diets low in [[protein]], [[folic acid]], and [[carotene]].<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000909|Hydatidiform mole}}</ref> The diploid set of sperm-only DNA means that all chromosomes have sperm-patterned [[methylation]] suppression of genes. This leads to overgrowth of the [[syncytiotrophoblast]] whereas dual egg-patterned methylation leads to a devotion of resources to the embryo, with an underdeveloped syncytiotrophoblast. This is considered to be the result of evolutionary competition with male genes driving for high investment into the fetus versus female genes driving for resource restriction to maximise the number of children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paoloni-Giacobino A. |title=Epigenetics in reproductive medicine |journal=Paediatr Res. |volume=May 61 |issue=5 Pt 2 |pages=51R–57R |year=2007 |pmid=17413849 |doi=10.1203/pdr.0b013e318039d978}}</ref>

===Parental origin===

In most complete moles, all [[nuclear gene]]s are inherited from the father only ([[androgenesis]]). In approximately 80% of these androgenetic moles, the most probable mechanism is that an empty [[ovum|egg]] is fertilized by a single [[sperm]], followed by a duplication of all [[chromosomes]]/genes (a process called "[[endoreduplication]]"). In approximately 20% of complete moles, the most probable mechanism is that an empty egg is fertilised by two sperm. In both cases, the moles are [[diploid]] (i.e. there are two copies of every chromosome). In all these cases, the [[mitochondrial]] genes are inherited from the mother, as usual.

Most partial moles are [[triploid]] (three chromosome sets). The nucleus contains one maternal set of genes and two paternal sets. The mechanism is usually the reduplication of the paternal [[haploid]] set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) [[fertilization]] of the egg.<ref name="Ten Teachers">{{cite book |title=Gynaecology by Ten Teachers |year=2006 |editor=Monga, Ash |edition=18th |pages=99–101 |isbn=0-340-81662-7 |publisher=Hodder Arnold}}</ref> 

In rare cases, hydatidiform moles are [[tetraploid]] (four chromosome sets) or have other chromosome abnormalities.

A small percentage of hydatidiform moles have biparental diploid genomes, as in normal living persons; they have two sets of chromosomes, one inherited from each biological parent. Some of these moles occur in women who carry [[mutation]]s in the gene ''[[NLRP7]]'', predisposing them towards molar pregnancy. These rare variants of hydatidiform mole may be complete or partial.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lawler SD, Fisher RA, Dent J |title=A prospective genetic study of complete and partial hydatidiform moles |journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol. |volume=164 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=1270–7 |year=1991 |month=May |pmid=1674641 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wallace DC, Surti U, Adams CW, Szulman AE |title=Complete moles have paternal chromosomes but maternal mitochondrial DNA |journal=Human Genetics |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=145–7 |year=1982 |pmid=6290372 |doi= 10.1007/BF00274205|url=http://www.springerlink.com/link.asp?id=w2555w4k4805h4h9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Slim R, Mehio A |title=The genetics of hydatidiform moles: new lights on an ancient disease |journal=Clin Genet. |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=25–34 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17204043 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2006.00697.x |url=}} Review.</ref>

==Clinical presentation and diagnosis==
Molar pregnancies usually present with painless vaginal bleeding in the fourth to fifth month of pregnancy.<ref name=Rob1110/> The [[uterus]] may be larger than expected, or the [[ovary|ovaries]] may be enlarged. There may also be more vomiting than would be expected ([[hyperemesis]]). Sometimes there is an increase in [[blood pressure]] along with protein in the urine. Blood tests will show very high levels of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG).<ref name=Ganong639>{{cite book |author=Ganong WF, McPhee SJ, Lingappa VR |title=Pathophysiology of Disease: An Introduction to Clinical Medicine (Lange) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |year=2005 |isbn=0-07-144159-X |page=639 }}</ref> 

The diagnosis is strongly suggested by [[ultrasound]] ([[medical ultrasonography|sonogram]]), but definitive diagnosis requires [[Histopathology|histopathological examination]].  On ultrasound, the mole resembles a bunch of grapes ("cluster of grapes" or "honeycombed uterus" or "snow-storm"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Woo J, Hsu C, Fung L, Ma H |title=Partial hydatidiform mole: ultrasonographic features |journal=Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=103–7 |year=1983 |pmid=6578773 |doi=10.1111/j.1479-828X.1983.tb00174.x}}</ref>). There is increased [[trophoblast]] proliferation and enlarging of the [[chorionic villi]].<ref name=oslo/> [[Angiogenesis]] in the trophoblasts is impaired as well.<ref name=oslo>[http://www.med.uio.no/studier/eksamen/medisin/sem9/oppgaver/2002/9-02-v-eng.rtf Oslo University] - Eksamensoppgaver i barnesykdommer; 9</ref>

Sometimes symptoms of [[hyperthyroidism]] are seen, due to the extremely high levels of hCG, which can mimic the normal [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH).<ref name=Ganong639/>

==Treatment==
Hydatidiform moles should be treated by evacuating the uterus by uterine suction or by surgical [[curettage]] as soon as possible after diagnosis, in order to avoid the risks of [[choriocarcinoma]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Cotran RS, Kumar V, Fausto N, Nelso F, Robbins SL, Abbas AK |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |edition=7th |page=1112}}</ref> Patients are followed up until their serum [[human chorionic gonadotrophin]] (hCG) level has fallen to an undetectable level. [[invasive hydatidiform mole|Invasive]] or metastatic moles ([[cancer]]) may require [[chemotherapy]] and often respond well to [[methotrexate]]. As they contain paternal [[antigens]], the response to treatment is nearly 100%. Patients are advised not to conceive for one year after a molar pregnancy. The chances of having another molar pregnancy are approximately 1%.

Management is more complicated when the mole occurs together with one or more normal [[fetus]]es.

[[Carboprost]] (PGF2α) medication may be used to contract the [[uterus]].

==Prognosis==
More than 80% of hydatidiform moles are [[benign]]. The outcome after treatment is usually excellent. Close follow-up is essential. Highly effective means of [[contraception]] are recommended to avoid pregnancy for at least 6 to 12 months.

In 10 to 15% of cases, hydatidiform moles may develop into invasive moles. This condition is named ''[[Gestational trophoblastic disease|persistent trophoblastic disease]]'' (PTD). The moles may intrude so far into the uterine wall that [[hemorrhage]] or other complications develop.  It is for this reason that a post-operative full abdominal and chest [[x-ray]] will often be requested.

In 2 to 3% of cases, hydatidiform moles may develop into [[choriocarcinoma]], which is a malignant, rapidly-growing, and [[metastasis|metastatic]] (spreading) form of cancer. Despite these factors which normally indicate a poor prognosis, the rate of cure after treatment with chemotherapy is high.

Over 90% of women with malignant, non-spreading cancer are able to survive and retain their ability to conceive and bear children. In those with metastatic (spreading) cancer, remission remains at 75 to 85%, although their childbearing ability is usually lost.

The prognosis of hydatidiform moles can be estimated by scoring systems such as the ''Modified WHO Prognostic Scoring System'', wherein scores between 1 and 4 from various parameters are summed together:<ref name=figo>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/gestationaltrophoblastic/HealthProfessional/page3 Stage Information for Gestational Trophoblastic Tumors and Neoplasia] at The National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in turn citing: FIGO Committee on Gynecologic Oncology.: Current FIGO staging for cancer of the vagina, fallopian tube, ovary, and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.
