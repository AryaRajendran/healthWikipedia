'''Semantic dementia''' (SD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of [[semantic memory]] in both the verbal and non-verbal domains. The most common presenting symptoms are in the verbal domain however (with loss of word meaning) and it is characterized  as a primary progressive aphasia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gorno-Tempini ML, Hillis AE, Weintraub S, ''et al.'' |title=Classification of primary progressive aphasia and its variants |journal=Neurology |volume=76 |issue=11 |pages=1006–14 |year=2011 |month=March |pmid=21325651 |pmc=3059138 |doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e31821103e6 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bonner MF, Ash S, Grossman M |title=The new classification of primary progressive aphasia into semantic, logopenic, or nonfluent/agrammatic variants |journal=Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=484–90 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=20809401 |pmc=2963791 |doi=10.1007/s11910-010-0140-4 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Harciarek M, Kertesz A |title=Primary progressive aphasias and their contribution to the contemporary knowledge about the brain-language relationship |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=271–87 |year=2011 |month=September |pmid=21809067 |pmc=3158975 |doi=10.1007/s11065-011-9175-9 |url=}}</ref>

SD patients sometimes show symptoms of surface dyslexia, a relatively selective impairment in reading low-frequency words with exceptional or atypical spelling-to-sound correspondences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Stephen|title=The neural basis of surface dyslexia in semantic dementia|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/132/1/71.abstract|publisher=Oxford Journals|accessdate=12 October 2011}}</ref> 

SD is one of the three canonical clinical syndromes associated with [[frontotemporal lobar degeneration]] (FTLD).  SD is a clinically defined syndrome, but is associated with predominantly temporal lobe atrophy (left greater than right) and hence is sometimes called temporal variant FTLD (tvFTLD).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weder ND, Aziz R, Wilkins K, Tampi RR |title=Frontotemporal dementias: a review |journal=Ann Gen Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue= |pages=15 |year=2007 |pmid=17565679 |pmc=1906781 |doi=10.1186/1744-859X-6-15 |url=}}</ref>

It was first described by Arnold Pick in 1904 but in modern times was characterised by Professor [[Elizabeth Warrington]] in 1975<ref>{{cite journal |author=Warrington EK |title=The selective impairment of semantic memory |journal=Q J Exp Psychol |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=635–57 |year=1975 |month=Nov |pmid=1197619 |doi=10.1080/14640747508400525 }}</ref> but was not given the name semantic dementia until 1989.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Snowden JS, Goulding PJ, Neary D |title=Semantic dementia: a form of circumscribed cerebral atrophy |journal=Behav Neurol |volume=2 |issue= |pages=167–82 |year=1989 }}</ref>  The association with temporal lobe atrophy was made by Professor John Hodges and colleagues in 1992 in a classic description of the clinical and neuropsychological features.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hodges JR, Patterson K, Oxbury S, Funnell E |title=Semantic dementia. Progressive fluent aphasia with temporal lobe atrophy |journal=Brain |volume=115 |issue=(Pt 6) |pages=1783–806 |year=1992 |month=Dec |pmid=1486461 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1486461 |doi=10.1093/brain/115.6.1783}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
SD patients often present with the complaint of word-finding difficulties. Clinical signs include [[fluent aphasia]], [[anomia]], impaired comprehension of word meaning, and [[associative visual agnosia]] (inability to match semantically related pictures or objects). As the disease progresses, behavioural and personality changes are often seen similar to those seen in [[frontotemporal dementia]] although cases have been described of 'pure' semantic dementia with few late behavioural symptoms.

==Neuropsychology==
Patients perform poorly on tests of semantic knowledge. Published tests include both verbal and non-verbal tasks, ''e.g.'', The Warrington Concrete and Abstract Word Synonym Test,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Warrington EK, McKenna P, Orpwood L |title=Single word comprehension: a concrete and abstract word synonym test |journal=Neuropsychological Rehabilitation |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=143–54 |month=Apr |year=1998 |doi=10.1080/713755564 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713755564~db=all~order=page}}</ref> and The Pyramids and Palm Trees task (Howard and Patterson, 1992)

Testing will also reveal deficits in picture naming (with semantic errors being made e.g. "dog" for a picture of a hippopotamus) and decreased category fluency.

==Imaging==
Structural MRI imaging shows a characteristic pattern of atrophy in the temporal lobes (predominantly on the left), with inferior greater than superior involvement and anterior temporal lobe atrophy greater than posterior. This distinguishes it from Alzheimer's disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chan D, Fox NC, Scahill RI, ''et al.'' |title=Patterns of temporal lobe atrophy in semantic dementia and Alzheimer's disease |journal=Ann Neurol. |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=433–42 |year=2001 |month=Apr |pmid=11310620 |doi=10.1002/ana.92 }}</ref> Meta-analyses on MRI and FDG-PET studies confirmed these findings by identifying alterations in the inferior temporal poles and amygdalae as the hotspots of disease - brain regions that have been discussed in the context of conceptual knowledge, semantic information processing, and social cognition.<ref name="pmid16327345">{{cite journal

}}</ref> Based on these imaging methods, semantic dementia can be regionally dissociated from the other subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, frontotemporal dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia.

==Pathology==
The majority of patients with SD will have ubiquitin-positive, TDP-43 positive, tau-negative inclusions, although other pathologies have been described more infrequently, namely tau-positive Pick's disease and Alzheimer's pathology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davies RR, Hodges JR, Kril JJ, Patterson K, Halliday GM, Xuereb JH |title=The pathological basis of semantic dementia |journal=Brain |volume=128 |issue=Pt 9 |pages=1984–95 |year=2005 |month=Sep |pmid=16000337 |doi=10.1093/brain/awh582 }}</ref>

==Genetics==
Of all the FTLD syndromes SD is least likely to run in families and is usually sporadic.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldman JS, Farmer JM, Wood EM, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of family histories in FTLD subtypes and related tauopathies |journal=Neurology |volume=65 |issue=11 |pages=1817–9 |year=2005 |month=Dec |pmid=16344531 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000187068.92184.63 }}</ref>

==Management==
There is currently no known curative treatment for this condition. Supportive care is essential in what is a greatly debilitating problem.
