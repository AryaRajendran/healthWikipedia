'''Fatigue''' (also called '''exhaustion''', '''tiredness''', '''lethargy''', '''languidness''', '''languor''', '''lassitude''', and '''listlessness''') is a subjective feeling of tiredness which is distinct from [[weakness]], and has a gradual onset. Unlike weakness, fatigue can be alleviated by periods of [[sleep|rest]]. Fatigue can have physical or mental causes. Physical fatigue is the transient inability of a [[muscle]] to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense [[physical exercise]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gandevia SC|title=Some central and peripheral factors affecting human motoneuronal output in neuromuscular fatigue|journal=Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)|volume=13|issue=2|pages=93–8 year=1992|pmid=1561512|doi=10.2165/00007256-199213020-00004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hagberg M|title=Muscular endurance and surface electromyogram in isometric and dynamic exercise|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–7|year=1981|pmid=7263402}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hawley JA, Reilly T|title=Fatigue revisited|journal=Journal of sports sciences|volume=15|issue=3|pages=245–6|year=1997|pmid=9232549|doi=10.1080/026404197367245}}</ref> Mental fatigue is a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity.

Medically, fatigue is a [[non-specific symptom]], which means that it has many possible causes. Fatigue is considered a [[symptom]], rather than a [[medical sign|sign]] because it is a subjective feeling reported by the patient, rather than an objective one that can be observed by others. Fatigue and ‘feelings of fatigue’ are often confused.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-440X(90)90018-N |author=Berrios GE |title=Feelings of fatigue and psychopathology: a conceptual history |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=140–51 |year=1990 |pmid=2178863 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0010-440X(90)90018-N}}</ref>

== Classification ==

=== Physical fatigue ===
{{Main|Muscle fatigue}}
Physical fatigue, or muscle fatigue, is the temporary physical inability of a muscle to perform optimally. The onset of muscle fatigue during physical activity is gradual, and depends upon an individual's level of physical fitness, and also upon other factors, such as [[sleep deprivation]] and overall health. It can be reversed by rest.<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web|title=Weakness and fatigue|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/weakness-and-fatigue-topic-overview|publisher=Healthwise Inc.|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref> Physical fatigue can be caused by a lack of energy in the muscle, by a decrease of the efficiency of the neuromuscular junction or by a reduction of the drive originating from the central nervous system.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gandevia SC |title=Spinal and supraspinal factors in human muscle fatigue |journal=Physiol. Rev. |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=1725–89 |year=2001 |pmid=11581501 }}</ref> The central component of fatigue is triggered by an increase of the level of [[serotonin]] in the central nervous system.  During motor activity, serotonin released in synapses that contact [[Motor neuron|motoneurons]] promotes muscle contraction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Perrier JF, Delgado-Lezama R |title=Synaptic release of serotonin induced by stimulation of the raphe nucleus promotes plateau potentials in spinal motoneurons of the adult turtle |journal=J Neurosci. |volume=25 |issue=35 |pages= 7993–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16135756 }}</ref> During high level of motor activity, the amount of [[serotonin]] released increases and a spillover occurs. [[Serotonin]] binds to extrasynaptic receptors located on the [[axon]] initial segment of [[Motor neuron|motoneurons]] with the result that [[Action potential|nerve impulse]] initiation and thereby muscle contraction are inhibited.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cotel F, Exley R, Cragg SJ, Perrier JF |title=Serotonin spillover onto the axon initial segment of motoneurons induces central fatigue by inhibiting action potential initiation |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=110 |issue=12 |pages= 4774–9 |year=2013 |pmid=23487756 }}</ref>

Muscle strength testing can be used to determine the presence of a [[neuromuscular disease]], but cannot determine its [[etiology]]. Additional testing, such as [[electromyography]], can provide diagnostic information, but information gained from muscle strength testing alone is not enough to diagnose most neuromuscular disorders.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Enoka|first=R. M.|coauthors=Duchateau, J.|title=Muscle fatigue: what, why and how it influences muscle function|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=11 October 2007|year=2008|month=January|volume=586|issue=1|pages=11–23|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2007.139477|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>

[[Musculoskeletal system|Musculoskeletal]] structures may have co-evolved with their corresponding brain structures in a way that allows them to adapt to environmental conditions (e.g.—[[proprioception]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=Edelman, Gerald Maurice |title=The remembered present: a biological theory of consciousness |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1989 |isbn=0-465-06910-X }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Kelso, J. A. Scott |title=Dynamic patterns: the self-organization of brain and behavior |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1995 |isbn=0-262-61131-7 }}</ref><!--This information is irrelevant to fatigue....-->

=== Mental fatigue ===
Mental fatigue is a temporary inability to maintain optimal cognitive performance. The onset of mental fatigue during any cognitive activity is gradual, and depends upon an individual's cognitive ability, and also upon other factors, such as sleep deprivation and overall health. Mental fatigue has also been shown to decrease physical performance.<ref name="Marcora 2009 857–864"/> It can manifest as [[somnolence]], [[wikt:lethargy|lethargy]], or [[directed attention fatigue]]. Decreased attention is known as [[ego depletion]] and occurs when the limited 'self-regulatory capacity' is depleted.<ref>Baumeister, R. F. (2002). Ego Depletion and Self-Control Failure: An Energy Model of the Self’s Executive Function. Self and Identity, 1, 129-136.</ref> It may also be described as a more or less decreased [[level of consciousness]].<ref>AJ Giannini  Fatigue,Chronic.  In RB Taylor  Difficult Diagnosis--2. Philadelphia, WB Saunders Co.,1992,pg 156.  ISBN 0-7216-3481-8</ref> In any case, this can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as operating large vehicles. For instance, a person who is sufficiently somnolent may experience [[microsleep]]. However, objective cognitive testing can be used to differentiate the neurocognitive deficits of brain disease from those attributable to tiredness.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}<!--It would also be interesting to read more about the ways in which the [[neurocognitive]] deficits of caused by fatigue differ from those caused by tiredness-->

The [[perception]] of mental fatigue is believed to be modulated by the brain's [[reticular activating system]](RAS).
<!--The RAS is implicated primarily in mediation of ''somnolence'', but I'll leave this comment here for now.-->

== Fatigue vs. sleepiness ==
Fatigue is generally considered a more long-term condition than sleepiness ([[somnolence]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shen|first=Jianhua|coauthors=Joseph Barbera, Colin M. Shapiro|title=Distinguishing sleepiness and fatigue: focus on definition and measurement|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|year=2006|month=February|volume=10|issue=1|pages=63–76|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079205000444|accessdate=22 February 2012|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2005.05.004}}</ref> Although sleepiness can be a [[symptom]] of medical issues, it usually results from lack of restful sleep, or a lack of [[stimulation]]

Dement|title=Quantification of Sleepiness: A New Approach|journal=Psychophysiology|date=30|year=2007|month=Jan|volume=10|issue=4|pages=431–436|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1973.tb00801.x/abstract|accessdate=23 February 2012|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1973.tb00801.x}}</ref> Chronic fatigue, on the other hand, is a symptom of a greater medical problem in most cases. It manifests in mental or physical weariness and inability to complete tasks at normal performance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wessely|first=S.|coauthors=M Hotopf, M Sharpe|title=Chronic fatigue and its syndromes|journal=BMJ|date=9|year=1999|month=Jan|volume=318|pages=416|url=http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articles/PMC1114599/reload=0;jsessionid=m5Iwq2Mir0fcMzZppwaQ.23|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref> Both are often used interchangeably and even categorized under the description of 'being tired.'

==Causes==
Fatigue is a normal result of [[labour (economics)|work]]ing, mental [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], overstimulation and understimulation, [[jet lag]] or active [[recreation]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], and also [[boredom]], [[disease]] and [[Sleep deprivation|lack of sleep]]. It may also have chemical causes, such as [[poison]]ing or [[mineral]] or [[vitamin]]  deficiencies. Massive blood loss frequently results in fatigue. Fatigue is different from drowsiness, where a patient feels that sleep is required. Fatigue is a normal response to physical exertion or stress, but can also be a sign of a physical disorder.

Temporary fatigue is likely to be a minor [[illness]] like the [[common cold]] as one part of the [[sickness behavior]] response that happens when the [[immune system]] fights an [[infection]].

===Chronic fatigue===
''Prolonged fatigue'' is a self-reported, persistent (constant) fatigue lasting at least one month. ''Chronic fatigue'' is a self-reported fatigue lasting at least six consecutive months. Chronic fatigue may be either persistent or relapsing.<ref name="CDC1994">{{cite journal

== Diagnosis ==

One study concluded about 50% of people who have fatigue receive a diagnosis that could explain the fatigue after a year with the condition.  In those people who have a possible diagnosis, musculoskeletal (19.4%) and psychological problems (16.5%) are the most common.  Definitive physical conditions were only found in 8.2%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nijrolder I, van der Windt D, de Vries H, van der Horst H |title=Diagnoses during follow-up of patients presenting with fatigue in primary care |journal=CMAJ |volume=181 |issue=10 |pages=683–7 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19858240 |pmc=2774363 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.090647 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19858240}}</ref>

If a person with fatigue decides to seek medical advice, the overall goal is to identify and rule out any treatable conditions.  This is done by considering the person's [[medical history]], any other symptoms that are present, and evaluating of the qualities of the  fatigue itself.  The affected person may be able to identify patterns to the fatigue, such as being more tired at certain times of day, whether fatigue increases throughout the day, and whether fatigue is reduced after taking a nap.

Because disrupted [[sleep]] is a significant contributor to fatigue, a diagnostic evaluation considers the quality of sleep, the [[emotional]] state of the person, sleep pattern, and stress level. The amount of sleep, the hours that are set aside for sleep, and the number of times that a person awakens during the night are important.  A [[sleep study]] may be ordered to rule out a [[sleep disorder]].

[[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] and other psychological conditions can produce fatigue, so people who report fatigue are routinely screened for these conditions, along with [[drug abuse]], poor diet, and lack of [[physical exercise]], which paradoxically increases fatigue.

Basic [[medical tests]] may be performed to rule out common causes of fatigue.  These include [[blood tests]] to check for infection or [[anaemia]], a [[urinalysis]] to look for signs of [[liver disease]] or [[diabetes mellitus]], and other tests to check for kidney and liver function, such as a [[comprehensive metabolic panel]].<ref>EMedicine Health. [http://www.emedicinehealth.com/fatigue/page5_em.htm#Exams%20and%20Tests "Fatigue Exams and tests"] 2010-01-25.</ref>  Other tests may be chosen depending on the patient's social history, such as an [[HIV test]] or [[pregnancy test]].
