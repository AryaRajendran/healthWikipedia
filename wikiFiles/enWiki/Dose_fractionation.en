[[Experiments]] in [[radiation biology]] have found that as the [[absorbed dose]] of [[radiation]] increases, the number of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] which survive decreases. They have also found that if the radiation is ''fractionated'' into smaller [[Gray (unit)|doses]], with one or more rest periods in between, fewer cells [[cell death|die]]. This is because of [[DNA repair|self-repair mechanisms]] which repair the damage to [[DNA]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/D/DNArepair.html|title=DNA repair|author=John Kimball|date=8 April 2012|accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/aging.html#dna|title=Mechanisms of Aging|author=Ben Best|accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> and other biomolecules such as [[proteins]]. These  mechanisms can be over expressed in [[cancer]] cells, so caution should be used in using results for a cancer cell line to make predictions for healthy cells if the cancer cell line is known to be resistant to [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxic drugs]] such as [[cisplatin]]. The [[DNA repair|DNA self repair]] processes in some organisms is exceptionally good; for instance, the bacterium [[Deinococcus radiodurans]] can tolerate a 15&nbsp;000&nbsp;Gy (1.5&nbsp;MRad) dose.

In the graph below, called a [[cell survival curve]], the dose vs. surviving fraction have been drawn for a [[hypothetical]] group of cells with and without a rest time for the cells to recover. Other than the recovery time partway through the irradiation, the cells would have been treated identically.

[[Image:Effectofselfrepair.png|center|600px|This is a graph showing the effect of fractionation on the ability of [[gamma rays]] to cause cell death. The blue line is for cells which were not given a chance to recover; the red line is for cells which were allowed to stand for a time and recover.]]

The [[human body]] contains many types of cells, and the human can be killed by the loss of a single type of cells in a vital [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]. For many short-term radiation deaths due to what is commonly known as [[radiation sickness]] (3 days to 30 days after exposure), it is the loss of [[bone marrow]] cells (which produce [[blood cells]]), and the loss of other cells in the wall of the [[intestines]], that is fatal.

== Radiation fractionation as cancer treatment ==
Fractionation also refers to a method of treating [[cancer]] with [[radiation therapy]]. When the total dose of [[radiation]] is divided into several, smaller doses over a period of several days, there are fewer [[toxic]] effects on healthy cells. This maximizes the effect of radiation on cancer and minimizes the negative [[side effects]].  Typical fractionation schemes divide the dose into 30 units delivered every weekday over 6 weeks, though current research is considering the benefits of accelerated fractionation (2 deliveries per day and/or deliveries on weekends as well).
Hypofractionation is a treatment regimen that delivers higher doses of radiation in fewer visits. The logic behind this treatment is that applying greater amounts of radiation works to lower the effects of accelerated tumor growth that typically occurs during the later stages of radiotherapy.<ref>Pollack, Alan, and Mansoor Ahmed .
