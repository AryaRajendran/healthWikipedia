'''Alegent Health System''' is a [[non-profit]], faith based health organization with headquarters in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. 

== Hospitals ==
Alegent Health is made up of ten acute care hospitals, five of which are located in the [[Omaha metro area]]. [[Bergan Mercy Medical Center]], [[Immanuel Medical Center]], [[Lakeside Hospital]], [[Midlands Hospital]] and [[Mercy Hospital (Council Bluffs, Iowa)|Mercy Hospital]] in neighboring [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]. Alegent Health has more than 100 sites of service, with over 1,300 physicians on its medical staff and roughly 9,000 employees.

== History ==
Alegent Health is sponsored by [[Catholic Health Initiatives]] and Immanuel Health Systems. It was created in 1996, resulting from a long-standing partnership between Immanuel Medical Center and Bergan Mercy Medical Center under the Community Health Vision. Both boards unanimously approved the union. The campuses joined together along with Mercy Hospital in Council Bluffs, Iowa and two regional health partners, Corning and Schuyler, as one health care system while maintaining their own identities and religious affiliations. In 1997, Midlands Hospital joined Alegent Health. In 2004, [[Lakeside Hospital (Omaha)|Lakeside Hospital]], the first full-service hospital in west Omaha was opened. In 2008, Alegent Health broke ground on a $315 million renovation/expansion project dubbed 
"Generation Patient" at all five of its metro hospital campuses, which are expected to be completed in 2011.
