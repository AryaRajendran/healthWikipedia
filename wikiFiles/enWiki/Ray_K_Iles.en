==Personal details==

Ray K Iles was born in [[Barnes, London]], as Raymond Kruse. His father died in 1967; his and his brother's names were subsequently changed by [[deed poll]] to Kruse Iles to reflect their mother’s re-marriage.  His genetic family traces back to immigration of Germans and Danes from [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and London in particular, at the time of the [[First Schleswig War|Schleswig-Holstein War]] of 1850 and Bismarck’s campaign to unite the German states in the Reich. The Kruses were [[Cabinet making|cabinetmakers]], settling in Huntley Street behind [[Tottenham Court Road]]. Ray (Kruse) Iles’s tracing of his German cabinet-making ancestors resulted in his discovery that the British Olympic [[Fencing]] competitor - Richard Kruse - was his direct cousin. This was confirmed by [[Genetic genealogy#Y chromosome (Y-DNA) testing|Y chromosome genetic marker testing]] and featured on the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''Tracing Your Roots''.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/tracingyourroots_20070908.shtml BBC Radio 4 ''Tracing Your Roots''] (8 September 2007)</ref>
