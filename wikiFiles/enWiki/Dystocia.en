Dystocia may arise due to incoordinate uterine activity, abnormal fetal lie or presentation, absolute or relative [[cephalopelvic disproportion]], or (rarely) a massive fetal tumor such as a [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]]. [[Oxytocin]] is commonly used to treat incoordinate uterine activity, but [[pregnancy|pregnancies]] complicated by dystocia often end with assisted deliveries, including [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps]], [[ventouse]] or, commonly, [[caesarean section]].  Recognized complications of dystocia include fetal death, respiratory depression, [[hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy]] (HIE), and brachial nerve damage. A prolonged interval between pregnancies, primigravid birth, and multiple birth have also been associated with increased risk for labor dystocia.<ref name="Zhu" />

[[Shoulder dystocia]] is a dystocia in which the anterior shoulder of the infant cannot pass below the [[pubic symphysis]] or requires significant manipulation to pass below it. It can also be described as delivery requiring additional manoeuvres after gentle downward traction on the head has failed to deliver the shoulders.

A prolonged second stage of labour is another type of dystocia whereby the fetus has not been delivered within three hours in a nulliparous woman, or two hours in multiparous woman, after her cervix has become fully dilated.  

Synonyms for dystocia include difficult labour, abnormal labour, difficult childbirth, abnormal childbirth, and dysfunctional labour.</onlyinclude>

The term can also be used in the context of various animals. Dystocia pertaining to birds and reptiles is also called [[egg binding]].
