'''Medical cannabis''' refers to the parts of the herb [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] used as a physician-recommended form of medicine or [[herbalism|herbal therapy]], or to synthetic forms of specific [[cannabinoids]] such as [[THC]] (delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol) as a physician-recommended form of medicine. The [[cannabis|''Cannabis'' plant]] has a long history of use as medicine, with legendary evidence dating back to the Emperor [[Shennong|Shen Nung]] in 2737 [[BCE]].<ref name="Amar2006">{{Cite journal |author = Mohamed Ben Amar |title = Cannabinoids in medicine: A review of their therapeutic potential |journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume = 105 |issue = 1–2 |pages = 1–25 |year = 2006 |doi = 10.1016/j.jep.2006.02.001 |url = http://www.doctordeluca.com/Library/WOD/WPS3-MedMj/CannabinoidsMedMetaAnalysis06.pdf |accessdate = 8 April 2010 |pmid = 16540272}}</ref> Cannabis is one of the [[50 Fundamental Herbs|50 "fundamental" herbs]] of [[traditional Chinese medicine]],<ref name="Wong">{{Cite book|last=Wong |first=Ming |year=1976 |title=La Médecine chinoise par les plantes |publisher=Tchou |location=Paris |oclc=2646789}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref> and is prescribed for a broad range of indications.

= INTRO NOTE ON FDA =========================

|  Many in-good-faith editors have attempted to add an intro sentence

|  WORLDWIDE, not just the US. Including information on just one

== Difference between ''C. indica'' and ''C. sativa'' ==
[[Image:Cannab2 new.png|thumb|right|''Cannabis sativa'', ''Cannabis indica'', and ''Cannabis ruderalis'']]

''[[Cannabis indica]]'' may have a [[Cannabidiol|CBD]]:[[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] ratio ''-4:5'' times that of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]''. Cannabis strains with relatively high CBD:THC ratios are less likely to induce [[anxiety]] than vice versa. This may be due to CBD's [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]]ic effects at the [[cannabinoid receptor]]s, compared to THC's [[partial agonist]] effect. CBD is also a [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] agonist, which may also contribute to an anxiolytic effect.<ref name="joy">{{Cite book| title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing The Science Base | author= Joy, J.

Conversely, the ''Cannabis indica'' plant is known to cause more of a "stoned" or meditative feeling, possibly because of a higher CBD to THC ratio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.growery.org/3032/Indica-Sativa-Whats-the-difference |title=Indica? Sativa? What's the difference? |publisher=Growery|accessdate=2011-02-17}}</ref> The primary effects of ''sativas'' are on the mind and emotions. These benefits can be particularly helpful for the psychological aspects of many illnesses, giving people an increased sense of well-being. Due to the stimulating nature of ''sativas'', they are generally better for daytime use. Caution should also be taken for people experiencing heightened anxiety or those with mental health conditions.<ref name="Sativa">{{cite web|url=http://www.kingstoncompassion.org/horticulture/strains/|title=Medical Cannabis Information|work=Sativa}}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> However, this association is contradicted by more recent research which suggests that CBD increases alertness.

Medical cannabis is illegal in most countries. A number of governments, including the U.S. Federal Government, allow treatment with one or more specific low doses of synthetic [[cannabinoids]] for one or more disorders. However, public opinion in several areas, including the United States, is swinging in favor of use of medical cannabis, especially for chronically ill patients. The topic is one of great controversy and is being debated more than ever.

There are several methods for [[Route of administration|administration of dosage]], including [[vaporizer (cannabis)|vaporizing]] or smoking dried buds, drinking, or eating extracts, and taking capsules. The comparable efficacy of these methods was the subject of an investigative study<ref name="medmjscience1">{{cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/news/medmarijuana/MedicalMarijuana.htm |title=Workshop on the Medical Utility of Marijuana |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] |year=1997 |accessdate=26 April 2009}}</ref> conducted by the [[National Institutes of Health]].

Synthetic cannabinoids are available as prescription drugs in some countries. Examples are [[Marinol#Marinol|Marinol]] (The United States and Canada) and [[nabilone|Cesamet]] (Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

While utilizing cannabis for recreational purposes is illegal in many parts of the world, many countries are beginning to entertain varying levels of decriminalization for medical usage, including Canada, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Spain, Israel, Italy, Finland, and Portugal. In the United States, federal law outlaws all use of herb parts from Cannabis; States that have approved use of medical cannabis are in conflict with federal law. The [[United States Supreme Court]] has ruled in ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop]]'' and ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' that the federal government has a right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes. A person can therefore be prosecuted for a cannabis-related crime even if it is legal medical use according to state laws. The US federal government, through the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA), continues to provide medical cannnabis to 4 patients who participated in the [[Compassionate Investigational New Drug Program]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Sixth National Clinical Conference on Cannabis Therapeutics: A Report on the 2010 Conference |author=Mark Mathew Braunstein |url=http://www.markbraunstein.org/articles/braunstein-cannabis-conference.pdf |date=2010 |publisher=Treating Yourself |issue=Issue 23, 2010 |quote=He is one of only four remaining patients whose cannabis is still provided by the federal government under its now disbanded Investigational New Drug (IND) program.}}</ref> NIDA claims this is done for "compassionate purposes" and the US federal government still maintains that medical marijuana is not an effective or desirable treatment for any medical condition despite significant contrary evidence.

A 2002 review of [[medical literature]] by Franjo Grotenhermen states that medical cannabis has established effects in the treatment of nausea, vomiting, [[premenstrual syndrome]], unintentional [[weight loss]], [[insomnia]], and [[Anorexia (symptom)|lack of appetite]]. Other "relatively well-confirmed" effects were in the treatment of "[[spasticity]], painful conditions, especially [[Nervous system|neurogenic pain]], [[movement disorder]]s, [[asthma]], <nowiki>[and]</nowiki> [[glaucoma]]".<ref name="groten">{{Cite book|last=Grotenhermen |first=Franjo |chapter=Review of Therapeutic Effects |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=JvIyVk2IL_sC&pg=PA123 |title=Cannabis and Cannabinoids: Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutic Potential |publisher=[[Haworth Press]] |location=New York City |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7890-1508-2 |page=124}}</ref>

A study done by Craig Reinarman surveyed people in California who used cannabis found they did so for many reasons. Reported uses were for pain relief, muscle spasms, headaches, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, depression, cramps, panic attacks, diarrhea, and itching. Others used cannabis to improve sleep, relaxation, appetite, concentration or focus, and energy. Some patients used it to prevent medication side effects, anger, involuntary movements, and seizures, while others used it as a substitute for other prescription medications and alcohol.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=21858958|author=Reinarman, C|year=2011|journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs|volume=43|issue=2|pages=128–135|title=Who Are Medical Marijuana Patients?

Indeed, marijuana may be a much more common cause of myocardial infarction than is generally recognized. In day-to-day practice, a history of marijuana use is often not sought by many practitioners, and even when sought, the patient's response is not always truthful.

Regarding the relative safety of cannabis, former US [[DEA]] chief administrative law judge Judge Francis Young said:
	 
:"There is no record in the extensive medical literature describing a proven, documented cannabis-induced fatality....Despite [a] long history of use and the extraordinarily high numbers of social smokers, there are simply no credible medical reports to suggest that consuming marijuana has caused a single death.

===Pain relief===
The effectiveness of cannabis as an [[analgesic]] has been the subject of numerous studies. [[University of Oxford]] doctors found that the brain on THC showed reduced response to pain, suggesting that the the drug may help patients endure pain. Brain scans showed reduced activity in two centers of the brain where pain is registered: The mid-[[Anterior cingulate cortex]] and the right [[Amygdala]]. However, cannabis did not block the sensation of pain like [[morphine]]-based pain killers.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/cannabis-chemical-chills-out-reaction-to-pain-121221.html |title=Marijuana chemical chills out brain's pain threshold |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref> The researchers also found a great degree of variation among individual reports of pain relief.<ref>{{citation |last=Pedersen |first=Traci |url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2012/12/29/marijuana-pain-relief-varies-among-users/49770.html |title=Marijuana pain relief varies among users |publisher=Psychcentral.com |date=29 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref> 

According to Stuart Silverman, M.D., a [[rheumatologist]] at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]], "Historically and anecdotally, marijuana has been used as a painkiller".<ref>{{citation |author=Anne Harding |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/22/medical.marijuana/index.html |title=Medical marijuana may help fibromyalgia pain |publisher=CNN |date=22 February 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref> A Canadian study showed cannabis can reduce "nerve pain" from surgical complications or injuries.

Grant explained further that not everyone experienced pain relief, but the percentage of people who did was comparable to those who said that they experienced relief from other medications commonly prescribed for neuropathic pain (the subject of his study), such as [[antidepressants]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/18/marijuana-provides-pain-r_n_466993.html |title=Marijuana provides pain relief, new study says |work=Huffington Post |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref> 

A small-scale [[UCSF]] study found that patients with chronic pain may experience greater relief if [[cannabinoids]] were added to an opiate-only treatment regime. The findings further suggested that combination therapy could result in reduced opiate dosages.<ref>{{citation |last=Kim |first=Leland |url=http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2011/12/11077/ucsf-study-finds-medical-marijuana-could-help-patients-reduce-pain-opiates |title=UCSF study finds medical marijuana could help patients reduce pain with opiates |publisher=ucsf.edu |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref> The College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, U.S. published a study in the ''Neuropsychopharmacology'' journal in 2013 that is based on research that was conducted with fifteen males and fifteen females who smoked marijuana every day. The study's subjects were exposed to either a placebo, inhaled marijuana, or dronabinol, a pill that contains cannabis' psychoactive ingredient. Participants were monitored to ensure that they had not smoked in the time period immediately prior to the tests and did not have other drugs (including alcohol) in their systems. The researchers concluded that “Dronabinol administration decreased pain sensitivity and increased pain tolerance that peaked later and lasted longer relative to smoked marijuana”, thereby providing evidence that the pill form was superior to smoked cannabis in terms of pain relief efficacy. However, the Columbia researchers further stated, "A primary caveat of the current findings is that the study population consisted of daily marijuana smokers; this study limitation should be considered when interpreting the findings and placing them within the context of the potential therapeutic feasibility of cannabinoids [for the general population]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Study of daily users shows marijuana pills trump smoked marijuana for pain relief|url=http://theconversation.com/study-of-daily-users-shows-marijuana-pills-trump-smoked-marijuana-for-pain-relief-13664?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Latest+from+The+Conversation+for+24+April+2013&utm_content=Latest+from+The+Conversation+for+24+April+2013+CID_62b60f5e455b9427d023336690a13f46&utm_source=campaign_monitor&utm_term=Study%20of%20daily%20users%20shows%20marijuana%20pills%20trump%20smoked%20marijuana%20for%20pain%20relief|work=The Conversation Australia|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=24 April 2013|author=Sunanda Creagh|date=23|month=April|year=2013}}</ref>

=== Glaucoma ===
[[File:Compassion1.jpg|thumb|right|Medical cannabis in edible form]]

In [[glaucoma]], cannabis and THC have been shown to reduce intra-ocular pressure (IOP) by an average of 24% in people with normal IOP who have visual-field changes. In studies of healthy adults and glaucoma patients, IOP was reduced by an average of 25% after smoking a cannabis "cigarette" that contained approximately 2% THC—a reduction as good as that observed with most other medications available today, according to a review by the [[Institute of Medicine]].<ref>{{Cite book |editor1-first=Janet E. |editor1-last=Joy |editor2-first=Stanley J. |editor2-last=Watson |editor3-first=John A. |editor3-last=Benson |year=1999 |title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6376&page=173 |publisher=[[National Academies Press]] |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-07155-0 |oclc=246585475}}</ref>

In a separate study, the use of cannabis and glaucoma was tested and found that the duration of smoked or ingested cannabis or other cannabinoids is very short, averaging 3 to 3.5 hours. Their results showed that for cannabis to be a viable therapy, the patient would have to take in cannabis in some form every 3 hours. They said that for ideal glaucoma treatment it would take two times a day at most for compliance purposes from patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kaufman, Paul. |year=1998 |title=Marijuana and Glaucoma |journal=Archives of Ophthalmology |volume=116 |issue=11 |pages=1512–13 |url=http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=116&issue=11&page=1512 |doi=10.1001/archopht.116.11.1512}}</ref>

=== Spasticity in multiple sclerosis ===

A review of six [[randomized controlled trials]] of a combination of [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] and [[Cannabidiol|CBD]] extracts for the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) related muscle spasticity reported, "Although there was variation in the outcome measures reported in these studies, a trend of reduced spasticity in treated patients was noted." The authors postulated that "cannabinoids may provide neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory benefits in MS."<ref name=Lakhan>{{cite journal |author = Lakhan SE, Rowland M |year = 2009 |title = Whole plant cannabis extracts in the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review |journal = BMC Neurology |volume = 9 |page = 59 |pmid = 19961570 |pmc = 2793241 |doi=10.1186/1471-2377-9-59}}</ref> A small study done on whether or not cannabis could be used to control tremors of MS patients was conducted. The study found that there was no noticeable difference of the tremors in the patients. Although there was no difference in the tremors the patients felt as if their symptoms had lessened and their quality of life had improved. The researchers concluded that the mood enhancing or cognitive effects that cannabis has on the brain could have given the patients the effect that their tremors were getting better.<ref name="De-Vries 2010 2454–2462"/><ref name="AMAnews"/>

=== Alzheimer's disease ===
[[File:Cannabis sativa (16).jpg|thumb|right|[[Cannabinoids]] found in medical cannabis prevent or inhibit the progression of [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="alz"/><ref name=Campbell/>]]

Research done by the [[Scripps Research Institute]] in California shows that the active ingredient in marijuana, [[THC]], prevents the formation of deposits in the brain associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. THC was found to prevent an enzyme called [[acetylcholinesterase]] from accelerating the formation of "Alzheimer plaques" in the brain more effectively than commercially marketed drugs. THC is also more effective at blocking clumps of protein that can inhibit memory and cognition in Alzheimer's patients, as reported in [[Molecular Pharmaceutics]].<ref name="alz">{{Cite journal|author=Eubanks LM |title=A Molecular Link Between the Active Component of Marijuana and Alzheimer's Disease Pathology |journal=Molecular Pharmaceutics |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=773–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17140265 |pmc=2562334 |doi=10.1021/mp060066m |author2=Rogers CJ |author3=Beuscher AE |last4=Koob |first4=George F. |last5=Olson |first5=Arthur J. |last6=Dickerson |first6=Tobin J. |last7=Janda |first7=Kim D.}}</ref> Cannabinoids can also potentially prevent or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease by reducing [[tau protein]] phosphorylation, [[oxidative stress]], and neuroinflammation.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=VA |coauthors=Gowran, A |title=Alzheimer's disease; taking the edge off with cannabinoids? |journal=British Journal of Pharmacology |year=2007 |volume=152 |issue=5 |pages=655–62 |pmid=17828287 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2190031/ |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0707446 |pmc=2190031}}</ref>

A 2012 review from the ''Philosophical Transactions of a Royal Society B'' suggested that activating the cannabinoid system may trigger an "[[anti-oxidant]] cleanse" in the brain by removing damaged cells and improving the efficiency of the [[mitochrondria]].

=== Brain cancer ===

A study by [[Complutense University of Madrid]] found the chemicals in cannabis promote the death of [[brain cancer]] cells by essentially helping them feed upon themselves in a process called [[autophagy]]. The research team discovered that cannabinoids such as THC had anticancer effects in mice with human brain cancer cells and in people with brain tumors. When mice with the human brain cancer cells received the THC, the tumor shrank. Using [[electron microscopes]] to analyze brain tissue taken both before and after a 26-to 30-day THC treatment regimen, the researchers found that THC eliminated cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact.<ref name=pmid19425170>{{Cite journal|author=Salazar M |title=Cannabinoid action induces autophagy-mediated cell death through stimulation of ER stress in human glioma cells |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=1359–72 |year=2009|pmid=19425170 |pmc=2673842 |doi=10.1172/JCI37948 |laysummary=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/cancer/articles/2009/04/01/active-ingredient-in-marijuana-kills-brain-cancer |laysource=[[HealthDay]] |laydate=1 April 2009 |last12=Fimia |first12=GM |last13=Piacentini |first13=M |first14=F |first15=PP |first16=L |first17=JL |first18=M |first19=P |last20=Velasco |first20=G|author2=Carracedo A|author3=Salanueva IJ |last4=Cecconi |last5=Pandolfi |last6=González-Feria |last7=Iovanna |last8=Guzmán |last9=Boya |first4=Sonia |first5=Mar |first6=Ainara |first7=Patricia |first8=Cristina |first9=Sofía}}</ref> The patients did not have any toxic effects from the treatment; previous studies of THC for the treatment of cancer have also found the therapy to be well tolerated.<ref name=pmid19425170/>

The potential role of cannabis in treating symptoms of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] (or ''Lou Gehrig's Disease'') has been the subject of recent research. A survey was conducted on 131 people suffering from ALS. The survey asked if the subjects had used cannabis in the last 12 months to control some of their symptoms. Of the 131 subjects, 13 had used the drug in some form to control symptoms. The survey found that cannabis was moderately effective in reducing symptoms of appetite loss, depression, pain, spasticity, drooling and weakness, and the longest relief reported was for depression. The pattern of symptom relief was consistent with those reported by people with other conditions, including [[multiple sclerosis]] (Amtmann et al. 2004).<ref name="De-Vries 2010 2454–2462">{{cite journal |last=De-Vries |first=Kay |coauthors=Anita J Green |title=Cannabis use in palliative care – an examination of the evidence and the implications for nurses |journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing |date=17 |year=2010 |volume=19 |issue=17–18 |pages=2454–2462 |url=http://www.advancedholistichealth.org/PDF_Files/Palliative%20care.pdf |pmid=20920073 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03274.x}}</ref>

=== Pharmacologic THC and THC derivatives ===
In the USA, the FDA has approved several cannabinoids for use as medical therapies: [[dronabinol]] ([[Marinol#Marinol|Marinol]]) and [[nabilone]]. These medicines are taken orally.

These medications are usually used when first line treatments for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy fail to work. In extremely high doses and in rare cases "[[psychotomimetic]]" side effects are possible. The other commonly used antiemetic drugs are not associated with these side effects.

Marinol's manufacturer stated on their website: "The most frequently reported side effects in patients with AIDS during clinical studies involved the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). These CNS effects (euphoria, dizziness, or thinking abnormalities, for example) were reported by 33% of patients taking MARINOL".<ref>{{citation |url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.additional-resource.php?resourceID=000224 |title=Marijuana vs. Marinol – A side by side comparison |publisher=ProCon.org |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/05n0479/05N-0479-emc0004-04.pdf Marinol]. fda.gov (September 2004).</ref> Four documented fatalities resulting from Marinol have been reported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000145 |title=Deaths from Marijuana v. 17 FDA-Approved Drugs |publisher=ProCon.org |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref><ref>Stepper, H.

== Criticism ==
One of the major criticisms of cannabis as medicine is opposition to smoking as a method of consumption. However, smoking is no longer necessary due to the development of healthier methods. Medicinal cannabis patients can use [[Vaporizer (cannabis)|vaporizer]]s, where the essential cannabis compounds are extracted and inhaled. In addition, edible cannabis, which is produced in various baked goods, is also available, and has demonstrated longer lasting effects.

The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued an advisory<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108643.htm |title=Inter-agency advisory regarding claims that smoked marijuana is a medicine |publisher=fda.gov |year=2006 |accessdate=2012-12-24}}</ref> against ''smoked'' medical cannabis stating that, "marijuana has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision." The National Institute on Drug Abuse [[National Institute on Drug Abuse|NIDA]] state that "Marijuana itself is an unlikely medication candidate for several reasons: (1) it is an unpurified plant containing numerous chemicals with unknown health effects; (2) it is typically consumed by smoking further contributing to potential adverse effects; and (3) its cognitive impairing effects may limit its utility".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/tib/marijuana.html |title=Nida: Marijuana, An update from the National Institute on Drug Abuse |publisher=Nida.nih.gov |year=2011 |month=February |accessdate=2011-08-23}}</ref>

The [[Institute of Medicine]], run by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], conducted a comprehensive study in 1999 to assess the potential health benefits of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids. The study concluded that smoking cannabis is not recommended for the treatment of any disease condition, but did conclude that nausea, appetite loss, pain and anxiety can all be mitigated by marijuana. While the study expressed reservations about smoked cannabis due to the health risks associated with smoking, the study team concluded that until another mode of ingestion was perfected that could provide the same relief as smoked cannabis, there was no alternative. In addition, the study pointed out the inherent difficulty in marketing a non-patentable herb. Pharmaceutical companies will not substantially profit unless there is a patent. For those reasons, the Institute of Medicine concluded that there is little future in smoked cannabis as a medically approved medication. The report also concluded that for certain patients, such as the terminally ill or those with debilitating symptoms, the long-term risks are not of great concern.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Medical Marijuana Passes House Civil Justice Committee Without Dissent |publisher=Minnesotans for Compassionate Care |date=11 March 2009 |url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/in_the_trenches/2009/mar/11/press_release_medical_marijuana_ |accessdate=10 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |editor1-first=Janet E. |editor1-last=Joy |editor2-first=Stanley J. |editor2-last=Watson |editor3-first=John A. |editor3-last=Benson |year=1999 |title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309071550 |publisher=[[National Academies Press]] |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-07155-0 |oclc=246585475}}</ref>

=== Mental disorders ===

A study of 50,000 Swedish soldiers who had smoked at least once were twice as likely to develop [[schizophrenia]] as those who had not smoked. The study concluded that either smoking caused a higher rate of schizophrenia, or that those with schizophrenia were more likely to be drawn to cannabis.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Medical marijuana and the mind |journal=Harvard Mental Health Letter |year=2010 |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=1–3 |pmid=20499454 |author=Anon}}</ref>

A study by [[Keele University]] commissioned by the British government found that between 1996 and 2005 there had been significant reductions in the incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia. From 2000 onwards there were also significant reductions in the prevalence of psychoses. The authors say this data is "not consistent with the hypothesis that increasing cannabis use in earlier decades is associated with increasing schizophrenia or psychoses from the mid-1990s onwards".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcia.org/research/keele_study/Assessing-the-impact-of-cannabis.pdf |title=Assessing the impact of cannabis use on trends in diagnosed schizophrenia in the United Kingdom from 1996 to 2005 |author=Martin Frisher, et al. |journal=Schizophr.

A 10-year study on 1923 individuals from the general population in Germany, aged 14–24, concluded that cannabis use is a risk factor for the development of incident [[psychotic disorder]] symptoms, and the continued use might increase the risk.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Continued cannabis use and risk of incidence and persistence of psychotic symptoms: 10 year follow-up cohort study |year=2011 |last1=Kuepper |first1=R. |last2=Van Os |first2=J. |last3=Lieb |first3=R. |last4=Wittchen |first4=H.-U. |last5=Hofler |first5=M. |last6=Henquet |first6=C. |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=342 |pages=d738 |pmid=21363868 |pmc=3047001 |doi=10.1136/bmj.d738}}</ref>

However a medical study published in 2009 taken by the [[Medical Research Council]] in London, showed there was no significant effect of THC on [11C]-raclopride binding. Thus concluding, recreational cannabis users do not release significant amounts of dopamine from an oral THC dose equivalent to a standard cannabis cigarette. This result challenges current models of striatal dopamine release as the mechanism mediating cannabis as risk factor for schizophrenia.<ref>Can recreational doses of THC produce significant dopamine release in the human striatum? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19539765?ordinalpos=2&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.

=== Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ===

The evidence to date is conflicting as to whether smoking cannabis increases the risk of developing lung cancer or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) among people who do not smoke tobacco. In 2006 a study by Hashibe, Morgenstern, Cui, Tashkin, ''et al.'' suggested that smoking cannabis does not, by itself, increase the risk of lung cancer. Many studies did report a strongly synergistic effect, however, between tobacco use and smoking cannabis such that tobacco smokers who also smoked cannabis dramatically increased their already very high risk of developing lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by as much as 300%. Some of these research results follow below:

* In 2006, Hashibe, Morgenstern, Cui, Tashkin, ''et al.'' presented the results from a study involving 2,240 subjects that showed non-tobacco users who smoked marijuana did not exhibit an increased incidence of lung cancer or head-and-neck malignancies. These results were supported even among very long-term, very heavy users of marijuana.<ref name="tashink">

</ref> Tashkin, a pulmonologist who has studied cannabis for 30 years, commenting in news reports in the lay media on the results of the study he co-authored, suggested, "It's possible that tetrahydrocannabinol [[tetrahydrocannabinol|(THC)]] in cannabis smoke may encourage [[apoptosis]], or programmed cell death, causing cells to die off before they have a chance to undergo malignant transformation". He summarized the results found by his study, saying "We hypothesized that there would be a positive association between cannabis use and lung cancer, and that the association would be more positive with heavier use.

* A 2008 study by Hii, Tam, Thompson, and Naughton found that cannabis smoking leads to asymmetrical bullous disease, often in the setting of normal CXR and lung function. In subjects who smoke cannabis, these pathological changes occur at a younger age (approximately 20 years earlier) than in tobacco smokers. However this study involved only 10 patients who also smoked tobacco and had symptoms of the disease prior to the study. There was no control group in the study.<ref>

=== Ancient China and Taiwan ===
[[File:Da-ma.png|thumb|right|The use of cannabis, at least as fiber, has been shown to go back at least 10,000 years in [[Taiwan]]. "Dà má" ([[Pinyin]] pronunciation) is the Chinese expression for cannabis, the first character meaning "big" and the second character meaning "hemp."]]

Cannabis, called ''má'' [[wikt: 麻|麻]] (meaning "hemp; cannabis; numbness") or ''dàmá'' [[Wikt:大麻|大麻]] (with "big; great") in Chinese, was used in [[Taiwan]] for fiber starting about 10,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Ernest L. |last=Abel |year=1980 |chapter=Cannabis in the Ancient World |chapterurl=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/history/first12000/1.htm |title=Marihuana: the first twelve thousand years |publisher=Plenum Publishers |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-306-40496-2}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref>
The botanist Li Hui-Lin wrote that in China, "The use of Cannabis in medicine was probably a very early development. Since ancient humans used hemp seed as food, it was quite natural for them to also discover the medicinal properties of the plant."<ref>Li, Hui-Lin (1974). "An Archaeological and Historical Account of Cannabis in China", ''Economic Botany'' 28.4:437–448, p. 444.</ref> The oldest Chinese pharmacopeia, the (ca. 100 CE) ''[[Shennong Bencaojing]]'' 神農本草經 ("[[Shennong]]'s [[Materia Medica]] Classic"), describes ''dama'' "cannabis".
<blockquote>The flowers when they burst (when the pollen is scattered) are called 麻蕡 [''mafen''] or 麻勃 [''mabo'']. The best time for gathering is the seventh day of the seventh month. The seeds are gathered in the ninth month. The seeds which have entered the soil are injurious to man. It grows in [[Mount Tai|<nowiki>[Taishan]</nowiki>]] (in [[Shandong|<nowiki>[Shandong]</nowiki>]] ...). The flowers, the fruit (seed) and the leaves are [[officinal]]. The leaves and the fruit are said to be poisonous, but not the flowers and the kernels of the seeds.<ref>[[Emil Bretschneider|Bretschneider, Emil]] (1895).

Emperor Shen-Nung, who was also a pharmacologist, wrote a book on treatment methods in 2737 that included the medical benefits of cannabis.

"Such a strong drug, however, suggests that the Chinese pharmacists had now obtained from far to the southwest not THC-bearing ''Cannabis sativa'' but ''Cannabis indica'', so strong it knocks you out cold.<ref>Barber, Elizabeth Wayland.

Cannabis is one of the [[50 Fundamental Herbs|50 "fundamental" herbs]] in [[traditional Chinese medicine]],<ref name="Wong"/> and is prescribed to treat diverse indications.
<blockquote>Every part of the hemp plant is used in medicine; the dried flowers (勃), the [[Achene|achenia]] (蕡), the seeds (麻仁), the oil (麻油), the leaves, the stalk, the root, and the juice. The flowers are recommended in the 120 different forms of (風 ''feng'') disease, in menstrual disorders, and in wounds. The achenia, which are considered to be poisonous, stimulate the nervous system, and if used in excess, will produce hallucinations and staggering gait. They are prescribed in nervous disorders, especially those marked by local anaesthesia. The seeds, by which is meant the white kernels of the achenia, are used for a great variety of affections, and are considered to be tonic, [[demulcent]], alterative, [[laxative]], [[emmenagogue]], [[diuretic]], [[anthelmintic]], and corrective. They are made into a [[congee]] by boiling with water, mixed with wine by a particular process, made into pills, and beaten into a paste. A very common mode of exhibition, however, is by simply eating the kernels. It is said that their continued use renders the flesh firm and prevents old age. They are prescribed internally in fluxes, post-partum difficulties, [[aconitine|aconite]] poisoning, [[vermilion|vermillion]] poisoning, constipation, and obstinate vomiting. Externally they are used for eruptions, [[ulcer]]s, [[favus]], wounds, and falling of the hair. The oil is used for falling hair, sulfur poisoning, and dryness of the throat. The leaves are considered to be poisonous, and the freshly expressed juice is used as an [[anthelmintic]], in scorpion stings, to stop the hair from falling out and to prevent it from turning gray. They are especially thought to have antiperiodic properties (prevention of regular recurrence of the symptoms of a disease). The stalk, or its bark, is considered to be diuretic, and is used with other drugs in gravel. The juice of the root is used for similar purposes, and is also thought to have a beneficial action in retained placenta and post-partum hemorrhage. An infusion of hemp (for the preparation of which no directions are given) is used as a demulcent drink for quenching thirst and relieving fluxes.<ref>Smith, Frederick Porter (1911).

An Irish physician, [[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy]], is credited with introducing the therapeutic use of cannabis to Western medicine. He was Assistant-Surgeon and Professor of Chemistry at the Medical College of [[Calcutta]], and conducted a cannabis experiment in the 1830s, first testing his preparations on animals, then administering them to patients to help treat muscle spasms, stomach cramps or general pain.<ref name=Mack>{{Cite book

Later in the century, researchers investigating methods of detecting cannabis intoxication discovered that smoking the drug reduced [[intraocular pressure]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zauberpilz.com/golden/g31-40.htm |title=Golden Guide |publisher=zauberpilz.com}}</ref> In 1955 the antibacterial effects were described at the [[Palacký University of Olomouc]].

In 1964, Dr. Albert Lockhart and Manley West began studying the health effects of traditional cannabis use in [[Jamaican]] communities. They discovered that [[Rastafarian]]s had unusually low glaucoma rates and local fishermen were washing their eyes with cannibis extract in the belief that it would improve their sight. Lockhart and West developed, and in 1987 gained permission to market, the pharmaceutical [[Canasol]]: one of the first to cannabis extracts. They continued to work with cannabis throughout the years, developing more pharmaceuticals and eventually receiving the [[Jamaican Order of Merit]] for their work.<ref name="FFY"/>

Later, in the 1970s, a [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] version of [[THC]] was produced and approved for use in the United States as the drug [[Marinol#Marinol|Marinol]]. It was delivered as a capsule, to be swallowed. Patients complained that the violent nausea associated with chemotherapy made swallowing capsules difficult. Further, along with ingested cannabis, capsules are harder to [[titration|dose-titrate]] accurately than smoked cannabis because their onset of action is so much slower. Smoking has remained the route of choice for many patients because its onset of action provides almost immediate relief from symptoms and because that fast onset greatly simplifies titration. For these reasons, and because of the difficulties arising from the way cannabinoids are metabolized after being ingested, oral dosing is probably the least satisfactory route for cannabis administration.<ref name="Lancet2003">{{Cite journal|last=Baker |first=D. |coauthors= Pryce, G., Giovannoni, G., Thompson, A.J. |year=2003 |title=The therapeutic potential of cannabis |journal=Lancet Neurology |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=291–98 |url=http://www.ukcia.org/research/TherapeuticPotentialOfCannabis.pdf |accessdate=15 August 2009 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(03)00381-8 |pmid=12849183}}</ref> Relatedly, some studies have indicated that at least some of the beneficial effects that cannabis can provide may derive from [[synergy]] among the multiplicity of cannabinoids and other chemicals present in the dried plant material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabis-med.org/data/pdf/2001-03-04-7.pdf |title=Cannabis and Cannabis Extracts: Greater Than the Sum of Their Parts? |author=McPartland, John M.; Russo, Ethan B. |work=Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics |publisher=International Association for Cannabis as Medicine}}</ref> Such synergy is, by definition, impossible with respect to the use of single-cannabinoid drugs like Marinol.

== National and international regulations ==
{{Main|Legal and medical status of cannabis}}
[[File:Legality of cannabis for medical purposes.png|right|thumb|Worldwide laws on [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] possession for medical purposes.]]

Medical use of cannabis or preparation containing THC as the active substance is legalized in Canada, Belgium, Austria, Netherlands, UK, Spain, Israel, Finland and some states in the U.S., although it is still illegal under U.S. federal law.

Cannabis is in Schedule IV of the United Nations´ [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], making it subject to special restrictions. Article 2 provides for the following, in reference to Schedule IV drugs:<ref name="Single Convention">{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/single-convention.html|title=Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 As amended by the 1972 Protocol|date=13 March 1961|work=[[International Narcotics Control Board]]|publisher=United Nations|pages=2–3|accessdate=17 August 2009|format=PDF}}</ref>

{{quote|''A Party shall, if in its opinion the prevailing conditions in its country render it the most appropriate means of protecting the public health and welfare, prohibit the production, manufacture, export and import of, trade in, possession or use of any such drug except for amounts which may be necessary for medical and scientific research only, including clinical trials therewith to be conducted under or subject to the direct supervision and control of the Party.''}}

The convention thus allows countries to outlaw cannabis for all non-research purposes but lets nations choose to allow medical and scientific purposes if they believe total prohibition is not the most appropriate means of protecting health and welfare. The convention requires that states that permit the production or use of medical cannabis must operate a licensing system for all cultivators, manufacturers and distributors and ensure that the total cannabis market of the state shall not exceed that required "for medical and scientific purposes."<ref name="Single Convention"/>

=== Africa ===

Cannabis has been used in Africa since at least the 15th century. Its use was introduced by Arab traders, somehow connected to India. “In Africa, the plant was used for snake bite, to facilitate childbirth, [[malaria]], fever, blood poisoning, [[anthrax]], asthma, and [[dysentery]].” (Zuardi, 2006, 4) Though African governments have tried to limit and stop its use, it still seems to be deeply ingrained, mostly through religious rituals.

BC College of Physicians and Surgeons’ recommendation, as well as the CMPA position, is that physicians may prescribe cannabis if they feel comfortable with it.

It is also legal for patients approved by Health Canada to grow their own cannabis for personal consumption, and it's possible to obtain a production license as a person designated by a patient. Designated producers were permitted to grow a cannabis supply for only a single patient, however. That regulation and related restrictions on supply were found unconstitutional by the Federal Court of Canada in January 2008. The court found that these regulations did not allow a sufficient legal supply of medical cannabis, and thus forced many patients to purchase their medicine from unauthorized, black market sources. This was the eighth time in the previous ten years that the courts ruled against Health Canada's regulations restricting the supply of the medicine.<ref name=NationalPost_01>{{Cite news| title=Court challenge aims to legalize all cannabis use; Advocates say previous rule a 'mockery'.| first=Shannon|last=Kari|newspaper=[[National Post]]|location=Toronto|id=ProQuest Newsstand, Document ID: 1739130721|date=1 June 2009|page=A.6}}</ref>

There are eight government-sanctioned cannabis growing operations in Israel, which distribute it for medical purposes to patients who have a prescription from a doctor, via either a company's store, or in a medical center.<ref name=Bohn/>

THC, the psychoactive chemical component in marijuana that causes a high, was first isolated by Israeli scientists [[Raphael Mechoulam]] of the [[Hebrew University in Jerusalem]]’s Center for Research on Pain and [[Yechiel Gaoni]] of the [[Weizmann Institute]] in 1964.<ref name=Bohn/><ref name=Kloosterman/>

The Tikkin Olam company has developed a variety of marijuana that is reported to provide the medical benefits of cannabis, but without THC. The cannabis instead contains high quantities of CBD, a substance that is believed to be an anti-inflammatory ingredient, which helps alleviate pain.<ref name=Bohn/><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110102025045/http://www.israelvalley.com/news/2010/11/22/29283/israelvalley-sante-les-vertus-du-cannabis-en-israel-le-fournisseur-medical-de-marijuana-du-ministere-de-la-sante-tikun-ol News: ISRAELVALLEY SANTE – Les vertus du cannabis – En Israël, le « fournisseur médical » de marijuana du Ministère de la santé, Tikun Olam, prône les bienfaits de la plante controversée pour le traitement du cancer].

Since 2003, the country's pharmacies distribute medicinal cannabis (pharmaceutical form of the natural plant) by prescription, in addition to other drugs containing cannabinoids (dronabinol, Sativex).

The four therapeutic qualities produced by the company Bedrocan and distributed in the pharmacy are:

*Bedrocan (18% dronabinol / THC. + <1% Cannabidiol / CBD)
*Bedica   (14% dronabinol / THC. + <1% Cannabidiol / CBD) granules
*Bediol (11% dronabinol / THC. + <1% Cannabidiol / CBD)
*Bedrobinol (6%  dronabinol / THC. + 7.5% Cannabidiol / CBD) granules

=== Spain ===
In Spain, since the late 1990s and early 2000s, medical cannabis underwent a process of progressive decriminalization and legalisation. The parliament of the region of [[Catalonia]] was the first in Spain to have voted unanimously in 2001 legalizing medical marijuana; it was quickly followed by parliaments of [[Aragon]] and the [[Balearic Islands]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Spanish Penal Code prohibits the sale of cannabis but it does not prohibit consumption (although consumption on the street is fined). Until early 2000, the Penal Code did not distinguish between therapeutic use of cannabis and recreational use, however, several court decisions show that this distinction is increasingly taken into account by judges. From 2006, the sale of seed is legalized,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} the sale and public consumption remains illegal, and private cultivation and use are permitted to associations.<ref>Hidalgo, Susana (01-03-2009).

Several studies have been conducted to study the effects of cannabis on patients suffering from diseases like cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, seizures or asthma. This research was conducted by various Spanish agencies at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid headed by Manuel Guzman, the hospital of La Laguna in Tenerife led neurosurgeon Luis González Feria or the [[University of Barcelona]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Several cannabis consumption clubs and user associations have been established throughout Spain. These clubs, the first of which was created in 1991, are non-profit associations who grow cannabis and sell it at cost to its members. The legal status of these clubs is uncertain: in 1997, four members of the first club, the Barcelona Ramón Santos Association of Cannabis Studies, were sentenced to 4 months in prison and a 3000 euro fine, while at about the same time, the court of Bilbao ruled that another club was not in violation of the law. The Andalusian regional government also commissioned a study by criminal law professors on the "Therapeutic use of cannabis and the creation of establishments of acquisition and consumption. The study concluded that such clubs are legal as long as they distribute only to a restricted list of legal adults, provide only the amount of drugs necessary for immediate consumption, and not earn a profit. The Andalusian government never formally accepted these guidelines and the legal situation of the clubs remains insecure. In 2006 and 2007, members of these clubs were acquitted in trial for possession and sale of cannabis and the police were ordered to return seized crops.<ref name=Perez/>

=== United Kingdom ===

In England and [[Wales]], the use of cannabis medicinally is accepted as a mitigating factor under Sentencing Council guidelines, if it is being cultivated or found in possession of someone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drug Offences Definitive Guideline|url=http://sentencingcouncil.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/Drug_Offences_Definitive_Guideline_final_(web).pdf|publisher=Sentencing Council}}</ref> However, in the United Kingdom, possession of small quantities of cannabis does not usually warrant an arrest or court appearance (street cautions or fines are often given out instead). Under UK law, certain cannabinoids are permitted medically,<ref name="parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk">{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Lords |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199798/ldselect/ldsctech/151/15106.htm |title=House of Lords – Science and Technology – Ninth Report |publisher=Parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> but these are strictly controlled with many provisos under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] (in the 1985 amendments).

The [[British Medical Association]]'s official stance is "users of cannabis for medical purposes should be aware of the risks, should enrol for clinical trials, and should talk to their doctors about new alternative treatments; but we do not advise them to stop."<ref name="parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk"/>

On 19 October 2009 the US Deputy Attorney General issued a US Department of Justice memorandum to "All United States Attorneys" providing clarification and guidance to federal prosecutors in US States that have enacted laws authorizing the medical use of marijuana. The document is intended solely as "a guide to the exercise of investigative and prosecutorial discretion and as guidance on resource allocation and federal priorities." The US Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden provided seven criteria, the application of which acts as a guideline to prosecutors and federal agents to ascertain whether a patient's use, or their caregiver's provision, of medical cannabis "represents part of a recommended treatment regiment consistent with applicable state law", and recommends against prosecuting patients using medical cannabis products according to state laws. Not applying those criteria, the Dep. Attorney General Ogden concludes, would likely be "an inefficient use of limited federal resources". The memorandum does not change any laws. Sale of cannabis remains illegal under federal law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/medical-marijuana.pdf |title=19 October 2009; Office of the Deputy Attorney General, US Dept. of Justice, Washington D.C. 20530.
