'''Adolescent medicine''' is a medical subspecialty that focuses on care of patients who are in the [[adolescent]] period of development, generally ranging from the last years of elementary school until graduation from high school (some doctors in this subspecialty treat young adults attending college at area clinics, in the subfield of [[college health]]).  Patients have generally entered [[puberty]], which typically begins between the ages of 9 to 11 for girls, and 11 to 14 for boys.  A [[primary care]] subspecialty, adolescent medicine incorporates aspects of [[gynecology]], [[endocrinology]], [[sports medicine]], [[nutrition]], [[dermatology]] and [[psychology]]. Adolescent medicine is an important specialty of [[Family Practice]], [[Internal Medicine]], [[Pediatrics]] and [[Youth Health]].

Issues with a high prevalence during adolescence are frequently addressed by providers. These include:

*[[Sexually transmitted disease]] (working with specialists in [[pediatric endocrinology]], adolescent [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]], [[immunology]] [[infectious diseases]], and [[urology]] and [[reproductive medicine]])
*[[Unintended pregnancy]] (working with specialists in adolescent obstetrics and gynecology, especially in [[neonatology]] and [[maternal-fetal medicine]]; many- though not all- are medically risky or high-risk cases and/or to those with psychosocial, environmental, and socioeconomic challenges)
*[[Birth control]] (there is currently a drive in the United States federal government's health care policymaking to ensure access to any and all prescription or non-prescription contraceptive methods to adolescent minors who request them, especially if they are over a certain age) 
*[[Substance abuse]]
*Menstrual disorders (such as [[amenorrhea]], [[dysmenorrhea]] and [[dysfunctional uterine bleeding]])
*Acne (working with specialists in [[dermatology]] who treat adolescents)
*[[Eating disorders]] like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (working with [[nutritionists]] and [[dieticians]], and also specialists in pediatric mental health counseling, [[clinical psychology]], and [[pediatric psychiatry]], who work with adolescents) 
*Certain mental illnesses (especially personality disorders, anxiety disorders, major depression and suicide, bipolar disorder, and certain types of schizophrenia; in concert with mental health counselors, clinical psychologists, and pediatric psychiatrists specializing in adolescent health care)
*Delayed or precocious puberty (often working with specialists in adolescent [[pediatric endocrinology]], [[urology]], and [[andrology]])

==Scope of care==
Providers of care for adolescents generally take a holistic approach to the patient, and attempt to obtain information pertinent to the patient's well-being in a variety of different domains.  This approach, similar to the [[biopsychosocial model]], is encapsulated in the '''HEADSS assessment''',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carr-Gregg MR, Enderby KC, Grover SR |title=Risk-taking behaviour of young women in Australia: screening for health-risk behaviours |journal=The Medical journal of Australia |volume=178 |issue=12 |pages=601â€“4 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12797844 |doi= |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_12_160603/car10800_fm.html}}</ref><ref name=goldring>Goldenring, JM and Rosen DS (2004) Getting into adolescent heads: An essential update. Contemporary Pediatrics, Vol 21, No. 1, pp. 64-90.</ref> which is a screening acronym for adolescent patients. This has been expanded to '''HEEADSSS''' to include additional question sets (indicated with a *).  It includes:
*'''Home''' -- how is the adolescent's home life?  How are his/her relationships with family members?  Where and with whom does the patient live?  Is his/her living situation stable?
*'''Education''' (or '''Employment''') -- how is the adolescent's school performance?  Is he/she well-behaved, or are there discipline problems at school?  If he/she is working, is he/she making a living wage?  Are they financially secure?
*'''Eating*''' (incorporates body image) -- does the patient have a balanced diet?  Is there adequate calcium intake?  Is the adolescent trying to lose weight, and (if so), is it in a healthy manner?  How does he/she feel about his/her body?  Has there been significant weight gain/loss recently?
*'''Activities''' -- how does the patient spend his/her time?  Are they engaging in dangerous or risky behavior?  Are they supervised during their free time?  With whom do they spend most of their time?  Do they have a supportive peer group?
*'''Drugs''' (including alcohol and tobacco) -- does the patient drink caffeinated beverages (including energy drinks)?  Does the patient smoke?  Does the patient drink alcohol?  Has the patient used illegal drugs?  If there is any substance use, to what degree, and for how long?
*'''Sex''' -- is the patient sexually active?  If so, what form of contraception (if any) is used? How many partners has the patient had?  Has the patient ever been pregnant/fathered a child?  Do the patient and their partners get routine reproductive health and STD checks and physical examinations?  Are there any symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection?  Does the patient identify as heterosexual, homosexual, or unsure?  Does the patient feel safe discussing sexuality issues with parents or other caregivers? 
*'''Suicidality''' (including general mood assessment) -- what is the patient's mood from day to day?  Has he/she thought about/attempted suicide? In broader terms, is their mental and emotional state so dysfunctional that the activities of daily living are largely impaired or they present a risk to themselves or others?
*'''Safety*''' -- does the patient regularly wear a bicycle helmet? seatbelt? Does the patient drive while intoxicated or with a driver who is intoxicated? Does the patient wear safety equipment while participating in sports?
* Some providers favor the addition of '''Strengths''' to the list, in an effort to avoid focusing on issues of risk or concern, and reframe the patient interaction in a manner that highlights resilience.

In addition to a detailed history, adolescents should have a comprehensive physical exam (including a developmental and neurological assessment, STI testing, and a reproductive system exam) and mental health status exam on at least a yearly basis, in addition to yearly dental and ocular exams.  Developmental progression, including an assessment of [[Tanner stage]], should be noted at every yearly visit, and appropriate endocrinological work-ups undertaken for patients that fail to develop in an anticipated manner. Young women and young men should be taught how to examine their [[breast]] tissue for signs of [[breast cancer]], and young men should be taught how to examine their testicles and penis for cancer and STDs.  Screening lab tests, including a [[complete blood count]] to screen for anemia, and either a spot [[cholesterol]] check or (ideally) a [[fasting lipid profile]] to screen for [[wiktionary:hyperlipidemia|hyperlipidemia]], should be obtained at least once during adolescence.  For patients who are sexually active, particularly in areas of high prevalence or with patients participating in higher-risk behaviors, screening tests for [[sexually transmitted diseases]] should be performed, including an [[Rapid Plasma Reagin|RPR]] or [[VDRL]] for [[syphilis]], screening for [[gonorrhea]] and [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], and [[HIV]].  Sexually active females should have a [[pelvic examination]] and a [[physical examination]] if indicated by the presence of symptoms concerning for an STI; males should have a urological examination and a physical examination. Needed immunizations include: a [[tetanus vaccination]] or [[booster shot]], a [[meningitis vaccination]], the [[Gardasil vaccine]] against HPV ([[Human Papillomavirus]], a leading cause of [[cervical cancer]] and [[genital warts]]) and a yearly [[influenza vaccination]].

==Young peoples' access to health care==
In addition, issues of [[medical ethics]], particularly related to [[confidentiality]] and the right to [[consent]] for medical care, are pertinent to the practice of adolescent medicine.<ref>Chown P, Kang M, Sanci L, Newnham V and Bennett D (2008) Adolescent Health: GP Resource Kit.

==Training==
Adolescent medicine providers are generally drawn from the specialties of [[pediatrics]], [[internal medicine]], [[med/peds]] or [[family medicine]].  The '''certifying boards''' for these different specialties have varying requirements for certification, though all require successful completion of a [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] (a comprehensive list of which is available through the '''[http://www.adolescenthealth.org/ Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine]''') and a passing score on a certifying exam.  The American Board of Pediatrics and the American Board of Internal Medicine require evidence of scholarly achievement by candidates for subspecialty certification, usually in the form of an original research study.

In the United States, subspecialty medical board certification in adolescent medicine is available through the specialty boards of [[American Board of Internal Medicine]], the [[American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry]], the [[American Board of Family Medicine]], the [[American Osteopathic Board of Family Physicians]], the [[American Board of Pediatrics]], and the [[American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Specialties & Subspecialties|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/specialty-subspecialty-certification.aspx|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate= 25 September 2012}}</ref>
