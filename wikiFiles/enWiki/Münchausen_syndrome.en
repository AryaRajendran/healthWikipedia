'''Münchausen syndrome''' is a [[psychiatric disorder|psychiatric]] [[factitious disorder]] wherein those affected feign [[disease]], illness, or [[psychological trauma]] to draw [[attention]], [[sympathy]], or reassurance to themselves. It is also sometimes known as '''hospital addiction syndrome''', '''thick chart syndrome''', or '''hospital hopper syndrome'''. True Münchausen syndrome fits within the subclass of factitious disorder with predominantly physical signs and symptoms, but in addition they also have a history of recurrent [[Inpatient care|hospitalization]], travelling, and dramatic, untrue, and extremely improbable tales of their past experiences.<ref>{{cite book | title=Essentials of psychiatry | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. | author=Jerald Kay and Allan Tasman | year=2006 | pages=680 | isbn=0-470-01854-2}}</ref>
Nurses and doctors sometimes refer to them as '''frequent flyers''', because they return to the hospital just as frequent flyers return to the airport. However, there is discussion to reclassify them as [[somatoform disorder]] in the [[DSM-5]] as it is unclear whether or not people are conscious of drawing attention to themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Krahn LE, Bostwick JM, Stonnington CM |title=Looking toward DSM-V: should factitious disorder become a subtype of somatoform disorder? |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=277–82 |year=2008 |pmid=18621932 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.49.4.277 |url=}}</ref>

Münchausen syndrome is related to [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy]] (MSbP/MSP), which refers to the [[physical abuse|abuse]] of another person, typically a child, in order to seek attention or sympathy for the abuser. It is an obsessive want to create symptoms for the victim in order to obtain repeated medication or even operations.

==Description==
In Münchausen syndrome, the affected person [[exaggerates]] or creates [[symptom]]s of [[illness]]es in themselves to gain investigation, treatment, attention, sympathy, and comfort from medical personnel. In some extreme cases, people suffering from Münchausen's syndrome are highly knowledgeable about the practice of medicine and are able to produce symptoms that result in lengthy and costly medical analysis, prolonged [[hospital]] stay and unnecessary [[surgery|operations]]. The role of "patient" is a familiar and comforting one, and it fills a psychological need in people with Münchausen's. This disorder is distinct from [[hypochondriasis]] and other [[somatoform disorders]] in that those with the latter do not intentionally produce their somatic symptoms.<ref>{{cite book | title=Kaplan & Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry (2 Volume Set) | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers | author=Benjamin J. Sadock (Editor), Virginia A. Sadock (Editor) | year=7th edition (January 15, 2000) | pages=3172 | isbn=0683301284}}</ref>
 
Risk factors for developing Münchausen syndrome include childhood traumas, growing up with parents/caretakers who were emotionally unavailable due to illness or emotional problems, a serious illness as a child, failed aspirations to work in the medical field, [[personality disorder]]s, and a low self-esteem. Münchausen syndrome is more common in men and seen in young or middle-aged adults. Those with a history of working in healthcare are also at greater risk of developing it.<ref>Staff, Mayo Clinic. "Munchausen Syndrome." Mayo Clinic. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 13 May 2011. Web. 11 Apr. 2013.</ref>

Arrhythmogenic Münchausen syndrome describes individuals who simulate or stimulate cardiac arrhythmias to gain medical attention.<ref name="Vaglio JC, Schoenhard JA, Saavedra PJ, Williams SR, Raj SR 2010">{{Cite journal|author=Vaglio JC, Schoenhard JA, Saavedra PJ, Williams SR, Raj SR |title=Arrhythmogenic Munchausen syndrome culminating in caffeine-induced ventricular tachycardia |journal=J Electrocardiol |year=2010 |pmid=20888004 |url=|volume=44|issue=2|pages=229–31|doi=10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2010.08.006}}</ref> The syndrome differs from [[malingering]], in which a patient fabricates symptoms for an apparent purpose, such as financial compensation, absence from work, or access to drugs.

A similar behavior called [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy]] has been documented in the parent or guardian of a child. The adult ensures that his or her child will experience some medical affliction, therefore compelling the child to suffer treatment for a significant portion of their youth in hospitals. Furthermore, a disease may actually be initiated in the child by the parent or guardian. This condition is considered distinct from Münchausen syndrome. In fact, there is growing consensus in the [[pediatric]] community that this disorder should be renamed "medical abuse" to highlight the real harm caused by the deception and to make it less likely that a perpetrator can use a psychiatric defense when real harm is done.<ref>''Pediatrics'' 2007 May 05;119:1026-1030</ref> Parents who perpetrate this abuse are often affected by concomitant psychiatric problems like [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[spouse abuse]], [[psychopathy]], or [[psychosis]]. In rare cases, multiple children in one family may be affected either directly as victims or as witnesses who are threatened to keep them silent.

==Origin of the name==
The syndrome name derives from [[Baron Münchhausen]] (Karl Friedrich Hieronymus Freiherr von Münchhausen, 1720–1797), a German nobleman, who purportedly told many fantastic and impossible stories about himself, which [[Rudolf Raspe]] later published as ''The Surprising Adventures of Baron Münchhausen''.

In 1951, [[Richard Asher]] was the first to describe a pattern of [[self-harm]], wherein individuals fabricated histories, signs, and symptoms of illness. Remembering Baron Münchhausen, Asher named this condition Münchausen's Syndrome in his article in [[The Lancet]] in February 1951,<ref>Lancet 1951 Feb 10;1(6650):339-41 {{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(51)92313-6}}</ref> quoted in his obituary in the [[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]:

{{quote|"Here is described a common syndrome which most doctors have seen, but about which little has been written. Like the famous Baron von Munchausen, the persons affected have always travelled widely; and their stories, like those attributed to him, are both dramatic and untruthful. Accordingly the syndrome is respectfully dedicated to the Baron, and named after him."|[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]|''R.A.J. Asher, M.D., F.R.C.P.''<ref name="BMJObituary">{{Cite journal

Originally, this term was used for all [[factitious disorders]]. Now, however, there is considered to be a wide range of factitious disorders, and the diagnosis of "Münchausen syndrome" is reserved for the most severe form, where the simulation of disease is the central activity of the affected person's life.

==Treatment and prognosis==
Medical professionals or doctors suspecting Münchausen's in a patient should first rule out the possibility that the patient has an early stage disease that is not yet clinically detectable. Providers need to acknowledge that there is uncertainty in treating suspected Münchausen patients so that real diseases are not under-treated.<ref>Bursztajn, H, Feinbloom RI, Hamm RM, Brodsky A. Medical Choices, medical chances: How patients, families and physicians can cope with uncertainty. New York. Delacourte/Lawrence. 1981.</ref> Then they should take a careful patient history and seek medical records, to look for early deprivation, [[childhood abuse]], or [[mental illness]]. If a patient is at risk to himself or herself, inpatient [[psychiatric hospital]]ization should be initiated.<ref>Johnson BR, Harrison JA. Suspected Münchausen syndrome and civil commitment. J Am Acad Psychiatry Law. 2000; 28:74-76.</ref>

Medical providers or doctors should consider working with mental health specialists to help treat the underlying mood or disorder as well as to avoid [[countertransference]].<ref>Elder W, Coletsos IC, Bursztajn HJ. Factitious Disorder/Munchhausen Syndrome. The 5-Minute Clinical Consult. 18th Edition. 2010. Editor. Domino, F.J. Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott. Philadelphia.</ref> Therapeutic and medical treatment should center on the underlying psychiatric disorder: a [[mood disorder]], an [[anxiety disorder]], or [[borderline personality disorder]]. The patient's [[prognosis]] depends upon the category under which the underlying disorder falls; depression and anxiety, for example, generally respond well to [[medication]] and/or [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], whereas [[borderline personality disorder]], like all [[personality disorder]]s, is presumed to be pervasive and more stable over time,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Davidson, G. et al. |title=Abnormal Psychology - 3rd Canadian Edition |publisher= John Wiley & Sons Canada, Ltd. |location=Mississauga |year=2008 |pages=412 |isbn=978-0-470-84072-6 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> thus offers the worst or best prognosis.

Patients may have multiple [[scar]]s on [[abdomen]] due to repeated "emergency" [[surgery|operations]].<ref>AJ Giannini,HR Black. Psychiatric, Psychogenic and Somatopsychic Disorders Handbook. New Hyde Park ,NY.  Medical Examination Publishing, 1978,pp.194-195. ISBN 0-87488-596-5</ref>

There are several symptoms that together point to Münchausen syndrome. Some are frequent hospitalizations, knowledge of several illnesses, frequently requesting medication such as pain killers, openness to extensive surgery, little to no visitors during hospitalizations, exaggerated or fabricated stories about several medical problems, and more. Münchausen syndrome should not be confused with [[hypochondria]] as patients do not believe they are sick, they want to be sick. It is also not the same as pretending to be sick for personal benefit such as being excused from work or school. <ref>Staff, Mayo Clinic. "Munchausen Syndrome." Mayo Clinic. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 13 May 2011. Web. 11 Apr. 2013.</ref> 

There are several ways in which the patients fake their symptoms. Other than making up past medical histories and faking illnesses patients might inflict harm on themselves such as taking laxatives or blood thinners, ingesting or injecting themselves with bacteria, cutting or burning themselves, and disrupting their healing process such as reopening wounds. 
Many of these conditions do not have clearly observable or diagnostic symptoms and sometimes the syndrome will go undetected because patients will fabricate identities when visiting the hospital several times. Münchausen syndrome has several complications as these patients will go to great lengths to fake their illness. Severe health problems, serious injuries, loss of limbs or organs, and even death are possible complications. <ref>Staff, Mayo Clinic. "Munchausen Syndrome." Mayo Clinic. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 13 May 2011. Web. 11 Apr. 2013.</ref>
