'''Heinrich Fritsch''' (December 5, 1844 &ndash; May 12, 1915) was a German [[gynecologist]] and [[obstetrician]] who was a native of [[Halle an der Saale]].

He studied medicine at the Universities of [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and [[University of Halle|Halle]], where in 1869 he earned his medical doctorate. Afterwards he remained at Halle as an assistant at the clinic of [[obstetrics]] under [[Robert Michaelis von Olshausen]] (1835-1915). In 1877 he became an associate professor, and in 1882 was a professor and director of the obstetrical clinic at [[University of Breslau|Breslau]]. From 1893 to 1910 he was a professor at the [[University of Bonn]].

Fritsch was a highly regarded surgeon and teacher, who is credited for training an entire generation of acclaimed gynecologists, that included physicians such as [[Hermann Johannes Pfannenstiel]] (1862-1909). In 1894 he provided an early description of "[[Asherman's syndrome]]", and his name is associated with "Fritsch's manipulation", an obstetric compression technique used for controlling bleeding. 

In 1877, with [[Hermann Fehling (physician)|Hermann Fehling]] (1847-1925), he founded the gynecological journal ''Zentralblatt für Gynäkologie''.
