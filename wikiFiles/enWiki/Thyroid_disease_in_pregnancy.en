[[Thyroid#Disorders|Thyroid disorders]] are prevalent in women of child-bearing age and for this reason commonly present in [[pregnancy]] and the [[puerperium]].<ref>Okosieme OE, Lazarus JH. "Management of thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy". Expert opin  ''Pharmacother''. 2008; 9: 2281-2293.</ref> Uncorrected thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy has adverse effects on [[fetus|fetal]] and maternal well-being. The deleterious effects of thyroid dysfunction can also extend beyond pregnancy and delivery to affect neurointellectual development in the early life of the child. Demand for thyroid hormones is increased during pregnancy which may cause a previously unnoticed thyroid disorder to worsen. Still, the overall lack of evidence precludes a recommendation for universal screening for thyroid disorder in all pregnant women.<ref name=Vissenberg2012/>

==The Thyroid in Pregnancy==

Fetal [[thyroxine]] is wholly obtained from maternal sources in early pregnancy since the fetal [[thyroid]] gland only becomes functional in the second trimester of [[gestation]]. As thyroxine is essential for fetal [[neurodevelopment]] it is critical that maternal delivery of thyroxine to the fetus is ensured early in gestation. In pregnancy, [[iodide]] losses through the urine and the feto-placental unit contribute to a state of relative [[iodine deficiency]].<ref>Smyth PP, Hetherton AM, Smith DF et al. "Maternal iodine status and thyroid volume during pregnancy: correlation with neonatal iodine intake". ''J Clin Endocrinol Metab.'' 1997; 82: 2840-3.</ref> Thus, pregnant women require additional iodine intake. A daily iodine intake of 250 mcg is recommended in pregnancy but this is not always achieved even in iodine sufficient parts of the world.<ref>Andersson M, de Benoist B, Delange F, Zupan ''J.Public Health Nutr.'' 2007 Dec;10(12A):1606-11 "Prevention and control of iodine deficiency in pregnant and lactating women and in children less than 2-years-old: conclusions and recommendations of the Technical Consultation".</ref>

[[Thyroid hormone]] concentrations in blood are increased in pregnancy, partly due to the high levels of [[oestrogen]] and due to the weak thyroid stimulating effects of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) that acts like [[thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]]. Thyroxine (T4) levels rise from about 6–12 weeks, and peak by mid-gestation; reverse changes are seen with TSH. Gestation specific reference ranges for [[thyroid function tests]] are not widely in use although many centres are now preparing them.

==Hypothyroidism==

===Clinical evaluation===
[[Hypothyroidism]] is common in pregnancy with an estimated prevalence of 2-3% and 0.3-0.5% for [[subclinical]] and overt hypothyroidism respectively.<ref>Klein RZ, Haddow JE, Faix JD et al. "Prevalence of thyroid deficiency in pregnant women". ''Clin Endocrinol'' (Oxf). 1991; 35:  41-6.</ref> Endemic iodine deficiency accounts for most hypothyroidism in pregnant women worldwide while chronic autoimmune [[thyroiditis]] is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine sufficient parts of the world.<ref>Mandel SJ. "Hypothyroidism and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis in the pregnant state: maternal aspects." ''Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab.'' 2004 ; 18: 213-24.</ref> The presentation of hypothyroidism in pregnancy is not always classical and may sometimes be difficult to distinguish from the symptoms of normal pregnancy. A high index of suspicion is therefore required especially in women at risk of thyroid disease e.g. women with a personal or family history of [[thyroid disease]], [[goitre]], or co-existing primary autoimmune disorder like [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]].

===Risks of Hypothyroidism on fetal and maternal well-being===
Hypothyroidism is diagnosed by noting a high TSH associated with a subnormal T4 concentration. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is present when the TSH is high but the T4 level is in the normal range but usually low normal. SCH is the commonest form of hypothyroidism in pregnancy and is usually due to progressive thyroid destruction due to autoimmune thyroid disease.

Several studies, mostly retrospective, have shown an association between overt hypothyroidism and adverse fetal and obstetric outcomes (e.g. Glinoer 1991).<ref>Glinoer D, Fernandez Soto M, Bourdoux P, Lejeune B, Delange F, Lemone M, et al. "Pregnancy in patients with mild thyroid abnormalities: maternal and neonatal repercussions". J ''Clin Endoc Metab'' 1991;73:421-427</ref> Maternal complications such as [[miscarriages]], [[anaemia]] in pregnancy, [[pre-eclampsia]], [[abruptio placenta]] and [[postpartum haemorrhage]] can occur in pregnant women with overt hypothyroidism. Also, the offspring of these mothers can have complications such as premature birth, low birth weight and increased neonatal respiratory distress.<ref>Davis LE, Leveno KJ, Cunningham FG. "Hypothyroidism complicating pregnancy". ''Obstet Gynecol'' 1988; 72: 108–12.</ref> Similar complications have been reported in mothers with subclinical hypothyroidism. A three-fold risk of placental abruption and a two-fold risk of pre-term delivery were reported in mothers with subclinical hypothyroidism.<ref>Casey BM, Dashe JS, Wells CE et al. "Subclinical hypothyroidism and pregnancy outcomes". ''Obstet Gynecol''. 2005; 105: 239-45.</ref> Another study showed a higher prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in women with pre-term delivery (before 32 weeks) compared to matched controls delivering at term.<ref>Stagnaro-Green A, Chen X, Bogden JD et al. "The thyroid and pregnancy: a novel risk factor for very preterm delivery". ''Thyroid''. 2005; 15: 351-7.</ref> An association with adverse obstetrics outcome has also been demonstrated in pregnant women with thyroid autoimmunity independent of thyroid function. Treatment of hypothyroidism reduces the risks of these adverse obstetric and fetal outcomes; a retrospective study of 150 pregnancies showed that treatment of hypothyroidism led to reduced rates of abortion and premature delivery. Also, a prospective intervention trial study showed that treatment of [[euthyroid]] antibody positive pregnant women led to fewer rates of miscarriage than non treated controls.<ref>Negro R, Formoso G, Mangieri T et al. "Levothyroxine treatment in euthyroid pregnant women with autoimmune thyroid disease: effects on obstetrical complications". ''J Clin Endocrinol Metab''. 2006; 91(7):2587-91.</ref>

It has long been known that [[cretinism]] (i.e. gross reduction in IQ) occurs in areas of severe iodine deficiency due to the fact that the mother is unable to make T4 for transport to the fetus particularly in the first trimester. This neurointellectual impairment (on a more modest scale) has now been shown in an iodine sufficient area (USA) where a study showed that the IQ scores of 7-9 year old children, born to mothers with undiagnosed and untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy, were seven points lower than those of children of matched control women with normal thyroid function in pregnancy.<ref>Haddow JE, Palomaki GE, Allan WC et al. "Maternal thyroid deficiency during pregnancy and subsequent neuropsychological development of the child". ''N Engl J Med.'' 1999 19; 341: 549-55.</ref> Another study showed that persistent hypothyroxinaemia at 12 weeks gestation was associated with an 8-10 point deficit in mental and motor function scores in infant offspring compared to children of mothers with normal thyroid function.<ref>Pop VJ, Brouwers EP, Vader HL et al. "Maternal hypothyroxinaemia during early pregnancy and subsequent child development: a 3-year follow-up study". ''Clin Endocrinol'' (Oxf). 2003;59 :282-8.</ref> Even maternal thyroid [[peroxidase]] antibodies were shown to be associated with impaired intellectual development in the offspring of mothers with normal thyroid function.<ref>Pop VJ, de Vries E, van Baar AL et al. "Maternal thyroid peroxidase antibodies during pregnancy: a marker of impaired child development?" ''J Clin Endocrinol Metab.'' 1995; 80: 3561-6.</ref> However, no association was found between isolated maternal hypothyroxinaemia and adverse perinatal outcomes in 2 large US studies,<ref>Casey BM, Dashe JS, Spong CY et al. "Perinatal significance of isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia identified in the first half of pregnancy". ''Obstet Gynecol.'' 2007; 109: 1129-35.</ref><ref>Cleary-Goldman J, Malone FD, Lambert-Messerlian G et al. "Maternal Thyroid Hypofunction and Pregnancy Outcome" ''Obstet Gynecol'' 2008;112: 85-92</ref> although the behavioural outcomes in the children were not tested in these studies.

===Management of hypothyroidism in pregnancy===
[[Levothyroxine]] is the treatment of choice for hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Thyroid function should be normalised prior to conception in women with pre-existing thyroid disease. Once pregnancy is confirmed the thyroxine dose should be increased by about 30-50% and subsequent titrations should be guided by thyroid function tests (FT4 and TSH) that should be monitored 4-6 weekly until euthyroidism is achieved. It is recommended that TSH levels are maintained below 2.5 mU/l in the first trimester of pregnancy and below 3 mU/l in later pregnancy.<ref>Abalovich M, Amino N, Barbour LA et al. "Management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and postpartum: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline". ''J Clin Endocrinol Metab''. 2007; 92(8 Suppl):S1-47.</ref> The recommended maintenance dose of thyroxine in pregnancy is about 2.0-2.4 mcg/kg daily. Thyroxine requirements may increase in late gestation and return to pre-pregnancy levels in the majority of women on delivery. Pregnant patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (normal FT4 and elevated TSH) should be treated since the condition is associated with maternal and fetal complications.

==Hyperthyroidism==

===Clinical evaluation===
[[Hyperthyroidism]] occurs in about 0.2-0.4% of all pregnancies. Most cases are due to [[Graves’ disease]] although less common causes (e.g. [[Thyroid adenoma|toxic nodules]] and [[thyroiditis]]) may be seen.<ref>Marx H, Amin P, Lazarus JH. "Hyperthyroidism and pregnancy".'' BMJ.'' 2008 22; 336 (7645): 663-7.</ref> Clinical assessment alone may occasionally be inadequate in differentiating hyperthyroidism from the hyperdynamic state of pregnancy. Distinctive clinical features of Graves’ disease include the presence of [[Graves' ophthalmopathy|ophthalmopathy]], diffuse goitre and [[pretibial myxoedema]]. Also, hyperthyroidism must be distinguished from gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, a self-limiting hyperthyroid state due to the thyroid stimulatory effects of [[beta-hCG]] . This distinction is important since the latter condition is typically mild and will not usually require specific antithyroid treatment. Hyperthyroidism due to Graves’ disease may worsen in the first trimester of pregnancy, remit in later pregnancy, and subsequently relapse in the postpartum.

===Risks of hyperthyroidism on fetal and maternal well-being===
Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of severe [[pre-eclampsia]] and up to a four-fold increased risk of low birth weight deliveries. Some of these unfavourable outcomes are more marked in women who are diagnosed for the first time in pregnancy.

Uncontrolled and inadequately treated maternal hyperthyroidism may also result in fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism<ref>Zimmerman D. "Fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism". ''Thyroid''. 1999;9: 727-33</ref> due to the transplacental transfer of stimulatory TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs).<ref>Polak M, Le Gac I, Vuillard E et al. "Fetal and neonatal thyroid function in relation to maternal Graves' disease". ''Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab''. 2004;18: 289-302. 
</ref> Clinical neonatal hyperthyroidism occurs in about 1% of infants born to mothers with Graves’ disease. Rarely neonatal hypothyroidism may also be observed in the infants of mothers with Graves’ hyperthyroidism. This may result from [[transplacental]] transfer of circulating maternal anti-thyroid drugs, [[hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis|pituitary-thyroid axis]] suppression from transfer of maternal thyroxine.

===Management of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy===
Ideally a woman who is known to have hyperthyroidism should seek pre-pregnancy advice, although as yet there is no evidence for its benefit. Appropriate education should allay fears that are commonly present in these women. She should be referred for specialist care for frequent checking of her thyroid status, thyroid antibody evaluation and close monitoring of her medication needs. Medical therapy with anti-thyroid medications is the treatment of choice for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.<ref>Mestman JH. "Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy". ''Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab''. 2004; 18 267-88.</ref> [[Methimazole]] and [[propylthiouracil]] (PTU) are effective in preventing [[pregnancy complications]] by hyperthyroidism.<ref name=Vissenberg2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms007}}</ref> Surgery is considered for patients who suffer severe adverse reactions to anti-thyroid drugs and this is best performed in the second trimester of pregnancy. [[Radioactive iodine]] is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy and the puerperium.  If a woman is already receiving [[carbimazole]], a change to [[propylthiouracil]] (PTU) is recommended but this should be changed back to carbimazole after the first trimester. This is because carbimazole can rarely be associated with skin and also mid line defects in the fetus but PTU long term also can cause liver side effects in the adult. Carbimazole and PTU are both secreted in breast milk but evidence suggests that antithyroid drugs are safe during lactation.<ref>Mandel SJ, Cooper DS. "The use of antithyroid drugs in pregnancy and lactation". ''J Clin Endocrinol Metab''. 2001;86 :2354-9.</ref> There are no adverse effects on IQ or psychomotor development in children whose mothers have received antithyroid drugs in pregnancy. 

Current guidelines suggest that a pregnant patient should be on PTU during the first trimester of pregnancy due to lower tetragenic effect and then be switched to methimazole during the second and third trimester due to lower liver dysfunction side effects.

==Postpartum Thyroiditis==
<!-- merge into [[Postpartum thyroiditis]] -->
Postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD) is a syndrome of thyroid dysfunction occurring within the first 12 months of delivery as a consequence of the postpartum immunological rebound that follows the immune tolerant state of pregnancy. PPTD is a destructive thyroiditis with similar pathogenetic features to [[Hashimoto’s thyroiditis]].<ref>Muller AF, Drexhage HA, Berghout A. "Postpartum thyroiditis and autoimmune thyroiditis in women of childbearing age: recent insights and consequences for antenatal and postnatal care". ''Endocr Rev''. 2001; 22:605-30.</ref>

The disease is very common with a prevalence of 5-9% of unselected postpartum women. Typically there is a transient hyperthyroid phase that is followed by a phase of hypothyroidism. Permanent hypothyroidism occurs in as much as 30% of cases after 3 years, and in 50% at 7 – 10 years. The hyperthyroid phase will not usually require treatment but, rarely, [[propanolol]] may be used for symptom control in severe cases. The hypothyroid phase should be treated with thyroxine if patients are symptomatic, planning to get pregnant, or if TSH levels are above 10 mU/L. Long-term follow up is necessary due to the risk of permanent hypothyroidism.
Nearly all the women with PPTD have positive TPO antibodies.  This marker can be a useful screening test in early pregnancy as 50% of women with antibodies will develop thyroid dysfunction postpartum. In addition some but not all studies have shown an association between PPTD and depression so that thyroid function should be checked postpartum in women with mood changes.
