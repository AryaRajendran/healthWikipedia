This article deals with medicine as practiced by trained professionals from ancient times to the present.  The ancient Egyptians had a [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|system of medicine]] that was very advanced for its time and influenced later medical traditions. The Egyptians and Babylonians both introduced the concepts of [[diagnosis]], [[prognosis]], and [[medical examination]]. The Greeks went even further, and advanced as well [[medical ethics]]. The [[Hippocratic Oath]], still taken by doctors today, was written in Greece in the 5th century BCE. In the medieval era, surgical practices inherited from the ancient masters were improved and then systematized in [[Rogerius (physician)|Rogerius's]] ''The Practice of Surgery''. Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy. During the Renaissance, understanding of anatomy improved, and the microscope was invented.  The [[germ theory of disease]] in the 19th century led to cures for many infectious diseases. Military doctors advanced the methods of trauma treatment and surgery.  Public health measures were developed especially in the 19th century as the rapid growth of cities required systematic sanitary measures. Advanced research centers opened in the early 20th century, often connected with major hospitals.  The mid-20th century was characterized by new biological treatments, such as antibiotics. These advancements, along with developments in chemistry, genetics, and lab technology (such as the [[x-ray]]) led to [[modern medicine]]. Medicine was heavily professionalized in the 20th century, and  new careers opened to women as nurses (from the 1870s) and as physicians (especially after 1970). The 21st century is characterized by very advanced research involving numerous fields of science.

Although there is no record to establish when plants were first used for medicinal purposes ([[herbalist|herbalism]]), the use of plants as healing agents is a long-standing practice. Over time through emulation of the behavior of fauna a medicinal knowledge base developed and was passed between generations. As tribal culture specialized specific castes, [[Shaman]]s and [[apothecary|apothecaries]] performed the 'niche occupation' of healing.

[[File:Hieroglyphic-brain.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The [[Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus]], written in the 17th century BCE, contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain]]

[[Ancient Egypt]] developed a large, varied and fruitful medical tradition. [[Herodotus]] described the Egyptians as "the healthiest of all men, next to the Libyans",<ref>{{Cite book | title = [[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]] | author = [[Herodotus]] | chapter = Chapter 77, Book II | language = [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&layout=&loc=2.77.3 English translation]}}</ref> due to the dry climate and the notable [[public health system]] that they possessed. According to him, the practice of medicine is so specialized among them that each physician is a healer of one disease and no more."  Although Egyptian medicine, to a good extent, dealt with the supernatural,<ref>{{cite book | author = Nunn, John F. | title = Ancient Egyptian Medicine | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | year = 2002}}</ref> it eventually developed a practical use in the fields of anatomy, public health, and clinical diagnostics.

Medical information in the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] may date to a time as early as 3000&nbsp;BCE.<ref>J. H. Breasted, ''The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus'', University of Chicago Press, 1930</ref>  The earliest known [[surgery]] was performed around 2750&nbsp;BCE. [[Imhotep]] in the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|3rd dynasty]] is sometimes credited with being the founder of ancient Egyptian medicine and with being the original author of the ''Edwin Smith Papyrus'', detailing cures, ailments and [[anatomical]] observations. The ''Edwin Smith Papyrus'' is regarded as a copy of several earlier works and was written c. 1600&nbsp;BCE. It is an ancient textbook on surgery almost completely devoid of magical thinking and describes in exquisite detail the ''examination, diagnosis, treatment,'' and ''prognosis'' of numerous ailments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9032043&query=Edwin%20Smith%20papyrus&ct= |title=Edwin Smith papyrus - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>

The  [[Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus]]<ref>Griffith, F. Ll. ''The Petrie Papyri: Hieratic Papyri from Kahun and Gurob''</ref> treats women's complaints, including problems with conception. Thirty four cases detailing diagnosis and treatment survive, some of them fragmentarily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/kahunpapyrus.htm |title=The Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus |publisher=Reshafim.org.il |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> Dating to 1800&nbsp;BCE, it is the oldest surviving medical text of any kind.

Medical institutions, referred to as ''Houses of Life'' are known to have been established in ancient Egypt as early as the [[First dynasty of Egypt|1st Dynasty]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The earliest known physician is also credited to [[History of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]]: [[Hesy-Ra]], “Chief of Dentists and Physicians” for King [[Djoser]] in the 27th century&nbsp;BCE.<ref>[[Helaine Selin]], Hugh Shapiro, eds., ''Medicine Across Cultures: History and Practice of Medicine in Non-Western Cultures,'' Springer 2003, p.35</ref> Also, the earliest known woman physician, [[Peseshet]], practiced in [[Ancient Egypt]] at the time of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]].

=== Middle East ===
{{Further|Babylonian Medicine}}

The oldest Babylonian texts on medicine date back to the [[Old Babylonian]] period in the first half of the [[2nd millennium BCE|2nd&nbsp;millennium&nbsp;BCE]]. The most extensive Babylonian medical text, however, is the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' written by the ''ummânū'', or chief scholar, [[Esagil-kin-apli]] of [[Borsippa]],<ref name=Horstmanshoff_99/> during the reign of the Babylonian king [[Adad-apla-iddina]] (1069-1046&nbsp;BCE).<ref>Marten Stol, ''Epilepsy in Babylonia'', (1993) p. 55,</ref>

Along with the Egyptians the Babylonians introduced the practice of diagnosis, prognosis, physical examination, and remedies. In addition, the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' introduced the methods of [[therapy]] and [[etiology]]. The text contains a list of medical symptoms and often detailed empirical observations along with logical rules used in combining observed symptoms on the body of a patient with its diagnosis and prognosis.<ref name=Horstmanshoff_97_98>{{Harvnb|Horstmanshoff|Tilburg|Stol|2004|pp=97-98}}</ref>

The ''Diagnostic Handbook'' was based on a logical set of axioms and assumptions, including the modern view that through the examination and inspection of the symptoms of a patient, it is possible to determine the patient's disease, its aetiology and future development, and the chances of the patient's recovery. The symptoms and diseases of a patient were treated through therapeutic means such as bandages, herbs and [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]].<ref name=Horstmanshoff_99>{{Harvnb|Horstmanshoff|Tilburg|Stol|2004|pp=99}}</ref>

There was little development after the medieval era.  Major European treatises on medicine took 200 years to reach the Middle East, where local rulers might consult Western doctors to get the latest treatments.  Medical works in Arabic, Turkish, and Persian as late as 1800 were based on medieval Islamic medicine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Porter|first=Roy|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 4: 18th Century Based Science|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780511468339|page=661-3}}</ref> 

=== India ===
{{Main|Ayurveda|Unani}}

The [[Atharvaveda]], a sacred text of [[Hinduism]] dating from the [[Iron Age India|Early Iron Age]], is the first Indian text dealing with medicine, like the medicine of the Ancient Near East based on concepts of the [[exorcism]] of demons and [[magical thinking|magic]]. The Atharvaveda also contain  prescriptions of herbs for various ailments. The use of herbs to treat ailments would later form a large part of [[Ayurveda]].

In the first millennium BCE, there emerges in post-Vedic India the traditional medicine system known as [[Ayurveda]], meaning the "complete knowledge for long life". Its two most famous texts belong to the schools of [[Charaka]], born c. 600 BCE, and [[Sushruta]], born 600 BCE. While these writings display some limited continuities with the earlier medical ideas known from the  [[Vedas]], historians{{Who|date=April 2010}} have been able to demonstrate direct historical connections between early Ayurveda and the early literature of the [[Shramana|Buddhists and Jains]].
The earliest foundations of Ayurveda were built on a synthesis of traditional herbal practices  together with a massive addition of theoretical conceptualizations, new [[nosology|nosologies]] and new therapies dating from about 400 BCE onwards, and coming out of the communities of thinkers who included the Buddha and others.<ref>Kenneth G. Zysk, ''Asceticism and Healing in Ancient India: Medicine in the Buddhist Monastery,'' Oxford University Press, rev. ed. (1998) ISBN 0-19-505956-5</ref>

According to the compendium of [[Charaka]], the [[Charaka Samhita|Charakasamhitā]], health and disease are not predetermined and life may be prolonged by human effort. The compendium of [[Sushruta|Suśruta]], the [[Sushruta Samhita|Suśrutasamhitā]] defines the purpose of medicine to cure the diseases of the sick, protect the healthy, and to prolong life. Both these ancient compendia include details of the examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous ailments.  The [[Sushruta Samhita|Suśrutasamhitā]] is notable for describing procedures on various forms of [[surgery]], including [[rhinoplasty]], the repair of torn ear lobes, perineal [[lithotomy]], cataract surgery, and several other excisions and other surgical procedures. Most remarkable is Sushruta's penchant for scientific classification:
His medical treatise consists of 184 chapters, 1,120 conditions are listed, including injuries and illnesses relating to ageing and mental illness. The Sushruta Samhita describe 125 surgical instrument, 300 surgical procedures and classifies human surgery in 8 categories <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlFilePath=journals/ijps/vol4n2/sushruta.xml |title=Sushruta: The first Plastic Surgeon in 600 B.C. |publisher=ISPUB |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>

The Ayurvedic classics mention eight branches of medicine: kāyācikitsā ([[internal medicine]]), śalyacikitsā (surgery including anatomy), śālākyacikitsā (eye, ear, nose, and throat diseases), kaumārabhṛtya (pediatrics), bhūtavidyā (spirit medicine), and agada tantra ([[toxicology]]), rasāyana
(science of rejuvenation), and vājīkaraṇa (aphrodisiacs, mainly for men).
Apart from learning these, the student of Āyurveda was expected to know ten arts that were indispensable in the preparation and application of his medicines: distillation, operative skills, cooking, horticulture, metallurgy, sugar manufacture, pharmacy, analysis and separation of minerals, compounding of metals, and preparation of [[alkalis]].  The teaching of various subjects was done during the instruction of relevant clinical subjects.  For example, teaching of anatomy was a part of the teaching of surgery, embryology was a part of training in pediatrics and obstetrics, and the knowledge of physiology and pathology was interwoven in the teaching of all the clinical disciplines.
The normal length of the student's training appears to have been seven years.  But the physician was to continue to learn.<ref>Dominik Wujastyk, ed., ''The Roots of Ayurveda,'' Penguin (2003) ISBN 0-14-044824-1</ref>

As an alternative form of medicine in India, [[Unani medicine]] got deep roots and royal patronage during medieval times. It progressed during Indian sultanate and [[Mughal Empire|mughal]] periods. Unani medicine is very close to Ayurveda. Both are based on theory of the presence of the elements (in Unani, they are considered to be fire, water, earth and air) in the human body. According to followers of Unani medicine, these elements are present in different fluids and their balance leads to health and their imbalance leads to illness.<ref>Arab Medicine during the Ages by Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman, Studies in History of Medicine and Science, IHMMR, New Delhi, Vol. XIV, No. 1-2, 1996, p. 1-39</ref>

By the 18th century A.D., Sanskrit medical wisdom still dominated. Muslim rulers built  large hospitals in 1595 in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], and in [[History of Delhi|Delhi]] in 1719, and numerous commentaries on ancient texts were written.  Some European plants and medicinals were gradually incorporated into the Indian pharmacopeia, but otherwise there was little intellectual exchange with the West.<ref name="Deepak Kumar 2003 pp 680-3">Deepak Kumar, "India" in Roy Porter, ed, ''The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 4: 18th-century Science'' (2003) pp 680-3</ref>

=== China ===
{{Main|Medicine in China|Traditional Chinese medicine}}

China also developed a large body of traditional medicine. Much of the philosophy of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] derived from empirical observations of disease and illness by [[Taoist]] physicians and reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. These causative principles, whether material, essential, or mystical, correlate as the expression of the natural order of the universe.

The foundational text of Chinese medicine is the [[Huangdi Neijing|Huangdi neijing]], or ''Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon'', written 5th century to 3rd century BCE).<ref>Unschuld (2003), 1.</ref>  near the end of the 2nd century AD, during the Han dynasty, [[Zhang Zhongjing]], wrote a ''[[Shang Han Lun|Treatise on Cold Damage]]'', which contains the earliest known reference to the ''[[Neijing Suwen]]''. The [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] practitioner and advocate of [[acupuncture]] and [[moxibustion]], [[Huangfu Mi]] (215-282), also quotes the [[Yellow Emperor]] in his ''Jiayi jing'', c. 265.  During the [[Tang Dynasty]], the ''Suwen'' was expanded and revised, and is now the best extant representation of the foundational roots of traditional Chinese medicine.  [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] that is based on the use of herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage and other forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years. 

In the 18th century, during the Qing dynasty, there was a proliferation of popular books as well as more advanced encyclopedias on traditional medicine.  Jesuit missionaries introduced Western science and medicine to the royal court, the Chinese physicians ignored them.<ref>Frank Dikotter, "China" in Roy Porter, ed, ''The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 4: 18th-century Science'' (2003) pp 695-7</ref>

Finally in the 19th century, Western medicine was introduced at the local level by Christian medical missionaries from the [[London Missionary Society]] (Britain), the [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church (Britain) and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian Church (USA)]].  [[Benjamin Hobson]] (1816-1873) in 1839, set up a highly successful Wai Ai Clinic in Guangzhou, China.<ref>{{cite book|author1=TJ Hinrichs et al.|author2=Linda L Barnes|title=Chinese Medicine and Healing: An Illustrated History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dtsYe0ZFORcC&pg=PA197|year=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=197}}</ref> The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was founded in 1887 by the [[London Missionary Society]], with its first graduate (in 1892) being [[Sun Yat-sen]], who later led the [[Chinese Revolution (1911)]]. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the [[University of Hong Kong]], which started in 1911.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male doctors. The missionaries sent women doctors such as Dr. Mary H. Fulton (1854-1927). Supported by the Foreign Missions Board of the Presbyterian Church (USA) she in 1902 founded the first medical college for women in China, the Hackett Medical College for Women, in Guangzhou.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward T.

===Homer===
Around 800 BCE [[Homer]] in ''[[The Iliad]]'' gives descriptions of wound treatment by "the two sons of [[Asklepios]], the admirable physicians [[Podaleirius]] and [[Machaon (physician)|Machaon]] and one acting doctor, [[Patroclus]]. Because Machaon is wounded and Podaleirius is in combat [[Eurypylus]] asks Patroclus “to cut out this arrow from my thigh, wash off the blood with warm water and spread soothing ointment on the wound."  Askelpios like Imhotep becomes god of healing over time. Temples dedicated to the healer-god [[Asclepius]], known as ''[[Asclepeion|Asclepieia]]'' ({{lang-grc|Ἀσκληπιεῖα}}, sing. {{lang|grc|Ἀσκληπιεῖον}}, '''Asclepieion''), functioned as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book |last=Risse |first=G.

Some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place, but with the patient in a state of enkoimesis induced with the help of soporific substances such as opium.<ref name="Askitopoulou, H. 2002 p.11-17"/>

The first known Greek medical school opened in [[Cnidus]] in 700 BCE. [[Alcmaeon]], author of the first anatomical work, worked at this school, and it was here that the practice of observing patients was established.  As was the case elsewhere, the ancient Greeks developed a humoral medicine system where treatment sought to restore the balance of [[Classical element|humours]] within the body.

===Hippocrates===
A towering figure in the history of medicine was the physician [[Hippocrates]] of [[Kos]] (c. 460 – c. 370 BCE), considered the "father of modern medicine."<ref>[http://www.medicinaantiqua.org.uk/sa_hippint.html Hippocrates: The "Greek Miracle" in Medicine]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/trepanationz/hippocrates/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080228084033/http://www.geocities.com/trepanationz/hippocrates/ |archivedate=2008-02-28 |title=The Father of Modern Medicine: Hippocrates |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-02-28 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>  The [[Hippocratic Corpus]] is a collection of around seventy early medical works from ancient Greece strongly associated with Hippocrates and his students.  Most famously, Hippocrates invented the [[Hippocratic Oath]] for physicians, which is still relevant and in use today.

[[Hippocrates]] and his followers were first to describe many diseases and medical conditions. He is given credit for the first description of [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the fingers, an important diagnostic sign in chronic suppurative lung disease, [[lung cancer]] and [[Cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic heart disease]]. For this reason, clubbed fingers are sometimes referred to as "Hippocratic fingers".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Hippocrates was also the first physician to describe [[Hippocratic face]] in ''Prognosis''. [[Shakespeare]] famously alludes to this description when writing of [[Falstaff]]'s death in Act II, Scene iii. of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Hippocrates began to categorize illnesses as [[Acute (medical)|acute]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] and [[epidemic]], and use terms such as, "exacerbation, [[relapse]], resolution, crisis, [[paroxysm]], peak, and [[convalescence]]."<ref name="Silverberg1967">{{cite book|last=Silverberg|first=Robert|title=The dawn of medicine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5IyFf8j7JrUC|accessdate=16 January 2013|year=1967|publisher=Putnam}}</ref><ref name="Loudon2002">{{cite book|last=Loudon|first=Irvine|title=Western Medicine: An Illustrated History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dJEWZq0bq8kC|accessdate=16 January 2013|date=2002-03-07|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199248131}}</ref><ref name="Nutton2012">{{cite book|last=Nutton|first=Vivian|title=Ancient Medicine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uWGr2Be9NjMC|accessdate=16 January 2013|date=2012-12-20|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415520942}}</ref>
 Another of Hippocrates's major contributions may be found in his descriptions of the symptomatology, physical findings, surgical treatment and prognosis of [[Empyema|thoracic empyema]], i.e. [[suppuration]] of the lining of the chest cavity. His teachings remain relevant to present-day students of [[Pulmonology|pulmonary medicine]] and surgery. Hippocrates was the first documented [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|chest surgeon]] and his findings are still valid.[[Image:Kos Asklepeion.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View of the ''Askleipion'' of [[Kos]], the best preserved instance of an Asklepieion.]]

Two great [[Alexandria]]ns laid the foundations for the scientific study of anatomy and physiology, [[Herophilus of Chalcedon]] and [[Erasistratus of Ceos]].<ref name="Longrigg1993">{{cite book|last=Longrigg|first=James|title=Greek Rational Medicine: Philosophy and Medicine from Alcmaeon to the Alexandrians|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TT5lzingflYC|accessdate=16 January 2013|year=1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415025942}}</ref> Other Alexandrian surgeons gave us; ligature (hemostasis), lithotomy, hernia operations, ophthalmic surgery, plastic surgery, methods of reduction of dislocations and fractures,tracheotomy, and mandrake as anesthesia.

[[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], working at the medical school of [[Alexandria]] placed intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.  He and his contemporary, [[Erasistratus|Erasistratus of Chios]], researched the role of veins and [[nerve]]s, mapping their courses across the body.  Erasistratus connected the increased complexity of the surface of the human brain compared to other animals to its superior [[intelligence]]. He sometimes employed [[experiment]]s to further his research, at one time repeatedly weighing a caged bird, and noting its weight loss between feeding times.  In [[Erasistratus]]' physiology, air enters the body, is then drawn by the lungs into the heart, where it is transformed into vital spirit, and is then pumped by the arteries throughout the body. Some of this vital spirit reaches the [[Human brain|brain]], where it is transformed into animal spirit, which is then distributed by the nerves.<ref>Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 57</ref>

===Galen===
The Greek [[Galen]] was one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations—including brain and eye [[surgery|surgeries]]— that were not tried again for almost two millennia. Later, in medieval Europe, Galen's writings on anatomy became the mainstay of the medieval physician's university curriculum along; but they suffered greatly from stasis and intellectual stagnation. In the 1530s, however, Belgian anatomist and physician [[Andreas Vesalius]] took on a project to translate many of Galen's Greek texts into Latin.  Vesalius's most famous work, ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form.<ref>Dear, Peter. ''Revolutionizing the Sciences: European Knowledge and Its Ambitions, 1500-1700.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press (2001), 37-39.</ref> The works of [[Galen]] were regarded as authoritative until well into the Middle Ages.

The [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]] rose to primacy in medical science as its [[physician]]s contributed significantly to the field of medicine, including [[anatomy]], [[ophthalmology]], [[pharmacology]], [[pharmacy]], [[physiology]], [[surgery]], and the [[pharmaceutical sciences]]. The Arabs were influenced by, and further developed Greek, Roman and Byzantine medical practices. [[Galen]] & [[Hippocrates]] were pre-eminent authorities.The translation of 129 works of ancient Greek physician [[Galen]] into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] by [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] and his assistants, and in particular Galen's insistence on a rational systematic approach to medicine, set the template for [[Islamic medicine]], which rapidly spread throughout the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arab Empire]].

[[Image:ScuolaMedicaMiniatura.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A miniature depicting the Schola Medica Salernitana]]

After 400 A.D., most of the medical institutions of the Roman Empire broke down and disappeared.  Medical services were provided, especially for the poor, in the thousands of monasteries that sprang up across Europe.  Rich nobles gave permanent endowments to the monasteries, in the expectation that these good works would lead to their salvation, and lessen their time in purgatory.  Catholic theology held that the sick, especially the poor peasants, would also gain grace and lessen their own time in purgatory, through their suffering.  Most of the medical advances of the Roman empire were forgotten, at his medicine relied increasingly on folk remedies.<ref>Roy Porter, ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind. A medical history of humanity'' (1997)   pp 106-34</ref>

Wallis identifies a prestige hierarchy with university educated physicians on top, followed by learned surgeons; craft-trained surgeons; barber surgeons; itinernant specialists such as dentist and oculists; empirics; and midwives.<ref>Faith Wallis, ''Medieval Medicine: A Reader'' (2010) p 361</ref>

====Schools====
The first medical schools were opened, most notably the [[Schola Medica Salernitana]] at Salerno in southern Italy. The cosmopolitan influences from Greek, Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew sources gave it an international reputation as the Hippocratic City.  Students from wealthy families came for  three years of preliminary studies and five of medical studies. Graduates were awarded the degree of "magister" (Latin for  doctor); indeed physicians were 1st called "doctor" at  Salerno.  By the thirteenth century the medical school at Montpellier began to eclipse the Salernitan school.  In the 12th century universities were founded in Italy, France and England which soon developed schools of medicine. The [[University of Montpellier]] in France and Italy's [[University of Padua]] and [[University of Bologna]] were leading schools.  Nearly all the learning was from lectures and readings in  Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna and Aristotle. There was little clinical work or dissection.

====Humours====
[[Image:13th century anatomical illustration - sharp.jpg|thumb|270px|13th century illustration showing the veins.]]
The underlying principle of most medieval medicine was Galen's theory of [[Humorism|humours]]. This was derived from the ancient medical works, and dominated all western medicine until the 19th century. The theory stated that within every individual there were four humours, or principal fluids - black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood, these were produced by various organs in the body, and they had to be in balance for a person to remain healthy.  Too much phlegm in the body, for example, caused lung problems; and the body tried to cough up the phlegm to restore a balance. The balance of humours in humans could be achieved by diet, medicines, and by [[blood-letting]], using leeches. The four humours were also associated with the four seasons, black bile-autumn, yellow bile-summer, phlegm-winter and blood-spring.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicola Barber|title=Medieval Medicine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iIHm2TegTwYC&pg=PA13|year=2012|publisher=Heinemann-Raintree Library|page=13}}</ref>

Healing included both physical and spiritual therapeutics, such as the right herbs, a suitable, diet, clean bedding, and the sense that care was always at hand. Other procedures used to help patients included the Mass, prayers, relics of saints, and music used to calm a troubled mind or quickened pulse.<ref>Barbara S. Bowers, ed. ''The Medieval Hospital and Medical Practice'' (2007) p 89</ref>

== Renaissance to Early Modern period 16th-18th century==
The Renaissance brought an intense focus on scholarship to Christian Europe. A major effort to translate the Arabic and Greek scientific works into Latin emerged. Europeans gradually became experts not only the ancient writings of the Romans and Greeks, but in the contemporary writings of Islamic scientists. During the later centuries of the Renaissance came an increase in experimental investigation, particularly in the field of dissection and body examination, thus advancing our knowledge of human anatomy.<ref>Nancy G. Siraisi,  " Medicine, 1450–1620, and the History of Science," ''Isis'' (2012) 103#3 pp 491-514  DOI: 10.1086/667970</ref>

The development of modern neurology began in the 16th century with [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]], who described the anatomy of the brain and other organs; he had little knowledge of the brain's function, thinking that it resided mainly in the ventricles. Over his lifetime he corrected over 200 of [[Galen]]'s mistakes. Understanding of medical sciences and diagnosis improved, but with little direct benefit to health care. Few effective drugs existed, beyond [[opium]] and [[quinine]]. Folklore cures and potentially poisonous metal-based compounds were popular treatments.
Independently from [[Ibn al-Nafis]], [[Michael Servetus]] rediscovered the [[pulmonary circulation]], but this discovery did not reach the public cause it was written down for the first time in the "Manuscript of Paris"<ref>[http://michaelservetusresearch.com/ENGLISH/works.html Michael Servetus Research] Website with a graphical study on the Manuscript of Paris by Servetus</ref> in 1546, and later published in the theological work which he paid with his life in 1553. Later this was perfected by [[Renaldus Columbus]] and [[Andrea Cesalpino]]. Later [[William Harvey]] provided a refined and complete description of the [[circulatory system]]. The most useful tomes in medicine used both by students and expert physicians were [[Materia Medica]] and [[Pharmacopoeia]].

=== Paracelsus ===
[[Paracelsus]] (1493-1541), was an erratic and abusive innovator who rejected Galen and bookish knowledge, calling for experimental research, with heavy doses of mysticism, alchemy and magic mixed in.  The point is that he rejected sacred magic (miracles) under Church auspisces and looked for cures in nature.<ref>Charles Webster, "Paracelsus Confronts the Saints: Miracles, Healing and the Secularization of Magic," ''Social History of Medicine'' (1995) 8#3 pp 403-421</ref>         He preached but he also pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine. His [[Hermeticism|hermetical]] views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man ([[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]) and Nature ([[macrocosm]]). He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.<ref>Charles Webster, ''Paracelsus: Medicine, Magic, and Mission at the End of Time'' (Yale Univ. Press, 2008)</ref> Most of his influence came after his death.  Paracelsus is a highly controversial figure in the history of medicine, with most experts hailing him as a Father of Modern Medicine for shaking off religious orthodoxy and inspiring many researchers; others say he was a mystic more than a scientist and downplay his importance.<ref>Roy Porter, ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind'' (1997), 201-11</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Krieger|title=Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ib8Qhju9EQEC&pg=PR27|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|pages=xxvii – xxviii}}</ref>

=== Padua and Bologna ===
[[File:Vesalius Fabrica p190.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Vesalius's ''Fabrica'' contained many intricately detailed drawings of human dissections, often in allegorical poses.]]

University training of physicians began in the 13th century.

The [[University of Padua]] began teaching medicine in 1222. It played a leading role in the identification and treatment of diseases and ailments, specializing in autopsies and the inner workings of the body.<ref>Jerome J. Bylebyl, "The School of Padua: humanistic medicine in the 16th century," in Charles Webster, ed., ''Health, Medicine and Mortality in the Sixteenth Century'' (1979) ch10</ref>  Starting in 1595, Padua's famous anatomical theatre drew artists and scientists studying the human body during public dissections. The intensive study of Galen led to critiques of Galen modeled on his own writing, as in the first book of Vesalius's ''De humani corporis fabrica.'' [[Andreas Vesalius]] held the chair of Surgery and Anatomy (''explicator chirurgiae'') and in 1543 published his anatomical discoveries in [[De Humani Corporis Fabrica]]. He portrayed the human body as an interdependent system of organ groupings.  The book triggered  great public interest in dissections and caused many other European cities to establish anatomical theatres.<ref>Roberto Lo Presti, "Anatomy as Epistemology: The Body of Man and the Body of Medicine in Vesalius and his Ancient Sources (Celsus, Galen)," ''Renaissance and Reformation/Renaissance et Reforme'' (2010) 33#3 pp 27-60</ref>

At the [[University of Bologna]] the training of physicians began in 1219. The Italian city attracted students from across Europe.  Taddeo Alderotti  built a tradition of medical education that established the characteristic features of Italian learned medicine and was copied by medical schools elsewhere. [[Turisanus]] (d. 1320) was his student.<ref>Nancy G. Siraisi, '' Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine: An Introduction to Knowledge and Practice'' (1990)  p 21</ref>  The curriculum was revised and strengthened in 1560-1590.<ref>David A. Lines, "Reorganizing the Curriculum: Teaching and Learning in the University of Bologna, c. 1560-c. 1590,"  ''History of Universities'' (2012) 25#2 pp 1-59</ref>  A representative professor was [[Julius Caesar Aranzi]] (Arantius) (1530–89). He became Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at the University of Bologna in 1556, where he established anatomy as a major branch of medicine for the first time. Aranzi combined anatomy with a description of pathological processes, based largely on his own research, Galen, and the work of his contemporary Italians.  Aranzi discovered the 'Nodules of Aranzio' in the semilunar valves of the heart and wrote the first description of the superior levator palpebral and the coracobrachialis muscles. His books (in Latin) covered surgical techniques for many conditions, including [[hydrocephalus]], [[nasal polyp]], [[goitre]] and [[tumor|tumours]] to [[phimosis]], [[ascites]], [[hemorrhoid|haemorrhoids]], [[anorectal abscess|anal abscess]] and [[fistula]]e.<ref>Raffi Gurunluoglu et al. "Giulio Cesare Aranzio (Arantius) (1530-89) in the pageant of anatomy and surgery," ''Journal of Medical Biography'' (2011) 19#2 pp 63-69</ref>

===Women===
Catholic women played large roles in health and healing in medieval and early modern Europe.<ref>Mary E. Fissell,  "Introduction: Women, Health, and Healing in Early Modern Europe," ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' (2008) 82#1 pp 1-17</ref>  A life as a nun was a prestigious role; wealthy families provided dowries for their daughters, and these funded the convents, while the nuns provided free nursing care for the poor.<ref>Monica Green, "Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe," in ''Sisters and Workers in the Middle Ages,'' ed. J. M. Bennett et al. (University of Chicago Press, 1989), pp. 39–78</ref>

The Catholic elites provided hospital services because of their theology of salvation that good works were the route to heaven. The Protestant reformers rejected the notion that rich men could gain God's grace through good works—and thereby escape purgatory—by providing cash endowments to charitable institutions. They also rejected the Catholic idea that the poor patients earned grace and salvation through their suffering.<ref>{{cite book|author=C. Scott Dixon et al.|title=Living With Religious Diversity in Early-Modern Europe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l9fVJYNd61oC&pg=PA129|year= 2009|publisher=Ashgate |pages=128–30}}</ref>  Protestants generally closed all the convents<ref>Amy E.  Leonard, "Female Religious Orders," in R. Po-chia Hsia, ed., ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2004) pp  237-254</ref> and most of the hospitals, sending women home to become housewives, often against their will.<<ref>{{cite book|author1=Andrew Cunningham|author2=Ole Peter Grell|title=Health Care and Poor Relief in Protestant Europe 1500-1700|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dd-44kXLh1QC&pg=PA130|year= 2002|publisher=Routledge|pages=130–33}}</ref>  On the other hand, local officials recognized the public value of hospitals, and some were continued in Protestant lands, but without monks or nuns and in the control of local governments.<ref>{{cite book|author=Virpi Mäkinen|title=Lutheran Reformation And the Law|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5Dkk1CDZ1UsC&pg=PA227|year=2006|publisher=BRILL|pages=227–29}}</ref> 

In London, the crown allowed two hospitals to continue their charitable work, under nonreligious control of city officials.<ref>{{cite book|author=Keir Waddington|title=Medical Education at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 1123-1995|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mi5cV5D0SkAC&pg=PA18|year=2003|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|page=18}}</ref>  The convents were all shut down but Harkness finds that women—some of them former nuns—were part of a new system that delivered essential medical services to people outside their family. The were employed by parishes and hospitals, as well as by private families, and provided nursing care as well as some  medical, pharmaceutical, and surgical services.<ref>Deborah E. Harkness,  "A View from the Streets: Women and Medical Work in Elizabethan London," ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' (2008) 82#1 pp 52-85</ref>

Meanwhile, in Catholic lands such as France, rich families continued to fund convents and monasteries, and enrolled their daughters as nuns who provided free health services to the poor.  Nursing was a religious role for the nurse, and there was little call for science.<ref>Tim McHugh, "Expanding Women’s Rural Medical Work in Early Modern Brittany: The Daughters of the Holy Spirit," ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences'' (2012) 67#3 pp  428-456.

===Age of Enlightenment===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the 18th-century, science was held in high esteem and physicians upgraded their social status by becoming more scientific.  The health field was crowded with self-trained barber-surgeons, apothecaries, midwives, drug peddlers, and charlatans.

Across Europe medical schools relied primarily on lectures and readings.  In the final year student would have limited clinical experience by trailing the professor through the wards.  Laboratory work was uncommon, and dissections were rarely done because of legal restrictions on cadavers.  Most schools were small, and only Edinburgh, Scotland, with 11,000 alumni, produced large numbers of graduates.<ref>Thomas H.  Broman, "The Medical Sciences,"   in Roy Porter, ed, ''The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 4: 18th-century Science'' (2003) pp 465-8</ref><ref>Lisa Rosner, ''Medical Education in the Age of Improvement: Edinburgh Students and Apprentices 1760-1826'' (1991)</ref>

====Britain====
In Britain, there but three small hospitals after 1550. Pelling and Webster estimate that in London in the 1580 to  1600 period, out of a population of nearly 200,000 people, there were about 500 medical practitioners.  Nurses and  midwives are not included. There were  about 50 physicians, 100 licensed surgeons, 100 apothecaries, and 250 additional unlicensed practitioners. In the last category about 25% were women.<ref>Margaret Pelling and Charles Webster, "Medical Practitioners," in Webster, ed., ''Health, Medicine, and Mortality in the Sixteenth Century'' (1979), p. 183.</ref>  All across Britain—and indeed all of the world—the vast majority of the people in city, town or countryside depended for medical care on local amateurs with no professional training but with a reputation as wise healers who could diagnose problems and advise sick people what to do—and perhaps set broken bones, pull a tooth, give some traditional herbs or brews or perform a little magic to cure what ailed them.

The London Dispensary opened in 1696, the first clinic in the British Empire to dispense medicines to poor sick people.  The innovation was slow to catch on, but new dispensaries were open in the 1770s.  In the colonies, small hospitals opened in Philadelphia in 1752, New York in 1771, and Boston ([[Massachusetts General Hospital]]) in 1811.

[[Image:Guy's Hospital00.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Guy's Hospital 1820 </center>]]
[[Guy's Hospital]], the first great British hospital opened in 1721 in London, with funding from businessman [[Thomas Guy]].  In 1821 a bequest of £200,000 by William Hunt in 1829 funded expansion for an additional hundred beds. [[Samuel Sharp (surgeon)|Samuel Sharp]] (1709–78), a surgeon at Guy's Hospital, from 1733 to 1757, was internationally famous; his ''A Treatise on the Operations of Surgery'' (1st ed., 1739), was the first British study focused exclusively on operative technique.<ref>John Kirkup, "Samuel Sharp and the 'Operations Of Surgery,' 1739," ''Journal of Medical Biography'' (1996) 4#1 pp 1-7.</ref>

English physician [[Thomas Percival]] (1740-1804) wrote a comprehensive system of medical conduct, ''Medical Ethics, or a Code of Institutes and Precepts, Adapted to the Professional Conduct of Physicians and Surgeons'' (1803) that set the standard for many textbooks.<ref>Ivan  Waddington, "The Development of Medical Ethics - A Sociological Analysis," ''Medical History'' (1975) 19#1 pp 36-51</ref>

== 19th century: Rise of modern medicine ==
[[Image:Enrique Simonet - La autopsia - 1890.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''Anatomy of the heart'' (1890) by [[Enrique Simonet]].]]

The practice of medicine changed in the face of rapid advances in science, as well as new approaches by physicians. Hospital doctors began much more systematic analysis of patients' symptoms in diagnosis.<ref>Mary Fissell, "The Disappearance of the Patient's Narrative and the Invention of Hospital Medicine," in ''British Medicine in an Age of Reform'' ed. by Roger French and Andrew Wear, (1991).</ref> Among the more powerful new techniques were anaesthesia, and the development of both antiseptic and aseptic operating theatres.<ref>Guenter B. Risse, ''Mending Bodies, Saving Souls: A History of Hospitals'' (1999)</ref> Actual cures were developed for certain endemic infectious diseases. However the decline in many of the most lethal diseases was more due to improvements in public health and nutrition than to medicine. It was not until the 20th century that the application of the [[scientific method]] to medical research began to produce multiple important developments in medicine, with great advances in [[pharmacology]] and surgery.

Medicine was revolutionized in the 19th century and beyond by advances in chemistry and laboratory techniques and equipment, old ideas of infectious disease [[epidemiology]] were replaced with [[bacteriology]] and [[virology]].
[[Bacteria]] and [[microorganisms]] were first observed with a [[microscope]] by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1676, initiating the scientific field [[microbiology]].<ref name=Brock>{{cite book | author = Madigan M, Martinko J (editors) | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 11th | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-13-144329-1 }}</ref>

===Germ theory===
In Vienna [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] (1818–1865) in 1847 dramatically reduced the death rate of new mothers from [[childbed fever]] by the simple expedient of requiring physicians to [[hand washing|clean their hands]] before attending to women in [[childbirth]]. His discovery pre-dated the [[germ theory of disease]]. However, his discoveries were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into general use only with discoveries of British surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], who in 1865 proved the principles of [[antisepsis]] in the treatment of wound.

[[Louis Pasteur]], by laboratory work that linked microorganisms with disease, brought about a revolution in medicine; he successfully reached out to instruct the educated classes of France in the importance of the germ theory.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bruno Latour|title=The Pasteurization of France|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J26KoKtyTxkC|year=1993|publisher=Harvard U.P.}}</ref> Pasteur with [[Claude Bernard]] (1813–1878) invented the process of [[pasteurization]] still in use today. Pasteur, along with [[Robert Koch]] founded bacteriology. Koch, who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1905,  became famous for the discovery of the [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis|tubercle bacillus]] (1882) and the [[Vibrio cholerae|cholera bacillus]] (1883) and for his development of [[Koch's postulates]].

The quality of military medicine differed sharply among nations. A comparison of British and French surgical work on wounded sailors at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] of 1805 shows that Royal Navy surgeons practiced triage, amputated immediately rather than delay the operation, and kept surgical areas clean. They were well trained and practiced up-to-date methods of surgery and hygiene. By contrast, French surgeons tolerated unhygienic facilities and had less training and skill, resulting in much higher mortality rates for their patients.<ref>James Watt, "Surgery at Trafalgar," ''Mariner's Mirror'' (2005) 91#2 pp 266-283.</ref>

===Women===
{{main|Women in medicine}}

====Women as nurses====
Women had always served in ancillary roles, and as midwives and healers.  The professionalization of medicine forced them increasingly to the sidelines. As hospitals multiplied they relied in Europe on orders of Roman Catholic nun-nurses, and German Protestant and Anglican deaconesses in the early 19th century. They were trained in traditional methods of physical care that involved little knowledge of medicine. The  breakthrough to professionalization based on knowledge of advanced medicine was led by [[Florence Nightingale]] in England. She resolved to provide more advanced training than she saw on the Continent. At Kaiserswerth, where the first German nursing schools was founded in 1836 by [[Theodor Fliedner]], she said, "The nursing was nil and the hygiene horrible."<ref>{{cite book|author=Monica F. Baly|title=Nursing and Social Change|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_pZCpAISbVkC&pg=PA113|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|page=113}}</ref>)  Britain's male doctors preferred the old system, but Nightingale won out and her Nightingale Training School opened in 1860 and became a model. The Nightingale solution depended on the patronage of upper class women, and they proved eager to serve. Royalty became involved. In 1902 the wife of the British king took control of the nursing unit of the British army, became its president, and renamed it after herself as  the [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps]]; when she died the next queen became president. Today its Colonel In Chief is [[HRH The Countess of Wessex|the daughter-in-law of Queen Elizabeth]].  In the United States, upper middle class women  who already supported hospitals promoted nursing. The new profession proved highly attractive to women of all backgrounds, and schools of nursing opened in the late 19th century. They soon a function of large hospitals, where they provided a steady stream of low-paid idealistic workers. The International Red Cross began operations in numerous countries in the late 19th century, promoting nursing as an ideal profession for middle class women.<ref>M. Patricia Donahue, ''Nursing, The Finest Art: An Illustrated History'' (3rd ed. 2010) pp 112-25</ref> 

The Nightingale model was widely copied. [[Linda Richards]] (1841 – 1930) studied in London and became the professionally trained American nurse. She established nursing training programs in the United States and Japan, and created the first system for keeping individual medical records for hospitalized patients.<ref>Mary Ellen Doona, "Linda Richards and Nursing in Japan, 1885-1890," ''Nursing History Review'' (1996) Vol. 4, p99-128</ref>  The Russian Orthodox Church sponsored seven orders of nursing sisters in the late 19th century. They ran hospitals, clinics, almshouses, pharmacies, and shelters as well as training schools for nurses. In the Soviet era (1917-1991), with the aristocratic sponsors gone, nursing became a low-prestige occupation based in poorly maintained hospitals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Henry Walter Morton|title=The Contemporary Soviet City|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=79haNx8rZBQC&pg=PA142|year=1984|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|pages=142–45}}</ref>

====Women as doctors====
It was very difficult for women to become doctors before the 1970s. [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]] (1821–1910) became the first woman to formally study  and practice medicine in the United States.  She was a leader in women's medical education. While Blackwell viewed medicine as a means for social and moral reform, her student [[Mary Putnam Jacobi]] (1842-1906) focused on curing disease. At a deeper level of disagreement, Blackwell felt that women would succeed in medicine because of their humane female values, but Jacobi believed that women should participate as the equals of men in all medical specialties using identical methods, values and insights.<ref>Regina Markell Morantz, "Feminism, Professionalism and Germs: The Thought of Mary Putnam Jacobi and Elizabeth Blackwell," ''American Quarterly'' (1982)  34:461-478. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2712640 in JSTOR]</ref>

===Paris ===
Paris and Vienna were the two leading medical centers on the Continent in the era 1750-1914.

In 1770s-1850s Paris became a world center of medical research and teaching. The "Paris School" emphasized that teaching and research should be based in large hospitals and promoted the professionalization of the medical profession and the emphasis on sanitation and public health. A major reformer was [[Jean-Antoine Chaptal]] (1756-1832), a physician who was Minister of Internal Affairs. He created the Paris Hospital, health councils, and other bodies.<ref>Dora B. Weiner and Michael J.  Sauter, "The City of Paris and the Rise of Clinical Medicine," ''Osiris'' (2003) 18#1 pp 23-42</ref>

[[Louis Pasteur]] (1822-1895) was one of the most important founders of [[medical microbiology]]. He is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and preventions of diseases. His discoveries reduced mortality from [[puerperal fever]], and he created the first [[vaccine]]s for [[rabies]] and [[anthrax]]. His experiments supported the [[germ theory of disease]]. He was best known to the general public for inventing a method to treat milk and wine in order to prevent it from causing sickness, a process that came to be called [[pasteurization]]. He is regarded as one of the three main founders of [[microbiology]], together with [[Ferdinand Cohn]] and [[Robert Koch]].  He worked chiefly in Paris and in 1887 founded the [[Pasteur Institute]] there to perpetuate his commitment to basic research and its practical applications. As soon as his institute was created, Pasteur brought together scientists with various specialties. The first five departments were directed by [[Emile Duclaux]] (general [[microbiology]] research) and [[Charles Chamberland]] (microbe research applied to [[hygiene]]), as well as a biologist, [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]] (morphological microbe research) and two [[physician]]s, [[Jacques-Joseph Grancher]] ([[rabies]]) and [[Emile Roux]] (technical microbe research). One year after the inauguration of the Institut Pasteur, Roux set up the first course of microbiology ever taught in the world, then entitled ''Cours de Microbie Technique'' (Course of microbe research techniques). It became the model for numeous research centers around the world named "Pasteur Institutes."<ref>Moira Davison  Reynolds, '' How Pasteur Changed History: The Story of Louis Pasteur and the Pasteur Institute'' (1994)</ref><ref name="Paul Weindling 1992">Paul Weindling, "Scientific elites and laboratory organization in fin de siècle Paris and Berlin: The Pasteur Institute and Robert Koch’s Institute for Infectious Diseases compared," in Andrew Cunningham and Perry Williams, eds. ''The Laboratory Revolution in Medicine (Cambridge University Press, 1992) pp: 170–88.</ref>

===Vienna===
The First Viennese School of Medicine, 1750-1800, was led by the Dutchman [[Gerard van Swieten]] (1700-1772), who aimed to put medicine on new scientific foundations - promoting unprejudiced clinical observation, botanical and chemical research, and introducing simple but powerful remedies. When the [[Vienna General Hospital]] opened in 1784, it at once became the world's largest hospital and physicians acquired a facility that gradually developed into the most important research centre.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paula Sutter Fichtner|title=Historical Dictionary of Austria|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TKkuN007YcYC&pg=PA326|year= 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|pages=326–27}}</ref>  Progress ended with the Napoleonic wars and the government shutdown in 1819 of all liberal journals and schools; this caused a general return to traditionalism and eclecticism in medicine.<ref>Nelly Tsouyopoulos, "The Influence of John Brown's Ideas in Germany" ''Medical History'' (1988). Supplement no. 8: pp 63–74 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2557344/ online].</ref>

Vienna was the capital of a diverse empire and attracted not just Germans but Czechs, Hungarians, Jews, Poles and others to its world-class medical facilities.  After 1820 the Second Viennese School of Medicine emerged with the contributions of physicians such as [[Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky]], [[Josef Škoda]], [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra]], and [[Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis]]. Basic medical science expanded and specialization advanced. Furthermore, the first dermatology, eye, as well as ear, nose, and throat clinics in the world were founded in Vienna.  The textbook of ophthalmologist [[Georg Joseph Beer]] (1763-1821) ''Lehre von den Augenkrankheiten'' combined practical research and philosophical speculations, and became the standard reference work for decades.<ref>Erna Lesky, ''The Vienna Medical School of the 19th Century'' (John Hopkins University Press, 1976)</ref>

===Berlin===
After 1871 Berlin, the capital of the new German Empire, became a leading center for medical research. [[Robert Koch]] (1843-1910) was a representative leader.  He became famous for isolating ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' (1877), the ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis|Tuberculosis bacillus]]'' (1882) and ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' (1883) and for his development of [[Koch's postulates]]. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1905 for his tuberculosis findings.

In the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65), as was typical of the 19th century, more soldiers died of disease than in battle, and even larger numbers were temporarily incapacitated by wounds, disease and accidents.<ref>George Worthington   Adams, ''Doctors in Blue: The Medical History of the Union Army in the Civil War'' (1996), [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0807121053/  excerpt and text search]; Glenna R.  Schroeder-Lein, ''The Encyclopedia of Civil War Medicine'' (2012) [http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Civil-War-Medicine/dp/0765621304/  excerpt and text search].</ref>  Conditions were poor in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], where doctors and medical supplies were in short supply.<ref>H.H. Cunningham, ''Doctors in Gray: The Confederate Medical Service'' (1993) [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0807118567/ excerpt and text search]</ref>  The war had a dramatic long-term impact on American medicine, from surgerical technique to hospitals to nursing and to research facilities.

The hygiene of the training and field camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of chicken pox, mumps, whooping cough, and, especially, measles. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid fever, and malaria. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.<ref>Kenneth Link, "Potomac Fever: The Hazards of Camp Life," ''Vermont History,'' (1983) 51#2 pp 69-88</ref> 

This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department,<ref>Mary C. Gillett, ''The Army Medical Department, 1818-1865'' (1987)</ref> and the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], a new private agency.<ref>William Quentin Maxwell, ''Lincoln's Fifth Wheel: The Political History of the U.S. Sanitary Commission'' (1956)</ref> Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the [[United States Christian Commission]] as well as smaller private agencies.<ref>Justin Martin,  ''Genius of Place: The Life of Frederick Law Olmsted'' (2011) pp 178-230</ref>

The U.S. Army learned many lessons and in 1886, it established the Hospital Corps.

===Statistical methods===
[[File:Nightingale-mortality.jpg|thumb|right|"''[[polar area diagram|Diagram]] of the causes of mortality in the army in the East''" by Florence Nightingale.]]

A major breakthrough in epidemiology came with the introduction of statistical maps and graphs. They allowed careful analysis of seasonality issues in disease incidents, and the maps allowed public health officials to identifical critical loci for the dissemination of disease.  [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] in London developed the methods. English nurse [[Florence Nightingale]] pioneered analysis of large amounts of statistical data, using graphs and tables, regarding the condition of thousands of patients in the Crimean War to evaluate the efficacy of hospital services. Her methods proved convincing and led to reforms  in military and civilian hospitals, usually with the full support of the government.<ref>M. Eileen Magnello, "Victorian statistical graphics and the iconography of Florence Nightingale's polar area graph," ''BSHM Bulletin: Journal of the British Society for the History of Mathematics'' (2012) 27#1 pp 13-37</ref>

By the late 19th and early 20th century English statisticians led by [[Francis Galton]], [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Ronald Fisher]] developed the mathematical tools such as correlations and hypothesis tests that made possible much more sophisticated analysis of  statistical data.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Brian S. Everitt|author2=Christopher Palmer|title=Encyclopaedic Companion to Medical Statistics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sn1odhRXaCkC&pg=PT447|year= 2011|publisher= Wiley|pages=447–8}}</ref>

During the U.S. Civil War the Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns.  The pioneer was [[John Shaw Billings]] (1838-1913). A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built the [[Library of the Surgeon General's Office]] (now the [[National Library of Medicine]], the centerpiece of modern medical information systems.<ref>He also built the [[New York Public Library]]</ref> Billings figured out how to mechanically analyze medical and demographic data by turning facts into numbers and punching the numbers onto cardboard cards that could be sorted and counted by machine. The applications were developed by his assistant [[Herman Hollerith]]; Hollerith invented the punch card and counter-sorter system that dominated statistical data manipulation until the 1970s.  Hollerith's company became [[IBM|International Business Machines (IBM)]] in 1911.<ref>James H. Cassedy, "Numbering the North's Medical Events: Humanitarianism and Science in Civil War Statistics," ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine,'' (1992) 66#2 pp 210-233</ref>

===Worldwide dissemination===

====Japan====
European ideas of modern medicine were spread widely through the world by medical missionaries, and the dissemination of textbooks.  Japanese elites enthusiastically embraced Western medicine after the [[Meiji Restoration]] of the 1860s.  However they had been prepared by their knowledge of the Dutch and German medicine, for they had some contact with Europe through the Dutch. Highly influential  was the 1765 edition of Hendrik van Deventer's pioneer work ''Nieuw Ligt'' ("A New Light") on Japanese obstetrics, especially on Katakura Kakuryo's publication in 1799 of ''Sanka Hatsumo'' ("Enlightenment of Obstetrics").<ref>R. M. F. van der Weiden,  and G. C. Uhlenbeck, "European 18th-century obstetrical pioneers in Japan: a new light in the Empire of the Sun," ''Journal of Medical Biography'' (2010) 18#2 pp 99-101.</ref><ref>Salvatore Ciriacono, "Scientific Transfer between Europe and Japan: The Influence of Dutch and German Medicine from the Edo Period to the Meiji Restoration," ''Comparativ: Leipziger Beiträge zur Universalgeschichte und Vergleichenden Gesellschaftsforschung'' (2010) 20#6 pp 134-153.</ref>   A cadre of Japanese physicians began to interact with Dutch doctors, who introduced smallpox vaccinations. By 1820 Japanese ranpô medical practitioners not only translated Dutch medical texts, they integrated their readings with clinical diagnoses.  These men became leaders of the modernization of medicine in their country. They broke from Japanese traditions of closed medical fraternities and adopted the European approach of an open community of collaboration based on expertise in the latest scientific methods.<ref>Ann Jannetta, ''The Vaccinators: Smallpox, Medical Knowledge and the “Opening” of Japan'' (2007)</ref>

[[Kitasato Shibasaburō]]  (1853-1931) studied bacteriology in Germany under [[Robert Koch]]. In 1891  he founded the Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, which introduced the study of bacteriology to Japan. He and French researcher [[Alexandre Yersin]] went to Hong Kong in 1894, where; Kitasato confirmed  Yersin's discovery that the bacterium ''Yersinia pestis'' is the agent of the plague.  In 1897 he isolates and described the organism that caused dysentery.  He became the first dean of medicine at Keio University, and the first president of the Japan Medical Association.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph Patrick Byrne|title=Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&pg=PA339|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=339}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Derek S.

Japanese physicians immediately recognized the values of X-Rays. They were able to purchase the equipment locally from the Shimadzu Company, which developed, manufactured, marketed, and distributed X-Ray machines after 1900.<ref>Pierre-Yves Donzé, "Making medicine a business in Japan: Shimadzu Co. and the diffusion of radiology (1900-1960)," ''Gesnerus'' (2010) 67#2 pp 241-262</ref>  Japan not only adopted German methods of public health in the home islands, but implemented them in its colonies, especially Korea and Taiwan, and after 1931 in Manchuria.<ref>Christos Lynteris, "From Prussia to China: Japanese Colonial Medicine and Got o Shinpei's Combination of Medical Police and Local Self-Administration," ''Medical History'' (2011) 55#3 pp 343-347</ref>  A heavy investment in sanitation resulted in a dramatic increase of life life expectancy.<ref>Michael Shiyung Liu, ''Prescribing Colonization: The Role of Medical Practices and Policies in Japan-Ruled Taiwan, 1895–1945'' (Ann Arbor: Association for Asian Studies, 2009) 286 pp.</ref>

[[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856–1926) introduced new medical categories of [[mental illness]], which eventually came into [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] usage despite their basis in behavior rather than [[Biopsychiatry controversy|pathology or etiology]]. Shell shock among frontline soldiers exposed to heavy artillery bombardment was first diagnosed by British Army doctors in 1915. By 1916, similar symptoms were also noted in soldiers not exposed to explosive shocks, leading to questions as to whether the disorder was physical or psychiatric.<ref>Caroline Alexander, "The Shock of War," ''Smithsonian'' (2010) 41#5 pp 58-66.</ref> In the 1920s [[surrealism|surrealist]] opposition to psychiatry was expressed in a number of surrealist publications.  In the 1930s several controversial medical practices were introduced including inducing seizures (by [[electroshock]], [[insulin]] or other drugs) or cutting parts of the brain apart ([[leucotomy]] or [[lobotomy]]). Both came into widespread use by psychiatry, but there were grave concerns and much opposition on grounds of basic morality, harmful effects, or misuse.<ref>G. E. Berrios and Roy Porter ''The History of Clinical Psychiatry'' (1995)</ref>

In the 1950s new [[psychiatric drugs]], notably the antipsychotic [[chlorpromazine]], were designed in laboratories and slowly came into preferred use. Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was some opposition, due to serious adverse effects such as [[tardive dyskinesia]]. Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control. There was also increasing opposition to the use of psychiatric hospitals, and attempts to move people back into the community on a collaborative [[World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry|user-led group]] approach ("therapeutic communities") not controlled by psychiatry. Campaigns against [[masturbation]] were done in the [[Victorian era]] and elsewhere. [[Lobotomy]] was used until the 1970s to treat [[schizophrenia]]. This was denounced by the [[anti-psychiatric]] movement in the 1960s and later.

==20th century==

=== First World War ===
The [[ABO blood group system]] was discovered in 1901, and the [[Rhesus group]] in 1937, facilitating [[blood transfusion]].

During the 20th century, large-scale wars were attended with [[medic]]s and [[mobile hospital]] units which developed advanced techniques for healing massive injuries and controlling infections rampant in battlefield conditions. Thousands of scarred troops provided the need for improved [[prosthetic limb]]s and expanded techniques in plastic surgery or [[reconstructive surgery]]. Those practices were combined to broaden [[cosmetic surgery]] and other forms of [[elective surgery]].

During the [[First World War]], [[Alexis Carrel]] and [[Henry Drysdale Dakin|Henry Dakin]] developed the [[Carrel-Dakin method]] of treating wounds with an irrigation, Dakin's solution, a [[germicide]] which helped prevent [[gangrene]].<ref>Mark Harrison, ''The Medical War: British Military Medicine in the First World War'' (2010) [http://www.amazon.com/Medical-War-British-Military-Medicine/dp/0199575827/  excerpt and text search]</ref>

The Great War spurred the usage of [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Roentgen]]'s [[X-ray]], and the [[electrocardiograph]], for the [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] of internal bodily functions.  This was followed in the inter-war period by the development of the first anti-bacterial agents such as the [[sulpha]] antibiotics.

===Public health===
The [[1918 flu pandemic]] killed at least 50 million people around the world.<ref>John M. Barry, ''The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History'' (2004) [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143036491/ref=rdr_ext_tmb reviews, excerpt and text search]</ref> It became an [[Spanish flu research|important case study in epidemiology]].<ref>Fred R. Van Hartesveldt, "The Doctors and the 'Flu': The British Medical Profession's Response to the Influenza Pandemic of 1918-19," ''International Social Science Review'' (2010) 85#1 pp 28-39, online</ref> Bristow shows there was a gendered response of health caregivers to the pandemic in the United States.  Male doctors were unable to cure the patients, and they felt like failures.  Women nurses also saw their patients die, but they took pride in their success in fulfilling their professional role of caring for, ministering, comforting, and easing the last hours of their patients, and helping the families of the patients cope as well.<ref>Nancy K. Bristow, ''American Pandemic: The Lost Worlds of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic'' (Oxford University Press, 2012)</ref>

From 1917 to 1923, the American Red Cross moved into Europe with a battery of long-term child health projects.  It built and operated hospitals and  clinics, and organized antituberculosis and antityphus campaigns.  A high priority involved child health programs such as clinics, better baby shows, playgrounds, fresh air camps, and courses for women on infant hygiene. Hundreds of U.S. doctors, nurses, and welfare professionals administered these programs, which aimed to reform the health of European youth and to reshape European public health and welfare along American lines.<ref>Julia F. Irwin, "Sauvons les Bébés: Child Health and U.S. Humanitarian Aid in the First World War Era," ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' (2012) 86#1 pp 37-65.

Hutchinson, ''Champions of Charity: War and the Rise of the Red Cross'' (1996), pp 224–77</ref>

===Second World War===
[[File:Ww2-53.jpg|thumb|American [[combat surgery]] during the [[Pacific War]], 1943. Major wars have stressed the need for qualified medical treatment and hygiene.]]

The advances in medicine made a dramatic difference for Allied troops, while the Germans and especially the Japanese and Chinese suffered from a severe lack of newer medicines, techniques and facilities.  Harrison finds that the chances of recovery for a badly wounded British infantryman were as much as 25 times better than in the First World War. The reason was that:
:"By 1944 most casualties were receiving treatment within hours of wounding, due to the increased mobility of field hospitals and the extensive use of aeroplanes as ambulances. The care of the sick and wounded had also been revolutionized by new medical technologies, such as active immunization against tetanus, sulphonamide drugs, and penicillin."<ref>Mark Harrison, ''Medicine and Victory: British Military Medicine in the Second World War'' (2004) p 275</ref>

====Nazi and Japanese medicine====
[[Human subject research]], and killing of patients with disabilities, were at the nadir during the Nazi era, with [[Nazi human experimentation]] and [[Aktion T4]] during [[the Holocaust]] as the most significant example, followed up by the [[Doctors' Trial]]. Principles of [[medical ethics]], such as the [[Nuremberg Code]], have been introduced to prevent such atrocities.<ref>Horst H. Freyhofer, ''The Nuremberg Medical Trial: The Holocaust and the Origin of the Nuremberg Medical Code'' (2004) [http://www.questia.com/read/106747886/the-nuremberg-medical-trial-the-holocaust-and-the online]</ref>  After 1937, the Japanese Army established programs of biological warfare in China. In [[Unit 731]], Japanese doctors and research scientists conducted large numbers of vivisections and experiments on human beings, mostly Chinese victims.<ref>Jing Bao Nie, et al. '' Japan's Wartime Medical Atrocities: Comparative Inquiries in Science, History, and Ethics'' (2011)  [http://www.amazon.com/Japans-Wartime-Medical-Atrocities-Transformations/dp/0415682282/  excerpt and text search]</ref>

===Malaria===
{{main|History of malaria}}
Starting in World War II, [[DDT]] was used as insecticide to combat [[insect vector]]s carrying [[malaria]], which was endemic in most tropical regions of the world.<ref>James L. A. Webb, Jr., ''Humanity’s Burden: A Global History of Malaria'' (2009); Randall M. Packard, ''The Making of a Tropical Disease: A Short History of Malaria'' (2007); Leo B. Slater, ''War and Disease: Biomedical Research on Malaria in the Twentieth Century'' (2009).</ref> The first goal was to protect soldiers, but it was widely adopted as a public health device.  In Liberia, for example, the United States had large military operations during the war and the U.S. Public Health Service began the use of DDT for indoor residual spraying (IRS) and as a larvicide, with the goal of controlling malaria in Monrovia, the Liberian capital. In the early 1950s, the project was expanded to nearby villages. In 1953, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) launched an antimalaria program in parts of Liberia as a pilot project to determine the feasibility of malaria eradication in tropical Africa. However these projects encountered a spate of difficulties that foreshadowed the general retreat from malaria eradication efforts across tropical Africa by the mid-1960s.<ref>James L. A.  Webb, "The First Large-Scale Use of Synthetic Insecticide for Malaria Control in Tropical Africa: Lessons from Liberia, 1945–1962," ''Journal of the History of Medicine & Allied Sciences'' (2011) 66#3 pp 347-376 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_medicine_and_allied_sciences/v066/66.3.webb.html in Project MUSE]</ref>

==Post-World War II==
[[File:Fighting smallpox in Niger, 1969.jpg|thumb|[[Smallpox]] vaccination in Niger, 1969. A decade later, this was the first infectious disease to be eradicated.]]
[[File:Life expectancy in some Southern African countries 1958 to 2003.png|thumb|Most countries have seen a tremendous increase in life expectancy since 1945. However, in southern Africa, the [[HIV]] epidemic beginning around 1990 has eroded national health.]]
[[File:Infant with cochlear implant.jpg|left|thumb|A [[cochlear implant]] is a common kind of [[neural prosthesis]], a device replacing part of the [[human nervous system]].]]
The [[World Health Organization]] was founded in 1948 as a [[United Nations]] agency to improve [[global health]]. In most of the world, [[life expectancy]] has improved since then, and was about 67 years as of 2010, and well above 80 years in some countries. [[Eradication of infectious diseases]] is an international effort, and several new [[vaccine]]s have been developed during the post-war years, against infections such as [[measles]], [[mumps]], several strains of [[influenza]] and [[human papilloma virus]]. The long-known vaccine against [[Smallpox]] finally eradicated the disease in the 1970s, and [[Rinderpest]] was wiped out in 2011. [[Eradication of polio]] is underway. [[Tissue culture]] is important for development of vaccines. Though the early success of antiviral vaccines and antibacterial drugs, [[antiviral drugs]] were not introduced until the 1970s. Through the WHO, the international community has developed a response protocol against epidemics, displayed during the [[SARS]] epidemic in 2003, and the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1]] from 2004 and onwards.

As infectious diseases have become less lethal, and the most common [[cause of death|causes of death]] in developed countries are now [[tumor]]s and [[cardiovascular disease]]s, these conditions have received increased attention in medical research. [[Tobacco smoking]] as a cause of [[lung cancer]] was first researched in the 1920s, but was not widely supported by publications until the 1950s. [[Cancer treatment]] has been developed with [[radiotherapy]], [[chemotherapy]] and [[surgical oncology]].

[[Oral rehydration therapy]] has been extensively used since the 1970s to treat [[cholera]] and other diarrhea-inducing infections.

[[Hormonal contraception]] was introduced in the 1950s, and was associated with the [[sexual revolution]], with normalization of [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]] in many countries. [[Family planning]] has promoted a [[demographic transition]] in most of the world. With threatening [[sexually transmitted infections]], not least [[HIV]], use of [[barrier contraception]] has become imperative. The struggle against HIV has improved [[antiretroviral]] treatments, and in the late 2000s (decade), male [[circumcision]] was cited to diminish infection risk (see [[circumcision and HIV]]). In 2013, the first patient was cured from HIV.<ref>http://www.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/2013/Pages/toddlerfunctionallycured.aspx</ref>

[[Medical radiography|X-ray imaging]] was the first kind of [[medical imaging]], and later [[ultrasonic imaging]], [[CT scanning]], [[MR scanning]] and other imaging methods became available.

[[Genetics]] have advanced with the discovery of the [[DNA]] molecule, [[genetic mapping]] and [[gene therapy]]. [[Stem cell]] research took off in the 2000s (decade), with [[stem cell therapy]] as a promising method.

[[Evidence-based medicine]] is a modern concept, not introduced to literature until the 1990s.

[[Prosthetic]]s have improved. In 1958, [[Arne Larsson]] in Sweden became the first patient to depend on an [[artificial cardiac pacemaker]]. He died in 2001 at age 86, having outlived its inventor, the surgeon, and 26 pacemakers. Lightweight materials as well as [[neural prosthetic]]s emerged in the end of the 20th century.

===Modern surgery===
[[Cardiac surgery]] was revolutionized in the late 1940s, as open-heart surgery was introduced.

In 1954 [[Joseph Murray]], [[J. Hartwell Harrison]] and others accomplished the first [[kidney transplantation]]. [[organ transplant|Transplantation]]s of other organs, such as heart, liver and pancreas, were also introduced during the latter 20th century. The first partial [[face transplant]] was performed in 2005, and the first full one in 2010. By the end of the 20th century, [[microtechnology]] had been used to create tiny robotic devices to assist [[microsurgery]] using micro-video and [[fiber optics|fiber-optic]] cameras to view internal tissues during surgery with minimally invasive practices.<ref>Murray, Joseph E., "The First Successful Organ Transplants in Man", Nobel Lect., 1990, Nobelprize.org., Web, July 7, 2010</ref>

[[Laparoscopic surgery]] was broadly introduced in the 1990s. [[Natural orifice surgery]] has followed. [[Remote surgery]] is another recent development, with the [[Lindbergh operation]] in 2001 as a groundbreaking example.
