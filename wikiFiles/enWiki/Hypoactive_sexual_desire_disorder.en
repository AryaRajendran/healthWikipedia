'''Hypoactive sexual desire disorder''' ('''HSDD''') is considered a [[sexual dysfunction]] and is characterized as a lack or absence of [[sexual fantasies]] and [[sexual desire|desire for sexual activity]], as judged by a clinician. For this to be regarded as a disorder, it must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulties and not be better accounted for by another mental disorder, a drug (legal or illegal), or some other medical condition. 

HSDD is listed under the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders of the [[DSM-IV]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington DC |year=2000 |edition=4th }}</ref>  It was first included in the DSM-III under the name Inhibited Sexual Desire Disorder,<ref>{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington DC |year=1980 |edition=3rd }}</ref> but the name was changed in the DSM-III-R.

There are various subtypes.  HSDD can be general (general lack of sexual desire) or situational (still has sexual desire, but lacks sexual desire for current partner), and it can be acquired (HSDD started after a period of normal sexual functioning) or lifelong (the person has always had no/low sexual desire.)

HSDD has garnered much criticism, primarily by [[asexuality|asexual]] activists. They point out that HSDD puts asexuality in the same position [[homosexuality]] was from 1974-1987. Back then, the DSM recognised '[[ego-dystonic homosexuality]]' as a disorder, defined as having sexual interest in the same sex and it causing distress. Despite the DSM itself officially recognizing this as unnecessarily pathologizing homosexuality and removing it as a disorder in 1987,<ref>http://www.dpmp.unsw.edu.au/DPMPWeb.nsf/resources/Presentations/$file/RITTER.pdf Alison Ritter: Appropriate services for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people: More than just gender sensitive?  page 5</ref> the DSM has not recognized HSDD as unnecessarily pathologizing asexuality.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==History==
In the early versions of the DSM, there were only two sexual dysfunctions listed: frigidity (for women) and impotence (for men).

In 1970, [[Masters and Johnson]] published their book ''Human Sexual Inadequacy''<ref>{{cite book |author=Masters, William; Johnson, Virginia |title=Human Sexual Inadequacy |publisher=Little Brown |location=Boston |year=1970 }}</ref> describing sexual dysfunctions, though these included only dysfunctions dealing with the function of genitals such as [[premature ejaculation]] and [[impotence]] for men, and [[anorgasmia]] and [[vaginismus]] for women.  Prior to [[Masters and Johnson]]'s research, [[female orgasm]] was assumed by some to originate primarily from vaginal, rather than clitoral, stimulation. Consequently, feminists have argued that "frigidity" was "defined by men as the failure of women to have vaginal orgasms".<ref>{{cite book |author=Koedt, A. |chapter=The myth of the vaginal orgasm |editor=Escoffier, J. |title=Sexual revolution |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location=New York |year=1970 |isbn=1-56025-525-0 |pages=100–9 }}</ref> 

Following this book, [[sex therapy]] increased throughout the 1970s.  Reports from sex-therapists about people with low sexual desire are reported from at least 1972, but labeling this as a specific disorder did not occur until 1977.<ref>{{cite book |last=Irvine |first=Janice  |title=Disorders of Desire |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |page=265 |ref=harv }}</ref>  In that year, sex therapists [[Helen Singer Kaplan]] and Harold Lief independently of each other proposed creating a specific category for people with low or no sexual desire.  Lief named it "Inhibited Sexual Desire," and Kaplan named it "Hypoactive Sexual Desire." The primary motivation for this was that previous models for sex therapy assumed certain levels of sexual interest in one’s partner and that problems were only caused by abnormal functioning/non-functioning of the genitals or performance anxiety but that therapies based on those problems were ineffective for people who did not sexually desire their partner.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Helen Singer |title=The Sexual Desire Disorders |publisher=Taylor & Francis Group |location=New York |year=1995 |pages=1–2, 7 |ref=harv }}</ref>  The following year, 1978, Lief and Kaplan together made a proposal to the APA’s taskforce for sexual disorders for the DSM III, of which Kaplan and Lief were both members.  The diagnosis of Inhibited Sexual Desire (ISD) was added to the DSM when the 3rd edition was published in 1980.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaplan|1995|pp=7–8}}</ref>

For understanding this diagnosis, it is important to recognize the social context in which it was created.  In some cultures, low sexual desire may be considered normal and high sexual desire is problematic. For example, sexual desire may be lower in East Asian populations than Euro-Canadian/American populations.<ref name="Brotto LA, Chik HM, Ryder AG, Gorzalka BB, Seal B 2005 613–626">{{cite journal |author=Brotto LA, Chik HM, Ryder AG, Gorzalka BB, Seal B |title=Acculturation and sexual function in Asian women |journal=Archives of Sexual Behaviour |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=613–626 |year=2005 |month=December |doi=10.1007/s10508-005-7909-6  |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/7110535123451813/}}</ref>  In other cultures, this may be reversed.  Some cultures try hard to restrain sexual desire.  Others try to excite it.  Concepts of "normal" levels of sexual desire are culturally dependent and rarely value-neutral.  In the 1970s, there were strong cultural messages that sex is good for you and "the more the better."  Within this context, people who were habitually uninterested in sex, who in previous times may not have seen this as a problem, were more likely to feel that this was a situation that needed to be fixed.  They may have felt alienated by dominant messages about sexuality and increasingly people went to sex-therapists complaining of low sexual desire.  It was within this context that the diagnosis of ISD was created.<ref>{{cite book |author=Leiblum, Sandra; Rosen, Raymond |title=Sexual Desire Disorders |publisher=The Guilford Press |year=1988 |page=1 }}</ref>

In the revision of the DSM-III, published in 1987 (DSM-III-R), ISD was subdivided into two categories: Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder and [[Sexual Aversion Disorder]] (SAD).<ref>{{harvnb|Irvine|2005|p=172}}</ref>  The former is a lack of interest in sex and the latter is a phobic aversion to sex.  In addition to this subdivision, one reason for the change is that the committee involved in revising the psychosexual disorders for the DSM-III-R thought that term "inhibited" suggests psychodynamic etiology (i.e. that the conditions for sexual desire are present, but the person is, for some reason, inhibiting their own sexual interest.)  The term "hypoactive sexual desire" is more awkward, but more neutral with respect to the cause.<ref>{{cite book |author=Apfelbaum, Bernard |chapter=An Ego Analytic Perspective on Desire Disorders |editor=Lieblum, Sandra; Rosen, Raymond |title=Sexual Desire Disorders |publisher=The Guilford Press |year=1988 }}</ref>  The DSM-III-R estimated that about 20% of the population had HSDD.<ref>American Psychological Association (1987)</ref> In the DSM-IV (1994), the criterion that the diagnosis requires "marked distress or interpersonal difficulty" was added.

==Causes==
Low sexual desire alone is not equivalent to HSDD because of the requirement in HSDD that the low sexual desire causes marked distress and interpersonal difficulty and because of the requirement that the low desire is not better accounted for by another disorder in the DSM or by a general medical problem. It is therefore difficult to say exactly what causes HSDD. It is easier to describe, instead, some of the causes of low sexual desire.

In men, though there are theoretically more types of HSDD/low sexual desire, typically men are only diagnosed with one of three subtypes.
*Lifelong/generalized: The man has little or no desire for [[sexual stimulation]] (with a partner or alone) and never had.
*Acquired/situational:  The man was previously sexually interested in his present partner but now lacks sexual interest in them but has desire for sexual stimulation (i.e. alone or with someone other than his present partner.)
*Acquired/generalized:  The man previously had sexual interest in his present partner, but lacks interest in sexual activity, partnered or solitary.

Though it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between these types, they do not necessarily have the same etiology.  The cause of lifelong/generalized HSDD is unknown.  In the case of acquired/generalized low sexual desire, possible causes include various medical/health problems, psychiatric problems, low levels of [[testosterone]] or high levels of [[prolactin]]. One theory suggests that sexual desire is controlled by a balance between inhibitory and excitatory factors.<ref>{{cite book |author=Janssen, E., Bancroft J. |chapter=The dual control model: The role of sexual inhibition & excitation in sexual arousal and behavior |editor=Janssen, E. |title=The Psychophysiology of Sex |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington IN |year=2006 }}</ref> This is thought to be expressed via neurotransmitters in selective brain areas. A decrease in sexual desire may therefore be due to an imbalance between neurotransmitters with excitatory activity like dopamine and norepinephrine and neurotransmitters with inhibitory activity, like serotonin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clayton AH |title=The pathophysiology of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women |journal=Int J Gynaecol Obstet |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=7–11 |year=2010 |month=July |pmid=20434725 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2010.02.014 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020-7292(10)00138-4}}</ref> The, New York-based, [http://newviewcampaign.org/ "New View Campaign"] organization has expressed skepticism about too much emphasis on explanations based on Neurotransmitters because emphasis on such explanations have been made largely by "educational" efforts funded by Boehringer-Ingelheim while it was attempting to get the FDA to approve a drug affecting neurotransmitters for treatment for HSDD.<ref>New View Campaign. Fact Sheet: Marketing. "http://www.newviewcampaign.org/media/pdfs/FlibanserinFactsheet_marketing.pdf"</ref>  Low sexual desire can also be a side effect of various medications.  In the case of acquired/situational HSDD, possible causes include intimacy difficulty, relationship problems, [[sexual addiction]], and chronic illness of the man’s partner.  The evidence for these is somewhat in question.  Some claimed causes of low sexual desire are based on empirical evidence.  However, some are based merely on clinical observation.<ref name=Maurice07>{{cite book |author=Maurice, William |chapter=Sexual Desire Disorders in Men |editor=Leiblum, Sandra |title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2007 |edition=4th }}</ref>  In many cases, the cause of HSDD is simply unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Balon, Richard |title=Toward an Improved Nosology of Sexual Dysfunction in DSM-V |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=24 |issue=9 |year=2007 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/53716?pageNumber=1}}</ref>

The usefulness of the current nosology in the DSM-IV-TR has been criticized for not taking seriously the differences between male and female sexuality (see section on criticism.)  Still, there are some factors that are believed to be possible causes of HSDD in women.  As with men, various medical problems, psychiatric problems (such as mood disorders), or increased amounts of prolactin can cause HSDD.  Other hormones are believed to be involved as well.  Additionally, factors such as relationship problems or stress are believed to be possible causes of reduced sexual desire in women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Warnock JJ |title=Female hypoactive sexual desire disorder: epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=16 |issue=11 |pages=745–53 |year=2002 |pmid=12383030 |url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?issn=1172-7047&volume=16&issue=11&spage=745}}</ref> According to one recent study examining the affective responses and attentional capture of sexual stimuli in women with and without HSDD, women with HSDD do not appear to have a negative association to sexual stimuli, but rather a weaker positive association than women without HSDD <ref>{{cite journal |author=Brauer M, van leeuwen M, Janssen E, Newhouse SK, Heiman JR, Laan E |title=Attentional and Affective Processing of Sexual Stimuli in Women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder |journal=Archives of Sexual Behaviour |year=2011 |month=September |doi=10.1007/s10508-011-9820-7|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w688825666612563/}}</ref>

==Treatment==
HSDD, like many sexual dysfunctions, is something that people are treated for in the context of a relationship. Theoretically, one could be diagnosed with, and treated for, HSDD without being in a relationship. However, relationship status is the most predictive factor accounting for distress in women with low desire and distress is required for a diagnosis of HSDD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosen RC, Shifren JL, Monz BU, Odom DM, Russo PA, Johannes CB |title=Correlates of sexually-related personal distress in women with low sexual desire |journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=1549–1560 |year=2009 |month=June |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01252.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01252.x/}}</ref> Therefore, it is common for both partners to be involved in therapy.  Typically, the therapist tries to find a psychological or biological cause of the HSDD.  Sometimes this is possible and sometimes it is not.  If the HSDD is organically caused, the clinician may try to deal with that.   If the clinician believes it is rooted in a psychological problem, they may recommend therapy for that.  If not, treatment generally focuses more on relationship and communication issues, improved communication (verbal and nonverbal), working on non-sexual intimacy, or education about sexuality may all be possible parts of treatment.  Sometimes problems occur because people have unrealistic perceptions about what normal sexuality is and are concerned that they do not compare well to that, and this is one reason why education can be important.  If the clinician thinks that part of the problem is a result of stress, techniques may be recommended to more effectively deal with that.  Also, it can be important to understand why the low level of sexual desire is a problem for the relationship because the two partners may associate different meaning with sex but not know it.<ref name=Basson07>{{cite book |author=Basson, Rosemary |chapter=Sexual Desire/Arousal Disorders in Women |editor=Leiblum, Sandra |title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2007 |edition=4th }}</ref>

In the case of men, the therapy may depend on the subtype of HSDD.  Increasing the level of sexual desire of a man with lifelong/generalized HSDD is unlikely.  Instead the focus may be on helping the couple to adapt.  In the case of acquired/generalized, it is likely that there is some biological reason for it and the clinician may attempt to deal with that.  In the case of acquired/situational, some form of psychotherapy may be used, possibly with the man alone and possibly together with his partner.<ref name=Maurice07/>

As neurotransmitters and sex hormones have modulatory function on sexual desire, treatment intervention has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials.  [[Intrinsa]] is a testosterone patch that works by releasing the hormone testosterone through the skin into the bloodstream. It is licensed by Procter & Gamble for the use in post-menopausal women with surgical menopause who are also receiving estrogen replacement therapy. [[Flibanserin]], a [[5-HT1A receptor]] agonist and [[5-HT2A receptor]] antagonist, has been investigated by [[Boehringer Ingelheim]] as a novel, non-hormonal treatment for pre-menopausal women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). Development on this medication has since been discontinued by the company.<ref name="October 8th 2010 Boehringer-Ingelheim Press Release">http://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/news/news_releases/press_releases/2010/08_october_2010_fliba.html</ref>
Preclinical evidence suggested that flibanserin targets these receptors preferentially in selective brain areas and helps to restore a balance between inhibitory and excitatory effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pfaus JG |title=Pathways of sexual desire |journal=J Sex Med |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=1506–33 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19453889 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01309.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Allers KA, Dremencov E, Ceci A, ''et al.'' |title=Acute and repeated flibanserin administration in female rats modulates monoamines differentially across brain areas: a microdialysis study |journal=J Sex Med |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=1757–67 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20163532 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01763.x }}</ref>

==Criticism==
HSDD, as currently defined by the DSM has come under criticism of the social function of the diagnosis.
*HSDD could be seen a part of a history of the medicalization of sexuality by the medical profession to define normal sexuality.<ref>{{harvnb|Irvine|2005|pp=175–6}}</ref> It may also over pathologize normal variation in sexuality because the parameters of normality are unclear. This lack of clarity is partly due to the fact that the terms "persistent" and "recurrent" do not have clear [[operational definition]]s.<ref name="Brotto LA, Chik HM, Ryder AG, Gorzalka BB, Seal B 2005 613–626"/> 
*HSDD may function to pathologize [[asexuality|asexuals]], though their lack of sexual desire may not be maladaptive.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Prause N, Graham CA |title=Asexuality: classification and characterization |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=341–56 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17345167 |doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9142-3 |url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/publications/PDF/PrauseGraham.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>  Because of this, some members of the asexual community are lobbying the mental health community working on the [[DSM-V]] to regard asexuality as a legitimate sexual orientation rather than a mental disorder.<ref>Asexuals Push for Greater Recognition. http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/story?id=6656358&page=1</ref>

Other criticisms focus more on scientific and clinical issues.
*HSDD is such a diverse group etiologically that it functions as little more than a starting place for clinicians to assess people.<ref name=Bancroft01>{{cite journal |author=Bancroft J, Graham CA, McCord C |title=Conceptualizing women's sexual problems |journal=J Sex Marital Ther |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=95–103 |year=2001 |pmid=11247236 |doi=10.1080/00926230152051716 }}</ref>
*Research indicates a high degree of comorbidity between HSDD and [[female sexual arousal disorder]]. Therefore, a diagnosis combining the two might be more appropriate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Graham, CA |title=The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Female Sexual Arousal Disorder |journal=Archives of Sexual Behaviour |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=240–255 |year=2010 |month=September |doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9535-1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/a3393180w1x47539/}}</ref>   
*The requirement that low sexual desire causes distress or interpersonal difficulty has been criticized.  It has been claimed that it is not clinically useful because if it is not causing any problems, the person will not seek out a clinician.<ref name=Bancroft01/>  One could claim that this criterion (for all of the sexual dysfunctions, including HSDD) decreases the scientific validity of the diagnoses or is a cover-up for a lack of data on what constitutes normal sexual function.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Althof SE |title=My personal distress over the inclusion of personal distress |journal=J Sex Marital Ther |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=123–5 |year=2001 |pmid=11247205 |doi=10.1080/00926230152051761 }}</ref>
*The distress requirement is also criticized because the term "distress" lacks a clear definition.<ref name="Bancroft J, Graham CA, McCord C 2001 95–103">{{cite journal |author=Bancroft J, Graham CA, McCord C |title=Conceptualizing Women’s Sexual Problems |journal=Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=95–103 |year=2001 |pmid=11247236 |doi=10.1080/00926230152051716 |url=http://ukpmc.ac.uk/abstract/MED/11247236/reload=0;jsessionid=KCiKJtVme61vM1EzfD2U.22}}</ref>  
*It is suggested that a duration criterion should be added because lack of interest in sex over the past month is significantly more common than lack of interest lasting six months.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mitchell KR, Mercer CH |title=Prevalence of Low Sexual Desire among Women in Britain: Associated Factors |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=2434–2444 |year=2009 |month=September |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01368.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01368.x/abstract;jsessionid=46D617142210A940132F924378C139AC.d03t04? |pmid=19549088}}</ref> Similarly, a frequency criterion (i.e., the symptoms of low desire be present in 75% or more of sexual encounters) has been suggested.<ref name="Balon R 2008 186–97">{{cite journal |author=Balon R |title=The DSM Criteria of Sexual Dysfunction: Need for a Change |journal= Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=186–97 |year=2008 |pmid= 18398759 |doi=10.1080/00926230701866067 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00926230701866067}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Segraves R, Balon R, Clayton A |title=Proposal for Changes in Diagnostic Criteria for Sexual Dysfunctions |journal= Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=567–580 |year=2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00455.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00455.x |pmid=17433086}}</ref>   

The current framework for HSDD is based on a linear model of human sexual response, developed by [[Masters and Johnson]] and modified by Kaplan consisting of desire, arousal, orgasm.  The sexual dysfunctions in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] are based around problems at any one or more of these stages.<ref name=Basson07/>  Many of the criticisms of the present DSM framework for sexual dysfunction in general, and HSDD in particular, claim that this models ignores the differences between male and female sexuality.  Several criticisms are based on inadequacy of the current framework for dealing with women's sexual problems.

*Increasingly, evidence shows that there are significant differences between male and female sexuality.  Level of desire is highly variable from woman to woman and there are some women who are considered sexually functional who have no active desire for sex, but they can erotically respond well in contexts they find acceptable.  This has been termed "responsive desire" as opposed to spontaneous desire.<ref name=Basson07/>
*The focus on merely the physiological ignores the social, economic and political factors including sexual violence and lack of access to sexual medicine or education throughout the world affecting women and their sexual health.<ref name=Tiefer02>{{cite journal |author=Tiefer L, Hall M, Tavris C |title=Beyond dysfunction: a new view of women's sexual problems |journal=J Sex Marital Ther |volume=28 |issue=Suppl 1|pages=225–32 |year=2002 |pmid=11898706 |doi=10.1080/00926230252851357 }}</ref>
*The focus on the physiological ignores the relationship context of sexuality despite the fact that these are often the cause of sexual problems.<ref name=Tiefer02/>
*The focus on discrepancy in desire between two partners may result in the partner with the lower level of desire being labeled as "dysfunctional," but the problem really sits with difference between the two partners.<ref name="Bancroft J, Graham CA, McCord C 2001 95–103"/> However, within couples the assessment of desire tends to be relative. That is, individuals make judgments by comparing their levels of desire to that of their partner.<ref name="Balon R 2008 186–97"/>  
*The sexual problems that women complain of often do not fit well into the current DSM framework for sexual dysfunctions.<ref name=Tiefer02/>
*The current system of sub-typing may be more applicable to one gender than the other.<ref name=Maurice07/>

==Recommended revisions==
Given criticisms of the current DSM classification, a new disorder combining the characteristics of HSDD and sexual arousal disorder has been proposed for the next version of the DSM (the DSM-V, due to be published in 2013). The name proposed for this disorder is Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder.<ref name="Brotto LA 2010 221–239">{{cite journal |author=Brotto LA |title=The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in Women |journal= Archives of Sexual Behaviour |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=221–239 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9543-1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r263073710m04123/ |pmid=19777334}}</ref> 
See [[Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder]] for a more extensive review. The criteria proposed for diagnosing this disorder in women are:<ref name="Brotto LA 2010 221–239"/>  

1. Lack of sexual interest/arousal of a least 6 months duration as manifest by at least four of the following indicators: 
*Absent/reduced interest in sexual activity
*Absent/reduced sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies
*No initiation of sexual activity and is not receptive to a partner’s attempts to initiate 
*Absent/reduced sexual excitement/pleasure during sexual activity (on at least 75% or more of sexual encounters) 
*Desire is not triggered by any sexual/erotic stimulus (e.g., written, verbal, visual, etc.) 
*Absent/reduced genital and/or nongenital physical changes during sexual activity (on at least 75% or more of sexual encounters)
2. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment 
Specifier:
*Lifelong or acquired
*Generalized or situational
*Partner factors (partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status) 
*Relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, relationship discord, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity)
*Individual vulnerability factors (e.g., depression or anxiety, poor body image, history of abuse experience) 
*Cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity) 
*Medical factors (e.g., illness/medications)
3. The sexual dysfunction is not better accounted for by another Axis 1 disorder (except for another Sexual Dysfunction) and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.

This classification is desirable compared to the current DSM – IV classification system because: (1) it reflects the finding that desire and arousal tend to overlap (2) it differentiates between women who lack desire before the onset of activity, but who are receptive to initiation and or initiate sexual activity for reasons other than desire, and women who never experience sexual arousal (3) it takes the variability in sexual desire into account. Furthermore, the criterion of 4/6 symptoms be present for a diagnosis helps safeguard against pathologizing adaptive decreases in desire.<ref name="Brotto LA 2010 221–239"/><ref name="Brotto LA 2010 2015–2030">{{cite journal |author=Brotto LA |title=The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in Men |journal= Archives of Sexual Behaviour |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=2015–2030 |year=2010 |month=June |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01860.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01860.x}}</ref> 

The limited research in male sexual desire has revealed that it may differ from female sexual arousal in some respects (e.g., tend to have higher masturbation frequency and often continue to masturbate despite low sexual desire<ref>{{cite journal |author=Janssen E, McBride K, Yarber W, Hill B, Butler S |title=Factor That Influence Sexual Arousal in Men |journal= Archives of Sexual Behaviour |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=252–265 |year=2008 |doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9245-5|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q633659n8255h5jh/}}</ref>), but that there are likely more within-gender than between-gender differences, there are three options under consideration for the diagnosis of low sexual desire in men:<ref name="Brotto LA 2010 2015–2030"/> 
# The DSM-IV-TR name and criteria be preserved for men in the DSM-V
# Proposed criteria for Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder in women be adopted for men (one gender neutral category)   
# The proposed criteria for Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder be adopted for men with the modification that absence or reduced genital and/or non-genital physical changes not be included as criterion
