== Notable works ==
Vondráček's most notable professional work (''Fantastické a magické z hlediska psychiatrie'') was first published in 1968 (State Medical Publishing House,<ref name="VondráčekHolub1968">{{cite book|last1=Vondráček|first1=Vladimír|last2=Holub|first2=František|last3=Feldek|first3=Martin|title=Fantastické a magické z hlediska psychiatrie|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2o0GHQAACAAJ|accessdate=14 July 2012|year=1968|publisher=Státní zdravotnické nakladatelství}}</ref> and most recently in 2003 (Columbus). While the original release was intended for experts, later, the book also became popular among the general public. It was co-authored by František Holub (1894–1965), a lawyer, writer, poet, explorer and Vondráček's longtime friend. The book gives a different interpretation of the mysterious and magical phenomena known from the history, folk tales, legends and fairy tales, and shows that such phenomena could be a result of [[mental disorders]], [[hallucinations]], [[Illusion|illusory phenomena]] and suggestion. People with mental disorders often believe that they can predict the future or read minds, that they're cursed or vice versa 'chosen', that they come from another planet or another time. People with physical defects become an inspiration for stories of dwarfs, giants and werewolves. They assembly ideas inspired stories about [[water sprite]]s, [[centaur]]s or [[vampire]]s. According to Vondráček, tales about haunted castles, evil creations or [[living dead]] were created as a result of hallucinations and suggestions. Vondráček shows the signs of various mental disorders and mental phenomena on examples from history, from myths and fairy tales, but also from his extensive psychiatric practice.

The three-part memoirs ''Doktor vzpomíná'' ("Doctor Recalls", 1895–1920 (1973)), ''Lékař dále vzpomíná'' ("Doctor recalls more", (1920–1938 (1978)) and ''Konec vzpomínání'' ("End of Memories", 1938–1945, published posthumously in 1988) are ranked among the top of Vondráček's literary works. The memoirs show both his phenomenal memory and illustrate his life story, and additionally, they describe the first half of the 20th century with many interesting facts and details. The author discusses openly a number of opinions on people he knew, especially from his medical career. His memoirs end in 1945, because in the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|following period]], it was more complicated to write openly and critically.
