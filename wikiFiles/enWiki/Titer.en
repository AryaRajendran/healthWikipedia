A '''titer''' (or '''titre''') is a way of expressing [[concentration]].<ref name="KaplittLoewy1995">{{cite book|author1=Michael G. Kaplitt|author2=Arthur D.

The titer corresponds to the highest dilution factor that still yields a positive reading.<ref name="Timbury1994">{{cite book|author=Morag Crichton Timbury|title=Notes on medical virology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4ZNrAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=18 March 2012|year=1994|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=978-0-443-04872-2|page=27}}</ref> For example, positive readings in the first 8 serial twofold dilutions translate into a titer of [[Ratio|1:256]] (i.e., 2<sup>−8</sup>). Titers are sometimes expressed by the denominator only, for example 1:256 is written 256.<ref name="FoxBienstock2010">{{cite book|author1=Harold E.

==Examples==
A specific example is a '''viral titer''', which is the lowest concentration of [[virus]] that still infects cells. To determine the titer, several dilutions are prepared, such as 10<sup>−1</sup>, 10<sup>−2</sup>, 10<sup>−3</sup>,...,10<sup>−8</sup>.<ref name="KaplittLoewy1995"/>

The titer of a [[fat]] is the temperature, in degrees Celsius, at which it solidifies.<ref name="O'Brien2008">{{cite book|author=Richard D. O'Brien|title=Fats and oils: formulating and processing for applications|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3wpHj3mvra8C&pg=PA207|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=5 December 2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-6166-6|pages=207}}</ref> The higher the titer, the harder the fat. This titer is used in determining whether an animal fat is considered [[tallow]] (titer higher than 40 °C) or a [[Yellow grease|grease]] (titer below 40 °C).<ref name="vanGerpen">{{cite book
