'''Prothrombin G20210A''' (also the '''prothrombin 20210 mutation''', the '''factor II mutation''', or the '''prothrombin mutation''') is a [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variant]] that approximately doubles or triples the risk of forming blood clots in the [[vein]]s. The variant is commonly associated with the disease [[venous thromboembolism]] (VTE), which includes both [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]]. Most carriers, though, never develop VTE in their lifetime.<ref name=RosendaalReitsma/>

Prothrombin G20210A was identified in the 1990s, is almost exclusively present in [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]s,<ref name=RosendaalReitsma/> and is estimated to have originated in that population slightly over 20,000 years ago.<ref>[http://omim.org/entry/176930#0009 Coagulation factor II; F2: .0009 thrombosis, susceptibility to] OMIM. Accessed January 23, 2012.</ref> About 2 to 3% of Caucasians carry the variant,<ref name=Rosendaal2005/> and it confers a 2- to 3-fold higher risk of VTE. Deficiencies in the anticoagulants [[Protein C]] and [[Protein S]] give a higher risk (5- to 10-fold).<ref name=RosendaalReitsma>{{cite journal |author=Rosendaal FR, Reitsma PH |title=Genetics of VT |journal=J.
