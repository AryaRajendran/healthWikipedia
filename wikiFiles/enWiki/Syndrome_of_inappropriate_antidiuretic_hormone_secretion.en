The '''s'''yndrome of '''i'''nappropriate '''a'''nti'''d'''iuretic '''h'''ormone secretion or SIADH (other names: Schwartz-Bartter syndrome, SIAD—syndrome of immoderate antidiuresis)  is characterized by excessive release of [[Vasopressin|antidiuretic hormone]] from the [[posterior pituitary]] gland or another source. The result is [[hyponatremia]] and sometimes [[fluid overload]]. It is usually found in patients diagnosed with [[pneumonia]], [[brain tumor]]s, head trauma, [[stroke]]s, [[meningitis]], [[encephalitis]], or [[small-cell carcinoma]] of the lung.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} <!-- Unnecessary as the link to Vasopressin is given already, this sentence disturbs the flow. -->   <!-- Vasopressin has other important functions, addressed in the appropriate articles.-->

== Pathophysiology and clinical findings ==
The normal function of ADH on the [[kidney]]s is to control the amount of water reabsorbed by kidney [[nephron]]s. ADH acts in the distal portion of the renal tubule ([[Distal Convoluted Tubule]]) as well as on the [[collecting duct]] and causes the retention of water, but ''not'' solute. Hence, ADH activity effectively dilutes the blood (decreasing the concentrations of solutes such as [[sodium]]).

ADH is secreted to prevent water loss in the kidneys. When water is ingested, it is taken up into the circulation and results in a dilution of the [[Blood plasma|plasma]]. This dilution, otherwise described as a reduction in plasma [[osmolality]], is detected by [[osmoreceptor]]s in the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain and these then switch off the release of ADH. The decreasing concentration of ADH effectively inhibits the [[aquaporin]]s in the collecting ducts and [[distal convoluted tubule]]s in the [[nephron]]s of the kidney.  Hence, less water is reabsorbed, thereby increasing [[urine]] output, decreasing [[urine osmolality]], and normalizing blood osmolality. 
In SIADH the release of ADH is not inhibited by a reduction in plasma osmolality when the individual ingests water and the osmolality of the plasma drops. As the main solute of plasma is sodium, this hypoosmolar state is usually detected as a low sodium level on laboratory testing. SIADH is therefore primarily a condition that results in the abnormal handling of water loading and not a problem with excessive solute loss. This is why it is usually treated with fluid (in particular water) restriction.  Diuretics may also be given to decrease reabsorption of water, but care must be taken not to correct water imbalances too rapidly.

This causes dilutional [[hyponatremia]] and all the consequences associated with that condition: [[headache]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and confusion may ensue. Severe hyponatremia may cause [[convulsion]]s or [[coma]].

The abnormalities underlying type D syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion concern individuals where vasopressin release and response are normal but where abnormal renal expression and translocation of [[aquaporin 2]], or both are found.<ref name="Chu">Chu JY, Lee LT, Lai CH, Vaudry H, Chan YS, Yung WH, Chow BK.(2009). Secretin as a neurohypophysial factor regulating body water homeostasis. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 106:15961–15966. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0903695106}}</ref> It has been suggested that this is due to abnormalities in the secretion of [[secretin]] in the brain and that "Secretin as a neurosecretory hormone from the posterior pituitary, therefore, could be the long-sought vasopressin independent mechanism to solve the riddle that has puzzled clinicians and physiologists for decades."<ref name="Chu"/>

In general, increased ADH causes water retention ''without'' extracellular fluid volume expansion and ''without'' [[edema]] or [[hypertension]]. The water retention causes hyponatremia, which is a key feature in SIADH. This is purely a problem of water metabolism with no abnormalities in total body sodium metabolism.<ref>Onitilo AA, Kio E, Doi SA. Tumor-related hyponatremia. Clin Med Res. 2007 Dec;5(4):228-37.</ref> Hyponatremia and inappropriately concentrated urine (U<sub>Osm</sub> >100 mOsm/L)<ref>Adrogué HJ, Madias NE. Hyponatremia. N Engl J Med. 2000 May 25;342(21):1581-9</ref> are seen, as well as ''no signs of'' edema or [[hypovolemia]]. When hyponatremia is severe (sodium <120 mOsm), or acute in onset, symptoms of [[cerebral edema]] become prominent (irritability, confusion, seizures, and coma).

==Diagnosis==
Laboratory findings in diagnosis of SIADH include:
* [[Hyponatremia|Euvolemic hyponatremia]] <134 mEq/L, and P<sub>Osm</sub> <275 mOsm/kg OR ( P<sub>Osm</sub> - Serum [Urea]<sub>mmol/l</sub> < 280 mOsm/kg )
*Urine osmolality >100mOsm/kg of water during hypotonicity
* Urine sodium concentration >40 mEq/L with normal dietary salt intake
Other findings:
* Clinical euvolemia without edema or ascites
* Low [[blood urea nitrogen]] (BUN)
* Normal serum [[creatinine]]
* Low [[uric acid]]
* Normal Acid-Base, K+ balance
* Normal Adrenal, Thyroid function

==Management==
Management of SIADH includes:
* Treating underlying causes when possible.
* Long-term [[fluid restriction]] of 1,200–1,800 mL/day<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/978-3-540-79565-0_40}}</ref> will increase serum sodium through decreasing total body water.
* For very symptomatic patients (severe confusion, convulsions, or coma) hypertonic saline (3%) 1-2 ml/kg IV in 3-4 h should be given.
* Drugs
** [[Demeclocycline]] can be used in chronic situations when fluid restrictions are difficult to maintain; demeclocycline is the most potent inhibitor of Vasopressin (ADH/AVP) action.  However, demeclocycline has a 2-3 day delay in onset with extensive side effect profile, including skin photosensitivity, and nephrotoxicity.<ref name="Zietse 2009 iii12-iii19">{{cite journal|last=Zietse|first=Robert|coauthors=van der Lubbe N, Hoorn E|title=Current and Future Treatment Options in SIADH|journal=Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation|year=2009|volume=2 [Suppl 3]|pages=iii12–iii19|doi=10.1093/ndtplus/sfp154|pmid=19881932|issue=Suppl_3|pmc=2762827}}</ref>
**Urea: oral daily ingestion has shown favorable long-term results with protective effects in [[Central pontine myelinolysis|myelinosis]] and brain damage.<ref name="Zietse 2009 iii12-iii19"/>  Limitations noted to be undesirable taste and is contraindicated in patients with cirrhosis to avoid initiation or potentiation of [[hepatic encephalopathy]].
** [[Conivaptan]] - an antagonist of both V<sub>1A</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> vasopressin receptors. Its indications are "treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia (e.g. the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, or in the setting of hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, pulmonary disorders, etc.) in hospitalized patients.".<ref name="dailymed">{{cite web |url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=3621#nlm34067-9 |title=Vaprisol (conivaptan hydrochloride) Liquid [Astellas Pharma US, Inc.]|accessdate=2007-06-08 |format= |work=}}</ref>  Conivaptan, however, is only available as a parenteral preparation.<ref name="Zietse 2009 iii12-iii19"/>
** [[Tolvaptan]] - an antagonist of the V<sub>2</sub> vasopressin receptor. A randomized controlled trial showed tolvaptan is able to raise  serum sodium in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia in 2 different tests.  Combined analysis of the 2 trials showed an improvement in hyponatremia in both the short term (primary sodium change in average AUC: 3.62+/- 2.68 and 4.35 +/-2.87) and long term with long term maintenance (primary sodium change in average AUC: 6.22 +/- 4.22 and 6.20 +/- 4.92), at 4 days and 30 days, respectively.  Tolvaptan’s side effect profile is minimal. Discontinuation of the Tolvaptan showed return of hyponatremia to control values at their respective time frames.<ref name="pmid17105757">{{cite journal |author=Schrier RW, Gross P, Gheorghiade M, ''et al.'' |title=Tolvaptan, a selective oral vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, for hyponatremia |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=355 |issue=20 |pages=2099–112 |year=2006 |pmid=17105757 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa065181}}</ref>

No head to head study is currently available to quantify and compare the relative efficacies of V2 vasopressin receptor antagonists with demeclocycline or other treatment options.

Care must be taken when correcting hyponatremia. A rapid rise in the sodium level may cause [[central pontine myelinolysis]].<ref name="pmid11430268">{{cite journal |author=Ashrafian H, Davey P |title=A review of the causes of central pontine myelinosis: yet another apoptotic illness? |journal=Eur. J. Neurol. |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=103–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11430268 |doi=10.1046/j.1468-1331.2001.00176.x}}</ref>
Avoid correction by more than 12 mEq/L/day. Initial treatment with hypertonic saline may abruptly lead to a rapid dilute diuresis and fall in ADH. Rapid diuresis may lead to over-rapid rise in serum sodium, and should be managed with extreme care.

==Differential diagnosis==
[[Cerebral salt wasting syndrome]] also presents with [[hyponatremia]], there are signs of [[dehydration]]. In SIADH, the patient is clinically overloaded or may be euvolaemic.

==History==
The condition was first described by researchers from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and [[Bethesda, Maryland]] (including Dr [[Frederic Bartter]]) in two patients with [[lung cancer]].<ref name="pmid13469824">{{cite journal |author=Schwarts WB, Bennett W, Curelop S, Bartter FC |title=A syndrome of renal sodium loss and hyponatremia probably resulting from inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone |journal=Am.
