'''Laryngeal cancer''' may also be called '''cancer of the larynx''' or '''laryngeal carcinoma'''. Most laryngeal cancers are [[squamous cell carcinoma]]s, reflecting their origin from the [[squamous cell]]s which form the majority of the laryngeal [[epithelium]].
[[Cancer]] can develop in any part of the [[larynx]], but the cure rate is affected by the location of the tumour. For the purposes of tumour [[Cancer staging|staging]], the larynx is divided into three anatomical regions: the [[glottis]] (true vocal cords, anterior and posterior commissures); the [[supraglottis]] ([[epiglottis]], [[arytenoids]] and [[aryepiglottic folds]], and [[false cords]]); and the [[subglottis]].

Most laryngeal cancers originate in the [[glottis]]. Supraglottic cancers are less common, and subglottic tumours are least frequent.

Laryngeal cancer may spread by direct extension to adjacent structures, by [[metastasis]] to regional cervical [[lymph node]]s, or more distantly, through the blood stream. Distant metastates to the [[lung]] are most common.

==Risk factors ==
Smoking is the most important risk factor for laryngeal cancer. Death from laryngeal cancer is 20 times more likely for heaviest smokers than for nonsmokers.<ref>Ridge JA, Glisson BS, Lango MN, et al. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter04/article/10165/1402663 "Head and Neck Tumors"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref> Heavy chronic consumption of [[alcohol]], particularly alcoholic spirits, is also significant. When combined, these two factors appear to have a synergistic effect.
Some other quoted risk factors are likely, in part, to be related to prolonged alcohol and tobacco consumption. These include low socioeconomic status, male sex, and age greater than 55 years.

People with a history of head and [[neck cancer]] are known to be at higher risk (about 25%) of developing a second cancer of the head, neck, or lung. This is mainly because in a significant proportion of these patients, the [[aerodigestive tract]] and lung [[epithelium]] have been exposed chronically to the carcinogenic effects of alcohol and [[tobacco]]. In this situation, a [[field change effect]] may occur, where the epithelial tissues start to become diffusely [[dysplastic]] with a reduced threshold for malignant change. This risk may be reduced by quitting alcohol and tobacco.

==Symptoms ==
The symptoms of laryngeal cancer depend on the size and location of the tumor. Symptoms may include the following:<ref>[http://www.mountsinai.org/Other/Diseases/Laryngeal%20cancer Laryngeal cancer] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]]</ref>

*[[Hoarseness]] or other voice changes
*A lump in the neck
*A [[sore throat]] or feeling that something is stuck in the throat
*Persistent [[cough]]
*[[Stridor]] - a high-pitched wheezing sound indicative of a narrowed or obstructed airway
*[[Bad breath]]
*[[Earache]] ("''referred''")

==Incidence==
Incidence is five in 100,000 (12,500 new cases per year) in the USA.<ref name=AMN>{{cite web | author = Samuel W. Beenken, MD | title =Laryngeal Cancer (Cancer of the larynx)| work =Laryngeal Cancer (Cancer of the larynx) | url=http://www.health.am/cr/laryngeal-cancer/ | publisher=Armenian Health Network, Health.am | accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> The American Cancer Society estimated that 9,510 men and women (7,700 men and 1,810 women) would be diagnosed with and 3,740 men and women would die of laryngeal cancer in 2006.

Laryngeal cancer is listed as a "rare disease" by the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). This means that laryngeal cancer affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S.<ref name=NIH>{{cite web | title =Annual Report on the Rare Diseases and Conditions Research| url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/ | publisher=National Institutes of Health | accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>

Each year, about 2,200 people in the U.K. are diagnosed with laryngeal cancer.<ref name=UK>{{cite web | title =Causes of laryngeal cancer| url=http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Cancertype/Larynx/Causesdiagnosis/Causes | publisher=Cancerbackup-cancerbackup.org.uk | accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>

The disease is also rarely seen in Canada. The disease affected only 128 individuals in the province of [[British Columbia]] in 2009, the majority being males.<ref>{{cite web | title =New Cancer Diagnoses for 2009 | url=http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/NR/rdonlyres/27D69A84-8911-4B97-9073-96F5CEC13961/52377/cso_Incident_Cancer_Report_2009.pdf| publisher=BC Cancer Agency| accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>

==Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is made by the doctor on the basis of a [[medical history]], [[physical examination]], and special investigations which may include a [[chest x-ray]], [[Computed tomography|CT]] or [[MRI]] scans, and tissue biopsy. The examination of the larynx requires some expertise, which may require specialist referral.

The [[physical exam]] includes a systematic examination of the whole patient to assess general health and to look for signs of associated conditions and metastatic disease. The neck and [[supraclavicular fossa]] are palpated to feel for cervical [[adenopathy]], other masses, and laryngeal crepitus. The [[oral cavity]] and [[oropharynx]] are examined under direct vision. The larynx may be examined by [[indirect laryngoscopy]] using a small angled mirror with a long handle (akin to a dentist's mirror) and a strong light. Indirect laryngoscopy can be highly effective, but requires skill and practice for consistent results. For this reason, many specialist clinics now use fibre-optic [[nasal endoscopy]] where a thin and flexible [[endoscope]], inserted through the [[nostril]], is used to clearly visualise the entire [[pharynx]] and larynx. Nasal endoscopy is a quick and easy procedure performed in clinic. [[Local anaesthetic]] spray may be used.

If there is a suspicion of cancer, [[biopsy]] is performed, usually under [[general anaesthetic]]. This provides [[histological]] proof of cancer type and grade. If the [[lesion]] appears to be small and well localised, the surgeon may undertake excision biopsy, where an attempt is made to completely remove the tumour at the time of first biopsy. In this situation, the [[pathologist]] will not only be able to confirm the diagnosis, but can also comment on the completeness of excision, i.e., whether the tumour has been completely removed. A full endoscopic examination of the larynx, [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], and [[esophagus]] is often performed at the time of biopsy. 

For small [[glottic]] tumours further imaging may be unnecessary. In most cases, tumour staging is completed by scanning the head and neck region to assess the local extent of the tumour and any pathologically enlarged cervical [[lymph node]]s.

The final management plan will depend on the site, stage (tumour size, nodal spread, distant [[metastasis]]), and histological type. The overall health and wishes of the patient must also be taken into account. A prognostic multigene classifier has been shown to be potentially useful for the distinction of laryngeal cancer of low or high risk of recurrence and might influence the treatment choice in future.<ref name="PMID 21481529">{{cite journal | author = Mirisola V, Mora R, Esposito AI, Guastini L, Tabacchiera F, Paleari L, Amaro A, Angelini G, Dellepiane M, Pfeffer U, Salami A | title = A prognostic multigene classifier for squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx | journal = Cancer Letters | volume = 307 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–46 | year = 2011 | month = August | pmid = 21481529| doi = 10.1016/j.canlet.2011.03.013}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Specific treatment depends on the location, type, and stage of the tumour. Treatment may involve [[surgery]], [[radiotherapy]], or [[chemotherapy]], alone or in combination. This is a specialised area which requires the coordinated expertise of ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons ([[Otolaryngology|otolaryngologists]]) and [[oncology|oncologists]].
