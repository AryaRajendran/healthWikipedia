'''Snoring''' is the vibration of respiratory structures and the resulting sound, due to obstructed air movement during [[breath]]ing while [[sleep]]ing. In some cases the sound may be soft, but in other cases, it can be loud and unpleasant. Snoring during sleep may be a sign, or first alarm, of [[obstructive sleep apnea]] (OSA).

==Causes==
Generally speaking the structures involved are the [[uvula]] and [[soft palate]]. The irregular airflow is caused by a passageway blockage and is usually due to one of the following:
* Throat weakness, causing the throat to close during sleep.
* Mispositioned jaw, often caused by tension in the muscles.
* Fat gathering in and around the throat.
* Obstruction in the nasal passageway.
* [[Obstructive sleep apnea]].
* The tissues at the top of airways touching each other, causing vibrations.
* Relaxants such as alcohol or drugs relaxing throat muscles.
* Sleeping on one's back, which may result in the tongue dropping to the back of the mouth.

==Impact==
Snoring is known to cause [[sleep deprivation]] to snorers and those around them, as well as daytime [[drowsiness]], [[irritability]], lack of [[focusing|focus]] and decreased [[libido]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Luboshitzky |first=Rafael |coauthors=Ariel Aviv, Aya Hefetz, Paula Herer, Zila Shen-Orr, Lena Lavie and Peretz Lavie |date=March 23, 2002 |title= Decreased Pituitary-Gonadal Secreti |issue=7 |pages=3394–3398 |url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/87/7/3394 |accessdate=2007-07-03 |quote=Decreased libido is frequently reported in male patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). |pmid=12107256 |doi=10.1210/jc.87.7.3394 |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism |volume=87}}</ref> It has also been suggested that it can cause significant psychological and social damage to sufferers.<ref>{{cite news |date=1999-01-12 |title=The effect of surgery upon the quality of life in snoring patients and their partners: a between-subjects case-controlled trial |publisher=M.W.J.

Though snoring is often considered a minor affliction, snorers can sometimes suffer severe impairment of lifestyle. The between-subjects trial by Armstrong et al. discovered a statistically significant improvement in marital relations after snoring was surgically corrected. This was confirmed by evidence from Gall et al.,<ref>{{cite news |year=1993 |title= Quality of life in mild obstructive sleep apnea |publisher=Gall, R., Isaac, L., Kryger, M. (1993) Sleep, 16, S59 S61}}</ref> Cartwright and Knight<ref>{{cite news |year=1987 |title= Silent partners: the wives of sleep apneic patients |publisher=Cartwright, R.D. & Knight, S.

New studies associate loud "snoring" with the development of carotid artery atherosclerosis,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=SA |coauthors=TC Amis, K Byth, G Larcos, K Kairaitis, TD Robinson, JR Wheatley |title=Heavy snoring as a cause of carotid artery atherosclerosis |journal=Sleep |volume=31 |pages=1207–1213 |date=September 2008 |publisher=Asoociated Professional Sleep Societies |issn=0161-8105 |accessdate=2009-02-01 |pmid=18788645 |issue=9 |pmc=2542975}}</ref> the risk of brain damage<ref>{{cite news |title=Snoring linked to brain damage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/snoring-linked-to-brain-damage-20101022-16wxl.html |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=22 October 2010}}</ref> and of [[stroke]]. Researchers hypothesize that loud snoring creates turbulence in carotid artery blood flow closest to the airway. Generally speaking, increased turbulence irritates blood cells and has previously been implicated as a cause of [[atherosclerosis]].

A U.S. study estimates that roughly one in every 15 Americans is affected by at least a moderate degree of sleep apnea.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

==Prevalence==
Statistics on snoring are often contradictory, but at least 30% of adults and perhaps as many as 50% of people in some demographics snore.<ref>{{cite news |date=2001-09-19 |title=New Vaccine Could Cure Snoring (statistics insert) |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1552168.stm}}</ref> One survey of 5,713 Italian residents identified habitual snoring in 24% of men and 13.8% of women, rising to 60% of men and 40% of women aged 60 to 65 years; this suggests an increased susceptibility to snoring as age increases.<ref>{{cite news |title=Some epidemiological data on snoring and cardiocirculatory disturbances |publisher=Lugaresi E., Cirignotta F., Coccoagna G. et al.

==Treatment==
Almost all treatments for snoring revolve around clearing the blockage in the breathing passage. This is the reason snorers are advised to [[lose weight]] (to stop fat from pressing on the throat), stop [[smoking]] (smoking weakens and clogs the throat) and sleep on their side (to prevent the tongue from blocking the throat).<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC Health website: snoring |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/snoring1.shtml}}</ref>  A number of other treatment options are also available, ranging from over-the-counter aids such as nasal sprays, [[nasal strips]] or nose clips, lubricating sprays, and "anti-snore" clothing and pillows, to such unusual activities as playing the [[didgeridoo]].<ref>{{cite news |date=2005-12-23 |title=Didgeridoo playing as alternative treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome |publisher=British Medical Journal |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/reprint/332/7536/266.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

===Dental appliances===
[[File:Avance_mandibular.jpg|thumb|One style of mandibular advancement splint]]

Specially made dental appliances called [[mandibular advancement splint]]s, which advance the lower jaw slightly and thereby pull the tongue forward, are a common mode of treatment for snoring. Such appliances have been proven to be effective in reducing snoring and [[sleep apnea]] in cases where the [[apnea]] is mild to moderate.<ref name="AM J RESPIR CRIT CARE MED">[http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/content/161/2/420.full.pdf],  Henke,Frantz AM J RESPIR CRIT CARE MED 2000;161:420–425.</ref> Mandibular advancement splints are often tolerated much better than [[Continuous positive airway pressure|CPAP]] machines.<ref>"Comparative Study of Oral Devices for Snoring" [http://www.cda.org/Library/cda_member/pubs/journal/jour898/devices.html], Journal of the California Assoc. Aug. 1998</ref>

Over-the-counter mandibular advancement splints are usually made from an EVA polymer and most are similar in appearance to protective mouth-guards worn for sports. Professionally fitted devices are intended to set the correct jaw position. An over-advanced jaw results in jaw joint pain, while an under-advanced jaw produces no therapeutic effect. The professionally fitted devices generally incorporate an adjustment mechanism so that jaw advancement can be easily increased or decreased after fitting. To adjust most "do it yourself" appliances it is necessary to reheat them and mold them again in the desired new position. Alternatively, given the low cost, a new splint can be used.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

Previously in the United States, mandibular advancement splints were considered to be class 2 medical devices and could not be legally sold without a prescription. Americans were, however, allowed to purchase these devices outside the United States and import them for personal use. In Australia, manufacturers can obtain approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) allowing the devices to be sold via normal retail channels without the involvement of a doctor.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

===Positive airway pressure===
{{Main|Positive airway pressure}}
A continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine is often used to control sleep apnea and the snoring associated with it. To keep the airway open, a device pumps a controlled stream of air through a flexible hose to a mask worn over the nose, mouth, or both.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.entnet.org/healthinfo/snoring/cpap.cfm |title=Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) |accessdate=2007-07-02 |publisher=American Academy of Otolaryngology−Head and Neck Surgery}}</ref>

===Surgery===
Surgery is also available as a method of correcting social snoring. Some procedures, such as [[uvulopalatopharyngoplasty]], attempt to widen the airway by removing tissues in the back of the throat, including the [[uvula]] and [[pharynx]]. These surgeries are quite invasive, however, and there are risks of adverse side effects. The most dangerous risk is that enough scar tissue could form within the throat as a result of the incisions to make the airway more narrow than it was prior to surgery, diminishing the airspace in the velopharynx. Scarring is an individual trait, so it is difficult for a surgeon to predict how much a person might be predisposed to scarring. Currently, the [[American Medical Association]] does not approve of the use of lasers to perform operations on the pharynx or uvula.

[[Radiofrequency ablation]] (RFA) is a relatively new surgical treatment for snoring. This treatment applies radiofrequency energy and heat (between 77 °C and 85 °C) to the soft tissue at the back of the throat, such as the soft palate and uvula, causing scarring of the tissue beneath the skin. After healing, this results in stiffening of the treated area. The procedure takes less than one hour, is usually performed on an outpatient basis, and usually requires several treatment sessions. Radiofrequency ablation is frequently effective in reducing the severity of snoring, but, often does not completely eliminate snoring.<ref>[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/1998/may20/snoring520.html Snoring subdued with new treatment: 5/20/98<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nice.org.uk/ipcat.aspx?c=212220 Radiofrequency ablation of the soft palate for snoring<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref>

[[Bipolar radiofrequency ablation]], a technique used for [[coblation tonsillectomy]], is also used for the treatment of snoring.

===The Pillar Procedure===
The Pillar Procedure is a minimally invasive treatment for snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. This procedure was FDA indicated in 2004.  During this procedure, three to six+ dacron (the material used in permanent sutures) strips are inserted into the soft palate, using a modified syringe and local anesthetic. While the procedure was initially approved for the insertion of three "pillars" into the soft palate, it was found that there was a significant dosage response to more pillars, with appropriate candidates.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} As a result of this outpatient operation, which typically lasts no more than 30 minutes, the soft palate is more rigid, possibly reducing instances of sleep apnea and snoring.  This procedure addresses one of the most common causes of snoring and sleep apnea — vibration or collapse of the soft palate (the soft part of the roof of the mouth).  If there are other factors contributing to snoring or sleep apnea, such as conditions of the nasal airway or an enlarged tongue, it will likely need to be combined with other treatments to be more effective.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

===Pharmacological treatment===
An open label non-randomized study in 30 patients found benefit from [[pseudoephedrine]], [[domperidone]], and the combination in the treatment of severe snoring.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faronkal.cl/deploy/Treatment_of_severe_snoring_with_a_combination.pdf |title=Treatment of Severe Snoring with a Combination of Pseudoephedrine Sulfate and Domperidone.  |accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref>

===Natural remedies===
There are various natural methods alleged to alleviate snoring. These can be in the form of herbal pills, acupressure devices or specialized [[acupuncture]].

There are occasions wherein snoring is the result of a wrong sleeping position. Sleeping with too many pillows can stretch and narrow the air passage. Use one pillow to avoid it. Also, lying on the back can cause snoring. So, a change in sleeping position can be a help.

All-natural anti-snoring sprays are also available, as over-the-counter products available at pharmacies.

Among the 'natural' remedies are exercises to increase the muscle tone of the upper airway,<ref name=PaiEtal2008>{{Cite journal |year=2008 |author=Pai, Irumee |author2=Lo, Stephen |author3=Wolf, Dennis |author4=ajieker, Azgher |pmid=18183444 |title=The effect of singing on snoring and daytime somnolence |journal=Sleep and Breathing |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=265–268 | doi=10.1007/s11325-007-0159-1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r771q473w2p108r6/ |accessdate=9 January 2011 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.
