The '''substantia nigra''' is a brain structure located in the [[mesencephalon]] (midbrain) that plays an important role in [[reward (psychology)|reward]], [[Substance use disorder|addiction]], and [[Motor system|movement]]. ''Substantia nigra'' is [[Latin]] for "black substance", reflecting the fact that parts of the substantia nigra appear darker than neighboring areas due to high levels of [[melanin]] in [[dopamine]]rgic [[neuron]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Parkinson's disease]] is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the  substantia nigra [[pars compacta]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Se Jung|coauthors=J.Y.

Although the substantia nigra appears as a continuous band in brain sections, anatomical studies have found that it actually consists of two parts with very different connections and functions: the pars compacta and pars reticulata. The pars compacta serves mainly as an input to the basal ganglia circuit, supplying the [[striatum]] with dopamine. The pars reticulata, on the other hand, serves mainly as an output, conveying signals from the basal ganglia to numerous other brain structures.

{{See also|Primate basal ganglia system}}
The substantia nigra, along with four other nuclei, is part of the [[basal ganglia]]. It is the largest [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nucleus]] in the midbrain, lying dorsal to the [[cerebral peduncles]]. Humans have two substantiae nigrae, one on each side of the midline. 

The substantia nigra is divided into two parts: the pars reticulata and pars compacta, which lies medial to the pars reticulata. Sometimes a third region, the pars lateralis, is mentioned, though its is usually classified as part of the pars reticulata. The pars reticulata and the internal [[globus pallidus]] are separated by the [[internal capsule]].

===Pars reticulata===
{{Main|Pars reticulata}}
The pars reticulata bears a strong resemblance, both structurally and functionally, to the internal part of the globus pallidus. The two are sometimes considered parts of the same structure, separated by the white matter of the internal capsule. Like those of the globus pallidus, the neurons in pars reticulata are mainly [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABAergic]].

====Afferent connections====
The main input to the pars reticulata derives from the [[striatum]]. It comes by two routes, known as the ''direct'' and ''indirect'' pathways. The direct pathway consists of axons from medium spiny cells in the striatum that project directly to pars reticulata. The indirect pathway consists of three links: a projection from striatal medium spiny cells to the external part of the [[globus pallidus]]; a [[GABAergic]] projection from the globus pallidus to the [[subthalamic nucleus]], and a [[glutamatergic]] projection from the globus pallidus to the pars reticulata.<ref>{{cite journal

</ref>{{better source|date=November 2012}} Thus, striatal activity via the direct pathway exerts an inhibitory effect on neurons in the pars reticulata, but an excitatory effect via the indirect pathway. The direct and indirect pathways originate from different subsets of striatal medium spiny cells: they are tightly intermingled but express different types of dopamine receptors, as well as showing other neurochemical differences.

====Efferent connections====
There are significant projections to the thalamus (ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei), superior colliculus, and other caudal nuclei from the pars reticulata (the nigrothalamic pathway).,<ref>{{cite journal

==Function==
The substantia nigra is an important player in brain function, in particular, in [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]], [[motor planning]], [[reward systems|reward-seeking]], [[learning]], and addiction. Many of the substantia nigra's effects are mediated through the [[striatum]]. The nigral [[dopaminergic]] input to the striatum via the [[nigrostriatal pathway]] is intimately linked with the striatum's function.<ref name = "striatum">{{cite journal |title=Dopaminergic modulation of neuronal excitability in the striatum and [[nucleus accumbens]] |pmid=10845063 |author=Nicola, S M; Surmeier, J; Malenka, R C |journal=Annu Rev Neurosci |volume=23 |pages=185–215 |year=2000 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.185}}</ref> The co-dependence between the striatum and substantia nigra can be seen in this way: when the substantia nigra is electrically stimulated, no movement occurs; however, the symptoms of nigral degeneration due to Parkinson's is a poignant example of the substantia nigra's influence on movement. In addition to striatum-mediated functions, the substantia nigra also serves as a major source of [[GABAergic]] inhibition to various brain targets.

===Pars reticulata===
{{main|Pars_reticulata#Function}}
The [[pars reticulata]] of the substantia nigra is an important processing center in the [[basal ganglia]]. The GABAergic neurons in the pars reticulata convey the final processed signals of the [[basal ganglia]] to the [[thalamus]] and [[superior colliculus]]. In addition, the pars reticulata also inhibits dopaminergic activity in the [[pars compacta]] via axon collaterals, although the functional organization of these connections remains unclear.

The GABAergic neurons of the pars reticulata spontaneously fire [[action potential]]s. In rats, the frequency of action potentials is roughly 25&nbsp;Hz.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Subregional changes in discharge rate, pattern, and drug sensitivity of putative GABAergic nigral neurons in the kindling model of epilepsy. |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118791634/abstract |author=Gernert, Manuela; Fedrowitz, Maren; Wlaz, Piotr; Loscher, Wolfgang |journal=Eur J Neurosci  |volume=20 |issue=9 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03699.x |pages=2377–86 |pmid=15525279}}</ref> The purpose of these spontaneous action potentials is to inhibit targets of the basal ganglia, and decreases in inhibition are associated with movement.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Role of primate substantia nigra pars reticulata in reward-oriented saccadic eye movement. |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/22/6/2363 |author=Sato, Makoto; Hikosaka, Okihide |journal=J Neurosci  |volume=22 |issue=6 |date= March 15, 2002 |pmid=11896175 |pages=2363–73 }}</ref> The subthalamic nucleus gives excitatory input that modulates the rate of firing of these spontaneous action potentials.

===Pars compacta===
{{main|Pars_compacta#Function}}
The most prominent function of the pars compacta is [[motor control]],<ref>{{cite journal |title=Pars compacta of the substantia nigra modulates motor activity but is not involved importantly in regulating food and water intake. |pmid=7207636 |author=Hodge, G K; Butcher, L L |year=1980 |journal=Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol   |volume=313 |issue=1 |pages=51–67 |doi=10.1007/BF00505805  }}</ref> though the substantia nigra's role in motor control is indirect; electrical stimulation of the substantia nigra does not result in movement, due to mediation of the striatum in the nigral influence of movement. However, lack of pars compacta neurons has a large influence on movement, as evidenced by the symptoms of Parkinson's. The motor role of the pars compacta may involve fine motor control, as has been confirmed in animal models with lesions in that region.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Differential behavioral effects of partial bilateral lesions of ventral tegmental area or substantia nigra pars compacta in rats. |pmid=18455318 |journal=Neuroscience |year=2008 |author=Pioli, E Y; Meissner, W; Sohr, R; Gross, C E; Bezard, E; Bioulac, B H |volume=153 |issue=4 |pages=1213–24 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.01.084 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The substantia nigra is critical in the development of many diseases, including [[Parkinson's disease]].

===Parkinson's disease===
[[File:Substantia nigra with Lewy body pathology.svg|300px|right|thumb|Substantia nigra with loss of  cells and Lewy body pathology]]
{{Main|Parkinson's disease}}
Parkinson's disease is a [[neurodegenerative disease]] characterized, in part, by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. The major symptoms of Parkinson's disease include [[tremor]], [[akinesia]], [[bradykinesia]], and stiffness.<ref name=Jankovic2008>{{cite journal |author=Jankovic J |title=Parkinson's disease: clinical features and diagnosis |journal=J.

The cause of death of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta is unknown. However, some contributions to the unique susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta have been identified. For one, dopaminergic neurons show abnormalities in [[Electron_transport_chain#Complex_I|mitochondrial complex 1]], causing aggregation of [[alpha-synuclein]]; this can result in abnormal protein handling and neuron death.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Molecular Pathways of Neurodegeneration in Parkinson's Disease |author=Dawson, T; Dawson, V |journal=Science |volume=302 |issue=5646 |url=http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;302/5646/819 |pages=819–22 |doi=10.1126/science.1087753 |year=2003 |pmid=14593166|bibcode = 2003Sci...302..819D }}</ref> Secondly, dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta contain less calbindin than other dopaminergic neurons.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the mouse that contain calbindin-D28k exhibit reduced vulnerability to MPTP-induced neurodegeneration |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WNN-45R7746-4&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=36e04c22d8554f3e63ceabdfa1109161 |author=Liang CL, Sinton CM, Sonsalla PK, German DC |year=1996 |volume=5 |journal=Neurodegeneration |pages=313–8 |doi=10.1006/neur.1996.0042 |pmid=9117542 |issue=4}}</ref> [[Calbindin]] is a protein involved in [[calcium]] ion transport within cells, and excess calcium in cells is toxic.

Yoland Smith, PhD</ref> Most of this plasticity occurs at the neurochemical level; dopamine transport systems are slowed, allowing dopamine to linger for longer periods of time in the chemical synapses in the striatum.<ref  name ="interview" />

===Schizophrenia===
{{See also|Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia}}
Increased levels of dopamine have long been implicated in the development of [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Rossum, J |year=1967 |editor=Brill H, Cole J, Deniker P, Hippius H, Bradley P B |pages=321–9 |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology, Proceedings Fifth Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum}}</ref> However, much debate continues to this day surrounding this theory, which is commonly known as the [[dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]]. Despite the controversy, dopamine antagonists remain a standard and successful treatment for schizophrenia. These antagonists include [[typical antipsychotic|first generation (typical) antipsychotics]] such as [[butyrophenones]], [[phenothiazines]], and [[thioxanthenes]]. These drugs have largely been replaced by [[atypical antipsychotic|second generation (atypical) antipsychotics]] such as [[clozapine]] and [[paliperidone]]. It should be noted that these drugs generally do not act on dopamine-producing neurons themselves, but on the receptors on the post-synaptic neuron.

Other, non-pharmacological evidence in support of the dopamine hypothesis relating to the substantia nigra include structural changes in the pars compacta, such as reduction in synaptic terminal size.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Synaptic contacts in schizophrenia: Studies using immunocytochemical identification of dopaminergic neurons |author=N. S. Kolomeets and N. A. Uranova |journal=Neuroscience and Behavioral Physiology |year=1997 |pages=217–21 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/tk1265586511t6ww/}}</ref> Other changes in the substantia nigra include increased expression of [[NMDA receptor]]s in the substantia nigra, and reduced [[dysbindin]] expression. Increased NMDA receptors may point to the involvement of [[glutamate]]-[[dopamine]] interactions in schizophrenia. Dysbindin, which has been (controversially) linked to schizophrenia, may regulate dopamine release, and low expression of dysbindin in the substantia nigra may be important in schizophrenia etiology.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Hyperactivation of midbrain dopaminergic system in schizophrenia could be attributed to the down-regulation of dysbindin |pmid=16701550 |year=2006 |journal=Biochem Biophys Res Commun |volume=345 |issue=2 |pages=904–9 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.04.163 |author=Kumamoto, N |last2=Matsuzaki |first2=S |last3=Inoue |first3=K |last4=Hattori |first4=T |last5=Shimizu |first5=S |last6=Hashimoto |first6=R |last7=Yamatodani |first7=A |last8=Katayama |first8=T |last9=Tohyama |first9=M }}</ref> Due to the changes to the substantia nigra in the schizophrenic brain, it may eventually be possible to use specific imaging techniques (such as melanin-specific imaging) to detect physiological signs of schizophrenia in the substantia nigra.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Use of neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to distinguish schizophrenic and depressive patients and healthy individuals based on signal alterations in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus |pmid=18452894 |year=2008 |author=Shibata, Eri; Sasaki, Makoto; Tohyama, Koujiro; Otsuka, Kotaro; Endoh, Jin; Terayama, Yasuo; Sakai, Akio |issue=5 |volume=64 |journal=Biol Psychiatry |pages=401–6 |doi=10.1016/j. biopsych.2008.03.021 }}</ref>

==Chemical modification of the substantia nigra==
Chemical manipulation and modification of the substantia nigra is important in the fields of [[neuropharmacology]] and [[toxicology]]. Various compounds such as levodopa and MPTP are used in the treatment and study of Parkinson's disease, and many other drugs have effects on the substantia nigra.

===Levodopa===
{{See also|Levodopa}}
The substantia nigra is the target of chemical therapeutics for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. [[Levodopa]] (commonly referred to as L-DOPA), the dopamine precursor, is the most commonly prescribed medication for Parkinson's disease. Despite controversy concerning the neurotoxicity of dopamine and L-DOPA,<ref name="pmid9017256">{{cite journal |author=Cheng N, Maeda T, Kume T, et al. |pmid=9017256 |journal=Brain Research |volume=743 |issue=1–2 |pages=278–83 |year=1996 |month=December |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(96)01056-6 |title=Differential neurotoxicity induced by ?-DOPA and dopamine in cultured striatal neurons}}</ref> it remains the most common treatment for Parkinson's disease. The drug is especially effective in treating patients in the early stages of Parkinson's, although the drug does lose its efficacy over time.<ref>{{cite journal

  | doi =  10.1002/ana.10513}}</ref> Levodopa can cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and increases dopamine levels in the substantia nigra, thus alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The drawback of levodopa treatment is that it treats the symptoms of Parkinson's (low dopamine levels), rather than the cause (the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra).

===MPTP===
{{See also|MPTP}}
[[MPTP]], is a neurotoxin specific to dopaminergic cells in the brain, specifically in the substantia nigra. MPTP was brought to the spotlight in 1982 when heroin users in California displayed Parkinson's-like symptoms after using [[MPPP]] contaminated with MPTP. The patients, who were rigid and almost completely immobile, responded to levodopa treatment. No remission of the Parkinson's-like symptoms was reported, suggesting irreversible death of the dopaminergic neurons.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Chronic Parkinsonism in humans due to a product of meperidine-analog synthesis |journal=Science |author=JW Langston, P Ballard, JW Tetrud, and I Irwin |volume=219 |issue=4587 |pages=979–80 |year=1983 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/219/4587/979 |doi=10.1126/science.6823561 |pmid=6823561|bibcode = 1983Sci...219..979L }}</ref> The proposed mechanism of MPTP involves disruption of [[mitochondria]]l function, including disruption of [[metabolism]] and creation of [[free radical]]s.<ref name = "MPTP">{{cite journal |title=Neurochemical findings in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease |author=Schmidt, N; Ferger, B |journal=J Neural Transm   |volume=108 |issue=11 |pages=1263–82 |year=2001 |doi=10.1007/s007020100004 |pmid=11768626}}</ref>

Soon after, MPTP was tested in animal models for its efficacy in inducing Parkinson's disease (with success). MPTP induced akinesia, rigidity, and tremor in primates, and its neurotoxicity was found to be very specific to the substantia nigra pars compacta.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Selective nigral toxicity after systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyrine (MPTP) in the squirrel monkey |pmid=6607092 |author=Langston, J W; Forno, L S; Rebert, C S; Irwin, I |journal=Brain Res |volume=292 |issue=2 |pages=390–4 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(84)90777-7 |year=1984}}</ref> In other animals, such as rodents, the induction of Parkinson's by MPTP is incomplete or requires much higher and frequent doses than in primates. Today, MPTP remains the most favored model for studying Parkinson's.<ref name = "MPTP" />

===Cocaine===
{{See also|Cocaine}}
[[Cocaine]]'s mechanism of action in the human brain includes the inhibition of dopamine reuptake,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heikkila, R E; Cabbat, F S; Duvoisin, R C |title=Motor activity and rotational behavior after analogs of cocaine: correlation with dopamine uptake blockade |pmid=575770 |journal=Commun Psychopharmacol   |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=285–90 |year=1979}}</ref> which accounts for cocaine's addictive properties, as dopamine is the critical neurotransmitter for reward. However, cocaine is more active in the dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area than the substantia nigra. Cocaine administration increases metabolism in the substantia nigra, which can explain the altered motor function seen in cocaine-using subjects.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cocaine |author=Joan M. Lakoski, Matthew P. Galloway, Francis J. White |publisher=Telford Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-8493-8813-9}}</ref> The inhibition of dopamine reuptake by cocaine also inhibits the firing of spontaneous action potentials by the pars compacta.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Actions of cocaine on rat dopaminergic neurones in vitro |author=M.

North |journal=Br J Pharmacol |pmc=1917549 |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=731–5 |year=1990 |pmid=2361170}}</ref> The mechanism by which cocaine inhibits dopamine reuptake involves its binding to the [[dopamine transporter]] protein. However, recent studies show that cocaine can also cause a decrease in DAT [[mRNA]] levels,<ref name = "coke">{{cite journal |title=Quantitation of Rat Dopamine Transporter mRNA: Effects of Cocaine Treatment and Withdrawal |author=Yue Xia, Dennis J.

Inactivation of the substantia nigra could prove to be a possible treatment for cocaine addiction. In a study of cocaine-dependent rats, inactivation of the substantia nigra via implanted [[cannulae]] greatly reduced cocaine addiction relapse.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The role of dorsal vs ventral striatal pathways in cocaine-seeking behavior after prolonged abstinence in rats |pmid=17589830 |author=See, R E; Elliott, J C; Feltenstein, M W |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl) |volume=194 |issue=3 |pages=321–31 |year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s00213-007-0850-8}}</ref>

===Amphetamines===
{{See also|Amphetamines}}
Like cocaine, [[amphetamine]] increases the concentrations of [[dopamine]] in the [[synaptic cleft]], thereby heightening the response of the post-synaptic neuron.<ref name="Kuczenski">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.1997.68052032.x |author=Kuczenski, R and Segal, D. |title=Effects of methylphenidate on extracellular dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine; Comparison with amphetamine |url= |journal=J  Neurochem |volume=68 |year=1997 |pages=2032–7 |pmid=9109529 |issue=5}}</ref> Also like cocaine, the altered dopamine function contributes to the addictiveness of amphetamines.

The mechanism by which amphetamines increase synaptic levels of dopamine is to release dopamine from pre-synaptic [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicles]], increasing concentrations of [[dopamine]] in the [[cytosol]] of the pre-synaptic neuron.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rothman, R; Baumann, M. |title=Balance between dopamine and serotonin release modulates behavioral effects of amphetamine-type drugs |pmid=17105921 |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci |issue=  |year=2006 |pages=245–60 |volume=1074 |doi=10.1196/annals.1369.064 |bibcode=2006NYASA1074..245R}}</ref> The high concentration of dopamine in the pre-synaptic terminal causes the reverse transport of dopamine through the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT) and into the synaptic cleft.<ref name="Regulation">{{cite journal |author=Johnson, L’Aurelle A. et al. |title=Regulation of amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux by Protein Kinase C-beta |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/abstract/M413887200v1 |journal=J.
