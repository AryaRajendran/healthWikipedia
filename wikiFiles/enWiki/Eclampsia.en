'''Eclampsia''' (Greek, "shining forth") is an acute and  life-threatening  complication of [[pregnancy]], characterized by the appearance of [[tonic-clonic seizure]]s, usually in a patient who has developed  [[pre-eclampsia]]. (Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are collectively called ''Hypertensive disorder of pregnancy'' and ''toxemia of pregnancy''.)

Eclampsia includes seizures and coma that happen during pregnancy but are not due to preexisting or organic brain disorders.<ref name=Chesley>{{cite book |author=Chesley LC |chapter=Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy |title=Williams Obstetrics |edition=14th | publisher=Appleton Century Crofts |location=New York |year=1971 |page=700}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Typically patients show signs of  [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] and [[proteinuria]] before the onset of the hallmark of eclampsia, the  eclamptic convulsion. Other cerebral signs may precede the convulsion such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, and [[cortical blindness]]. In addition, with the advancement of the pathophysiological process, other organ symptoms may be present including abdominal pain, liver failure, signs of the [[HELLP syndrome]], [[pulmonary edema]], and [[oliguria]]. The fetus may already have been compromised by [[intrauterine growth retardation]], and with the toxemic changes during eclampsia may suffer [[fetal distress]]. Placental bleeding and [[placental abruption]] may occur.

===Seizures===
Chesley<ref>Chesley, ibid. page 702</ref> distinguishes these four stages of an eclamptic event: 
# in the ''stage of invasion'' facial twitching can be observed around the mouth.
# in the ''stage of contraction'' [[Tonic contraction|tonic contractions]], or sustained muscular contractions without intervals of relaxation, render the body rigid; this stage may last about 15 to 20 seconds. (Tonic contractions are also known as [[tetanic contractions]]).
# the next stage is the ''stage of convulsion'' when involuntary and forceful muscular movements occur, the tongue may be bitten, foam appears at the mouth. The patient stops breathing and becomes [[cyanosis|cyanotic]]; this stage lasts about one minute. 
# the final stage is a more or less prolonged ''[[coma]]''. When the patient awakens, she is unlikely to remember the event.

In some rare cases there are no convulsions and the patient falls directly into a coma. Some patients may experience temporary blindness upon waking from the coma.

During a seizure, the fetus may experience [[bradycardia]].<ref name=ACOG/>

==Risk factors==
Eclampsia, like preeclampsia, tends to occur more commonly in first pregnancies and young mothers where it is thought that novel exposure to paternal [[antigen]]s is involved. Furthermore, women with preexisting vascular diseases ([[hypertension]], [[diabetes]], and [[nephropathy]]) or thrombophilic diseases such as the [[antiphospholipid syndrome]] are at higher risk to develop preeclampsia and eclampsia. Having a large placenta ([[multiple gestation]], [[hydatidiform mole]]) also predisposes women to toxemia.  In addition, there is a genetic component: patients whose mother or sister had the condition are at higher risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chesley LC, Annitto JE, Cosgrove RA |title=The familial factor in toxemia of pregnancy |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=303–11 |year=1968 |month=September |pmid=5742111 }}</ref> Patients who have experienced eclampsia are at increased risk for preeclampsia/eclampsia in a later pregnancy.

==Pathophysiology==
While multiple theories have been proposed to explain preeclampsia  and eclampsia, it occurs only in the presence of a [[placenta]] and is resolved by its removal.<ref name=lancet/> Placental [[hypoperfusion]] is a key feature of the process. It is accompanied by increased sensitivity of the maternal vasculature to pressor agents leading to vasospasm and hypoperfusion of multiple organs. Further, an activation of the [[coagulation]] cascade leads to [[Thrombus|microthrombi]] formation and aggravates the perfusion problem. Loss of plasma from the vascular tree with the resulting [[oedema|edema]] additionally compromises the situation. These events lead to signs and symptoms of toxemia including hypertension, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic dysfunction, and—in eclampsia, specifically—cerebral dysfunction.<ref name=lancet>{{cite journal |author=Roberts JM, Cooper DW |title=Pathogenesis and genetics of pre-eclampsia |journal=Lancet |volume=357 |issue=9249 |pages=53–6 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11197372 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673600035777}}</ref> Preclinical markers of the disease process are signs of increased platelet and [[endothelial activation]].<ref name=lancet/>

Placental hypoperfusion is linked to  abnormal modelling of the fetal-maternal interface that may be immunologically mediated.<ref name=lancet/>  The invasion of the trophoblast appears to be incomplete.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhou Y, Fisher SJ, Janatpour M, ''et al.'' |title=Human cytotrophoblasts adopt a vascular phenotype as they differentiate.

[[Adrenomedullin]], a potent vasodilator, is produced in diminished quantities by the placenta in preeclampsia (and thus eclampsia).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li H, Dakour J, Kaufman S, Guilbert LJ, Winkler-Lowen B, Morrish DW |title=Adrenomedullin is decreased in preeclampsia because of failed response to epidermal growth factor and impaired syncytialization |journal=Hypertension |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=895–900 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14517225 |doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000095613.41961.6E |url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14517225}}</ref> Other vasoactive agents are at play including [[prostacyclin]], [[thromboxane]] A2, [[nitric oxide]], and [[endothelin]]s leading to vasoconstriction.<ref name=ACOG/> Many studies have suggested the importance of a woman's [[immunological tolerance]] to her baby's father, whose genes are present in the young fetus and its placenta and which may pose a challenge to her immune system.<ref name="Sex Primes Women for Sperm">{{cite news | title=Sex Primes Women for Sperm | publisher=BBC News | date=6 February 2002 | accessdate=2007-11-19 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1803978.stm}}</ref>

Eclampsia is seen as a form of [[hypertensive encephalopathy]] in the context of those pathological events that lead to preeclampsia. It is thought that cerebral [[vascular resistance]] is reduced, leading to increased blood flow to the brain. In addition to abnormal function of the [[endothelium]], this leads to [[cerebral oedema]].<ref name="Cipolla">{{cite journal | author=Cipolla MJ | title=Cerebrovascular function in pregnancy and eclampsia | journal=Hypertension | volume=50 | issue=1 | pages=14–24 | month=July | year=2007 | url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/1/14 | pmid=17548723 | doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.106.079442 }}</ref> Typically an eclamptic seizure will not lead to lasting brain damage; however, intracranial haemorrhage may occur.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richards A, Graham D, Bullock R |title=Clinicopathological study of neurological complications due to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy |journal=J.

==Diagnosis==
Seizures during pregnancy that are unrelated to preeclampsia need to be distinguished from eclampsia. Such disorders include seizure disorders as well as brain tumor, [[aneurysm]] of the brain, and medication- or drug-related seizures. Usually the presence of the signs of severe preeclampsia precede and accompany eclampsia, facilitating the diagnosis.

Investigations: [[Complete blood count|CBC]], [[Renal function test]] (RFT), [[Liver function test]] (LFT), [[coagulation screen]], plasma rate concentration, 24 hour urine analysis, [[ultrasound]].

==Prevention==
Detection and management of preeclampsia is critical to reduce the risk of eclampsia. Appropriate management of patients with preeclampsia generally involves the use of [[magnesium sulphate]] as an agent to prevent convulsions, and thus preventing eclampsia.

==Treatment==
The treatment of eclampsia requires prompt intervention and aims to prevent further convulsions, control the elevated blood pressure, and immediately terminate the pregnancy—by delivery of the baby if possible.

===Prevention of convulsions===
Prevention of [[seizure]] [[convulsion]] is usually done using [[magnesium sulphate]].<ref name="Rozenberg-2006">{{Cite journal | last1 = Rozenberg | first1 = P. | title = [Magnesium sulphate for the management of preeclampsia] | journal = Gynecol Obstet Fertil | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–9 | month = Jan | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.gyobfe.2005.06.025 | pmid = 16406662 }}</ref> The idea to use {{chem|Mg|2+}} for the management of eclamptogenic [[toxemia]]{{dn|date=March 2013}} dates from before 1955 when it was tested and published—the serum {{chem|Mg|2+}} therapeutic range for the prevention of the eclampsic uterine contractions is still considered 4.0–7.0 mEq/L.<ref name="Pritchard">{{cite journal |author=Pritchard JA |title=The use of the magnesium ion in the management of eclamptogenic toxemias |journal=Surg Gynecol Obstet |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=131–40 |year=1955 |month=February |pmid=13238166 }}</ref> As per Lu and Nightingale,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lu JF, Nightingale CH |title=Magnesium sulfate in eclampsia and pre-eclampsia: pharmacokinetic principles |journal=Clin Pharmacokinet |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=305–14 |year=2000 |month=April |pmid=10803454 |url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?issn=0312-5963&volume=38&issue=4&spage=305}}</ref> serum {{chem|Mg|2+}} concentrations associated with maternal toxicity (also neonate depression or hypotonia and low [[Apgar score]]s) are:

*  7.0–10.0 mEq/L: loss of [[patellar reflex]]
* 10.0–13.0 mEq/L: respiratory depression
* 15.0–25.0 mEq/L: altered atrioventricular conduction and (further) complete [[heart block]]
*     >25.0 mEq/L: [[cardiac arrest]]

Even with therapeutic serum {{chem|Mg|2+}} concentrations, recurrent convulsions and seizures may occur—patients should receive additional {{chem|MgSO|4}} but with close monitoring for respiratory, cardiac, and neurological depression. The treat dosage is 4–6 g loading dose in 100 mL IV fluid over 15–20 min. then 2 g/hr as a continuous infusion.<ref name=ACOG/> If high {{chem|Mg|2+}} concentrations fail to take effect, IV [[anticonvulsants]] will ease patient intubation and mechanical ventilation as adjuvants against the eclamptic convulsions (plus the hypermagnesemic thoracic muscle [[paralysis]]). The international MAGPIE study, of 2004, evaluated the long-term implications of the [[magnesium sulphate]] therapies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frayling, Frayling |title=The Magpie Trial follow up study: outcome after discharge from hospital for women and children recruited to a trial comparing magnesium sulphate with placebo for pre-eclampsia [ISRCTN86938761] |journal= BMC pregnancy and childbirth|volume=4 |pages=5 |year=2004 |pmid=15113445 |author2=The Magpie Trial Follow Up Study Collaborative Group |doi=10.1186/1471-2393-4-5 |pmc=416479}}</ref>

===Antihypertensive management===
Antihypertensive management at this stage in pregnancy may consist of hydralazine (5–10&nbsp;mg IV every 15–20 min until desired response is achieved) or labetalol (20&nbsp;mg bolus IV followed by 40&nbsp;mg if necessary in 10 minutes; then 80&nbsp;mg every 10 minutes up to a maximum of 220&nbsp;mg).<ref name=ACOG>{{cite journal |title=ACOG practice bulletin. Diagnosis and management of preeclampsia and eclampsia. Number 33, January 2002 |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=159–67 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=16175681 }}</ref>

===Delivery===
If the baby has not yet been delivered, steps need to be taken to stabilize the patient and deliver her speedily. This needs to be done even if the fetus is immature, as the eclamptic condition is unsafe for both fetus and mother. As eclampsia is  a manifestation of a multiorgan failure, other organs (liver, kidney, lungs, cardiovascular system, and coagulation system) need to be assessed in preparation for a delivery (often  a [[caesarean section]]), unless the patient is already in advanced labor. Regional anesthesia for cesarean section is contraindicated when a [[coagulopathy]] has developed.

===Invasive haemodynamic monitoring===
Invasive haemodynamic monitoring may be useful in eclamptic patients with severe cardiac disease, renal disease, refractory hypertension, pulmonary oedema, and oliguria.<ref name=ACOG/>
