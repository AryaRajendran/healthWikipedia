A '''Registered Respiratory Therapist''' ('''RRT''') is a certification for [[respiratory practitioner]]s.  In the [[United States]] the certificate for the RRT is issued by the [[National Board for Respiratory Care]] after passing the [[NBRC-WRE]] and [[NBRC-CSE]] examinations.<ref name="pmid21276324">{{cite journal| author=Barnes TA, Kacmarek RM, Kageler WV, Morris MJ, Durbin CG| title=Transitioning the respiratory therapy workforce for 2015 and beyond. | journal=Respir Care | year= 2011 | volume= 56 | issue= 5 | pages= 681â€“90 | pmid=21276324 | doi=10.4187/respcare.01169 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=21276324  }}</ref>  Eligibility for the NBRC RRT examinations are both previously passing the entry-level examination for the certification of [[Certified Respiratory Therapist]], the [[NBRC-ELE]], and holding at least an [[Associate of Science in Respiratory Care]].  In [[Canada]] the RRT certification is granted by examination from the [[Canadian Society of Respiratory Therapists]].  Internationally [[respiratory care]] is governed by local governments and certification or license to practice as a respiratory practitioner is managed locally without the use of separate organizations as in the United States and Canada.
