'''Asperger syndrome''' ('''AS'''), also known as '''Asperger's syndrome''' or '''Asperger disorder''' ('''AD'''), is an [[autism spectrum]] disorder (ASD) that is characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. It differs from other autism spectrum disorders by its relative preservation of [[language development|linguistic]] and [[cognitive development]]. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and atypical (peculiar, odd) use of language are frequently reported.<ref name="McPartland"/><ref name="Baskin"/>

==Classification==
Asperger syndrome (AS) is one of the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are a [[spectrum disorder|spectrum of psychological conditions]] that are characterized by abnormalities of [[social interaction]] and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.<ref name=ICD-10-F84.0>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f840 |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-06-25 |title= International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems |edition= 10th ([[ICD-10]]) |author= World Health Organization |chapter= F84.

==Characteristics==
A [[pervasive developmental disorder]], Asperger syndrome is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language.<ref name=BehaveNet>{{cite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition= 4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author= American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter= Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder (AD) |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm |accessdate=2007-06-28 |publisher=<!-- pacify Citation bot --> |location=<!-- pacify Citation bot --> }}</ref> Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided [[verbosity]], restricted [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis.<ref name=Klin>{{cite journal |journal= Rev Bras Psiquiatr |year=2006 |volume=28 |issue= suppl 1 |pages=S3–S11 |title= Autism and Asperger syndrome: an overview |author= Klin A |doi=10.1590/S1516-44462006000500002 |pmid=16791390 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462006000500002&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref>

===Social interaction===
{{further2|[[Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_autism#Asperger_syndrome_and_interpersonal_relationships|Asperger syndrome and interpersonal relationships]]}}

A lack of demonstrated [[empathy]] has a significant impact on aspects of communal living for persons with Asperger syndrome.<ref name=Baskin/> Individuals with AS experience difficulties in basic elements of social interaction, which may include a failure to develop friendships or to seek shared enjoyments or achievements with others (for example, showing others objects of interest), a lack of social or emotional [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] (social "games" give-and-take mechanic), and impaired [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal behaviors]] in areas such as [[eye contact]], [[facial expression]], posture, and gesture.<ref name=McPartland>{{cite journal |author= McPartland J, Klin A |title= Asperger's syndrome |journal= Adolesc Med Clin |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=771–88 |year=2006 |pmid=17030291 |doi= 10.1016/j.admecli.2006.06.010}}</ref>

People with AS may not be as withdrawn around others compared to those with other, more debilitating, forms of [[autism]]; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a wish to change the topic of talk or end the interaction.<ref name=Klin/> This social awkwardness has been called "active but odd".<ref name=McPartland/> This failure to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings, and may come across as insensitive.<ref name=Klin/>  However, not all individuals with AS will approach others. Some of them may even display [[selective mutism]], speaking not at all to most people and excessively to specific people. Some may choose to talk to only people they like.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/912296-overview |work=Medscape eMedicine |title=Asperger's Syndrome |author=Brasic JR |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>

The cognitive ability of children with AS often allows them to articulate [[social norms]] in a laboratory context,<ref name=McPartland/> where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations.<ref name=Klin/> People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.<ref name=McPartland/>

The [[hypothesis]] that individuals with AS are predisposed to violent or criminal behavior has been investigated, but is not supported by data.<ref name="McPartland"/><ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2008 |title= Offending behaviour in adults with Asperger syndrome |author= Allen D, Evans C, Hider A, Hawkins S, Peckett H, Morgan H |pmid=17805955 |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0442-9 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=748–58}}</ref> More evidence suggests children with AS are victims rather than victimizers.<ref name=Tsatsanis>{{cite journal |journal= Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am |year=2003 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=47–63 |title=Outcome research in Asperger syndrome and autism |author= Tsatsanis KD |pmid=12512398 |url=http://www.childpsych.theclinics.com/article/PIIS1056499302000561/fulltext |doi=10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00056-1}}</ref> A 2008 review found that an overwhelming number of reported violent criminals with AS had coexisting [[psychiatric disorders]] such as [[schizoaffective disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Newman SS, Ghaziuddin M |title=Violent crime in Asperger syndrome: the role of psychiatric comorbidity |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=38 |issue=10 |pages=1848–52 |year=2008 |pmid=18449633 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0580-8}}</ref>

===Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior===
People with Asperger syndrome often display behavior, interests, and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines, move in [[Stereotypy|stereotyped]] and repetitive ways, or preoccupy themselves with parts of objects.<ref name=BehaveNet/>

Pursuit of specific and narrow areas of interest is one of the most striking features of AS.<ref name=McPartland/> Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic.<ref name=McPartland/><ref name=Klin/> For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography.<ref name=McPartland/> This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6.<ref name=McPartland/> Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.<ref name=Klin/>

Stereotyped and repetitive motor behaviors are a core part of the diagnosis of AS and other ASDs.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=145–58 |title= Repetitive behavior profiles in Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism |author= South M, Ozonoff S, McMahon WM |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-1992-8 |pmid=15909401}}</ref> They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements.<ref name=BehaveNet/> These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than [[tic]]s, which are usually faster, less rhythmical and less often symmetrical.<ref name=RapinTS>{{cite journal |author= Rapin I |title= Autism spectrum disorders: relevance to Tourette syndrome |journal= Adv Neurol |volume=85 |pages=89–101 |year=2001 |pmid=11530449}}</ref>

According to the Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA) diagnostic test, a lack of interest in fiction and a positive preference towards non-fiction is common among adults with AS.<ref name=ASAdulthood/>

===Speech and language===
Although individuals with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, [[language acquisition]] and use is often atypical.<ref name=Klin/> Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful to only the speaker, [[Auditory processing disorder|auditory perception deficits]], unusually pedantic, [[Register (sociolinguistics)|formal]] or [[Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry|idiosyncratic]] speech, and oddities in loudness, [[Tone (linguistics)|pitch]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and rhythm.<ref name=McPartland/>  [[Echolalia]] has also been observed in individuals with AS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frith U |title=Social communication and its disorder in autism and Asperger syndrome |journal=J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford) |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=48–53 |year=1996 |month=January |pmid=22302727 |doi=10.1177/026988119601000108}}</ref>

Three aspects of communication patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and [[circumstantial speech]], and marked verbosity. Although [[inflection]] and intonation may be less rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may convey a sense of [[Coherence (linguistics)|incoherence]]; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide [[Context (language use)|context]] for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to monitor whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.<ref name=Klin/>

Children with AS may have an unusually sophisticated vocabulary at a young age and have been colloquially called "little professors", but have difficulty understanding [[figurative language]] and tend to use language literally.<ref name=McPartland/> Children with AS appear to have particular weaknesses in areas of nonliteral language that include humor, irony, teasing, and sarcasm. Although individuals with AS usually understand the cognitive basis of [[humor]], they seem to lack understanding of the intent of humor to share enjoyment with others.<ref name=Kasari/> Despite strong evidence of impaired humor appreciation, anecdotal reports of humor in individuals with AS seem to challenge some psychological theories of AS and autism.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |title= Humor in autism and Asperger syndrome |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=521–31 |year=2004 |pmid=15628606 |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-2547-8}}</ref>

===Motor and sensory perception===
Individuals with Asperger syndrome may have signs or symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but can affect the individual or the family.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Filipek PA |title=The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=1999 |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=439–84 |doi=10.1023/A:1021943802493 |pmid=10638459 |author-separator=, |author2=Accardo PJ |author3=Baranek GT |display-authors=3 |last4=Cook |first4=Jr. |last5=Dawson |first5=Geraldine |last6=Gordon |first6=Barry |last7=Gravel |first7=Judith S. |last8=Johnson |first8=Chris P. |last9=Kallen |first9=Ronald J. }}</ref> These include differences in perception and problems with motor skills, sleep, and emotions.

Children with AS may be delayed in acquiring skills requiring motor dexterity, such as riding a bicycle or opening a jar, and may seem to move awkwardly or feel "uncomfortable in their own skin".

Hans Asperger described common symptoms among his patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome.

The children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy. Asperger called the condition "autistic psychopathy" and described it as primarily marked by [[social isolation]].<ref name=NINDS/> Fifty years later, several standardizations of AS as a [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] were tentatively proposed, many of which diverge significantly from Asperger's original work.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hippler K, Klicpera C |title=A retrospective analysis of the clinical case records of 'autistic psychopaths' diagnosed by Hans Asperger and his team at the University Children's Hospital, Vienna |journal=Philos.
