==Special Event Coverage==
New Orleans EMS, as the sole provider of 911 emergency medical services in the City of New Orleans, is responsible for the provision of medical care at several major events every year. To adequately cover these special events and provide medical coverage to all areas of the city, New Orleans EMS relies on several types of highly specialized response vehicles (SRVs) and highly trained emergency medical technicians and paramedics.<ref name= srv>{{cite web| url=http://www.cityofno.com/pg-126-7-special-event-coverage.aspx |title=New Orleans EMS Special Event Coverage |publisher=New Orleans EMS |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>
===Bike Teams===
The New Orleans EMS Bike Team consists of pairs of emergency medical technicians and paramedics who have taken the International Police Mountain Bike Association (IPMBA) course for Emergency Medical Services. The bike teams are utilized at outdoor festivals, music events, and extensively throughout the [[French Quarter]]. The bike teams carry an [[automated external defibrillator]], cardiac monitoring equipment, and all the medications and supplies necessary for any medical or traumatic complaint.
===Special Response Vehicles===
New Orleans EMS operates three special response vehicles (SRVs) at various times. These vehicles consist of one modified [[John Deere Gator]] and two Alternative Support Apparatus (ASAP) Off-Road specialty vehicles. Both the Gator and the ASAP are used to extract sick or injured patients from areas with limited accessibility or large crowds. The Gator and ASAP are often used in parks, along parade routes, in the area around the [[Louisiana Superdome]], and especially in the [[French Quarter]] where narrow streets and large crowds can make it difficult for full sized ambulances to maneuver. The SRVs are equipped with all the equipment found on a full-size ambulance and can transport a patient from the confined area to an [[aid station]] or transfer care to a waiting ambulance for transport to a hospital.
===Emergency Medical Surge Unit===
In February, 2010, New Orleans EMS acquired a medical ambulance bus (MAB) from Sartin Services, Inc. The MAB was named Emergency Medical Surge Unit (EMSU)-1 and has the capacity to transport 18 patients on stretchers and litters and 2 wheelchair patients, as well as six emergency medical technicians or paramedics. EMSU-1 was introduced to the public during the [[New Orleans Saints]] [[Super Bowl XLIV]] Championship Parade on Tuesday, February 9, 2010.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fox8live.com/mostpopular/story/saints-super-bowl-champion-parade/c2HsFYJ8m0KUAe0V0jXRfQ.cspx  |title=There's a "big thang" happening in New Orleans- New Orleans Saints Super Bowl Parade |publisher=Fox 8 New Orleans |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.wwl.com/Saints-parade-lineup--route-and-more/6322401  |title=Saints Parade Lineup, Route And More |publisher=WWL New Orleans |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>

EMSU-1 saw extensive use as an on site treatment unit in support of the [[Rock ‘n’ Roll Mardi Gras Marathon]], serving to greatly expand the ability and capacity of New Orleans EMS, and allowing on site delivery of acute medical care by emergency physicians and personnel.

==Community Outreach==
Led by Elizabeth Belcher, the Community Outreach Program of New Orleans EMS is focused on "preventative health and safety education for the citizens of Orleans parish. The overall goal is to develop and implement interactive programs to aid in the mission of saving lives. New Orleans EMS believes that prevention is key in this mission, and strives to supply the public with the knowledge and tools necessary to stay safe and healthy."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cityofno.com/pg-126-53-noems-community-outreach.aspx |title=New Orleans EMS Community Outreach |publisher=New Orleans EMS |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>

The Community Outreach Program teaches children safety and awareness through the T.A.S.K (Teaching Awareness and Safety to Kids)in child care centers, schools, and community centers. The Community Outreach Program is developing a program to target senior citizens and those with limited mobility and provide education and resources regarding environmental modification and [[fall prevention]]. Emergency medical technicians and paramedics with New Orleans EMS also mentor local students, teach public [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and [[first aid]] classes.
