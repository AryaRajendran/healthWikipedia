==Paralympic movement==
[[Ludwig Guttmann]] was the founder of the modern [[Paralympic Games]] that started with the [[Stoke Mandeville Games]]. Bedbook was challenged by Guttmann to bring organised sport to the disabled in Australia when Guttmann visited Bedbrooke at the [[Royal Perth Hospital]] in 1956.  The year after Guttmann's visit, Bedbrooke helped Australia to send its first team to compete in the Stoke Mandeville Games.<ref name=Brittain-11>{{harvnb|Brittain|2010|p=11}}</ref> The first team consisted of seven athletes six of whom were from Bedbrooke's ward at the hospital, and the seventh from Sydney. Bedbrooke did extensive fundraising to help cover the travel expenses of the athletes from Royal Perth Hospital.<ref name=Scruton-80>{{harvnb|Scruton|1998|p=80}}</ref>

In 1962, Bedbrook was the primary organiser of the [[1962 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games|first Commonwealth Paraplegic Games]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]], the counterpart of the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|regular British Empire and Commonwealth Games]].  He served as the Game's General Secretary.<ref name=Scruton-167>{{harvnb|Scruton|1998|p=167}}</ref>  Guttmann presented Bedbrook with a Stoke Mandeville Games pennant during the games's opening ceremony.  This pennant was prized because of the level of commitment it entailed to the disabled athletic ideal.<ref name=Scruton-168>{{harvnb|Scruton|1998|p=168}}</ref>  Bedbrook, [[Hugh Leslie]] and [[John Grant (Australian doctor)|John Grant]] were credited with making the games a huge success, with athletes such as [[Sally Haynes]] praising the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone working at the event.<ref name=Scruton-170>{{harvnb|Scruton|1998|p=170}}</ref>

In 1964, the [[International Stoke Mandeville Games Committee]] (ISMGC) held a meeting of managers and trainers in [[Tokyo, Japan]]. This meeting resulted in the enlargement of the number of nations represented by the organisation.  Bedbrook nominated Australia for inclusion and the organisation's constitution was modified to include Australia alongside [[Argentina]], Germany, Japan, and [[Rhodesia]].<ref name=Scruton-99>{{harvnb|Scruton|1998|p=99}}</ref> This also resulted in Bedbrook becoming a member of the ISMGC that year.<ref name=Scruton-181>{{harvnb|Scruton|1998|p=181}}</ref> In 1967m the ISMGC set up a Medical Sub-Committee.  Bedbrook was the first chair of this committee.<ref name=Scruton-181/> In 1972, Bedbrook was replaced by Doctor J. Grant on the ISMGC.<ref name=Scruton-183>{{harvnb|Scruton|1998|p=183}}</ref>   In 1964, Bedbrook served as the Australian team leader at the Paralympics. At the [[1968 Summer Paralympics|1968 Tel Aviv Paralympics]], Bedbrook served as the Australian SMGF Delegate.<ref name=wpwa-2009>{{harvnb|Wheelchair Sport WA|2009}}</ref>

In 1974, the fourth [[Commonwealth Paraplegic Games]] were held in [[Dunedin, New Zealand]]. Bedbrook served on the Medical Grading Committee for the Games. He also served on the Jury of Appeal for the Games.<ref name=Scruton-175>{{harvnb|Scruton|1998|p=175}}</ref>  These games were the last Commonwealth Paraplegic Games, the decision having been made by the Commonwealth Games Committee, of which Bedbrook was the chairman. Bedbrook recommended that the games be replaced by a zone based competition, similar to the [[Pan-American Games]].<ref name=Scruton-178>{{harvnb|Scruton|1998|p=178}}</ref> Consequently, he helped to found the [[FESPIC Games]] for [[Pacific Rim]] countries.<ref name="hof"/>
