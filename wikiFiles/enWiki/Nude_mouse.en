A '''nude mouse''' is a [[laboratory mouse]] from a strain with a [[genetic mutation]] that causes a deteriorated or absent [[thymus]], resulting in an inhibited [[immune system]] due to a greatly reduced number of [[T cells]].  The phenotype, or main outward appearance of the mouse is a lack of body hair, which gives it the "nude" nickname.  The nude mouse is valuable to research because it can receive many different types of tissue and tumor grafts, as it mounts no [[rejection]] response.  These [[xenografts]] are commonly used in research to test new methods of imaging and treating tumors.  The genetic basis of the nude mouse mutation is a disruption of the [[FOXN1]] gene.<ref>{{cite journal |title=New Gene name for Nude Mice |journal=JAX Bulletin |issue=6 |date=May 25, 2000 |url=http://jaxmice.jax.org/faq/bulletin/bulletin06.html}}</ref><ref>{{OMIM|600838|FORKHEAD BOX N1; FOXN1}}</ref>

==Nomenclature==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nude mouse.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Nude mouse]] -->
The nomenclature for the nude mouse has changed several times since their discovery. Originally they were described as ''nu'' and this was updated to ''Hfh11nu'' when the mutated gene was identified as a mutation in the HNF-3/forkhead homolog 11 gene.  Then in 2000 the [[gene]] responsible for the mutation was identified as a member of the Fox gene family and the nomenclature was updated to ''Foxn1nu''.

== History and significance ==
Nude mice were first discovered in 1962 by Dr. N. R. Grist at [[Ruchill]] Hospital's Brownlee virology laboratory in [[Glasgow]].<ref>http://www.animalresearch.info/en/science/animalsused/mouse-nude</ref><ref>http://www.criver.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/NMRI%20nude24.04.07.pdf</ref> Because they lack a thymus, nude mice cannot generate mature [[T lymphocytes]]. Therefore they are unable to mount most types of [[immune response]]s, including: 

#antibody formation that requires [[CD4]]+ [[helper T cells]]
#[[Cell-mediated immunity|cell-mediated immune responses]], which require CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells
#delayed-type [[hypersensitivity]] responses (require CD4+ T cells)
#killing of virus-infected or [[malignant]] cells (requires [[CD8]]+ [[cytotoxic T cells]])
#[[graft rejection]] (requires both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells)

Because of the above features, nude mice have served in the laboratory to gain insights into the [[immune system]], [[leukemia]], solid [[tumors]], [[AIDS]] and other forms of [[immune deficiency]] as well as [[leprosy]].
Moreover, the absence of functioning T cells prevents nude mice from rejecting not only [[allografts]], but they cannot even reject [[xenografts]]; that is, grafts of tissue from another species.

Most strains of nude mice are slightly "leaky" and do have a few T cells, especially as they age.  For this reason, nude mice are less popular in research today, since [[knockout mice]] with more complete defects  in the immune system have been constructed (e.g. RAG1 and RAG2 knockout mice).

==Genetics==

Nude mice have a spontaneous deletion in the FOXN1 gene.  (Humans with mutations in FOXN1 also are athymic and immune deficient.)  Mice with a targeted deletion in the FOXN1 ("knockout" mice) also show the "nude" phenotype.   Since ''nude'' females have underdeveloped mammary glands and are unable to effectively nurse their young, nude males are bred with [[heterozygous]] females.

== Life span ==
The life span of nude mice is normally 6 months to a year. In controlled, germ free environments and with antibiotic treatments found in many laboratories that routinely use nude mice, they can live almost as long as normal mice (18 months to two years).
