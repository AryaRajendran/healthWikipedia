'''George Miller Beard''' (May 8, 1839 &ndash; January 23, 1883) was a U.S. [[Neurology|neurologist]] who popularized the term [[neurasthenia]], starting around 1869. 

==Biography==
Beard was born in [[Montville, Connecticut]] on May 8, 1839, to Rev. Spencer F. Beard, a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister, and Lucy A. Leonard. Beard's mother died in 1842 and his father remarried the following year to Mary Ann Fellowes.<ref name="Notable People from Montville's Past">''Notable People from Montvilleâ€™s Past: Dr. George M. Beard, Neurologist Extraordinaire, Donna Jacobson, 2011.</ref> He graduated from [[Yale University|Yale College]] in 1862, and received his [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] from the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York]] in 1866. While still in medical school during the [[American Civil War]], he served as an assistant surgeon in the [[West Gulf squadron]] of the [[United States Navy]] aboard the gunboat ''New London''. After the war and graduation from medical school, he married Elizabeth Ann Alden, of [[Westville, Connecticut]], on December 25, 1866.<ref name="Dictionary of American Biography">''Dictionary of American Biography'' Base Set. American Council of Learned Societies, 1928-1936.</ref>

He is remembered best for having defined neurasthenia as a medical condition with symptoms of [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[anxiety]], [[headache]], [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]], [[neuralgia]] and [[Melancholia|depression]], as a result of exhaustion of the [[central nervous system|central nervous system's]] energy reserves, which Beard attributed to civilization. Physicians who agreed with Beard associated neurasthenia with the [[Stress (medicine)|stresses]] of urbanization and the increasingly competitive business environment. Stated simply, people were attempting to achieve more than their constitution could cope with. Typically this followed a short illness from which the patient was thought to have recovered.<ref name="The Relation of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Neurasthenia">''A Handbook of Practical Treatment'', John H. Musser, M.D. and O. A.  Kelly, M.D., 1912.</ref>

One of the more unusual disorders he studied from 1878 onwards was the exaggerated [[startle reflex]] among [[French-Canadian]] [[lumberjacks|lumbermen]] from the [[Moosehead Lake]] region of Maine, that came to be known as the [[Jumping Frenchmen of Maine]]. If they were startled by a short verbal command, they would carry out the instruction without hesitation, irrespective of the consequences. The studies stimulated further research by the military and [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]].<ref>

Beard was also involved extensively with  [[electro-therapeutics|electricity as a medical treatment]], and published extensively on the subject. He was a champion of many reforms of [[psychiatry]], and was a founder of the [[National Association for the Protection of the Insane and the Prevention of Insanity]]. He also took an unpopular stance against the [[death penalty]] for persons with [[mental illness]], going so far as to campaign for leniency for [[Charles J. Guiteau]], the assassin of [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Garfield]] on the basis that the man was not guilty because of [[insanity]].<ref name="Dictionary of American Biography"/>

Beard was a critic of [[Spiritualism]] which he wrote was one of history's greatest [[delusion]]s.<ref>Eric Caplan. (2011). ''Mind Games: American Culture and the Birth of Psychotherapy''. University of California Press. p. 187</ref> He published articles on [[anomalistic psychology]] such as ''The Psychology of Spiritism'' (1879) exposing the fraud of [[mediumship]] and describing its psychological basis.<ref>George Beard.
