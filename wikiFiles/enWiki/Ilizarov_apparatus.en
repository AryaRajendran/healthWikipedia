The '''Ilizarov apparatus''' is used in [[surgery|surgical]] procedures to lengthen or reshape limb bones; to treat complex and/or open [[bone fracture]]s; and in cases of infected non-unions of bones that are not amenable with other techniques.  It is named after the orthopedic surgeon [[Gavriil Abramovich Ilizarov]] from the Soviet Union, who pioneered the technique.

The Ilizarov external fixators can be used to correct angular deformity in the leg, to correct leg-length differences, and treat non-unions.<ref name="Spiegelberg"/> In most developing countries it is a highly specialized technique used mainly for deformity correction by experienced surgeons due to its complexity. Further development of the ring construct led to the [[Taylor Spatial Frame]] which is more versatile and far easier to use, but very costly. Intramedullary limb lengthening devices are also available, but they are not suitable for deformity correction of bones.

==Mechanics and physics==

The device is a specialized form of [[external fixator]], a [[circular fixator]], modular in construction. [[Stainless steel]] (or [[titanium]]) rings are fixed to the bone via stainless heavy-gauge wire (called "pins" or [[Kirschner wire]]s). The rings are connected to each other with threaded rods attached through adjustable nuts. The circular construction and tensioned wires of the Ilizarov apparatus provide far more structural support than the traditional monolateral fixator system. This allows early weightbearing. 

The apparatus is based on the principle which Ilizarov called as "the theory of tensions". Through controlled and mechanically applied tension stress, Ilizarov was able to show that the bone and soft tissue can be made to regenerate in a reliable and reproducible manner.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Paley|first1=Dror|last2=Kovelman|first2=Harry F|last3=Herzenberg |first3=John E|editor=Stauffer, Richard|title=Advances in Operative Orthopaedics: Volume 1|url=http://limblengtheningdoc.org/Ilizarov_techonlogy.pdf|accessdate=14 January 2012|date=October 1993|publisher=Mosby Inc|isbn=978-0-8151-7939-9|pages=243–287|chapter=Ilizarov technology|format=PDF}}</ref> The top rings of the Ilizarov (fixed to the healthy bone by the tensioned wire) allow force to be transferred through the external frame (the vertical metal rods), bypassing the fracture site.  Force is then transferred back to the healthy bone through the bottom ring and the tensioned wires.  This allows the Ilizarov apparatus to act as a sort of bridge, both immobilizing the fracture site and relieving it of stress, while allowing for the movement of the entire limb and partial weight-bearing.  Middle rings (and tensioned wires) act to hold the bone fragments in place and to give greater structural support to the apparatus and limb.  However, the critical load bearing rings are the top and bottom rings which transfer the force from the healthy bone down to the healthy bone, bypassing the fracture site.

==Bone lengthening/reshaping==

In addition to being used to support a fractured limb, the Ilizarov frame is also commonly used to correct deformity through [[distraction osteogenesis]].

The procedure consists of an initial surgery, during which the bone is surgically fractured and the ring apparatus is attached. As the patient recovers, the fractured bone begins to grow together. While the bone is growing, the frame is adjusted by means of turning the nuts, thus increasing the space between two rings. As the rings are connected to opposite sides of the fracture, this adjustment, done four times a day, moves the now-healing fracture apart by approximately one millimeter per day. The incremental daily increases result in a considerable lengthening of the limb over time. Once the lengthening phase is complete, the apparatus stays on the limb for a consolidation period. The patient is able to fully weight bear on the Ilizarov frame, using crutches initially and pain is lessened. Once healing is complete, a second surgery is necessary to remove the ring apparatus. The result is a limb that is significantly longer. Additional surgery may be necessary, in the case of leg lengthening, to lengthen the [[Achilles tendon]] to accommodate the longer bone length. The major advantage of this procedure is that because the apparatus provides complete support while the bone is recovering the patient can remain active aiding recovery.

A further use is of bone transport, whereby a defect in a long bone can be treated by transporting a segment of bone, whilst simultaneously lengthening regenerate to reduce the defect and finally dock with the other segment, producing a single bony unit.

While the Ilizarov apparatus is minimally invasive (no large incisions are made,) it is not free of complications. Pain is common and can be severe, but is treatable with [[analgesics]]. Careful attention to  cleaning and hygiene is necessary to prevent pin site infection. Other complications include swelling, muscle transfixion, and joint [[contracture]]s.  Physical therapy is often indicated.

==Bone fracture treatment==

The Ilizarov method is widely used to treat complex and/or open bone fractures.  This method is preferred over conventional treatment options (such as [[internal fixator]] or [[Cast (orthopedic)|cast]]) where there is a high risk of infection or the fracture is of such severity that internal fixators are unworkable.
