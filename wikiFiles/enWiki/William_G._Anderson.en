==Biography==
Anderson was born in [[Americus, Georgia]], on December 12, 1927, to John D. Anderson and Emma Gilchrist Anderson. After obtaining an undergraduate degree from Alabama State College for Negroes (now [[Alabama State University]]) in 1949, Anderson attended [[Des Moines University]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], and received his certification in surgery.  

Anderson served as associate dean of the [[Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine]], a clinical professor of [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic]] surgical specialties at [[Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine|Michigan State University's College of Osteopathic Medicine]] and was responsible for the development of osteopathic medical education programs for students, interns, and residents at Oakland General, Detroit Riverview, Macomb and St. John Hospitals. 

Anderson is perhaps best known for his work in the [[civil rights movement]].  In 1957, after completing his residency in [[Flint, Michigan]], Anderson relocated to [[Albany, Georgia]], to start his practice. However, because of the stringent segregationist policies in place and racist attitudes of local townsfolk, Anderson was prevented from treating patients. Anderson decided to respond to this unjust resistance by becoming the founder and first president of the [[Albany Movement]].  Anderson took part in hundreds of civil rights marches and worked closely with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Anderson is also a member of [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]].

As of 2010, Anderson is the member of the [[Board of Directors]] at the [[Virginia]] campus of VCOM, the [[Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vcom.vt.edu/catalog/administration.html|title=''Anderson Member of Board of Directors at VCOM''|publisher=vcom.vt.edu|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref>
