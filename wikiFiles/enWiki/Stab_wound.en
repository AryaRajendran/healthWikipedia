A '''stab wound''' is a specific form of [[penetrating trauma]] to the [[Human skin|skin]] that results from a [[knife]] or a similar pointed object that is "deeper than it is wide".<ref name=rosens/><ref name="tabers">{{cite book |author=Taber, Clarence Wilbur; Venes, Donald |title=Taber's cyclopedic medical dictionary |publisher=F a Davis Co |location= |year=2009 |page=2189 |isbn=0-8036-1559-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="stab">{{cite journal |author=Mankin SL |title=Emergency!

==Management==
Stab wounds can cause various internal and external injuries. Stab wounds are generally low velocity weapons meaning the injuries inflicted on a person are typically confined to the path it took internally, instead of causing damage to surrounding tissue which is common of gun shot wounds.<ref name="missile">{{cite journal | title=Missile and explosive wounds | author=Christopher McLean, Jonathan Hull | journal=Surgery (Oxford) | year=2006 | month=June | volume=22 | issue=6 | pages=194–7 | doi=10.1383/surg.2006.24.6.194}}</ref> The [[abdomen]] is the most commonly injured area from a stab wound because in most cases stab wounds occur below the nipple and penetrate the abdomen. Interventions that may be needed depending on severity of the injury include [[airway]], [[intravenous]] access, and  control of [[hemorrhage]].<ref name=guidelines/><ref name="btls">{{cite book |author=Campbell, John Creighton |title=Basic trauma life support for paramedics and other advanced providers |publisher=Brady/Prentice Hall Health |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-13-084584-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> The length and size of the knife [[blade]], as well as the trajectory it followed, may be important in planning management as it can be a predictor of what structures were damaged.<ref name=rosens/><ref name=stab/> Special precautions should also be used to prevent further injury from a [[perpetrator]] to the victim in a [[hospital]] setting.<ref name="nursing">{{cite journal |author=Bird J, Faulkner M |title=Emergency care and management of patients with stab wounds |journal=Nurs Stand |volume=23 |issue=21 |pages=51–7; quiz 58 |year=2009 |pmid=19248451 |doi= |url= |accessdate=2011-10-02}}</ref>  Similarly to treating [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], it is important to keep the systolic pressure above 90mmHg, maintain the persons core body temperature, and for prompt transport to a [[trauma center]] in severe cases.<ref name="rosens" /><ref name="JEMS">{{cite web | url=http://www.jems.com/article/patient-care/patient-suffers-multiple-stab-wounds | title=Patient Suffers Multiple Stab Wounds: A 19-year-old male was stabbed multiple times in the chest | publisher=Elsevier Inc. | work=Journal of Emergency Medical Services | date=June 7, 2012 | accessdate=July 17, 2012 | author=Edgerly, Dennis}}</ref>

To determine if internal bleeding is present a [[focused assessment with sonography for trauma|focused assessment with sonography]] (FAST) or [[diagnostic peritoneal lavage]] (DPL) can be used. Other diagnostic tests such as a [[computed tomography]] scan or various [[contrast medium|contrast studies]] can be used to more definitively classify the injury in both severity and location.<ref name="ATLS">{{cite book | title=ATLS: Advanced Trauma Life Support for Doctors | publisher=American College of Surgeons | year=2008 | pages=113–9 | isbn=978-1880696316}}</ref> Observation can be used in place of surgery as it can substitute an unnecessary surgery, which makes it the preferred treatment of penetrating trauma secondary to a stab wound when [[hypovolemia]] or shock is not present.<ref name="PHTLS">{{cite book |author= |title=PHTLS: Prehospital Trauma Life Support |publisher=Mosby/JEMS |location= |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-323-06502-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Surgery===
[[surgical|Surgical intervention]] may be required but it depends on what [[organ system]]s are effected by the wound and the extent of the damage.<ref name=stab/> It is important for care providers to thoroughly check the wound site inasmuch as a [[laceration]] of an [[artery]] often results in delayed complications sometimes leading to [[death]].<ref name="rosens">{{cite book |author=Rosen, Peter; John J.

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Hilt wound.jpg|thumb|Hilt mark left from a knife]]
Stabbings are a relatively common cause of [[homicide]] in Canada<ref name=StatsCan/> and the USA.<ref name=USAStat/> Typically deaths caused by stabbings are due to [[organ failure]] or [[blood loss]]. They are the mechanism of approximately 2% of [[suicide]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riviello|first=edited by Ralph J.|title=Manual of forensic emergency medicine : a guide for clinicians|year=2010|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=978-0-7637-4462-5|pages=18}}</ref> Most stab wounds are caused by intentional [[violence]], as the [[weapon]]s to inflict such a wound are readily available compared to that of a [[gun]].<ref name="justice">{{cite book | title=Knife crime : review of evidence and policy | publisher=Centre for Crime and Justice Studies | author=Eades, Chris | year=2007 | location=London | isbn=1906003068}}</ref>

In Canada [[homicides]] by stabbing and gun shot occur relatively equally (1008 to 980 for the years 2005 to 2009).<ref name=StatsCan>http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/legal01-eng.htm Homicides by method</ref> In the United States guns are a more common method of homicide (9,484 verses 1,897 for stabbing or cutting in 2008).<ref name=USAStat>http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004888.html Murder Victims, by Weapons Used</ref>

Stab wounds occur four times more than [[gunshot wounds]] in the United Kingdom, but the [[mortality rate]] associated with stabbing has ranged from 0-4% as 85% of injuries sustained from stab wounds only affect [[subcutaneous tissue]].<ref name=btls/><ref name=nursing/><ref name="terrorist">{{cite journal |author=Hanoch J, Feigin E, Pikarsky A, Kugel C, Rivkind A |title=Stab wounds associated with terrorist activities in Israel |journal=JAMA |volume=276 |issue=5 |pages=388–90 |year=1996 |month=August |pmid=8683817 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Most [[assault]]s resulting in a stab wound occur to men and persons of [[ethnic minorities]].<ref name="epi">{{cite journal |author=El-Abdellati E, Messaoudi N, Van Hee R |title=Assault induced stab injuries: epidemiology and actual treatment strategy |journal=[[Acta Chirurgica Belgica]] |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=146–54 |year=2011 |pmid=21780521 |doi= |url= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}</ref>

==History==
The first successful operation on a person who was stabbed in the [[heart]] was performed in 1896 by [[Ludwig Rehn]], in what is now considered the first case of [[heart surgery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cardiacsurgery.ctsnetbooks.org/cgi/content/full/3/2008/3?ck=nck |title=History of Cardiac Surgery - Stephenson 3 (2008): 3 - Cardiac Surgery in the Adult |publisher=Cardiacsurgery.ctsnetbooks.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}</ref> In the late 1800s it was hard to treat stab wounds because of poor transportation of victims to health facilities, and the low ability for surgeons to effectively repair organs, however; the use of [[laparotomy]]s which has been developed a few years earlier had provided better patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Gun Shot Wounds of the Abdomen with Report of Fifty Eight Cases | journal=Academy of Medicine of Cincinnati |date=1899-01-09|first =J.C.|last=Oliver | pages=354–75|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iEFYAAAAMAAJ&lr&pg=PA353#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref>
