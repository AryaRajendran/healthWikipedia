In 2001, the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) began to publish its biennial ''National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals'', which reports a statistically representative sample of the U.S. population.<ref name=CDC_about>{{cite web | title = About the Program | work = cdc.gov | publisher = Centers for Disease Control | date = 3 April 2008 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/about.html | accessdate = 25 May 2009}}</ref> The [[Environmental Working Group]] has also conducted biomonitoring studies.<ref name=EWG/>

==Overview==

Historically, public health regulations have been based on theoretical risk calculations according to known levels of chemical substances in air, water, soil, food, other consumer products and other sources of potential exposure. Human biomonitoring offers the opportunity to analyze the actual internal levels of bodily substances from all potential routes of exposure at one time, which may contribute to improving risk assessments.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Juberg |first1=Daland R. |last2=Bus |first2=James |last3=Katz |first3=Diane S. |title=The Opportunities and Limitations of Biomonitoring |journal=Policy Brief |month=February |year=2008 |publisher=[[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] |url=http://www.mackinac.org/archives/2008/s2008-01.pdf}}</ref> Scientific advancements have made it possible to detect a greater number of chemical substances in smaller concentrations in the body, with some chemicals detectable at levels as low as parts per trillion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_acc/bin.asp?CID=257&DID=1584&DOC=FILE.PDF |title=What is Biomonitoring? |format=PDF |work=American Chemistry Council |accessdate=11 January 2009}}</ref> A single biomonitoring measurement is only one snapshot in time and may not accurately reflect the level of exposure over longer periods.<ref name=Foster_Agzarian>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00216-006-0822-6 |title=Reporting results of biomonitoring studies |year=2006 |last1=Foster |first1=Warren G. |last2=Agzarian |first2=John |journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry |volume=387 |pages=137–40 |pmid=17093961 |issue=1}}</ref>

In 2006 the [[United States National Research Council|U.S. National Research Council]] published a report, ''Human Biomonitoring for Environmental Chemicals''. The report recognized the value of biomonitoring for better understanding exposure to environmental chemicals, and included several findings and recommendations to improve the utility of biomonitoring data for [[health risk assessment]].<ref name=NRCReport>{{cite news|last=Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology|title=Human Biomonitoring for Environmental Chemicals|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11700&page=1|accessdate=1/20/2012|newspaper=U.S. National Research Council|year=2006}}</ref> In summary, the report called for more rigorous health-based criteria for selecting chemicals to include in biomonitoring studies; the development of tools and techniques to improve risk-based interpretation and communication of biomonitoring data; integration of biomonitoring into exposure assessment and epidemiological research; and exploration of bioethical issues around biomonitoring, including informed consent, confidentiality of results, and others.<ref>{{cite web | title = Statement on Biomonitoring | work = acs.org | url = http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=PP_SUPERARTICLE&node_id=1901&use_sec=false&sec_url_var=region1&__uuid=d3db2ed2-5853-4b7f-932b-fe46125e26b6 | accessdate = 23 July 2009}}</ref>

The issue of exposure to environmental chemicals has received attention as a result of televised reports by [[Bill Moyers]] for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and [[Anderson Cooper]] for [[CNN]]'s "[[Planet in Peril]]" series.<ref>{{cite web | title = Planet in Peril | work = CNN.com | publisher = CNN | date = October 2007 | url = http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2007/planet.in.peril/ | accessdate = 13 December 2009}}</ref> The book ''[[Our Stolen Future]]'', with a foreword by former Vice President [[Al Gore]], also raised awareness by focusing on [[endocrine disruption]].

==''National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals''==
The CDC's Division of Laboratory Sciences within the National Center for Environmental Health has developed a National Biomonitoring Program, and publishes the biennial ''National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals''. As the selection of chemicals is controversial, the CDC has identified influential criteria:<ref name=chemrisk>{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.8755 |title=Biomonitoring and Biomarkers: Exposure Assessment Will Never Be the Same |year=2006 |last1=Paustenbach |first1=Dennis |last2=Galbraith |first2=David |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=114 |issue=8 |pages=1143–9 |pmid=16882516 |pmc=1552022}}</ref>
*Evidence of exposure in a U.S. population
*The presence and significance of health effects after a given level of exposure
*Desire to track public health initiatives to reduce exposure to a given agent
*Existing method for accurately measuring biologically relevant concentrations of the chemical
*Sufficient tissue specimens, in particular, blood and/or urine samples
*Cost-effectiveness.

CDC has also established three criteria for removing chemicals from future editions of the National Report:
*A new replacement chemical (i.e., a metabolite or other chemical) is more representative of exposure than the chemical currently measured, or
*If after three survey periods, detection rates for all chemicals within a method-related group are less than 5 percent for all population subgroups (i.e., two sexes, three race/ethnicity groups, and the age groups used in the National Report), or
*If after three survey periods, levels of chemicals within a method-related group are unchanged or declining in all demographic subgroups documented in the National Report.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Public Comments and Revised Criteria for Removing Chemicals Future Editions of CDC's National Report on Human Exposure Environmental Chemicals | url = http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/| work = Federal Register | volume = 73 | issue = 61 | pages = 16688 | date = 28 March 2008 | accessdate = 10 November 2009}}</ref>

==National Children's Study==
In collaboration with the National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD), [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] and U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]], the CDC's Environmental Health Laboratory has announced it will play a key role in the biomonitoring of the ongoing [[National Children's Study]], which plans to follow 100,000 children across the United States from birth until age 21. The study was authorized as part of the [[Children's Health Act]] of 2000 and is the largest effort undertaken to address the effects of social, economic and environmental factors on a child's health.<ref>{{cite web | title = National Children's Study | work = cdc.gov | date = 2009-07-07 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/childrens_study.html | accessdate = 23 July 2009}}</ref>

The presence of an environmental chemical in the body does not necessarily indicate harm.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interpreting the Data |url=http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/ |work=Third National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |year=2007 |accessdate=30 September 2009}}</ref> The analytical chemistry of detecting chemicals has advanced more rapidly than the ability to interpret the potential health consequences.<ref name=NRC>{{Cite document | title = Human Biomonitoring for Environmental Chemicals | year = 2008 | publisher = National Research Council | url = http://www.nao.edu/catalog/11700.html | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Lead]] is a well studied chemical with a CDC action level level of concern, currently at 10&nbsp;µg/dL, or 100 [[parts per billion]], in blood; however, neurobehavioral impairment has been noted below this level.<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/lead/pb_standards2.html Lead (Pb) Toxicity: What Are the U.S. Standards for Lead Levels?] [[ATSDR]].</ref> Because this approach requires establishment of cause and effect in epidemiological studies and a thorough understanding of human dose response, data to support these types of action levels exist for only a few environmental chemicals.  The concept of Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs) has been developed as an alternative approach to aid in interpreting and communicating biomonitoring results in the context of potential risks to health.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interpretation of Report Data: Important Factors|url=http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/data_tables/interpretation.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2/28/2012}}</ref>

==Biomonitoring Equivalents==

Scientists performing biomonitoring testing are able to detect and measure concentrations of natural and manmade chemicals in human blood and urine samples at parts-per-billion to parts-per-quadrillion levels. A 2006 [[U.S. National Research Council]] report found that while scientists were capable of detecting the chemicals at these levels, methods for interpreting and communicating what their presence meant regarding potential health risks to an individual or population were still lacking.<ref name="NRCReport" /> The report recommended that scientific research be done to improve the interpretation and communication of biomonitoring results through the use of existing risk assessments of specific chemicals.<ref name="NRCReport" />

To address this situation, several groups  recognized that exposure guidance values, such as [[reference dose]] and [[tolerable daily intake]], could, with sufficient data, be translated into corresponding estimates of [[biomarker]] concentrations for use in the interpretation of biomonitoring data.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.jes.7500540 |title=Reverse dosimetry: Interpreting trihalomethanes biomonitoring data using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling |year=2006 |last1=Tan |first1=Yu-Mei |last2=Liao |first2=Kai H |last3=Clewell |first3=Harvey J |journal=Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=591–603 |pmid=17108893}}</ref><ref name=ScreeningApproach>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2006.08.004 |title=Biomonitoring equivalents: A screening approach for interpreting biomonitoring results from a public health risk perspective |year=2007 |last1=Hays |first1=S.M. |last2=Becker |first2=R.A. |last3=Leung |first3=H.W. |last4=Aylward |first4=L.L. |last5=Pyatt |first5=D.W. |journal=[[Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]] |volume=47 |pages=96–109 |pmid=17030369 |issue=1}}</ref> In 2007, the initial methodology for the systematic translation of exposure guidance values into corresponding screening values for biomonitoring data, dubbed Biomonitoring Equivalents, was published by scientists from Summit Toxicology.<ref name="ScreeningApproach"/> Subsequently, an expert panel from government, industry and academia, convened to develop detailed guidelines for deriving and communicating these Biomonitoring Equivalents.<ref name="Pmid">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2008.05.004 |title=Guidelines for the derivation of Biomonitoring Equivalents: Report from the Biomonitoring Equivalents Expert Workshop |year=2008 |last1=Hays |first1=Sean M. |last2=Aylward |first2=Lesa L. |last3=Lakind |first3=Judy S. |last4=Bartels |first4=Michael J. |last5=Barton |first5=Hugh A. |last6=Boogaard |first6=Peter J. |last7=Brunk |first7=Conrad |last8=Dizio |first8=Stephen |last9=Dourson |first9=Michael |journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=S4–15 |pmid=18583008}}</ref> 

Biomonitoring Equivalents can be used for evaluation of biomonitoring data in a risk assessment context. Comparing biomonitoring data for a chemical with its Biomonitoring Equivalent provides a means for assessing whether population exposures to chemicals are within or above the levels considered safe by regulatory agencies.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cen-v086n014.p052 |title=Advertisement |year=2008 |journal=Chemical & Engineering News |volume=86 |issue=14 |pages=52}}</ref>  Biomonitoring Equivalents can thus assist scientists and risk managers in the prioritization of chemicals for follow-up or risk management activities.<ref name="ScreeningApproach" />

Since 2007, scientists have derived and published Biomonitoring Equivalents for more than 110 chemicals, including [[cadmium]], [[benzene]], [[chloroform]], [[arsenic]], [[toluene]], [[methylene chloride]], [[triclosan]], [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[volatile organic compounds]], and others.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijheh.2011.06.002 |title=Human biomonitoring assessment values: Approaches and data requirements |year=2011 |last1=Angerer |first1=Jürgen |last2=Aylward |first2=Lesa L. |last3=Hays |first3=Sean M. |last4=Heinzow |first4=Birger |last5=Wilhelm |first5=Michael |journal=International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health |volume=214 |issue=5 |pages=348–60 |pmid=21764371}}</ref><ref name="chemicalsubstanceschimiques">{{cite web|title=Monitoring and Surveillance Activities under Canada's Chemicals Management Plan|url=http://www.chemicalsubstanceschimiques.gc.ca/plan/surveil/index-eng.php|publisher=Government of Canada, Chemical Substances Division|accessdate=1/20/2012}}</ref> Several have been developed through collaborations of scientists from the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]], [[Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention|CDC]] and [[Health Canada]].<ref name="Pmid" /> Researchers from the German Human Biomonitoring Commission<ref name="Schulz2007" /> have also proposed a concept for deriving screening values similar to Biomonitoring Equivalents.<ref name="chemicalsubstanceschimiques" />

==Communication==
The National Research Council’s 2006 report emphasized that accurate communication of results is essential for the proper use of biomonitoring surveys, but at the same time noted "there is no accepted standard for good biomonitoring communications."<ref name=NRC/> In 2007, the [[Boston University School of Public Health]] organized a panel on this topic.<ref>{{cite web | title = Consensus Statement on Human Biomonitoring | work = Measuring Chemicals in People -- What Would You Say? | publisher = Boston University School of Public Health | url = http://www.biomonitoring06.org/uploads/Main/Consensus_statement_final.pdf | accessdate = 23 July 2009}}</ref> 

An expert panel on Biomonitoring Equivalents has published guidelines for communicating information to the general public and health care providers.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2008.05.007 |title=Guidelines for the communication of Biomonitoring Equivalents: Report from the Biomonitoring Equivalents Expert Workshop |year=2008 |last1=Lakind |first1=Judy S. |last2=Aylward |first2=Lesa L. |last3=Brunk |first3=Conrad |last4=Dizio |first4=Stephen |last5=Dourson |first5=Michael |last6=Goldstein |first6=Daniel A. |last7=Kilpatrick |first7=Michael E. |last8=Krewski |first8=Daniel |last9=Bartels |first9=Michael J. |journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=S16–26 |pmid=18579271}}</ref>
