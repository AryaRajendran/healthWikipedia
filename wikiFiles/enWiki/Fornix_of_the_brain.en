The '''fornix''' (Latin, "vault" or "arch") is a C-shaped bundle of fibers ([[axon]]s) in the [[brain]], and carries signals from the [[hippocampus]] to the [[hypothalamus]].

==Structure==
The fibres begin in the hippocampus on each side of the brain (where they are also known as the [[fimbria (neuroanatomy)|fimbria]]); the separate left and right side are each called the [[crus of the fornix]]. The bundles of fibres come together in the midline of the brain, forming the ''body'' of the fornix. The inferior edge of the [[septum pellucidum]] (a membrane that separates the two lateral [[ventricle (brain)|ventricle]]s) is attached to the upper face of the fornix body.

The body of the fornix travels anteriorly and divides again near the [[anterior commissure]]. The left and right parts reseparate, but there is also an anterior/posterior divergence. 
* The posterior fibres (called the ''postcommissural fornix'') of each side continue through the [[hypothalamus]] to the [[mammillary bodies]]; then to the [[anterior nuclei of thalamus]], which maps to [[cingulate cortex]]. 
* The anterior fibers (''precommissural fornix'') end at the [[septal nuclei]] and [[nucleus accumbens]] of each half of the brain.
