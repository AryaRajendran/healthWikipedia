'''Impetigo''' {{IPAc-en|ɪ|m|p|ɨ|ˈ|t|aɪ|ɡ|oʊ}} is a highly contagious [[bacteria]]l [[human skin|skin]] [[infection]] most common among pre-school children.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Impetigo/Pages/Introduction.aspx NHS Impetigo]</ref> People who play close contact sports such as [[rugby football|rugby]], [[American football]] and [[wrestling]] are also susceptible, regardless of age. Impetigo is not as common in adults. The name derives from the [[Latin]] ''impetere'' ("assail"). It is also known as '''school sores'''.<ref>[http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Impetigo_or_school_sores?OpenDocument Impetigo — school sores — Better Health Channel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Classification==
[[File:Impetigo-infected.jpg|thumb|Infected impetigo]]
===Impetigo contagiosa=== 
This common form of impetigo, also called nonbullous impetigo, most often begins as a red sore near the nose or mouth which soon breaks, leaking pus or fluid, and forms a honey-colored scab, followed by a red mark which heals without leaving a scar. Sores are not painful, but may be itchy. [[Lymph node]]s in the affected area may be swollen, but fever is rare. Touching or scratching the sores may easily spread the infection to other parts of the body.<ref name =Mayo> {{cite web |url= http://semj.sums.ac.ir/vol8/jul2007/impetigo.htm|title= Impetigo|author= Mayo Clinic staff|date= 5 October 2010|work= Mayo Clinic Health Information|publisher= Mayo Clinic|accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref>

===Bullous impetigo===
[[File:Impetigo.jpg|thumb|[[Bullous impetigo]]]]
[[Bullous impetigo]], mainly seen in children younger than 2 years, involves painless, fluid-filled [[blister]]s, mostly on the arms, legs and trunk, surrounded by red and itchy (but not sore) skin. The blisters may be large or small. After they break, they form yellow scabs.<ref name =Mayo/>

===Ecthyma===
In this form of impetigo, painful fluid- or pus-filled sores, usually on the arms and legs, become ulcers that penetrate deeper into the [[dermis]]. After they break open, they form hard, thick, gray-yellow scabs, which sometimes leave scars. It may be accompanied by swollen [[lymph node]]s in the affected area.<ref name =Mayo/>

==Causes==
It is primarily caused by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and sometimes by ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''.<ref name=Robbins>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; & Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 843 ISBN 978-1-4160-2973-1</ref> According to the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], both [[bullous]] and nonbullous are primarily caused by ''Staphylococcus aureus'', with ''Streptococcus ''also commonly being involved in the nonbullous form."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stulberg DL, Penrod MA, Blatny RA |title=Common bacterial skin infections. |journal=American Family Physician |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=119–24 |year=2002 |pmid=12126026 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020701/119.html}}</ref>

===Transmission===
The [[infection]] is spread by direct contact with [[lesion]]s or with [[human nose|nasal]] carriers. The [[incubation period]] is 1–3 days. Dried streptococci in the air are not infectious to intact skin. Scratching may spread the lesions.

==Diagnosis==
Impetigo generally appears as honey-colored scabs formed from dried [[Serum (blood)|serum]], and is often found on the arms, legs, or face.<ref name=Robbins/>

==Treatment==
For generations, the [[disease]] was treated with an application of the [[antiseptic]] [[gentian violet]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=MacDonald RS |title=Treatment of impetigo: Paint it blue |journal=BMJ  |volume=329 |issue=7472 |page=979 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15499130 |pmc=524121 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/329/7472/979 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7472.979}}</ref> Today, topical or oral [[antibiotic]]s are usually prescribed. Treatment may involve washing with soap and water and letting the impetigo dry in the air. Mild cases may be treated with [[bactericidal]] ointment, such as [[mupirocin]], which in some countries may be available over-the-counter. More severe cases require oral antibiotics, such as [[dicloxacillin]], [[flucloxacillin]] or [[erythromycin]]. Alternatively [[amoxicillin]] combined with [[clavulanate potassium]], cephalosporins (1st generation) and many others may also be used as an antibiotic treatment.

==Epidemiology==

Globally impetigo affected approximately 140&nbsp;million people (2% of the population) in 2010.<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163-96|pmid=23245607}}</ref>
