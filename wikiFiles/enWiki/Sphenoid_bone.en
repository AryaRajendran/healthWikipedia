The '''sphenoid bone''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|f|iː|n|ɔɪ|d}};<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sphenoid Entry "sphenoid"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref> from Greek ''sphenoeides'', "wedgelike") is an unpaired [[bone]] situated at the front middle of the [[skull]] in front of the [[temporal bone]] and basilar part of the [[occipital bone]]. 
The sphenoid bone is one of the seven bones that articulate to form the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]. Its shape somewhat resembles that of a [[butterfly]] or bat with its wings extended.

==Portions==
It is divided into the following parts:
* a median portion, known as the [[body of sphenoid bone]], containing the [[sella turcica]] which houses the [[pituitary gland]]
* two [[Greater wing of sphenoid bone|greater wings]] and two [[Lesser wing of sphenoid bone|lesser wings]]
* [[Pterygoid processes of the sphenoid]]es which project from it posteriorly (below)

Two [[sphenoidal conchae]] are situated at the anterior and posterior part of the body.

==Named features==

* pterygoid notch
* [[pterygoid fossa]]
* [[scaphoid fossa]]
* [[pterygoid hamulus]]
* [[pterygoid canal]]
* pterygospinous process

==In other animals==

The sphenoid bone of humans is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with a number of bones that are often separate in other animals, and have a somewhat complex arrangement.

In the early [[lobe-finned fish]]es and [[tetrapod]]s, the '''pterygoid''' bones were flat, wing-like bones forming the major part of the roof of the mouth.  Above the pterygoids were the '''[[epipterygoid]]''' bones, which formed part of a flexible joint between the braincase and the palatal region, as well as extending a vertical bar of bone towards the roof of the skull. Between the pterygoids lay an elongated, narrow '''[[parasphenoid]]''' bone, which also spread over some of the lower surface of the braincase, and connected, at its forward end, with a '''[[sphenethmoid]]''' bone helping to protect the [[olfactory nerve]]s. Finally, the '''basisphenoid''' bone formed part of the floor of the braincase and lay immediately above the parasphenoid.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 220–244|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

Aside from the loss of the flexible joint at the rear of the palate, this primitive pattern is broadly retained in [[reptile]]s, albeit with some individual modifications. In [[bird]]s, the epipterygoids are absent and the pterygoids considerably reduced. Living [[amphibian]]s have a relatively simplified skull in this region; a broad parasphenoid forms the floor of the braincase, the pterygoids are relatively small, and all other related bones except the sphenethmoid are absent.<ref name=VB/>

In [[mammal]]s, these various bones are often (though not always) fused into a single structure; the sphenoid. The basisphenoid forms the posterior part of the base, while the pterygoid processes represent the pterygoid bones. The epipterygoids have extended into the wall of the cranium; they are referred to as [[alisphenoid]]s when separate in mammals, and form the greater wings of the sphenoid when fused into a larger structure. The sphenethmoid bone forms as three bones: the lesser wings and the anterior part of the base. These two parts of the sphenethmoid may be distinguished as [[orbitosphenoid]]s and [[presphenoid]], respectively, although there is often<!-- not in the dog--> some degree of fusion. Only the parasphenoid appears to be entirely absent in mammals.<ref name=VB/>

In the [[dog]] the sphenoid is represented by 8 bones: basisphenoid, alisphenoids, presphenoid, orbitosphenoids, pterygoids.
