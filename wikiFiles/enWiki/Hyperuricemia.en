'''Hyperuricemia''' ({{lang-en-GB|hyperuricaemia}}) is a level of [[uric acid]] in the [[blood]] that is abnormally high. In humans, the upper end of the normal range is 360&nbsp;µmol/L (6&nbsp;mg/dL) for women and 400&nbsp;µmol/L (6.8&nbsp;mg/dL) for men.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chizyński K, Rózycka M |title=Hyperuricemia |language=Polish |journal=Pol.

==Causes==
Many factors contribute to hyperuricemia, including:  [[genetics]], [[insulin resistance]], [[hypertension]], [[renal insufficiency]], [[obesity]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], use of [[diuretic]]s, and consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

Causes of increased production include high levels of purine in the diet and increased [[purine metabolism]].  Causes of decreased excretion include kidney disease, certain drugs, and competition for excretion between uric acid and other molecules.  Mixed causes include high levels of alcohol and/or [[fructose]] in the diet, and starvation.

===Increased production===
A [[purine]]-rich diet is a common but minor cause of hyperuricemia.  Diet alone generally is not sufficient to cause hyperuricemia.  Purine content of foods varies (see [[Gout]]).  Foods high in the purines [[adenine]] and [[hypoxanthine]] may be more potent in exacerbating hyperuricemia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brulé D, Sarwar G, Savoie L |title=Changes in serum and urinary uric acid levels in normal human subjects fed purine-rich foods containing different amounts of adenine and hypoxanthine |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=353–8 |year=1992 |pmid=1619189 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Decreased excretion===
The principal drugs that contribute to hyperuricemia by decreased excretion are the primary [[antiuricosuric]]s.  Other drugs and agents include [[diuretic]]s, [[salicylate]]s, [[pyrazinamide]], [[ethambutol]], [[nicotinic acid]], [[ciclosporin]], 2-ethylamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole, and [[cytotoxic agent]]s.<ref name="pmid2070427">{{cite journal

Elevated blood [[lead]] is significantly correlated with both impaired kidney function and hyperuricemia (although the causal relationship among these correlations is not known).  In a study of over 2500 people resident in Taiwan, a [[blood lead level]] exceeding 7.5 microg/dL (a small elevation) had [[odds ratio]]s of 1.92 (95% CI: 1.18-3.10) for renal dysfunction and 2.72 (95% CI: 1.64-4.52) for hyperuricemia.<ref name="pmid18514766">{{cite journal

===Mixed===
Causes of hyperuricemia that are of mixed type have a dual action, both increasing production and decreasing excretion of uric acid.

High intake of alcohol ([[ethanol]]), a significant cause of hyperuricemia, has a dual action that is compounded by multiple mechanisms.  Ethanol increases production of uric acid by increasing production of [[lactic acid]], hence [[lactic acidosis]].  Ethanol also increases the plasma concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine via the acceleration of adenine nucleotide degradation, and is a possible weak inhibitor of xanthine dehydrogenase.  As a byproduct of its fermentation process, [[beer]] additionally contributes purines.  Ethanol decreases excretion of uric acid by promoting [[dehydration]] and (rarely) clinical [[ketoacidosis]].<ref name="Yamamoto+2005"/><!-- ref for whole paragraph -->

High dietary intake of [[fructose]] contributes significantly to hyperuricemia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nakagawa T |title=A causal role for uric acid in fructose-induced metabolic syndrome |journal=Am.

[[Starvation]] causes the body to metabolize its own (purine-rich) tissues for energy.  Thus, like a high purine diet, starvation increases the amount of purine converted to uric acid.

==Treatment==
Precipitation of uric acid crystals, and conversely their dissolution, is known to be dependent on the concentration of uric acid in solution, [[pH]], sodium concentration, and temperature.  Established treatments address these parameters.

===Concentration===
Following [[Le Chatelier's principle]], lowering the blood concentration of uric acid may permit any existing crystals of uric acid to be gradually dissolved into the blood, from whence the dissolved uric acid can be excreted.  Maintaining a lower blood concentration of uric acid similarly should reduce the formation of new crystals.  If the person has chronic [[gout]] or known [[Tophus|tophi]], then large quantities of uric acid crystals may have accumulated in joints and other tissues, and aggressive and/or long duration use of medications may be needed.

[[Medication]]s most often used to treat hyperuricemia are of two kinds: [[xanthine oxidase inhibitor]]s and [[uricosuric]]s.  Xanthine oxidase inhibitors decrease the production of uric acid, by interfering with [[xanthine oxidase]].  Uricosurics increase the excretion of uric acid, by reducing the reabsorption of uric acid once the kidneys have filtered it out of the blood.  Some of these medications are used as [[Indication (medicine)|indicated]], others are used [[Off-label use|off-label]].  Several other kinds of medications have potential for use in treating hyperuricemia.  In people receiving [[hemodialysis]], [[sevelamer]] can significantly reduce serum uric acid,<ref>{{cite journal

Non-medication treatments for hyperuricemia include a low [[purine]] diet (see [[Gout]]) and a variety of dietary supplements.  Treatment with [[lithium]] salts has been used as lithium improves uric acid solubility.

===pH===
Serum pH is neither safely or easily altered.  Therapies that alter pH principally alter the pH of urine, to discourage a possible complication of uricosuric therapy:  formation of uric acid kidney stones due to increased uric acid in the urine (see [[Nephrolithiasis]]).  Dietary supplements that can be used to make the urine more [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] include [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[potassium citrate]], [[magnesium citrate]], and Shohl's Solution (now replaced by Bicitra<ref>Ross, Mary. Rx Update December 1993. University of Iowa. 2009-02-16. URL:http://www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/pharmacy/RxUpdate/1993/12.December.html. Accessed: 2009-02-16. (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/5ecekFVcC)</ref>).  Medications that have a similar effect include [[acetazolamide]].

===Temperature===
Low temperature is a commonly reported trigger of acute gout:  an example would be a day spent standing in cold water, followed by an attack of gout the next morning.  This is believed to be due to temperature-dependent precipitation of uric acid crystals in tissues at below normal temperature.  Thus, one aim of prevention is to keep the hands and feet warm, and soaking in hot water may be therapeutic.

==Prognosis==
Increased levels predispose for [[gout]] and, if very high, [[renal failure|kidney failure]]. The [[metabolic syndrome]] often presents with hyperuricemia.

Persons with gout, and by inference hyperuricemia, are significantly less likely to develop [[Parkinson's disease]], unless they also require [[diuretic]]s.<ref name="pmid18975349">{{cite journal
