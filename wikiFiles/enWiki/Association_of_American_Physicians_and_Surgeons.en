==History==
During the winter of 1943, the Lake County (Indiana) Medical Committee opposed the [[Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill]], proposed legislation that would provide government health care for most U.S. citizens. Also opposed to the bill was the conservative National Physicians Committee. The committee began a membership drive in February 1944. By May 1944, the AAPS claimed members from all 48 states.<ref name="Portent"/> In 1944, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that the group's aim was the "defeat of any Government group medicine."<ref name="Portent"/> In 1966, the ''[[New York Times]]'' described AAPS as an "ultra-right-wing... political-economic rather than a medical group," and noted that some of its leaders were members of the [[John Birch Society]].<ref name="Rouse">{{cite news | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0714F73F55117B93C2AA178DD85F428685F9 | title = New Power in A.M.A.; Milford Owen Rouse | date = June 30, 1966 |work=New York Times | accessdate = March 16, 2007}}</ref>

==Political activity==

===Gun control===
In 1996, Dr Miguel A. Faria, Jr., a retired neurosurgeon and former Clinical Professor of Surgery (Neurosurgery, ret.) at Mercer University School of Medicine as well as founding editor of ''Medical Sentinel'', the AAPS's journal, was involved in a gun control debate regarding the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]'s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). Faria and other critics felt the NCIPC's program on gun violence was biased against gun owners, and was part of a 'public health' political strategy by gun control advocates. They testified before a [[US House]] Subcommittee on Appropriations to that effect.<ref>Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1997: Testimony of members of Congress and other interested individuals and organizations.

==Legal activity==

=== Social Security ===
In 1975, AAPS went to court to block enforcement of a new [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] amendment that would monitor the treatment given [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] patients.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913792,00.html | title=Review for Doctors | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]] | date=1975-12-01 | accessdate=2007-02-14}}</ref>

=== AAPS v. Hillary Clinton ===
With several other groups, AAPS filed a lawsuit in 1993 against [[Hillary Clinton]] and Secretary of Health and Human Services [[Donna Shalala]] over closed-door meetings related to the [[1993 Clinton health care plan]]. The AAPS sued to gain access to the list of members of [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton's]] health care taskforce. Judge [[Royce C. Lamberth]] found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded $285,864 to the AAPS for legal costs; Lamberth also harshly criticized the Clinton administration and Clinton aide [[Ira Magaziner]] in his ruling.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E5DA1E3FF93AA25751C1A961958260 | title = Judge Rules Government Covered Up Lies on Panel | first = Robert | last = Pear | work = New York Times | date = December 19, 1997 | accessdate = January 3, 2008}}</ref> Subsequently, a federal appeals court overturned the award and the initial findings on the basis that Magaziner and the administration had not acted in bad faith.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE7DB1F38F936A1575BC0A96F958260 | title = Court Clears Clinton Aide In Lying Case | first = Neil | last = Lewis | work = New York Times | date = August 25, 1999 | accessdate = January 3, 2008}}</ref>

=== Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ===
The AAPS was involved in litigation against [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), arguing that it violates the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] by allowing government access to certain medical data without a warrant.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4345/is_10_29/ai_n28870223/|title=Physicians Sue to Block HIPAA Privacy Rule |last1=Peters|first1=Sally |date=October, 2001? |accessdate=2012-03-01}}</ref>  (Title II of HIPAA, known as the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers, and is intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the US's health care system by encouraging the widespread use of electronic data interchange in the health care system.)

=== Seizure of Rush Limbaugh's medical records ===
In 2004, AAPS filed a brief on behalf of conservative talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] in Florida's Fourth District Court of Appeal, opposing the seizure of his medical files in an investigation of [[Rush_Limbaugh#Prescription_drug_addiction|drug charges]] for Limbaugh's alleged misuse of prescription drugs.  The AAPS stated the seizure was a violation of state law and that 'It is not a crime for a patient to be in pain and repeatedly seek relief, and doctors should not be turned against patients they tried to help.'"<ref name="Erik M. Conway 2010, p.245"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/2/21/141518.shtml | title=Doctors Group: Limbaugh Medical Records Seizure Unlawful | publisher=[[NewsMax Media|NewsMax.com]] | date=2004-02-22 | accessdate=2007-02-14}}</ref>

=== Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) ===
On March 26, 2010 AAPS filed suit to invalidate the new health care bill.<ref>http://www.aapsonline.org/hhslawsuit/aaps-v-sebelius-03-26-2010.php</ref>

===Other cases===
In 2006 the group criticised what it called [[sham peer review]], claiming it was a device used to punish [[whistleblowers]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aapsonline.org/peerreview/epidemic.php | title=Sham Peer Review: A National Epidemic | author=Lawrence R.

==''Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons''==
The ''Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons'' (JPandS), until 2003 named the ''Medical Sentinel'',<ref name="AAPS website"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://haciendapublishing.com/medicalsentinel | title=Medical Sentinel | accessdate=2007-02-14}}</ref> is the journal of the association.  Its mission statement includes "… a commitment to publishing scholarly articles in defense of the practice of private medicine, the pursuit of integrity in medical research … Political correctness, dogmatism and orthodoxy will be challenged with logical reasoning, valid data and the scientific method."  The publication policy of the journal states that articles are subject to a double-blind [[peer-review]] process.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jpands.org/vol10no1/authors.pdf | title=Manuscript information for authors | publisher=JPandS website | accessdate=2007-02-14| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070221153136/http://www.jpands.org/vol10no1/authors.pdf| archivedate= February 21, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Leprosy error ===
In a 2005 article published in the ''Journal'', [[Madeleine Cosman]] argued that [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] were carriers of disease, and that immigrants and [[anchor baby|"anchor babies"]] were launching a "stealthy assault on [American] medicine."<ref name="cosman">[http://www.jpands.org/vol10no1/cosman.pdf Illegal Aliens and American Medicine], by [[Madeleine Cosman]]. Published in the ''Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons'', Spring 2005 (Vol. 10, No. 1, pp. 6–10).</ref> In the article, Cosman claimed that "Suddenly, in the past 3 years America has more than 7,000 cases of leprosy" because of illegal aliens.<ref name="cosman"/> The journal's [[leprosy]] claim was cited and repeated by [[Lou Dobbs]] as evidence of the dangers of illegal immigration.<ref name="npr-leprosy">[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10141647 Broken Borders?

However, publicly available statistics show that the 7,000 cases of leprosy occurred during the past 30 years, not the past three as Cosman claimed.<ref>[http://hrsa.gov/hansens/30yeartrend.htm New U.S. Reported Hansen's Disease (Leprosy) Cases by Year, 1976–2005], from the U.S. National Hansen's Disease (Leprosy) Program.

Krahenbuhl, director of the U.S. government's leprosy program, stated that there had been no significant increase in leprosy cases, and that "It [leprosy] is not a public health problem—that’s the bottom line."<ref name="nyt-leprosy"/> National Public Radio reported that the ''Journal'' article "had footnotes that did not readily support allegations linking a recent rise in leprosy rates to illegal immigrants."<ref name="npr-leprosy"/> The article's erroneous leprosy claim was pointed out by ''[[60 Minutes]]'',<ref name="60minutes-leprosy">[http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/i_video/main500251.shtml?id=2765343n Lou Dobbs' Opinion], from ''[[60 Minutes]]''.
