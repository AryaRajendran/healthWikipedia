'''Jack L. Paradise''' is a [[professor emeritus]] of [[pediatrics]] at [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/61277.php|title=Fluid In The Ear Does Not Impair Development In Children, Pittsburgh Ear Study Finds|date=January 24, 2007|publisher=Medical News Today|accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> and a leading researcher of the placement of [[tympanostomy tube]]s in children with persistent [[otitis media]].

==Research==
Paradise asserts that the common fear of developmental problems caused by persistent ear infections in children are unfounded. According to Paradise's research, for children up to 3 years old, "ear disease does not cause any developmental problems."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/parenting/04/18/ear.tubes/index.html|title=Researchers urge caution in using ear tube surgery|last=Rowland|first=Rhonda|date=April 18, 2001|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> The research asserts that if the insertion of tympanostomy tubes into a child's ear is delayed, there is "no effect on a child's performance on language tests and speech tests."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSB71164520070117|title=Ear tubes do not aid child development:study|last=Emery|first=Gene|date=January 17, 2007|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref>

In otherwise healthy children ages 9 to 11 who have persistent middle-ear effusion, a study led by Paradise concluded that "prompt insertion of tympanostomy tubes does not improve developmental outcomes."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=Jack|coauthors=Feldman HM, Campbell TF, Dollaghan CA, Rockette HE, Pitcairn DL, Smith CG, Colborn DK, Bernard BS, Kurs-Lasky M, Janosky JE, Sabo DL, O'Connor RE, Pelham WE Jr.|date=January 18, 2007|title=Tympanostomy Tubes and Developmental Outcomes at 9 to 11 Years of Age|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society|location=Massachusetts|volume=356|issue=3|pages=248â€“261|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/356/3/248|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa062980|pmid=17229952}}</ref>

==Impact on medical community==
According to the [[Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC]], Paradise's studies have helped to promote the use of strict criteria for [[tonsillectomy]] and [[adenoidectomy]]. The 78% decline in pediatric tonsillectomies in the [[United States]] between 1971 and 1996 has also been largely attributed to his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chp.edu/CHP/Paradise,+Jack+L.,+MD|title=Physician Profile: Jack L.
