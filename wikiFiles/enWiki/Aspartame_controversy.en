==Origins==

The controversy over aspartame safety originated in perceived irregularities in the aspartame approval process during the 1970s and early 1980s, including allegations of a [[revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] relationship between regulators and industry and claims that aspartame producer [[G. D. Searle & Company|G.D. Searle]] had withheld and falsified safety data. In 1996, the controversy reached a wider audience with a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' report<ref name=60minutes>{{cite news|work=[[60 Minutes]]|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5805190307148690830#|title=How Sweet Is It?|date=December 29, 1996|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> that discussed criticisms of the FDA approval process and concerns that aspartame could cause brain tumors in humans. The ''60 Minutes'' special stated that "aspartame's approval was one of the most contested in FDA history."<ref name=60minutes/>

Around the same time, a [[Usenet]] post was widely circulated under the pen name "Nancy Markle", creating the basis for a misleading and unverifiable hoax [[chain letter]] that was spread through the Internet.<ref name=urbanlegends>{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blasp.htm|title= Aspartame Warning|publisher=[[About.com]]}} – the Nancy Markle chain email.</ref> Numerous websites have spread the email's claims, which were not backed by scientific evidence, about safety issues purportedly linked to aspartame, including [[Gulf War Syndrome]] and [[lupus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Should You Sour on Aspartame?|url=http://www.tuftshealthletter.com/ShowArticle.aspx?rowId=347|publisher=Tufts University Health and Nutrition Letter|accessdate=February 4, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101224173306/http://tuftshealthletter.com/ShowArticle.aspx?rowId=347| archivedate= December 24, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

== USFDA approval ==
Aspartame was originally approved for use in dry foods in 1974 by then FDA Commissioner Alexander Schmidt after review by the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Searle had submitted 168 studies<ref name=GAO87/>{{Rp|20|date=May 2009}} on aspartame, including seven animal studies that were considered crucial by the FDA.<ref name=GAO87/>{{Rp|21|date=May 2009}} Soon afterwards, [[John Olney]], a professor of psychiatry and prominent critic of [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]], along with James Turner, a public-interest lawyer and author of an anti-food-additive book, filed a petition for a public hearing, citing safety concerns.<ref name=GAO87/>{{Rp|38|date=May 2009}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Cockburn A.|year=2007|title=Rumsfeld: His Rise, Fall, and Catastrophic Legacy|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2Di2D4R25bEC&printsec=frontcover#PPA63,M1|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-3574-4}}</ref>{{Rp|63–4|date=May 2009}} Other criticisms (presented in the 1996 ''60 Minutes'' special) of the Searle studies included assertions of unreported medical treatments that may have affected the study outcomes and discrepancies in the reported data.<ref name=60minutes/> Schmidt agreed, pending an investigation into alleged improprieties in safety studies for aspartame and several drugs.
<!-- Pulled for now, see below comment and talk page.  The [[United States Department of Justice]] instituted [[grand jury]] proceedings against Searle for fraud in one of its drug studies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} -->
In December 1975, the FDA placed a stay on the aspartame approval, preventing Searle from marketing aspartame.<ref name=GAO87/>{{Rp|28|date=May 2009}} The Searle studies were criticized by the FDA commissioner as "...&nbsp;at best&nbsp;... sloppy and suffering from "...&nbsp;a pattern of conduct which compromises the scientific integrity of the studies."<ref name=60minutes/>
<!--

There is a substantial difference between what we have stated ("...&nbsp;instituted [[grand jury]] proceedings" and "one"&nbsp;... "drug studies") and the following. The discrepancy needs to be cleared up:

"In response to the report, the F.D.A. asked the Justice Department to open a grand jury investigation into whether two of Searle's aspartame studies had been falsified or were incomplete. In a 33-page letter in 1977, Richard A. Merrill, the F.D.A.'s chief counsel at the time, recommended to Samuel K. Skinner, then the United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, that a grand jury investigate the company, which was based in the Chicago suburb of Skokie, for "concealing material facts and making false statements in reports of animal studies conducted to establish the safety of the drug Aldactone and the food additive aspartame."<br> A grand jury was never convened, however."<ref name=lowdown/>

-->

U.S. Attorney [[Samuel Skinner]] was requested to "open a grand jury investigation into whether two of Searle's aspartame studies had been falsified or were incomplete".<ref name=lowdown/> Skinner withdrew from the case when he was considering a job offer from the law firm [[Sidley & Austin]], Searle's Chicago-based law firm, a job he later took.<ref name=60minutes/> The investigation was delayed and eventually the [[statute of limitations]] on the charges against Searle expired<ref name=60minutes/> and a grand jury was never convened.<ref name=lowdown/>

In 1977 and 1978, an FDA task force and a panel of academic pathologists reviewed 15 aspartame studies by Searle, and concluded that, although there were major lapses in quality control, the resulting inconsistencies would not have affected the studies' conclusions.<ref name=GAO87/>{{Rp|4|date=May 2009}}  In 1980, a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) heard testimony from Olney and disagreed with his claims that aspartame could cause brain damage, including in the developing fetus.<ref name=GAO87/>{{Rp|40–41|date=May 2009}} The board decided that further study was needed on a postulated connection between aspartame and brain tumors, and revoked approval of aspartame.<ref name=GAO87/>{{Rp|47|date=May 2009}}

In 1981, FDA Commissioner [[Arthur Hull Hayes]] sought advice on the issue from a panel of FDA scientists and a lawyer. The panel identified errors underlying the PBOI conclusion that aspartame might cause brain tumors, and presented arguments both for and against approval.<ref name=GAO87/>{{Rp|53|date=May 2009}} Hayes approved the use of aspartame in dry foods. Hayes further justified his approval with a Japanese brain tumor study,<ref name=Ishii1981>{{cite journal |last1=Hiroyuki |first1=I |title=Incidence of brain tumors in rats fed aspartame |journal=[[Toxicology Letters]] |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=433–7 |year=1981 |pmid=7245229 |doi=10.1016/0378-4274(81)90089-8}}</ref> the results of which, the PBOI chairman later said, would have resulted in an "unqualified approval" from the PBOI panel.<ref name=FDA1996>[http://web.archive.org/web/20041128020903/www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/answers/ans00772.html FDA Statement on Aspartame], November 18, 1996</ref> Several objections followed, but all were denied.<ref name=GAO87/>{{Rp|13|date=May 2009}} In November 1983, a little more than a year after approving aspartame Hayes left the FDA and joined public-relations firm [[Burson-Marsteller]], Searle's public relations agency at the time, as a senior medical adviser.<ref name="GAO86"/>

The actions of Samuel Skinner, in taking a job with a law firm retained by Searle during an investigation into Searle, and Arthur Hull Hayes, in taking a job with Searle's public relations agency following aspartame's approval, fueled conspiracy theories.<ref name=lowdown/>

Because of the approval controversy, Senator [[Howard M. Metzenbaum]] requested an investigation by the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) of aspartame's approval. In 1987, the GAO reported that protocol had been followed and provided a time-line of events in the approval process.<ref name=GAO87>{{cite web | title = U.S. GAO – HRD-87-46 Food and Drug Administration: Food Additive Approval Process Followed for Aspartame, June 18, 1987 | accessdate = 2008-09-05 | url = http://www.gao.gov/docdblite/info.php?rptno=HRD-87-46 }}</ref>{{Rp|13|date=May 2009}} The GAO review included a survey of scientists who had conducted safety reviews; of the 67 scientists who responded to a questionnaire, 12 had major concerns about aspartame's safety, 26 were somewhat concerned but generally confident in aspartame safety, and 29 were very confident in aspartame safety.<ref name=GAO87/>{{Rp|16,76–81|date=May 2009}}

Food additive safety evaluations by many countries have led to approval of aspartame, citing the general lack of adverse effects following consumption in reasonable quantities.<ref name=FSANZ2>Food Standards Australia New Zealand: {{cite web |title=Food Standards Australia New Zealand: Aspartame – what it is and why it's used in our food |accessdate=2008-12-09|url= http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/consumers/chemicals-nutrients-additives-and-toxins/aspartame/|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081216093929/http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/consumers/chemicals-nutrients-additives-and-toxins/aspartame/|archivedate= 2008-12-16}}</ref> Based on government research reviews and recommendations from advisory bodies such as those listed above, aspartame has been found to be safe for human consumption by more than ninety countries worldwide.<ref name="Health Canada"/><ref name=FSANZ/>

==Alleged conflict of interest prior to 1996==
In 1976, the FDA notified then-U.S. attorney for Chicago, Sam Skinner, of the ongoing investigation of Searle, and in January 1977, formally requested that a grand jury be convened. In February, 1977, Searle's law firm, [[Sidley & Austin]] offered Skinner a job and Skinner recused himself from the case.<ref name=CongRec1989>{{cite journal|url= http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?r101:7:./temp/~r101nc8vPN:e1:|periodical=Congressional Record 101st congress 1st session |title=DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION|page=s832|volume=135|date=January 31, 1989|issue=8}}</ref> Mr. Skinner's successor was in place several months later, and the statute of limitations for the alleged offenses expired in October 1977. Despite complaints and urging from DOJ in Washington, neither the interim U.S. attorney for Chicago, William Conlon, nor Skinner's successor, Thomas Sullivan, convened a grand jury.<ref name=WSJ1986>{{cite news|title=Two Ex-U.S. Prosecutors' Roles in Case Against Searle Are Questioned in Probe|author=Andy Pasztor and Joe Davidson|periodical=Wall Street Journal|date=February 7, 1986}}</ref> In December, 1977, Sullivan ordered the case dropped for lack of evidence. A year and a half later, Conlon also was hired by Sidley & Austin.<ref name=lowdown/> Concern about conflict of interest in this case inflamed the controversy, and Senator Metzenbaum investigated in 1981 Senate Hearings.<ref name=GAO87 /> In 1989, the U.S. Senate approved the nomination of Sam Skinner to be Secretary of Transportation, noting that both Sullivan and Senator Metzenbaum had concluded that Skinner had not acted improperly.<ref name=CongRec1989 />

Ralph G. Walton, a psychologist at Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, stated in a self-published 1996 analysis of aspartame research that industry-funded studies found no safety concerns while 84 of 92 independent studies did identify safety concerns.<ref name=lowdown>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/business/yourmoney/12sweet.html?ei=5090&en=f5f173a4cc33d534&ex=1297400400&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all "The Lowdown on Sweet?"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 12, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/dec/15/foodanddrink.immigrationpolicy "Safety of artificial sweetener called into question by MP"] ''[[The Guardian]]'', December 15, 2005</ref> This analysis by Walton was submitted to the television show ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and has been extensively discussed on the Internet. An analysis of Walton's claims showed that Walton left out at least 50 peer-reviewed safety studies from his review of the literature and that most of the research he cites as non-industry funded were actually letters to the editors, case reports, review articles or book chapters rather than published studies.<ref name=Kotsonis>{{cite book |last1=Kotsonis |first1=Frank | last2= Mackey |first2= Maureen |title= Nutritional toxicology |edition= 2nd | year=2002 |isbn= 0-203-36144-X |page= 299}}</ref> In a rebuttal to Walton's statements, the Aspartame Information Service (a service provided by [[Ajinomoto]], a primary producer and supplier of aspartame), reviewed the publications Walton cites as critical of aspartame, arguing that most of them do not involve aspartame or do not draw negative conclusions, are not peer-reviewed, are anecdotal, or are duplicates.<ref>{{cite web | title=Aspartame Information replies to the New York Times | url=http://www.aspartame.info/news/aspartame_information_replies_to_the_new_york_times_(distributed_with_the_daily_telegraph).asp | publisher=Aspartame Information Service | date=2006-02-16 }}</ref>

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) commenced a re-evaluation of aspartame as part of the systematic re-evaluation of all food additives authorised in the EU prior to 20 January 2009.  In May 2011, EFSA was asked by the European Commission to bring forward the full re-evaluation of the safety of aspartame (E 951), which was previously planned for completion by 2020.<ref name=EFSA2013Jan>[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130108.htm EFSA Press Release January 8, 2013]</ref>  In September 2011, the EFSA made all 600 datasets it is using in its full re-evaluation available publicly. This includes previously unpublished scientific data, "including the 112 original studies on aspartame which were submitted to support the request for authorisation of aspartame in Europe in the early 1980s."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/dataclosed/call/110601.htm |title=EFSA Call: Call for scientific data on Aspartame (E 951) |first= |last= |work=efsa.europa.eu |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/EFSA-makes-aspartame-studies-available |title=EFSA makes aspartame studies available |work=foodnavigator.com |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/EFSA-delay-Aspartame-review-findings-until-2013 |title=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/EFSA-delay-Aspartame-review-findings-until-2013 |work= foodnavigator.com |date= August 8, 2012 |accessdate= August 14, 2012}}</ref> On January 8, 2013, the EFSA released its draft report, which found that aspartame and its metabolites "pose no toxicity concern for consumers at current levels of exposure.

==Ramazzini studies==
The Cesare Maltoni Cancer Research Center of the [[European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences]] has released several studies which claim that aspartame can increase several malignancies in rodents, concluding that aspartame is a potential carcinogen at normal dietary doses.<ref name=Magnuson/> Although thirteen [[occupational safety and health]] experts signed an open letter from CSPI to the FDA expressing that the 2007 ERF study merited a reevaluation of aspartame's safety in humans,<ref name=CSPItoFDA>{{cite journal |last1=Abdo |first1=KM |last2=Camargo Jr |first2=CA |last3=Davis |first3=D |last4=Egilman |first4=D |last5=Epstein |first5=SS |last6=Froines |first6=J |last7=Hattis |first7=D |last8=Hooper |first8=K |last9=Huff |first9=J |title=Letter to U.S. FDA commissioner.

After reviewing the foundation's claims, the EFSA<ref name=EFSAreport>{{cite journal |author=Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food |title=Opinion of the Scientific Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC) related to a new long-term carcinogenicity study on aspartame |journal=The EFSA Journal |year=2006 |volume=356 |pages=1–44 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2006.356}}</ref> and the FDA<ref name=FDAstatement/> discounted the study results and found no reason to revise their previously established acceptable daily intake levels for aspartame. Reported flaws were numerous and included, but were not limited to, the following: comparing cancer rates of older aspartame-consuming rats to younger control rats; unspecified composition of the "Corticella" diet and method of adding aspartame, leading to possible nutritional deficiencies; unspecified aspartame storage conditions; lack of animal randomization; overcrowding and a high incidence of possibly carcinogenic infections; and the U.S. [[National Toxicology Program]]'s finding that the ERF had misdiagnosed [[hyperplasia]]s as malignancies.<ref name=Magnuson/> Reviews by the FDA and EFSA were hampered by the refusal of the Ramazzini Foundation to release all data and pathology slides, but from the materials received, the FDA<ref name=FDAstatement>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/ucm208580.htm |title=US FDA/CFSAN – FDA Statement on European Aspartame Study |accessdate=September 23, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100923210555/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/ucm208580.htm| archivedate= September 23, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and EFSA<ref name=EFSAReview2>{{cite journal |author=Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food |title=Updated opinion on a request from the European Commission related to the 2nd ERF carcinogenicity study on aspartame, taking into consideration study data submitted by the Ramazzini Foundation in February 2009 |journal=The EFSA Journal |year=2009 |volume=1015 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1015}}</ref> found that the data did not support the researcher's published conclusions. Evaluation of this research by Health Canada<ref>{{cite web|title=Health Canada Comments on the Recent Study Relating to the Safety of Aspartame|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/addit/sweeten-edulcor/aspartame_statement-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}</ref> and the British government's Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement on a Carcinogenicity Study of Aspartame by the European Ramazzini Foundation|url=http://www.iacoc.org.uk/statements/documents/COC06S2AspartamestatementDec2006_000.pdf|publisher=Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}</ref> likewise found methodological problems with the research and did not recommend any further reconsideration of the recommended intake of aspartame in their respective countries.

A review of the literature concurred with these evaluations, finding many possible flaws in the study's design and conclusions. These conclusions are also contradicted by other carcinogenicity studies which found no significant danger.  This review therefore concluded this research did not constitute credible evidence for the carcinogenicity of aspartame.<ref name=Magnuson /> Another review criticized the Ramazzini Foundation for relying on "[[science by press conference]]" with its release of results through the media before being published in a proper [[peer-review]]ed journal, thus helping fuel the controversy and publicity about the study in the media.<ref name=Lofstedt>{{cite journal |last1= Lofstedt |first1= Ragnar E |authorlink= Ragnar Löfstedt |title=Risk Communication, Media Amplification and the Aspartame Scare |journal=Risk Management |volume=10 |pages=257–84 |year=2008 |doi=10.1057/rm.2008.11 }}</ref>

Another carcinogenicity study in rodents published by this foundation in 2010 was evaluated by the EFSA and was found to have multiple significant design flaws and could not be interpreted. The EFSA therefore concluded this study did not provide enough evidence to reconsider previous evaluation of aspartame safety.<ref>{{cite web|title=EFSA reviews two publications on the safety of artificial sweeteners|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/ans110228.htm|publisher=EFSA|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}</ref>
