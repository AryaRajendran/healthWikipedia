'''Hessam Nowzari''' is the Director of the [[University of Southern California]] Advanced [[Periodontics]] program, since 1995, and is a Diplomate of the [[American Board of Periodontology]].

==Biography==
Hessam Nowzari was the youngest director at the University of Southern California Advanced Periodontics program (1995-2012) where he established a program that mirror's Nowzari's stances on key issues in [[periodontology]]. Nowzari(Iranian) holds a PhD in [[Biology]] and Health Sciences and many international positions. His Symposium is one of very few in the US that does not have commercial exhibition of any kind.{nowzarisymposium.com} Nowzari is the founder of the [[Taipei]] Academy of Reconstructive Dentistry in [[Taiwan]] and one of only two American members of the Dnipropetrovsk State Academy of Medical Sciences in [[Ukraine]]. For the first time in the recent history of Israel, he was the first non-Jewish Iranian of a Persian heritage to be the keynote speaker at the Israel Dental Association Congress. The event was held in Tel Aviv on November 15 and 16, 2012, by far the largest dental event held in Israel (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hessam-nowzari/iran-and-israel-a-scientific-collaboration_b_2065768.html). He has served as a scientific expert on an international panel charged with assessing and ranking research proposals for the Ministry of Education and Research, section of medical engineering, in [[Italy]]. He has been elected to the Italian Board of Experts for evaluating medical products for patient safety and health integrity. In 2oo2, he joined the National Institute of Transplantation (NIT) to study the relationship between periodontal disease and transplant complications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/update/november02/research01.htm |title=Welcome to the USC School of Dentistry Website |publisher=Usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref> He is also an editor of one of the leading reference publications, Aesthetic Periodontal Therapy: Periodontology 2000.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hessam Nowzari |url=http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/experts/787.html |title=USC Experts Directory: Hessam Nowzari |publisher=Usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref>.  His research interests are continued by his students,  Rafiel M. Rafiee, Kian Kar, and Arnoosh Safarian
Didactically, known for his emphasis on the relationship between periodontics and prosthodontics. He also established a periodontic/orthodontic course at the University of Southern California. Its biological research stresses the role of [[viruses]], mainly the [[herpes]] virus family, in [[periodontal disease]]. Surgically, it is known for its position against using animal or human cadaver products in bone or soft tissue augmentation due to their potential for contamination of the surgical site. Nowzari is known for his advocacy against early in life periodontal disease (aggressive periodontitis).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nowzari |first1=H |last2=Botero |first2=JE |last3=Rich |first3=SK |title=The impact of early-in-life periodontal infection on the smiles of children: a worldwide view |journal=Compendium of continuing education in dentistry |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=154, 156–8, 160 passim |year=2010 |pmid=20344901}}</ref> In an effort to bring international attention to this cause, he made the movie "The Enemy of the Smile: AA - An Ancient Bacterium" which debuts in 2010.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1705055/ The Enemy of the Smile: AA - An Ancient Bacterium] IMBD.com</ref> Dr. Nowzari’s current movie is entitled: “What Killed The Smile of Hatshepsut, A Woman Who Was A Pharaoh? That won Award of Merit 2012, Short Documentary, from "The Accolade Competition" that honors outstanding craft and creativity in film, television, and videography. Gore Vidal, the American literary lion and Hessam Nowzari did 2 broadcast interviews on this topic:(http://www.filmfestivals.com/blog/quendrith_johnson/exclusive_interview_gore_vidal_friend_of_the_country_champions_the_enemy_of_the_smile).He is the organizer of Nowzari Symposiums in Beverly Hills : nowzarisymposium.com.

In 1994, Nowzari challenged membrane guided tissue regeneration through a series of research publications, showing that the membrane is actually a source of infection to the grafted site.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nowzari |first1=H |last2=Slots |first2=J |title=Microbiologic and clinical study of polytetrafluoroethylene membranes for guided bone regeneration around implants |journal=The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=67–73 |year=1995 |pmid=7615319}}</ref>
