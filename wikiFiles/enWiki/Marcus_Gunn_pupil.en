'''Marcus Gunn pupil''' or '''relative afferent pupillary defect''' ('''RAPD''') is a [[medical sign]] observed during the [[swinging-flashlight test]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://umed.med.utah.edu/neuronet/lectures/2002/Basics%20in%20Neuro-Ophthalmology.htm |title=utah.edu |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref> whereupon the patient's [[pupils]] constrict less (therefore appearing to dilate) when a bright light is swung from the unaffected eye to the affected eye. The affected eye still senses the light and produces pupillary sphincter constriction to some degree, albeit reduced.

The most common cause of Marcus Gunn pupil is a [[lesion]] of the [[optic nerve]] (between the retina and the [[optic chiasm]]) or severe [[retina]]l disease. It is named after [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[ophthalmologist]] [[Robert Marcus Gunn]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|2687}}</ref>

==Examination==
The Marcus Gunn pupil is a relative afferent pupillary defect indicating a decreased pupillary response to light in the affected eye.<ref name="pmid8937350">{{cite journal |author=Pearce J |title=The Marcus Gunn pupil |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=520 |year=1996 |month=November |pmid=8937350 |pmc=1074053 |doi= 10.1136/jnnp.61.5.520|url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8937350}}</ref>

In the [[swinging flashlight test]], a light is alternately shone into the left and right eyes.  A normal response would be equal constriction of both pupils, regardless of which eye the light is directed at.  This indicates an intact direct and consensual [[pupillary light reflex]].  When the test is performed in an eye with an afferent pupillary defect, light directed in the affected eye will cause only mild constriction of both pupils (due to decreased response to light from the afferent defect), while light in the unaffected eye will cause a normal constriction of both pupils (due to an intact afferent path, and an intact consensual pupillary reflex).  Thus, light shone in the affected eye will produce less pupillary constriction than light shone in the unaffected eye.

A Marcus Gunn Pupil is distinguished from a total [[CN II]] lesion, in which the affected eye perceives ''no'' light.  In that case, shining the light in the affected eye produces no effect.

[[Anisocoria]] is absent.  A Marcus Gunn pupil is seen, among other conditions, in [[optic neuritis]]. It is also common in retrobulbar optic neuritis due to [[multiple sclerosis]] but only for 3-4 weeks, until the visual acuity begins to improve in 1â€“2weeks and may return to normal. <ref> Mumenthaler Neurology 4ed, Thieme 2004, page 486 Demyelinating diseases </ref>
