A '''suture''' is a type of [[fibrous joint]] which only occurs in the [[Human skull|skull]] (or "cranium"). They are bound together by [[Sharpey's fibres]]. A tiny amount of movement is permitted at sutures, which contributes to the [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]] and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the skull.

These joints are [[synarthroses]].<ref name="titleModule - Introduction to Joints">{{cite web |url=http://anatomy.med.umich.edu/modules/joints_module/joints_05.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071217080425/http://anatomy.med.umich.edu/modules/joints_module/joints_05.html |archivedate=2007-12-17 |title=Module - Introduction to Joints |accessdate=2008-01-29 |work=}}</ref>

It is normal for many of the bones of the skull to remain unfused at birth. The fusion of the skull's bones at birth is known as [[craniosynostosis]]. The term "[[fontanelle]]" is used to describe the resulting "soft spots". The relative positions of the bones continue to change during the life of the adult (though less rapidly), which can provide useful information in [[forensics]] and [[archaeology]]. In old age, cranial sutures may ossify (turn to bone) completely.{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}

The joint between the mandible and the cranium, the [[temporomandibular joint]], forms the only non-sutured joint in the skull.

==List of sutures==
Most sutures are named for the bones they articulate, but some have special names of their own.

===Primarily visible from the side (norma lateralis)===
*[[Coronal suture]] - between the [[Frontal bone|frontal]] and [[parietal bone]]s
*[[Lambdoid suture]] - between the [[parietal bone|parietal]] and [[occipital bone|occipital]] bones and continuous with the occipitomastoid suture
*[[Occipitomastoid suture]] - between the [[occipital bone|occipital]] and [[temporal bone|temporal]] bones and continuous with the lambdoid suture
*[[Parietomastoid suture]]
*[[Sphenofrontal suture]]
*[[Sphenoparietal suture]]
*[[Sphenosquamosal suture]]
*[[Sphenozygomatic suture]]
*[[Squamosal suture]] - between the parietal and the [[temporal bone]]
*[[Zygomaticotemporal suture]]
*[[Zygomaticofrontal suture]]

===Primarily visible from front (norma frontalis) or above (norma verticalis) ===
*[[Frontal suture]] / [[Metopic suture]] - between the two [[frontal bones]], prior to the fusion of the two into a single bone
*[[Sagittal suture]] - along the midline, between [[parietal bone]]s

===Primarily visible from below (norma basalis) or inside===
*[[Frontoethmoidal suture]]
*[[Petrosquamous suture]]
*[[Sphenoethmoidal suture]]
*[[Sphenopetrosal suture]]
