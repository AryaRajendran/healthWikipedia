'''Polycystic ovary syndrome''' ('''PCOS''') is one of the most common female [[endocrine]] disorders. PCOS is a complex, heterogeneous disorder of uncertain [[etiology]], but there is strong evidence that it can to a large degree be classified as a [[genetic disease]].<ref name=Fauser2011/><ref name=FertSter_molecular /><ref name=Endocrine_role />

PCOS produces symptoms in approximately 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age (12–45 years old). It is thought to be one of the leading causes of [[female subfertility]]<ref name="pmid18277353">{{cite journal |author=Goldenberg N, Glueck C |title=Medical therapy in women with polycystic [[ovary]] syndrome before and during pregnancy and lactation |journal=Minerva Ginecol |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=63–75 |year=2008 |pmid=18277353 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid18181085">{{cite journal |author=Boomsma CM, Fauser BC, Macklon NS |title=Pregnancy complications in women with polycystic ovary syndrome |journal=Semin.

The principal features are [[anovulation]], resulting in irregular [[menstruation]], [[amenorrhea]], ovulation-related infertility, and polycystic ovaries; excessive amounts or effects of [[androgen]]ic (masculinizing) hormones, resulting in [[acne]] and [[hirsutism]]; and [[insulin resistance]], often associated with [[obesity]], [[Type 2 diabetes]], and [[hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol levels]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Polycystic ovary syndrome|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001408/}}</ref>   The symptoms and severity of the syndrome vary greatly among affected women.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Common symptoms of PCOS include:
* '''[[Menstrual disorder]]s:'''  PCOS mostly produces [[oligomenorrhea]] (few menstrual periods) or [[amenorrhea]] (no menstrual periods), but other types of menstrual disorders may also occur.<ref name=BMC_Teede /><ref name=MayoClinic />
* '''[[Infertility]]''':<ref name=MayoClinic />  This generally results directly from chronic [[anovulation]] (lack of ovulation).<ref name=BMC_Teede />
* '''[[hyperandrogenism|High levels of masculinizing hormones]]''':  The most common signs are [[acne]] and [[hirsutism]] (male pattern of hair growth), but it may produce [[hypermenorrhea]] (very frequent menstrual periods) or other symptoms.<ref name=BMC_Teede /><ref name=AMN>{{cite web |author=Christine Cortet-Rudelli, Didier Dewailly

The genetic component appears to be inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion with high [[genetic penetrance]] but variable [[expressivity]] in females; this means that each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the predisposing genetic variant(s) from a parent, and if a daughter receives the variant(s), then the daughter will have the disease to some extent.<ref name=FertSter_molecular /><ref name="pmid11212071" /><ref name=AnnNYAS_thoughts /><ref name=OMIM />  The genetic variant(s) can be inherited from either the father or the mother, and can be passed along to both sons (who may be asymptomatic carriers or may have symptoms such as early [[baldness]] and/or excessive hair) and daughters, who will show signs of PCOS.<ref name="pmid11212071">{{cite journal

The clinical severity of PCOS symptoms appears to be largely determined by factors such as obesity.<ref name=Endocrine_role /><ref name=BMC_Teede />

== Diagnosis ==
Not all women with PCOS have polycystic ovaries (PCO), nor do all women with ovarian cysts have PCOS; although a [[pelvic ultrasound]] is a major diagnostic tool, it is not the only one.<ref name=emedicine_imaging /> The diagnosis is straightforward using the Rotterdam criteria, even when the syndrome is associated with a wide range of symptoms.

=== Definition ===
Two definitions are commonly used:

==== NIH ====
: In 1990 a consensus workshop sponsored by the [[NIH]]/[[NICHD]] suggested that a patient has PCOS if she has all of the following:<ref name=emedicine_main>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/256806-overview#showall|title=Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome|author=Richard Scott Lucidi|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011|publisher=[[eMedicine]]}}</ref>
# [[oligoovulation]]
# signs of [[androgen excess]] (clinical or biochemical)
# other entities are excluded that would cause polycystic ovaries

==== Rotterdam ====
: In 2003 a consensus workshop sponsored by [[ESHRE]]/[[ASRM]] in [[Rotterdam]] indicated PCOS to be present if any 2 out of 3 criteria are met<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16418211 | doi=10.1210/jc.2005-2153 | volume=91 | issue=3 | journal = Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism | year=2006 | title = Diagnosis of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: The Rotterdam Criteria Are Premature | month=March | pages=781–785 | author=Azziz R}}</ref>
# [[oligoovulation]] and/or [[anovulation]]
# excess androgen activity
# polycystic ovaries (by [[gynecologic ultrasound]])
Other entities are excluded that would cause these.<ref name=BMC_Teede /><ref name=HumRep_Rotterdam>{{cite journal|pmid=14688154|doi=10.1093/humrep/deh098|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/1/41.long|journal=Human Reproduction|volume=19|issue=1|pages=41–47|year=2004|accessdate=14 November 2011|author=The Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM‐sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group|title=Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and long‐term health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)}}</ref>

The Rotterdam definition is wider, including many more patients, most notably patients without androgen excess. Critics say that findings obtained from the study of patients with androgen excess cannot necessarily be extrapolated to patients without androgen excess.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 14973405 | volume=56 | issue=1 | journal = Minerva ginecologica | year=2004 | title = Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome: from NIH criteria to ESHRE-ASRM guidelines. | month=February | pages=1–6 | author=Carmina E}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15380140 | doi=10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2004.05.001 | volume=18 | issue=5 | journal = Best Practice & Research Clinical Obstetrics & Gynaecology | year=2004 | title = Definitions, prevalence and symptoms of polycystic ovaries and polycystic ovary syndrome | month=October | pages=671–83 | author=Hart R, Hickey M, Franks S}}</ref>

;Androgen Excess PCOS Society
: In 2006 the Androgen Excess PCOS Society suggested a tightening of the diagnostic criteria to all of:<ref name=BMC_Teede />
# excess androgen activity
# oligoovulation/anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries
# other entities are excluded that would cause excess androgen activity

=== Standard diagnostic assessments ===
* History-taking, specifically for menstrual pattern, obesity, hirsutism, and the absence of breast development. A [[clinical prediction rule]] found that these four questions can diagnose PCOS with a [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 77.1% (95% [[confidence interval]] [CI] 62.7%–88.0%) and a [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 93.8% (95% CI 82.8%–98.7%).<ref name="pmid17872783">{{cite journal |author=Pedersen SD, Brar S, Faris P, Corenblum B |title=Polycystic ovary syndrome: validated questionnaire for use in diagnosis |journal=Canadian Family Physician |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=1042–7, 1041 |year=2007 |pmid=17872783 |doi=|url=http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/content/full/53/6/1041#T50531041 |pmc=1949220}}&nbsp;– see [http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/content/full/53/6/1041/T50531041 Table 5 Clinical tool for diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome]</ref>
* [[Gynecologic ultrasonography]], specifically looking for small [[ovarian follicles]]. These are believed to be the result of disturbed ovarian function with failed ovulation, reflected by the infrequent or absent menstruation that is typical of the condition. In a normal [[menstrual cycle]], one egg is released from a dominant follicle&nbsp;– essentially a cyst that bursts to release the egg. After ovulation the follicle remnant is transformed into a [[progesterone]]-producing [[corpus luteum]], which shrinks and disappears after approximately 12–14 days. In PCOS, there is a so called "follicular arrest", i.e., several follicles develop to a size of 5–7&nbsp;mm, but not further. No single follicle reaches the preovulatory size (16&nbsp;mm or more). According to the Rotterdam criteria, 12 or more small follicles should be seen in an ovary on ultrasound examination.<ref name=emedicine_main /> The follicles may be oriented in the periphery, giving the appearance of a 'string of pearls'. The numerous follicles contribute to the increased size of the ovaries, that is, 1.5 to 3 times larger than normal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
* [[laparoscopic surgery|Laparoscopic]] examination may reveal a thickened, smooth, pearl-white outer surface of the ovary. (This would usually be an incidental finding if laparoscopy were performed for some other reason, as it would not be routine to examine the ovaries in this way to confirm a diagnosis of PCOS.){{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
* Serum (blood) levels of [[androgen]]s (male hormones), including [[androstenedione]] and [[testosterone]] may be elevated.<ref name=BMC_Teede /> [[Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]] levels above 700-800mcg/dL are highly suggestive of adrenal dysfunction because DHEA-S is made exclusively by the adrenal glands.<ref name="pmid18844715">{{cite journal |author=Somani N, Harrison S, Bergfeld WF |title=The clinical evaluation of hirsutism |journal=Dermatologic therapy |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=376–91 |year=2008 |pmid=18844715 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8019.2008.00219.x}}</ref><ref name=emedicine_workup>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/256806-workup#showall|title=Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Workup|publisher=[[eMedicine]]|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> The free testosterone level is thought to be the best measure,<ref name=emedicine_workup /><ref name="pmid17603706">{{cite journal |author=Sharquie KE, Al-Bayatti AA, Al-Ajeel AI, Al-Bahar AJ, Al-Nuaimy AA |title=Free testosterone, luteinizing hormone/follicle stimulating hormone ratio and pelvic sonography in relation to skin manifestations in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome |journal=Saudi Med J |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=1039–43 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17603706 |doi= |url=}}</ref> with ~60% of PCOS patients demonstrating supranormal levels.<ref name=huang>{{cite journal |author=Huang A, Brennan K, Azziz R |title=Prevalence of hyperandrogenemia in the polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosed by the National Institutes of Health 1990 criteria |journal=Fertil.

* Some other blood tests are suggestive but not diagnostic. The ratio of LH ([[Luteinizing hormone]]) to FSH ([[Follicle stimulating hormone]]), when measured in [[international unit]]s, is greater than 1:1 (sometimes more than 3:1),<ref name=emedicine_workup /> as tested on Day 3 of the menstrual cycle.

=== Common assessments for associated conditions or risks ===
* Fasting biochemical screen and lipid profile<ref name=emedicine_workup />
* 2-hour oral [[glucose tolerance test]] (GTT) in patients with risk factors (obesity, family history, history of gestational diabetes)<ref name=BMC_Teede /> may indicate impaired glucose tolerance (insulin resistance) in 15–33% of women with PCOS.<ref name=emedicine_workup /> Frank diabetes can be seen in 65–68% of women with this condition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011|reason=Also, which criteria is this using? NIH or Rotterdam?}} Insulin resistance can be observed in both normal weight and overweight patients, although it is more common in the latter (and in those matching the stricter NIH criteria for diagnosis); 50–80% of PCOS patients may have insulin resistance at some level.<ref name=BMC_Teede />
* Fasting insulin level or GTT with insulin levels (also called IGTT). Elevated insulin levels have been helpful to predict response to medication and may indicate women who will need higher dosages of metformin or the use of a second medication to significantly lower insulin levels. Elevated [[blood sugar]] and insulin values do not predict who responds to an insulin-lowering medication, low-glycemic diet, and exercise. Many women with normal levels may benefit from combination therapy. A hypoglycemic response in which the two-hour insulin level is higher and the blood sugar lower than fasting is consistent with insulin resistance. A mathematical derivation known as the HOMAI, calculated from the fasting values in glucose and insulin concentrations, allows a direct and moderately accurate measure of insulin sensitivity (glucose-level x insulin-level/22.5).{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*[[Glucose tolerance test]]ing (GTT) instead of fasting glucose can increase diagnosis of increased glucose tolerance and frank diabetes among patients with PCOS according to a prospective controlled trial.<ref name="pmid9920077">{{cite journal |author=Legro RS, Kunselman AR, Dodson WC, Dunaif A |title=Prevalence and predictors of risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance in polycystic ovary syndrome: a prospective, controlled study in 254 affected women |journal=J.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Other causes of irregular or absent menstruation and hirsutism, such as  [[hypothyroidism]], [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (21-hydroxylase deficiency), [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[hyperprolactinemia]], androgen secreting neoplasms, and other pituitary or adrenal disorders, should be investigated.<ref name=BMC_Teede /><ref name=HumRep_Rotterdam /><ref name=emedicine_workup /> PCOS has been reported in other insulin-resistant situations such as [[acromegaly]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Pathogenesis ==
Polycystic ovaries develop when the ovaries are stimulated to produce excessive amounts of male hormones (androgens), particularly testosterone, by either one or a combination of the following (almost certainly combined with genetic susceptibility<ref name=AnnNYAS_thoughts />):
*the release of excessive [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) by the anterior pituitary gland{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*through high levels of insulin in the blood (hyperinsulinaemia) in women whose ovaries are sensitive to this stimulus<ref name=MayoClinic>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/DS00423/METHOD=print&DSECTION=all|author=Mayo Clinic Staff|publisher=Mayo Clinic|work=MayoClinic.com|title=Polycystic Ovary Syndrome&nbsp;– All|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref>
Alternatively or as well, reduced levels of sex-hormone binding globulin can result in increased free androgens.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The syndrome acquired its most widely used name due to the common sign on ultrasound examination of multiple (poly) ovarian [[cyst]]s. These "cysts" are actually immature [[ovarian follicle|follicles]], not cysts ("polyfollicular ovary syndrome" would have been a more accurate name). The follicles have developed from primordial follicles, but the development has stopped ("arrested") at an early antral stage due to the disturbed ovarian function. The follicles may be oriented along the ovarian periphery, appearing as a 'string of pearls' on ultrasound examination.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Women with PCOS have higher GnRH, which in turn results in an increase in LH/FSH ratio in women with PCOS.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21528473</ref>

A majority of patients with PCOS have insulin resistance and/or are obese. Their elevated insulin levels contribute to or cause the abnormalities seen in the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis]] that lead to PCOS. Hyperinsulinemia increases [[GnRH]] pulse frequency, LH over FSH dominance, increased ovarian androgen production,<ref name=MayoClinic /> decreased follicular maturation, and decreased [[SHBG]] binding; all these steps contribute to the development of PCOS.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Insulin resistance is a common finding among patients of normal weight as well as overweight patients.<ref name=BMC_Teede /><ref name=FertSter_insulin />

In many cases PCOS is characterised by a complex positive feedback loop of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. In most cases it can not be determined which (if any) of those two should be regarded causative. Experimental treatment with either antiandrogens or insulin sensitizing agents improves both hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Adipose tissue possesses [[aromatase]], an enzyme that converts androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol. The excess of adipose tissue in obese patients creates the paradox of having both excess androgens (which are responsible for hirsutism and [[virilization]]) and estrogens (which inhibits FSH via negative feedback).<ref>Kumar Cotran Robbins: Basic Pathology 6th ed. / Saunders 1996</ref>

PCOS may be associated with chronic inflammation,<ref name=MayoClinic /><ref name=Mediators_Inflammation>{{cite journal|author=Thozhukat Sathyapalan|coauthors=Stephen L.

It has previously been suggested that the excessive androgen production in PCOS could be caused by a decreased serum level of [[IGFBP-1]], in turn increasing the level of free [[IGF-I]] which stimulates ovarian androgen production, but recent data concludes this mechanism to be unlikely.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq027}}</ref>

PCOS has also been associated with a specific [[FMR1]] sub-genotype. The research suggests that women who have ''heterozygous-normal/low'' FMR1 have polycystic-like symptoms of excessive follicle-activity and hyperactive ovarian function.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gleicher N, Weghofer A, Lee IH, Barad DH |year=2010|title=FMR1 Genotype with Autoimmunity-Associated Polycystic Ovary-Like Phenotype and Decreased Pregnancy Chance|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=5|issue=12|page=e15303|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0015303|editor1-last=Mailund|editor1-first=Thomas}}</ref>

== Management ==
Medical treatment of PCOS is tailored to the patient's goals. Broadly, these may be considered under four categories:
* Lowering of insulin levels
* Restoration of fertility
* Treatment of [[hirsutism]] or acne
* Restoration of regular menstruation, and prevention of [[endometrial hyperplasia]] and [[endometrial cancer]]

In each of these areas, there is considerable debate as to the optimal treatment. One of the major reasons for this is the lack of large scale clinical trials comparing different treatments. [[Sample (statistics)|Smaller trials]] tend to be [[Sampling error|less reliable]] and hence may produce conflicting results.

General interventions that help to reduce weight or insulin resistance can be beneficial for all these aims, because they address what is believed to be the underlying cause.

=== Diet ===
Where PCOS is associated with overweight or obesity, successful weight loss is the most effective method of restoring normal ovulation/menstruation, but many women find it very difficult to achieve and sustain significant weight loss. [[Low-carbohydrate diet]]s and sustained regular exercise<ref name=emedicine_treatment /> may help.<!-- Supported by http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2173.htm as given in infobox --> Some experts recommend a [[low GI diet]] in which a significant part of total carbohydrates are obtained from fruit, vegetables and whole grain sources.<ref name=MayoClinic /><ref name="pmid16115348">{{cite journal |author=Marsh K, Brand-Miller J |title=The optimal diet for women with polycystic ovary syndrome? |journal=Br.

Nutr. |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=154–65 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16115348 |doi= 10.1079/BJN20051475|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0007114505001674}}</ref> [[Vitamin D deficiency]] may play some role in the development of the [[metabolic syndrome]],<ref name=emedicine_treatment /> so treatment of any such deficiency is indicated.

=== Medications ===
Reducing insulin resistance by improving insulin sensitivity through medications such as [[metformin]], and the newer [[thiazolidinedione]] (glitazones), have been an obvious approach and initial studies seemed to show effectiveness.<ref name=MayoClinic /><ref name=emedicine_treatment /><ref name=Lord>{{cite journal |author=Lord JM, Flight IHK, Norman RJ |title=Metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |year=2003 |volume=327 |issue=7421 |pages=951–3 |pmid=14576245 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/327/7421/951 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7421.951 |pmc=259161}}</ref> Although metformin is [[Off-label use|not licensed]] for use in PCOS, the United Kingdom's [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a [[body mass index]] above 25 be given metformin when other therapy has failed to produce results.<ref name="NICE2004">{{NICE | 11 | Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems | 2004}}</ref> However subsequent reviews in 2008 and 2009 have noted that [[randomised control trial]]s have in general not shown the promise suggested by the early [[observational studies]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Balen A |title=Metformin therapy for the management of infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome |work=Scientific Advisory Committee Opinion Paper 13 |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |date=December 2008 |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/SAC13metformin-minorrevision.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-12-13}}</ref><ref name="pmid19697191">{{cite journal |author=Leeman L, Acharya U |title=The use of metformin in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome and associated anovulatory infertility: the current evidence |journal=J Obstet Gynaecol |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=467–72 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19697191 |doi=10.1080/01443610902829414 |url=}}</ref>

=== Infertility ===
{{Main|Infertility in polycystic ovary syndrome}}
Not all women with PCOS have difficulty becoming pregnant. For those who do, [[anovulation]] or infrequent ovulation is a common cause. Other factors include changed levels of [[gonadotropin]]s, [[hyperandrogenemia]] and [[hyperinsulinemia]].<ref name=Qiao2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq032}}</ref> Like women without PCOS, women with PCOS who are ovulating may be infertile due to other causes, such as tubal blockages due to a history of sexually transmitted diseases.

For overweight, anovulatory women with PCOS, [[weight loss]] and diet adjustments, especially to reduce the intake of simple carbohydrates, are associated with resumption of natural ovulation.

For those who after weight loss still are anovulatory or for anovulatory lean women, then the ovulation-inducing medications [[clomiphene citrate]]<ref name=emedicine_treatment /> and [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] are the principal treatments used to promote ovulation.<ref name=MayoClinic />  Previously, the anti-diabetes medication metformin was recommended treatment for anovulation,<ref name=MayoClinic /> but it appears less effective than clomiphene.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Legro RS, Barnhart HX, Schlaff WD |title=Clomiphene, Metformin, or Both for Infertility in the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=356 |issue=6 |pages=551–66 |year=2007 |pmid=17287476 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa063971}}</ref>

For patients who do not respond to clomiphene, diet and lifestyle modification, there are options available including [[assisted reproductive technology]] procedures such as [[controlled ovarian hyperstimulation]] with [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) injections followed by [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF).

Though surgery is not commonly performed, the polycystic ovaries can be treated with a laparoscopic procedure called "ovarian drilling" (puncture of 4–10 small follicles with electrocautery, laser, or biopsy needles), which often results in either resumption of spontaneous ovulations<ref name=emedicine_treatment /> or ovulations after adjuvant treatment with clomiphene or FSH.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (Ovarian wedge resection is no longer used as much due to complications such as [[adhesions]] and the presence of frequently effective medications.) There are, however, concerns about the long-term effects of ovarian drilling on ovarian function.<ref name=emedicine_treatment />

=== Hirsutism and acne ===
{{Details|Hirsutism}}
When appropriate (e.g. in women of child-bearing age who require contraception), a standard contraceptive pill is frequently effective in reducing hirsutism.<ref name=MayoClinic /><ref name=emedicine_treatment /> A common choice of contraceptive pill is one that contains [[cyproterone acetate]]; in the UK the available brands are Dianette/Diane. Cyproterone acetate is a [[progestogen]] with anti-[[androgen]] effects that block the action of male hormones that are believed to contribute to acne and the growth of unwanted facial and body hair.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} On the other hand, progestogens such as norgestrel and levonorgestrel should be avoided due to their androgenic effects.<ref name=emedicine_treatment />

Other drugs with anti-androgen effects include [[flutamide]]<ref name=flutamide>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Polycystic-ovarian-syndrome/Pages/Treatment.aspx|title=Polycystic ovary syndrome&nbsp;– Treatment|publisher=National Health Service|location=United Kingdom|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> and [[spironolactone]],<ref name=MayoClinic /><ref name=emedicine_treatment /> which can give some improvement in hirsutism. Spironolactone is probably the most-commonly used drug in the US. Metformin can reduce hirsutism, perhaps by reducing insulin resistance, and is often used if there are other features such as insulin resistance, diabetes or obesity that should also benefit from metformin. [[Eflornithine]] (Vaniqa) is a drug which is applied to the skin in cream form, and acts directly on the hair follicles to inhibit hair growth. It is usually applied to the face.<ref name=emedicine_treatment /> Medications that reduce acne by indirect hormonal effects also include ergot dopamine agonists such as [[bromocriptine]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[5-alpha reductase]] inhibitors (such as [[finasteride]] and [[dutasteride]]) may also be used;<ref name=emedicine_medications>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/256806-medication#showall|title=Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Medication|publisher=eMedicine|author=Richard Scott Lucidi|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> they work by blocking the conversion of [[testosterone]] to [[dihydrotestosterone]] (the latter of which is responsible for most hair growth alterations and androgenic acne).

Although these agents have shown significant efficacy in clinical trials (for oral contraceptives, in 60–100% of individuals<ref name=emedicine_treatment />), the reduction in hair growth may not be enough to eliminate the social embarrassment of hirsutism, or the inconvenience of plucking or shaving. Individuals vary in their response to different therapies.  It is usually worth trying other drug treatments if one does not work, but drug treatments do not work well for all individuals. For removal of facial hairs, electrolysis or laser treatments are&nbsp;– at least for some&nbsp;– faster and more efficient alternatives than the above mentioned medical therapies.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

=== Menstrual irregularity and endometrial hyperplasia ===
If fertility is not the primary aim, then [[menstruation]] can usually be regulated with a contraceptive pill.<ref name=MayoClinic /><ref name=emedicine_treatment>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/256806-treatment#showall|title=Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Treatment & Management|publisher=[[eMedicine]]|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> The purpose of regulating menstruation is essentially for the woman's convenience, and perhaps her sense of well-being; there is no medical requirement for regular periods, so long as they occur sufficiently often.

If a regular menstrual cycle is not desired, then therapy for an irregular cycle is not necessarily required.  Most experts say that if a menstrual bleed occurs at least every three months, then the endometrium (womb lining) is being shed sufficiently often to prevent an increased risk of endometrial abnormalities or cancer.<ref name=verity_risks>{{cite web|url=http://www.verity-pcos.org.uk/guide_to_pcos/what_is_pcos/health_risks|title=What are the health risks of PCOS?|work=Verity&nbsp;– PCOS Charity|publisher=Verity|year=2011|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref> If menstruation occurs less often or not at all, some form of progestogen replacement is recommended.<ref name=emedicine_medications /> An alternative is oral progestogen taken at intervals (e.g. every three months) to induce a predictable menstrual bleeding.<ref name=MayoClinic />

=== Alternative medicine ===
There is insufficient evidence to conclude an effect from [[D-chiro-inositol]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galazis|first=N|coauthors=Galazi, M; Atiomo, W|title=D-Chiro-inositol and its significance in polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review.|journal=Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology|date=2011 Apr|volume=27|issue=4|pages=256–62|pmid=21142777}}</ref> Myo-inosiol however appears to be effective.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Unfer|first=V|coauthors=Carlomagno, G; Dante, G; Facchinetti, F|title=Effects of myo-inositol in women with PCOS: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.|journal=Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology|date=2012 Jul|volume=28|issue=7|pages=509–15|pmid=22296306}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==
Women with PCOS are at risk for the following:
* [[Endometrial hyperplasia]] and [[endometrial cancer]] (cancer of the uterine lining) are possible, due to overaccumulation of uterine lining, and also lack of [[progesterone]] resulting in prolonged stimulation of uterine cells by estrogen.<ref name=MayoClinic /><ref name=emedicine_main /> It is not clear if this risk is directly due to the syndrome or from the associated obesity, [[hyperinsulinemia]], and [[hyperandrogenism]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1993.tb43866.x | pmid = 8323173 | volume=687 | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | year=1993 | issue = 1 Intraovarian | title = Nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia and the polycystic ovarian syndrome | month=May | pages=193–205 | author=New MI}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13409-5 | pmid = 12781553 | volume=361 | issue=9371 | journal = Lancet | year=2003 | title = Polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial carcinoma | month=May | pages=1810–2 | author=Hardiman P, Pillay OC, Atiomo W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0015-0282(99)00468-9 | pmid = 10632431 | volume=73 | issue=1 | journal = Fertility and Sterility | year=2000 | title = Hyperinsulinemia in polycystic ovary syndrome correlates with increased cardiovascular risk independent of obesity | month=January | pages=150–6 | author=Mather KJ, Kwan F, Corenblum B}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 18854802 | volume=60 | issue=5 | journal = Minerva ginecologica | year=2008 | title = Treatment of hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinemia in PCOS patients with essential amino acids.

Early diagnosis and treatment may reduce the risk of some of these, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.<ref name=MayoClinic />

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of PCOS depends on the choice of diagnostic criteria. The World Health Organization estimates that it effects 116&nbsp;million women worldwide as of 2010 (3.4% of the population).<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607}}</ref> One community-based prevalence study using the Rotterdam criteria found that about 18% of women had PCOS, and that 70% of them were previously undiagnosed.<ref name=BMC_Teede />

== History ==
The condition was first described in 1935 by American gynecologists Irving F. Stein, Sr. and Michael L. Leventhal, from whom its original name of ''Stein-Leventhal syndrome'' is taken.<ref name=emedicine_imaging>{{Cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/404754-overview|publisher=[[eMedicine]]|title=Imaging in Polycystic Ovary Disease|work=eMedicine|first=Greg|last=Marrinan|editor-first=Eugene C|editor-last=Lin|date=20 April 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=emedicine_main />

The earliest published description of a patient with what is now recognized as PCOS was in 1721 in Italy.<ref name="Kovacs2007">{{cite book|last1=Kovacs|first1=Gabor T.|last2=Norman|first2=Robert|title=Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bpn1u9hziVgC&pg=PA4|accessdate=29 March 2013|date=2007-02-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139462037|page=4}}</ref>  Cyst-related changes to the ovaries were described in 1844.<ref name="Kovacs2007" />
