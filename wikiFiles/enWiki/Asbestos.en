Asbestos became increasingly popular among manufacturers and builders in the late 19th century because of its sound absorption, average [[tensile strength]], its [[flame-retardant|resistance to fire]], heat, electrical and chemical damage, and affordability. It was used in such applications as [[electrical insulation]] for hotplate wiring and in [[building insulation]]. When asbestos is used for its resistance to fire or heat, the fibers are often mixed with cement (resulting in [[fiber cement]]) or woven into fabric or mats.

Asbestos mining began more than 4,000 years ago, but did not start large-scale until the end of the 19th century. For a long time, the world's largest asbestos mine was the Jeffrey mine in the town of [[Asbestos, Quebec]].<ref name="Book">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zNicdkuulE4C&pg=PA195|page=195 |title=Industrial minerals & rocks: commodities, markets, and uses |isbn=978-0-87335-233-8 |author1=Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration (U.S.)|date=5 March 2006}}</ref>

==Types and associated fibers==
[[File:Asbestos1USGOV.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysotile asbestos]]
[[File:Asbestos fibres.jpg|thumb|left|Asbestos fibers]]
Six minerals types are defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] as "asbestos" including those belonging to the serpentine class and those belonging to the amphibole class. All six asbestos mineral types are known to be human [[carcinogens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110429155522/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/eleventh/profiles/s016asbe.pdf|title=Asbestos, CAS No. 1332-21-4|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="epa2003">{{cite book|last=Berman|first=D Wayne|last2=Crump|first2=Kenny S|title=Final draft:technical support document for a protocol to assess asbestos-related risk|publisher =U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|year=2003|location=Washington DC|page=474}}</ref>

===Serpentine===
Serpentine class fibers are curly.  [[Chrysotile]] is the only member of the serpentine class.

====Chrysotile====
[[Chrysotile]], [[CAS registry number|CAS No.]] 12001-29-5, is obtained from [[serpentinite]] rocks which are common throughout the world. Its idealized [[chemical formula]] is [[Magnesium|Mg]]{{sub|3}}([[Silicon|Si]]{{sub|2}}[[Oxygen|O]]{{sub|5}})([[Hydroxide|OH]]){{sub|4}}.<ref name="qsqlui">{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/Pollution/asbestos?sitearea=PED|title=What is asbestos?|work=American Cancer Society|accessdate=2010-01-12}}</ref> Chrysotile appears under the microscope as a white fiber.

Chrysotile has been used more than any other type and accounts for about 95% of the asbestos found in buildings in America.<ref name=wdnr>{{cite web|title=Asbestos – History and Uses|date=31 August 2007|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071228042633/http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/aw/air/reg/asbestos/asbes3.htm |archivedate=28 December 2007}}</ref> Chrysotile is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can be spun and woven into fabric. Its most common use has been in corrugated asbestos cement roof sheets typically used for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found in sheets or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. Chrysotile has been a component in [[joint compound]] and some plasters.  Numerous other items have been made containing chrysotile, including brake linings, fire barriers in fuseboxes, pipe insulation, floor tiles, and rope seals for boilers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
.

===Amphibole===
Amphibole class fibers are needle-like. [[Amosite]], [[crocidolite]], [[tremolite]], [[anthophyllite]] and [[actinolite]] are members of the amphibole class.

====Amosite====
[[Amosite]], CAS No. 12172-73-5, is a [[trade name]] for the amphiboles belonging to the [[cummingtonite]]-[[grunerite]] [[solid solution]] series, commonly from South Africa, named as an [[acronym]] for "asbestos mines of South Africa". One formula given for amosite is [[iron|Fe]]<sub>7</sub>Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>22</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>.  Amosite is seen under a microscope as a brown fiber. It is found most frequently as a fire retardant in thermal insulation products and ceiling tiles.<ref name="wdnr"/>

====Crocidolite====
[[Crocidolite]], CAS No. 12001-28-4, is the fibrous form of the amphibole [[riebeckite]], found primarily in southern Africa, but also in Australia and Bolivia. One formula given for crocidolite is [[sodium|Na]]<sub>2</sub>Fe<sup>2+</sup><sub>3</sub>Fe<sup>3+</sup><sub>2</sub>Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>22</sub>([[hydroxyl|OH]])<sub>2</sub>.  Crocidolite is seen under a microscope as a blue fiber.

[[Crocidolite]] commonly occurs as soft [[friability|friable]] fibers. Asbestiform amphibole may also occur as soft friable fibers but some varieties such as amosite are commonly straighter. All forms of asbestos are fibrillar in that they are composed of fibers with breadths less than 1 [[micrometre|micrometer]] that occur in bundles and have very great widths. Asbestos with particularly fine fibers is also referred to as "amianthus".

====Other materials====
Other regulated asbestos minerals, such as tremolite asbestos, CAS No. 77536-68-6, [[Calcium|Ca]]<sub>2</sub>Mg<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>22</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>; actinolite asbestos, CAS No. 77536-66-4, Ca<sub>2</sub>(Mg, Fe)<sub>5</sub>(Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>22</sub>)(OH)<sub>2</sub>; and anthophyllite asbestos, CAS No. 77536-67-5, (Mg, Fe)<sub>7</sub>Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>22</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>; are less commonly used industrially but can still be found in a variety of construction materials and insulation materials and have been reported in the past to occur in a few [[product (business)|consumer products]].

[[File:Epa 450 2-78-014 march 1978 asbestos comparison.JPG|thumb|Size of asbestos fibers compared to other particles (USEPA, March, 1978]]
Other natural and not currently regulated asbestiform minerals, such as [[richterite]], Na(CaNa)(Mg, Fe<sup>++</sup>)<sub>5</sub>(Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>22</sub>)(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and [[winchite]], (CaNa)Mg<sub>4</sub>(Al, Fe<sup>3+</sup>)(Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>22</sub>)(OH)<sub>2</sub>.  These minerals are thought by some to be no less harmful than tremolite, amosite, or crocidolite.<ref name="osha.gov">[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=PREAMBLES&p_id=782 1992 OSHA Amended Final Rule on Asbestos, Introduction]</ref>  They are referred to as "asbestiform" rather than asbestos.  Although the U.S. OSHA has not included them in the asbestos standard, NIOSH and the American Thoracic Society have recommended that they be included as regulated materials.  As such, they may still be related to diseases and hazardous.<ref name="osha.gov"/>

==Producing nations==
[[File:Asbestos output2.png|thumb|right|Asbestos output in 2005]]
In 2009, 2 million [[tonne]]s of asbestos were mined worldwide. Russia was the largest producer with about 50% world share followed by China (14%), Brazil (12.5%), Kazakhstan (10.5%) and Canada (9%).<ref>{{cite web|title=ASBESTOS|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/asbestos/mcs-2010-asbes.pdf}}</ref>

===Industrial era===
The U.S. asbestos industry began in 1858 when fibrous anthophyllite was mined for use as asbestos insulation by the Johns Company, a predecessor to the current Johns Manville at a quarry at Ward's Hill on Staten Island, New York.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Betts|first=John|title=The Minerals of New York City|url=http://www.johnbetts-fineminerals.com/jhbnyc/articles/nycminerals1.htm|journal=Rocks & Mineral Magazine|accessdate=21 April 2011|date= May/June 2009 |volume =84|issue=3 |pages= 204–252|doi=10.3200/RMIN.84.3.204-223}}</ref> Asbestos became more widespread during the industrial revolution; in 1866 it was used as insulation in the U.S. and Canada. Development of the first commercial asbestos mine began in 1874 in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] foothills of [[Quebec]].<ref>Udd, John (1998) [http://www.horton.ednet.ns.ca/staff/webb/geology/3Minerals/Chronology%20of%20Minerals%20in%20Canada.pdf "A Chronology of Minerals Development in Canada"] National Resources Canada</ref> By the mid 20th century uses included fire retardant coatings, concrete, bricks, pipes and fireplace cement, heat, fire, and acid resistant gaskets, pipe insulation, ceiling insulation, fireproof drywall, flooring, roofing, lawn furniture, and drywall joint compound.

In Japan, particularly after [[World War II]], asbestos was used in the manufacture of [[ammonium sulfate]] for purposes of rice production, sprayed upon the ceilings, iron skeletons, and walls of railroad cars and buildings (during the 1960s), and used for energy efficiency reasons as well. Production of asbestos in Japan peaked in 1974 and went through ups and downs until about 1990, when production began to drop severely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110719043338/http://www.hvbg.de/e/asbest/konfrep/konfrep/repbeitr/morinaga_en.pdf|author=Kenji Morinaga|work=European Conference 2003 |title=Asbestos in Japan |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-12}}</ref>

===Discovery of toxicity===

''For additional chronological citations, see also, [[List of asbestos disease medical articles]]''

The first documented death related to asbestos was in 1906.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In the early 1900s researchers began to notice a large number of early deaths and lung problems in asbestos mining towns. The first diagnosis of asbestosis was made in the UK in 1924. By the 1930s, the UK regulated ventilation and made asbestosis an excusable work-related disease, followed by the U.S about ten years later.<ref name="qsqlui" /> The term mesothelioma was first used in medical literature in 1931; its association with asbestos was first noted sometime in the 1940s.

Approximately 100,000 people in the United States have died, or will die, from asbestos exposure related to ship building. In the [[Hampton Roads]] area, a shipbuilding center, mesothelioma occurrence is seven times the national rate.<ref>Burke, Bill (6 May 2001) [http://web.archive.org/web/20071012143526/http://hamptonroads.com/pilotonline/special/asbestos/intro.html "Shipbuilding's Deadly Legacy: Introduction: Horrible Toll Could Have Been Avoided"] ''Virginian-Pilot'' Norfolk, Virginia (newspaper); from [[Internet Archive]]</ref> Thousands of tons of asbestos were used in World War II ships to wrap the pipes, line the boilers, and cover engine and turbine parts. There were approximately 4.3 million shipyard workers in the United States during WWII; for every thousand workers about fourteen died of mesothelioma and an unknown number died from asbestosis.<ref name=hamptonroads>Burke, Bill (6 May 2001) [http://www.asbestos-attorney.com/pilot3-1.htm "Shipyards, a Crucible for Tragedy: Part 1: How the war created a monster"] ''Virginian-Pilot'' Norfolk, Virginia (newspaper)</ref>

The United States government and asbestos industry have been criticized for not acting quickly enough to inform the public of dangers, and to reduce public exposure. In the late 1970s court documents proved that asbestos industry officials knew of asbestos dangers since the 1930s and had concealed them from the public.<ref name=hamptonroads/>

In Australia, asbestos was widely used in construction and other industries between 1945 and 1980. From the 1970s there was increasing concern about the dangers of asbestos, and its use was phased out. Mining ceased in 1983. The use of asbestos was phased out in 1989 and banned entirely in December 2003. The dangers of asbestos are now well known in Australia and there is help and support for sufferers from asbestosis or mesothelioma.<ref>Peter Lavelle [http://www.abc.net.au/health/library/stories/2004/04/29/1828906.htm Australian Broadcasting Corporation Fact File: Asbestos], 29 April 2004</ref>

==Specific products==

Serpentine minerals have a sheet or layered structure. Chrysotile is the only asbestos mineral in the serpentine group. In the United States, chrysotile has been the most commonly used type of asbestos. According to the U.S. EPA Asbestos Building Inspectors Manual, chrysotile accounts for approximately 95% of asbestos found in buildings in the United States.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Chrysotile is often present in a wide variety of products and materials, including:

===Amphibole group===

Amphiboles including [[amosite]] (brown asbestos) and [[crocidolite]] (blue asbestos) were formerly used in many products until the early 1980s. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Tremolite]] asbestos constituted a contaminant of many if not all naturally occurring chrysotile deposits.  The use of all types of asbestos in the amphibole group was banned in much of the Western world by the mid-1980s, and in Japan by 1995. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Some products that included amphibole types of asbestos included the following:

While mostly chrysotile asbestos fibers were once used in automobile [[brake pads]], shoes, and [[clutch|clutch discs]], contaminants of amphiboles were present. Since approximately the mid-1990s, brake pads, new or replacement, have been manufactured instead with linings made of ceramic, carbon, metallic and [[Aramid|aramid fiber]] ([[Twaron]] or [[Kevlar]]—the same material used in [[bulletproof vest]]s).

Disease is very unlikely to result from a single, high-level exposure, or from a short period of exposure to lower levels.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

===Possible Mechanisms of Carcinogenicity===
Stanton and Layard hypothesized in 1977–78 that toxicity of fibrous materials is ''not'' initiated by ''chemical'' effects;<ref>Stanton,M.F., and Layard,M. (1978). ''The carcinogenicity of fibrous minerals''. National Bureau of Standards Special Publication 506 – from Gaitherburg conference of July 1977.</ref> that is, any trigger-effects of asbestos must presumably be ''physical'', such as (A) ''mechanical'' damage or (B) unwanted ''signal channels'' (a plausible property for slender transparent fibres) which might disrupt normal cell activity—especially [[mitosis]].

(A) Mechanical Damage. There is experimental evidence that very slim fibers (<60&nbsp;nm, <0.06 μm
in breadth) do tangle destructively with chromosomes (being of comparable size).<ref>{{cite journal|author = Voytek P., Anver T.Thorslund|year = 1990|title = Mechanisms of Asbestos Carcinogenicity|journal = J.

Med. Sci.|volume = 71|issue = 1–2| pages = 1–10|pmid = 19358470}}</ref> This is likely to cause the sort of mitosis disruption expected in cancer.

(B) Unwanted Signal channels. This has recently been explored theoretically, but not yet experimentally. The theory argues that this effect would only be feasible for asbestos fibers >100&nbsp;nm in breadth (>150&nbsp;nm in the case of chrysotile), which suggests that we should be on the look-out for a possible mixture of different mechanisms for the different fiber-diameter-ranges.<ref name=r1>Traill, R.R.

One popular idea of the causal chain is (1) Asbestos fiber → → (3) [[inflammation]] → (4) other pathology. While that may be true, it does not explain "'''(2)''', the actual trigger":
:"What is the ''physical'' property of asbestos which ''initiates'' any such inflammation?" (After all, inflammation is usually seen as caused by ''chemical''-based processes: immunological &/or bacterial). So inflammation (&/or oxidation etc.) may well be part of the causal chain, ''but not the crucial first step''.<ref name=r1/>

===Other asbestos-related diseases===
{{main|Asbestos-related diseases}}
*It is important to consult a doctor, particularly if the following symptoms develop: shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness, persistent cough that worsens over time, blood in fluid coughed up, pain or tightening in chest, difficulty swallowing, swelling of neck or face, decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue or [[anemia]].<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/asbestos Asbestos Exposure and Cancer Risk – National Cancer Institute]. Cancer.gov. Retrieved on 2012-01-10.</ref>

*'''Asbestosis''': Progressive fibrosis of the lungs of varying severity, progressing to bilateral fibrosis, honeycombing of the lungs on radiological view with symptoms including rales and wheezing. Individuals who have been exposed to asbestos via home, environment, work should notify their doctors about exposure history.
*'''Asbestos warts''': caused when the sharp fibers lodge in the skin and are overgrown causing benign [[callus]]-like growths.
*'''Pleural plaques''': discrete fibrous or partially calcified thickened area which can be seen on [[X-ray]]s of individuals exposed to asbestos. Although pleural plaques are themselves asymptomatic, in some patients this develops into pleural thickening.
*'''Diffuse pleural thickening''': similar to above and can sometimes be associated with asbestosis. Usually no symptoms shown but if exposure is extensive, it can cause [[lung]] impairment.
*'''[[Pneumothorax]]''': Some reports have also linked the condition of pneumothorax to asbestos related diseases.

===Chemistry===
[[File:Anthophyllite asbestos SEM.jpg|thumb|right|Asbestos fibers ([[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] micrograph)]]
Asbestos fibers are invisible to the unaided [[human eye]] because their size is about 3–20&nbsp;µm wide and can be as slim as 0.01&nbsp;µm. [[Human hair]] ranges in size from 17 to 181&nbsp;µm in breadth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/BrianLey.shtml| work=The Physics Factbook|title= Diameter of a Human Hair|last=Ley|first=Brian|year=1999}}</ref> Fibers ultimately form because when these minerals originally cooled and crystallized, they formed by the polymeric molecules lining up parallel with each other and forming oriented [[crystal structure|crystal lattices]]. These crystals thus have three [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage planes]], and in this case, there are two cleavage planes which are much weaker than the third. When sufficient force is applied, they tend to break along their weakest directions, resulting in a linear fragmentation pattern and hence a fibrous form. This fracture process can keep occurring and one larger asbestos fiber can ultimately become the source of hundreds of much thinner and smaller fibers.

When fibers or asbestos structures from asbestos containing materials(ACM) become airborne, the process is called primary release. Primary release mechanisms include [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]], [[wikt:Special:Search/impaction|impaction]], fallout, air [[erosion]], vibration, and fire damage. Secondary release occurs when settled asbestos fibers and structures are resuspended as a result of human activities. In unoccupied buildings or during unoccupied periods, fiber release typically occurs by fallout or is induced by vibration or air erosion.<ref name="godish40">{{cite book|last=Godish|first=Thad|title=Indoor Environmental Quality|year=2001|publisher=CRC Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56670-402-2|page=40}}</ref>

Friability of a product containing asbestos means that it is so soft and weak in structure that it can be broken with simple finger crushing pressure. Friable materials are of the most initial concern because of their ease of damage. The forces or conditions of usage that come into intimate contact with most non-friable materials containing asbestos are substantially higher than finger pressure.

===Identification and Assessment===
A fiber cannot be identified or ruled out as asbestos, either using the naked eye or by simply looking at a fiber under a regular microscope.  The most common methods of identifying asbestos fibers are by using [[polarized light microscopy|polarized light microscopy (PLM)]] or [[transmission electron microscopy|transmission electron microscopy (TEM)]].  PLM is less expensive, but TEM is more precise and can be used at lower concentrations of asbestos. 

If asbestos abatement is performed, completion of the abatement is verified using visual confirmation and may also involve air sampling.  Air samples are typically analyzed using [[phase contrast microscopy|phase contrast microscopy (PCM)]].  PCM involves counting fibers on a filter using a microscope.  Airborne occupational exposure limits for asbestos are based on using the PCM method. 

The [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] has a recommended Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for asbestos of 0.1 fibers/mL over an 8 hour shift.  OSHA in the United States and occupational health and safety regulatory jurisdictions in Canada use 0.1 fibers/mL over an 8 hour shift as their exposure limits.<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/asbestos/asbestos_exposure_health/detecting.html ATSDR – Asbestos – Detecting asbestos-related health problems].

===Common Building Materials Containing Asbestos===
Most products manufactured today do not contain asbestos.  In the industrialized world, asbestos was phased out of building products mostly in the 1970s with most of the remainder phased out by the 1980s.  Asbestos containing building materials in residences includes a variety of products, such as: stiple used in textured walls and ceilings; [[drywall joint filler compound]]; asbestos contaminated [[Vermiculite#Asbestos_contamination|vermiculite]], [[vinyl floor tile]]; vinyl sheet flooring; window [[putty]]; mastic; [[cement board]]; furnace tape; and [[stucco]]. Other sources of asbestos containing materials include [[fireproofing]] and [[Architectural acoustics|acoustic materials]].<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/help.html#health Basic Information | Asbestos | [[US EPA]]] (28 June 2006). Retrieved on 2012-01-10.</ref>

===Exposure===
Asbestos exposure becomes an issue if asbestos containing materials become airborne, such as due to deterioration or damage.  Building occupants may be exposed to asbestos, but those most at risk are persons who purposely disturb materials, such as maintenance/construction workers.   Housekeeping/custodial employees may be at increased risk as they may potentially clean up damaged or deteriorated asbestos containing materials without knowing that the material contains asbestos.  Asbestos abatement/remediation workers and emergency personnel such as firefighters may also become exposed.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/asbestos_in_schools.html Asbestos in Schools | Asbestos | US EPA].

Asbestos from natural geologic deposits is known as "naturally occurring asbestos" (NOA). Health risks associated with exposure to NOA are not yet fully understood, and current US federal regulations do not address exposure from NOA. Many populated areas are in proximity to shallow, natural deposits which occur in 50 of 58 California counties and in 19 other U.S. states. In one study, data was collected from 3,000 mesothelioma patients in California and 890 men with [[prostate cancer]], a malignancy not known to be related to asbestos. The study found a correlation between the incidence of mesotheliomas and the distance a patient lived from known deposits of rock likely to include asbestos; the correlation was not present when the incidence of prostate cancer was compared with the same distances. According to the study, risk of mesothelioma declined by 6% for every 10&nbsp;km that an individual had lived away from a likely asbestos source.<ref name=Raloff>{{cite journal|last=Raloff|first=Janet|title=Dirty Little Secret|doi=10.2307/4017077|pages=26–28|volume=170|issue=2|journal=Science News|year=2006}}</ref>

Portions of [[El Dorado County, California]] are known to contain natural amphibole asbestos formations at the surface.<ref name=Raloff/><ref>"[http://motherjones.com/environment/2007/05/not-their-back-yard Not in Their Back Yard]", ''Mother Jones'', May/June 2007.</ref> The [[USGS]] studied amphiboles in rock and soil in the area in response to an EPA sampling study and subsequent criticism of the EPA study. The EPA study was refuted by its own peer reviewers and never completed or published. The study found that many amphibole particles in the area meet the counting rule criteria used by the EPA for chemical and morphological limits, but do not meet morphological requirements for commercial-grade-asbestos. The executive summary pointed out that even particles that do not meet requirements for commercial-grade-asbestos may be a health threat and suggested a collaborative research effort to assess health risks associated with "Naturally Occurring Asbestos."

However, the main criticism pointed at EPA was that their testing was conducted in small isolated areas of El Dorado where there were no amphibole asbestos deposits, thus the language regarding amphibole, nonfibrous "particles". Actual surface amphibole deposits in residential areas were ignored for testing purposes. Thus no final findings were published by ATSDR since the criticism was correct and the effort of combined EPA/ATSDR teams were wasted time and money.<ref>{{cite document|last=Meeker|first=G.P.|last2=Lowers|first2=H.A.|last3=Swayze|first3=G.A.|last4=Van Gosen|first4=B.S.|title=Mineralogy and Morphology of Amphiboles Observed in Soils and Rocks in El Dorado Hills, California|date=December, 2006|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2006/1362/|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|last5=Stutley|first5=S.J.|last6=Brownfield|first6=I.K.}}</ref>

Great deals of [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] were also found to be underlain with tremolite. The county monitored air quality at construction sites, controlled soil taken from affected areas, and required freshly developed sites to lay {{convert|6|in|mm}} of clean, stable material over the ground.<ref name=Raloff/>

Globally, collected samples from Antarctic ice indicate chrysotile asbestos has been a ubiquitous contaminant of the environment for at least 10,000 years. Snow samples in Japan have shown ambient background levels are one to two orders of magnitude higher in urban than in rural areas. Higher concentrations of airborne asbestos fibers are reported in urban areas where there is more ACM (asbestos containing materials) and mechanisms of release (vehicles braking and weathering of asbestos cement materials); concentrations in the range of 1–20&nbsp;ng/m^3 have been reported. Fibers longer than 5μm are rarely found in rural areas. Ambient concentrations using [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] analysis have been based on mass measurements.<ref name="godish40"/>

==History of health concerns and regulation==

''For additional chronological citations, see also, [[List of asbestos disease medical articles]]''

===Until 1900===
By the first century AD, Greeks and Romans are claimed to have observed that slaves involved in the weaving of asbestos cloth were afflicted with a sickness of the lungs,<ref>P. Brodeur, [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1985/06/10/1985_06_10_049_TNY_CARDS_000342653 "Annals of Law, The Asbestos Industry on Trial, 1-A Failure to Warn"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 10 June 1985, p. 57</ref> although this is not confirmed by examination of primary sources.<ref name=Maines2005/>

Early concern in the modern era on the health effects of asbestos exposure can be found in several sources. Among the earliest were reports in Britain. The annual reports of the Chief Inspector of Factories reported as early as 1898 that asbestos had "easily demonstrated" health risks.<ref>Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops, "Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops for the Year 1898", 1899, cited in Tweedale referenced below</ref>

At about the same time, what was probably the first study of mortality among asbestos workers was reported in France.<ref>D. Auribault, "Note sur l'Hygiène et la Sécurité des Ouvriers dans les Filatures et Tissages d'Amianté (On hygiene and security of the workers in the spinning and weaving of asbestos)" in Le Bulletin de l'Inspection du Travail, 1906, pp 120–132. This summary was given by Brodeur and roughly confirmed by Merewether & Price in the report cited below.</ref> While the study describes the cause of death as [[chalicosis]], a generalized pneumoconiosis, the circumstances of the employment of the fifty workers whose death prompted the study suggest that the root cause was asbestos or mixed asbestos-cotton dust exposure.

===1900s–1910s===
[[File:Ferruginous body.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] demonstrating [[asbestosis]] of the lung ([[ferruginous bodies]]). [[H&E stain]].]]
Further awareness of asbestos-related diseases can be found in the early 1900s, when London doctor H. Montague Murray conducted a post mortem exam on a young asbestos factory worker who died in 1899. Dr. Murray gave testimony on this death in connection with an industrial disease compensation hearing. The post-mortem confirmed the presence of asbestos in the lung tissue, prompting Dr. Murray to express as an expert opinion his belief that the inhalation of asbestos dust had at least contributed to, if not actually caused, the death of the worker.<ref>H. M. Murray, testimony before the Departmental Committee on Compensation for Industrial Diseases "Minutes of Evidence, Appendices and Index", 1907. p. 127 cited and summarized in Merewether & Price referenced below.</ref>

The record in the United States was similar. Early observations were largely anecdotal in nature and did not definitively link the occupation with the disease, followed by more compelling and larger studies that strengthened the association. One such study, published in 1918, noted:

:All of these processes unquestionably involve a considerable dust hazard, but the hygienic aspects of the industry have not been reported upon. It may be said, in conclusion, that in the practice of American and Canadian [[life insurance]] companies, asbestos workers are generally declined on account of the assumed health-injurious conditions of the industry.<ref>{{cite journal|author=F. L.

===1920s–1930s===
Widespread recognition of the occupational risks of asbestos in Britain was reported in 1924 by a Dr. Cooke, a pathologist, who introduced a case description of a 33-year-old female asbestos worker, [[Nellie Kershaw]], with the following: "Medical men in areas where asbestos is manufactured have long suspected the dust to be the cause of chronic bronchitis and fibrosis&nbsp;..."<ref>{{cite journal|author=W. E. Cooke|title=Fibrosis of the Lungs Due to the Inhalation of Asbestos Dust|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=2|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.3317.147|year=1924|pmc=2304688|pmid=20771679|issue=3317|pages=147–140.2}}</ref> Dr. Cooke then went on to report on a case in 1927 involving a 33-year-old male worker who was the only survivor out of ten workers in an asbestos [[carding]] room. In the report he named the disease "asbestosis".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cooke|first1=W.

Dr. Cooke's second case report was followed, in the late 1920s, by a large public health investigation (now known as the Merewether report after one of its two authors) that examined some 360 asbestos-textile workers (reported to be about 15% of the total comparable employment in Britain at the time) and found that about a quarter of them suffered from pulmonary fibrosis.<ref>E.R.A.

Stationery Office, 1930</ref> This investigation resulted in improved regulation of the manufacturing of asbestos-containing products in the early 1930s. Regulations included industrial hygiene standards, medical examinations, and inclusion of the asbestos industry into the British Workers' Compensation Act.<ref>Geoffrey Tweedale, ''Magic Mineral to Killer Dust, Turner & Newall and the Asbestos Hazard'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 21.

The first known U.S. workers' compensation claim for asbestos disease was in 1927.<ref>Broduer, pp. 59–60.</ref> In 1930, the first reported autopsy of an asbestosis sufferer was conducted in the United States and later presented by a doctor at the [[Mayo Clinic]], although in this case the exposure involved mining activities somewhere in South America.<ref>R.

In 1930, the major asbestos company Johns-Manville produced a report, for internal company use only, about medical reports of asbestos worker fatalities.<ref name="Castleman"/> In 1932, a letter from U.S. Bureau of Mines to asbestos manufacturer [[Eagle-Picher]] stated, in relevant part, "It is now known that asbestos dust is one of the most dangerous dusts to which man is exposed."<ref name=Brodeur>{{cite book|author=Paul Brodeur|title=Outrageous Misconduct: The Asbestos Industry on Trial|edition=1st|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1985|isbn=0-394-53320-8}}</ref>

In 1933, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. doctors found that 29% of workers in a Johns-Manville plant had asbestosis.<ref name="Castleman"/> Likewise, in 1933, Johns-Manville officials settled lawsuits by 11 employees with asbestosis on the condition that the employees' lawyer agree to never again "directly or indirectly participate in the bringing of new actions against the Corporation."<ref name=Brodeur/> In 1934, officials of two large asbestos companies, Johns-Manville and Raybestos-Manhattan, edited an article about the diseases of asbestos workers written by a Metropolitan Life Insurance Company doctor. The changes downplayed the danger of asbestos dust.<ref name=Brodeur/> In 1935, officials of Johns-Manville and Raybestos-Manhattan instructed the editor of ''Asbestos'' magazine to publish nothing about asbestosis.<ref name=Brodeur/> In 1936, a group of asbestos companies agreed to sponsor research on the health effects of asbestos dust, but required that the companies maintain complete control over the disclosure of the results.<ref name="Castleman"/>

===1940s===
In 1942, an internal Owens-Corning corporate memo referred to "medical literature on asbestosis&nbsp;... scores of publications in which the lung and skin hazards of asbestos are discussed."<ref name="Castleman">Castleman, p. 195.</ref> Testimony given in a federal court in 1984 by Charles H. Roemer, formerly an employee of Unarco, described a meeting in the early 1940s between Unarco officials, J-M President [[Lewis H. Brown]] and J-M attorney Vandiver Brown. Roemer stated, "I'll never forget, I turned to Mr. Brown, one of the Browns made this crack (that Unarco managers were a bunch of fools for notifying employees who had asbestosis), and I said, 'Mr. Brown, do you mean to tell me you would let them work until they dropped dead?'

===1950s===
In 1951, asbestos companies removed all references to cancer before allowing publication of research they sponsored.<ref>Castleman, p. 71.</ref> In 1952, Dr. Kenneth Smith, Johns-Manville medical director, recommended (unsuccessfully) that warning labels be attached to products containing asbestos. Later, Smith testified: "It was a business decision as far as I could understand&nbsp;... the corporation is in business to provide jobs for people and make money for stockholders and they had to take into consideration the effects of everything they did and if the application of a caution label identifying a product as hazardous would cut into sales, there would be serious financial implications."<ref>Castleman, p. 666</ref>

In 1953, National Gypsum's safety director wrote to the Indiana Division of Industrial Hygiene, recommending that [[acoustic plaster]] mixers wear respirators "because of the asbestos used in the product." Another company official noted that the letter was "full of dynamite" and urged that it be retrieved before reaching its destination. A memo in the files noted that the company "succeeded in stopping" the letter, which "will be modified."<ref>Castleman, pp. 669–70.</ref>

===1960s–1980s===
Through the 1970s, asbestos was used to fireproof roofing and flooring, for heat insulation, and for a variety of other purposes. The material was used in fire-check partitioning and doors on North Sea Oil Production Platforms and Rigs.

During mid-to late 1980s, public health concern focused on potential asbestos fiber exposures of building occupants and workers in buildings containing asbestos containing building materials (ACBM) and their risks of developing lung cancer or mesothelioma. As a consequence, the Health Effects Institute (Cambridge, MA) convened a panel to evaluate the lifetime cancer risk of general building occupants as well as service workers.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100322222814/http://www.asbestos-institute.ca/reviews/hei-ar/hei-ar.html Asbestos in Public and Commercial Buildings: A Literature Review and Synthesis of Current Knowledge (1991)]. asbestos-institute.ca</ref>

===Modern regulation===
{{Main|Asbestos and the law}}

====United States====
{{abbreviations|section|date=February 2013}}
In 1981, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requested information from American companies regarding the asbestos content of their products.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2607 Asbestos Information Act language]</ref>

In 1989 the EPA issued the Asbestos Ban and Phase Out Rule which was subsequently overturned in the case of ''Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA'', 947 F.2d 1201 (5th Cir. 1991). This ruling leaves many consumer products that can still legally contain trace amounts of asbestos. For a clarification of products which legally contain asbestos, read the EPA's clarification statement.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/asbbans2.pdf EPA clarification statement on asbestos] (PDF)</ref> 

In 2010, Washington State banned asbestos in automotive brakes starting in 2014.<ref>[http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/hwtr/betterbrakes.html Washington State Better Brakes Law]</ref>

The EPA has proposed a concentration limit of seven million fibers per liter of drinking water for long fibers (lengths greater than or equal to 5&nbsp;µm). The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), has set limits of 100,000 fibers with lengths greater than or equal to 5&nbsp;µm per cubic meter of workplace air for eight-hour shifts and 40-hour work weeks.<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts61.html ToxFAQs for Asbestos], [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]].</ref>

OSHA regulations regarding asbestos are covered in 29 C.F.R. 1926.1101. Such work is divided into four categories.

Class I asbestos work means activities involving the removal of TSI and surfacing ACM and PACM.

Class II asbestos work means activities involving the removal of ACM which is not thermal system insulation or surfacing material. This includes, but is not limited to, the removal of asbestos-containing wallboard, floor tile and sheeting, roofing and siding shingles, and construction mastics.

Class III asbestos work means repair and maintenance operations, where "ACM", including TSI and surfacing ACM and PACM, is likely to be disturbed.

Class IV asbestos work means maintenance and custodial activities during which employees contact but do not disturb ACM or PACM and activities to clean up dust, waste and debris resulting from Class I, II, and III activities.<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=10862&p_table=STANDARDS Asbestos – 1926.1101].

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, blue and brown asbestos materials were banned outright in 1985 while the import, sale and second hand reuse of white asbestos was outlawed in 1999.  The 2012 Control of Asbestos Regulations state that owners of non-domestic buildings (e.g., factories and offices) have a "duty to manage" asbestos on the premises by making themselves aware of its presence and ensuring the material does not deteriorate, removing it if necessary.  Employers, e.g. construction companies, whose operatives may come into contact with asbestos must also provide annual asbestos training to their workers<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/regulations.htm |title=Control of Asbetstos Regulations 2012 |publisher=Heath and Safety Executive (HSE) |accessdate=2012}}</ref>

====Australia====
The use of crocidolite (blue) asbestos was banned in 1967, while the use of amosite (brown) asbestos continued in the construction industry until the mid-1980s.

==Contamination of other products==

===Asbestos and vermiculite===
[[Vermiculite]] is a hydrated laminar magnesium-aluminum-iron silicate which resembles [[mica]]. It can be used for many industrial applications and has been used as insulation. Some deposits of vermiculite have been found to be contaminated with small amounts of asbestos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/verm.html |title=EPA Asbestos Contamination In Vermiculite |publisher=Epa.gov|date=28 June 2006|accessdate=2010-01-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100111080049/http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/verm.html| archivedate= 11 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> 

One vermiculite mine operated by [[W. R. Grace and Company]] in [[Libby, Montana]] exposed workers and community residents to danger by mining vermiculite contaminated with asbestos, typically [[actinolite]] or [[tremolite]]. Vermiculite contaminated with asbestos from the Libby mine was used as insulation in residential and commercial buildings through Canada and the United States.  [[W. R. Grace and Company]]'s vermiculite was marketed as [[Zonolite]].  

In 1999 the EPA began cleanup efforts in Libby and now the area is a [[Superfund]] cleanup area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/libby/|title=Libby Asbestos – US EPA Region 8|publisher=Epa.gov |accessdate=2010-01-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100205101037/http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/libby/| archivedate= 5 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The EPA has determined that harmful asbestos is released from the mine as well as through other activities that disturb soil in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/libby/risk.html|title=Risk Assessment – US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov|date=22 December 2008|accessdate=2010-01-12}}</ref>

==Asbestos in construction==

===Asbestos construction in developed countries===
[[File:Asbestos ceiling.jpg|thumb|right|Older decorative ceilings, like this one, often contain small amounts of [[white asbestos]].]]
[[File:Durabestos advertisement.jpg|thumb|right|1929 newspaper advertisement from Perth, Western Australia, for [[asbestos sheeting]] for residential building construction.]]
The use of asbestos in new construction projects has been banned for health and safety reasons in many developed countries or regions, including the European Union, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and New Zealand. A notable exception is the United States, where asbestos continues to be used in construction such as cement asbestos pipes. The 5th Circuit Court prevented the EPA from banning asbestos in 1991 because although EPA research showed it would cost between $450 and 800 million and save around 200 lives in a 13-year length, the EPA did not provide adequate evidence for the safety of alternative products.<ref>[http://openjurist.org/947/f2d/1201/corrosion-proof-fittings-v-environmental-protection-agency 947 F. 2d 1201 – Corrosion Proof Fittings v.

Retrieved on 2012-01-10.</ref> Until the mid-1980s, small amounts of white asbestos were used in the manufacture of [[Artex]], a decorative stipple finish,<ref>[http://www.asbestossurveyingltd.co.uk/where_asbestos_ceiling_artex.htm ''Where can asbestos be found'', Asbestos Surveying Ltd, Birmingham, UK, 2 08 2008].Accessed: 12-29-2008.</ref> however, some of the lesser-known suppliers of Artex were still adding white asbestos until 1999.<ref>[http://www.artex.co.uk/ Artex website], Click the "Asbestos in Artex" button.</ref> Removing or disturbing Artex is not recommended, as it may contain white asbestos.

Prior to the ban, asbestos was widely used in the construction industry in thousands of materials, some are judged to be more dangerous than others due to the amount of asbestos and a materials friable nature. Sprayed coatings, pipe insulation and Asbestos Insulating Board (AIB) are thought to be the most dangerous due to their high content of asbestos and friable nature. Many older buildings built before the late 1990s contain asbestos. In the United States, there is a minimum standard for asbestos surveys as described by [[ASTM]] Standard E 2356–04. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency includes some but not all asbestos-contaminated facilities on the Superfund National Priorities list (NPL). Renovation and demolition of asbestos contaminated buildings is subject to EPA [[NESHAP]] and OSHA Regulations. Asbestos is not a material covered under [[CERCLA]]'s innocent purchaser defense. In the UK, the removal and disposal of asbestos and of substances containing it are covered by the [[Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006]].<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/regulations.htm ''Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006'', Health and Safety Exceutive, London, UK, Undated].Accessed: 12-29-2008.</ref>

In older buildings (e.g. those built prior to 1999 in the UK, before white asbestos was finally banned), asbestos may still be present in some areas e.g. old bath panels, concrete [[water tanks]] and many other places.<!-- THERE ARE TOO MANY POSSIBLE LOCATIONS FOR ASBESTOS IN BUILDINGS, SO PLEASE DO NOT LIST THEM HERE. --> Being aware of asbestos locations reduces the risk of disturbing asbestos.<ref name="Wrekin housing trust pdf">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrekinhousingtrust.org.uk/publications/leaflets/Asbestos%20in%20the%20Home%20Booklet%2006-20061.pdf|title=Asbestos in the home booklet.

===Asbestos construction in developing countries===
Some countries, such as [[India]], Indonesia, China, Russia and Brazil have continued widespread use of asbestos. The most common is corrugated asbestos-cement sheets or "A/C Sheets" for roofing and for side walls. Millions of homes, factories, schools or sheds and shelters continue to use asbestos. Cutting these sheets to size and drilling holes to receive 'J' bolts to help secure the sheets to roof framing is done on-site.

In 1999 there were 200,000 related cases pending in the federal court system of the United States.<ref>United States. Cong. Hearing: Asbestos Litigation. 107th Cong., 2nd sess. HRG.107-993. Washington: GPO, 2002.</ref> Further, it is estimated that within the next 40 years, the number of cases may increase to 700,000. These numbers help explain how there are thousands of current pending cases.

Litigation of asbestos materials has been slow. Companies sometimes counter saying that health issues do not currently appear in their worker or workers, or sometimes are settled out of court.<ref>Carroll, Stephen J., Deborah Hensler, Allan Abrahamse, Jennifer Gross, Michelle White, Scott Ashwood, and Elizabeth Sloss. Asbestos Litigation Costs and Compensation. Santa Monica,CA: RAND, 2002.</ref> The Research and Development (RAND) think tank has appropriated certain legal information which is readily available for proclaimed victims of natural resource accidents. This information has helped many workers, regardless of health condition, earn compensation through companies. RAND, along with the Institute for Civil Justice (ICJ) have been proponents of the organization of past cases in order to determine one aspect of fair compensation for workers.

In 1999 the United States enacted the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act.<ref name = "lxkrvq">United States. Cong. Senate. Finding Solutions to the Asbestos Litigation Problem: the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1999. 106nd Cong., 1st sess. S.758. Washington: GPO, 1999.</ref> Between 1981 and the present, many asbestos companies have filed for bankruptcy.<ref>[http://www.crowell.com/pdf/AsbestosChart1.pdf Chart of Bankrupt Asbestos manufacturers and distributors]</ref>  While companies filed for bankruptcy, this limited payouts to those who were actually affected by the material. Professor Christopher Edley said what the 1999 Act ultimately would have done if passed would be to "limit punitive damages that seek retribution for the decisions of long-dead executives for conduct that took place decades ago (Professor [[Christopher Edley, Jr.]])."<ref name = "lxkrvq"/>

In Australia a significant and controversial case was brought against the industrial building materials company [[James Hardie]], which had mined and sold asbestos related products for many years. 

Litigation exists outside the United States in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]] among other nations (though the amounts awarded in these countries are not as large as in the US). See the [[Asbestos and the law|companion article]] for further information.

The volume of the asbestos liability has concerned manufacturers and [[insurance industry|insurers and reinsurers]].<ref>American Academy of Acturaries' Mass Torts Subcomittee, "Overview of Asbestos Claims Issues and Trends, August 2007 pp 7–8</ref> The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.

==Other criticism==
Asbestos regulation critics include the asbestos industry<ref>[http://multinationalmonitor.org/mm1998/mm9801.09.html Multinational Monitor article on Corporate junk science]. Retrieved 16 December 2006</ref> and JunkScience.com owner [[Steven Milloy]]. Critics argue that the outright banning of dangerous products, due to  [[government regulation]], is inferior to keeping the products while innovating ways to prevent the lethal effects. They argue that the product benefits are too important to ignore, and instead of banning the products, find ways to eliminate risks to those who work with the products. An example is the suggestion by [[Dixy Lee Ray]] and others that the [[shuttle Challenger]] disintegrated because the maker of [[O-ring]] putty was pressured by the EPA into ceasing production of asbestos-laden putty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehr|first=Jay H., editor|title=Rational Readings on Environmental Concerns |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |year=1992 |page=119 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LsXmMHOT8VsC&pg=PA119 |isbn=0-442-01146-6}}</ref><ref name=Challenger>{{cite web|url=http://info-pollution.com/challenger.htm |title=Asbestos and Challenger Disaster |publisher=Info-pollution.com|date=9 February 1986|accessdate=2010-01-12}}</ref> However, the putty used in ''Challenger''{{'}}s final flight ''did'' contain asbestos, and failures in the putty were not responsible for the failure of the O-ring that led to loss of the shuttle.<ref name=Challenger/><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11031097/page/2/ MSNBC article on myths of the Challenger disaster].

Asbestos was used in the first forty floors of the World Trade Center north tower causing an airborne contamination among lower Manhattan after the towers collapsed in [[September 11, 2001 attacks|the attacks on 11 September 2001]].  Steven Milloy of the Cato Institute suggested that the World Trade Center towers could still be standing or at least would have stood longer had a 1971 ban not stopped the completion of the asbestos coating above the 64th floor.<ref>[http://prwatch.org/prwissues/2001Q4/junkman.html The Junkman's Answer to Terrorism: Use More Asbestos].

==Substitutes for asbestos in construction==
[[Glass wool|Fiberglass]] insulation was invented in 1938 and is now the most commonly used type of [[building insulation materials|insulation material]]. The safety of this material is also being called into question due to similarities in material structure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rachel.org/?q=en/node/3999|title=Fiber Glass: A Carcinogen That's Everywhere|date=31 May 1995|work=Rachel's News|publisher=Environmental Research Foundation}}</ref>  However, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] removed fiberglass from its list of possible human carcinogens in 2001.<ref>http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/ClassificationsGroupOrder.pdf</ref>

In 1978, a highly texturized fiberglass fabric was invented by [[Bal Dixit]], called [[Zetex (fabric)|Zetex]]. This fabric is lighter than asbestos, but offers the same bulk, thickness, hand, feel, and abrasion resistance as asbestos. The fiberglass was texturized to eliminate some of the problems that arise with fiberglass, such as poor abrasion resistance and poor seam strength<ref>Dixit, B., [http://books.google.com/books?id=JkaAypWOi0AC&pg=PA446 "Performance of Protective Clothing: Development and Testing of Asbestos Substitutes,"] Performance of Protective Clothing, ASTM STP 900, R. L. Barker and G. C. Coletta, Eds., American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, 1986, pp. 446–460 ISBN 0-8031-0461-8.</ref>

In Europe [[mineral wool]] and [[glass wool]] are the main insulators in houses.

Many companies that produced asbestos-cement products that were reinforced with asbestos fibers have developed products incorporating organic fibers. One such product was known as "[[Eternit]]" and another "Everite" now use "[[Nutec]]" fibers which consist of organic fibers, [[portland cement]] and [[silica]]. [[Cement-bonded wood fiber]] is another substitute. Stone fibers are used in gaskets and friction materials.

Another potential fiber is [[polybenzimidazole]] or PBI fiber. [[Polybenzimidazole fiber]] is a [[synthetic fiber]] with high [[melting point]] of 760&nbsp;°C that also does not ignite. Because of its exceptional thermal and chemical stability, it is often used by [[fire station|fire departments]] and [[List of space agencies|space agencies]].

[[File:AsbestosContainment.JPG|right|thumb|175px|Old [[Wailuku]] Post Office sealed off for [[asbestos removal]]]]
Asbestos alternatives for industrial use include sleeves, rope, tape, fabric, textiles and [[insulation batt materials]] made from [[fiberglass]] and silica.

==Recycling and disposal==
In most developed countries, asbestos is typically disposed of as [[hazardous waste]] in [[landfill site]]s.
[[Image:Red Road flats.jpg|left|thumb|Condemned buildings using asbestos in their structure, such as the [[Red Road (flats)|Red Road]] towers in [[Scotland]], pose huge challenges for demolition contractors]]

The [[demolition]] of buildings containing large amounts of asbestos based materials pose particular problems for builders and property developers - such buildings often have to be deconstructed piece by piece, or the asbestos has to be painstakingly removed before the structure can be razed by mechanical or explosive means.  One such example is the Red Road high-rise housing development in [[Glasgow]], Scotland which used huge amounts of asbestos cement board for wall panelling - here British health and safety regulations stipulate that asbestos material has to be removed to a landfill site via an approved route at certain times of the day in specially adapted vehicles.

Asbestos can be recycled by transforming it into harmless [[silicate glass]]. A process of thermal decomposition at 1000–1250&nbsp;°C produces a mixture of non-hazardous silicate phases, and at temperatures above 1250&nbsp;°C it produces silicate glass.<ref name="gualtieri">{{cite journal|author=A F Gualtieri and A Tartaglia|title=Thermal decomposition of asbestos and recycling in traditional ceramics|journal=Journal of the European Ceramic Society |volume=20 |issue=9 |month=August |year=2000 |pages=1409–1418|doi=10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00290-3}}</ref> Microwave thermal treatment can be used in an industrial manufacturing process to transform asbestos and asbestos-containing waste into porcelain stoneware tiles, porous single-fired wall tiles, and ceramic bricks.<ref name="leonelli">{{cite journal|author=C Leonelli, P Veronesi, D N Boccaccini, M R Rivasi, L Barbieri, F Andreola, I Lancellotti, D Rabitti, and G C Pellacani|title=Microwave thermal inertisation of asbestos containing waste and its recycling in traditional ceramics|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=135|issue=1–3|date=31 July 2006|pages=149–155|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2005.11.035|pmid=16406335}}</ref>
