'''Catalepsy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''κατάληψις'' "catch") is a nervous condition characterized by [[muscle|muscular]] rigidity and fixity of [[human position|posture]] regardless of external stimuli, as well as decreased sensitivity to [[pain]].<ref>http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11104</ref>

Catalepsy is a symptom of certain nervous disorders or conditions such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[epilepsy]]. It is also a characteristic symptom of [[cocaine]] withdrawal.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms include: rigid body, rigid limbs, limbs staying in same position when moved ([[waxy flexibility]]), no response, loss of muscle control, and slowing down of bodily functions, such as breathing.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0735-7044.102.5.748 |author=Sanberg PR, Bunsey MD, Giordano M, Norman AB |title=The catalepsy test: its ups and downs |journal=Behav.

==Historical Cases==
Anne Carter Lee, the mother of Southern General Robert E. Lee, suffered from cataleptic spells that caused her to fall unconscious and grow rigid with tremors.  As the story goes, she was mistaken for dead during one of these spells and buried in the family plot in Virginia.  Hearing a noise a while later, one of the servants called attention to it, and she was dug up, alive but traumatized.  This supposedly happened in 1806, a year before Robert E. Lee was born.  This is a wonderfully gruesome and touching tale, but it’s probably erroneous.  There is no official record of it, nor is it alluded to in Robert E. Lee’s biographies or those of his father, Henry, who was prominent in his own right.
==Artistic depictions==
In the arts, catalepsy is often used for [[drama]]tic effect, sometimes as a [[plot device]].

===In literature===
In [[Alexandre Dumas, père]]'s novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', the Abbé Faria has fits of catalepsy from time to time, before eventually dying from one.

In [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Silas Marner]]'', the main character Silas Marner frequently has cataleptic fits and seizures. It is not mentioned if they are caused by any of the aforementioned factors.

In [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s "[[The Adventure of the Resident Patient]]", a man feigns catalepsy to gain access to a neurologist's rooms; the doctor attempts to treat him with [[amyl nitrite]].

In [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier]]'', the protagonist Dowell experiences catalepsy following the death of his wife.

In [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', the main character Valentine Michael Smith is believed to have catalepsy when he is returned to Earth.

In [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Premature Burial]]", the narrator develops catalepsy. He fears being mistakenly declared dead and buried alive, and goes to great lengths to prevent this. In another of Poe's short stories, "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]", Madeline Usher has catalepsy, and is buried alive by her unstable brother Roderick. Catalepsy is also depicted in "[[Berenice (short story)|Berenice]]", thus becoming one of the recurrent themes in Poe's fiction.

In [[Poppy Z. Brite]]'s "[[Exquisite Corpse]]", the main character, Comptom, a serial killer (recreation of Jeffery Dahmer's life story) facing a lifetime sentence, uses shamanistic techniques to induce catalepsy, and convincingly deceased is able to escape prison. 

In [[Émile Zola]]'s short story ''[[La Mort d'Olivier Becaille]]'' (''[[The Death of Olivier Becaille]]''), the title character is buried alive and notes that "I must have fallen into one of those cataleptic states that I had read of".

In [[Sax Rohmer]]'s [[Fu-Manchu]] novels, Dr. Fu-Manchu has a serum that induces a state of catalepsy so extreme as to be indistinguishable from death.

In [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel ''[[Bleak House]]'', Mrs. Snagsby has violent spasms before becoming cataleptic and being carried upstairs like a grand piano.

In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy: Greek Philosophy to Plato'', Hegel describes [[Socrates]] as having catalepsy caused by [[magnetic somnambulism]] when in deep meditation.

In [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]]'s novel ''[[Many Dimensions]]'', Sir Giles Tumulty says to Lord Arglay, the Chief Justice of England: "You are a louse-brained catalept, Arglay."

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Now Wait for Last Year]]'', Kathy Sweetscent becomes immobilized by withdrawal from JJ-180, an alien (and highly addictive) drug. "My God, Kathy thought as she stood gazing down at the record by her feet. I can't free myself; I'm going to remain here, and they'll find me like this and know something's terribly wrong. This is catalepsy!"

In the second chapter of [[Álvares de Azevedo]]'s ''[[Noite na Taverna]]'', character Solfieri rescues a woman who has catalepsy from inside a coffin.

===In film and television===

In [[Sam Taylor]]'s ''[[Kiki (1931 film)|Kiki]]'' (1931) [[Mary Pickford]] feigns a case of catalepsy to keep from being removed from the apartment of the man she secretly loves.

In the soap opera [[La Traición]], the main character, Hugo De Medina, has catalepsy. Later in the telenovela it is revealed that his daughter, Aurora, has the same illness.

In [[Chavo del Ocho]], the main character, El Chavo, would have cataleptic-like fits if frightened, where he would curl as if sitting down in a chair and become stiff. However, he could be healed by being splashed with water.

In the 1965 [[Roman Polanski]] film [[Repulsion]], [[Catherine Deneuve]]'s character shows signs of the affliction through her erratic and unexplainable behavior.

In two [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]] episodes, "[[Statistical Probabilities]]" and "[[Chrysalis (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Chrysalis]]", the character Sarina Douglas, a genetically-enhanced human woman, exhibits cataleptic symptoms.  In "Chrysalis", [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] promises to do everything he can to cure her of the disorder, and is ultimately successful.
