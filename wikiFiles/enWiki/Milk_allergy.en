A '''milk allergy''' is a [[food allergy]], an adverse [[Immune system|immune reaction]] to one or more of the constituents of milk from any animal (most commonly alpha S1-[[casein]], a [[protein]] in [[cow]]'s [[milk]]). This milk-induced allergic reaction can involve [[anaphylaxis]], a potentially life-threatening condition.

Milk allergy is distinct from [[lactose intolerance]]. 

== Allergen ==
A person with milk allergy can be reactive to one of dozens of the [[protein]]s within milk. The most common one is alpha S1-casein.<ref name=Chiropractic>{{cite journal|first=Editorial Staff|title=Goat's Milk: A Natural Alternative for Milk Sensitive Patients|journal=Dynamic Chiropractic|date=1 Dec 1997|year=1997|month=December|volume=15|issue=25|url=http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=38646|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>

Alpha S1-caseins differ between species. This explains why someone with an allergic reaction to sheep's milk cannot drink goat's milk but can drink breast milk without an allergic reaction.<ref>http://foodallergens.ifr.ac.uk/biochemical.lasso?selected_food=5000&allergenID=1041</ref>

== Symptoms ==
The principal symptoms are [[gastrointestinal]], [[dermatological]] and [[respiratory]]. These can translate to: [[skin rash]], [[hives]], [[vomiting]],  and [[Distress (medicine)|gastric distress]] such as [[diarrhea]], [[constipation]], rhinitis, [[stomach|stomach pain]] or [[flatulence]]. The clinical spectrum extends to diverse disorders: [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reactions]], [[atopic dermatitis]], [[wheeze]], [[baby colic|infantile colic]], [[gastroesophageal reflux]] (GER), [[oesophagitis]], [[colitis|allergic colitis]], [[headache]]/[[migraine]], oral irritation, and [[constipation]].

The symptoms may occur within a few minutes after exposure in ''immediate reactions'', or after hours (and in some cases after several days) in ''delayed reactions''.

== Difference between milk allergy and lactose intolerance ==
Milk allergy is a [[food allergy]], an adverse immune reaction to a food protein that is normally harmless to the non-allergic individual. [[Lactose intolerance]] is a non-allergic [[food sensitivity]], and comes from a lack of production of the [[enzyme]] [[lactase]], required to digest the predominant sugar in milk. Adverse effects of lactose intolerance generally occur after much higher levels of milk consumption than do adverse effects of milk allergy.

(Lactose intolerance is considered the normal state for most adults on a worldwide scale and is not typically considered to be a disease condition.<ref>http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/allergies/milk_allergy.html</ref>)

== Difference from milk protein intolerance ==
Milk protein intolerance (MPI) is delayed reaction to a food protein that is normally harmless to the non-allergic, non-intolerant individual.  Milk protein intolerance produces a non-IgE antibody and is not detected by allergy blood tests.  Milk protein intolerance produces a range of symptoms very similar to milk allergy symptoms, but can also include blood and/or mucus in the stool.  Treatment for milk protein intolerance is the same as for milk allergy.  Milk protein intolerance is also referred to as milk soy protein intolerance (MSPI).

It is commonplace for milk or milk derivatives to be included in processed foods such as bread, crackers, cookies, cakes, prepared meats, "soy cheese", soups, gravies, crisps, margarine, and products labeled "non-dairy", such as whipped topping and creamer (non-dairy simply means less than 0.5% milk by weight<ref>[http://www.godairyfree.org/Food-to-Eat/Food-Label-Info/Dairy-Ingredient-List.html Go Dairy Free | Dairy Ingredient List<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>).

It is also commonplace for milk derivatives, like casamino acid, to be in vaccines.

In some cases, heating the dairy product to force an exothermic chemical reaction can denature the proteins, (e.g. baking bread, or other baked goods). Only the ingredients that are chemically reacting will denature.

It is important to note that many processed foods that do not contain milk may be processed on equipment contaminated with dairy foods, which may cause an allergic reaction in some sensitive individuals.

===Milk avoidance and replacement for infants===
Since milk protein may be transferred from a breastfeeding mother to an allergic infant, [[lactating]] mothers of allergic infants can simply be put on a dairy elimination diet.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brill H |title=Approach to milk protein allergy in infants |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=54 |issue=9 |pages=1258–64 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18791102 |pmc=2553152 |url=http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18791102}}</ref> For formula fed infants, [[milk substitute]] formulas are used to provide a complete source of nutrition. Milk substitutes include soy based formulas, hypoallergenic formulas based on partially or extensively [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] protein, and free [[amino acid-based formula]]s.

Non-milk derived amino acid-based formulas, known as amino acid formulas or elemental formulas, are considered the gold standard in the treatment of cows milk allergy when the mother is unable to breastfeed.

Hydrolyzed formulas come in partially hydrolyzed and extensively hydrolyzed varieties. Partially hydrolyzed formulas (PHFs) are characterized by a larger proportion of long chain [[peptides]] and are considered more palatable. However, they are intended for milder cases and are not considered suitable for treatment of moderate to severe milk allergy or intolerance. Extensively hydrolyzed formulas (EHFs) are composed of proteins that have been largely broken down into free amino acids and short peptides. Casein and whey are the most commonly used sources of protein in hydrolyzed formulas because of their high nutritional quality and their amino acid composition.

Soy based formula may or may not pose a risk of allergic sensitivity, as some infants who are allergic to milk may also be allergic to soy.  Also soy based formula are not recommended for infants under 6 months{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. However, for infants with multiple allergies there are [[rice milk]] or [[oat milk]] based formulas available.

===Milk substitution for children and adults===
There are many commercially available replacements for milk for children and adults. Raw milk,  [[Rice milk]], [[soy milk]], [[oat milk]], [[coconut milk]] and [[almond milk]] are sometimes used as milk substitutes but are not suitable nutrition for infants. However, special [[infant formula]] based on [[soy]], [[rice]], [[almond]]s or carob seeds is commercially available. 

On an avoidance diet, it may be possible to reduce the longer-term risk of calcium deficiency and osteoporosis by incorporating other sources of calcium, although the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on osteoporosis is not always clear. There are fruit juices supplemented with calcium, [[sesame seeds]], [[hemp|hemp seeds]] and some kinds of [[tofu]]. They may, however, have other effects on health.

===Accidental exposure===
Treatment for accidental ingestion of milk products by allergic individuals varies depending on the sensitivity of the allergic person. Frequently medications such as an [[Epinephrine pen]] or an [[Antihistamine]] such as [[Diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl) are prescribed by an allergist in case of accidental ingestion. Milk allergy can cause [[anaphylaxis]], a severe, life threatening allergic reaction. 

Milk allergies are common in infants but are usually outgrown within the first 2–3 years of life.

== Statistics ==
Milk allergy is the most common food allergy in early childhood. It affects somewhere between 2% and 3% of infants in developed countries, but approximately 85–90% of affected children lose clinical reactivity to milk once they surpass 3 years of age.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)62120-5 |author=Høst A |title=Frequency of cow's milk allergy in childhood |journal=Ann.

Between 13% and 20% of children allergic to milk are also allergic to beef.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)62121-7 |author=Martelli A, De Chiara A, Corvo M, Restani P, Fiocchi A |title=Beef allergy in children with cow's milk allergy; cow's milk allergy in children with beef allergy |journal=Ann.
