'''Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL)''' is a class of [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], which is a type of [[cancer]] of the [[immune system]].  Unlike most non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (which are generally B-cell related), CTCL is caused by a mutation of [[T cell]]s.  The [[malignant]] T cells in the body initially migrate to the [[skin]], causing various [[lesion]]s to appear.  These lesions change shape as the disease progresses, typically beginning as what appears to be a [[rash]] which can be very itchy and eventually forming plaques and [[tumor]]s before [[metastasis|metastasizing]] to other parts of the body.

== Classification ==
Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas may be divided into the following types:<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi=|accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|727–740}}

A [[WHO]]-[[EORTC]] classification has been developed.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Willemze | first1 = R. | last2 = Jaffe | first2 = ES. | last3 = Burg | first3 = G. | last4 = Cerroni | first4 = L. | last5 = Berti | first5 = E. | last6 = Swerdlow | first6 = SH. | last7 = Ralfkiaer | first7 = E. | last8 = Chimenti | first8 = S. | last9 = Diaz-Perez | first9 = JL. | title = WHO-EORTC classification for cutaneous lymphomas. | journal = Blood | volume = 105 | issue = 10 | pages = 3768–85 | month = May | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3502 | PMID = 15692063 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Khamaysi | first1 = Z. | last2 = Ben-Arieh | first2 = Y. | last3 = Izhak | first3 = OB. | last4 = Epelbaum | first4 = R. | last5 = Dann | first5 = EJ. | last6 = Bergman | first6 = R. | title = The applicability of the new WHO-EORTC classification of primary cutaneous lymphomas to a single referral center. | journal = Am J Dermatopathol | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–44 | month = Feb | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1097/DAD.0b013e31815f9841 | PMID = 18212543 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no cure for CTCL, but there are a variety of treatment options available and some CTCL patients are able to live normal lives with this cancer, although symptoms can be debilitating and painful, even in earlier stages.

FDA approved treatments are :<ref>http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewnewspaged/articleid/3622028/pageid/1</ref>
*(1999) [[Denileukin diftitox]] (Ontak)
*(2000) [[Bexarotene]] (Targretin) a [[retinoid]]
*(2006) [[Vorinostat]] (Zolinza) a hydroxymate histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor
*(2009) [[Romidepsin]] (Istodax) a cyclic peptide histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor

Other (off label) Treatments include:
*Topical and oral [[corticosteroid]]s
*[[Bexarotene]] (Targretin) gel and capsules
*[[Carmustine]] (BCNU, a [[nitrosourea]])
*[[Mechlorethamine]] (Nitrogen Mustard)
*[[Phototherapy]] (Broad & Narrow Band UVB or PUVA)
*Local & Total Skin Electron Beam Radiation
*Conventional Radiation Therapy
*[[Photopheresis]]
*[[Interferon]]s
*[[Alemtuzumab]] (Campath-1H)
*[[Methotrexate]]
*[[Pentostatin]] and other purine analogues ([[Fludarabine]], 2-deoxychloroadenosine)
*Liposomal [[doxorubicin]] (Doxil)
*[[Gemcitabine]] (Gemzar)
*[[Cyclophosphamide]]
*Bone marrow / stem cells
*Allogenic [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]]
*[[Forodesine]] (Inhibits Purine Nucleoside phosphorylase)
Other drugs are under investigation (for example [[panobinostat]] and [[Resimmune]]).

In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted orphan drug designation for a topical treatment for pruritus in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to a pharmaceutical company called Elorac.<ref name="CTCL">[http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20101130005333/en/Elorac-Announces-Orphan-Drug-Designation-Topical-Treatment Elorac, Inc.
