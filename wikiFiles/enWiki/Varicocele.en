'''Varicocele''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ær|ɨ|k|ɵ|s|iː|l}} is an abnormal enlargement of the [[pampiniform venous plexus]] in the scrotum. This plexus of veins drains the testicles. The testicular [[blood vessels]] originate in the abdomen and course down through the [[inguinal canal]] as part of the [[spermatic cord]] on their way to the [[testis]]. Upward flow of blood in the veins is ensured by small one-way valves that prevent backflow. Defective valves, or compression of the vein by a nearby structure, can cause dilatation of the testicular veins near the testis, leading to the formation of a varicocele.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of a varicocele may include:
* Dragging-like or aching pain within [[scrotum]].
* Feeling of heaviness in the testicle(s)
* Atrophy (shrinking) of the testicle(s)
* Low testosterone.
* Visible or palpable (able to be felt) enlarged vein<ref>[http://www.urologychannel.com/varicocele/symptoms.shtml Urologychannel: Varicoele], retrieved October 21, 2006</ref>

==Cause==

The '''[[idiopathic]] varicocele''' occurs when the valves within the veins along the spermatic cord do not work properly. This is essentially the same process as [[varicose veins]], which are common in the legs.  This results in backflow of blood into the [[pampiniform plexus]] and causes increased pressures, ultimately leading to permanent damage to the testicular tissue due to disruption of normal supply of  oxygenated blood via the testicular artery.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Varicoceles develop slowly and may not have any symptoms. They are most frequently diagnosed when a patient is 15–30 years of age, and rarely develop after the age of 40.  They occur in 15-20% of all males.  

98% of idiopathic varicoceles occur on the left side, apparently because the left [[testicular vein]] connects to the [[renal vein]] (and does so at a 90-degree angle), while the right testicular vein drains at less than 90-degrees directly into the significantly larger [[inferior vena cava]]. Isolated right sided varicoceles are rare.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

A '''secondary varicocele''' is  due to compression of the venous drainage of the testicle.  A pelvic or abdominal malignancy is a definite concern when a right-sided varicocele is newly diagnosed in a patient older than 40 years of age.  One non-malignant cause of a secondary varicocele is the so-called "[[Nutcracker syndrome]]", a condition in which the [[superior mesenteric artery]] compresses the left renal vein, causing increased pressures there to be transmitted retrograde into the left pampiniform plexus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rudloff U, Holmes RJ, Prem JT, Faust GR, Moldwin R, Siegel D |title=Mesoaortic compression of the left renal vein (nutcracker syndrome): case reports and review of the literature |journal=Annals of vascular surgery |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=120–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16374539 |doi=10.1007/s10016-005-5016-8}}</ref> The most common cause is [[renal cell carcinoma]] (a.k.a. hypernephroma) followed by retroperitoneal fibrosis or adhesions.

==Pathophysiology==
The term varicocele specifically refers to dilatation and tortuosity of the [[pampiniform plexus]], which is the network of veins that drain the testicle.  This plexus travels along the posterior portion of the testicle with the epididymis and vas deferens, and then into the spermatic cord.  This network of veins coalesces into the [[Testicular vein|gonadal, or testicular, vein]].  The right gonadal vein drains into the [[inferior vena cava]], while the left gonadal vein drains into the left [[renal vein]] at right angle to the renal vein, which then drains into the inferior vena cava. One of the main functions of the plexus is to lower the temperature of the testicles; vericocele causes this function to be lost, hence the most common complication of untreated vericocele is higher temperature of the testes, resulting in testicular atrophy causing infertility.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The small vessels of the pampiniform plexus normally range from 0.5–1.5&nbsp;mm in diameter.  Dilation of these vessels greater than 2&nbsp;mm is called a varicocele.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Recent studies have shown that the detrimental effect of varicocele on sperm production is progressive and due to reduction in supply of oxygenated blood and nutrient material to the sperm production sites, which persistently reduces the quality and the quantity of the sperms, leading to reduction in their fertility capacity with time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Diagnosis==

Upon palpation of the scrotum, a non-tender, twisted mass along the spermatic cord is felt. Palpating a varicocele can be likened to feeling a bag of worms.<ref name="moore">{{cite book |author=Moore, Keith L.; Dalley, Arthur F. |title=Clinically Oriented Anatomy |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year=2006 |page=228 |edition=5th}}</ref>
When lying down, gravity may allow the drainage of the [[pampiniform plexus]] and thus make the mass not obvious.<ref name="moore"/> This is especially true in primary varicocele, and absence may be a sign for clinical concern.<ref name="moore"/> The testicle on the side of the varicocele may or may not be smaller compared to the other side.

Varicocele can be reliably diagnosed with [[ultrasound]],<ref name="pmid17962950">{{cite journal |author=Bucci S, Liguori G, Amodeo A, Salamè L, Trombetta C, Belgrano E |title=Intratesticular varicocele: evaluation using grey scale and color Doppler ultrasound |journal= World Journal of Urology|volume= 26|issue= 1|pages= 87–9|year=2007 |pmid=17962950 |doi=10.1007/s00345-007-0216-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Charboneau, J. William; Rumack, Carol M; Wilson, Stephanie R. |title=Diagnostic ultrasound |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=1998 |isbn=0-8151-8683-5 }}</ref> which will show dilation of the vessels of the pampiniform plexus to greater than 2&nbsp;mm.  The patient being studied should undergo a provocative maneuver, such as [[Valsalva's maneuver]] (straining, like he is trying to have a bowel movement) or standing up during the exam, both of which are designed to increase intra-abdominal venous pressure and increase the dilatation of the veins.  Doppler ultrasound is a technique of measuring the speed at which blood is flowing in a vessel.  An ultrasound machine that has a Doppler mode can see blood reverse direction in a varicocele with a Valsalva, increasing the sensitivity of the examination.

Recent studies have shown that varicocele is a bilateral disease<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gat Y, Bachar GN, Zukerman Z, Belenky A, Gornish M |title=Varicocele: a bilateral disease |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=424–9 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14967384 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2003.08.010 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028203028486}}</ref>  and the diagnosis of the right side is missed by physical examination and even by ultrasonography.
The examination should be performed by ultrasonography — color flow doppler performed by highly experienced sonographer or radiologist that will diagnose varicocele by demonstrating back-flow in the right and in the left spermatic veins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gat Y, Bachar GN, Zukerman Z, Belenky A, Gorenish M |title=Physical examination may miss the diagnosis of bilateral varicocele: a comparative study of 4 diagnostic modalities |journal=J. Urol. |volume=172 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=1414–7 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15371858 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/00005392-200410000-00049 |doi=10.1097/01.ju.0000138540.57137.5f}}</ref>

==To treat or not?==
The recent [[Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews|Cochrane Database Systematic Review]] of eight [[randomised controlled trials]] on this topic suggests that treatment can improve semen count, but not fertility (ie rates of pregnancy). This is an area of ongoing controversy.

Treatment is generally reserved for those with symptomatic varicocele, a discrepancy in testicular size or marked semen abnormalities in patients with a palpable varicocele at rest.

==Possible treatment==
[[File:Sew up wound after varicocele surgery.jpg|thumb|Sewn up wound after varicocele surgery]]

Varicocelectomy, the surgical correction of a varicocele, is performed on an [[Outpatient surgery|outpatient]] basis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hsu GL, Ling PY, Hsieh CH, ''et al.'' |title=Outpatient varicocelectomy performed under local anesthesia |journal=Asian J. Androl. |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=439–44 |year=2005 |pmid=16281094 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-7262.2005.00080.x}}</ref> The three most common approaches are [[Groin|inguinal]] (groin), [[retroperitoneal]] (abdominal), and infrainguinal/subinguinal (below the groin). Various other techniques may be used. Ice packs should be kept to the area for the first 2 days after [[surgery]] to reduce swelling. The patient may be advised to wear a scrotal support for some time after surgery.</br>
Possible complications of this procedure include [[hematoma]] (bleeding into tissues), [[hydrocele]] (accumulation of fluid around the affected testicle), [[infection]], or injury to the scrotal tissue or structures. In addition, injury to the artery that supplies the testicle may occur.

In the ''Gat-Goren nonsurgical method'' for treating varicoceles, performed under [[local anesthesia]], a [[catheter]] is inserted through a vein in the upper thigh. Fluid injected through the catheter selectively closes off the malfunctioning veins, thus enabling the testicular tissues to recover and begin to produce normal sperm in normal amounts. The procedure lasts one to two hours and causes almost no discomfort. The patient can return to his regular routine in about 5 days.<ref>[http://www.pirion.co.il/htmls/article1e.html Pirion.co.il]</ref>

[[File:IMG 1775.JPG|thumb|Picture taken 36 hours after embolization treating a varicocele. It shows the place where the wire was passed through.]]

An alternative to surgery is [[embolization]],<ref name="pmid-17277247">{{cite journal |author=Costanza M, Policha A, Amankwah K, Gahtan V |title=Treatment of bleeding varicose veins of the scrotum with percutaneous coil embolization of the left spermatic vein: a case report |journal=Vascular and endovascular surgery |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=73–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17277247 |doi=10.1177/1538574406296074}}</ref> a minimally invasive treatment for varicocele that is performed by an [[interventional radiologist]].  This involves passing a small wire through a peripheral vein and into the abdominal veins that drain the testes.  Through a small flexible [[catheter]], the doctor can obstruct the veins so that the increased pressures from the abdomen are no longer transmitted to the testicles.  The testicles then drain through smaller collateral veins. The recovery period is significantly less than with surgery and the risk of complications is minimised with overall effectiveness similar to surgery, yet with fewer recurrence rates.

Embolization is an effective treatment for post-surgical varicoceles. These are varicoceles that reappear after they have been surgically repaired. The main theory is the presence of redundant gonadal veins that provide collateralization cause the reappearance of the varicoceles. The use of NBCA glues during the embolization is as effective at embolizing these collaterals as coils.<ref name="pmid-18375298">{{cite journal |author=Sze DY, Kao JS, ''et al.'' |title=Persistent and recurrent postsurgical varicoceles: venographic anatomy and treatment with N-butyl cyanoacrylate embolization

Medical treatment with [[L-carnitine]] has some beneficial effect on sperm parameters, but is not as effective as surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Seo JT, Kim KT, Moon MH, Kim WT |title=The significance of microsurgical varicocelectomy in the treatment of subclinical varicocele |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=1907–10 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=19249033 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.118 }}</ref> Micronised purified flavonoid fractions (MPFF)(Daflon) have a beneficial effect on reducing varicocele pain and reducing reflux time of left spermatic vein during the Valsalva maneuver.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Söylemez H, Kiliç S, Atar M, Penbegül N, Sancaktutar AA, Bozkurt Y |title=Effects of micronised purified flavonoid fraction on pain, semen analysis and scrotal color Doppler parameters in patients with painful varicocele; results of a randomized placebo-controlled study. |journal=Int Urol Nephrol. |pmid=21805085 |doi=10.1007/s11255-011-0038-3 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11255-011-0038-3 |volume=44 |issue=2 |year=2012 |month=April |pages=401–8}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Varicocele can be harmless, but in many cases it can cause infertility and pain. Although there are studies showing improvement in sperm quality in 57%,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mordel N, Mor-Yosef S, Margalioth EF ''et al.'' | year = 1990 | title = Spermatic vein ligation as treatment for male infertility: justification by post-operative semen improvement and pregnancy rates | url = | journal = J Reprod Med | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 123–27 }}</ref> there are also studies showing that the regular surgery has no significant effect on infertility. Thus the surgery may not improve fertility and the patient will need to undergo a non-invasive treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Evers JLH, Collins JA | year = 2003 | title = Assessment of efficacy of varicocele repair for male subfertility: a systematic review | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = | pages = 1849–52 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13503-9}}</ref><ref>2.Evers JLH, Collins JA, Vandekerckhove P .
