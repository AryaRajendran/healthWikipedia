'''William Perfect''' (1737-1809) was a British [[physician]], [[obstetrician]], early [[psychiatrist]], [[Freemason]], and [[poet]].  

He was born in [[Oxfordshire, England]], the son of a clergyman in [[Kent]].  In 1749, Perfect apprenticed under [[William Everred]], a London [[surgeon]], for seven years and attended lectures by [[Colin MacKenzie]], a Scottish obstetrician.  He opened his obstetric practice in Kent in 1756, and he obtained his Medicinae Doctor (M.D.) from [[St. Andrews University]] in 1783.  He published three editions of his book, ''Cases in Midwifery'', and each edition contained case reports describing in detail the conditions of the patients and the treatments which were administered.  

In the 1760s, Perfect began to accommodate mentally ill people in his home, a practice that continued until his death in 1809, when his son George took over until 1815.  The [[West Malling Asylum]] in Kent continued to function through the 20th century as a principal private mental hospital in the country.

''The Annals of Insanity'' is a series of psychiatric case reports.  In the first edition in 1809, Perfect wrote that he was presenting the results of his practice and observations.  In advertising the second edition, he offered a revised, corrected, and enlarged book.  Cases of [[mania]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] were described in detail as well as cases of [[alcoholism]], and attempted and successful [[suicides]].  The treatments prescribed to patients were recorded in detail, including the medications prescribed by the physician.  [[Electricity]] was used with good results in some cases.  He was convinced of the role of heredity, and recognized the involvement of the brain, its vessels, and its membranes.  In one case report, he noted how “gentle treatment contributed much to the case and should always be adopted in preference to rigorous measures (where possible)… The proper management … is more to be depended upon than medicine, but when both are judicially and humanely blended, the patient has always the best chance of recovery.” 

Perfect joined the Freemasons in 1765 and became Grand Master of his lodge until his death.  In 1795, the Freemason magazine published his memoirs.  He published prose and poetry: ''A Bevin of Bays'' in 1763, and a two-volume collection, ''Laurel Wreath'', in 1766.  

Perfect died in June 1809.
