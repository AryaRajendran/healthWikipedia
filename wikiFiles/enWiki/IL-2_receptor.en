The '''interleukin-2 receptor''' ('''IL-2R''') is a [[trimer (biochemistry)|heterotrimeric]] protein expressed on the surface of certain immune cells, such as [[lymphocyte]]s, that binds and responds to a [[cytokine]] called IL-2.  The IL-2R is made up of 3 subunits - α (CD25), β (CD122) and γ (CD132) - [[non-covalent]]ly associating.  The α and β chains are involved in binding IL-2, while [[signal transduction]] following cytokine interaction is carried out by the γ-chain, along with the β subunit.  The β and γ chains of the IL-2R are members of the [[type I cytokine receptor]] family.

==Discovery and characterization==

The IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) was the first [[interleukin]] receptor to be described and characterized by Kendall Smith and his team at Dartmouth Medical School.<ref name="pmid6975347">{{cite journal | author = Robb RJ, Munck A, Smith KA | title = T cell growth factor receptors.

==Structure-activity relationships of the IL-2/IL-2R interaction==
{{unclear|date=April 2012}}
Detailed experiments over a decade (1990s) using a rigorous reductionist approach with isolated purified receptor chains and [[Surface plasmon resonance]] revealed that the alpha chain of the IL-2R can bind to the beta chain before receptor interaction with IL-2, and that the IL-2Rα/β heterodimer formed has a faster association rate and a slower dissociation rate when binding IL-2 versus either chain alone.<ref name="pmid10556880">{{cite journal | author = Liparoto SF, Ciardelli TL | title = Biosensor analysis of the interleukin-2 receptor complex | journal = J.

These data were recently confirmed and extended by energetics experiments using [[Isothermal Titration Calorimetry]] and Multi-Angle Light [[Scattering]].<ref name="pmid15178252">{{cite journal | author = Rickert M, Boulanger MJ, Goriatcheva N, Garcia KC | title = Compensatory energetic mechanisms mediating the assembly of signaling complexes between interleukin-2 and its alpha, beta, and gamma(c) receptors | journal = J.

The 3-dimensional structure of the three IL-2R chains binding IL-2 was determined by [[X-ray crystallography]].<ref name="pmid16293754">{{cite journal | author = Wang X, Rickert M, Garcia KC | title = Structure of the quaternary complex of interleukin-2 with its alpha, beta, and gammac receptors | journal = Science | volume = 310 | issue = 5751 | pages = 1159–63 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16293754 | doi = 10.1126/science.1117893 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16477002">{{cite journal | author = Stauber DJ, Debler EW, Horton PA, Smith KA, Wilson IA | title = Crystal structure of the IL-2 signaling complex: paradigm for a heterotrimeric cytokine receptor | journal = Proc.

The sites on the IL-2 molecule that interact with the three receptor chains do not overlap, except for a small but significant region. The IL-2 molecule is composed of four antiparallel [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] and it is held between the beta and gamma chains, which converge to form a Y shape; IL-2 is held in the fork of the Y. The other side of the IL-2 molecule binds to the IL-2R alpha chain.  The alpha chain itself does not contact either beta or gamma chain of the IL-2R. Following the binding of IL-2, the beta chain undergoes a conformational change that evidently increases its affinity for the gamma chain, thereby attracting it to form a stable quaternary molecular complex.

==Signaling==

The three IL-2 receptor chains span the [[cell membrane]] and extend into the cell, thereby delivering biochemical signals to the cell interior. The alpha chain does not participate in signaling, but the beta chain is complexed with an [[enzyme]] called [[Janus kinase 1]] (JAK1), that is capable of adding phosphate groups to molecules.  Similarly the gamma chain  complexes with another [[tyrosine kinase]] called [[Janus kinase|JAK3]].<ref name="pmid7514277">{{cite journal | author = Nelson BH, Lord JD, Greenberg PD | title = Cytoplasmic domains of the interleukin-2 receptor beta and gamma chains mediate the signal for T-cell proliferation | journal = Nature | volume = 369 | issue = 6478 | pages = 333–6 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7514277 | doi = 10.1038/369333a0 }}</ref><ref name="pmid7973658">{{cite journal | author = Russell SM, Johnston JA, Noguchi M, Kawamura M, Bacon CM, Friedmann M, Berg M, McVicar DW, Witthuhn BA, Silvennoinen O | title = Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5187 | pages = 1042–5 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7973658 | doi = 10.1126/science.7973658 }}</ref> These enzymes are activated by IL-2 binding to the external domains of the IL-2R.

==T cell proliferation==

Once IL-2 binds to the external domains of the IL-2R and the cytoplasmic domains are engaged, signaling continues until the IL-2/IL-2R complex is internalized and degraded. However, each cell only decides to make the irrevocable commitment to replicate its DNA and undergo mitosis and [[cytokinesis]] when a critical number of IL-2Rs have been triggered.<ref name="pmid6427923">{{cite journal | author = Cantrell DA, Smith KA | title = The interleukin-2 T-cell system: a new cell growth model | journal = Science | volume = 224 | issue = 4655 | pages = 1312–6 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6427923 | doi = 10.1126/science.6427923 }}</ref> Given that the half-time for internalization of IL-2 occupied IL-2Rs is ~ 15 minutes,<ref name="pmid2688708">{{cite journal | author = Smith KA | title = The interleukin 2 receptor | journal = Annu.

Thus, the critical number of triggered IL-2Rs is ~ 30,000. In as much that the mean number of high affinity IL-2Rs on antigen-activated T cells is only ~ 1,000, it appears that new receptors must be synthesized before the cell makes the quantal, all-or-none decision to  divide.<ref name="pmid16467871">{{cite journal | author = Smith KA | title = The quantal theory of immunity | journal = Cell Res. | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–9 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16467871 | doi = 10.1038/sj.cr.7310003 }}</ref> Accordingly, a mean of at least 11 hours of IL-2/IL-2R interaction are necessary before a cell decides to undergo DNA replication.

Until recently, the intracellular molecules activated by the IL-2R at the cell membrane that are responsible for promoting cell cycle progression were obscure. However, early on it was shown that IL-2Rs triggered the expression of [[cyclin]] D2 and cyclin D3.<ref name="pmid8268127">{{cite journal | author = Turner JM | title = IL-2-dependent induction of G1 cyclins in primary T cells is not blocked by rapamycin or cyclosporin A | journal = Int.

The IL-2R also signals negative feedback loops that function to inhibit IL-2 gene expression. These loops either shut down signaling via the T cell antigen receptor by activating the expression of CTLA-4, or by activating the expression of FOXP3, which as a negative regulator of IL-2 transcription operates at the level of the IL-2 promoter. 

Other recent data indicate that T cells that express FOXP3 (T regulatory cells) can suppress other T  cells by binding IL-2 via the high affinity IL-2R, and followed by internalization of the quaternary IL-2/IL-2R complex, degrade IL-2. Thus, the concentration of IL-2 available determines the tempo, magnitude and extent of T cell immune responses.

==Clinical implications==
Drugs that inhibit IL-2 receptors, such as [[basiliximab]] and [[daclizumab]] are used in conjunction with other drugs to prevent [[Transplant rejection|immune rejection of transplants]].
