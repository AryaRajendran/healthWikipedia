'''Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy''' is an [[Endoscopy|endoscopic]] [[medical procedure]] in which a tube ('''PEG tube''') is passed into a patient's stomach through the [[abdominal wall]], most commonly to provide a means of feeding when [[Mouth|oral]] intake is not adequate. The procedure is an alternative to surgical [[gastrostomy]] insertion, and does not require a [[general anesthetic]]; [[Procedural sedation and analgesia|mild sedation]] is typically used. PEG tubes may also be extended into the [[small intestine]] by passing a jejunal extension tube ('''PEG-J tube''') through the PEG tube and into the [[jejunum]] via the [[pylorus]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Discussion |work=BCM Gastroenterology Grand Rounds |publisher=Baylor College of Medicine |url=http://www.bcm.edu/gastro/DDC/grandrounds/BCM/8-10-06/09-DISC.HTM}}</ref>

PEG administration of enteral feeds is the most commonly used method of nutritional support for patients in the community. Many [[stroke]] patients, for example, are at risk of [[aspiration pneumonia]] due to poor control over the swallowing muscles; some will benefit from a PEG performed to maintain nutrition. PEGs may also be inserted to decompress the [[stomach]] in cases of [[volvulus|gastric volvulus]].<ref name=Gauderer01>{{cite journal |author=Gauderer MW |title=Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-20 years later: a historical perspective |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=217–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11150469 |doi=10.1053/jpsu.2001.20058}}</ref>

==Indications==
Gastrostomy may be indicated in numerous situations, usually those in which normal or nutrition (or [[nasogastric tube|nasogastric]]) feeding is impossible. The causes for these situations may be neurological (e.g. [[stroke]]), anatomical (e.g. [[cleft lip and palate]] during the process of correction) or other (e.g. [[radiation therapy]] for tumors in head & neck region).

In certain situations where normal or nasogastric feeding is not possible, gastrostomy may be of no clinical benefit. In advanced [[dementia]], studies show that PEG placement does not in fact prolong life.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murphy LM, Lipman TO |title=Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy does not prolong survival in patients with dementia |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=163 |issue=11 |pages=1351–3 |year=2003 |pmid=12796072 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.11.1351}}</ref> Quality improvement protocols have been developed with the aim of reducing the number of non-beneficial gastrostomies in patients with dementia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Monteleoni C, Clark E |title=Using rapid-cycle quality improvement methodology to reduce feeding tubes in patients with advanced dementia: before and after study |journal=BMJ |volume=329 |issue=7464 |pages=491–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15331474 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7464.491 |pmc=515202}}</ref>

A gastrostomy can be placed to decompress the stomach contents in a patient with a malignant bowel obstruction. This is referred to as a "venting PEG" and is placed to prevent and manage nausea and vomiting.

A gastrostomy can also be used to treat [[volvulus]] of the stomach, where the stomach twists along one of its axes.  The tube (or multiple tubes) is used for gastropexy, or adhering the stomach to the abdominal wall, preventing twisting of the stomach.<ref name=Gauderer01/>

A PEG tube can be used in providing gastric or post-surgical drainage.<ref>Gail Waldby, "PEG-J Gastrostomy drainage jejunal feeding tubes" http://surgnurseslinks.com/caluso.htm</ref>

==Techniques==
[[Image:PEG tube kit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|PEG tube, cannula and guidewire (Pull Technique)]]
Two major techniques for placing PEGs have been described in the literature.

The Gauderer-Ponsky technique involves performing a [[gastroscopy]] to evaluate the [[anatomy]] of the [[stomach]].  The anterior stomach wall is identified and techniques are used to ensure that there is no [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] between the wall and the [[skin]]:
* digital pressure is applied to the abdominal wall, which can be seen indenting the anterior gastric wall by the endoscopist.
* transillumination (diaphanoscopy): the light emitted from the endoscope within the stomach can be seen through the abdominal wall.
* a small (21G, 40mm) needle is passed into the stomach before the larger cannula is passed.
An [[catheter|angiocath]] is used to puncture the abdominal wall through a small [[incision]], and a soft guidewire is inserted through this and pulled out of the [[mouth]].  The feeding tube is attached to the guidewire and pulled through the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and out of the incision.<ref name=Gauderer01/>

In the Russell introducer technique, the [[Seldinger technique]] is used to place a wire into the stomach, and a series of dilators are used to increase the size of the [[gastrostomy]].  The tube is then pushed in over the wire.<ref name="pmid3349370">{{cite journal |author=Deitel M, Bendago M, Spratt EH, Burul CJ, To TB |title=Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy by the "pull" and "introducer" methods |journal=Can J Surg |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=102–4 |year=1988 |pmid=3349370 |doi=}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
As with the case of other types of feeding tubes, care must be made to place PEGs into an appropriate population.  The following are contraindications to PEG use:<ref>Gastroenterological endoscopy. Meinhard Classen, G. N. J. Tytgat, Charles J. Lightdale. 2002. ISBN 978-1-58890-013-5</ref>

===Absolute contraindications===
* Inability to perform an [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]]
* Uncorrected [[coagulopathy]]
* [[Peritonitis]]
* Untreatable (loculated) massive [[ascites]]
* [[Bowel obstruction]] (unless the PEG is sited to provide drainage)

===Relative contraindications===
* Massive [[ascites]]
* Gastric mucosal abnormalities: large [[gastric varices]], portal hypertensive gastropathy
* Previous [[abdominal surgery]], including previous partial [[gastrectomy]]: increased risk of organs interposed between gastric wall and abdominal wall
* [[Morbid obesity]]: difficulties in locating stomach position by digital indentation of stomach and transillumination
* Gastric wall [[neoplasm]]
* Abdominal wall [[infection]]: increased risk of infection of PEG site
* Intra-abdmominal malignancy with peritoneal involvement (tumor seeding into formed channel with subsequent failure)

==Complications==
* [[Cellulitis]] (infection of the skin) around the gastrostomy site
* [[Haemorrhage]]
* [[Gastric ulcer]] either at the site of the button or on the opposite wall of the stomach ("kissing ulcer")
* Perforation of [[Intestine|bowel]] (most commonly [[transverse colon]]) leading to [[peritonitis]]
* Puncture of the left lobe of the [[liver]] leading to liver capsule pain
* Gastrocolic fistula: this may be suspected if diarrhea appears a short time after feeding. In this case, the feed goes direct from stomach to colon (usually [[transverse colon]])
* Gastric separation
* "Buried bumper syndrome" (the gastric part of the tube migrates into the gastric wall)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walters G, Ramesh P, Memon MI |title=Buried Bumper Syndrome complicated by intra-abdominal sepsis |journal=Age and ageing |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=650–1 |year=2005 |pmid=16267197 |doi=10.1093/ageing/afi204}}</ref>

==Removal of PEG tubes==
[[Image:PEG removal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Endoscopic removal of PEG tube]]

===Indications===
* PEG tube no longer required (recovery of swallow after [[stroke]] or surgery for [[head and neck cancer]])
* Persistent infection of PEG site
* Failure, breakage or deterioration of PEG tube (a new tube can be sited along the existing track)
* "Buried bumper syndrome"

===Techniques===
PEG tubes with rigid, fixed "bumpers" are removed endoscopically. The PEG tube is pushed into the stomach so that part of the tube is visible behind the bumper. An endoscopy snare is then passed through the endoscope, and passed over the bumper so that the tube adjacent to the bumper is grasped. The external part of the tube is then cut, and the tube is withdrawn into the stomach, and then pulled up into the oesophagus and removed through the mouth. The PEG site heals without intervention.

PEG tubes with a collapsible or deflatable bumper can be removed using traction (simply by pulling the PEG tube out through the abdominal wall).

==History==
The first percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy performed on a child was on June 12, 1979 at the [[Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital]], [[University Hospitals of Cleveland]]. Dr. Michael W.L. Gauderer, pediatric surgeon, Dr. Jeffrey Ponsky, endoscopist, and Dr. James Bekeny, surgical resident, performed the procedure on a four-and-one-half-month old child with inadequate oral intake]].<ref name=Gauderer80>{{cite journal |author=Gauderer MW, Ponsky JL, Izant RJ |title=Gastrostomy without laparotomy: a percutaneous endoscopic technique |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=872–5 |year=1980 |pmid=6780678 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3468(80)80296-X}}</ref> The authors of the technique, Dr. Michael W.L. Gauderer and Dr. Jeffrey Ponsky, first published the technique in 1980.<ref name=Gauderer80/> In 2001, the details of the development of the procedure were published, the first author being the originator of the technique itself.<ref name=Gauderer01/>
