'''Anti-dsDNA antibodies''' are a group of [[anti-nuclear antibodies]] and their target [[antigen]] is double stranded [[DNA]]. Blood tests such as [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA) and immunofluorescence are routinely performed to detect anti-dsDNA antibodies in diagnostic laboratories. They are highly diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are implicated in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.<ref name="pmid10629135">{{cite journal |author=Kavanaugh A, Tomar R, Reveille J, Solomon DH, Homburger HA |title=Guidelines for clinical use of the antinuclear antibody test and tests for specific autoantibodies to nuclear antigens.

==Discovery==

The first evidence for antinuclear antibodies arose in 1948 when Hargraves, Richmond and Morton discovered the [[LE cell]].<ref name="pmid18921142">{{cite journal |author=Hargraves MM,Richmond H,Morton R |title=Presentation of two bone marrow elements; the tart cell and the L.E. cell |journal=Proceedings of the Staff Meetings.

==Antibody production==

Although the exact mechanism of the generation of dsDNA antibodies is still unknown, it is likely that extracellular DNA is one cause of an [[immune response]] against dsDNA. There is a great deal of evidence supporting the idea that dead or dying cells are one major source of this extracellular DNA.<ref name= "pmid19703007">{{cite journal |author=Su KY, Pisetsky DS |title=The role of extracellular DNA in autoimmunity in SLE |journal=Scand. J. Immunol. |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=175–83 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19703007 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3083.2009.02300.x |url=}}</ref> [[Apoptosis]] is the highly organised process of programmed cell death in which the cell degrades the nuclear DNA and signals for phagocytosis. In people with SLE and other autoimmune disorders this process is thought to be defective, causing either an increase in cell death and/or a decrease in the rate of dead cell clearance.<ref name = "pmid14736945">{{cite journal |author=Dieker JW, van der Vlag J, Berden JH |title=Deranged removal of apoptotic cells: its role in the genesis of lupus|journal=Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=282–5 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14736945 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

There is a higher rate of apoptosis in people with SLE and various changes in genes and proteins have been implicated in the defects in apoptosis. These include increased levels of soluble [[Fas receptor|Fas]] and [[bcl-2]] and polymorphisms in the [[programmed cell death 1]] and [[RUNX1|run-related transcription factor X1]].<ref name = "pmid14736945"/>

[[Bleb (cell biology)|Bleb]]s on apoptotic cells contain nearly all the autoantigens found in SLE, and phagocytes bind these apoptotic cells and phagocytose them. If this process is defective, these autoantigens can be released into the circulation allowing an immune response. [[Serum amyloid P component]] is a protein that is thought to aid in the clearance of chromatin produced by apoptotic cells and deficiencies in this protein have been shown (in mice) to cause spontaneous formation of ANA. Autoantigens present on the blebs of apoptotic cells are also prone to modification, which can increase their [[immunogenicity]].<ref name = "pmid14736945"/><ref name="pmid1088701">{{cite journal |author=Smeenk RJ |title=Antinuclear antibodies: cause of disease or caused by disease? |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford)|volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=581–4 |year=2000 |month=June |pmid=10888701 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Upon release of nuclear proteins and chromatin, [[antigen presenting cells]], such as [[dendritic cells]] and [[macrophages]], display these antigens to [[T helper cells]]. Although the details of this process are still controversial, evidence shows that to produce an immune response, DNA must activate an antigen presenting cell to produce [[Interferon type 1|type 1 interferons]]. This cytokine serves to maturate [[plasmacytoid dendritic cell]]s (PDCs) so that they can display their antigens to T helper cells. The mechanism in which eukaryotic DNA activates these cells is still as yet unclear; however, immunogenic CpG sequences have been found to either activate PDCs or act as adjuvant in the response to eukaryotic DNA. CpG motif DNA acts via the [[pattern recognition receptor]], [[toll-like receptor 9]], found highly expressed in PDCs and B cells. The T helper cells then activate B cells, which are also in the presence of these antigens, causing the production of autoantibodies.<ref name= "pmid19703007">{{cite journal |author=Su KY, Pisetsky DS |title=The role of extracellular DNA in autoimmunity in SLE |journal=Scand.

Anti-dsDNA antibodies can also be produced through infection via a mechanism known as [[molecular mimicry]]. Upon exposure to pneumococcal polysaccharides, cross reactive antibodies between dsDNA and pneumococcal polysaccharides are produced in lupus.<ref name = "pmid17426366">{{cite journal |author=Blank M, Barzilai O, Shoenfeld Y |title=Molecular mimicry and auto-immunity |journal=Clin Rev Allergy Immunol|volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=111–8 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17426366 |doi= |url=}}</ref> [[Epstein-Barr virus]] is also known to induce dsDNA antibodies, as seen after immunisation of animals with [[EBNA-1]] epitopes.<ref name="pmid16455583">{{cite journal |author=Poole BD, Scofield RH, Harley JB, James JA |title=Epstein-Barr virus and molecular mimicry in systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=Autoimmunity|volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=63–70 |year=2006 |month=February|pmid=16455583 |doi=10.1080/08916930500484849 |url=}}</ref>

Anti-dsDNA antibodies might also be created secondary to the production of antibodies to other proteins within the [[nucleosome]]. Mice that have T cells directed towards the nucleosome can illicit a response to other antigens such as dsDNA and histone via a mechanism known as [[epitope spreading|antigen spreading]]. This effect can also occur after an infection causes the production of autoantibodies to other structures within the nucleus.<ref name="pmid16455583"/><ref name="pmid14628957">{{cite journal |author=Berden JH |title=Lupus nephritis: consequence of disturbed removal of apoptotic cells? |journal=Neth J Med |volume=61|issue=8 |pages=233–8 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=14628957 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Role in disease==

===SLE===

Anti-dsDNA antibodies are incredibly [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] for SLE, with studies quoting nearly 100%, and are therefore used in the diagnosis of SLE. Higher titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies are more suggestive of SLE and lower titres can be found in people without the disease. In contrast to the high specificity, estimates of 25-85% have been observed for the [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of anti-dsDNA in SLE. Therefore, presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies are suggestive of SLE, however an absence of the antibodies do not rule out the disease.<ref name="pmid10629135"/>

The levels of circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies fluctuate with disease activity in SLE. Increases in titres of the antibodies can coincide with, or even precede an increase of disease activity. For this reason titres are serially monitored by clinicians to assess disease progression. Titres are monitored more often in cases of more active lupus than that of less active lupus at intervals of 1–3 months and 6–12 months, respectively.<ref name="pmid10629135"/>

Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly associated with [[glomerulonephritis]] in SLE, although some patients with high titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies do not develop renal disease. This is most likely due to the fact that anti-dsDNA are a heterogeneous population, some of which have been found not to be pathogenic. Anti-dsDNA antibodies can be present in normal individuals, however these antibodies are usually low avidity [[IgM]] isotype. In contrast, pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies found in SLE are usually of [[IgG]] isotype and show high avidity for dsDNA.<ref name="pmid10911799">{{cite journal |author=Egner W |title=The use of laboratory tests in the diagnosis of SLE |journal=J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=424–32 |year=2000 |month=June |pmid=10911799 |pmc=1731203 |doi= |url=}}</ref> One possible mechanism for anti-dsDNA and their role in nephritis is the formation of immune complexes that arise by indirect binding to DNA or nucleosomes that are adhered to the [[glomerular basement membrane]] (GBM). Another mechanism is direct binding of antibodies to GBM antigens such as [[C1q]], nucleosomal proteins, heparin sulphate or [[laminin]], which can initiate an inflammatory response by activating complement. They can also be internalised by certain molecules on the GBM cells and cause inflammatory cascades, proliferation and alteration of cellular functions.<ref name="pmid2312358"/><ref name = "pmid1769989">{{cite journal |author=Mok CC, Lau CS |title=Pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=J.

===Rheumatoid arthritis===

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis can develop anti-dsDNA antibodies, however they are usually treatment related. Anti-TNFα biological therapies, such as [[adalimumab]], [[infliximab]] and [[etanercept]], can often induce the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies. They are usually low avidity and are only detectable transiently after treatment. The presence of these antibodies can induce a lupus-like syndrome in some cases.<ref name="pmid10597335">{{cite journal |author=Hanauer SB |title=Review article: safety of infliximab in clinical trials |journal=Aliment.

===Viral infection===

Infection with viral pathogens can induce anti-dsDNA antibodies transiently. [[Human immunodeficiency virus]], [[parvovirus B19]] and [[BK virus]] are known to induce these antibodies.<ref name="pmid9572708">{{cite journal |author=Hansen KE, Arnason J, Bridges AJ |title=Autoantibodies and common viral illnesses |journal=Semin.

===Other diseases===

There is little evidence supporting the association between anti-dsDNA antibodies and other diseases. Occasionally the monoclonal proteins produced by myeloma patients can be anti-dsDNA. Also, some patients with [[Autoimmune hepatitis|type 1 autoimmune hepatitis]] produce anti-dsDNA antibodies.<ref name ="pmid17500073">{{cite journal |author=Isenberg DA, Manson JJ, Ehrenstein MR, Rahman A |title=Fifty years of anti-ds DNA antibodies: are we approaching journey's end? |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford) |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=1052–6 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17500073 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/kem112 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid18270862">{{cite journal |author=Maya R, Gershwin ME, Shoenfeld Y |title=Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and autoimmune disease |journal=Clin Rev Allergy Immunol |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=85–102 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18270862 |doi=10.1007/s12016-007-8013-6 |url=}}</ref>

==Detection and quantitation==

===Farr assay===
The Farr assay is used to quantify the amount of anti-dsDNA antibodies in [[serum (blood)|serum]]. [[Ammonium sulphate]] is used to precipitate antigen-antibody complexes that form if the sera contains antibodies to dsDNA. The quantity of these antibodies is determined by using radioactively labelled dsDNA. Although this test is very specific, it is of little use in routine diagnostic laboratories due to its laboriousness and use of radioactive materials. The Farr assay is one of the only tests available that detects high avidity antibodies (along with ''Crithidia luciliae'') and also has the ability to detect antibodies of any isotype.<ref name="pmid10911799"/>

===PEG===
The [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) assay precipitates DNA-antibody complexes, similar to the Farr Assay. However, unlike the Farr Assay it does not dissociate the low avidity antibody complexes, allowing for the detection of both high and low avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies.<ref name ="pmid2802796">{{cite journal |author=Nossent JC, Huysen V, Smeenk RJ, Swaak AJ |title=Low avidity antibodies to dsDNA as a diagnostic tool |journal=Ann. Rheum. Dis. |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=748–52 |year=1989 |month=September |pmid=2802796 |pmc=1003868 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Immunofluorescence===

====Animal Tissue====
Animal tissue was the first substrate for immunofluorescent detection of antinuclear antibodies and has been in use since the late 1950s. Liver and kidney tissue sections from animals such as rats are used to identify anti-dsDNA antibodies. This substrate has largely been superseded by the use of HEp-2 cells.<ref name="pmid10629135"/>

====HEp-2====
Hep-2 cells, originally of laryngeal carcinoma origin, are actually a contamination of [[HeLa]] cells.<ref name="pmid17960586">{{cite journal |author=Lacroix M |title=Persistent use of "false" cell lines |journal=Int. J. Cancer |volume=122 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=17960586 |doi=10.1002/ijc.23233 |url=}}</ref> They are routinely used in the diagnosis of ANA in diagnostic laboratories. HEp-2 cells provide a greater ability to differentiate patterns of ANA than animal sections, due to the large nuclei and high mitotic rate of the cell line. Upon incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies and fluorescent labelled secondary antibodies, homogeneous staining of interphase nuclei and condensed chromosomal staining of mitotic cells can be seen.<ref name="isbn0-7044-2437-1">{{cite book |author=Bradwell, A. R. |title=Atlas of HEp-2 patterns and laboratory techniques |publisher=Binding Site |location=Birmingham |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-7044-2437-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

====Crithidia====
''[[Crithidia luciliae]]'' is a haemoflagellate [[protist]] with an organelle known as the [[kinetoplast]]. This organelle contains a high concentration of circular DNA with no recognisable nuclear antigens, allowing for the reliable detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies. The kinetoplast fluoresces if serum contains high avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies. This test has a higher specificity than EIA because it uses unprocessed DNA. Processed DNA can contain regions of ssDNA, allowing detection of anti-ssDNA antibodies, which can give false positive results.<ref name="pmid10629135"/><ref name="pmid786521">{{cite journal |author=Slater NG, Cameron JS, Lessof MH |title=The Crithidia luciliae kinetoplast immunofluorescence test in systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=Clin. Exp. Immunol. |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=480–6 |year=1976 |month=September |pmid=786521 |pmc=1541410 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===EIA===

EIA detects antibodies using a DNA-coated polystyrene microtitre plate. The DNA used in these assays is often [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] dsDNA or from calf thymus extract.<ref name ="isbn1-899066-62-4">{{cite book |author=Burnett, David; Crocker, John R. |title=The Science of Laboratory Diagnosis |publisher=ISIS Medical Media |location= |year=1999 |pages=494–495 |isbn=1-899066-62-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Upon incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies, the antibodies will bind to the DNA and can then be visualised using enzyme-linked secondary antibodies. This assay can be quantitative or semi-quantitative, allowing for estimations of the levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies. This test can produce false positives due to contamination of ssDNA from denatured dsDNA. EIA detects low and high avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies, increasing its sensitivity and reducing its specificity.<ref name="pmid10629135"/>

===Flow cytometry===

[[Flow cytometry]] for the detection of ANA uses [[Multiplex (assay)|multiplexed]] polystyrene beads coated with multiple autoantigens, such as [[Anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies|SSA]], [[Sjogren syndrome antigen B|
SSB]], [[LSm|Sm]],
[[Ribonucleoprotein|RNP]], [[Scl-70]], [[Jo-1]], [[dsDNA]], [[Centromere protein B|centromere B]] and [[histone]]. Serum is incubated with the beads and in the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies, or any other ANA, the antibodies will bind and fluorescent labelled secondary antibodies will be used for detection. The beads are run through a flow cell which uses a laser to detect fluorescence.<ref name="pmid21463992">{{cite journal |author=Yu X, Schneiderhan-Marra N, Joos TO |title=[Protein microarrays and personalized medicine] |language=French |journal=Ann. Biol. Clin. (Paris) |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=17–29 |year=2011 |pmid=21463992 |doi=10.1684/abc.2010.0512 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid17376860">{{cite journal |author=Avaniss-Aghajani E, Berzon S, Sarkissian A |title=Clinical value of multiplexed bead-based immunoassays for detection of autoantibodies to nuclear antigens |journal=Clin.

===Multiplex immunoassay (MIA)===

Similar to the flow cytometry method of ANA detection, the MIA uses wells containg autoantigens and HEp-2 extract coated beads. The bead sets are coated with specific autoantigens and can be detected individually to allow identification of the particular autoantibody. Automated analysis of the well fluorescence allows for rapid detection of autoantibodies.<ref name="pmid21463992"/><ref name ="pmid2628865">{{cite journal |author=Kumar Y, Bhatia A, Minz RW |title=Antinuclear antibodies and their detection methods in diagnosis of connective tissue diseases: a journey revisited |journal=Diagn Pathol |volume=4 |issue= |pages=1 |year=2009 |pmid=19121207 |pmc=2628865 |doi=10.1186/1746-1596-4-1 |url=}}</ref>

===Microarrays===

Microarrays are a newly emerging method for the detection of ANA. Individual autoantigens are painted in an array of dots onto a surface such as polystyrene. A single array could consist of hundreds of autoantigens for screening of multiple autoimmune diseases simultaneously. If anti-dsDNA antibodies are present, incubation of serum and the microarray allow for binding and the dots can then be visualised using a fluorescent labelled anti-IgG antibody.<ref name="pmid12223102">{{cite journal |author=Hueber W, Utz PJ, Steinman L, Robinson WH |title=Autoantibody profiling for the study and treatment of autoimmune disease |journal=Arthritis Res. |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=290–5 |year=2002 |pmid=12223102 |pmc=128938 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
