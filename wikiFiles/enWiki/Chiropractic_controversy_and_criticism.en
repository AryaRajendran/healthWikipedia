[[Image:Daniel David Palmer.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Half-length sitting portrait of man in his fifties with large gray beard and moustache, wearing coat and vest|[[Daniel David Palmer|D.D. Palmer]]]]
The birth of chiropractic was on September 18, 1895. There is controversy over what happened with several different accounts. Daniel D. Palmer later claimed that on that day he manipulated the spine of [[William Harvey Lillard|Harvey Lillard]], a man who was nearly deaf, allegedly curing him of deafness. Palmer said ''"there was nothing accidental about this, as it was accomplished with an object in view, and the expected result was obtained. There was nothing 'crude' about this adjustment; it was specific so much so that no chiropractor has equaled it."''<ref>[http://collections.ic.gc.ca/heirloom_series/volume5/130-133.htm Daniel David Palmer short history]</ref>

However, this version was disputed by Lillard's daughter, Valdeenia Lillard Simons. She said that her father told her that he was telling jokes to a friend in the hall outside Palmer's office and Palmer, who had been reading, joined them. When Lillard reached the punch line, Palmer, laughing heartily, slapped Lillard on the back with the hand holding the heavy book he had been reading. A few days later, Lillard told Palmer that his hearing seemed better. Palmer then decided to explore manipulation as an expansion of his magnetic healing practice. Simons said "the compact was that if they can make [something of] it, then they both would share. But, it didn't happen."<ref name="Westbrooks">{{cite journal |author= Westbrooks B |year=1982 |title= The troubled legacy of Harvey Lillard: the black experience in chiropractic |journal= Chiropr Hist |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=47–53 |pmid=11611211}}</ref>

In spite of the fact that Lillard could hear well enough to tell jokes, [[B.J. Palmer]] claimed under sworn testimony that Lillard had been "thoroughly deaf".<ref name=BJPalmerTestimony>[http://www.chirobase.org/05RB/BCC/07.html B.J. Palmer's testimony in State of Wisconsin vs. S. R. Jansheski, December, 1910]</ref> Since 1895, the story of Palmer's curing a man of deafness has been a part of chiropractic tradition. Palmer's account differs significantly from what actually happened, in that, according to Lillard's daughter, his improved hearing was likely caused by an accidentally fortuitous jarring of Lillard's body and not, as claimed by D.D. Palmer, caused by a "specific" adjustment. It was after this event that Palmer began to experiment with manipulation. He also claimed that his second patient, a man with heart disease, was also cured by spinal manipulation.

He defined chiropractic as "a science of healing without drugs" and considered establishing chiropractic as a [[religion]].<!-- <ref name=Ernst-eval/> --> Chiropractic included vitalistic ideas of [[Innate Intelligence]] with religious attributes of [[Universal Intelligence]] to substitute science.<ref name=Ernst-eval/> Evidence suggests that D.D. Palmer had acquired knowledge of manipulative techniques from [[Andrew Taylor Still]], the founder of [[osteopathy]].<ref name=Ernst-eval/> Although D.D. Palmer combined [[bonesetting]] to give chiropractic its method, and "[[magnetic healing]]" for the theory, he acknowledged a special relation to magnetic healing when he wrote, "chiropractic was not evolved from medicine or any other method, except that of magnetic."<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/> According to D.D. Palmer, subluxation was the sole cause of disease and manipulation was the cure for all diseases of the human race.<ref name=Ernst-eval>{{cite journal |pmid=18280103 |year=2008 |month=May |last1=Ernst |first1=E |title=Chiropractic: a critical evaluation |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=544–62 |issn=0885-3924 |doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.07.004 |journal=Journal of pain and symptom management}}</ref>

Chiropractic has had a strong salesmanship element since it was started by D.D. Palmer. His son, [[B.J. Palmer]], asserted that their chiropractic school was founded on "…a business, not a professional basis. We manufacture chiropractors. We teach them the idea and then we show them how to sell it".<ref name=pmid18670469>{{cite journal |pmid=18670469 |url=http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/121-1278/3158/ |year=2008 |month=Jul |last1=Colquhoun |first1=D |title=Doctor Who? Inappropriate use of titles by some alternative "medicine" practitioners |volume=121 |issue=1278 |pages=6–10 |issn=0028-8446 |journal=The New Zealand medical journal}}</ref> D.D. Palmer established a magnetic healing facility in Davenport, Iowa, styling himself ‘doctor’. Not everyone was convinced, as a local paper in 1894 wrote about him: "A crank on magnetism has a crazy notion hat he can cure the sick and crippled with his magnetic hands. His victims are the weak-minded, ignorant and superstitious, those foolish people who have been sick for years and have become tired of the regular physician and want health by the short-cut method…he has certainly profited by the ignorance of his victims…His increase in business shows what can be done in Davenport, even by a quack."<ref name=pmid18670469/> D.D. Palmer remarked that "Give me a simple mind that thinks along single tracts, give me 30 days to instruct him, and that individual can go forth on the highways and byways and get more sick people well than the best, most complete, all around, unlimited medical education of any medical man who ever lived."<ref name=Ernst-eval/>

Chiropractic has seen considerable controversy within the profession over its philosophy.<ref>{{cite book |first=Wayne B. |last=Jonas |chapter=Foreword – Chiropractic: the return of philosophy to medicine? |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=zsY8dwHl54YC&pg=PR9 |pages=ix–xii |editor=Ian D.

Chiropractic was rooted in [[Mysticism|mystical concepts]], leading to internal conflicts between straights and mixers which continue to this day.<ref name=Ernst-eval/> It has two main groups: "straights", now the minority, emphasize [[vitalism]], innate intelligence and [[spinal adjustment]]s, and consider subluxations to be the leading cause of all disease; "mixers" are more open to mainstream and alternative medical techniques such as exercise, massage, nutritional supplements, and [[acupuncture]].<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg>{{cite journal |pmid=9818801 |year=1998 |month=Nov |last1=Kaptchuk |first1=TJ |last2=Eisenberg |title=Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions |volume=158 |issue=20 |pages=2215–24 |issn=0003-9926 |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9818801 |doi=10.1001/archinte.158.20.2215 |first2=DM}}</ref> The straights adhere religiously to the gospel of its founders while mixers are more open.<ref name=Ernst-eval/> There is a lack of uniformity and consensus among chiropractors in regard to their role.

California chiropractors adopted the motto, "Go to jail for chiropractic." 450 chiropractors were jailed in a single year at the peak of the controversy. Many chiropractors treated fellow prisoners and visiting patients while in jail.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/>

For much of the history of the chiropractic profession chiropractors showed little interest in scientific research and regarded their principles and practices as valid.<ref name=Nelson/> Despite heavy opposition by mainstream medicine, by the 1930s chiropractic was the largest alternative healing profession in the U.S.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11623404 |year=1993 |month=Oct |last1=Martin |first1=SC |title=Chiropractic and the social context of medical technology, 1895-1925 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=808–34 |issn=0040-165X |journal=Technology and culture |doi=10.2307/3106416 |jstor=3106416}}</ref> The lack of acceptance with mainstream public health was contributed to by the long standing American Medical Association (AMA) policies against chiropractic.<ref name=Chiro-PH/> The AMA created the Committee on Quackery "to contain and eliminate chiropractic."

Chiropractic constitutes a hazard to rational health care in the United States because of its substandard and unscientific education of its practitioners and their rigid adherence to an irrational, unscientific approach to disease causation."<ref name=Chiro-PH/> The longstanding feud between chiropractors and [[medical doctor]]s continued for decades.

A study of California disciplinary statistics during 1997–2000 reported 4.5 disciplinary actions per 1000 chiropractors per year, compared to 2.27 for medical Doctors, and the incident rate for fraud was 9 times greater among chiropractors (1.99 per 1000 chiropractors per year) than among medical Doctors (0.20).<ref name=Foreman>{{cite journal |pmid=15389179 |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2004.06.006 |year=2004 |month=Sep |last1=Foreman |first1=SM |last2=Stahl |title=Chiropractors disciplined by a state chiropractic board and a comparison with disciplined medical physicians |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=472–7 |issn=0161-4754 |journal=Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics |first2=MJ}}</ref> According to a 2006 Gallup Poll of U.S. adults, when asked how they would "rate the honesty and ethical standards of people in these different fields", chiropractic compared unfavorably with mainstream medicine.

Historically the profession has often been accused of [[quackery]], with the profession often responding negatively to such accusations. In its early days, the accusation of quackery was voiced in a 1913 editorial in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'':

: "Chiropractic is a freak offshoot from osteopathy. Disease, say the chiropractors, is due to pressure on the spinal nerves; ergo it can be cured by "adjusting" the spinal column. It is the sheerest quackery, and those who profess to teach it make their appeal to the cupidity of the ignorant. Its practice is in no sense a profession but a trade - and a trade that is potent for great harm. It is carried on almost exclusively by those of no education, ignorant of anatomy, ignorant even of the fundamental sciences on which the treatment of disease depends." (p. 29)<ref name=Smith-Cunnien>Susan L. Smith-Cunnien.
[http://books.google.com/books?id=pDobc-oGPbIC A profession of one's own: organized medicine's opposition to chiropractic]</ref>

The view that chiropractic was a trade, rather than a profession, was stated clearly by [[B.J. Palmer]], who asserted that chiropractic was founded on "…a business, not a professional basis. We manufacture chiropractors. We teach them the idea and then we show them how to sell it".<ref name=pmid18670469/>

In more modern times (1991), when the president of the ACA called accusations of quackery a "myth", chiropractic historian, [[Joseph C. Keating, Jr.]] responded by calling his comments "absurd" and stated:

: "The so-called 'quackery myth about chiropractic' is no myth.....the kernels of quackery (i.e., unsubstantiated and untested health remedies offered as "proven") are ubiquitous in this profession. I dare say that health misinformation (if not quackery) can be found in just about any issue of any chiropractic trade publication (and some of our research journals) and much of the promotional materials chiropractors disseminate to patients. The recent unsubstantiated claims of the ACA are exemplary ''[examples provided]''...It escapes me entirely how Dr. Downing, the ACA, MPI, and Dynamic Chiropractic can suggest that there is no quackery in chiropractic. Either these groups and individuals do not read the chiropractic literature or have no crap-detectors.

In an article on quackery, W.T. Jarvis has stated that "Non-scientific health care (e.g., acupuncture, ayurvedic medicine, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy) is licensed by individual states.

William T. Jarvis, Ph.D. has stated: "Chiropractic is a controversial health-care system that has been legalized throughout the United States and in several other countries. In the United States in 1984, roughly 10.7 million people made 163 million office visits to 30,000 chiropractors. More than three fourths of the states require insurance companies to include chiropractic services in health and accident policies. The federal government pays for limited chiropractic services under Medicare, Medicaid, and its vocational rehabilitation program, and the Internal Revenue Service allows a medical deduction for chiropractic services. Chiropractors cite such facts as evidence of "recognition." However, these are merely business statistics and legal arrangements that have nothing to do with chiropractic's scientific validity."<ref name=Jarvis>William T.

== Ownership of manipulation ==

No single profession "owns" spinal manipulation and there is little consensus as to which profession should administer SM, raising concerns by chiropractors that orthodox medical physicians could "steal" SM procedures from chiropractors. A focus on evidence-based SM research has also raised concerns that the resulting practice guidelines could limit the scope of chiropractic practice to treating backs and necks.<ref name=Villanueva-Russell>{{cite journal |journal= [[Soc Sci Med]] |year=2005 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=545–61 |title= Evidence-based medicine and its implications for the profession of chiropractic |author= Villanueva-Russell Y |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.05.017 |pmid=15550303}}</ref> Two U.S. states (Washington and Arkansas) prohibit physical therapists from performing SM,<ref>{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Chantal |title=Physical therapists, chiropractors square off over bill |url=http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/politicsnorthwest/2009/01/22/the_campus_is_heating_up.html |date=2009-01-22 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref> some states allow them to do it only if they have completed advanced training in SM, and some states allow only chiropractors to perform SM, or only chiropractors and physicians.
