A '''panoramic radiograph''' (also termed panorex<sup>TM</sup>, dental panoramic radiograph, orthopantomogram or orthopantomograph<sup>TM</sup>, and sometimes abbreviated as PAN, DPR, OPT or OPG), is a [[panorama|panoramic]] scanning [[dental radiography|dental X-ray]] of the upper and lower [[jaw]]. It shows a [[two-dimensional]] view of a [[semi-circle|half-circle]] from [[ear]] to ear. An OPG relies on [[tomography]] i.e. images of specific radiographic planes are taken to make up the larger panoramic image where the [[maxilla]] and [[mandible]] are in the focal trough and the structures, superficial and deep to the trough, are blurred.

==Types==
Dental [[panoramic]] [[radiography]] equipment consists of a horizontal rotating arm which holds an X-ray source and a moving [[film]] mechanism (carrying a film) arranged at opposed extremities. The patient's [[Human skull|skull]] sits between the X-ray generator and the film. The [[X-ray]] source is [[collimated]] toward the film, to give a [[light beam|beam]] shaped as a vertical [[blade]] having a width of 4-7mm {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} when arriving on the film, after crossing the patient's skull. Also the height of that beam covers the [[Human mandible|mandible]]s and the [[maxilla]] regions. The arm moves and its movement may be described as a rotation around an instant center which shifts on a dedicated [[trajectory]].

The manufacturers propose different solutions for moving the arm, trying to maintain constant distance between the teeth to the film and generator. Also those moving solutions try to project the teeth [[arch]] as [[orthogonal]]ly as possible. It is impossible to select an ideal movement as the anatomy varies very much from person to person. Finally a [[compromise]] is selected by each manufacturer and results in [[magnification]] factors which vary strongly along the film (15%-30%). The patient positioning is very critical in regard to both sharpness and distortions.

===Films===
There are two kinds of film moving mechanisms, one using a sliding flat [[wikt:cassette|cassette]] which holds the film, and another using a rotating cylinder around which the film is wound. There are two standard sizes for dental panoramic films: 30&nbsp;cm x12cm (12"x 5") and 30&nbsp;cm x 15&nbsp;cm (12"x6"). The smaller size film receives 8% less X-ray [[dosimetry|dosage]] on it compared to the bigger size.

===Digital===
Dental X-rays' radiology is moving from film technology (involving a chemical developing process) to '''[[digital X-ray]]''' technology, which is based on electronic sensors and [[computer]]s. One of the principal advantages compared to film based systems is the much greater [[exposure latitude]]. This means many fewer repeated scans, which reduces costs and also reduces patient exposure to [[radiation]]. Lost X-rays can also be reprinted if the digital file is saved. Other significant advantages include instantly viewable images, the ability to enhance images, the ability to email images to practitioners and clients (without needing to digitize them first), easy and reliable document handling, reduced X-ray exposure, that no [[darkroom]] is required, and that no [[chemical]]s are used.

One particular type of digital system uses a [[photostimulable phosphor plate]] (aka PSP - Phosphor Plate) in place of the film. After X-ray exposure the plate (sheet) is placed in a special [[image scanner|scanner]] where the [[latency (engineering)|latent]] formed image is retrieved point by point and [[digitized]], using a laser light scanning. The digitized images are stored and displayed on the computer screen. This method is in between old film based technology and the current direct digital imaging technology. It is similar to the film process because it involves the same image support handling and differs because the chemical development process is replaced by the scanning process. This is not much faster that film processing and the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and sensitivity performances are contested. However it has the clear advantage of being able to fit with any existing equipment without any modification because it replaces just the existing film.

Also sometimes the term "digital X-rays" is used to designate the scanned film documents which further are handled by computers.

The other types of digital imaging technologies use electronic sensors. A majority of them first convert the X-rays in light (using a GdO2S or [[Caesium iodide|CsI]] layer) which is further captured using a [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] or a [[CMOS]] image sensor. Few of them use a hybrid [[analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital]] arrangement which first converts the X-ray into [[electricity]] (using a [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]] layer) and then this electricity is rendered as an image by a reading section based on CMOS technology.

In current state-of-the-art digital systems, the image quality is vastly superior to conventional film-based systems. The latest advancements have also seen the addition on Cone Beam 3D Technology to standard digital panoramic devices.

==Indications==

OPGs are used by health care professionals to provide information on:

* [[Wisdom teeth#Impaction|Impacted wisdom teeth]] diagnosis and treatment planning - the most common use is to determine the status of wisdom teeth and trauma to the jaws.
* [[Periodontal]] [[bone]] loss and periapical involvement.
* Finding the source of dental [[pain]]
* Assessment for the placement of dental [[implant (medicine)|implant]]s
* [[Orthodontic]] assessment. pre and post operative
* Caries detection especially in the inter-dental region.
* Diagnosis of developmental anomalies such as [[cherubism]], [[cleido cranial dysplasia]]
* [[Carcinoma]] in relation to the jaws
* [[Temporomandibular joint dysfunction]]s and [[Tempero manidbular ankylosis|ankylosis]].
* Diagnosis of [[osteosarcoma]], [[ameloblastoma]], renal [[osteodystrophy]] affecting jaws and hypophosphatemia.
* Diagnosis, and pre- and post-surgical assessment of [[dental trauma|oral]] and [[maxillofacial trauma]], e.g. dentoalveolar fractures and [[mandibular fracture]]s.

==Mechanism==
Normally, the person bites on a plastic [[spatula]] so that all the teeth, especially the [[crown (tooth)|crowns]], can be viewed individually. The whole orthopantomogram process takes about one [[minute]]. The patient's actual radiation exposure time varies between 5.5 and 22 seconds for the machine’s excursion around the skull.

The [[collimation]] of the machine means that, while rotating, the X-rays project only a limited portion of the [[anatomy]] onto the film at any given instant but, as the rotation progresses around the skull, a composite picture of the maxillo-facial block is created. While the arm rotates, the film moves in a such way that the projected partial skull image (limited by the beam section) scrolls over it and exposes it entirely. Not all of the overlapping individual images projected on the film have the same magnification because the beam is [[beam divergence|divergent]] and the images have differing focus points. Also not all the element images move with the same [[velocity]] on the target film as some of them are more distant from and others closer to the instant rotation center. The velocity of the film is controlled in such fashion to fit exactly the velocity of projection of the anatomical elements of the dental arch side which is closest to the film. Therefore they are recorded sharply while the elements in different places are recorded blurred as they scroll at different velocity.

The dental panoramic image suffers from important distortions because a vertical [[zoom lens|zoom]] and a horizontal zoom both vary differently along the image. The vertical and horizontal zooms are determined by the relative position of the recorded element versus film and generator. Features closer to the generator receive more vertical zoom. The horizontal zoom is also dependent on the relative position of the element to the focal path. Features inside the focal path arch receive more horizontal zoom and are blurred; features outside receive less horizontal zoom and are blurred.

The result is an image showing sharply the section along the mandible arch, and blurred elsewhere. For example, the more radio-opaque anatomical region, the cervical vertebrae (neck), shows as a wide and blurred vertical pillar overlapping the front teeth. The path where the anatomical elements are recorded sharply is called "focal path".

===Principal advantage of panoramic images===
* Broad coverage of facial bones and teeth
* Low patient radiation dose
* Convenience of examination for the patient (films need not be placed inside the mouth)
* Ability to be used in patients who cannot open the mouth or when the opening is restricted e.g.: due to [[trismus]]
* Short time require for making the image
* Patient's ready understandability of panaromic films, making them a useful visual aid in patient education and case presentation.
* Easy to store compared to the large set of intra oral x-rays which are typically used.<ref>Stuart C. White, Micheal J Pharoh, Oral Radiology and Interpretation Mosby 2005</ref>

==Preparation==
Persons who are to undergo panoramic radiography usually are required to remove any earrings, jewellery, hair pins, glasses, [[denture]]s or [[orthodontic appliance]]s.<ref name="Whaites 2007">{{cite book|first=Whaites E; foreword by Cawson RA|title=Essentials of dental radiography and radiology|year=2007|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-443-10168-7|pages=187-206|edition=4th ed.}}</ref> If these articles are not removed, they may create artifacts on the image (especially if they contain metal) and reduce its usefulness. There is also a need for the person to stay absolutely still during the 18 or so second cycle it takes for the machine to expose the film. For this reason, radiographers often explain to the person beforehand how the machine will move.<ref name="Whaites 2007" />  

==Adverse effects==
Like any medical imaging utilizing [[ionizing radiation]], there will be a degree of direct ionizing damage and indirect damage from [[free radical]]s created during the ionization of water molecules within cells. A rough estimate of the risk of fatal cancer from a panoramic radiograph is about 1 in 1,000,000.<ref name="Whaites 2007" /> The age of the person being imaged also alters the risk, with younger people having a slightly higher risk. E.g. the 1 in 1,000,000 risk would be doubled for someone in the 10-20 age group.<ref name="Whaites 2007" />

==History==
===Historical milestones for Digital Panoramic Systems===
1985-1991 - The first dental digital panoramic systems were designed by McDavid et al. at [[The Dental School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio|UTHSCSA]].<ref>http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5018177.html</ref><br/>
1995 - DXIS, the first dental digital panoramic X-rays system available on the market, was introduced by Signet (France). DXIS was targeted to retrofit all the panoramic models.<br/>
1997 - SIDEXIS, of [[Siemens]] (currently [http://www.sirona.com Sirona Dental Systems], Germany) offered a digital option for Ortophos Plus panoramic unit, DigiPan of Trophy [http://dmd.co.il/EN3.php] Radiology (France) offered a digital option  for the OP100 panoramic made by Instrumentarium (Finland).<br/>
1998-2004 - many panoramic manufacturers offered their own digital systems.
2006 - SCAN300FP, of '[http://www.ajat.fi Ajat]' (Finland) is the latest innovation offered. It shows the feature to acquire many hundreds of mega bytes of image information at high frame rate and to reconstruct the panoramic layer by post acquisition computing. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Panoramic radiographs have the capability to demonstrate a portion of the neck and display atheromas (calcifications in the [[carotid artery]]) which are an indication of both local and generalized (systemic) [[atherosclerosis]]. Atherosclerosis of the [[coronary arteries]] leading to [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), and atherosclerosis of the carotid artery leading to [[stroke]] are the number one and number three most common causes of death in the United States.<ref name="ref3">American Heart Association‚Äôs Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics‚Äî2010 Update [http://www.americanheart.org/downloadable/heart/1265665152970DS-3241%20HeartStrokeUpdate_2010.pdf]</ref>

There is interest to look at panoramic radiographs as a screening tool, however further data is needed with regards if it is able to make a meaningful difference in outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roldán-Chicano|first=R|coauthors=Oñate-Sánchez, RE; López-Castaño, F; Cabrerizo-Merino, MC; Martínez-López, F|title=Panoramic radiograph as a method for detecting calcified atheroma plaques.

=== Dental Infection and Atherosclerosis ===

Atherosclerosis is attributed to risk factors that include cigarette smoking, [[hyperlipidemia]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes mellitus]], and [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure). These factors, however, do not fully account for the risk of disease. Atherosclerosis has been conceptualized as a chronic inflammatory response to [[endothelial cell]] injury<ref name="ref20">{{cite journal |last1=Epstein |first1=Franklin H. |last2=Ross |first2=Russell |title=Atherosclerosis — an Inflammatory Disease |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=340 |issue=2 |pages=115–26 |year=1999 |pmid=9887164 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199901143400207}}</ref> and dysfunction possibly arising from chronic dental infection. In 2010, using the previously validated Mattila panoramic radiographic index to quantify the totality of dental infection (i.e., periapical and [[furcation defect|furcal lesions]], [[pericoronitis]] sites, [[dental caries|carious]] tooth roots, teeth with [[pulp (tooth)|pulpal]] caries, and vertical bony defects), Friedlander’s group determined that individuals with carotid artery atheromas on their panoramic radiographs had significantly greater amounts of dental infection/inflammation than atherogenic risk-matched controls devoid of radiographic atheromas.<ref name="ref21">{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.298.6676.779 |last1=Mattila |first1=KJ |last2=Nieminen |first2=MS |last3=Valtonen |first3=VV |last4=Rasi |first4=VP |last5=Kes�niemi |first5=YA |last6=Syrj�l� |first6=SL |last7=Jungell |first7=PS |last8=Isoluoma |first8=M |last9=Hietaniemi |first9=K |title=Association between dental health and acute myocardial infarction |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |volume=298 |issue=6676 |pages=779–81 |year=1989 |pmid=2496855 |pmc=1836063}}</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=April 2013}}<ref name="ref22">{{cite journal |last1=Friedlander |first1=AH |last2=Sung |first2=EC |last3=Chung |first3=EM |last4=Garrett |first4=NR |title=Radiographic quantification of chronic dental infection and its relationship to the atherosclerotic process in the carotid arteries |journal=Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology, oral radiology, and endodontics |volume=109 |issue=4 |pages=615–21 |year=2010 |pmid=20097109 |doi=10.1016/j.tripleo.2009.10.036}}</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=April 2013}} While the Mattila index had been previously used to relate the extent of dental infection to [[coronary artery disease]], this research is the first to link the full range of dental disease that it measures to panoramic radiographs evidencing calcified carotid artery atherosclerosis.
