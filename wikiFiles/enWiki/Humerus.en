The '''humerus''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|h|y|uː|m|ər|ə|s}}; ME from Latin ''humerus, umerus'' upper arm, shoulder; cf. Gothic ''ams'' shoulder, Greek ''ōmos''. Plural: ''humeri'') is a [[long bone]] in the [[arm]] or [[forelimb]] that runs from the [[shoulder]] to the [[elbow]].

Anatomically, in modern humans, it connects the [[scapula]] and the lower arm (consisting of the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]]), and consists of three sections. The [[upper extremity of humerus|upper extremity]] consists of a rounded head, a narrow neck, and two short processes (tubercles, sometimes called tuberosities.) Its [[body of humerus|body]] is cylindrical in its upper portion, and more [[prism (geometry)|prism]]atic below. The [[lower extremity of humerus|lower extremity]] consists of 2 [[epicondyle]]s, 2 processes ([[trochlea of the humerus|trochlea]] & [[capitulum of the humerus|capitulum]]), and 3 fossae ([[radial fossa]], [[coronoid fossa]], and [[olecranon fossa]]). As well as its true anatomical neck, the constriction below the greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus is referred to as its [[Surgical neck of the humerus|surgical neck]] due to its tendency to commonly get fractured, thus often becoming the focus of surgeons.

== Muscles attached to the humerus ==
The [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]] originates on the lateral third of the [[clavicle]], [[acromion]] and the crest of the [[spine of scapula|spine]] of the scapula. It is inserted on the [[deltoid tuberosity]] of the humerus and has several actions including abduction, extension, and circumduction of the shoulder. The [[supraspinatus]] also originates on the spine of the scapula. It inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus, and assists in abduction of the shoulder.

The [[pectoralis major]], [[teres major]], and [[latissimus dorsi]] insert at the ''intertubercular groove'' of the humerus. They work to adduct and medially, or internally, rotate the humerus.

The [[infraspinatus]] and [[teres minor]] insert on the greater tubercle, and work to laterally, or externally, rotate the humerus. In contrast, the [[subscapularis]] muscle inserts onto the lesser tubercle and works to medially, or internally, rotate the humerus.

The [[biceps brachii]], [[brachialis]], and [[brachioradialis]] (which attaches distally) act to flex the elbow. (The biceps, however, does not attach to the humerus.) The [[triceps brachii]] and [[anconeus]] extend the elbow, and attach to the posterior side of the humerus.

The four muscles of supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis form a musculo-ligamentous girdle called the [[rotator cuff]]. This cuff stabilizes the very mobile but inherently unstable [[glenohumeral joint]]. The other muscles are used as counterbalances for the actions of lifting/pulling and pressing/pushing.

== Articulations ==
At the shoulder, the head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid fossa of the [[scapula]]. More distally, at the elbow, the capitulum of the humerus articulates with the head of the [[radius (bone)|radius]], and the trochlea of the humerus articulates with the trochlear notch of the [[ulna]].

== Nerves ==
The [[axillary nerve]] is located at the proximal end, against the shoulder girdle. Dislocation of the humerus's [[glenohumeral joint]], has the potential to injure the axillary nerve or the [[axillary artery]]. Signs and symptoms of this dislocation include a loss of the normal shoulder contour and a palpable depression under the acromion.

The [[radial nerve]] follows the humerus closely. At the midshaft of the humerus, the radial nerve travels from the posterior to the anterior aspect of the bone in the ''spiral groove''. A fracture of the humerus in this region can result in radial nerve injury.

The [[ulnar nerve]] at the distal end of the humerus near the elbow is sometimes referred to in popular culture as 'the funny bone'. Striking this nerve can cause a tingling sensation ("funny" feeling), and sometimes a significant amount of pain. It lies posterior to the medial epicondyle, and is easily damaged in elbow injuries.<ref>http://teachmeanatomy.net/upper-limb-2/bones/the-humerus/</ref>

==In other animals==
Primitive fossil [[amphibian]]s had little, if any, shaft connecting the upper and lower extremities, making their limbs very short. In most living vertebrates, however, the humerus has a similar form to that of humans. In many [[reptile]]s and some primitive [[mammal]]s, the lower extremity includes a large foramen, or opening, into which nerves and blood vessels pass.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 198–199|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>
