The condition can cause a variety of symptoms: physical, such as [[headache]]; cognitive, such as difficulty concentrating; and emotional and behavioral, such as [[irritability]].  As many of the symptoms in PCS are common to, or exacerbated by, other disorders, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. Though there is no treatment for PCS itself, symptoms can be treated; medications and physical and [[behaviour therapy|behavioral therapy]] may be used, and patients can be educated about symptoms and their usual prognosis.  The majority of PCS cases disappear after a period of time.

It is not known what causes PCS symptoms to occur and persist,<ref name="Iverson GL and Lange RT">

</ref>  The nature of the syndrome and the diagnosis itself have been the subject of intense debate since the 19th century. However, certain risk factors have been identified; for example, preexisting medical or psychological conditions, expectations of disability, and older age all increase the chances that someone will suffer PPCS.  Physiological and psychological factors present before, during, and after the injury are all thought to be involved in the development of PCS.<ref name="Ryan03"/>

</ref>  Signs and symptoms such as noise sensitivity, problems with concentration and memory, irritability, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and poor judgment may be called 'late symptoms' because they generally do not occur immediately after the injury, but rather days or weeks after.<ref name="Ryan03"/>  [[Nausea]] and [[drowsiness]] commonly occur two to four weeks after concussion and can be long lasting. Also, headache and [[dizziness]] occur immediately after the injury and can be long lasting.<ref name="Ryan03"/>

===Physical===
The main PCS symptom is [[headache]].<ref name="Hall05"/>  While most people have headaches of the same [[Headache#Types|type]] they experienced before the injury, people with PCS often report more frequent or longer-lasting headaches.<ref name="Hall05"/> Between 30 and 90% of people treated for PCS report having more headaches than they did before the injury, and between 8 and 32% still report them a year after the injury.<ref name="Hall05"/>

[[Dizziness]], the second most common symptom, occurs in about half of people with PCS and is still present in up to a quarter of them a year after the injury.<ref name="Hall05"/>  Older people are at especially high risk for dizziness.<ref name="Hall05"/>

About 10% of people with PCS develop [[photophobia|sensitivity to light]] or [[phonophobia|noise]], about 5% experience a decreased sense of taste or smell, and about 14% have blurred vision.<ref name="Hall05"/> People may also have [[Diplopia|double vision]] or ringing in the ears, also called [[tinnitus]].<ref name="BarthRuff06">

==Causes==
The question of the cause or causes of PCS and PPCS has been heavily debated for many years.  It is not known to exactly what degree the symptoms are due to organic factors, such as microscopic damage to the brain, and to other factors, such as psychological ones.<ref name="merck">Merck manuals online medical library.  2003. [http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec06/ch087/ch087c.html Concussion]. Accessed May 11, 2008.</ref>  The subjectivity of the complaints complicates assessment and makes it difficult to determine whether symptoms are being exaggerated or feigned.<ref name="Hall05"/>

It is possible that some post-concussion symptoms are due to physical causes while others are psychological.<ref name="Ryan03"/> One hypothesis holds that physiological factors are responsible for early symptoms that occur after mild head trauma, whereas symptoms that occur later are due to psychological factors.<ref name="Yeates05"/>

While the cause of symptoms occurring shortly after head trauma is likely to be physiological, it is less clear whether PPCS has an organic basis,<ref name="Dorsten"/><ref name="Jacobson95">

===Physiological===
[[File:EEG mit 32 Electroden.jpg|thumb|right|[[Electroencephalography]], one of the methods used to test brain function after concussion]]

Studies using [[positron emission tomography]] have linked PCS to a reduction in [[glucose]] use by the brain, and changes in [[cerebral blood flow]] have been found to exist for as long as three&nbsp;years after a concussion in studies using [[single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT).<ref name="Hall05"/> At least one study with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has shown differences in brain function during tasks involving memory after MTBI,<ref name="Jorge05">

</ref> and fMRI has shown changes in the brains of athletes within a week of a concussion.<ref name="Iverson2005"/> Not all people with PPCS have abnormalities on imaging, however, and abnormalities found in studies such as fMRI, PET, and SPECT could result from other [[comorbidity|comorbid]] conditions such as [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[chronic pain]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).<ref name="Iverson2005"/> [[Electroencephalogram]]s, while usually normal in people with PCS, have occasionally been used to detect changes in brain function following mild head injury.<ref name="Hall05"/> [[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological]] measures of brain function of people with PPCS show abnormal [[evoked potential]]s and [[event-related potential]]s compared to controls, supporting the hypothesis that PPCS has an organic basis.<ref name="Ryan03"/>

Proponents of the view that PCS has a physical or organic basis point to findings that people with post-concussive symptoms have deficits on standardized tests of cognitive function as an indication that brain dysfunction is a factor in PCS.<ref name="Yeates05"/> Studies have shown that people with PPCS score lower than [[scientific control|control]]s on neuropsychological tests that measure attention, verbal learning, reasoning, and [[information processing]].<ref name="Ryan03"/> But although decreased scores on cognitive tests point to brain dysfunction, they cannot diagnose brain damage.<ref name="Margulies00"/> Recovery as measured by scores on cognitive tests frequently do not [[correlation|correlate]] with resolution of symptoms; people may still report subjective symptoms after their cognitive function has returned to normal.<ref name="Jacobson95"/> Another study found that although children with PPCS had poorer scores on tests of cognitive functioning after the injury, they also had poorer behavioral adjustment before the injury than children with no persistent symptoms; these findings support the idea that PCS may result from a combination of factors such as brain dysfunction resulting from head injury and preexisting psychological or social problems.<ref name="Yeates05"/> Different symptoms may be predicted by different factors; for example, one study found that cognitive and physical symptoms were not predicted by the manner in which parents and family members coped with the injury and adjusted to its effects, but psychological and behavioral symptoms were.<ref name="Yeates05"/>

===Psychological===
It has been convincingly shown that psychological factors play an important role in the presence of post-concussion symptoms.<ref name="Bryant08">

</ref>  The development of PCS may be due to a combination of factors such as adjustment to effects of the injury, preexisting vulnerabilities, and brain dysfunction.<ref name="LeeLK07"/>  Setbacks related to the injury, for example problems at work or with physical or social functioning, may act as stressors that interact with preexisting factors such as personality and mental conditions to cause and perpetuate PPCS.<ref name="Iverson2005"/> In one study, levels of daily stress were found to be correlated to PCS symptoms in both mildly brain injured subjects and controls, but in another, stress was not significantly related to symptoms.<ref name="Ryan03"/>  [[Iatrogenic]] effects (those caused by the medical intervention) may also occur, for example when people focus and dwell on the idea that their brains may be damaged,<ref name="Iverson2005"/> or when they are led to expect symptoms to occur.  Expectation of symptoms may also lead head-injured people to focus on symptoms and therefore perceive them to be more intense, to attribute symptoms that occur for other reasons to the injury, and to underestimate the rate of symptoms before the injury.<ref name="Jacobson95"/>

===Differential diagnosis===

PCS, which shares symptoms with a variety of other conditions, is highly likely to be misdiagnosed in people with these conditions.<ref name="IversonZasler06"/>  Cognitive and affective symptoms that occur following a traumatic injury may be attributed to MTBI, but in fact be due to another factor such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]],<ref name="Bryant08"/> which is easily misdiagnosed as PCS and vice versa.<ref name="IversonZasler06"/>  [[Affective disorders]] such as depression have some symptoms that can mimic those of PCS and lead to a wrongful diagnosis of the latter; these include problems with concentration, [[emotional lability]], anxiety, and sleep problems.<ref name="Hall05"/> Depression, which is highly common in persistent PCS, can worsen other PCS symptoms, such as headaches and problems with concentration, memory, and sleep.<ref name="Rees03">

Therapy aims to aid in the gradual return to work and other preinjury activities, as symptoms permit.  A protocol for PCS treatment has been designed based on the principles behind [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), a psychotherapy aimed at influencing disturbed emotions by improving  thoughts and behaviors.<ref name="Iverson2005"/>   CBT may help prevent persistence of [[iatrogenic]] symptoms<ref name="McAllister02"/>&nbsp;– those that occur because health care providers create the expectation that they will.  A risk exists that the "[[power of suggestion]]" may worsen symptoms and cause long-term disabilities;<ref name="Gualtieri"/> therefore, when counseling is indicated, the therapist must take a psychological origin of symptoms into account and not assume that all symptoms are a direct result of neurological damage from the injury.<ref name="AlexanderMP95"/>

===Education===
Education about symptoms and their usual time course is a part of psychological therapy, and is most effective when provided soon after the injury.<ref name="McAllister02"/> Since [[emotional stress|stress]] exacerbates post-concussion symptoms, and vice versa, an important part of treatment is reassurance that PCS symptoms are normal, and education about how to deal with impairments.<ref name="King"/> One study found that PCS patients who were coached to return to activities gradually, told what symptoms to expect, and trained how to manage them had a reduction in symptoms compared to a control group of uninjured people.<ref name="Weight">

==Epidemiology==
It is not known exactly how common PCS is.  Estimates of the [[prevalence]] at 3&nbsp;months post-injury are between 24 and 84%, a variation possibly caused by different populations or study methodologies.<ref name="Ryan03"/> The estimated [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of PPCS is around 10% of MTBI cases.<ref name="Dorsten"/>  Since PCS by definition only exists in people who have suffered a head injury, demographics and risk factors are similar to those for head injury; for example, young adults are at higher risk than others for receiving head injury, and, consequently, of developing PCS.<ref name="Legome"/>

The existence of PCS in children is controversial.

</ref> [[John Erichsen]], a surgeon from [[London]], played an important role in developing the study of PCS.<ref name=LevinHS/> The controversy surrounding the cause of PCS was started in 1866 when Erichsen published a paper about persisting symptoms after sustaining mild head trauma.<ref name="Hall05"/> He suggested that the condition was due to injury by "molecular disarrangement" to the spine, and the condition was originally called "railroad spine" because most of the injuries studied had happened to railroad workers.<ref name="Hall05"/> While some of his contemporaries agreed that the syndrome had an organic basis, others attributed the symptoms to psychological factors or to outright feigning.<ref name=LevinHS/>  In 1879, the idea that a physical problem was responsible for the symptoms was challenged by Rigler, who suggested that the cause of the persisting symptoms was actually "compensation neurosis": the railroad's practice of compensating workers who had been injured was bringing about the complaints.<ref name="Hall05"/>  Later, the idea that [[hysteria]] was responsible for the symptoms after a mild head injury was suggested by [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]].<ref name="Hall05"/><ref name="Evans04"/>  Controversy about the syndrome continued through the 20th&nbsp;century.<ref name="Evans04"/> During World War I many soldiers suffered from puzzling symptoms after being close to a detonation but showing no evidence of a head wound. The illness was called ''shell shock'', and a psychological explanation was eventually favoured.<ref name="Jones07"/> The current concept of PCS had replaced ideas of hysteria as the cause of post-concussion symptoms by 1934.<ref name="Hall05"/> British authorities banned the term ''shell shock'' during World War II to avoid an epidemic of cases, and the term ''posttrauma concussion state'' was coined in 1939 to describe "disturbance of consciousness with no immediate or obvious pathologic change in the brain".<ref name="Jones07">{{cite journal |author=Jones E, Fear NT, Wessely S |title=Shell shock and mild traumatic brain injury: A historical review |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=11 |pages=1641–5 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17974926 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07071180 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/164/11/1641}}</ref> The term ''postconcussion syndrome'' was in use by 1941.<ref name="Jones07"/> In 1961, H.

==Controversy==

No definition of PCS is accepted by all health professionals,<ref name="Legome"/> and doubt exists about the validity of the diagnosis.  One reason for this is that symptoms of PCS also occur in people who have no history of head injury, but who have other medical and psychological complaints.<ref name="Iverson2005"/> In one study, 80% of healthy, uninjured people reported having three or more symptoms similar to those found after concussion.<ref name="AndersonT"/> In another study, 64% of people with TBI met the criteria set out by the [[ICD-10]] for post-concussion syndrome, but so did 40% of people that had injuries not to the head; 11% of those with brain injuries and 7% of those with other injuries met the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] criteria for post-concussion syndrome (see [[#Diagnosis|diagnosis]], below).<ref name="McCrea08">

Headaches is one of the criteria for PCS, but it is notably controversial where these headaches come from.

In a [[syndrome]], a set of symptoms is consistently present, and symptoms are linked such that the presence of one symptom suggests that of others.

</ref> The fact that the persistence of one symptom is not necessarily linked to that of another has similarly led to doubt about whether "syndrome" is the appropriate term.<ref name="McAllister02"/>

A longstanding controversy surrounding PCS concerns the nature of its [[etiology]]&nbsp;– that is, the cause behind it<ref name="Yeates05"/>&nbsp;– and the degree to which psychological factors and organic factors involving brain dysfunction are responsible. The debate has been referred to as '[[psychogenesis]] versus [[physiogenesis]]' (psychogenesis referring to a psychological origin for the condition, physiogenesis to a physical one).<ref name="Yeates05"/>
