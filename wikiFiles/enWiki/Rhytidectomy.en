A '''facelift''', technically known as a '''rhytidectomy''' (from Ancient Greek ῥυτίς (rhytis) “wrinkle” +  ἐκτομή (ektome) “excision”, surgical removal of wrinkles), is a type of [[cosmetic surgery]] procedure used to give a more youthful facial appearance. There are multiple surgical techniques. It usually involves the removal of excess facial skin, with or without the tightening of underlying tissues, and the redraping of the [[skin]] on the [[patient]]'s [[face]] and [[neck]]. Facelifts are effectively combined with eyelid surgery ([[blepharoplasty]]) and other facial procedures and are typically performed under general anesthesia or deep twilight sleep.

According to the most recent 2011 statistics from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, facelifts were the sixth most popular aesthetic surgery performed after [[liposuction]], [[breast augmentation]], [[abdominoplasty]] (tummy tuck), [[blepharoplasty]] (eyelid surgery) and [[breast lift]].

==History==

===Cutaneous Period (1900-1970)===
In the first 70 years of the 20th century facelifts were performed by pulling on the skin on the face and cutting the loose parts off. The first facelift was claimed to be performed by [[Eugen Höllander]] in 1901  in Berlin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Panfilov |first=Dimitrije E. |others=Trans. Grahame Larkin |title=Cosmetic Surgery Today |year=2005 |publisher=Thiene |location=New York, N.Y. |page=4 |isbn=1-58890-334-6 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}</ref> An elderly female polish aristocrat asked him to:  “lift her cheeks and corners of the mouth”. After much debate he finally proceeded to excise an elliptical piece of skin around the ears. The first textbook about facial cosmetic surgery (1907) was written by [[Charles Conrad Miller|Charles Miller]] (Chicago) entitled “The Correction of Featural Imperfections”. <ref>{{cite web | last=Kita | first=Natalie | title=The History of Plastic Surgery | url=http://plasticsurgery.about.com/od/historyofplasticsurgery/a/history_of_PS.htm | accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>

In the First World War (1914-1917) the Dutch surgeon [[Johannes Esser]] made one of the most famous discoveries in the field of plastic surgery to date, namely the “[[skin grafting|skin graft inlay technique]],”<ref>{{cite web | last=van Bergen | first=Leo | title=Mens of monster? Plastische chirurgie en de Eerste Wereldoorlog | url=http://www.wereldoorlog1418.nl/gezichtsverminkten/index.html#03}}</ref> the technique was soon used on both English and German sides in the war. At the same time the British plastic surgeon [[Harold Gillies|Harold Delfs Gillies]] used the Esser-graft to school all those who flocked towards him who wanted to study under him. That’s how he earned the name “Father of 20th Century Plastic Surgery”. In 1919 Dr. Passot was known to publish one of the first papers on face-lifting, this consisted mainly on the elevating and redraping of the facial skin. After this many others began to write papers on face-lifting in the 1920s. From then the esthetic surgery was being performed on a large scale, from the basis of the reconstructive surgery. The first female plastic surgeon, [[Suzanne Noël]], played a large role in its development and she wrote one of the first books about esthetic surgery named: “Chirurgie Esthetique, son rôle social.”

===SMAS Period (1970-1980)===
In 1968 [[Tord Skoog]] introduced the concept of subfacial dissection, therefore providing suspension of the stronger deeper layer rather than relying on skin tension to achieve his facelift (he publishes his technique in 1974, with subfacial dissection of the [[platysma]] without detaching the skin in a posterior direction). <ref>{{cite book|last=Skoog|first=Tord Gustav|title=Plastic Surgery: New Methods and Refinements|year=1974|publisher=Saunders|isbn=978-0721683553|pages=500}}</ref> In 1976 Mitz and Peyronie described the anatomical Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System, or SMAS, <ref>{{cite journal|last=Mitz|first=V.|coauthors=Peyronie M.|title=The superficial musculo-aponeurotic system (SMAS) in the parotid and cheek area|journal=Plast Reconstr Surg|year=1976|month=July|volume=58|series=1|pages=80–8|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/935283}}</ref> a term coined by [[Paul Tessier]], Mitz and Peyronie’s tutor in [[craniofacial surgery]], after he had become familiar with Skoog’s technique. After Skoog died of an heart attack, the [[superficial muscular aponeurotic system]] (SMAS) concept rapidly emerged to become the standard face-lifting technique, which was the first innovative change in facelift surgery in over 50 years. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Tessier|first=P.|title=Facelifting and frontal rhytidectomy|journal=Transactions of 7th international conference on Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|year=1979|month=september}}</ref>

===Deep Plane Period (1980-1991)===
Tessier, who had his background in the craniofacial surgery, made the step to a [[subperiosteal]] [[dissection]] via a coronal incision.  <ref>{{cite journal|last=Heinrichs|first=HL|coauthors=Kaidi, AA|title=Subperiosteal face lift: a 200-case, 4-year review.|journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery|date=1998 Sep|volume=102|issue=3|pages=843–55|pmid=9727455|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> In 1979, Tessier demonstrated that the subperiosteal undermining of the superior and lateral orbital rims allowed the elevation of the soft tissue and eyebrows with better results than the classic face-lifting. The objective was to elevate the soft tissue over the underlying skeleton to re-establish the patient's youthful appearance.

===Volumetric Period (1991-today)===
At the start of this period in the history of the facelift there was a change in conceptual thinking, surgeons started to care more about minimizing scars, restoring the [[subcutaneous]] volume that was lost during the ageing process and they started making use of a [[Anatomical terms of location|cranial]] direction of the “lift” instead of posterior. 

The technique for performing a facelift went from simply pull on the skin and sewing it back to aggressive SMAS and deep plane surgeries to a more refined facelift where variable options are considered to have an aesthetically good and a more long lasting effect.

==Indications==
[[File:Distance cilliary margin orbicularis oculi.jpg|thumb|The difference between an aged eye and a youthful eye, looking at the distance from the cilliary margin to the inferior-most point of the orbicularis oculi muscle.]]
[[File:Ageing of the human face.jpg|thumb|left|A. Increased redundancy of the nasolabial fold (caused by a descent of cheek fat)

C. Jowl (a broken jaw line by ptosis of the platysma muscle)

D. The intended effect of a facelift]]

A facelift is performed to [[rejuvenate]] the appearance of the face. Aging of the face is most shown by a change in position of the deep anatomical structures, which are the platysma muscle, cheek fat and the orbicularis oculi muscle.<ref name="Hamra">{{cite journal|last=Hamra|first=S.T.|title=Composite Rhytidectomy|journal=Plast Reconstr Surg|year=1997|month=April|volume=24|issue=2|pages=1–13}}</ref>  These lead up to three landmarks namely, an appearance of the jowl (a broken jaw line by [[:wikt:ptosis|ptosis]] of the platysma muscle), increased redundancy of the [[nasolabial fold]] (caused by a descent of cheek fat) and the increased distance from the ciliary margin to the inferior-most point of the [[orbicularis oculi muscle]] (caused by decreasing tone of the orbicularis oculi muscle). <ref name="Hamra"/>  The skin is a fourth component in the aging of the face. The ideal age for face-lifting is at age 50 or younger, as measured by patient satisfaction. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=BC|title=Rhytidectomy: current concepts, controversies and the state of the art.|journal=Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery|date=2012 Aug|year=2012|month=Augustus|volume=20|issue=4|pages=262–6|doi=10.1097/MOO.0b013e328355b175.|pmid=22894994|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last=Friel|first=M|coauthors=Shaw RE, Trovato MJ, Owsley JQ|title=The measure of face-lift patient satisfaction: the Owsley Facelift Satisfaction Survey with a long-term followup study|journal=Plast Reconstr Surg|year=2010|month=July|volume=126|issue=1|pages=245–57|pmid=20224460|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=TS|coauthors=Owsley, JQ|title=Long-term results of face lift surgery: patient photographs compared with patient satisfaction ratings.|journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery|date=2012 Jan|volume=129|issue=1|pages=253–62|pmid=22186515}}</ref> Some areas, such as the nasolabial folds or [[marionette lines]], in some cases can be treated more suitable with [[Botox]] or [[liposculpture]]. 

==Contraindications==
Contraindications to facelift surgery include severe [[concomitant]] medical problems, both physical and psychological. While not absolute contraindications, the risk of postoperative complications is increased in cigarette smokers and patients with hypertension and diabetes.<ref name="Rees2">{{cite journal|last=Rees|first=TD|coauthors=Liverett, DM; Guy, CL|title=The effect of cigarette smoking on skin-flap survival in the face lift patient.|journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery|date=1984 Jun|volume=73|issue=6|pages=911–5|pmid=6728942|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> These strong relative contraindications consist primarily of diseases predisposing to poor wound healing. Patients are typically asked to abstain from taking aspirin or other blood thinners for at least one week prior to surgery. Patients motivations and expectations are an important factor in order to determine the patient’s medical status. A psychiatric illness leading to unreasonable expectations for the surgical outcome, such as a distorted perception of reality, can be a contraindication to surgery. Some kinds of [[hypersensitivity]] to [[anesthesia]] are a contraindication.

* [[Superficial muscular aponeurotic system|SMAS]]
* [[Facial muscles|Facial musculature]]
* [[Facial nerve]]
:A dissection in the deep plane can mostly be performed safely, because the facial nerve innervates the facial muscles on the deep surface of these muscles (except for the muscles which are lying deep to the facial nerve, the [[mental nerve]], the [[levator anguli oris]] and the [[buccinator]]). The fibres of the nerve are becoming more superficially medially. Therefore, the dissection of a deep plane begins further away of the surface then it ends. This allows the undermining to be carried out towards the nasolabial fold without harming the branches of the facial nerve.
* Retaining ligaments
:The retaining ligaments in the face provide an anchorage of superficial structures to underlying bone. Four retaining ligaments exist.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Furnas|first=DW|title=The retaining ligaments of the cheek.|journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery|date=1989 Jan|volume=83|issue=1|pages=11–6|pmid=2909050|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref>  The platysma-cutaneous ligaments and the platysma-auricular ligament are aponeurotic condensations which connect the platysma to the dermis. The osteocutaneous ligaments, the zygomatic ligament and the mandibular ligament, are more important. They attach to the skin and bone, leading to a counteraction of gravitational forces. These ligaments should be released surgically to obtain a fully mobile facelift flap.
* [[Nasolabial folds]]
* Melolabial folds ([[marionette lines]])
* [[Greater auricular nerve]]
:Injury to the greater auricular nerve is the most seen nerve injury after rhytidectomy. <ref name="Moyer">{{cite journal|last=Moyer|first=JS|coauthors=Baker, SR|title=Complications of rhytidectomy.|journal=Facial plastic surgery clinics of North America|date=2005 Aug|volume=13|issue=3|pages=469–78|pmid=16085292|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> <ref name="Baker">{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=DC|title=Complications of cervicofacial rhytidectomy.|journal=Clinics in plastic surgery|date=1983 Jul|volume=10|issue=3|pages=543–62|pmid=6627843|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> Care should be taken in elevation over the sternocleidomastoid muscle, because of the terminal branches of the nerve that pass superficially to innervate the earlobe.
* [[Vascularisation]]
:The composite flap is vascularised by facial, angular and/or inferior orbital arteries. The [[facial artery]] supplies the platysma and goes on as the angular artery, which connects with the branches of the [[arteria supratrochlearis]] and [[arteria infraorbitalis]]. The parts of the face elevated are in continuity in the deep-plane and the composite rhytidectomy include the SMAS layer in the lower face, subcutaneous tissue and the skin as the arteries to these parts are preserved. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Whetzel|first=TP|coauthors=Mathes, SJ|title=The arterial supply of the face lift flap.|journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery|date=1997 Aug|volume=100|issue=2|pages=480–6; discussion 487–8|pmid=9252619|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref>  With this option you can create a well vascularized tissue flap, which can be used to tighten the skin without loss of vascularization, this will result in fewer complications like [[skin sloughing|skin slough]] and [[necrosis]].

==Procedure==
Many different procedures of rhytidectomy exist. <ref>{{cite web|title=Facelift (rhytidectomy) approach|url=https://www2.aofoundation.org/wps/portal/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hng7BARydDRwN3QwMDA08zTzdvvxBjIwN_I_2CbEdFADiM_QM!/?segment=Congenital&bone=CMF&approach=Facelift%20%28rhytidectomy%29%20approach&showPage=approach&contentUrl=/srg/95a/04-Approaches/A005_FaceliftAppr.jsp}}</ref> The differences are mostly the type of incision, the invasiveness and the area of the face that is treated. Each surgeon practices multiple different types of facelift surgery. At a consultation the procedure with the best outcome is chosen for every patient. Expectations of the patient, the age, possible recovery time  and areas to improve are some of the many factors taken in consideration before choosing a technique of rhytidectomy.   

In the traditional facelift, an incision is made in front of the ear extending up into the hairline. The incision curves around the bottom of the ear and then behind it, usually ending near the hairline on the back of the neck. After the skin incision is made, the skin is separated from the deeper tissues with a scalpel or scissors (also called undermining) over the cheeks and neck. At this point, the deeper tissues (SMAS, the fascial suspension system of the face) can be tightened with sutures, with or without removing some of the excess deeper tissues. The skin is then redraped, and the amount of excess skin to be removed is determined by the surgeon's judgement and experience. The excess skin is then removed, and the skin incisions are closed with [[sutures]] and [[staple (fastener)|staple]]s.

[[File:SMAS Facelift.jpg|thumb|left|The technique of a SMAS facelift, consisting of mobilisation, repositioning and fixating.]]
===SMAS lift===
The SMAS (Superficial Musculo Aponeurotic System) layer consist of suspensory ligaments that encase the cheek fat. Thereby causing them to remain in their normal position. Resuspension and securing the SMAS anatomical layer can lead to rejuvenation of the face, by counteracting aging and gravity caused [[ligamentous laxity|laxity]]. Modifications to this technique leaded  to development of the “Composite Facelift” and “Deep plane Facelift.” 

===Deep plane Facelift===
In order to correct the deepening of the nasolabial fold more accurate, the deep plane facelift was developed. Differing from the SMAS lift by freeing cheek fat and some muscles from their bone implement. This technique has a higher risk at damaging the facial nerve. The SMAS lift is an effective procedure to reposition the platysma muscle, however the nasolabial fold is according to some surgeons better addressed by a deep plane facelift or composite facelift.

===Composite Facelift===
As well as in the deep plane facelift, in the composite facelift a deeper layer of tissue is mobilised and repositioned. The difference between these operating techniques is the extra repositioning and fixation of the orbicularis oculi muscle in the composite facelift procedure. The malar crescent caused by the orbicularis oculi ptosis can be addressed in a composite facelift. 

===Mid Face-lift===
The mid face area, the area between the cheeks, flattens and makes a woman’s face look slightly more masculine. The mid face-lift is suggested to people where these changes occur, yet without a significant degree of [[jowling]] or sagging of the neck. In these cases a mid face-lift is sufficient to rejuvenate the face opposed to a full facelift, which is a more drastic surgery.
The ideal candidates for a mid face-lift is when a person is in his 40s, or if the cheeks appear to be sagging and the nasolabial area has laxity or skin folds. 
To achieve a younger appearance the surgeon makes several small incisions along the hairline and inside the mouth, this way the fatty tissue layers can be lifted and repositioned. This way there are practically no scars. The fatty layer that lays over the cheekbones is also lifted and repositioned. This improves the nose-to-mouth lines and the roundness over the cheekbones. The recovery time is rather short and this procedure is often combined with a blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery)

===Mini Facelift===
The mini facelift is the least invasive type of facelift which is similar to a full facelift, the only difference is the omission of the neck lift in the mini lift procedure. It is also called the ‘S’ lift because of the shape of the incision that is used or the ‘short-scar’ facelift. This lift is a more temporary solution to the ageing of the face which also has less downtime and is done on people who have deep nasolabial folds, sagging facial structures, yet still have a firm and well-contoured neck. The position of the incision is usually made from the hairline around the ear with scars hidden in the natural crease of the skin. The mini lift can be performed with an [[endoscope]], which is used to reposition the soft tissues. After this, the skin is repositioned by the surgeon with small sutures. This type of lift is a good alternative to the full facelift to people with premature ageing.[[File:Facelift incisions and undermining of different procedures.jpg|thumb|Blue represents the incisions in the Skin only facelift. Green represents the S-lift. Red is the extensive undermining done in several facelift techniques.]]

===Thread Lift===
The thread lift or feather lift is a less invasive surgical option, which is often used for people who seek minor improvements to treat sagging or laxity in the eye, forehead, and nasolabial fold areas. The lift can be performed under [[local anesthesia]], where the surgeon uses a barb suture technique. The threads that hold the skin into place will not be reabsorbed or be dissolved and remains in place. The thread plus the barbs are the only things keeping the lift in effect, as no skin is cut away. 
Specific complications of the thread lift include puckering skin, the visibility of the threads and the appearance of lumps. Treatment for these effects range from oral medications to surgical intervention. A study by Abraham RF suggest that the long term effects of this procedure are less esthetically pleasing than other surgical options. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Abraham|first=RF|coauthors=DeFatta, RJ; Williams EF, 3rd|title=Thread-lift for facial rejuvenation: assessment of long-term results.|journal=Archives of facial plastic surgery|date=2009 May-Jun|volume=11|issue=3|pages=178–83|pmid=19451452|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref>

===Subperiosteal Facelift===
The subperiosteal facelift technique is done by vertically lifting the soft tissues of the face, completely separating it from the underlying facial bones and elevating it to a more esthetically pleasing position, correcting deep nasolabial folds and sagging cheeks. The technique is often combined with standard techniques, which provide a long-lasting rejuvenation of the face and is done in all age groups. The difference between this and other lifts is that the subperiosteal facelift has a longer period of facial swelling after the procedure.

===Skin-Only Facelift===
With the skin-only facelift only the skin of the face is lifted and not the underlying SMAS, muscles or other structures. The skin itself lacks the elasticity and laxity in older patiënts, that is why the longevity of this lift is short, usually the lift re-sags within 6 to 12 months after the procedure. The reason that this option is considered is that it has fewer complications and isn’t as technically demanding as the SMAS or other types of lifts.

===MACS Facelift===
The term MACS-lift – or Minimal Access Cranial Suspension lift – allows for the correction of sagging facial features through a short, minimal incision, elevating them vertically by suspending them from above.There are many advantages to having a MACS facelift versus a traditional facelift. For starters, the MACS-lift uses a shorter scar that is in front of the ear, instead of behind, which is much easier to hide. Overall, the MACS-lift surgery is safer because less skin is raised. This means that there is less risk of bleeding and nerve damage. The operation also takes less time, lasting 2.5 hours instead of the 3.5 hours that the traditional facelift requires. There is also a shorter recovery period, 2-3 weeks instead of 3-4 weeks. Finally, the results of the MACS-lift are very natural while the traditional facelift will often result in a "windswept" look. The MACS lift has been successfully used for to correct complication after thread-lift with APTOS<ref>Sapountzis S. et al Aesthetic Plast Surg. 2012 Dec;36(6):1307-10. doi: 10.1007/s00266-012-9975-1. Epub 2012 Oct 6. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23052379</ref>

==Complications==
The most common complication can be bleeding which usually requires a return to the operating room. Less common, but potentially serious, complications may include damage to the facial nerves and necrosis of the skin flaps or [[infection]]. Although the facial plastic surgeon attempts to prevent and minimise the risk of complications, a rhytidectomy has complications. As a risk to every operation, complications can be derived as a reaction to the anesthetics. 

[[Hematoma]] is the most seen complication after rhytidectomy. <ref name="Rees">{{cite journal|last=Rees|first=TD|coauthors=Aston, SJ|title=Complications of rhytidectomy.|journal=Clinics in plastic surgery|date=1978 Jan|volume=5|issue=1|pages=109–19|pmid=639438|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=SR|coauthors=Webster, RC|title="How I do it"--head and neck and plastic surgery.

Almost all of the hematomas occur within the first 24 hours after the rhytidectomy. <ref name="Rees"/> <ref name="Moyer"/> <ref name="Baker"/>

[[Nerve injury]] can be obtained during rhytidectomy. This kind of injury can be temporary or permanent and harm can be done to either [[sensory neuron|sensory]] or [[motor neuron|motor]] nerves of the face. As an sensory nerve, the [[great auricular nerve]] is the most common nerve to get injured at a facelift procedure. <ref name="Rees"/> <ref name="Baker"/> The most injured motor nerve is the facial nerve. <ref name="Baker"/> <ref>{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=DC|coauthors=Conley, J|title=Avoiding facial nerve injuries in rhytidectomy.

Skin necrosis can occur after a facelift operation. [[Smoking]] increases the risk of skin necrosis 12-fold. <ref name="Rees2"/> Scarring is considered a complication of facelift surgery. [[Hypertrophic]] scars can appear. A facelift requires skin incisions; however, the incisions in front of and behind the ear are usually inconspicuous. 

[[Hair loss]] in the portions of the incision within the hair-bearing scalp can rarely occur. A hairline distortion can result after undergoing a rhytidectomy. Especially facial hair by men after a facelift procedure. There is a high incidence of [[alopecia]] after rhytidectomy. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Leist|first=FD|coauthors=Masson, JK; Erich, JB|title=A review of 324 rhytidectomies, emphasizing complications and patient dissatisfaction.|journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery|date=1977 Apr|volume=59|issue=4|pages=525–9|pmid=847029}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=TJ|coauthors=Gordon, HL; Mosienko, P|title=Rhytidectomy: a statistical analysis.|journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery|date=1977 Jan|volume=59|issue=1|pages=24–30|pmid=831238}}</ref> The permanent hair loss is mostly seen at the incision site in the temporal areas. In men, the sideburns can be pulled backwards and upwards, resulting in an unnatural appearance if appropriate techniques are not employed to address this issue. Achieving a natural appearance following surgery in men can be more challenging due to their hair-bearing preauricular skin. 
In both men and women, one of the signs of having had a facelift can be an earlobe which is pulled forwards and/or distorted. If too much skin is removed, or a more vertical vector not employed, the face can assume a pulled-back, "windswept" appearance. This appearance can also be due to changes in bone structure that generally happen with age.[2]

Infection is a rare complication for patients who have undergone a rhytidectomy. <ref>{{cite journal|last=LeRoy JL|first=Jr|coauthors=Rees, TD; Nolan WB, 3rd|title=Infections requiring hospital readmission following face lift surgery: incidence, treatment, and sequelae.|journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery|date=1994 Mar|volume=93|issue=3|pages=533–6|pmid=8115508}}</ref> Staphylococcus is the most usual causative organism for an infection after facelift surgery. <ref name="Moyer"/>
