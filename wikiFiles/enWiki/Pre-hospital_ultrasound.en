'''Prehospital ultrasound''' is the specialized application of [[ultrasound]] by [[Emergency service|emergency responders]], such as paramedics,<ref>{{cite web|last=Bonadonna|first=Peter|title=Paramedic Ultrasound|url=http://www.ParamedicUltrasound.com|accessdate=12 May 2011}}</ref> to guide immediate care and [[first aid]] procedures. Like conventional ultrasound, it is a device that produces cyclic [[sound pressure]] to penetrate a medium (usually flesh, in this instance) and reveal details about the inner structure of the medium.<ref>Emergency Ultrasound Made Easy.

==Differences between prehospital ultrasound and conventional ultrasound==

Many [[emergency physician]]s now view screening ultrasound as a tool, and not a procedure or study. It is primarily used to quickly and correctly ascertain a limited set of internal injuries, specifically those injuries where conventional methods of determining them, such as trauma to the torso or heart, would either take too long, require too much time to prepare, or introduce greater risk to the patient.<ref>Emergency Ultrasound: Principles and Practice. Romolo Joseph Gaspari, J. Christian Fox, Paul R. Sierzenski. Mosby, 2005. ISBN 0-323-03750-X, 9780323037501</ref>

While conventional ultrasound can be a lengthy process, and is usually conducted with non-mobile units and advanced image filtering and manipulation built into the unit, emergency ultrasound is as simple and quick to operate as possible, and narrowly focused on a small set of criteria.<ref>Atlas of [[Emergency medicine|Emergency Medicine]]. Kevin J. Knoop, Lawrence B. Stack, Alan B. Storrow. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2002. ISBN 0-07-135294-5, ISBN 978-0-07-135294-9</ref>

==Indications==
Indications for the use of prehospital ultrasound are determining the severity of trauma to the midsection, determining immediate trauma or penetration of the [[heart]], and to process sources and extent of [[internal bleeding]]. Specific implementations vary, some areas use the German originated [[FAST]] scan system which focuses on fluids in the [[paracolic gutter]] and the Douglas and Morrison pouch. Others focus more on cardiac ultrasounds.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
As a part of the FAST exam, it is common for the examiner to quickly image the sliding lung against the chest wall to rule out pneumothorax. If the visceral and parietal lung have separated, the lung sliding will disappear indicating a probable pneumothorax. If lung sliding is seen, there is no significant pneumothorax.  This simple addition to the FAST exam can accurately identify lung collapse in only 1 additional minute.  This Enhanced FAST exam is often called EFAST.
Another useful indication is assessing intravascular volume by looking directly at the inferior vena cava (IVC). Large IVCs that don't collapse during inspiration suggest that there is plenty of blood returning to the heart. Cardiac imaging can give the provider a sense of ejection fraction and heart function. Patients with pulmonary embolism can have a markedly enlarged right ventricle during the event, giving additional clues to the provider for correct diagnosis and treatment. As time goes on, it is likely that there will be dozens of additional indications for field use.

==Prehospital ultrasound procedures==

In most cases, prehospital providers will employ the use of a portable ultrasound unit. In every instance, an attempt is made to find the area best suited to an ultrasound and utilize bare skin if possible. Resolution is vastly decreased if soundings must be made through any form of clothing.<ref>Robert Thomas.

There are two main areas of emergency ultrasound. The [[focused assessment with sonography for trauma|Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma]] (or fast) focuses on trying to ascertain if there is internal [[bodily fluid]] in blunt [[Blunt trauma|abdominal trauma]], in the areas between organs, which is a sign of severe internal injury.<ref>Introduction To Emergency Ultrasound: A Review Of Justifications, Indications And Significant Findings.

Both systems are scanning methodologies, they use identical equipment.<ref>Ma J, Mateer J, Ogata M. Prospective analysis of a rapid trauma ultrasound examination performed by emergency physicians.

==Strengths of prehospital sonography==
# It images [[muscle]], [[soft tissue]], and [[bone]] surfaces very well and is particularly useful for delineating the interfaces between solid and fluid-filled spaces, unlike most other methods of trauma diagnosis, which are little more than educated guesses. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
# It renders "live" images, where the operator can dynamically select the most useful section for review, and narrows down the problem area, rather than having to wait until the patient is at the hospital.
# It has no known long-term [[adverse effect|side effect]]s and rarely causes any discomfort to the patient.

==Weaknesses of prehospital sonography==
# Sonographic devices have trouble penetrating bone. For example, sonography of the adult brain is very limited. This means that in terms of trauma diagnosis involving concussions, sonography will not work. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
# The depth penetration of ultrasound is limited, making it difficult to image structures deep in the body, especially in obese patients.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
# The method is operator-dependent. A high level of skill and experience is needed to acquire good-quality images and make accurate diagnoses, which is one more skill that a limited EMS team must develop. Since most EMS teams are small and suffer high turnover, retaining qualified personnel can be difficult.
