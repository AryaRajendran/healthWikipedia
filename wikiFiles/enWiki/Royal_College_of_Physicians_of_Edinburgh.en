The '''Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh''' (RCPE) was established in the 17th century. While the RCPE is based in [[Edinburgh]], it is not solely a Scottish [[professional body]] - more than half of its 7,700 Fellows, Members, Associates and Affiliates live and practice medicine outside Scotland, in 86 countries and covering 55 specialties.

== Origin ==
The twenty-one founding [[Fellow]]s of the College, (one of whom was Dr William Lauder (1652-1724), brother of [[John Lauder, Lord Fountainhall]]), were concerned not only with the advancement of medicine as a reputable [[science]], but also with alleviating the miseries of Edinburgh's [[poverty|poor]] and needy.

The College acts in an advisory capacity to government and other organisations on many aspects of [[health]], [[social welfare|welfare]] and medical education. 

Following successful completion of the MRCP(UK) examination, doctors are eligible to become Members and, in time, Fellows of the College. 

The College was instrumental in founding the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]] in 1729 and, over the years, has influenced the development of medical schools in North America, Australasia, Asia and Africa. 

There is a separate [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]].

== Building ==
The building is located on Queen Street in Edinburgh.  Three figures stand above the entrance.  These are:  [[Aesculapius]], the Greek god of medicine and healing (left); [[Hygieia]], Greek god of cleanliness (centre/top); and [[Hippocrates]], with the hypocratic oath (right).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/114105/digital_images/edinburgh+9+10+queen+street+royal+college+of+physicians/ |title=Site Record for Edinburgh, 9-10 Queen Street, Royal College Of Physicians Edinburgh |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/journal/issue/journal_38_1/emslie-smith.pdf |title=Is the College an Asklepieion? |author=D Emslie Smith |year=2008 |work= |publisher=J R Coll Physicians Edinburgh |accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>
The RCPE building, located at 9 Queen Street, was designed by the Edinburgh architect Thomas Hamilton, and was built between 1844 and 1846. In 1868 the College purchased the adjacent building at 8 Queen Street, which had been built by the renowned and influential Edinburgh architect Robert Adam in 1771. The Physicians Hall, as the conjoined buildings are now collectively known, is a superb example of eighteenth century architecture; both the exterior and interior are extremely well preserved despite modernization.<ref>Royal Commission of Ancient and Historic Monuments Scotland, Canmore Site Records (http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/): 9 Queen Street; 8 Queen Street.</ref>
