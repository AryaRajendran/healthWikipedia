'''''Henipavirus''''' is a [[genus]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] ''[[Paramyxoviridae]]'', [[Order (biology)|order]] ''[[Mononegavirales]]'' containing three established species: '''Hendra virus''', '''Nipah virus''' and '''Cedar Virus'''. The henipaviruses are naturally harboured by [[Pteropus|Pteropid]] [[fruit bat]]s (flying foxes) and some microbat species.<ref>[Li Y, Wang J, Hickey AC, Zhang Y, Li Y, Wu Y, ''et al.''

In 2009, RNA sequences of three novel viruses in phylogenetic relationship to known Henipaviruses were detected in ''[[Eidolon helvum]]'' (the African Straw-coloured fruit bat) in Ghana. The finding of these novel putative Henipaviruses outside Australia and Asia indicates that the region of potential endemicity of Henipaviruses extends to Africa.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Drexler JF, Corman VM, Gloza-Rausch F, Seebens A, Annan A ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | title = Henipavirus RNA in African Bats | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 7| page = e6367 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0006367 }}</ref>

At the core is a single helical strand of genomic [[RNA]] tightly bound to N ([[nucleocapsid]]) protein and associated with the L (large) and P (phosphoprotein) proteins which provide [[RNA polymerase]] activity during replication.

Embedded within the lipid membrane are spikes of F (fusion) protein trimers and G (attachment) protein tetramers. The function of the G protein is to attach the virus to the surface of a host cell via [[EFNB2]], a highly conserved protein present in many mammals.<ref name="bonaparte">{{cite journal |author=Bonaparte, M; Dimitrov, A; Bossart, K; ''et al.'' |year=2005 |title=Ephrin-B2 ligand is a functional receptor for Hendra virus and Nipah virus |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A]] |volume=102 |issue=30 |pages=10652–7 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0504887102 |pmid=15998730 |pmc=1169237 }}</ref><ref name="negrete">{{cite journal |author=Negrete OA, Levroney EL, Aguilar HC, ''et al.'' |title=EphrinB2 is the entry receptor for Nipah virus, an emergent deadly paramyxovirus |journal=Nature |volume=436 |issue=7049 |pages=401–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16007075 |doi=10.1038/nature03838 }}</ref> The F protein fuses the viral membrane with the host cell membrane, releasing the virion contents into the cell. It also causes infected cells to fuse with neighbouring cells to form large, multinucleated [[syncytia]].

==Genome structure==
As with all viruses in the ''Mononegavirales'' order, the Hendra virus and Nipah virus genomes are non-segmented, single-stranded [[sense (molecular biology)|negative-sense]] RNA. Both genomes are 18.2 kb in size and contain six [[gene]]s corresponding to six structural proteins.<ref name=wang>{{cite journal |author=Wang L, Harcourt BH, Yu M, ''et al.'' |title=Molecular biology of Hendra and Nipah viruses |journal=Microbes Infect. |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=279–87 |year=2001 |pmid=11334745 |doi= 10.1016/S1286-4579(01)01381-8|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1286457901013818}}</ref>

In common with other members of the ''Paramyxovirinae'' subfamily, the number of [[nucleotide]]s in the henipavirus genome is a multiple of six, consistent with what is known as the 'rule of six'.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kolakofsky|first=D|coauthors=Pelet, T; Garcin, D; Hausmann, S; Curran, J; Roux, L|title=Paramyxovirus RNA synthesis and the requirement for hexamer genome length: the rule of six revisited.|journal=Journal of Virology|date=February 1998|volume=72|issue=2|pages=891–9|pmid=9444980|pmc=124558}}</ref> Deviation from the rule of six, through mutation or incomplete genome synthesis, leads to inefficient viral replication, probably due to structural constraints imposed by the binding between the RNA and the N protein.

Henipaviruses employ an unusual process called [[RNA editing]] to generate multiple proteins from a single gene. The specific process in henipaviruses involves the insertion of extra [[guanosine]] residues into the P gene [[mRNA]] prior to [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. The number of residues added determines whether the P, V or W proteins are synthesised. The functions of the V and W proteins are unknown, but they may be involved in disrupting host antiviral mechanisms.

==Hendra virus==

===Emergence===
Hendra virus (originally ''Equine [[morbillivirus]]'') was discovered in September 1994 when it caused the deaths of thirteen [[horse]]s, and a trainer at a training complex in [[Hendra, Queensland|Hendra]], a suburb of [[Brisbane]] in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].<ref name=Selvey>{{cite journal |author=Selvey LA, Wells RM, McCormack JG, ''et al.'' |title=Infection of humans and horses by a newly described morbillivirus |journal=Med. J. Aust. |volume=162 |issue=12 |pages=642–5 |year=1995 |pmid=7603375 }}</ref>

The [[index case]], a mare, was housed with 19 other horses after falling ill, and died two days later. Subsequently, all of the horses became ill, with 13 dying. The remaining 6 animals were subsequently euthanised as a way of preventing relapsing infection and possible further transmission.<ref>[http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/4790_11112.htm#Experimental "Hendra virus: the initial research" Accessed 12 July 2011]</ref>  The trainer, Victory ('Vic') Rail, and a stable hand were involved in nursing the index case, and both fell ill with an influenza-like illness within one week of the first horse’s death. The stable hand recovered while Mr Rail died of respiratory and [[renal failure]]. The source of the virus was most likely frothy nasal discharge from the index case.

A second [[outbreak]] occurred in August 1994 (chronologically preceding the first outbreak) in [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] 1,000&nbsp;km north of Brisbane resulting in the deaths of two horses and their owner.<ref name=field>{{cite journal |author=Field H, Young P, Yob JM, Mills J, Hall L, Mackenzie J |title=The natural history of Hendra and Nipah viruses |journal=Microbes Infect. |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=307–14 |year=2001 |pmid=11334748 |doi= 10.1016/S1286-4579(01)01384-3|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1286-4579(01)01384-3}}</ref> The owner, Mark Preston, assisted in [[necropsy|necropsies]] of the horses and within three weeks was admitted to hospital suffering from [[meningitis]]. Mr Preston recovered, but 14 months later developed neurologic signs and died. This outbreak was diagnosed retrospectively by the presence of Hendra virus in the brain of the patient.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/hendra-death-toll-hits-13-for-month/story-e6frg6nf-1226100095361 "Hendra death toll hits 13 for month " accessed 24 July 2011]</ref>

A survey of wildlife in the outbreak areas was conducted, and identified [[Pteropodidae|pteropid]] fruit bats as the most likely source of Hendra virus, with a [[seroprevalence]] of 47%. All of the other 46 species sampled were negative. Virus isolations from the reproductive tract and urine of wild bats indicated that transmission to horses may have occurred via exposure to bat urine or birthing fluids.<ref name=halpin>{{cite journal |author=Halpin K, Young PL, Field HE, Mackenzie JS |title=Isolation of Hendra virus from pteropid bats: a natural reservoir of Hendra virus |journal=J.

However, the only attempt at experimental infection reported in the literature, conducted at CSIRO Geelong, did not result in infection of a horse from infected flying foxes. This study looked at potential infection between bats, horses and cats, in various combinations. The only species that was able to infect horses was the cat (''Felix spp.'').<ref name =Williamson>{{cite journal |author=MM WILLIAMSON.PT HOOPER,PW SELLECK,LJ GLEESON,PW DANIELS,HA WESTBURY and PK MURRAY,CSIRO,Austalian Animal Heath Laboratory,PO Bag24, Geelong, Victoria 3220 |title=Transmission studies of Hendra virus (equine morbillivirus) in fruit bats, horses and cats |journal=Aust Vet J. |volume=76 |pages=813–818 |year=1993}}</ref>

As of September 2012, a total of thirty-nine outbreaks of Hendra virus have occurred in Australia, all involving infection of horses. As a result of these events, seventy-six horses have died or been euthanised, with a further four having died or been euthanised as a result of possible hendra infection. Case fatality rate in humans is 60% and in horses 75%.<ref name=Field2011>{{cite journal | author = Field H, de Jong C, Melville D, Smith C, Smith I, Broos A, Kung YH, McLaughlin A, Zeddeman A ''et al.'' | year = 2011 | title = Hendra virus infection dynamics in Australian fruit bats | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 12| page = e28678 }}</ref>

Four of these outbreaks have spread to humans as a result of direct contact with infected horses. On 26 July 2011 a dog living on the Mt Alford property was reported to have HeV antibodies, the first time an animal other than a flying fox, horse, or human has tested positive outside an experimental situation.<ref>"Chief vet says dog hendra case 'unprecedented'", 612 ABC Brisbane, http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-26/hendra-virus-infects-dog/2811204/?site=brisbane&section=news, first posted 26 July 2011 15:39:31, updated 27 July 2011 06:18:33.</ref>

These events have all been on the east coast of Australia, with the most northern event at Cairns, Queensland and the event furthest south at Macksville, NSW. Until the event at Chinchilla, Queensland in July 2011, all outbreak sites had been within the distribution of at least two of the four mainland flying-foxes (fruit bats); [[Little red flying-fox]], ''([[Pteropus scapulatus]])'', [[Black Flying Fox|black flying-fox]], ''([[Pteropus alecto]])'', [[grey-headed flying fox|grey-headed flying-fox]], ''([[Pteropus poliocephalus]])'' and [[spectacled flying fox|spectacled flying-fox]], ''([[Pteropus conspicillatus]])''. Chinchilla is considered to be only within the range of little red flying-fox and is west of the [[Great Dividing Range]]. This is the furthest west the infection has ever been identified in horses.

The timing of incidents indicates a seasonal pattern of outbreaks, possibly related to the breeding cycle of the little red flying-foxes. These species typically give birth between April and May.<ref>[http://www.wildlife.org.au/wildlife/speciesprofile/mammals/flyingfox/littlered_flyingfox.html "Little red flying-fox"]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Plowright RK ''et al.'' | year = | title = Reproduction and nutritional stress are risk factors for Hendra virus infection in little red flying foxes (Pteropus scapulatus) | url = | journal = Proc. R. Soc. B | volume = 275 | issue = 1636| pages = 861–869 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2007.1260 }}</ref> As there is no evidence of transmission to humans directly from bats, it is thought{{who|date=November 2012}} that human infection only occurs via an intermediate host, a horse.

===Events of June – August 2011===
In the years 1994–2010, fourteen events were recorded. Between 20 June 2011 and 28 August 2011, a further seventeen events were identified, during which twenty-one horses died.

It's not clear why there has been a sudden increase in the number of spillover events between June and August 2011. Typically HeV spillover events are more common between May and October. This time is sometimes called "Hendra Season".,<ref>Epidemiological methodolgy of communicating higher contagion periods for better common, non-scientific individual understanding</ref> which is a time when there are large numbers of fruit bats of all species congregated in SE Queensland's valuable winter foraging habitat. The weather (warm and humid) is favourable to the survival of henipavirus in the environment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fogarty|first=R.D.|coauthors=Halpin, K., Hyatt, A.D., Daszak, P., & Mungall, B.A.|journal=Virus Research|year=2008|volume=132 (1–2)|pages=140–144|doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2007.11.010}}</ref>

It is possible [[2010–2011 Queensland floods|flooding in SE Queensland]] and Northern NSW in December 2010 and January 2011 may have had an impact on the health of the fruit bats. Urine sampling in flying-fox camps indicate that a larger proportion of flying-foxes than usual are shedding live virus. Biosecurity Queensland's ongoing surveillance usually shows 7% of the animals are shedding live virus. In June and July nearly 30% animals have been reported to be shedding live virus.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/animals/nearly-a-third-of-bats-now-carry-hendra-researchers-20110727-1i03j.html "Nearly a third of bats now carry Hendra: researchers" accessed 29 July 2011]</ref>  Present advice is that these events are not being driven by any mutation in HeV itself.<ref>[http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/fearon-family-plead-with-authorities-for-stay-of-execution-for-hendra-positive-dog-dusty/story-e6freoof-1226103007834 "Fearon family plead with authorities for stay of execution for Hendra positive dog Dusty" accessed 28 July 2011]</ref>

Other suggestions include that an increase in testing has led to an increase in detection. As the actual mode of transmission between bats and horses has not been determined, it is not clear what, if any, factors can increase the chance of infection in horses.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2011/07/04/3260213.htm "Hendra virus research continues as more horses contract the disease" accessed 5 July 2011]</ref>

Following the confirmation of a dog with HeV antibodies, on 27 July 2011, the Queensland and [[Government of New South Wales|NSW governments]] will boost research funding into the Hendra virus by $6 million to be spent by 2014/2015. This money will be used for research into ecological drivers of infection in the bats and the mechanism of virus transmission between bats and other species.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/animals/new-hunt-for-hendra-in-other-species-20110727-1hzp9.html "New hunt for Hendra in other species" accessed 27 July 2011]</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-27/urgent-funds-for-hendra-research/2812722 "Urgent funds for hendra research" accessed 27 July 2011]</ref> A further 6 million dollars was allocated by the federal government with the funds being split, half for human health investigations and half for animal health and biodiversity research.<ref>[http://www.maff.gov.au/media_office/media_releases/media_releases/2011/july/gillard-government-helping-in-response-to-hendra "Gillard Government helping in response to Hendra" accessed 11 August 2011]</ref>

* '''Vaccine for horses.''' In November 2012, a vaccine became available for horses. The vaccine is to be used in horses only, since, according to [[CSIRO]] veterinary pathologist Dr Deborah Middleton, breaking the transmission cycle from flying foxes to horses prevents it from passing to humans, as well as, "a vaccine for people would take many more years."<ref>[http://www.thehorse.com/articles/30801/equine-hendra-virus-vaccine-launched-in-australia "Equine Henda Virus Vaccine Launched in Australia".

* '''Post-exposure treatment for humans.'''

Nipah virus and Hendra virus are closely related paramyxoviruses that emerged from bats during the 1990s to cause deadly outbreaks in humans and domesticated animals. [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID)-supported investigators developed vaccines for Nipah and Hendra virus based on the soluble [[G-glycoproteins]] of the viruses formulated with adjuvants. Both vaccines have been shown{{who|date=November 2012}} to induce strong neutralizing [[antibodies]] in different laboratory animals.

===Pathology===
[[Flying fox]]es experimentally infected with the Hendra virus develop a [[viraemia]] then excrete the virus in their urine, faeces and saliva for approximately one week. Although they excrete live virus during this time there is no other indication of an illness.<ref>[http://www1.abcrc.org.au/uploads/8aee9ac0-1355-4339-b5b6-5772a4ee6cf7/docs/HeV_Review_updated170909.pdf "Research update: Hendra Virus" accessed 17 July 2011]</ref> Symptoms of Hendra virus infection of humans may be respiratory, including [[hemorrhage]] and [[pulmonary edema|edema]] of the lungs, or [[encephalitis|encephalitic]], resulting in [[meningitis]]. In horses, infection usually causes [[pulmonary oedema]], congestion and / or neurological signs.<ref>[http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/documents/Biosecurity_GeneralAnimalHealthPestsAndDiseases/HeV-Initial-experimental-characterisation.pdf "Initial experimental characterisation of HeV (Redland Bay 2008) infection in horses" accessed 17 July 2011]</ref>

==Nipah virus==

===Emergence===
[[Image:Pteropus vampyrus2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''Pteropus vampyrus'' ([[Large flying fox]]), one of the natural reservoirs of Nipah virus]]
Nipah virus was identified in April 1999, when it caused an outbreak of neurological and respiratory disease on pig farms in peninsular [[Malaysia]], resulting in 257 human cases, including 105 human deaths and the culling of one million pigs.<ref name=field/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Update: outbreak of Nipah virus—Malaysia and Singapore, 1999 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |volume=48 |issue=16 |pages=335–7 |date=30 April 1999 |pmid=10366143 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00057012.htm |author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> In [[Singapore]], 11 cases, including one death, occurred in abattoir workers exposed to pigs imported from the affected Malaysian farms.  The Nipah virus has been classified by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] as a Category C agent.<ref>[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp bt.cdc.gov]</ref> The name "Nipah" refers to the place, Kampung Baru Sungai Nipah in Negeri Sembilan State, Malaysia, the source of the human case from which Nipah virus was first isolated.<ref name="Siva2009">{{cite journal|author = Siva SR, Chong HT, Tan CT | year = 2009 | journal = Neurology Asia | pages = 53–58 | volume = 14 | title = Ten year clinical and serological outcomes of Nipah virus infection | url = http://www.neurology-asia.org/articles/20091_053.pdf}}</ref>

The outbreak was originally mistaken for [[Japanese encephalitis]] (JE), however, physicians in the area noted that persons who had been vaccinated against JE were not protected, and the number of cases among adults was unusual<ref>[http://www.vadscorner.com/veo.html Dobbs and the viral encephalitis outbreak]. Archived thread from the Malaysian "Doctors Only BBS".</ref> Despite the fact that these observations were recorded in the first month of the outbreak, the Ministry of Health failed to react accordingly, and instead launched a nationwide campaign to educate people on the dangers of JE and its vector, [[Culex]] mosquitoes.

Symptoms of infection from the Malaysian outbreak were primarily encephalitic in humans and respiratory in pigs. Later outbreaks have caused respiratory illness in humans, increasing the likelihood of human-to-human transmission and indicating the existence of more dangerous strains of the virus.

Based on seroprevalence data and virus isolations, the primary reservoir for Nipah virus was identified as Pteropid fruit bats, including ''Pteropus vampyrus'' ([[Large Flying Fox]]), and ''Pteropus hypomelanus'' ([[Small Flying-fox]]), both of which occur in Malaysia.

The transmission of Nipah virus from flying foxes to pigs is thought to be due to an increasing overlap between bat habitats and piggeries in peninsular Malaysia. At the index farm, fruit orchards were in close proximity to the piggery, allowing the spillage of urine, faeces and partially eaten fruit onto the pigs.<ref name=chua>{{cite journal |author=Chua KB, Chua BH, Wang CW |title=Anthropogenic deforestation, El Niño and the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia |journal=Malays J Pathol |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=15–21 |year=2002 |pmid=16329551 }}</ref> Retrospective studies demonstrate that viral spillover into pigs may have been occurring in Malaysia since 1996 without detection.<ref name="field"/> During 1998, viral spread was aided by the transfer of infected pigs to other farms, where new outbreaks occurred.

===Outbreaks===

Eight more outbreaks of Nipah virus have occurred since 1998, all within [[Bangladesh]] and neighbouring parts of [[India]]. The outbreak sites lie within the range of Pteropus species (''Pteropus giganteus''). As with Hendra virus, the timing of the outbreaks indicates a seasonal effect.  Cases occurring in Bangladesh during the winters of 2001, 2003, and 2004, were determined to have been caused by the Nipah virus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chadha MS, Comer JA, Lowe L, Rota PA, Rollin PE, Bellini WJ, Ksiazek TG, Mishra A |title=Nipah virus-associated encephalitis outbreak, Siliguri, India |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=235–40 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16494748 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol12no02/05-1247.htm#1}}</ref> In February 2011, a Nipah outbreak began at [[Hatibandha Upazila]] in the  [[Lalmonirhat District]] of northern Bangladesh.

No infection of humans or other species have been observed in Cambodia, Thailand or Africa thus far.

===Pathology===
In humans, the infection presents as fever, headache and drowsiness. Cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weakness, problems with swallowing and blurred vision are relatively common. About a quarter of the patients have seizures and about 60% become comatose and might need mechanical ventilation. In patients with severe disease, their conscious state may deteriorate and they may develop severe hypertension, fast heart rate, and very high temperature.

Nipah virus is also known to cause relapse encephalitis. In the initial Malaysian outbreak, a patient presented with relapse encephalitis some 53 months after his initial infection. There is no definitive treatment for Nipah encephalitis, apart from supportive measures, such as mechanical ventilation and prevention of secondary infection. [[Ribavirin]], an antiviral drug, was tested in the Malaysian outbreak, and the results were encouraging, though further studies are still needed.

While no vaccine currently exists, a recent (2012) study of a trial vaccine developed using the outer proteins of [[Hendra_virus#Hendra_virus|Hendra virus]] was shown to induce protection against Nipah in African Green Monkeys.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bossart K.

In animals, especially in pigs, the virus causes a porcine respiratory and neurologic syndrome, locally known as "barking pig syndrome" or "one mile cough."

[[Ephrin B2]] has been identified as the main receptor for the henipaviruses.<ref name="Lee2011"/>

Nipah virus was the inspiration for the MEV-1 virus in the film ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]''.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/uh-oh-scientists-film-contagion-real-080355672.html Uh-oh: Scientists say film 'Contagion' is for real]</ref>

==Cedar virus==

===Emergence===
Cedar Virus (CedPV) was first identified in pteropid urine during work on Hendra virus undertaken in Queensland in 2009.<ref name="plospathogens.org">[http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1002836 "Cedar Virus: A Novel Henipavirus Isolated from Australian Bats" accessed 4 August 2012]</ref>

Although the virus is reported to be very similar to both Hendra and Nipah, it does not cause illness in laboratory animals usually susceptible to paramyxoviruses. Animals were able to mount an effective response and create effective antibodies.<ref name="plospathogens.org"/>

The scientists who identified the virus report:

:''Hendra and Nipah viruses are 2 highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses that have emerged from bats within the last two decades. Both are capable of causing fatal disease in both humans and many mammal species. Serological and molecular evidence for henipa-like viruses have been reported from numerous locations including Asia and Africa, however, until now no successful isolation of these viruses have been reported. This paper reports the isolation of a novel paramyxovirus, named Cedar virus, from fruit bats in Australia. Full genome sequencing of this virus suggests a close relationship with the henipaviruses. Antibodies to Cedar virus were shown to cross react with, but not cross neutralize Hendra or Nipah virus. Despite this close relationship, when Cedar virus was tested in experimental challenge models in ferrets and guinea pigs, we identified virus replication and generation of neutralizing antibodies, but no clinical disease was observed. As such, this virus provides a useful reference for future reverse genetics experiments to determine the molecular basis of the pathogenicity of the henipaviruses.''<ref name="plospathogens.org"/>

==Causes of emergence==
The emergence of henipaviruses parallels the emergence of other [[Zoonosis|zoonotic]] viruses in recent decades. [[SARS coronavirus]], [[Australian bat lyssavirus]], [[Menangle virus]] and probably [[Ebola virus]] and [[Marburg virus]] are also harbored by bats and are capable of infecting a variety of other species. The emergence of each of these viruses has been linked to an increase in contact between bats and humans, sometimes involving an intermediate domestic animal host. The increased contact is driven both by human encroachment into the bats’ territory (in the case of Nipah, specifically pigpens in said territory) and by movement of bats towards human populations due to changes in food distribution and loss of habitat.

There is evidence that habitat loss for flying-foxes, both in South Asia and Australia (particularly along the east coast) as well as encroachment of human dwellings and agriculture into the remaining habitats, is creating greater overlap of human and flying fox distributions.
