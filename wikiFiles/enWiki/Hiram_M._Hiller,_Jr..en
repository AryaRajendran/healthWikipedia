'''Hiram M. Hiller, Jr.''' (1867–1921), was an American physician, medical missionary, explorer, and [[ethnographer]].  He traveled in [[Oceania]] and in [[South Asia|South]], [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]], and [[East Asia]], returning with [[Archeology|archeological]], cultural, [[Zoology|zoological]], and [[Botany|botanical]] specimens and data for museums, lectures and publications.  His notes and collections provide valuable information about those regions and their people from the late 19th century.

==Family and early life==

Hiram Milliken Hiller (1834–1895) and the former Sarah Fulton Bell (1837–1915), who were both from Pennsylvania.  He was the third of their six children who survived to adulthood.  The elder Hiller, a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran and lawyer, was a prominent citizen of [[Clark County, Missouri]], and was instrumental in the success of [[Kahoka]] until his death in a [[railroad]] accident.<ref name="WMHC">Western Historical Manuscript Collection - Columbia, [http://whmc.umsystem.edu/invent/3856.html Hiller Family Papers, 1785-1993 (3856)], University of Missouri.

The younger Hiller attended [[Parsons College]] in Iowa, earning his B.S. in 1887.<ref>General Alumni Society, University of Pennsylvania, ''General Alumni Catalogue of the University of Pennsylvania'', 1917.</ref>  He moved to Philadelphia to attend medical school at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  While there, he met several other men of similar interests, including William H. Furness, III (1867–1920, the son of Shakespearean scholar [[Horace Howard Furness]] and nephew of architect [[Frank Furness]]), and Alfred Craven Harrison, Jr. (1869–1925).  Hiller graduated in 1891 and served his residency at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital and at nearby Blockley Hospital.<ref name="PennLib">Finding Aid, [http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/ead/upenn_museum_PUMu1060 Furness, Harrison and Hiller expedition records, 1060], University of Pennsylvania Libraries.

==Expeditions==

Hiller, Furness, and Harrison embarked on a series of expeditions to [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. The three did not always travel together, and the records of their travels are fragmentary in places.  Their first two voyages are the best-documented; the last voyage the worst.<ref name="PennLib" />

;First expedition (1895–1896)
In October 1895, Hiller, Furness, and Harrison left the United States, using their own money to search for the fabled [[Dayak people|Dayak]] [[Headhunting|headhunters]] of [[Borneo]] to collect ethnological specimens for the new [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]. On their way to the South Seas, they stopped at [[Yokohama]], [[Amami]], and [[Okinawa]], among other places in Japan, arriving in Borneo after seven months of travel from the United States.<ref name="PennLib" /><ref name="TokEmb" /> They spent four months traveling and collecting in Borneo,<ref name="TokEmb" /> although they did not always travel together. After leaving Borneo, they traveled to Singapore, Saigon, and China before returning to Japan, the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and the United States.  Hiller arrived in Kahoka on December 4, 1896.<ref name="PennLib" />

;Second expedition (1897–1898)
Five months later (May 1897), they were off to Borneo again.  Traveling by way of Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Saigon, they returned to Singapore and used it as a base for a number of expeditions into such places as [[Kalimantan]], [[Sarawak]], [[British Malaya]], and Tambak before returning the way they came.  They returned in August or September 1898.<ref name="PennLib" />

;Third Expedition (1899–1900)
Unlike their other expeditions, the third was an eastward journey.  They sailed for England on  June 14, 1899, traveling from London to Paris and Marseilles before boarding the ''Ernest Simon'' for Asia.  The voyage took them through the [[Suez Canal]] and to [[Djibouti]] before arriving in [[Colombo, Ceylon]].  They traveled in Ceylon, [[British India|India]], [[Burma]], and [[Australia]] before sailing for [[Hawaii]] (recently [[Territory of Hawaii|annexed by the United States]]) and [[Vancouver]], circling the world before returning home in May 1900.<ref name="PennLib" />

;Fourth expedition (1901)
Their last voyage may have been somewhat restricted by the realities of life (the three were all over 30 by this point).  Leaving Philadelphia in February 1901, they traveled to New Orleans and San Francisco before sailing for Honolulu and Yokohama aboard the ''Sir Coptic''.  They extensively toured Japan, particularly Hokkaido.<ref name="PennLib" />  Hiller met [[Jenichiro Oyabe]], a Japanese man who had been educated as a missionary at [[Yale University]] and [[Howard University]].  Oyabe served as a translator and a guide for a side-expedition to the [[Ainu people]], and consequently Hiller amassed a large collection of the objects of Ainu daily life<ref name="PennMus">Alison Miner, [http://pennmuseumarchives.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/the-ainu-people-and-an-early-anthropological-friendship-across-an-ocean/ The Ainu People and an Early Anthropological Friendship Across an Ocean], PennMuseumArchives, February 28, 2009. Accessed 2010.06.20.</ref> before proceeding to the [[East Indies]].<ref name="PennLib" />  Once Hiller returned home, he stayed in contact with Oyabe, who wrote him friendly letters encouraging him to “tell the world about my beloved Ainu people.”<ref name="PennMus" />

==Later life==
Hiller married Blanche Hayes, of [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]].  The wilds of the jungle were no place for a civilized woman; his exploring days were over.  Hiller managed a sugar plantation in Cuba for “a wealthy friend” (Harrison’s father was a sugar manufacturer, and Harrison entered his father’s business in 1902<ref name="PennLib" />) from 1902 to about 1907 in order to make money to bankroll his return to Philadelphia and the establishment of a medical practice.<ref name="WMHC" />

The Hillers settled in Rose Tree, at the north edge of [[Media, Pennsylvania]].  Hiller founded a clinic in nearby [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]] for poor workers in the factories there.<ref>Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania, ‘‘The Pennsylvania Medical Journal’’, Volume 21, pp. 395, 705 (1918).</ref><ref>The ''General Alumni Catalogue of the University of Pennsylvania'' (1917, p. 1068) gives his address as 522 W. 9th Street.</ref>  While there, he encountered a [[History_of_poliomyelitis#Epidemics|devastating outbreak of a disease that spread rapidly and paralyzed its victims]], especially children.  A few physicians in other towns were experiencing similar outbreaks.  They communicated, shared experiences, and realized not only that they were dealing with the same disease ([[Poliomyelitis|“infantile paralysis”]]), but that it was a form of polio, which apparently had taken a more damaging, virulent, epidemic form.

The Hillers had two daughters, Margaret Lynn (or Linn) and Virginia (“Ginny”).  Hiller died in 1921,<ref name="WMHC" /> possibly from complications from polio.  Blanche Hiller moved with her daughters to [[Lower Merion, Pennsylvania]], closer to Philadelphia, where she lived for several more decades.

==Collections==
Thanks in significant part to Hiller, the University Museum’s collection of Ainu artifacts is one of the largest in any museum, so much so that The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC) borrowed almost all of the collection to display in the Ainu Craft Exhibition 2008 at the Niigata Prefectural Museum of History in [[Nagaoka City]], Japan.<ref name="PennMus" />  The University Museum also holds 57 artifacts and 3 diaries Furness and Hiller brought back from Amami and Okinawa,<ref name="TokEmb" /> and the university library has additional materials.<ref name="PennMus" />
