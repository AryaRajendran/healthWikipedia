'''Segmented sleep''', also known as '''divided sleep''', '''bimodal sleep pattern''', or '''interrupted sleep''', is a [[polyphasic sleep|polyphasic]] or biphasic [[sleep]] pattern where two or more periods of sleep are punctuated by a period of wakefulness. Along with a nap ([[siesta]]) in the day, it has been argued that this is the natural pattern of human sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10607034 |year=1992 |author=Wehr |authorlink=Thomas A Wehr |title=In short photoperiods, human sleep is biphasic |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=103–107 |journal=Journal of sleep research |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2869.1992.tb00019.x}}</ref><ref>[[Russell G.

Historian A. Roger Ekirch (2001,2005) argues that before the Industrial Revolution, segmented sleep was the dominant form of human slumber in Western civilization. He draws evidence from documents from the ancient, medieval, and modern world, which he discovered over the course of sixteen years of research.<ref name=BBC>{{Cite news |first=Stephanie |last=Hegarty |title=The myth of the eight-hour sleep |work=[[BBC News]] |date=22 February 2012 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16964783}}</ref> Other historians, such as Craig Koslofsky,<ref>{{Cite book |first=Craig |last=Koslofsky |year=2011 |title=Evenings' empire: A history of the night in early modern Europe |page=6 |isbn=978-0-521-89643-6}}</ref> have endorsed Ekirch's discovery and analysis.

==Segmented sleep as a historical norm==
According to Ekirch's argument, typically individuals slept in two distinct phases, bridged by an intervening period of wakefulness of approximately one hour. [[Peasant]] couples, who were often too tired after field labor to do much more than eat and go to sleep, awoke later to have [[Sexual intercourse|sex]].<ref>A. Roger Ekirch (2005), ''At Day's Close: Night In Times Past'', pp. 308–310 ISBN 0-393-05089-0</ref> People also used this time to pray and reflect,<ref>Frances Quarles (London 1644), ''Enchirdion'' ch. 54</ref> and to interpret [[dream]]s, which were more vivid at that hour than upon waking in the morning. This was also a favorite time for scholars and poets to write uninterrupted, whereas still others visited neighbors, or engaged in petty crime.<ref>A. Roger Ekirch (2005), ''At Day's Close: Night In Times Past'', pp. 311–323 ISBN 0-393-05089-0</ref> 

The human [[circadian rhythm]] regulates the human sleep-wake cycle of wakefulness during the day and sleep at night. Ekirch suggests that it is due to the modern use of [[electric lighting]] that most modern humans do not practice segmented sleep, which is a concern for some scientists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/jessa_gamble_how_to_sleep.html |title=Jessa Gamble: Our natural sleep cycle &#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-22}}</ref> Superimposed on this basic rhythm is a secondary one of light sleep in the early afternoon and quiet wakefulness in the early morning.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The brain exhibits high levels of the [[pituitary]] [[hormone]] [[prolactin]] during the period of nighttime wakefulness, which may contribute to the feeling of peace that many people associate with it.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} It is in many ways similar to the [[Hypnagogia|hypnagogic]] and [[hypnopompic]] states which occur just before falling asleep and upon waking, respectively.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The modern assumption that consolidated sleep with no awakenings is the normal and correct way for human adults to sleep may lead people to consult their doctors fearing they have maintenance [[insomnia]] or other [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=BBC/> If Ekirch's theory is correct, their concerns might best be addressed by reassurance that their sleep conforms to historically natural sleep patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Walter A., MD |date=2006-05-26 |title=Acknowledging Preindustrial Patterns of Sleep May Revolutionize Approach to Sleep Dysfunction |journal=Applied Neurology |publisher=CMPMedica |url=http://appneurology.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=188500785 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |quote=The discoveries of Ekirch and Wehr raise the possibility that segmented sleep is "normal" and, as such, these revelations hold significant implications for both understanding sleep and the treatment of insomnia.}}</ref>

The two periods of night sleep in Ekirch's theory were called "first sleep" (occasionally "dead sleep") and "second sleep" (or "morning sleep") in medieval [[England]]. Ekirch finds that first and second sleep were also the terms in the [[Romance languages]], as well as the [[Tiv people|Tiv]] of [[Nigeria]]: In French, the common term was ''premier sommeil'' or ''premier somme''; in Italian, ''primo sonno''; in Latin, ''primo somno'' or ''comcubia nocte''.<ref>A. Roger Ekirch (2005), ''At Day's Close: Night In Times Past'', pp. 301–302 ISBN 0-393-05089-0</ref> He found no common word in English for the period of wakefulness between, apart from paraphrases such as ''first waking'' or ''when one wakes from his first sleep'' and the generic ''watch'' (in its old meaning of being awake). In [[French language|French]] an equivalent generic term is ''dorveille'' ("twixt sleep and wake").

Ekirch suggests that, because members of modern industrialised societies, with late hours facilitated by electric lighting, mostly do not practice segmented sleep, they may misinterpret and mistranslate references to it in literature: common interpretations of the term "first sleep" are "beauty sleep" and "early slumber". A reference to first sleep in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' was translated as such in the 17th century, but, if Ekirch's theory is correct, was universally mistranslated in the 20th.<ref>A.

==Examples in early modern literature==
:I have known persons who have never indulged in a second sleep. One gentleman, who entertained a notion that a second nap was injurious, invariably got up as soon as he awoke, no matter how early the hour — winter or summer. 
::William Wadd. "Eating, Drinking, and Sleeping." ''Quarterly Journal of Science'' VIII 1828

:It was his custom to go to bed early after a light supper, and rising as soon as he awoke from his first sleep, about the time that monks say their matins, he wrapt his head in a kind of cowl, and spent four hours in deep study. 
::"Aimar de Ranconet". ''William A'Beckett's Universal Biography'', 1836

:Never was there a worse swindle perpetrated on humanity than that which asserts that when a man wakes from his first sleep he ought to get up. If he wakes thoroughly refreshed after seven hours sleep it is certainly time to turn and stretch, and, after about fifteen minutes grace, to dress; but he who wakes at early morn after a rest of about four or five hours, will do well to turn over and go to sleep again.
::''Philadelphia Record'', March 1, 1884

:—The people are in bed and after their first sleep now, he said.
::[[James Joyce]]. "[[Araby (short story)|Araby]]", 1914
