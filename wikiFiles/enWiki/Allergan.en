==History==
In 1948 Gavin S. Herbert, Sr., started a small ophthalmic business in a laboratory above one of his Los Angeles drugstores. Stanley Bly, who had only a bachelor's degree in chemistry, created the business's first product, an antihistamine eye drop named Allergan. Under the company name Allergan, Bly developed additional products, including a cortisone eye drop, Cortefrin. The small business was assisted by the salesmanship of Herbert's son, Gavin Herbert Jr., a 19-year-old student at the University of Southern California. In 1950, Allergan launched its first product, NASAL DROPS.

In 1953 Bly's sudden death almost caused the company to close. Sales at that time were approximately $25,000, and many of Bly's product formulas were undocumented. A young associate professor at the University of Southern California's School of Pharmacy, John Biles, reformulated Allergan's products and saved the company from failure. The next year, Allergan continued to struggle when Gavin Herbert, Jr., was drafted into the navy during the Korean War and Herbert, Sr., was involved in an automobile accident and was hospitalized for several months. Herbert, Jr., kept the company alive by commuting from his station in San Diego to Los Angeles on weekends. In 1957 Gavin Herbert, Jr., was discharged from the navy and Allergan sales had reached $100,000. 

In the late 1950s Allergan moved out of the upstairs laboratory into a 6,000-square-foot space in a converted Los Angeles theater. With the assistance of Jack Browning, an ad agency executive and former employee of SmithKline, Allergan also launched its first marketing plan. A key element of that plan was the advent of Allergan's first national product, Prednefrin, a corticosteroid. By 1960 Allergan was a million-dollar company and the company moved its operations to a 30,000-square-foot plant in Santa Ana, California. 

In 1962, Allergan achieved $1 million in eye care sales. In 1966, Worldwide corporate headquarters was established in Irvine by acquiring a {{convert|28|acre|m2|sing=on}} parcel of land. In 1970, Allergan became publicly traded and achieved $10 million in sales. In 1978, the company started manufacturing in Ireland. In 1980, subsidiaries were established in 30 countries, and products were marketed in more than 100 countries; sales reached $100 million. In 1980, Allergan was acquired by [[SmithKline Beecham]] (then known as "SmithKline Corporation" and herein "SmithKline"). Allergan operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of SmithKline from 1980 until 1989. In 1989, Allergan again became a stand-alone public company through a spin-off distribution by SmithKline. In 1992, Allergan sold its [[contact lens]] business in North and South America. In 1993, Allergan sold its contact lens business outside of the Americas. In 1994, Allergan acquired the Ioptex Research worldwide intraocular lens product line. In 1987, Allergan achieves $500 million in sales.

In 1995, Allergan achieved $1 billion in sales. In 1995, Allergan completed four acquisitions. In January 1995, Allergan acquired Optical Micro Systems, Inc., a U.S.-based developer and manufacturer of phacoemulsification surgical equipment. In June 1995, Allergan acquired Laboratorios Frumtost, S.A., a manufacturer of ophthalmic and other pharmaceutical products in Brazil. In August 1995, Allergan purchased the assets of Herald Pharmacal, Inc., a U.S.-based developer and manufacturer of glycolic acid-based, aesthetic skin care products. In November 1995, Allergan purchased the worldwide contact lens care product business of Pilkington Barnes Hind. Also in 1995, Allergan acquired 100% ownership interest in Santen-Allergan, its Japanese contact lens care joint venture. In 1998 The Allergan Inc established the Allergan Foundation which is a charitable foundation with the mission to make a positive and lasting impact on the community. This foundation philanthropic support and involvement to organizations who make the lives of individuals healthier and happier. This foundation focuses on supporting arts, civic programs, education and health as well as human services.  In 1999, Allergan implemented a two-for-one [[stock split]] effected as a dividend to stockholders of record on November 18, 1999.

In 2002, Botox was born. In 2004, Allergan achieved $2 billion in sales. In 2006, Allergan Achieved $3 billion in sales; Lap Band was born. In 2006, in March, Allergan acquired aesthetic company, [[Inamed]], to create a world leading aesthetic [[brand]] focused on facial [[aesthetics]], breast aesthetics, and devices designed to treat [[obesity]] (lapband). In 2007, Breast implants developed (see "Inamed acquisition" below). In 2007, in February, Allergan acquired the [[Swiss]] company Endoart SA based on the [[EPFL]] campus for its expertise in the field of telemetrically-controlled [[Implant (medicine)|implants]]. However, in the lack of a marketable product, Allergan has closed this startup in 2011.

In 2007, in November, Allergan was reported to be investigating the cosmetic properties of [[Lumigan]] in clinical trials.<ref name=WSJ-19-11-2007>Wall Street Journal: [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119543055372597359.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Drug That Lengthens Eyelashes Sets Off Flutter] ''RHONDA L.
