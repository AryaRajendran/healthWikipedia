::''This article is about policies, plans and strategies across the health care sector. For specific information on health insurance policies, see [[health insurance]].''

'''Health policy''' can be defined as the "decisions, plans, and actions that are undertaken to achieve specific [[health care]] goals within a society."<ref name="WHO-HP">World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/health_policy/en/ ''Health Policy''], accessed 22 March 2011.</ref> According to the [[World Health Organization]], an explicit health policy can achieve several things: it defines a vision for the future; it outlines priorities and the expected roles of different groups; and it builds consensus and informs people.<ref name="WHO-HP"/>

There are many categories of health policies, including personal health care policy, [[pharmaceutical policy]], and policies related to [[public health]] such as [[vaccination policy]], [[Tobacco smoking#Public policy|tobacco control policy]] or [[breastfeeding promotion]] policy. They may cover topics of financing and delivery of health care, access to care, quality of care, and [[health equity]].<ref>Harvard School of Public Health, Department of Health Policy and Management [http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/about ''About Health Care Policy''], accessed 25 March 2011.</ref>

There are also many topics in the [[politics]] and [[evidence]] that can influence the decision of a government, private sector business or other group to adopt a specific policy. [[Evidence-based policy]] relies on the use of science and rigorous studies such as [[randomized controlled trial]]s to identify programs and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes. Most political debates surround personal health care policies, especially those that seek to [[health care reform|reform health care delivery]], and can typically be categorized as either [[philosophy|philosophical]] or [[economics|economic]]. Philosophical debates center around questions about [[individual rights]], ethics and government authority, while economic topics include how to maximize the efficiency of health care delivery and minimize costs.

The modern concept of health care involves access to [[health care provider|medical professionals]] from various fields as well as [[medical technology]], such as [[medication]]s and [[surgical instrument|surgical equipment]]. It also involves access to the latest information and evidence from research, including [[medical research]] and [[health services research]].

In many countries it is left to the individual to gain access to health care goods and services by paying for them directly as [[out-of-pocket expenses]], and to private sector players in the medical and [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] industries to develop research. Planning and production of [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] is distributed among labour market participants.

Other countries have an explicit policy to ensure and support access for all of its citizens, to fund health research, and to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of health workers to meet health care goals. Many governments around the world have established [[universal health care]], which takes the burden of health care expenses off of private businesses or individuals through pooling of financial risk.  There are a variety of arguments for and against universal health care and related health policies. Health care is an important part of [[health systems]] and therefore it often accounts for one of the largest areas of spending for both [[government]]s and individuals all over the world.

=== Philosophy: right to health ===
{{See also|Philosophy of healthcare}}

Many countries and jurisdictions integrate a [[human rights]] philosophy in directing their health care policies. The [[World Health Organization]] reports that every country in the world is party to at least one human rights [[treaty]] that addresses health-related rights, including the [[right to health]] as well as other rights that relate to conditions necessary for good health.<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/hhr/en/ ''Health and Human Rights''.] Geneva. Accessed 27 May 2011.</ref> The [[United Nations]]' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) asserts that medical care is a [[right]] of all people:<ref>United Nations. [http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml ''The Universal Declaration of Human Rights''.] Adopted on December 10, 1948 by the General Assembly of the United Nations.</ref>
* ''[[UDHR]] Article 25:'' "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the [[health]] and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, [[illness|sickness]], [[disability]], widowhood, [[old age]] or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control."

In some jurisdictions and among different [[faith-based]] organizations, health policies are influenced by the perceived obligation shaped by religious beliefs to care for those in less favorable circumstances, including the sick. Other jurisdictions and [[non-governmental organization]]s draw on the principles of [[humanism]] in defining their health policies, asserting the same perceived obligation and enshrined [[right to health]].<ref name="NHCHC">National Health Care for the Homeless Council.[http://www.nhchc.org/humanright.html "Human Rights, Homelessness and Health Care."]</ref><ref name="CESR">Center for Economic and Social Rights. [http://cesr.org/ushealthright "The Right to Health in the United States of America: What Does it Mean?"] October 29, 2004.</ref> In recent years, the worldwide human rights organization [[Amnesty International]] has focused on [[health]] as a human right, addressing inadequate access to [[HIV]] drugs and women's [[reproductive health|sexual and reproductive]] rights including wide disparities in [[maternal mortality]] within and across countries. Such increasing attention to health as a basic human right has been welcomed by the leading medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Half a century of Amnesty International |journal=Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9780 |pages=1808 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21621708 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60768-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(11)60768-X}}</ref>

There remains considerable controversy regarding policies on who would be paying the costs of medical care for all people and under what circumstances. For example, government spending on health care is sometimes used as a global indicator of a government's commitment to the health of its people.<ref name="LANCET">{{cite journal |author=Lu C, Schneider MT, Gubbins P, Leach-Kemon K, Jamison D, Murray CJ |title=Public financing of health in developing countries: a cross-national systematic analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9723 |pages=1375–87 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20381856 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60233-4 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(10)60233-4}}</ref> On the other hand, one school of thought emerging from the United States rejects the notion of health care financing through taxpayer funding as incompatible with the (considered no less important) right of the physician's professional judgment, and the related concerns that government involvement in overseeing the health of its citizens could erode the [[right to privacy]] between doctors and patients. The argument furthers that universal health insurance denies the right of individual patients to dispose of their own income as per their own will.<ref name="Sade">Sade RM. "Medical care as a right: a refutation." ''N Engl J Med.'' 1971 Dec 2;285(23):1288-92. PMID 5113728. (Reprinted as [http://www.aapsonline.org/brochures/sademcr.htm "The Political Fallacy that Medical Care is a Right."])</ref><ref>The Cato Institute. [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3057 ''Universal Health Care Won't Work — Witness Medicare.'']</ref> 

Another issue in the rights debate is governments' use of legislation to control competition among private medical insurance providers against national [[social insurance]] systems, such as the case in [[Canada's national health insurance program]]. [[Laissez-faire]] supporters argue that this erodes the [[cost-effectiveness]] of the health system, as even those who can afford to pay for private health care services drain resources from the public system.<ref>Tanner MD. [http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/08/23/revolt-against-canadian-health-care-system-continues/ ''Revolt Against Canadian Health Care System Continues''.] "Cato-at-liberty" — The Cato Institute, August 2006.</ref> The issue here is whether investor-owned medical insurance companies or [[health maintenance organization]]s are in a better position to act in the best interests of their customers compared to government regulation and oversight. Another claim in the United States perceives government over-regulation of the health care and insurance industries as the effective end of charitable home visits from doctors among the poor and elderly.<ref name="David E.

=== Economics: health care financing===
Many types of health policies exist focusing on the financing of health care services to spread the economic risks of ill health. These include [[publicly funded health care]] (through taxation or insurance, also known as single-payer systems), mandatory or voluntary private [[health insurance]], and complete [[rights issue|capitalization]] of personal health care services through private companies, among others.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kereiakes DJ, Willerson JT |title=US health care: entitlement or privilege? |journal=Circulation |volume=109 |issue=12 |pages=1460–2 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15051650 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000124795.36864.78 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/109/12/1460}}</ref><ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/health_financing/en/ ''Health financing policy''.] Geneva. Accessed 27 May 2011.</ref> The debate is ongoing on which type of health financing policy results in better or worse quality of health care services provided, and how to ensure allocated funds are used effectively, efficiently and [[health equity|equitably]].

There are many arguments on both sides of the issue of public versus private health financing policies:

'''''Claims that publicly funded health care improves the quality and efficiency of personal health care delivery:'''''
* Government spending on health is essential for the accessibility and sustainability of health care services and programmes.<ref name="LANCET"/>
* For those people who would otherwise go without care due to lack of financial means, any quality care is an improvement.
* Since people perceive universal health care as ''free'' (if there is no insurance premium or co-payment), they are more likely to seek [[preventive care]] which may reduce the disease burden and overall health care costs in the long run.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
* Single-payer systems reduce wastefulness by removing the middle man, i.e. private insurance companies, thus reducing the amount of bureaucracy.<ref>William F May. [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=106 "The Ethical Foundations of Health Care Reform."] ''The Christian Century'', June 1–8, 1994, pp. 572-576.</ref> In particular, reducing the amount of paperwork that medical professionals have to deal with for insurance claims processing allows them to concentrate more on treating [[patient]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

'''''Claims that privately funded health care leads to greater quality and efficiences in personal health care:'''''
* Perceptions that publicly funded health care is ''free'' can lead to overuse of medical services, and hence raise overall costs compared to private health financing.<ref>

* Privately funded medicine leads to greater quality and efficiencies through increased access to and reduced waiting times for specialized health care services and technologies.<ref name="Sade"/><ref name="Goodman">Goodman, John.

''The Machinery of Freedom.'' Arlington House Publishers: New York, 1978. p 65-69.</ref>
* Limiting the allocation of public funds for personal health care does not curtail the ability of uninsured citizens to pay for their health care as [[out-of-pocket expenses]]. Public funds can be better rationalized to provide [[emergency care]] services regardless of insured status or ability to pay, such as with the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
* Privately funded and operated health care reduces the requirement for governments to increase taxes to cover health care costs, which may be compounded by the inefficiencies among government agencies due to their greater bureaucracy.<ref name="Goodman"/><ref>The Cato Institute.

== Other health policy options ==
Health policy options extend beyond the financing and delivery of personal health care, to domains such as [[medical research]] and [[health workforce]] planning, both domestically and internationally.

=== Medical research policy ===
[[Medical research]] can be both the basis for defining evidence-based health policy, and the subject of health policy itself, particularly in terms of its sources of funding. Those in favor of government policies for publicly funded medical research posit that removing profit as a motive will increase the rate of medical [[innovation]].<ref>For example, the recent discovery that dichloroacetate (DCA) can cause regression in several cancers, including lung, breast and brain tumors.[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/01/17/cancer-chemo.html Alberta scientists test chemotherapy alternative Last Updated: Wednesday, January 17, 2007]  The DCA compound is not patented or owned by any pharmaceutical company, and, therefore, would likely be an inexpensive drug to administer, Michelakis added.  The bad news, is that while DCA is not patented, Michelakis is concerned that it may be difficult to find funding from private investors to test DCA in clinical trials.[http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=8153 University of Alberta — Small molecule offers big hope against cancer. January 16, 2007]</ref>  Those opposed argue that it will do the opposite, because removing the incentive of profit removes incentives to innovate and inhibits new technologies from being developed and utilized.<ref name="Friedman"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Miller RL, DK Benjamin, DC North |title=The Economics of Public Issues |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2003 |isbn=0321118731 |edition=13th}}</ref>

The existence of sound medical research does not necessarily lead to evidence-based policymaking. For example, in South Africa, whose population sets the record for [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|HIV infections]], previous government policy limiting funding and access for AIDS treatments met with strong controversy given its basis on a refusal to accept scientific evidence on the means of transmission.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm "Controversy dogs Aids forum."] ''BBC News'', 10 July 2000.</ref> A change of government eventually led to a change in policy, with new policies implemented for widespread access to HIV services.<ref>[http://www.avert.org/aidssouthafrica.htm "HIV and AIDS in South Africa."] ''Avert''. Accessed 23 June 2011.</ref> Another issue relates to [[intellectual property]], as illustrated by the case of Brazil, where debates have arisen over government policy authorizing the domestic manufacture of [[antiretroviral drug]]s used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS in violation of [[HIV/AIDS in Brazil#Drug patents|drug patents]].

=== Health workforce policy ===
{{Main|Health workforce}}
Some countries and jurisdictions have an explicit policy or strategy to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] to meet health care goals, such as to address [[physician supply|physician]] and [[nursing shortage]]s. Elsewhere, health workforce planning is distributed among labour market participants as a [[laissez-faire]] approach to health policy. Evidence-based policies for health workforce development are typically based on findings from [[health services research]].

=== Health in foreign policy ===
Many governments and agencies include a health dimension in their [[foreign policy]] in order to achieve [[global health]] goals. Promoting health in lower income countries has been seen as instrumental to achieve other goals on the global agenda, including:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kickbusch I |title=Global health diplomacy: how foreign policy can influence health |journal=BMJ |volume=342 |issue= |pages=d3154 |year=2011 |pmid=21665931 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=21665931}}</ref> 
* Promoting [[global security]] — linked to fears of global [[pandemic]]s, the intentional spread of [[pathogen]]s, and a potential increase in humanitarian conflicts, natural disasters, and emergencies;
* Promoting [[economic development]] — including addressing the economic effect of poor health on development, of pandemic outbreaks on the global market place, and also the gain from the growing global market in health goods and services;
* Promoting [[social justice]] — reinforcing health as a social value and human right, including supporting the United Nations' [[Millennium Development Goals]].

=== Global health policy ===
Global health policy encompasses the global governance structures that create the policies underlying public health throughout the world. In addressing [[global health]], global health policy "implies consideration of the health needs of the people of the whole planet above the concerns of particular nations."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brown TM, Cueto M, Fee E |title=The World Health Organization and the transition from "international" to "global" public health |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=62–72 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16322464 |pmc=1470434 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.050831 |url=http://www.ajph.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2004.050831?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref>  Distinguished from both international health policy (agreements among sovereign states) and comparative health policy (analysis of health policy across states), global health policy institutions consist of the actors and norms that frame the global health response.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Szlezák NA, Bloom BR, Jamison DT, ''et al.'' |title=The global health system: actors, norms, and expectations in transition |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=e1000183 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20052277 |pmc=2796301 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000183 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000183}}</ref>
