The goal of '''evolutionary medicine''' (also known as '''Darwinian medicine''') is to understand why we get sick, not simply how we get sick.  Modern medical research and practice has focused on the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying health and disease, while evolutionary medicine focuses on the question of why evolution has shaped these mechanisms in ways that may leave us susceptible to disease.  The evolutionary approach has driven important advances in our understanding of [[antibiotic resistance]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=Carl|coauthors=et al.|journal=PNAS|year=2004|pmid=516561|volume=25|issue=11|title=[Antigens in the blood serum in pancreatic cancer]|pages=28–31}}</ref> [[cancer]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Merlo|first=LMF|coauthors=et al.|journal=Nature Reviews Cancer|year=2006|pmid=17109012}}</ref> [[autoimmune disease]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Elliott|first=DE|coauthors=JV Weinstock|title=Helminth-host immunological interactions: prevention and control of immune-mediated diseases|journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci|year=2012|pmid=22239614|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06292.x|volume=1247|pages=83–96}}</ref> and [[anatomy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Shubin|first=Neil|title=Your inner fish : a journey into the 3.5-billion-year history of the human body|year=2008|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=9780375424472|edition=1st ed.}}</ref> Medical schools have been slower to integrate evolutionary approaches because of limitations on what can be added to existing medical curricula.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/11/12/0906224106|last=Nesse|year=2009|publisher=PNAS|doi=10.1073/pnas.0906224106|pmid=19918069|first1=RM|last2=Bergstrom|first2=CT|last3=Ellison|first3=PT|last4=Flier|first4=JS|last5=Gluckman|series=107|first5=P|last6=Govindaraju|first6=DR|last7=Niethammer|first7=D|last8=Omenn|first8=GS|last9=Perlman|first9=RL|title=Making evolutionary biology a basic science for medicine|volume=Suppl 1|issue=suppl_1|pages=1800–7|pmc=2868284|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|display-authors=1 }}</ref>

=Key concepts=
* [[Trade-off]]s: changes that could make an organism less vulnerable to disease can lead to a decrease in fitness due to effects on other traits.
* [[Pathogens]] evolve rapidly and respond quickly to human intervention.
* Some symptoms are useful defenses.
* Because cultural and demographic changes are more rapid than biological evolution, humans are often [[lifestyle disease|mismatched to modern environments]].
* Human [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic history]] leaves a legacy of biological constraint.
* [[Cancer]] is the result of [[somatic evolution in cancer|somatic evolution]].
* Humans have not stopped [[human evolution|evolving]].
* All [[phenotype]]s are products of [[gene-environment interaction]] and are often shaped by developmental calibration.

Important researchers in evolutionary medicine include: [[Randolph M. Nesse]], [[George C. Williams]], [[Paul W. Ewald]], [[Stephen C. Stearns]], Carlo Maley, Andrew Read, Peter Ellison, Peter Gluckman, James McKenna, Paul W. Turke and Rainer H. Straub.

==Trade-offs==
[[Trade-off]]s are pervasive in human [[physiology]].  The evolutionary perspective on tradeoffs starts with the notion that changes in physiology that could reduce disease susceptibility might also lead to a decrease in [[fitness|fitness (biology)]] due to effects on other [[traits|Phenotypic trait]].  This can be due limited resources or simply to constraints on physiological capacities.

For instance, take the [[Radius (bone)]]; the bone's shape and density has been shaped by natural selection for an optimal balance between strength, function, and cost of development and maintenance. It is relatively common for humans to break their distal radius from a fall. It is called a [[Colles' fracture]]. Evolutionary medicine helps us understand ''why'' don't we have a thicker bone that would be more resistant to this type of fracture. Our remarkable dexterity appears to come at a cost of increased risk of this type of fracture.

As another example, the capacity to repair and [[regenerate|Regeneration (biology)]] enables us to respond to damage, but leave us susceptible to developing cancer. [[Inflammation]] is critical for response to injury. Chronic inflammation arises in settings of repeated damage. Chronic inflammation of the liver, also known as chronic [[hepatatis]], is a major risk factor for [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Beasley|first=R.Palmer|coauthors=Lin, Chia-Chin; Hwang, Lu-Yu; Chien, Chia-Siang|title=HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA AND HEPATITIS B VIRUS|journal=The Lancet|date=1 November 1981|volume=318|issue=8256|pages=1129–1133|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(81)90585-7}}</ref>

=History=
[[Image:Annie Darwin.jpg|right|thumb|182px| [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin’s]] daughter [[Anne Darwin|Anne]], “the joy of the household” died aged 10 due to [[tuberculosis]]. ]]
[[Charles Darwin]] did not discuss the implications of his work for medicine, though [[biology|biologists]] quickly appreciated in the [[germ theory of disease]] its implications for understanding the evolution of [[pathogen]]s, and an organism’s need to defend against them.

Medicine, in turn, ignored evolution, and instead focused (as done in the [[hard science]]s) upon [[Mechanism (biology)|proximate mechanical causes]].
<blockquote>medicine has modelled itself after a mechanical physics, deriving from Galileo, Newton, and Descartes.... As a result of assuming this model, medicine is mechanistic, materialistic, reductionistic, linear-causal, and deterministic (capable of precise predictions) in its concepts. It seeks explanations for diseases, or their symptoms, signs, and cause in single, materialistic— i.e., anatomical or structural (e.g., in genes and their products)— changes within the body, wrought directly (linearly), for example, by infectious, toxic, or traumatic agents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weiner H |title=Notes on an evolutionary medicine |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=510–20 |pmid=9710299 |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9710299 |date = 1 July 1998}}</ref> <sup>p. 510</sup></blockquote>

An important theoretical development was [[Nikolaas Tinbergen|Nikolaas Tinbergen’s]] distinction made originally in [[ethology]] between [[Tinbergen's four questions|evolutionary and proximate mechanisms]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x |author=Tinbergen N |title=On Aims and Methods in Ethology |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=410–433 |year=1963 |url=http://www.rockefeller.edu/bard/pdfs/week_02_tinbergen_on_aims_and_methods_of_ethology_zft_1963.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

Randolph Nesse summarizes its relevance to medicine: <blockquote>all biological traits need two kinds of explanation, both proximate and evolutionary. The proximate explanation for a disease describes what is wrong in the bodily mechanism of individuals affected by it. An evolutionary explanation is completely different. Instead of explaining why people are different, it explains why we are all the same in ways that leave us vulnerable to disease. Why do we all have wisdom teeth, an appendix, and cells that can divide out of control?<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nesse RM |title=Evolution: medicine's most basic science |journal=Lancet |volume=372 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S21–7 |month=December |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61877-2 }}</ref></blockquote>

=Current Activity in the Field=
Evolutionary medicine as a field began in the early 1990s, but has grown dramatically in recent years.  These developments include the creation of the online publication [http://www.evmedreview.com The Evolution & Medicine Review] which has served as a clearinghouse for important information in the field, two peer-reviewed journals ([http://www.emph.oxfordjournals.org Evolution, Medicine and Public Health] and [http://www.ashdin.com/journals/jem/jem.aspx Journal of Evolutionary Medicine]), the founding of two evolution and cancer centers ([http://cancer.ucsf.edu/evolution The Center for Evolution and Cancer at UCSF] and [http://www.darevcan.univ-montp2.fr/?page_id=79 The Darwinian Evolution of Cancer Consortium in Montpellier]) and [http://www.cidd.psu.edu/ The Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Penn State].  There is now a national working group on evolutionary medicine education at the NSF sponsored National Evolutionary Synthesis Center, [http://www.nescent.org/science/awards_summary.php?id=315 Infusing Medical Education with Evolutionary Thinking].  Evolutionary Medicine programs have been established at a growing number of Universities, including [http://www.evmed.ucla.edu/emm.php UCLA], [http://www.biodesign.asu.edu/research/projects/evolutionary-medicine Arizona State University] and [https://www.dur.ac.uk/ev.med/ Durham University] in the UK.

==Pathogens==
The adaptive evolution of bacteria, viruses, other microbes and parasites plays a central role in medicine since this process is needed to understand issues such as antibiotic resistance,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stearns SC, Ebert D |title=Evolution in health and disease: work in progress |journal=Q Rev Biol |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=417–32 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11783396 |doi=10.1086/420539 }}</ref>  pathogen virulence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wickham ME, Brown NF, Boyle EC, Coombes BK, Finlay BB |title=Virulence is positively selected by transmission success between mammalian hosts |journal=Curr.

===Antibiotic resistance===
Microorganisms evolve resistance through natural selection acting upon random mutation. Once a gene conferring resistance arises to counteract an antibiotic, not only can that bacteria thrive, but it can spread that gene to other types of bacteria through  [[horizontal gene transfer]] of genetic information by [[Bacterial conjugation|plasmid exchange]].

''For more details on this topic, see'' [[antibiotic resistance]]

===Virulence===
The effect of organisms upon their [[Host (biology)|host]] can vary from being [[symbiotic]] [[commensals]] that are beneficial, to pathogens that reduce fitness. Many pathogens produce [[virulence factors]] that directly cause disease, or manipulate their host to allow them to thrive and spread. Since a pathogen’s fitness is determined by its success in transmitting offspring to other hosts, it was thought at one time, that virulence moderated and it evolved toward commensality. However, this view is now questioned by [[Evolution of Infectious Disease|Ewald]].

''For more details on this topic, see'' [[virulence]], [[virulence factor]]s and [[optimal virulence]]

===Immune evasion===
The success of any pathogen depends upon its ability to evade host immunity. Therefore, pathogens evolve methods that enable them to infect a host, and then evade detection and destruction by its immune system. These include hiding within host cells, within a protective capsule (as with [[Immune_system#Manipulation_by_pathogens|''M. tuberculosis'']]), secreting compounds that misdirect the host's immune response, binding its antibodies, rapidly changing surface markers, or masking them with the host’s own molecules.

==Human adaptations==
Adaptation works within constraints, makes compromises and tradeoffs, and occurs in the context of different forms of competition.<ref name=Stearns05>{{cite journal |author=Stearns SC |title=Issues in evolutionary medicine |journal=Am. J. Hum. Biol. |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=131–40 |year=2005 |pmid=15736177 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.20105 }}</ref>

===Constraints===
Adaptations can only occur if they are [[Evolvability|evolvable]]. Some adaptations which would prevent ill health are therefore not possible.
* [[DNA]] cannot be totally prevented from undergoing somatic replication [[mutation|corruption]]; this means that [[cancer]], which is caused by somatic mutations, can never be completely eliminated by natural selection.
* Humans cannot [[Biosynthesis|biosynthesize]] [[Vitamin C]], and so risk [[scurvy]], Vitamin C deficiency disease, if dietary intake of the vitamin is insufficient.
* [[Ganglion cell layer|Retinal neurons]] and their axon output have evolved to be inside the layer of [[Photoreceptor cell|retinal pigment cells]]. This creates a constraint on the evolution of the visual system such that the [[optic nerve]] is forced to exit the retina through a point called the [[optic disc]]. This in turn creates a [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]]. More importantly, it makes vision vulnerable to [[Intraocular pressure|increased pressure within the eye]] ([[glaucoma]]) since this [[Cup-to-disc ratio|cups]] and damages the optic nerve at this point, resulting in impaired vision.
Other constraints occur as the byproduct of adaptive innovations.

===Trade-offs and conflicts===
One constraint upon selection is that different adaptations can conflict, which requires a compromise between them to ensure an optimal cost-benefit tradeoff.

* Expulsions: [[sneezing]], [[vomiting]], [[coughing]], [[diarrhea]]

;Management
Evolved defense mechanisms can be costly, due to increased energy use ([[Deployment_cost-benefit_selection_in_physiology#Fever|fever increases BMR by 10-15%]] for each degree rise in body temperature), and due to the risk of damaging the body (vomiting can risk [[Vomiting#Complications|aspiration]]). A [[biological fitness|fitness]] advantage therefore exists in deploying defense mechanisms selectively only when the potential benefits outweigh such costs. Their  deployment is controlled at several levels, including through biomolecular pathways using factors such as [[proinflammatory cytokine]]s, and through higher [[Neural top down control of physiology|neural top down]] processes in [[Neural_top_down_control_of_physiology#Cerebral_cortex|cerebral cortex]] areas such as the [[insular cortex]]. Neural control provides advantages in that deployment can be based on tradeoffs between costs and benefits that take into account relevant health circumstances. This evolved regulation functions as a [[health management system]].<ref name="Great">{{cite book |author=Humphrey, Nicholas |chapter=19.

===Cleanliness===
{{See also|Autoimmune disease|Allergy#Hygiene hypothesis|Hygiene hypothesis|Helminthic therapy}}
Contemporary humans - due to medical treatment, frequent washing of clothing and the body, and improved sanitation - are mostly free of [[List of parasites (human)|parasites]], particularly [[Intestinal parasite|intestinal ones]]. This causes problems in the proper development of the immune system.

==Evolutionary psychiatry / Clinical evolutionary psychology==

As noted in the table below, adaptationist hypotheses regarding the etiology of psychological disorders are often based on analogies with evolutionary perspectives on medicine and physiological dysfunctions (see in particular, [[Randolph M. Nesse|Randy Nesse]] and [[George C. Williams]]' book ''[http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Sick-Darwinian/dp/0679746749/ Why We Get Sick]'').<ref>Nesse, R., & Williams, G. (1996) Why We Get Sick.
