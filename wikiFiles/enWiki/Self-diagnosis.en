'''Self-diagnosis''' is the process of [[diagnosis|diagnosing]], or identifying, medical conditions in oneself.  It may be assisted by medical dictionaries, books, resources on the Internet, past personal experiences, or recognizing [[symptoms]] or [[medical sign]]s of a condition that a family member previously had. 

Self-diagnosis is prone to error and may be potentially dangerous if inappropriate decisions are made on the basis of a misdiagnosis.<ref name="titleHealth information on the Internet - Better Health Channel.">{{cite web |url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/(Pages)/Health_information_on_the_Internet?OpenDocument |title=Health information on the Internet - Better Health Channel. |accessdate=2008-03-23 |format= |work=}}</ref>  Because of the risks, self-diagnosis is officially discouraged by governments,<ref name="titleHealth information on the Internet - Better Health Channel."/> physicians, and patient care organizations.  Even physicians are discouraged from engaging in self-diagnosis,<ref name="titleAHRQ WebM&M: Case & Commentary">{{cite web |url=http://www.webmm.ahrq.gov/case.aspx?caseID=71&searchStr=saline |title=AHRQ WebM&M: Case & Commentary |accessdate=2008-03-23 |format= |work=}}</ref> because doctors also make mistakes in diagnosing themselves.<ref name="titleA case of self-diagnosis.">{{cite web |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1602738 |title=A case of self-diagnosis. |accessdate=2008-03-23 |format= |work=}}</ref>  If the self-diagnosis is wrong, then the misdiagnosis can result in improper health care, including wrong treatments and lack of care for serious conditions.<ref name="titleCRICO/RMF - Case Studies - High Risk Areas - Diagnosis - Reliance on Patient’s Self Diagnosis Obscures Fatal Condition">{{cite web |url=http://www.rmf.harvard.edu/case-studies/high-risk-areas/diagnosis/reliance-on-patients-self-diagnosis-obscures-fatal-condition.aspx |title=CRICO/RMF - Case Studies - High Risk Areas - Diagnosis - Reliance on Patient’s Self Diagnosis Obscures Fatal Condition |accessdate=2008-03-23 |format= |work=}}</ref>

However, self-diagnosis may be appropriate under certain circumstances.<ref name="isbn0-471-98655-0">{{cite book |author=Peter D. Stonier; Fletcher, Andrew; Lionel D.

Some conditions are more likely to be self-diagnosed, especially simple conditions such as [[head lice]] and skin [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] or familiar conditions such as [[menstrual cramps]], [[headache]] or the [[common cold]].  

Complex conditions for which medications are heavily advertised, including conditions like [[ADHD]] in adults,<ref name="isbn0-8018-8585-X">{{cite book |author=Conrad, Peter |title=The Medicalization of Society: On the Transformation of Human Conditions into Treatable Disorders |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2007 |isbn=0-8018-8585-X |page=59}}</ref> present a more challenging situation.
