'''Endometrial hyperplasia''' is a condition of excessive proliferation of the cells of the [[endometrium]], or inner lining of the [[uterus]]. 

Most cases of endometrial hyperplasia result from high levels of [[estrogen]]s, combined with insufficient levels of the [[progestagen|progesterone-like]] hormones which ordinarily counteract estrogen's proliferative effects on this tissue. This may occur in a number of settings, including obesity, [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], estrogen producing tumours (e.g. [[granulosa cell tumour]]) and certain formulations of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|estrogen replacement therapy]]. Endometrial hyperplasia is a significant risk factor for the development or even co-existence of [[endometrial cancer]], so careful monitoring and treatment of women with this disorder is essential.

==Classification==
Like other [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]] disorders, endometrial hyperplasia initially represents a [[physiology|physiological]] response of endometrial tissue to the growth-promoting actions of [[estrogen]]. However, the gland-forming cells of a hyperplastic endometrium may also undergo changes over time which predispose them to [[cancer]]ous transformation. Several [[microscopic|histopathology]] subtypes of endometrial hyperplasia are recognisable to the [[pathology|pathologist]], with different therapeutic and [[prognosis|prognostic]] implications.<ref name="Weidner's">{{cite book |author=Richard Cote, Saul Suster, Lawrence Weiss, Noel Weidner (Editor) |title=Modern Surgical Pathology (2 Volume Set) |publisher=W B Saunders |location=London |year= 2002|pages= |isbn=0-7216-7253-1 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

*Endometrial hyperplasia (simple or complex) - Irregularity and cystic expansion of glands (simple) or crowding and budding of glands (complex) without worrisome changes in the appearance of individual gland cells. In one study, 1.6% of patients diagnosed with these abnormalities eventually developed endometrial cancer.<ref name="Kurman">{{cite journal |author=Kurman RJ, Kaminski PF, Norris HJ |title=The behavior of endometrial hyperplasia.

*Atypical endometrial hyperplasia (simple or complex) - Simple or complex architectural changes, with worrisome (''atypical'') changes in gland cells, including cell stratification, tufting, loss of nuclear polarity, enlarged nuclei, and an increase in [[mitosis|mitotic activity]]. These changes are similar to those seen in true cancer cells, but atypical hyperplasia does not show invasion into the connective tissues, the defining characteristic of cancer. The previously mentioned study found that 22% of patients with atypical hyperplasia eventually developed cancer.<ref name="Kurman" />

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia can be made by endometrial biopsy which is done in the office setting or through [[curettage]] of the uterine cavity to obtain endometrial tissue for histopathologic analysis. A workup for endometrial disease may be prompted by abnormal uterine bleeding, or the presence of atypical glandular cells on a [[pap smear]].<ref name="UTDOL-EH">{{Cite document|url=http://www.uptodateonline.com/utd/content/topic.do?topicKey=gen_gyne/13384&type=A&selectedTitle=1~22|author=Howard A Zacur, Robert L Giuntoli, II, Marcus Jurema|title=Endometrial Hyperplasia|publisher=UpToDate Online (subscription required)|accessdate=2007-05-26|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment of endometrial hyperplasia is individualized, and may include [[hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]], such as cyclic or continuous [[progestin]] therapy, or [[hysterectomy]].<ref name="UTDOL-EH"/>
