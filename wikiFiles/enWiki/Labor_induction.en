'''Labor induction''' is a method of artificially or prematurely stimulating [[childbirth]] in a woman.<ref>Houghton Mifflin Company, (2006): The American Heritage Dictionary.</ref>

==Indications==
Common suggested reasons for induction include:
* [[Postterm pregnancy]], i.e. if the pregnancy has gone past the 42 week mark.
* [[Intrauterine fetal growth retardation]] (IUGR).
* There are health risks to the woman in continuing the pregnancy (e.g. she has [[pre-eclampsia]]).
* [[Premature rupture of the membranes]] (PROM); this is when the membranes have ruptured, but labor does not start within a specific amount of time.<ref>Allahyar,J. & Galan, H. "Premature Rupture of the Membranes."; also American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists.</ref>
* Premature termination of the pregnancy (abortion).
* Scheduling concerns.
* Fetal death in utero.
* Twin pregnancy continuing beyond 38 weeks.

== Methods of induction ==
Methods of inducing labor include medication and processes.

===Medication===
* [[Intravaginal administration|Intravaginal]], [[endocervical administration|endocervical]] or [[extra-amniotic administration]] of [[prostaglandin]], such as [[dinoprostone]] or [[misoprostol]].<ref name="pmid15043790">{{cite journal |author=Li XM, Wan J, Xu CF, Zhang Y, Fang L, Shi ZJ, Li K |title=Misoprostol in labor induction of term pregnancy: a meta-analysis|journal=Chin Med J (Engl)|volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=449–52 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15043790 |doi=}}</ref> In the few controlled trials that have been done, extra-amniotic administration appears to be more efficient than intravaginal or endocervical administration of prostaglandins in labor induction, with no differential effects on other outcome measures.<ref>''A Guide to Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth''. Murray Enkin, Marc J.N.C. Keirse, James Neilson, Caroline Crowther, Lelia Duley, Ellen Hodnett and Justus Hofmeyr. (Oxford University Press, 2000)</ref>
* [[Intravenous]] administration of synthetic [[oxytocin]] preparations, such as [[Pitocin]].
* Use of [[mifepristone]] has been described.<ref name="pmid16647925">{{cite journal |author=Clark K, Ji H, Feltovich H, Janowski J, Carroll C, Chien EK |title=Mifepristone-induced cervical ripening: structural, biomechanical, and molecular events |journal=Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. |volume=194 |issue=5 |pages=1391–8 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16647925 |doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2005.11.026 |url=}}</ref>
* [[Relaxin]] has been investigated,<ref name="pmid11406079">{{cite journal |author=Kelly AJ, Kavanagh J, Thomas J |title=Relaxin for cervical ripening and induction of labor |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD003103 |year=2001 |pmid=11406079 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003103 |url=}}</ref> but is not currently commonly used.

===Processes===

* "Membrane sweep", also known as membrane stripping, or "stretch and sweep" in Australia and the UK - during an internal examination, the midwife moves her finger around the cervix to stimulate and/or separate the membranes around the baby from the cervix.  This causes a release of prostaglandins which can help to kick-start labor.
* [[Artificial rupture of the membranes]] (AROM or ARM) ("breaking the waters")
* [[Extra-amniotic saline infusion]] (EASI),<ref name=Guinn2004>{{cite pmid|15295370}}</ref> in which a [[Foley catheter]] is inserted into the [[cervix]] and the distal portion expanded to dilate it and to release prostaglandins.

== When to induce ==
Until recently, the most common practice has been to induce labor by the end of the 42nd week of gestation. This practice is still very common. In the UK, a dating scan is usually conducted around the 12th week of pregnancy to determine the estimated due date.  Research suggests that scans done after this date can cause the estimated due date to become less accurate, with the longer time that passes.  In the cases of late dating scans, the estimated due date is less accurate which could therefore provoke a woman to be induced unnecessarily.   While recent studies have shown a very slightly increased risk of infant mortality for births in 41st and particularly 42nd week of gestation, as well as a slightly higher risk of injury to the mother and child.<ref>Tim A. Bruckner et al, ''Increased neonatal mortality among normal-weight births beyond 41 weeks of gestation in California'', October 2008, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, [http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(08)00558-9/abstract]</ref> The recommended date for induction of labor has therefore been moved to the end of the 41st week of gestation in many countries including Sweden and Canada.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Inducing labor before 39 weeks increases the risk of complications and premature death, from factors including underdeveloped lungs, infection due to underdeveloped immune system, problems feeding due to underdeveloped brain, and [[jaundice]] from underdeveloped liver.  Some hospitals in the United States noticed a significant increase in [[neonatal intensive care unit]] patients when women schedule deliveries for convenience, and are taking steps to reduce induction for non-medical reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=138473097|title=Doctors To Pregnant Women: Wait At Least 39 Weeks|accessdate=2011-08-20|date=2011-07-18}}</ref>

The odds of having a vaginal delivery after labor induction are assessed by a "Bishop Score".<ref>Faulkner, J. (2008). The truth about induction. Fit Pregnancy, 15(2), 44-46. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.</ref> A Bishop Score is done to assess the progression of the cervix prior to an induction. In order to do this, the cervix must be checked to see how much it has effaced, thinned out, and how far open it is. The score goes by a points system depending on five factors. Each factor is scored on a scale between 0-3, any score that adds up to be less than 5 holds a higher risk of delivering by cesarean section.<ref>Doheny, K. (2010, June 22). Labor Induction May Boost C-Section Risk. HealthDay Consumer News Service. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.</ref>

If an induction causes complications during labor, a [[Caesarean section]] is almost always conducted. An induction is most likely to result in successful vaginal delivery when a woman is close to or in the early stages of labor. Signs of impending labor may include softening of the cervix, dilation and increasing frequency or intensity of contractions.  The [[Bishop score]] may be used to assess the advisability of induction, and is based on such factors.

== Criticisms of induction ==
Induced labor tends to be more painful for the woman.<ref>National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, "CG70 Induction of labour: NICE guideline", [http://publications.nice.org.uk/induction-of-labour-cg70/introduction] July 2008, retrieved 2012-04-10</ref> This can lead to the increased use of [[analgesic]]s and other pain-relieving pharmaceuticals.<ref>[[David Vernon (writer)|Vernon, David]], ''[[Having a Great Birth in Australia]],'' [[Australian College of Midwives]], 2005, ISBN 0-9751674-3-X</ref>  These interventions have been said to lead to an increased likelihood of [[caesarean section]] delivery for the baby.<ref>Roberts, Tracy, Peat, 2000 ''Rates for obstetric intervention among private and public patients in Australia: population based descriptive study'' Christine L Roberts, Sally Tracy, Brian Peat, "British Medical Journal", v321:140 July 2000</ref> However, studies into this matter show differing results.  One study indicated that while overall caesarean section rates from 1990-1997 remained at or below 20%, elective induction was associated with a doubling of the rate of caesarean section .<ref>Yeast, John D., ''Induction of labor and the relationship to caesarean delivery: A review of 7001 consecutive inductions.'', March 1999, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, [http://pt.wkhealth.com/pt/re/ajog/abstract.00000447-199903000-00026.htm]</ref> Two more recent studies have shown that induction may increase the risk of caesarean section if performed before the 40th week of gestation, but it has no effect or actually lowers the risk if performed after the 40th week.<ref>Caughey AB, Nicholson JM, Cheng YW, Lyell DJ, Washington E.
