'''ME Research UK''' is a [[medical research]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] based in the [[United Kingdom]] with the principal aim of commissioning and funding scientific (biomedical) investigation into the causes, consequences and treatment of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] (CFS), which in the United Kingdom is frequently referred to as ''myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)'', one of the recognised [[alternative names for chronic fatigue syndrome]]. The issue of nomenclature is highly controversial in this field of medicine,<ref>{{cite web

The organisation (charity number SC036942) was formed in 2000 under the name Myalgic Encephalomyelitis Research Group for Education and Support (MERGE),<ref>{{cite web

Ongoing research projects currently funded by ME Research UK include a Swedish study to provide an independent investigation into the link between [[xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus]] (XMRV) and CFS,<ref>{{cite web

In addition to funding research into biomedical aspects of CFS, the charity produces reviews and reports, organises and presents research at professional meetings and conferences, and was instrumental in forming a cross party group on the condition at the [[Scottish Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web

Most of its funds come from private and corporate donations, and the Friends of ME Research UK Friends scheme has been set up to support the charity and help with fundraising.
