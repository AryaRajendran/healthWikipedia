An '''E chart,''' also known as a '''tumbling E chart,''' is an [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmological]] chart used to measure a patient's visual acuity.

==Uses==

This chart is useful for patients who are unable to read the [[Latin alphabet]] - for example, very young children.  It is also used in countries where people do not use the alphabet in their native language - for example, in [[China]].

It contains rows of the letter "E" in various kinds of rotation. The patient is asked to state (usually by pointing) where the limbs of the E are pointing "up, down, left or right." Depending on how far the patient can "read", his or her visual acuity is quantified.  It works on the same principle as [[Snellen chart|Snellen's distant vision chart]].
