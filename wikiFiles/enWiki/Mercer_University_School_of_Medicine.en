'''Mercer University School of Medicine''' ('''MUSM''') is the graduate [[medical school]] of [[Mercer University]]. It was founded in [[Macon, GA]] in 1982, and as of 2008 has expanded to include an additional site in [[Savannah, GA]], with either site allowing students to complete all four requisite years of medical training.<ref name=AcademicMedicine>[http://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Fulltext/2010/09001/Mercer_University_School_of_Medicine.32.aspx] AAMC Academic Medicine.</ref>  In 2012, MUSM developed a third site in [[Columbus, GA]] at which students may elect to complete their third and fourth years of training.<ref name=MUSMWebsite>[http://medicine.mercer.edu] MUSM Website.</ref>  Mercer University School of Medicine adopts a mission that is heavily directed towards training future physicians to practice in the [[State of Georgia]], and as such, prospective matriculants must be Georgia residents.

==MD Program Curriculum==
Since its foundation in 1982, Mercer University School of Medicine has adopted a discussion based pre-clinical curriculum in lieu of the more traditional lecture format.<ref name=BMP>[http://medicine.mercer.edu/academics/programs/bmp/] Biomedical Problems Program.</ref>  This Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach to training students in the basic medical sciences focuses around small group discussions wherein students share didactic responsibilities and interact much more actively than in a standard lecture.  In this system, each PBL group meets several times a week to review relevant literature and discuss issues pertinent to the current subject matter, and although each group contains a tutor (a professor of MUSM), there is no truly identified roles of teacher and studentâ€”instead, these roles are shared by every member of the group.  Also in contrast to lecture-based programs, which generally necessitate subject exams, the PBL program makes use of multidisciplinary exams more similar in scope of content (i.e. multiple disciplines) to the USMLE board examinations.
