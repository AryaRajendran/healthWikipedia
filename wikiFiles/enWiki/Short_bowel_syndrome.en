'''Short bowel syndrome''' ('''SBS''', also '''short gut syndrome''' or simply '''short gut''') is a [[malabsorption]] disorder caused by the [[surgery|surgical]] removal of the [[small intestine]], or rarely due to the complete dysfunction of a large segment of bowel. Most cases are acquired, although some children are born with a congenital short bowel. It usually does not develop unless more than two thirds of the small intestine have been removed.  SBS has been designated a [[rare disease]] by the [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]],<ref name=orphanet104008>{{Citation

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of short bowel syndrome can include:
* [[Abdominal pain]]
* [[Diarrhea]] and [[steatorrhea]] (oily or sticky stool, which can be malodorous)
* Fluid depletion
* [[Weight loss]] and [[malnutrition]]
* [[Fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]]

Patients with short bowel syndrome may have complications caused by malabsorption of vitamins and minerals, such as deficiencies in [[vitamin]]s [[vitamin A|A]], [[vitamin D|D]], [[vitamin E|E]], [[vitamin K|K]], and [[vitamin B12|B12]], [[calcium in biology|calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[folic acid]], and [[zinc]].  These may appear as [[anemia]], [[hyperkeratosis]] (scaling of the skin), easy bruising, muscle spasms, poor blood clotting, and bone pain.

==Causes==
Short bowel syndrome in adults is usually caused by surgery for:
* [[Crohn's disease]], an inflammatory disorder of the digestive tract
* [[Volvulus]], a spontaneous twisting of the small intestine that cuts off the blood supply and leads to tissue death
* [[Tumor]]s of the small intestine
* [[Injury]] or trauma to the small intestine
* [[Necrotizing enterocolitis]] (premature newborn)
* Bypass surgery to treat obesity
* Surgery to remove diseases or damaged portion of the small intestine

==Pathophysiology==
In healthy adults, the small intestine has an average length of approximately 6 meters (19.7&nbsp;feet).  Short bowel syndrome usually develops when there is less than 2 meters (6.6&nbsp;feet) of the small intestine left to absorb sufficient [[nutrient]]s.

Short bowel syndrome caused by the surgical removal of a portion of the bowel may be a temporary condition, due to the adaptive property of the small intestine.

In a process called intestinal adaptation, physiological changes to the remaining portion of the small intestine occur to increase its absorptive capacity.  These changes include:
* Enlargement and lengthening of the [[Intestinal villus|villi]] found in the lining
* Increase in the diameter of the small intestine
* Slow down in peristalsis or movement of food through the small intestine

==Treatments==
Symptoms of short bowel syndrome are usually addressed by prescription medicine.  These include:
* Anti-diarrheal medicine (e.g. [[loperamide]], [[codeine]])
* Vitamin, mineral supplements and L-Glutamine powder mixed with water
* [[H2 blocker]] and [[proton pump inhibitor]]s to reduce stomach acid
* [[Lactase]] supplement (to improve the bloating and diarrhoea associated with [[lactose intolerance]])
* Surgery, including intestinal lengthening, tapering, and [[small bowel transplant]].
* Parenteral nutrition (PN or TPN for [[total parenteral nutrition]] - nutrition administered via intravenous line).
* Nutrition administered via [[gastrostomy tube]]

In 2004, the [[USFDA]] approved a therapy that reduces the frequency and volume of TPN, comprising:  [[NutreStore]] (oral solution of glutamine) and Zorbtive<!--term redirects to this section--> ([[growth hormone]], of [[recombinant DNA]] origin, for injection) together with a specialized oral diet.<ref name=ByrneGertner2005/>  Eight years later, in 2012, an advisory panel to the USFDA voted unanimously to approve for treatment of SBS the agent [[teduglutide]], a [[glucagon-like peptide-2]] analog developed by [[NPS Pharmaceuticals]], who intend to market the agent in the United States under the brandname Gattex.<ref name=sherman2012>{{Cite news

Surgical procedures to lengthen dilated bowel include the Bianchi procedure (where the bowel is cut in half and one end is sewn to the other) and a newer procedure called serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP—where the bowel is cut and stapled in a zigzag pattern). Heung Bae Kim, MD, and Tom Jaksic, MD, both of Children's Hospital Boston, devised the STEP procedure in the early 2000s. The procedure lengthens the bowel of children with SBS and may allow children to avoid the need for intestinal transplantation. As of June 2009, Kim and Jaksic have performed 18 STEP procedures.<ref name=STEP>{{Citation

The Bianchi and STEP procedures are usually performed by pediatric surgeons at quaternary hospitals who specialize in small bowel surgery.

==Prognosis==
There is no cure for short bowel syndrome.  In newborn infants, the 4-year survival rate on [[Total parenteral nutrition|parenteral nutrition]] is approximately 70%. In newborn infants with less than 10% of expected intestinal length, 5 year survival is approximately 20%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Spencer AU, Neaga A, West B, ''et al.'' |title=Pediatric short bowel syndrome: redefining predictors of success |journal=Ann.

Although promising, small intestine transplant has a mixed success rate, with postoperative mortality rate of up to 30%.  One-year and 4-year survival rate are 90% and 60%, respectively.
