'''Motion sickness''' or '''kinetosis''', also known as '''travel sickness''', is a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the [[vestibular system]]'s sense of movement.  Depending on the cause, it can also be referred to as [[seasickness]], car sickness, simulation sickness or [[airsickness]].<ref name=benson>{{cite book |author=Benson, AJ |title=Motion Sickness.

[[Dizziness]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and [[nausea]] are the most common [[symptom]]s of motion sickness.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080610021948/http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/907367055.html Motion Sickness Prevention and Treatment]</ref> [[Sopite syndrome]] in which a person feels fatigue or tiredness is also associated with motion sickness.

Woodhouse's English-Greek Dictionary Page 766]</ref> If the motion causing nausea is not resolved, the sufferer will usually [[vomiting|vomit]]. Unlike ordinary sickness, vomiting in motion sickness tends not to relieve the nausea.<ref name=benson/>

==Occurrence==

About 33% of people are susceptible to motion sickness even in mild circumstances such as being on a boat in calm water, although nearly 66% of people are susceptible in more severe conditions.<ref name=benson/><ref>[http://www.pctoday.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/2006/t0405/33t05/33t05.asp&guid= PC Today Article - Motion Sickness]</ref><ref>So, R.H.Y., Finney, C.M. and Goonetilleke, R.S., "Motion sickness susceptibility and occurrence in Hong Kong Chinese." Contemporary Ergonomics 1999, Taylor & Francis, pp.88-92.</ref> Individuals and animals without a functional [[vestibular system]] are immune to motion sickness.<ref name="GMO">[http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/OperationalMedicine/DATA/operationalmed/Manuals/GMOManual/clinical/Motion%20sickness.html General Medical Officer (GMO) Manual: Clinical Section: Motion Sickness<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Motion sickness on the [[sea]] can result from being in the [[Berth (sleeping)|berth]] of a rolling boat without being able to see the [[horizon]].   Sudden jerky movements tend to be worse for provoking motion sickness than slower smooth ones, because they disrupt the fluid balance more.<ref name=benson/> A "corkscrewing" boat will upset more people than one that is gliding smoothly across the oncoming waves. Cars driving rapidly around winding roads or up and down a series of hills will upset more people than cars that are moving over smooth, straight roads. Looking down into one's lap to consult a map or attempting to read a book while a passenger in a car may also bring on motion sickness.for vertical [[sinusoidal]] motion in the frequency range of 0.083-0.5&nbsp;Hz and is maximal at 0.167&nbsp;Hz.<ref>O'Hanlon JF, McCauley ME. (1974).Motion sickness incidence as a function of the frequency and acceleration of vertical sinusoidal motion. Aerosp Med. 45(4):366-9. PMID 4821729</ref>

==Cause==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
The most common hypothesis for the cause of motion sickness is that it functions as a defense mechanism against [[neurotoxin]]s.<ref name="GMO"/> The [[area postrema]] in the [[human brain|brain]] is responsible for inducing vomiting when poisons are detected, and for resolving conflicts between vision and balance. When feeling motion but not seeing it (for example, in a ship with no windows), the [[inner ear]] transmits to the brain that it senses motion, but the eyes tell the brain that everything is still. As a result of the discordance, the brain will come to the conclusion that one of them is [[hallucinating]] and further conclude that the hallucination is due to poison ingestion. The [[Human brain|brain]] responds by inducing vomiting, to clear the supposed toxin.

==Types==
Motion sickness can be divided into three categories:
# Motion sickness caused by motion that is felt but not seen
# Motion sickness caused by motion that is seen but not felt
# Motion sickness caused when both systems detect motion but they do not correspond.

===Motion is felt but not seen===
In these cases, motion is sensed by the [[vestibular system]] and hence the motion is felt, but no motion or little motion is detected by the [[visual system]].

====Carsickness or car sickness====
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
A specific form of motion sickness, car sickness is quite common and often evidenced by the inability to read a map or book during travel. Car sickness results from the sensory conflict arising in the brain from differing sensory inputs.  The eyes mostly see the interior of the car which is motionless while the vestibular system of the inner ear senses motion as the vehicle goes around corners or over hills and even small bumps.  Therefore the effect is worst when looking down but may be lessened by looking outside of the vehicle.

====Airsickness====
{{Main|Airsickness}}
''Airsickness'' is a sensation which is induced by air travel.<ref name=benson/> It is a specific form of motion sickness and is considered a normal response in healthy individuals. Airsickness occurs when the [[central nervous system]] receives conflicting messages from the body (including the [[inner ear]], [[Human eye|eye]]s and [[muscle]]s) affecting [[balance (ability)|balance]] and [[Equilibrioception|equilibrium]].  It is essentially the same as carsickness but occurs in an airplane.  However, some significant differences are that an airplane may bank and tilt sharply and due to the small window sizes, a passenger is likely to see only the stationary interior of the plane.  Another factor is that while in flight, there is little that can be seen outside of the windows that would indicate motion to the visual system.

====Sea-sickness====
{{Main|Seasickness}}
''Seasickness'' is a form of motion sickness characterized by a feeling of [[nausea]] and, in extreme cases, [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] experienced after spending time on a craft on [[water]].<ref name=benson/>  It is, again, essentially the same as carsickness, though the motion of a watercraft tends to be more constant.  It is typically brought on by the rocking motion of the craft<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gahlinger PM |title=A comparison of motion sickness remedies in severe sea conditions |journal=Wilderness Environ Med |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=136–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10921365 |doi=10.1580/1080-6032(2000)011[0136:LTTE]2.3.CO;2}}</ref> or movement while immersed in water.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Norfleet WT, Peterson RE, Hamilton RW, Olstad CS |title=Susceptibility of divers in open water to motion sickness |journal=Undersea Biomed Res |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=41–7 |year=1992 |month=January |pmid=1536062 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2621 |accessdate=2008-05-09}}</ref>  As with airsickness, it can be difficult to visually detect motion even if one looks outside of the boat as water does not offer fixed points with which to visually judge motion. Some people experience car sickness yet they don't experience seasickness. Also it tends to be worse when it's foggy.

====Centrifuges====
Rotating devices such as [[Centrifuge#Aeronautics_and_astronautics|centrifuges]] used in astronaut training and amusement park rides such as the [[Rotor (ride)|Rotor]], [[Mission: Space]] and the [[Gravitron]] can cause motion sickness in many people.  While the interior of the centrifuge does not appear to move, one will experience a sense of movement.  In addition, [[centrifugal force]] can cause the vestibular system to give one the sense that downward is in the direction away from the center of the centrifuge rather than the true downward direction.

====Dizziness due to spinning====
When one spins and stops suddenly, fluid in the inner ear continues to rotate causing a sense of continued spinning while one's visual system no longer detects motion.

===Motion that is seen but not felt===
In these cases, motion is detected by the [[visual system]] and hence the motion is seen, but no motion or little motion is sensed by the [[vestibular system]]. Motion sickness arising from such situations has been referred to as Visually Induced Motion Sickness (VIMS).<ref>So, R.H.Y. and Ujike, H. (2010) Visually induced motion sickness, visual stress and photosensitive epileptic seizures: what do they have in common? - Preface to the special issue. Applied Ergonomics, 41(4), pp.491-393.</ref>

====Motion sickness due to films and other video====
This type of sickness is particularly prevalent when susceptible people are watching films on large screens such as [[IMAX]] but may also occur in regular format theaters or even when watching TV.  For the sake of novelty, IMAX and other panoramic type theaters often show dramatic motions such as flying over a landscape or riding a [[roller coaster]].  There is little way to prevent this type of motion sickness except to close one's eyes during such scenes or to avoid such movies.

In regular format theaters, an example of a movie that caused motion sickness in many people is [[The Blair Witch Project]].  Theaters warned patrons of its possible nauseating effects, cautioning pregnant women in particular.  ''Blair Witch'' was filmed with a handheld [[camcorder]], which was subjected to considerably more motion than the average movie camera.

Home movies, often filmed with a hand-held camera, also tend to cause motion sickness in those that view them.  The camera-person rarely notices this during filming since his/her sense of motion matches the motion seen through the camera viewfinder.  Those who view the film afterward only see the movement, which may be considerable, without any sense of movement.  Using the zoom function seems to contribute to motion sickness as well as zooming is not a normal function of the eye.  The use of a tripod or a camcorder with [[image stabilization]] technology while filming can minimize this effect.

====Simulation sickness====
''Simulation sickness'', or simulator sickness, is a condition where a person exhibits symptoms similar to motion sickness caused by playing computer/simulation/video games.<ref name=benson/>

The most common theory for the cause of simulation sickness is that the illusion of motion created by the virtual world, combined with the absence of motion detected by the inner ear, causes the [[area postrema]] in the [[human brain]] to infer that one is hallucinating and further conclude that the hallucination is due to poison ingestion. The brain responds by inducing nausea and mass vomiting, to clear the supposed toxin.<ref name="GMO" /> According to this theory, simulation sickness is just another form of motion sickness.

The symptoms are often described as quite similar to that of motion sickness, and can range from headache, drowsiness, nausea, dizziness, vomiting and sweating.  Research done at the [[University of Minnesota]] had students play ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' for less than an hour, and found that up to 50 percent felt sick afterwards.<ref>[http://www.kvbc.com/Global/story.asp?s=4867083 Could video games be making your kids sick?]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref>

In a study conducted by U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in a report published May 1995 titled "Technical Report 1027 - Simulator Sickness in Virtual Environments", out of 742 pilot exposures from 11 military flight simulators, "approximately half of the pilots (334) reported post-effects of some kind: 250 (34%) reported that symptoms dissipated in less than 1 hour, 44 (6%) reported that symptoms lasted longer than 4 hours, and 28 (4%) reported that symptoms lasted longer than 6 hours. There were also 4 (1%) reported cases of spontaneously occurring flashbacks."<ref>[http://www.cyberedge.com/info_r_a+p05_ss-es.html CyberEdge Information Services: Health & Safety, Simulator Sickness in Virtual Environments: Executive Summary]</ref><ref>[http://www.gamingillustrated.com/video_game_sickness.php Video Game Simulator Sickness]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref>

The phenomenon was well known in popular culture before it was known as simulation sickness. In the 1983 comedy film ''[[Joysticks (film)|Joysticks]]'', the manager of a local video arcade says, "The reason why I never play any of these games, well, they make me physically ill. I mean, every time I look in one of the screens, they make me dizzy."

====Motion sickness due to virtual reality====
Motion sickness due to [[virtual reality]] is very similar to simulation sickness and motion sickness due to films.  In virtual reality, however, the effect is made more acute as all external reference points are blocked from vision, the simulated images are [[Stereoscopy|three-dimensional]] and in some cases stereo sound that may also give a sense of motion. The world's most advanced simulator, the NADS-1, located at the National Advanced Driving Simulator, is capable of accurately stimulating the vestibular system with a 360-degree horizontal field of view and 13 degree of freedom motion base.<ref>http://www.nads-sc.uiowa.edu/sim_nads1.php</ref> Studies have shown that exposure to rotational motions in a virtual environment can cause significant increases in nausea and other symptoms of motion sickness.<ref>So, R.H.Y. and Lo, W.T. (1999) "Cybersickness: An Experimental Study to Isolate the Effects of Rotational Scene Oscillations." Proceedings of IEEE Virtual Reality '99 Conference, March 13–17, 1999, Houston, Texas. Published by IEEE Computer Society, pp. 237–241.</ref>

====Space sickness====
{{Main|Space adaptation syndrome}}

''Space sickness'' was effectively unknown during the earliest spaceflights, as these were undertaken in very cramped conditions; it seems to be aggravated by being able to freely move around, and so is more common in larger spacecraft.<ref name=benson/> Around 60% of [[Space Shuttle]] astronauts currently experience it on their first flight; the first case is now suspected to be [[Gherman Titov]], in August 1961 onboard ''[[Vostok 2]]'', who reported dizziness and nausea. However, the first significant cases were in early Apollo flights; [[Frank Borman]] on ''[[Apollo 8]]'' and [[Rusty Schweickart]] on ''[[Apollo 9]]''. Both experienced identifiable and reasonably severe symptoms—in the latter case causing the mission plan to be modified.

===Motions that are seen and felt but do not correspond===

====Coriolis effect====
When moving within a rotating reference frame such as in a centrifuge or environment where [[Artificial_gravity#Rotation|gravity is simulated]] with centrifugal force, the [[coriolis effect]] causes a sense of motion in the vestibular system that does not match the motion that is seen.

Sometimes when riding a vehicle for a long time on a badly maintained road at a very slow (10–20&nbsp;km/h) speed the two senses fail to correspond. Due to the poor road quality the vehicle will jerk too much giving a sense of severe motion to the inner ear, but due to the slow speed the eye doesn't sense a proportional amount of motion.

== Treatment ==

Many cures and preventatives for motion sickness have been proposed.

=== Device ===

One eyewear device named ViBAN was issued a U.S. motion sickness patent and is designed to block motion outside a moving vehicle, a primary cause of motion or car sickness, allowing the wearer to focus on reading or electronic devices inside the vehicle. Removal of the outside visual stimuli may work in some affected by motion sickness or car sickness, however it is not known to help those with sea sickness, which is most often associated with inner ear conflict.US Patent 6,275,998: [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=6275998&OS=6275998&RS=6275998]

=== Activity ===

One common suggestion is to simply look out of the window of the moving vehicle and to gaze towards the horizon in the direction of travel. This helps to re-orient the inner [[Equilibrioception|sense of balance]] by providing a visual reaffirmation of motion.

In the night, or in a ship without windows, it is helpful to simply close one's eyes, or if possible, take a nap. This resolves the input conflict between the eyes and the inner ear. Napping also helps prevent psychogenic effects (i.e. the effect of sickness being magnified by thinking about it).

A simple method for relieving common and mild car sickness is chewing{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. Chewing gum has an uncanny effectiveness for reducing car sickness in those affected. Chewing gum, however, is not the only thing one may chew to relieve mild effects of car sickness, snacking on sweets or just chewing in general seems to reduce adverse effects of the conflict between vision and balance.

Fresh, cool air can also relieve motion sickness slightly, although it is likely this is related to avoiding foul odors which can worsen nausea.<ref>[http://www.leftseat.com/AME/motion.htm FAA Medical Certification / Alcohol / Substance / Drugs - Motion Sickness]</ref>

=== Medication ===
Over-the-counter and prescription medications are readily available, such as Dramamine ([[dimenhydrinate]]),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weinstein SE, Stern RM |title=Comparison of marezine and dramamine in preventing symptoms of motion sickness |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=68 |issue=10 |pages=890–4 |year=1997 |month=October |pmid=9327113 }}</ref> Stugeron ([[cinnarizine]]), and Bonine/Antivert ([[meclozine]]).  Stugeron is not available in the U.S. either over-the-counter or by prescription. It has been implicated in triggering palsy and has been banned by the FDA.<ref>Letter to editor [[Latitude 38 Magazine]] April 2006, by medical doctor detailing the dangers of Stugeron</ref>

[[Scopolamine]] is effective<ref name="pmid17636710">{{cite journal |author=Spinks A, Wasiak J, Villanueva E, Bernath V |title=Scopolamine (hyoscine) for preventing and treating motion sickness |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD002851 |year=2007 |pmid=17636710 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002851.pub3 |editor1-last=Wasiak |editor1-first=Jason}}</ref> and is sometimes used in the form of [[transdermal patch]]es (1.5&nbsp;mg) or as a newer tablet form (0.4&nbsp;mg).  The selection of a transdermal patch or scopolamine tablet is determined by a doctor after consideration of the patient's age, weight, and length of treatment time required.

Interestingly, many pharmacological treatments which are effective for nausea and vomiting in some medical conditions may not be effective for motion sickness. For example, [[metoclopramide]] and [[prochlorperazine]], although widely used for nausea, are ineffective for motion-sickness prevention and treatment. This is due to the physiology of the [[central nervous system|CNS]] vomiting centre and its inputs from the chemoreceptor trigger zone versus the inner ear. Sedating anti-histamine medications such as [[promethazine]] work quite well for motion sickness, although they can cause significant drowsiness.

[[Ginger]] root is commonly thought to be an effective [[anti-emetic]].  One trial review indicated that sucking on crystallized ginger or sipping ginger tea can help to relieve the nausea,<ref name="Ernst_Pittler_2000">{{cite journal | last = Ernst | first = E. | coauthors = and M. H. Pittler | date=1 March 2000| title = Efficacy of ginger for nausea and vomiting: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 84 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–371 | url = http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/3/367 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-09-06 | pmid = 10793599 }}</ref> while an earlier study indicated that it had only a placebo effect.<ref>Wood CD. Pharmacological countermeasures against motion sickness. In Crampton GH, ed. Motion and Space Sickness. CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1990, p. 344.</ref> Tests conducted on the television shows [[Mythbusters]] and [[Food Detectives]] support the theory that ginger is an effective treatment for the nausea caused by motion sickness.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wikipedia|url= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters_%282005_season%29#Seasickness_-_Kill_or_Cure.3F|title=Episode Listing (Wikipedia)}}</ref>

Ginger is reported to calm the pyloric valve located at the base of the stomach.<ref name="Ernst_Pittler_2000" /> This relaxation of the valve allows the stomach to operate normally whereby the contents will enter the small intestine instead of being retained within the stomach. It is this undesirable effect of retention in the stomach that eventually results in vomiting. Vomiting is not seasickness but is only a symptom or side effect; although the effect most commonly associated with seasickness.
This link reports on a ginger study; notice the comment about less vomiting when taking ginger, but not less nausea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esys.org/seekrank/sekrnk11.html|title=Seasickness Studies about ginger|work=EUROPÄISCHES SEGEL-INFORMATIONSSYSTEM}}</ref>

=== Electronic ===
As astronauts frequently have motion sickness, [[NASA]] has done extensive research on the causes and treatments for motion sickness. One very promising looking treatment is for the person suffering from motion sickness to wear LCD shutter glasses that create a stroboscopic vision of 4&nbsp;Hz with a dwell of 10 milliseconds.<ref>[http://www.dsls.usra.edu/meetings/hrp2007/pdf/Neurovestibular/3140Reschke.pdf Stroboscopic Vision as a Treatment for Space Motion Sickness]</ref>
