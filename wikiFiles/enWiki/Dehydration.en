In physiology and medicine, '''dehydration''' (''hypohydration'') is the excessive loss of [[body water]],<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2933 "Definition of dehydration"] at medicine net</ref> with an accompanying disruption of [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]]. It is literally the removal of [[water]] ({{lang-grc|ὕδωρ|hýdōr}}) from an object; however, in [[Physiology|physiological]] terms, it entails a deficiency of fluid within an organism. Dehydration of [[human skin|skin]] and [[mucous membranes]] can be called [[Dryness (medical)|medical dryness]].

Some authors have reported three types of dehydration based on serum sodium levels: hypotonic or hyponatremic (referring to this as primarily a loss of [[electrolyte]]s, [[sodium]] in particular), hypertonic or hypernatremic (referring to this as primarily a loss of water), and isotonic or isonatremic (referring to this as equal loss of water and electrolytes).<ref>{{cite book |first1=Gary Robert |last1=Fleisher |first2=Stephen |last2=Ludwig |title=Textbook of Pediatric Emergency Medicine |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=a7CqcE1ZrFkC&pg=PA811 |year=2010 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |isbn=978-1-60547-159-4 |page=811}}</ref> In reality however, it emerges
that by "hyponatremic" and "eunatremic" dehydration these authors are actually referring to "hypovolemia" (see definition below).
In humans, it is thought that the most commonly seen type of dehydration by far is isotonic (isonatraemic) dehydration, but this effectively refers to [[hypovolemia]]. "Dehydration", is thus a term that has loosely been used to mean loss of water, regardless of whether it is as water and solutes (mainly sodium) or free water. Those who refer to hypotonic dehydration therefore refer to solute loss and thus loss of intravascular volume but in the presence of exaggerated intravascular volume depletion for a given amount of total body water gain. It is true that neurological complications can occur in hypotonic and hypertonic states. The former can lead to [[seizure]]s, while the latter can lead to [[osmotic cerebral edema]] upon rapid [[rehydration]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|906999|Dehydration}}</ref> It is thus important to distinguish "dehydration" from "hypovolemia" and maybe limit the term "dehydration" to states of "hypernatremia" and call all other usage "hypovolemia" as that would greatly facilitate management.

==Definition==
[[Hypovolemia]] is specifically a decrease in volume of [[blood plasma]].<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3871 MedicineNet > Definition of Hypovolemia] Retrieved on July 2, 2009</ref><ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hypovolemia TheFreeDictionary.com --> hypovolemia] Citing Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed. Retrieved on July 2, 2009</ref> and dehydration is specifically a decrease in total body water, that for the most part spares blood plasma volume. Humans can lose water from the body — of any aetiology — but that loss can only occur in two distinct patterns with separate mechanisms:
*a) Loss of blood volume
*b) Loss of tissue water

Not only do both have different manifestations, the mechanism of the water loss that leads to a) or b) is distinct. a) can only occur if sodium is lost and the water loss is secondary to this sodium loss and mainly blood plasma water. b) can only occur if [[pure]] water loss is independent of sodium loss and mainly derived from intracellular water. Both can co-exist ie sodium and water loss that is not balanced ie more water loss than expected for sodium loss. Dehydration then refers to pure (tissue) water loss and hypovolemia to sodium loss and thus loss of blood volume. This is the correct and pure definition<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mange K, Matsuura D, Cizman B, ''et al.'' |title=Language guiding therapy: the case of dehydration versus volume depletion |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=127 |issue=9 |pages=848–53 |year=1997 |month=November |pmid=9382413 |url=http://www.annals.org/article.aspx?volume=127&page=848}}</ref> but unfortunately gets wildly mixed up. Very interestingly the opposite can also occur ie overhydration as well as hypervolemia. Finally they do not need to move in the same direction ie a person can be hypervolemic and dehydrated at the same time and any combination of these six states can coexist — if we count euvolemia and normal hydration.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Symptom]]s may include  [[headache]]s<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shirreffs SM, Merson SJ, Fraser SM, Archer DT |title=The effects of fluid restriction on hydration status and subjective feelings in man |journal=Br. J. Nutr. |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=951–8 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15182398 |doi=10.1079/BJN20041149 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0007114504001163}}</ref> similar to what is experienced during a [[hangover]], decreased [[blood pressure]] ([[hypotension]]), and [[dizziness]] or [[fainting]] when standing up due to [[orthostatic hypotension]].  Untreated dehydration generally results in [[delirium]], [[unconsciousness]], swelling of the tongue and, in extreme cases, [[death]].

Dehydration symptoms generally become noticeable after 2% of one's normal water volume has been lost.  Initially, one experiences [[thirst]] and discomfort, possibly along with loss of [[appetite]] and [[dry skin]]. This can be followed by [[constipation]]. [[sportsperson|Athlete]]s may suffer a loss of performance of up to 30%<ref>{{cite book

[[Symptom]]s of mild dehydration include [[thirst]], decreased [[urine]] volume, abnormally dark urine, unexplained tiredness, irritability, lack of tears when crying, [[headache]], [[dry mouth]], [[dizziness]] when standing due to [[orthostatic hypotension]], and in some cases insomnia.  Other possible symptoms include cloudy urine and stinging during urination. Blood tests may show [[hyperalbuminemia]].  Mild dehydration also has been shown to negatively impact people’s moods.  Experiments by the [[USDA]]'s [http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/main.htm Agricultural Research Service] have shown that dehydration is associated with [[confusion]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and negative moods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2009/091123.htm#_top |title=Dehydration Affects Mood, Not Just Motor Skills / November 23, 2009 / News from the USDA Agricultural Research Service |publisher=Ars.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>  Mild dehydration, which includes water losses between 1% and 2%, observed in the experiment are comparable to mild dehydration experienced by people in their everyday lives.

In moderate to severe dehydration, there may be no urine output at all.  Other symptoms in these states include [[lethargy]] or extreme sleepiness, [[seizure]]s, sunken [[fontanel]] (soft spot) in infants, [[fainting]], and sunken eyes.

The symptoms become increasingly severe with greater water loss. One's heart and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] rates begin to increase to compensate for decreased [[blood plasma|plasma]] volume and [[blood pressure]], while body temperature may rise because of decreased sweating. At around 5% to 6% water loss, one may become groggy or sleepy, experience headaches or [[nausea]], and may feel tingling in one's limbs ([[paresthesia]]).  With 10% to 15% fluid loss, muscles may become spastic, skin may shrivel and wrinkle (decreased skin turgor), vision may dim, urination will be greatly reduced and may become painful, and delirium may begin.  Losses greater than 15% are usually fatal.

In people over age 50, the body’s [[thirst]] sensation diminishes and continues diminishing with age. Many senior citizens suffer symptoms of dehydration. Dehydration along with [[hyperthermia]] results in the elderly dying suddenly during extreme hot weather.

Diseases of the gastrointestinal tract can lead to dehydration in various ways. Often, dehydration becomes the major problem in an otherwise self-limited illness. Fluid loss may even be severe enough to become life-threatening.

In studies of terminally ill patients who have chosen to die, it has been shown that deaths by [[terminal dehydration]] are generally peaceful, and are not associated with suffering when supplemented with adequate pain medication.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Printz LA |title=Terminal dehydration, a compassionate treatment |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=152 |issue=4 |pages=697–700 |year=1992 |month=April |pmid=1373053 |doi=10.1001/archinte.152.4.697 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1373053}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sullivan RJ |title=Accepting death without artificial nutrition or hydration |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=220–224 |year=1993 |month=April |pmid=8515334 |doi=10.1007/BF02599271 |url=}}</ref>

== Differential diagnosis ==
In humans, dehydration can be caused by a wide range of diseases and states that impair
water [[homeostasis]] in the body. These include:

* External or [[stress (medicine)|stress]]-related causes
** Prolonged physical activity with [[sweating]] without consuming adequate water, especially in a hot and/or dry environment
** Prolonged exposure to dry air, e.g., in high-flying airplanes (5%–12% relative humidity)
** [[Blood loss]] or [[hypotension]] due to [[physical trauma]]
** [[Diarrhea]]
** [[Hyperthermia]]
** [[shock (circulatory)|Shock]] (hypovolemic)
** [[Vomiting]]
** [[Burn (injury)|Burns]]
** [[Lacrimation]]
** Use of [[methamphetamine]], [[amphetamine]] and other stimulants
** Excessive consumption of [[alcoholic beverages]]

* [[Infectious diseases]]

** [[Electrolyte disturbance]]
*** [[Hypernatremia]] (also caused by dehydration)
*** [[Hyponatremia]], especially from restricted [[sodium chloride|salt]] [[Dieting|diet]]s
** [[Fasting]]
** Recent rapid [[weight loss]] may reflect progressive depletion of fluid volume (the loss of 1 L of fluid results in a weight loss of 1&nbsp;kg (2.2&nbsp;lb)).<ref>[http://www.heartspring.net/symptoms_of_dehydration.html Dehydration Symptoms — Benefits of Drinking Water — Signs of Fluid Imbalance<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

* [[Surgery]]

==Prevention==

Dehydration is best avoided by [[drinking]] sufficient [[water]]. The greater the amount of water lost through perspiration, the more water must be consumed to replace it and avoid dehydration. Since the body cannot tolerate large deficits or excesses in total body water, consumption of water must be roughly concurrent with the loss (in other words, if one is perspiring, one should also be drinking some water frequently).

For routine activities in which a person is not perspiring to any large degree, drinking when one is thirsty is sufficient to maintain hydration.  However, during exercise, relying on thirst alone may be insufficient to prevent dehydration from occurring.  This is particularly true in hot environments or for those older than 65.  For an exercise session, an accurate determination of how much fluid is necessary to consume during the workout can be made by performing appropriate weight measurements before and after a typical exercise session, to determine how much fluid is lost during the workout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/water-water-everywhere|title=Water, Water, Everywhere|publisher=WebMD}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.msn.com/blogs/healthy-diet-fit-body-post.aspx?post=1188190|title=Metabolism Myth #5|publisher=MSN Health|author=Dr. Mark Dedomenico}}{{Dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref name="Exercise and Fluid Replacement">{{cite journal |author=Sawka MN, Burke LM, Eichner ER, Maughan RJ, Montain SJ, Stachenfeld NS |title=American College of Sports Medicine position stand.

Drinking water beyond the needs of the body entails little risk when done in moderation, since the kidneys will efficiently remove any excess water through the urine with a large margin of safety.

A person's body, during an average day in a temperate climate such as the [[United Kingdom]], loses approximately 2.5 [[litre]]s of water.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} This can be through the lungs as [[water vapor]] (about 350ml), through the skin by [[perspiration]] (100ml) and by diffusion through the skin (350ml), or through the [[kidney]]s as [[urine]] (1000–2000ml, about 900ml of which is obligatory water excretion that gets rid of solutes). Some water (about 150–200ml, in the absence of [[diarrhea]]) is also lost through the [[bowel]]s.<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/health/minerals/major/section1.html|title=Major Minerals|publisher=SparkNotes|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> In warm or humid weather or during heavy exertion, however, the water loss can increase by a factor of 10 or more{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} through perspiration; all of which must be promptly replaced.  In extreme cases, the losses may be great enough to exceed the body's ability to absorb water from the gastrointestinal tract; in these cases, it is not possible to drink enough water to stay hydrated, and the only way to avoid dehydration is to either pre-hydrate<ref name="Exercise and Fluid Replacement"/> or find ways to reduce perspiration (through rest, a move to a cooler environment, etc.)

A useful rule of thumb for avoiding dehydration in hot or humid environments or during strenuous activity involves monitoring the frequency and character of urination. If one develops a full bladder at least every 3–5 hours and the urine is only lightly colored or colorless, chances are that dehydration is not occurring; if urine is deeply colored or urination occurs only after many hours or not at all, water intake may not be adequate to maintain proper hydration.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

When large amounts of water are being lost through perspiration and concurrently replaced by drinking, maintaining proper electrolyte balance becomes an issue. Drinking fluids that are [[Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] or [[Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] with respect to perspiration may have grave consequences ([[hyponatremia]] or [[hypernatremia]], principally) as the total volume of water turnover increases.

If water is being lost through mechanisms such as [[vomiting]] or [[diarrhea]], an imbalance can develop very quickly into a medical emergency.

During sports events such as [[marathon]]s, athletes take frequent [[water stop (sports)|water stop]]s and [[water break]]s to avoid dehydration. The claim that pure water without isotonic additives can prevent dehydration is questioned, however, and the [[European Food Safety Authority]] states that reduced body water content is only a symptom of dehydration and not what drinking water controls.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/8897662/EU-bans-claim-that-water-can-prevent-dehydration.html|title=EU bans claim that water can prevent dehydration|publisher=The Telegraph|author=Victoria Ward and Nick Collins|date=November 18, 2011}}</ref> Drinking water without replenishing electrolytes may instead lead to developing hypotonic dehydration.

== Treatment ==
{{Main|Management of dehydration}}
The treatment for minor dehydration, often considered the most effective, is drinking water and stopping fluid loss. Plain water restores only the volume of the blood plasma, inhibiting the thirst mechanism before solute levels can be replenished.<ref>"." Murray, R. & , J. (2001){{cite book |first2=Robert |last3=Murray |first2=John |last2=Stofan |chapter=Ch. 8: Formulating carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks for optimal efficacy |editor1-first=Ron J. |editor1-last=Maughan |editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Murray |title=Sports Drinks: Basic Science and Practical Aspects |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=bS12dnUsGJcC&pg=PA197 |year=2001 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-7008-3 |pages=197–224}}</ref> Solid foods can contribute to fluid loss from vomiting and diarrhea.<ref>"Healthwise Handbook," Healthwise, Inc. 1999</ref>

In more severe cases, correction of a dehydrated state is accomplished by the replenishment of necessary water and [[electrolyte]]s (through [[oral rehydration therapy]] or [[fluid replacement]] by [[intravenous therapy]]). As oral rehydration is less painful, less invasive, less expensive, and easier to provide, it is the treatment of choice for mild dehydration. Solutions used for intravenous rehydration must be [[Isotonicity|isotonic]] or [[Hypotonicity|hypotonic]].  Pure water injected into the veins will cause the breakdown ([[lysis]]) of red blood cells ([[erythrocytes]]).

When [[fresh water]] is unavailable (e.g., at sea or in a desert), [[seawater]], [[alcohol]], and even [[urine]] will worsen the condition.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

For severe cases of dehydration where [[fainting]], [[unconsciousness]], or other severely inhibiting symptom is present (the patient is incapable of standing or thinking clearly), emergency attention is required. Fluids containing a proper balance of replacement electrolytes are given orally or intravenously with continuing assessment of electrolyte status; complete resolution is the norm in all but the most extreme cases.

Some research indicates that artificial hydration to alleviate symptoms of dry mouth and thirst in the dying patient may be futile.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ellershaw JE, Sutcliffe JM, Saunders CM |title=Dehydration and the dying patient |journal=J Pain Symptom Manage |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=192–7 |year=1995 |month=April |pmid=7629413 |doi=10.1016/0885-3924(94)00123-3 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0885-3924(94)00123-3}}</ref>
