'''Cellulite''' (also known as '''adiposis edematosa''', '''dermopanniculosis deformans''', '''status protrusus cutis''', '''gynoid lipodystrophy''', '''orange peel syndrome''' and '''cottage cheese skin''') is the [[hernia]]tion of subcutaneous [[adipose tissue|fat]] within fibrous [[connective tissue]] that manifests topographically as [[human skin|skin]] dimpling and nodularity, often on the [[pelvic]] region (specifically the [[buttocks]]), [[human leg|lower limbs]], and [[abdomen]].<ref name =Rossi>{{cite journal |author = Rossi AB, Vergnanini AL |title = Cellulite: a review |journal = J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol |volume = 14 |issue = 4 |pages = 251–62 |year = 2000 |month = July |pmid = 11204512 |doi = 10.1046/j.1468-3083.2000.00016.x |url = }}</ref><ref>PINNA, K.

==History==
The term was first used in the 1920s, and began appearing in English language publications in the late 1960s, with the earliest reference in [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'' magazine]], "Like a swift migrating fish, the word ''cellulite'' has suddenly crossed the Atlantic."<ref>''Vogue'' 15 Apr 1968 110/1</ref> Its existence as a real disorder has been questioned,<ref name="pmid632386">{{cite journal |author = Nürnberger F, Müller G |title = So-called cellulite: an invented disease |journal = J Dermatol Surg Oncol |volume = 4 |issue = 3 |pages = 221–9 |year = 1978 |month = March |pmid = 632386 |doi =  |url = }}</ref> and the prevailing medical opinion is that it is merely the "normal condition of many women".<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|002033|Cellulite}}</ref> One cosmetic company has noted its historical place in industrialised societies as an "inappropriate term used by women to describe curves which they judge to be too plump and not very aesthetic".<ref name="pmid14567186">{{cite journal |author = Franchi J, Pellicier F, André P, Schnebert S |title = [The adipocyte in the history of slimming agents] |language = French |journal = Pathol.

;Hormonal factors
Hormones play a dominant role in the formation of cellulite. [[Estrogen]] may be the important hormone to initiate and aggravate cellulite. However, there has been no reliable clinical evidence to support such a claim. Other hormones, including [[insulin]], the [[catecholamines]] [[adrenaline]] and [[noradrenaline]], [[thyroid hormone]]s, and [[prolactin]], are all believed to participate in the development of cellulite.<ref name="Rossi" />

;Genetic factors
There is a genetic element in individual susceptibility to cellulite.<ref name="Rossi" /> Researchers led by [[Enzo Emanuele]] have traced the genetic component of cellulite to particular [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|polymorphisms]] in the [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] ([[angiotensin converting enzyme|ACE]]) and [[HIF1A|hypoxia-inducible factor 1A]] ([[HIF1A|HIF1a]]) genes.<ref name="doi 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2009.03556.x" />

;Predisposing factors
Several factors have been shown to affect the development of cellulite. [[Sex]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], biotype,<ref>A population within a species that has distinct genetic variation.</ref> distribution of subcutaneous fat, and [[Genetic predisposition|predisposition]] to lymphatic and circulatory insufficiency have all been shown to contribute to cellulite.<ref name="Rossi" />

;Lifestyle
A high-[[Stress (medicine)|stress]] lifestyle will cause an increase in the level of [[catecholamines]], which have also been associated with the evolution of cellulite.<ref name="Rossi" /> Certain dieting practices can also diminish the level of these chemicals, and decreasing body fat typically results in the reduction in appearance of cellulite.

==Treatment==
Numerous therapies for the treatment of cellulite are available, but empirical evidence for the efficacy of these strategies is limited.<ref name="pmid16020201"/> In an interview with the ''[[New York Times]]'', Molly Wanner, an instructor in [[dermatology]] at [[Harvard Medical School]] and an author of a 2008 evidence-based review of existing treatments, asserted: "At this point, there is no outstanding treatment for cellulite."<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite web |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/fashion/25skinintro.html |title = Treating Cellulite?
