'''Anil Potti''' (born 10 May 1972, Hyderabad, India){{cn|date=May 2012}} is a physician and former [[Duke University]] medical researcher, focusing on [[oncogenomics]]. He is the center of a research fabrication scandal at [[Duke University]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/2012/02/60-minutes-to-delve-into-potti-case.html |title=60 Minutes to delve into Potti case (Triangle Business Journal, February 10, 2012 |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=10 February 2012 |first=Jason |last=Debruyn}}</ref><ref name="Deception at Duke">[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57376073/deception-at-duke "Deception at Duke"], ''60 Minutes'', [[CBS]], 12 February 2012</ref> and many of his scientific publications have been retracted.

== Biography ==
Anil Potti graduated from Christian Medical College, Vellore, India in 1995.<ref name="North Carolina Medical Board">{{cite web|url=http://wwwapps.ncmedboard.org/Clients/NCBOM/Public/LicenseeInformationSearch.aspx |title=North Carolina Medical Board |publisher=Pps.ncmedboard.org}}</ref> He finished an internship in Internal Medicine at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine in 1999.<ref name="North Carolina Medical Board" /> In 2006 Potti completed training in hematology and oncology at [[Duke University]].<ref name="North Carolina Medical Board" />

Potti resigned from Duke in 2010, following the discovery of flaws in the genomics research conducted at Duke and allegations of embellishments in his resume, assuming responsibility for the anomalies in the scientific research.<ref name="Anil Potti, Duke Cancer Researcher Accused of Misconduct, Resigns">[http://dukechronicle.com/article/anil-potti-duke-cancer-researcher-accused-misconduct-resigns "Anil Potti, Duke Cancer Researcher Accused of Misconduct, Resigns"], Duke Chronicle </ref>

==Alleged misconduct==
Potti is alleged to have engaged in [[scientific misconduct]] while a cancer researcher at both Duke University's Medical Center and [[Duke University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. He resigned in November 2010 after Duke put him on administrative leave, terminated the clinical trials based on his research and retracted his published data.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/health/research/21cancer.html|title=Duke Scientist Suspended Over Rhodes Scholarship Claim|work=New York Times|date=20 July 2010|accessdate=26 December 2011}}</ref><ref name="Anil Potti, Duke Cancer Researcher Accused of Misconduct, Resigns">[http://dukechronicle.com/article/anil-potti-duke-cancer-researcher-accused-misconduct-resigns "Anil Potti, Duke Cancer Researcher Accused of Misconduct, Resigns"], ''Duke Chronicle''</ref><ref>[http://dukechronicle.com/article/suspended-cancer-trials-terminated "Suspended cancer trials terminated"], ''Duke Chronicle''</ref>

==Fallout==

The [[American Cancer Society]] stopped payments of a five-year grant which totalled $729,000 as Potti had received the grant based on his credentials.<ref>{{cite news|last=Singer|first=N|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/health/research/21cancer.html|title=Duke Scientist Suspended Over Rhodes Scholar Claims.%7C2010|accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref> Duke University later reimbursed the American Cancer Society for the full amount of the grant. Healthcare companies cut ties with Potti after evidence surfaced that Potti fabricated awards on his resume.<ref>[http://dukechronicle.com/article/health-care-companies-cut-ties-potti "Health care companies cut ties with Potti"], ''Duke Chronicle</ref>

Three clinical trials at [[Duke University Medical Center]] based on Potti's research came under scrutiny in 2009 and were temporarily suspended, then were permanently stopped in 2010.<ref>http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110111/full/469139a.html</ref><ref>[http://dukechronicle.com/article/cancer-research-questioned "Cancer research questioned"], ''Duke Chronicle''</ref> The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (USFDA) reviewed one of the studies in 2009, several years after its initiation, and concluded that the study would require an Investigational New Drug application, which had not been submitted.<ref>http://www.cancerletter.com/downloads/20120127_1/download</ref> An FDA audit in 2011 further showed that an Investigational Device Exemption application had not been filed, but otherwise found "no significant deficiencies" in Duke's IRB conduct.<ref name="Deception at Duke"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.nbc17.com/news/2012/feb/10/nbc-17-investigates-fda-findings-duke-audit-ar-1917827/ |title=NBC-17 Investigates FDA findings in Duke audit |publisher=NBC17.com}}</ref> Potti's medical license record with the North Carolina Medical Board shows eleven settlements, each of at least $75,000, for incidents that appear to be related to these trials.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/print-edition/2011/12/30/payouts-mount-for-ex-duke-doc-for.html|title=Payouts mount for ex-Duke doc for malpractice – Triangle Business Journal|publisher=Bizjournals.com|date=13 March 2011|accessdate=30 December 2011|first=Jason|last=Debruyn}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/news_briefs/story/10553809|title=Disgraced Duke researcher settles malpractice claims|publisher=WRAL.com|accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>

In late 2011, the North Carolina Medical Board reprimanded Potti<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/anil-potti-reprimanded-by-north-carolina-state-medical-board-as-lawsuit-settlements-surface|title=Anil Potti reprimanded by North Carolina state medical board, as lawsuit settlements surface "Retraction Watch|publisher=Retractionwatch.wordpress.com|accessdate=26 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2012/feb/16/tainted-doctor-working-in-sc/ |title=Tainted doctor working in S.C.

In its consent order, the North Carolina Medical Board stated that the board has no evidence from which it could conclude that Dr. Potti received funding for medical research as a result of the inaccuracies that he would not have otherwise received, but concluded that "...Potti's conduct as described herein constitutes unprofessional conduct..." {{cite web|url=http://wwwapps.ncmedboard.org/Clients/NCBOM/Public/LicenseeInformationDetails.aspx?&EntityID=16218&PublicFile=1 | title= NCMB Action Revised}}. In separate action on Potti's medical license, the North Carolina Medical Board reviewed 11 payments made to settle malpractice claims and posted on its website that "no public action was warranted”.

In January 2011 Potti applied for a medical license in [[South Carolina]], which was approved in April 2011.<ref name="SC">{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2012/feb/23/doctors-troubles-continue/ |title=Troubles continue for former Duke oncologist (Charleston Post and Courier, February 23, 20120) |publisher=Postandcourier.com}}</ref> Potti was employed as a practising physician at the Coastal Cancer Center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coastalcancercenter.com/your-team/anil-potti-md|title=Coastal Cancer Center|publisher=Coastal Cancer Center|accessdate=26 December 2011}}</ref> in [[Loris, South Carolina|Loris]] from March 2011 until 21 February 2012.<ref name="SC" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/anil-potti-resurfaces-at-south-carolina-cancer-center|title=Anil Potti resurfaces at South Carolina cancer center "Retraction Watch|publisher=Retractionwatch.wordpress.com|accessdate=26 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/2012/02/cancer-researcher-potti-loses-his-sc.html | first=Jason | last=Debruyn | title=Cancer researcher Potti loses his S.C. job | date=22 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/developing-anil-pottis-future-at-coastal-cancer-center-seems-unclear/|title=Updated: Anil Potti out at Coastal Cancer Center; practice blames Duke for glowing recommendations|publisher=Retractionwatch.wordpress.com|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> Potti was also issued a medical license in Missouri on 1 February 2011; on 6 March 2012, the Missouri medical board (known as the Board of Registration for the Healing Arts) issued a reprimand on the basis of actions taken by the North Carolina Medical Board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pr.mo.gov/healingarts.asp |title=Board of Registration for the Healing Arts |publisher=Pr.mo.gov |date=28 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/potti-reprimanded-missouri-medical-board |title=Potti reprimanded by Missouri medical board (The Chronicle, March 12, 2012) |publisher=Dukechronicle.com}}</ref>

In addition to the settlements, two lawsuits also have been filed against Potti, as well as against Duke and other medical personnel there, charging medical negligence among other claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=news/abc11_investigates&id=8346506|title=Duke sued over clinical trials|publisher=ABC News|date=8 September 2011|accessdate=26 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/15553581/article-Second-lawsuit-filed-against-Duke-for-Potti%E2%80%99s-research?instance=homethirdleft|title=Second lawsuit filed against Duke for Potti's research|publisher=The Herald Sun|accessdate=26 December 2011}}</ref> In his response to the lawsuits, Potti stated that he was "not aware that false or improper data was included in the research."

Dr. Robert Califf of Duke testified that they had looked at 40 of Potti's publications and that two-thirds of them would be retracted in whole or in part. Science reported this as "The fallout from the Duke case includes 27 papers that Duke expects to be partially or completely retracted..."

==Research questions and Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on 'Omics'==
Following questions raised about genomics research that was led by Potti and Nevins at Duke between 2004 and 2010,<ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx">{{cite web|url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx |title=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx |publisher=Iom.edu}}</ref><ref name="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/panel-calls-for-closer-oversight.html?ref=ra">{{cite web|last=Kaiser |first=Jocelyn |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/panel-calls-for-closer-oversight.html?ref=ra |title=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/panel-calls-for-closer-oversight.html?ref=ra |publisher=News.sciencemag.org}}</ref> the National Cancer Institute requested that the IOM establish a committee to recommend ways to strengthen omics-based test development and evaluation. The IOM's recommendations released in March 2012 spoke to the many parties responsible for discovery and development of omics-based tests, including investigators, their institutions, sponsors of research, the FDA, and journals.<ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx" /><ref name="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/panel-calls-for-closer-oversight.html?ref=ra" /> The report identified best practices to enhance development, evaluation, and translation of omics-based tests while simultaneously reinforcing steps to ensure that these tests are appropriately assessed for scientific validity before they are used to guide patient treatment in clinical trials.<ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx" /><ref name="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/panel-calls-for-closer-oversight.html?ref=ra" /> The IOM’s recommendations aimed to ensure that progress in omics test development is grounded in sound scientific practice and is reproducible, resulting not only in improved health care but also in continued public trust.<ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx" /><ref name="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/panel-calls-for-closer-oversight.html?ref=ra" /> (Read more: [http://heraldsun.com/bookmark/18034733#ixzz1qc4WUBk4 The Herald-Sun]{{dead link|date=February 2013}})

The IOM report further added that “failure by many parties [at Duke] to detect or act on problems with key data and computational methods … led to the inappropriate enrollment of patients in clinical trials, premature launch of companies and retraction of dozens of research papers.<ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx" /><ref name="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/panel-calls-for-closer-oversight.html?ref=ra" /> The report specifically called for scientific investigators to make the data, computer codes and computational procedures used to develop their clinical tests “publicly accessible for independent review” and to ensure that their data and research steps are presented comprehensibly.<ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx" /><ref name="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/panel-calls-for-closer-oversight.html?ref=ra" /> The report also found that so-called "omics" tests – such as genomics and proteomics, which are diagnostic tools based on molecular patterns – are in general highly prone to errors. IOM committee chair Gilbert Omenn, a computational biologist at the University of Michigan, said the problems could have been avoided. But he noted, as well, that those kind of problems were not unique to Duke."There are a lot of lessons here that surely apply to other places," Omenn said.

==Lingering questions==
One question that neither Duke nor people involved in the research have been able to explicitly answer thus far is how data corruption or manipulation that would require thorough knowledge of [[DNA microarray|microarray data warehouse]] (large specialised databases) as well as bioinformatics occurred. 
Dr. Robert Califf's comments about TMQF<ref>{{cite web |url=http://medschool.duke.edu/research/translational-medicine-quality-framework |title=TMQ Framework|publisher=Duke Medical School|date=1 May 2011}}</ref> only addresses data provenance, adequate quantitative collaboration, accountability and open dialogue about issues beyond the individual lab and systems to deal with conflict of interest.

In a curt exchange with committee member Thomas Fleming, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington, Dr. Joseph Nevins refused to say how he believed the data problems occurred. When Fleming pointed out that because the problems in the data improved the experimental results, it seemed that they were introduced intentionally. “I can’t address it,” Nevins responded. “I just can’t get into a position of speculating on how it happened.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dukechronicle.com/article/nevins-defends-duke-response-flawed-data |title=Nevins exchange with Committee|publisher=Duke Chronicle|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110407074148/http://dukechronicle.com/article/nevins-defends-duke-response-flawed-data| archivedate= 7 April 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The following ten retracted papers that Potti coauthored were retracted for varying reasons.

;''Gene-expression Patterns Predict Phenotypes of Immune-mediated Thrombosis''

This article was published in the journal ''Blood''. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) affects about 3 in 1000 Americans. Out of the three, 10% have aPLAs. This study consisted of 129 patients. Out of those 129, 57 had APS and VTE, 32 had VTE without aPLA, 32 had aPLA, and 8 were healthy. Gene-expression proﬁles identify and predict individuals with APS from patients with VTE without aPLA.
