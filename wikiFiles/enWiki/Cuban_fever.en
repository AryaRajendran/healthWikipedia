'''Cuban fever''' (or '''calentura''') was a popular name for a recurring form of tropical fever, sometimes accompanied by acute [[delirium]].<ref name=new>[http://books.google.com/books?id=DC4WAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA758&dq=cuban+fever&lr=#v=onepage&q=cuban%20fever&f=false 3 New International Encyclopaedia], p. 758 (Gilman, Peck, & Colby eds. 1902)</ref> Its sufferers included U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].<ref name=teddy> Edmund Morris, “Theodore Rex: 1901-1909,” p. 377 (2001), ISBN 0-394-55509-0.</ref>  In 1898, a pathologist established that Cuban fever was a variety of [[malaria]].<ref name=ybook>[http://books.google.com/books?id=jJ8YAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA242&dq=cuban+fever&lr=&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q=cuban%20fever&f=false The International Year Book 1898], p. 242-43 (Colby & Peck eds. 1899).</ref> 

The term “Cuban fever” was coined by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] Doctor Alexander McCall in his 1845 letter to the ''Boston Medical and Surgical Journal'', describing a very protracted form of “[[Erysipelas|erysipelatous]] fever” he had observed in [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Yucatan Peninsula]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=GbUEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA136&dq=cuban+fever&lr=#v=onepage&q=cuban%20fever&f=false July 1845 Letter, “Erysipelatous Fever,”] 33 Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, p. 135 (1846).</ref> In 1860 social reformer and author [[Julia Ward Howe]] described a condition she observed in a Cuban prison as Cuban fever.<ref> Julia Ward Howe, [http://books.google.com/books?id=vgMZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA88&dq=Julia+Howe+Cuba+fever&lr=&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false A Trip to Cuba], p. 88 (1860).</ref>

The phrase was revived in the [[Spanish-American War]] to refer to a fever prevalent in Cuba and [[the Philippines]],<ref name=new/> that attacked many of the American troops during the War or shortly after their return.<ref name=ybook/> It generally began with a chill and a body temperature of {{nowrap|103 °F}}.  As the temperature rose higher, muscular pains began, with headache, loss of appetite, nausea, and marked weakness.<ref name=new/>  Many patients spontaneously recovered within a week.<ref name=new/> However, the symptoms would often recur, sometimes daily, and sometimes at intervals of days or weeks.<ref name=nyt>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9501E1D91730E132A25751C2A9659C94689ED7CF Letter to the Editor, “Chronic Cuban Fever,”] New York Times, p. 6, 1899-03-22.</ref>  U.S. Army Major General [[William Rufus Shafter]] was repeatedly sidelined with Cuban fever after he returned home.<ref>”[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E06E0D8143CE433A25753C3A96F9C94699ED7CF General Shafter Very Ill],” New York Times 1899-09-30 at 1; [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B07EFD71730E132A25756C1A9629C94689ED7CF  “General Shafter Ill at Buffalo,”] New York Times, 1899-04-15 at p. 1.</ref>

In an effort to establish a [[retrospective diagnosis]], pathologist [[James Ewing (pathologist)|James Ewing]] of [[New York]] studied blood samples of 800 patients suffering from the disease, and found that 80 percent of the cases of Cuban fever were of the aestiva-autumnal type of malarial fever, and the remaining 20 percent suffered from tertian malaria.<ref name=ybook/>

After leading the “[[Rough Riders]]” of the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry in the Spanish-American War, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, like many of his troops, was diagnosed with Cuban fever.<ref name=teddy/> Although Roosevelt's doctors were treating it with drugs, the fever continued to recur long after he left the Army, before, during, and after his presidency.<ref> Henry F.
