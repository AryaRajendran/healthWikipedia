==Nitroglycerin==

Nitroglycerin is used in the treatment of ACS/IHD to relieve anginal symptoms. It is associated with the decrease in myocardial stress due to peripheral vasodilation. The decrease of stress also decreases oxygen demand of the heart. The first line treatment for symptomatic relief of angina is sub-lingual nitroglycerin. Other formulations such as spray and IV can also be used.<ref name=AHA2007>{{cite journal |author=Anderson JL, Adams CD, Antman EM, ''et al.'' |title=ACC/AHA 2007 guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina/non ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Revise the 2002 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Unstable Angina/Non ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction): developed in collaboration with the American College of Emergency Physicians, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons: endorsed by the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation and the [[Society for Academic Emergency Medicine]] |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=7 |pages=e148–304 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17679616 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.181940 |url=}}</ref>  In the body nitroglycerin donates three nitric oxide molecules, which activate a second messenger system leading to release of calcium ions.

It should not be given to patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 90mmHg or 30mmHg or more below baseline.

==Beta Blockers==
β-blockers have been extensively studied in acute MI.  Despite thousands of studies, no consensus has yet been reached as to their efficacy in preventing complications or decreasing mortality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Logically this means that any treatment effect that exists is most likely small and risks and benefits of use in the ER should be weighed carefully. However, in theory β-blockers decrease the effect of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart. Since it is known that the sympathetic nervous system increases the heart rate and blood pressure in order to increase the cardiac output. Hence its blockage spares the heart the extra work load.

==Reperfusion==

They are therefore candidates for immediate reperfusion, either with [[thrombolysis|thrombolytic therapy]], [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI) or when these therapies are unsuccessful, [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].

Individuals without ST segment elevation are presumed to be experiencing either unstable angina (UA) or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). They receive many of the same initial therapies and are often stabilized with [[antiplatelet drug]]s and [[Anticoagulant|anticoagulated]]. If their condition remains ([[Hemodynamics|hemodynamically]]) stable, they can be offered either late [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] with subsequent restoration of blood flow (revascularization), or [[Minimally invasive procedure|non-invasive]] [[Cardiac stress test|stress testing]] to determine if there is significant ischemia that would benefit from revascularization.  If hemodynamic instability develops in individuals with NSTEMIs, they may undergo urgent coronary angiography and subsequent revascularization. The use of thrombolytic agents is contraindicated in this patient subset, however.<ref name="FTT_Lancet">{{cite journal | pmid = 7905143 | title = Indications for fibrinolytic therapy in suspected acute myocardial infarction: collaborative overview of early mortality and major morbidity results from all randomised trials of more than 1000 patients.

The basis for this distinction in treatment regimens is that ST segment elevations on an ECG are typically due to complete occlusion of a coronary artery. On the other hand, in NSTEMIs there is typically a sudden narrowing of a coronary artery with preserved (but diminished) flow to the distal myocardium. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents are given to prevent the narrowed artery from occluding.

At least 10% of patients with STEMI do not develop myocardial necrosis (as evidenced by a rise in cardiac markers) and subsequent Q waves on EKG after reperfusion therapy. Such a successful restoration of flow to the infarct-related artery during an acute myocardial infarction is known as "aborting" the myocardial infarction. If treated within the hour, about 25% of STEMIs can be aborted.<ref name=Verheught2006>{{cite journal | author = Verheugt FW, Gersh BJ, Armstrong PW | year = 2006 | title = Aborted myocardial infarction: a new target for reperfusion therapy | url = | journal = Eur Heart J | volume = 27 | issue = 8| pages = 901–4 | pmid = 16543251 | doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehi829}}</ref>

==Rehabilitation==
Additional objectives are to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias or conduction disturbances. This requires monitoring in a [[coronary care unit]] and protocolised administration of [[antiarrhythmic agent]]s.

==Special cases==

===Cocaine===
[[Cocaine]] associated myocardial infarction should be managed in a manner similar to other patients with acute coronary syndrome except [[beta blocker]]s should not be used and [[benzodiazepines]] should be administered early.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McCord J, Jneid H, Hollander JE, ''et al.'' |title=Management of cocaine-associated chest pain and myocardial infarction: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Acute Cardiac Care Committee of the Council on Clinical Cardiology |journal=Circulation |volume=117 |issue=14 |pages=1897–907 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18347214 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.188950 |url=}}</ref>  The treatment itself may have complications. If attempts to restore the blood flow are initiated after a critical period of only a few hours, the result may be a [[reperfusion injury]] instead of amelioration.<ref name=Faxon2005>{{cite journal | pmid = 16450811 | volume=28 | issue=11 Suppl 1 | journal = Clinical Cardiology | year=2005 | title = Coronary interventions and their impact on post myocardial infarction survival. | month=November | pages=I38–44 | author=Faxon DP}}</ref>

===Wilderness setting===
In [[wilderness first aid]], a possible heart attack justifies [[patient evacuation|evacuation]] by the fastest available means, often meaning the initiation of a [[MEDEVAC]]. The suspicion or provisional diagnosis of an MI means that it is inappropriate for the patient to walk out of the wilderness setting and will require them to be carried or conveyed in a vehicle.  Aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen can all be given with relative ease in a wilderness setting and should be administered as soon as possible in suspected cases of MI.  Wilderness management of [[Cardiac Arrest|cardiac arrest]] differs slightly from that carried out in an urban setting in that it is generally considered acceptable to terminate a resuscitation attempt after 30 minutes if there has been no change in the patient's condition.

===Air travel===
Certified personnel traveling by commercial aircraft may be able to assist an MI patient by using the on-board [[first aid kit]], which may contain some cardiac drugs (such as [[glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|glyceryl trinitrate]] spray, [[aspirin]], or [[opioid]] painkillers), an AED,<ref>{{cite web|last=Youngwith|first=Janice|title=Saving hearts in the air|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/special/americanheartmonth/2008/index.asp?id=11|publisher=Dailyherald.com|date=2008-02-06|accessdate=2008-06-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and [[oxygen]]. Pilots may divert the flight to land at a nearby airport. [[Cardiac monitors]] are being introduced by some airlines, and they can be used by both on-board and ground-based physicians.<ref name=aircraft>{{cite journal | pmid = 11090520 | volume=321 | issue=7272 | journal = BMJ (Clinical research ed.) | year=2000 | title = "Is there a doctor on the aircraft?"
