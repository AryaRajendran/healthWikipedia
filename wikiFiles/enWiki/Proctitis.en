'''Proctitis''' is an [[inflammation]] of the [[anus]] and the lining of the [[rectum]], affecting only the last 6&nbsp;inches of the rectum.

==Overview==
Symptoms are ineffectual straining to empty the bowels, [[diarrhea]], [[Hematochezia|rectal bleeding]] and possible discharge, a feeling of not having adequately emptied the bowels, involuntary spasms and cramping during bowel movements, left-sided abdominal pain, passage of mucus through the rectum, and anorectal pain.

==Causes==

Proctitis has many possible causes. It may occur idiopathically (idiopathic proctitis). Other causes include damage by irradiation (for example in radiation therapy for [[cervical cancer]] and prostate cancer) or as a [[sexually transmitted infection]], as in [[lymphogranuloma venereum]] and [[herpes proctitis]]. Proctitis is also linked to stress {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} and recent studies suggest a celiac disease-associated "proctitis" can result from an intolerance to [[gluten]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mazzarella|first=G|coauthors=Paparo, F; Maglio, M; Troncone, R|title=Organ culture of rectal mucosa : in vitro challenge with gluten in celiac disease|journal=Methods Mol Med|year=2000|volume=41|pages=163–73|pmid=21374439|doi=10.1385/1-59259-082-9:163}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ensari|first=A|coauthors=Marsh, MN; Loft, DE; Morgan, S; Moriarty, K|title=Morphometric analysis of intestinal mucosa.

==Symptoms==
A common symptom is a continual urge to have a bowel movement—the rectum could feel full or have constipation. Another is tenderness and mild irritation in the rectum and anal region. A serious symptom is pus and blood in the [[Rectal discharge|discharge]], accompanied by cramps and pain during the bowel movement. If there is severe bleeding, a condition called [[anemia]] can also be caused, showing symptoms such as pale skin, irritability, weakness, dizziness, brittle nails, and shortness of breath.

===Sexually transmitted proctitis===
'''[[Gonorrhea]]''' <small>(Gonococcal proctitis)</small>
:This is the most common cause. Strongly associated with anal intercourse. Symptoms include soreness, itching, bloody or pus-like [[Rectal discharge|discharge]], or [[diarrhea]]. Other rectal problems that may be present are anal warts, anal tears, [[fistula]]s, and [[hemorrhoids]].

'''[[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]]''' <small>(chlamydia proctitis)</small>
:Accounts for twenty percent of cases. People may show no symptoms, mild symptoms, or severe symptoms. Mild symptoms include rectal pain with bowel movements, [[rectal discharge]], and cramping. With severe cases, people may have discharge containing blood or pus, severe rectal pain, and [[diarrhea]]. Some people suffer from rectal strictures, a narrowing of the rectal passageway. The narrowing of the passageway may cause constipation, straining, and thin stools.

'''[[Herpes Simplex Virus|Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2]]''' <small>(herpes proctitis)</small>
:Symptoms may include multiple vesicles that rupture to form ulcers, [[tenesmus]], rectal pain, [[Rectal discharge|discharge]], [[hematochezia]]. The disease may run its natural course of [[exacerbation]]s and [[remission]]s but is usually more prolonged and severe in patients with immunodeficiency disorders. Presentations may resemble [[dermatitis]] or [[decubitus]] ulcers in debilitated, bedridden patients. A secondary bacterial infection may be present.

'''[[Syphilis]]''' <small>(syphilitic proctitis)</small>
:The symptoms are similar to other causes of infectious proctitis; rectal pain, [[Rectal discharge|discharge]], and spasms during bowel movements, but some people may have no symptoms. Syphilis occurs in three stages.
:*The primary stage: One painless sore, less than an inch across, with raised borders found at the site of sexual contact, and during acute stages of infection, the lymph nodes in the groin become diseased, firm, and rubbery.
:*The secondary stage: A contagious diffuse rash that may appear over the entire body, particularly on the hands and feet.
:*The third stage: Occurs late in the course of syphilis and affects mostly the heart and nervous system.

==Diagnosis==
Doctors can diagnose proctitis by looking inside the rectum with a [[proctoscope]] or a [[sigmoidoscope]]. A [[biopsy]] is taken, in which the doctor scrapes a tiny piece of tissue from the rectum, and this tissue is then examined by microscopy. The physician may also take a stool sample to test for infections or bacteria. If the physician suspects that the patient suffers from Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, colonoscopy or barium [[enema]] X-rays are used to examine areas of the intestine.

==Treatment==
Treatment for proctitis varies depending on severity and the cause. For example, the physician may prescribe antibiotics for proctitis caused by bacterial infection. If the proctitis is caused by Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, the physician may prescribe the drug [[Mesalazine|5-aminosalicyclic acid]] (5ASA) or [[corticosteroid]]s applied directly to the area in enema or [[suppository]] form, or taken orally in pill form. Enema and suppository applications are usually more effective, but some patients may require a combination of oral and rectal applications.

Another treatment available is that of fiber supplements such as [[Metamucil]].  Taken daily these may restore regularity and reduce pain associated with proctitis.
