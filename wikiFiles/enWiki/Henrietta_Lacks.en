==Biography==
===Early life (1920–1940)===
Henrietta Lacks was born '''Loretta Pleasant''' on August 1, 1920<ref name="vpbio"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Skloot|2010|p=18}}</ref> in [[Roanoke, Virginia]], to Eliza (1886–1924)<ref>Eliza was born on July 12, 1886.

Henrietta's father felt unable to handle the children, so he took them all to [[Clover, Virginia]] and distributed the children among relatives. Henrietta, nicknamed Hennie, ended up with her grandfather, Tommy Lacks.<ref name="vpbio"/>

===Later life (1941–1950)===
Pleasant [[cousin marriage|married her first cousin]], David "Day" Lacks (1915–2002), in [[Halifax County, Virginia]]. David had already been living with Henrietta's grandfather when she moved there at age 4. Their marriage occurred on April 10, 1941, after their first two children were born, the first when Henrietta was 14. 

At the end of 1941, their cousin Fred Garret convinced the Lacks couple to leave the tobacco farm and have Day work at Bethlehem Steel's Sparrow's Point steel mill. Soon, they moved—Day first, then Henrietta and their two oldest children, Lawrence and Lucile Elsie Pleasant (Elsie)—to Maryland. David bought a house for the family with the money Garret gave Day when he left to go overseas. Their house was on New Pittsburgh Avenue in Turner Station, now a part of [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]], [[Baltimore County]], [[Maryland]]. This community was one of the largest<ref name="bcrecord">{{cite web|url=http://resources.baltimorecountymd.gov/Documents/Planning/historic/survey_districts/turners_station.pdf|title=Turner's Station African American Survey District, Dundalk, Baltimore County 1900–1950|format=PDF|publisher=[[Baltimore County]]|accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref><ref name="aathematic">{{cite web|url=http://resources.baltimorecountymd.gov/Documents/Planning/historic/aathematic.pdf|format=PDF|title=Baltimore county architectural survey African American Thematic Study|publisher=Baltimore County Office of Planning and The Landmarks Preservation Commission|accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> and one of the youngest<ref name=aathematic /> of the approximately forty [[African American]] communities in Baltimore County.

Day and Henrietta had five children together: Lawrence (b. 1935), Elsie (1939–1955), David "Sonny" Jr. (b. 1947), Deborah (1949–2009), and Joseph (b. 1950, later changed name to Zakariyya Bari Abdul Rahman). Joseph Lacks, Henrietta's last child, was born at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in November 1950, just four and a half months before Henrietta was diagnosed with cancer.<ref name="vpbio"/> Elsie was described by the family as "different", "deaf and dumb" and in 1955 died in the Hospital for the Negro Insane (which was later renamed [[Crownsville Hospital Center]] and was also known as Crownsville State Hospital). Elsie had been placed there about 1950, around the same time Henrietta discovered that she had lumps and unusual bleeding.<ref name="vpbio"/>

===Diagnosis and death (1951)===
On January 29, 1951, Henrietta went to [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] because she felt a knot inside her. It all started when she asked her cousins to feel her belly, asking if they felt the lump that she did. Her cousins assumed correctly that she was pregnant. But, after giving birth to her fifth child, Joseph, Henrietta started bleeding abnormally and profusely. Her local doctor tested her for [[syphilis]], which came back negative, and referred her to Johns Hopkins.

Johns Hopkins was their only choice for a hospital, since it was the only one in proximity to them that treated black patients. Howard Jones, her new doctor, examined Henrietta and the lump in her [[cervix]]. It was like nothing he had ever seen before. He cut off a small part of the tumor and sent it to the pathology lab. Soon after, Jones discovered she had a malignant [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|epidermoid carcinoma]] of the cervix Stage 1 (cervical cancer).

Lacks was [[Radiation treatment|treated with radium tube inserts]], which were sewn in place. After several days in place, the tubes were removed and she was released from Johns Hopkins with instructions to return for X-ray treatments as a follow-up. During her radiation treatments for the tumor, two samples of Henrietta's cervix were removed— a healthy part and a cancerous part— without her permission.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skloot|2010|p=33}}</ref> The cells from her cervix were given to Dr. [[George Otto Gey]]. These cells would eventually become the [[HeLa]] [[Cell culture#Concepts in mammalian cell culture|immortal cell line]], a commonly used [[cell line]] in [[biomedical research]].<ref name="vpbio"/>

In significant pain and without improvement, Lacks returned to Hopkins on August 8th for a treatment session, but asked to be admitted. She remained at the hospital until the day of her death.<ref name="vpbio"/> Though she received treatment and blood transfusions, she died of [[uremic poisoning]] on October 4, 1951 at the age of thirty-one.<ref name="Baltimore City News" /> A subsequent partial [[autopsy]] showed that the cancer had [[metastasized]] throughout her entire body.<ref name="vpbio"/>

Henrietta Lacks was buried without a tombstone in a family cemetery in Lackstown, a part of [[Clover, Virginia|Clover]] in [[Halifax County, Virginia]]. Her exact burial location is not known, although the family believes it is within feet of her mother's gravesite.<ref name="vpbio"/> Lackstown is the name of the land that has been held by the (black) Lacks family since they received it from the (white) Lacks family, who had owned the ancestors of the black Lackses when slavery was legal. Many members of the black Lacks family were also descended from the white Lacks family. A row of [[Buxus|boxwoods]] separates the graves of whites from those of the blacks buried in the family cemetery.<ref name="vpbio"/> For decades, Henrietta Lacks' mother had the only tombstone of the five graves in the family cemetery in Lackstown, and Henrietta's own grave was unmarked. <ref name="Baltimore City News">{{cite news |first=Van |last=Smith |title=Wonder Woman: The Life, Death, and Life After Death of Henrietta Lacks, Unwitting Heroine of Modern Medical Science|url=http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3426 |newspaper=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |date=2002-04-17 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref><ref name=JHM2000>{{cite web |url=http://www.jhu.edu/~jhumag/0400web/01.html | author=[[Rebecca Skloot|Skloot, Rebecca]] |title=Henrietta's Dance |accessdate=2012-08-19 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]|date=April 2000}}</ref> In 2010, however, Dr. Roland Pattillo of the [[Morehouse School of Medicine]] donated a headstone for Lacks after reading ''[[The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]]''. <ref name="scienceblogs1">{{cite web|last=Skloot |first=Rebecca |url=http://scienceblogs.com/culturedish/2010/05/29/a-historic-day-henrietta-lacks/ |title=A Historic Day: Henrietta Lacks’s Long Unmarked Grave Finally Gets a Headstone – Culture Dish |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |date=2010-05-29 |accessdate=2012-12-21}}</ref> The headstone, which is shaped like a book, reads:

==Legacy==
===In scientific research===
{{See also|HeLa}}
The cells from Henrietta's tumor were given to researcher [[George Gey]], who "discovered that [Henrietta's] cells did something they'd never seen before: They could be kept alive and grow."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/womans-cells-changed-medicine/story?id=9712579| title=How One Woman's Cells Changed Medicine|accessdate=2012-08-19 | last1=Claiborne| first1=Ron| last2= Wright IV| first2=Sydney |publisher=[[ABC World News]]| date=2010-01-31}}</ref> Before this, cells cultured from other cells would only survive for a few days. Scientists spent more time trying to keep the cells alive than performing actual research on the cells but some cells from Lacks's tumor sample behaved differently than others. George Gey was able to isolate one specific cell, multiply it, and start a cell line. Gey named the sample [[HeLa]], after the initial letters of Henrietta Lacks' name. As the first human cells grown in a lab that were "immortal" (they do not die after a few cell divisions), they could be used for conducting many experiments. This represented an enormous boon to medical and biological research.<ref name="vpbio"/>

As reporter [[Michael A. Rogers|Michael Rogers]] stated, the growth of HeLa by a researcher at the hospital helped answer the demands of the 10,000 who marched for a cure to [[polio]] shortly before Lacks' death. By 1954, the HeLa strain of cells was being used by [[Jonas Salk]] to develop a [[polio vaccine|vaccine for polio]].<ref name="vpbio"/><ref name="Baltimore City News"/> To test Salk's new vaccine, the cells were quickly put into mass production in the first-ever cell production factory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skloot|2010|p=96}}</ref>

Demand for the HeLa cells quickly grew. Since they were put into mass production, Henrietta's cells have been mailed to scientists around the globe for "research into [[cancer]], [[AIDS]], the effects of radiation and toxic substances, [[gene mapping]], and countless other scientific pursuits".<ref name="Baltimore City News"/> HeLa cells have been used to test human sensitivity to tape, glue, cosmetics, and many other products.<ref name="vpbio"/> Scientists have grown some 20 tons of her cells,<ref name="vpbio"/><ref>Margonelli, Lisa, "Eternal Life", ''The New York Times'', February 5, 2010</ref> and there are almost 11,000 patents involving HeLa cells.<ref name="vpbio"/>

In the early 1970s, the family of Henrietta Lacks started getting calls from researchers who wanted blood samples from them to learn the family's genetics (eye colors, hair colors, and genetic connections). The family questioned this, which led to them learning about the removal of Henrietta's cells.<ref name="vpbio"/>

===Recognition===
In 1996, [[Morehouse School of Medicine]] in [[Atlanta]], the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and the mayor of Atlanta recognized the late Henrietta Lacks' family for her [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous contributions]] to medicine and health research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msm.edu/exec_offices/office_marketing/msmnews/news2009/09-08-24/Morehouse_School_of_Medicine_Hosts_14th_Annual_HeLa_Women%E2%80%99s_Health_Conference.aspx|title=Morehouse School of Medicine Hosts 14th Annual HeLa Women's Health Conference |work=MSM News |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref>

Her life was commemorated annually by Turner Station residents for a few years after Morehouse's commemoration. A congressional resolution in her honor was presented by [[Robert Ehrlich]] following soon after the first commemoration of her, her family, and her contributions to science in Turner Station.

Events in the Turner Station's community have also commemorated the contributions of others including Mary Kubicek, the laboratory assistant who discovered that HeLa cells lived outside the body, as well as Dr. Gey and his nurse wife, Margaret Gey, who together after over 20 years of attempts were eventually able to grow human cells outside of the body.<ref name="vpbio"/>

In 2011, [[Morgan State University]] granted her a posthumous honorary degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.morganstatenewsroom.com/2011/05/21/congratulations-class-of-2011/ |title=Morgan Celebrates More than 1,200 Degree Recipients |date=2011-05-21 |publisher=[[Morgan State University]] |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref>

On September 14, 2011, the Board of Directors of Washington ESD 114 [[Evergreen School District]] chose to name a new health and bioscience high school in her honor. The new school, scheduled to open in the fall of 2013, will be named [[Henrietta Lacks Health and Bioscience High School]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Buck|first=Howard|title=Bioscience school gets official name|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2011/sep/14/bioscience-school-gets-official-name/ |newspaper=[[The Columbian]] |date=2011-09-14|accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref>  "It is such an honor to name our new school after a person who so impacted the world of medicine and science," said school board member Victoria Bradford, who also served on the naming committee. "It is also a privilege to be the first organization to publicly memorialize Henrietta Lacks by naming this school building after her."<ref>{{cite web|title=New high school name to honor Henrietta Lacks|url=http://downtownvancouver.katu.com/news/arts-culture/442971-new-high-school-name-honor-henrietta-lacks|publisher=[[KATU]]|accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref>

October 11, in Atlanta, Georgia, is Henrietta Lacks' Day.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

===In media===
In 1998, a one-hour [[BBC]] documentary<ref>{{cite web|url=http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-way-of-all-flesh/ |title=The Way of All Flesh|accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{google video|8448974573505946013|The Way of All Flesh by Adam Curtis}}</ref> on Lacks and HeLa directed by [[Adam Curtis]], won the Best Science and Nature Documentary at the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]]. Immediately following the film's airing in 1997, an article on HeLa cells, Lacks, and her family was published by reporter Jacques Kelly in ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. In the 1990s, the ''Dundalk Eagle'' published the first article on her in a newspaper in Baltimore City and Baltimore County, and it continues to announce upcoming local commemorative activities. The Lacks family was also honored at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref name="smithsonian">{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Henrietta-Lacks-Immortal-Cells.html|title=Henrietta Lacks' 'Immortal' Cells|last=Zielinski|first=Sarah|date=2010-01-22 |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> In 2001, it was announced that the [[National Foundation for Cancer Research]] would be honoring "the late Henrietta Lacks for the contributions made to cancer research and modern medicine" on September 14. Because of the events of [[September 11, 2001]], the event was canceled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skloot|2010|p=299}}</ref>

In articles published in 2000 <ref>[http://www.jhu.edu/jhumag/0400web/01.html Henrietta's Dance], Johns Hopkins Magazine, April 2000</ref> and 2001<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/17/arts/cells-that-save-lives-are-a-mother-s-legacy.html Cells That Save Lives are a Mother's Legacy], New York Times, November 17, 2001</ref> and in her 2010 book, ''[[The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]]'', [[Rebecca Skloot]] documents the histories of both the HeLa cell line and the Lacks family. Henrietta's husband, David Lacks, was told little following her death. Suspicions fueled by racial issues prevalent in the South (see [[Night Doctors]]) were compounded by issues of class and education. For their part, members of the Lacks family were kept in the dark about the existence of the tissue line. When its existence was revealed in two articles written in March 1976 by [[Michael A. Rogers|Michael Rogers]], one in the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''<ref name="Free Press">{{cite news|title=The HeLa Strain|author=[[Michael A.

In 2000 [[Mal Webb]] released a CD<ref>{{cite web|title=CDs (Mal Webb)|url=http://malwebb.customer.netspace.net.au/cds.html|publisher=MalWebb.Com|accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> with a song about Lacks called ''Helen Lane''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Webb|first=Mal|title=Helen Lane|url=http://malwebb.customer.netspace.net.au/hela.html|publisher=MalWebb.Com|accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref>

In May 2010, ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'' published two articles on Lacks, HeLa, and her family,<ref name="vpbio"/><ref name="vpbio2">{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2010/05/after-60-years-anonymity-henrietta-lacks-has-headstone|title=After 60 years of anonymity, Henrietta Lacks has a headstone|last=Batts|first=Denise Watson|date=2010-05-30|work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]|pages=HR1,7|accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> which mentions that the Morehouse School of Medicine has donated the money for Henrietta's grave as well as her daughter Elsie, who died in 1955, to finally have headstones. Her grandchildren wrote her epitaph: "Henrietta Lacks {{sic|hide=y|August 01, 1920 – October 04, 1951}} In loving memory of a phenomenal woman, wife and mother who touched the lives of many.

In May 2010, [[HBO]] announced that [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]] would develop a film project based on Skloot's book.<ref name="vpbio2"/>

On May 17, 2010, NBC ran a fictionalized version of Lacks' story on ''[[Law & Order]]'', titled "Immortal". An article in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' called the episode "shockingly close to the true story."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/content/slate/blogs/browbeat/2010/05/19/ripped_from_which_headline_immortal.html |title=Ripped From Which Headline?

On May 31, 2011 [[Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine]] released the CD [[Enhanced Methods of Questioning ]] with a song about Henrietta Lacks and the HeLa immortal cell line called "The Cells That Will Not Die".

In May of 2012, self-proclaimed "Middle Eastern-psych-snap-gospel" band [[Yeasayer]] officially released "Henrietta", the first single from their third album "Fragrant World". Lead singer Chris Keating reports that Henrietta Lacks' legacy inspired the creation of this song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/yeasayer/63816|title=Yeasayer reveal new track 'Henrietta' – listen|date=2012-05-16|publisher=[[NME]]}}</ref>
