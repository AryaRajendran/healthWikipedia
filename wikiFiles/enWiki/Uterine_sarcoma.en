A '''uterine sarcoma''' is a malignant tumor that arises from the [[smooth muscle]] or [[connective tissue]] of the [[uterus]]. 

==Histology==
Subtypes include [[leiomyosarcoma]]s, [[endometrial stromal sarcoma]]s, [[carcinosarcoma]]s and "other" sarcomas.<ref name="pmid19356236">{{cite journal |author=Zagouri F, Dimopoulos AM, Fotiou S, Kouloulias V, Papadimitriou CA |title=Treatment of early uterine sarcomas: disentangling adjuvant modalities |journal=World J Surg Oncol |volume=7 |issue= |pages=38 |year=2009 |pmid=19356236 |pmc=2674046 |doi=10.1186/1477-7819-7-38 |url=http://www.wjso.com/content/7//38}}</ref>

* If the lesion originates from the stroma of the [[uterine lining]] it is an endometrial stromal sarcoma.
* If the uterine [[muscle]] cell is the originator the tumor is a uterine leiomyosarcoma.
* Carcinosarcomas comprise both malignant epithelial and malignant sarcomatous components.

==Classification==
[[Leiomyosarcoma]]s are now staged using the 2009 FIGO staging system<ref>http://www.ijgo.org/article/S0020-7292%2809%2900202-1/fulltext</ref> (previously they were staged like endometrial carcinomas)  at time of surgery.
*Stage I: tumor is limited to the uterus
:IA: ≤5 cm in greatest dimension
:IB: >5 cm
*Stage II: tumor extends beyond the uterus, but within the pelvis
:IIA: involves [[adnexa of uterus]]
:IIB: involves other pelvic tissues
*Stage III: tumor infiltrates abdominal tissues
:IIIA: 1 site
:IIIB: >1 site
:IIIC: regional lymph node metastasis
*Stage IVA: invades bladder or rectum
*Stage IVB: distant metastasis (including intraabdominal or inguinal lymph nodes; excluding adnexa, pelvic and abdominal tissues)

[[Endometrial stromal sarcoma]]s and [[uterine adenosarcoma]]s are classified as above, with the exception of different classifications for Stage I tumors.
*Stage I: tumor is limited to the uterus
:IA: limited to endometrium/endocervix
:IB: invades <½ myometrium
:IC: invades ≥½ myometrium

Finally, [[Mixed Müllerian tumor|malignant mixed Müllerian tumors]], a type of [[carcinosarcoma]], are staged similarly to endometrial carcinomas.<ref>http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/endometrial/HealthProfessional/page3</ref>
*Stage I: tumor is limited to the uterus
:IA: invades <½ myometrium
:IB: invades ≥½ myometrium
*Stage II: invades cervical stroma, but no extension beyond the uterus
*Stage III: local and/or regional spread
:IIIA: invades uterine serosa and/or adnexa
:IIIB: vaginal and/or parametrial involvement
:IIIC: metastases to pelvic and/or [paraaortic lymph node]s
::IIIC1: positive pelvic nodes
::IIIC2: positive para-aortic lymph nodes
*Stage IVA: invades bladder and/or bowel mucosa
*Stage IVB: distant metastases (including intra-abdominal metastases and/or inguinal lymph nodes)

==Signs and Symptoms==
Unusual or postmenopausal bleeding may be a sign of a malignancy including uterine sarcoma and needs to be investigated. Other signs include pelvic pain, pressure, and unusual discharge.  A nonpregnant uterus that enlarges quickly is suspicious. However, none of the signs are specific. Specific screening test have not been developed; a [[Pap smear]] is a screening test for [[cervical cancer]] and not designed to detect uterine sarcoma.  

==Diagnosis==
Investigations by the physician include imaging ([[ultrasound]], [[CAT scan]], [[MRI]]) and, if possible, obtaining a tissue diagnosis by [[biopsy]], [[hysteroscopy]], or [[Dilation and curettage|D&C]]. 
Ultimately the diagnosis is established by the histologic examination of the specimen. Typically malignant lesions have >10 [[mitosis]] per high power field. In contrast a [[uterine leiomyoma]] as a benign lesion would have < 5 mitosis per high power field.

==Management==
Therapy is based on staging and patient condition and utilizes one or more of the following approaches.
[[Surgery]] is the mainstay of therapy if feasible involving total abdominal [[hysterectomy]] with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Other approaches include [[radiation therapy]], [[chemotherapy]], and [[hormonal therapy]].

The vast majority of malignancies of the uterine body are [[endometrial cancer|endometrial carcinomas]] - only about 4% will be uterine sarcomas.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/cri/cri_2_3x.asp?dt=63]  [[American Cancer Society]] information, accessed 03-11-2006</ref> Generally, the cause of the lesion is not known, however patients with a history of pelvic radiation are at higher risk. Most tumors occur after [[menopause]].
Women who take long-term [[tamoxifen]] are at higher risk.<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/uterinesarcoma] [[National Cancer Institute]] information, accessed 03-11-2006</ref>
