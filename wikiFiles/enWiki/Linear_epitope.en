[[File:Schematic diagram showing Polyclonal Response by B cells against Linear Epitopes.PNG|thumb|300px| Recognition of epitopes in a linear fashion. Note: the same (colored) segment of protein can be a part of more than one epitopes]] 

A '''linear or a sequential epitope''' is an [[epitope]] that is recognized by [[antibody|antibodies]] by its linear sequence of [[amino acid]]s, or [[primary structure]]. In contrast, most antibodies recognize a [[conformational epitope]] that has a specific three-dimensional shape and its [[protein structure]].

An antigen is any substance that the [[immune system]] can recognize as being foreign and which provokes an immune response. Since, antigens are usually proteins that are too large to bind as a whole to any [[Receptor (immunology)|receptor]], only specific segments that form the antigen bind with a specific antibody. Such segments are called [[epitope]]s. Likewise, it is only [[paratope]] of the antibody that comes in contact with the epitope.

[[Protein]]s are composed of repeating [[nitrogen]]-containing subunits called [[amino acid]]s. The linear sequence of amino acids that compose a protein is called its [[primary structure]], which does not exist in nature. But, when an antigen is broken down in a [[lysosome]], it yields small [[peptide]]s, which can be recognized through the amino acids that lie continuously in a line, and hence are called ''linear epitopes''.<ref name=goldsby3>{{cite book

== Significance ==
While performing molecular assays involving use of antibodies such as in the [[Western blot]], [[immunohistochemistry]], and [[ELISA]], one should carefully choose antibodies that recognize linear or conformational epitopes.<sup><ref>[http://www.emdbiosciences.com/html/CBC/technical-tips-immunochemical-applications.html EMD - Calbiochem: Technical Tips/Immunochemical Applications<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></sup> 

For instance, if a [[protein]] sample is boiled, treated with [[beta-mercaptoethanol]], and run in [[SDS-PAGE]] for the Western blot, the proteins are essentially [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] and therefore cannot assume their natural three-dimensional conformations. Therefore, antibodies that recognize linear epitopes instead of conformational epitopes are chosen for immunodetection. In contrast, in immunohistochemistry where protein structure is preserved, antibodies are preferred that recognize conformational epitopes.
