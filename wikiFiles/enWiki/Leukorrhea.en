'''Leukorrhea''' (US) or '''leucorrhoea''' (Commonwealth) is a medical term that denotes a thick, whitish or yellowish [[vaginal discharge]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|five/000058899|leukorrhea}}</ref> 
There are many causes of leukorrhea, the usual one being [[estrogen]] imbalance. The amount of discharge may increase due to [[vaginal infection]] or [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], and also it may disappear and reappear from time to time, this discharge can keep occurring for years in which case it becomes more yellow and foul-smelling; it is usually a non-pathological symptom secondary to [[inflammation|inflammatory]] conditions of vagina or [[cervix]]. 

Vaginal discharge is not abnormal, and causes of change in discharge include infection, malignancy, and hormonal changes. It sometimes occurs before a girl has her first [[menstruation|period]], and is considered a sign of [[puberty]].

==Physiologic leukorrhea==
It is not a major issue but is to be resolved as soon as possible. It can be a natural defense mechanism that the vagina uses to maintain its chemical balance, as well as to preserve the flexibility of the vaginal tissue. The term "physiologic leukorrhea" is used to refer to leukorrhea due to estrogen stimulation.<ref name="isbn1-4160-0159-X">{{cite book |author=Behrman, Richard E.; Kliegman, Robert; Karen Marcdante; Jenson, Hal B. |title=Nelson essentials of pediatrics |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2006 |pages=348 |isbn=1-4160-0159-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Leukorrhea may occur normally during [[pregnancy]]. This is caused by increased bloodflow to the vagina due to increased estrogen. Female [[infant]]s may have leukorrhea for a short time after birth due to their in-uterine exposure to estrogen.

==Inflammatory leukorrhea==
It may also result from [[inflammation]] or congestion of the vaginal [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]]. In cases where it is yellowish or gives off an odor, a doctor should be consulted since it could be a sign of several disease processes, including an organic bacterial infection or [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]].

After [[Childbirth|delivery]], leukorrhea accompanied by backache and foul-smelling [[lochia]] ([[post-partum]] vaginal discharge, containing blood, mucus, and [[placenta]]l tissue) may suggest the failure of [[Involution (medicine)|involution]] (the [[uterus]] returning to pre-pregnancy size) due to infection.
Investigations: [[wet smear]], [[Gram stain]], culture, [[pap smear]] and biopsy.
