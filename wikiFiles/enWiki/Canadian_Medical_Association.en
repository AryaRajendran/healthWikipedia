The '''Canadian Medical Association''' (CMA), with more than 70,000{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} members, is the largest association of [[Medical doctor|doctor]]s in [[Canada]] and works to represent their interests nationally.  It formed in 1867, three months after [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]]. The CMA is a Canadian civilian organization with the [[Royal Patronage]] of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

The CMA publishes the [[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] (CMAJ) and through accreditation of educational programs works to ensure national standards in health care. The CMA also publishes a magazine called Canadian Health.<ref>http://www.canada-health-insurance.com/canadian-medical-association.html</ref>

The CMA was also the driving force behind the creation of the [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan]] in 1957.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Today, its financial arm, MD Management, administers more than [[Canadian dollar|$]]21 billion for CMA members and their families. It is the only professional association in the world to have enjoyed such success.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}{{POV-check|date=March 2013}} The CMA also owns and operates a profit-making business called Practice Solutions, created in 2005 and claiming to offer end-to-end technology and practice management services to its members.

It claims to represent the interests of patients nationally and actively lobbies the [[Canadian government]] on [[public health]] issues.<ref name="cma_oph">CMA. [http://www.cma.ca/index.cfm/ci_id/3428/la_id/1.htm CMA Office for public health].  Accessed: 4 September 2005.</ref>

In the past, the CMA strongly supported the current [[Medicare (Canada)|single payer health care system]]. But, this recently changed with the CMA's support of private health insurance, following the recent [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruling on [[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)|Chaoulli and Quebec]].<ref name="sibbald">Sibbald B. CMA supports private health insurance. [[CMAJ]]. 2005 Aug 18; {{DOI|10.1503/cmaj.051035}} PMID 16109752 [http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/rapidpdf/cmaj.051035v1.pdf Full Text]</ref>

== Awareness campaigns ==
In 2008, CMA launched an advocacy campaign to put Canada's [[doctor shortage]] on the federal political agenda.  The campaign, which claimed that over 5 million Canadians had no access to a family doctor and that Canada needed 26,000 more physicians to meet the average in most other industrialized countries,<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/01/09/doctors-survey.html</ref> was designed by [[Ottawa]] creative agency [[McMillan integrated marketing]].
