The '''stratum spinosum''' (or '''spinous layer''') is a layer of the [[epidermis_(skin)|epidermis]] found between the [[stratum granulosum]] and [[Stratum germinativum|stratum basale]].<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005) ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology'' (10th ed.). Saunders. Page 2. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>  This layer is also referred to as the "spinous" or "prickle-cell" layer.<ref name="Rooks">McGrath, J.A.; Eady, R.A.; Pope, F.M. (2004). ''Rook's Textbook of Dermatology'' (Seventh Edition). Blackwell Publishing. Pages 3.7-3.8. ISBN 978-0-632-06429-8.</ref>  This appearance is due to [[desmosome|desmosomal]] connections of adjacent cells. [[Keratinization]] begins in the stratum spinosum.<ref name="Lookingbill">Marks, James G; Miller, Jeffery (2006). ''Lookingbill and Marks' Principles of Dermatology'' (4th ed.). Elsevier Inc. Page 6. ISBN 1-4160-3185-5.</ref> This layer is composed of polyhedral keratinocytes, they have large pale staining nuclei as they are active in synthesizing fibrilar proteins, known as cytokeratin, which build up within the cells aggregating together forming [[tonofibrils]]. The [[tonofibrils]] go on to form the desmosomes allowing strong connections to form between adjacent keratinocytes.
