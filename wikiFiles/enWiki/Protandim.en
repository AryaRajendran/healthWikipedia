== Product History==
In 2003, Lifeline Therapeutics, a privately held Denver-based nutraceutical licensing and marketing company, entered into a joint agreement with Massachusetts biotechnology company CereMedix for the rights to market CMX-1152, an experimental [[peptide]]-based [[chemical compound|compound]], under the brand name "Protandim" (also sometimes referred to at that time as "Rholen," "Rejuven8r" and "ependymin").<ref name=NutraceuticalsWorld>{{cite news|title=Lifeline Nutraceuticals, CereMedix sign agreement|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112356866.html|accessdate=08/19/2012|newspaper=Nutraceuticals World|date=December 1, 2003}}</ref><ref name=BetterhumansPR>{{cite news|title=The Uncertain Antiaging Pill (press release)|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2004/12/prweb183718.htm|accessdate=08/19/2012|newspaper=Betterhumans|date=December 1, 2004}}</ref><ref name="McCook"/><ref name=PR101603>{{cite news|title=LifeLine Therapeutics press release|url=http://www.cryonics.org/immortalist/january04/lifeline.htm|accessdate=08/19/2012|date=October 16, 2003}}</ref><ref name=Betterhumans>{{cite news|last=Bailey|first=Patrick|title=The Uncertain Antiaging Pill|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20041204092646/http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Reports/report.aspx?articleID=2004-11-29-1|accessdate=11/29/2004|newspaper=Betterhumans}}</ref><ref name=Scotsman>{{cite news|title=Scientist returns to build long-life pill plant|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scientist-returns-to-build-long-life-pill-plant-1-894387|accessdate=08/20/2012|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=November 17, 2003}}</ref><ref name=DenverPost>{{cite news|last=Austin|first=Marsha|title=Denver Businessmen Gamble on Selling Fountain of Youth in Pill Form|url=http://business.highbeam.com/3563/article-1G1-111038316/denver-businessmen-gamble-selling-fountain-youth-pill|accessdate=08/20/2012|newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=December 8, 2003}}</ref> CereMedix was a ten percent owner of Lifeline and members of the CereMedix management board served on Lifeline’s board of directors.

CMX-1152 was due to be marketed as an [[over the counter]] [[anti-aging]] pill in June 2004 after completing human clinical trials. However, plans to market the CMX-152 version of Protandim fell through and in April 2004 Lifeline Therapeutics announced that it would instead be marketing a different (non-peptide) [[dietary supplement]] under the name “Protandim CF” (to distinguish it from the peptide version initially developed by Cermedix). The new version of Protandim, a combination of 5 common [[herbal]] ingredients including [[turmeric]] and [[green tea]] was invented following “months of extensive research and development” by Lifeline employees Paul Myhill and William Driscoll (a former oil company executive), who together hold the patent on the product,<ref name=Patent1>{{Cite patent | inventor1-last=Myhill | inventor1-first=Paul R. | inventor2-last=Driscoll | inventor2-first=William J. | issue-date=10 July 2007 | patent-number=7241461 | title=Composition for alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress in a mammal. | postscript=<!--None--> | country-code=US }}</ref> and it was officially launched in February 2005.

Like CMX-1152, the herbal version of Protandim that supplanted it was marketed by Lifeline as an "anti-aging" supplement that increases the body’s antioxidant defenses by upregulating superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. According to the company, the product was initially sold through retail channels such as [[GNC (store)|GNC]];<ref name=GNC>{{cite news|title=Protandim to be Available at General Nutrition Center (GNC) Stores|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/849146/000102189005000106/lifeline720058kex99.htm|accessdate=08/19/2012|newspaper=Lifeline Therapeutics press release|date=July 20, 2005}}</ref> however, in 2009, after several consecutive years of multimillion dollar losses, the company, which by then was doing business under the name LifeVantage, stopped marketing Protandim through retailers and switched to multilevel marketing, selling it instead through a network of commissioned independent distributors exclusively. According to LifeVantage, the move from retail to multi-level marketing was prompted by the January 2008 hiring of David W. Brown, (formerly CEO and president of [[Metabolife]]) as the company's CEO and president.<ref name=ReutersBrown>{{cite news|title=LifeVantage Corporation Appoints Industry Veteran David Brown as President & CEO (LFVN press release)|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/01/14/idUS120817+14-Jan-2008+PRN20080114|accessdate=08/24/2012|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=January 14, 2008}}</ref><ref name=LFVNstory>{{cite web|title=The LifeVantage Story|url=http://www.lifevantage.com/company/our-story/|publisher=LifeVantage, Inc|accessdate=08/24/2012|quote=David Brown, President of LifeVantage Network, recognized Protandim's potential.

===Voluntary Recall=== 
In December 2012, LifeVantage issued a voluntary recall of select lots (10 in total) of Protandim due to potential health risks arising from the possible inclusion of small metal fragments in the final product.<ref>{{cite press release|title=LifeVantage Corporation Announces Voluntary Recall and Replacement of Select Lots of Protandim® Dietary Supplement Due to Potential Health Risk|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm331258.htm|accessdate=12/07/2012|date=December 5, 2012}}</ref> In February 2013, the company announced that it was extending the recall to include additional lots of the product, estimating the total cost of the recall at $5.9 million.<ref name=8KRecall>{{cite news|title=Form 8-K for LifeVantage Corp|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/e/130213/lfvn8-k.html|accessdate=0216/2013|newspaper=Yahoo.com|date=February 13, 2013}}</ref>

===Overview===
Twelve peer-reviewed research studies of Protandim have been published as of 2012; all but two<ref name=study1/><ref name=clinical2>{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajplung.00171.2011 |title=Protandim does not influence alveolar epithelial permeability or intrapulmonary oxidative stress in human subjects with alcohol use disorders |year=2012 |last1=Burnham |first1=Ellen L. |last2=McCord |first2=Joe M. |last3=Bose |first3=Swapan |last4=Brown |first4=Lou Ann S. |last5=House |first5=Robert |last6=Moss |first6=Marc |last7=Gaydos |first7=Jeanette |journal=American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology |volume=302 |issue=7 |pages=L688–99 |pmid=22268125 |pmc=3330762}}</ref> were conducted in [[in vitro]] or [[in vivo]] animal models.

A 2008 review article noted that while many supplements are claimed to act as antioxidants, changes in the levels of [[TBARS]] and increases in the levels of antioxidant enzymes in response to a treatment do not provide a reliable indication that the treatment has an antioxidant effect, since the same responses are produced by [[pro-oxidant]] compounds that induce oxidative stress. The authors suggested that measurement of [[isoprostane]]s might be a better indication of [[lipid peroxidation]] and oxidative damage to DNA.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0007114508965752 |title=Use of conventional and -omics based methods for health claims of dietary antioxidants: A critical overview |year=2008 |last1=Knasmüller |first1=Siegfried |last2=Nersesyan |first2=Armen |last3=Mišík |first3=Miroslav |last4=Gerner |first4=Christopher |last5=Mikulits |first5=Wolfgang |last6=Ehrlich |first6=Veronika |last7=Hoelzl |first7=Christine |last8=Szakmary |first8=Akos |last9=Wagner |first9=Karl-Heinz |journal=British Journal of Nutrition |volume=99 |pmid=18503734 |pages=ES3–52}}</ref> 

A 2011 blog by [[Harriet A.

===Human clinical studies===
Two studies of Protandim have been conducted in human subjects. One of these studies, a non-randomized, non-controlled trial, reported that Protandim increased the levels of the antioxidant enzymes SOD and catalase [[red blood cells]] while reducing [[TBARS assay#Tests|TBAR]] levels in [[blood plasma]].<ref name="McCook">{{cite journal |author=Alison McCook|title=Your Money for Your Life |journal=The Scientist|volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=33 |year=2006 |month=February |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/23192/#ixzz1DA5Ng18E}}</ref><ref name=study1>{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Sally K. |last2=Bose |first2=Swapan K. |last3=Grunwald |first3=Gary K. |last4=Myhill |first4=Paul |last5=McCord |first5=Joe M. |title=The induction of human superoxide dismutase and catalase in vivo: A fundamentally new approach to antioxidant therapy |journal=Free Radical Biology and Medicine |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=341–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16413416 |doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.08.043}}</ref> 

The second study, a [[double-blinded]], [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized]], [[placebo]]-controlled trial published by McCord and colleagues in 2012, examined the effect of Protandim on [[pulmonary]] oxidative stress and [[alveolar]] epithelial permeability in 30 recovering [[alcoholics]].<ref name=clinical2/> Protandim (14 subjects at a dose of 1350&nbsp;mg/day; double the daily dose recommended by the manufacturer) or placebo (in 16 subjects) were administered for 7 days. Relative to placebo-treatment, Protandim had no significant effects on alveolar epithelial permeability or on oxidative stress, epithelial growth factor, [[fibroblast growth factor]], [[IL1B|interleukin-1β]], and [[interleukin-10]] levels in [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] fluid. Treatment with placebo, however, produced a significant reduction in [[blood plasma|plasma]] levels of [[TBARS assay#Tests|TBARS]], a marker of oxidative stress (i.e., lipid peroxidation).

===In vitro and animal studies===
In studies published by LifeVantage executive [[Joe M.
