'''Loin pain hematuria syndrome''', also '''LPHS''', is the combination of [[unilateral]] or [[Bilateral symmetry|bilateral]] flank [[pain]] and [[microscopic]] or [[macroscopic]] amounts of [[blood]] in the [[urine]] that is otherwise unexplained.<ref name=pukenas>{{Cite journal|author=Pukenas BA, Zaslau S |title=Loin pain hematuria syndrome: case series |journal=W V Med J |volume=99 |issue=5 |pages=192–3 |year=2003 |pmid=14959511 |doi=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
LPHS is considered a [[diagnosis of exclusion]]. The syndrome presents with [[hematuria]] (blood in the urine) and flank (a region of the lower back beneath the ribs and above the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]]) pain which can result from a number of causes.

===Relation to chronic pelvic pain===
LPHS has considerable overlap with [[chronic pelvic pain syndrome]].

===Relation to thin basement membrane disease===
A thin [[glomerular basement membrane]], as in [[thin basement membrane disease]], is proposed to be the characteristic finding on renal [[biopsy]],<ref name=hebert>{{Cite journal|author=Hebert LA, Betts JA, Sedmak DD, Cosio FG, Bay WH, Carlton S |title=Loin pain-hematuria syndrome associated with thin glomerular basement membrane disease and hemorrhage into renal tubules |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=168–73 |year=1996 |pmid=8770964 |doi=10.1038/ki.1996.23}}</ref> but not part of the syndrome definition.

==Prevalence==
The condition is very rare and predominately affects females.  Worldwide, only several hundred cases have been reported.

==Etiology==
The cause of LPHS is currently not known.<ref name=pukenas/>  One [[theory]] proposes that it is caused by a thin [[glomerulus|glomerular]] [[basement membrane]] and [[red blood cell]] (RBC) [[renal tubules|renal tubular]] congestion that leads to swelling of the [[kidney]] and distension of the [[renal fascia]] resulting in [[pain]].<ref name=hebert/>
At this time no cure has been found for this disease.  LPHS is a debilitating disease due to chronic pain and the inability to know how to control the [[glomerulus|glomerular]] aspect. The pain of LPHS can be worsened by acts as simple as riding in the car and undertaking daily activities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Many people with this disease are unable to maintain employment due to the debilitating pain.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Treatment==
The treatment of LPHS varies considerably from centre to centre. As the condition is rare and poorly understood, a widely adopted [[standard of care]] is not existent.

===Conservative===
[[Pain management]] with [[opiate]] and non-opiate [[analgesia]] is common. [[Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor]]s are thought to be beneficial,<ref name=hebert/> as they reduce intraglomerular pressure and, presumably, reduce renal tubular congestion with [[red blood cell|RBC]]s.

===Surgical===
Surgery ([[autotransplantation]]) is thought by some to be of benefit in selected individuals<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Chin JL, Kloth D, Pautler SE, Mulligan M |title=Renal autotransplantation for the loin pain-hematuria syndrome: long-term followup of 26 cases |journal=J. Urol. |volume=160 |issue=4 |pages=1232–5; discussion 1235–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9751325 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(01)62503-5}}</ref> and advocated in some centres, but usually considered the last resort.<ref name=parnham>{{Cite journal|author=Parnham AP, Low A, Finch P, Perlman D, Thomas MA |title=Recurrent graft pain following renal autotransplantation for loin pain haematuria syndrome |journal=Br J Urol |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=25–8 |year=1996 |pmid=8795395 |doi=}}</ref>

Many physicians discourage [[surgery]], as LPHS [[symptom]]s often re-occur after autotransplantation.<ref name=parnham/>

*[[Nutcracker syndrome]]
*[[IgA nephropathy]]
*[[Cancer]] of the [[genitourinary tract]] - classically not associated with pain
