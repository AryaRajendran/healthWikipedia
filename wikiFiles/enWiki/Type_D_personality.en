'''Type D personality''', a concept used in the field of medical psychology, is defined as the joint tendency towards negative affectivity (e.g., [[worry]], [[irritability]], [[gloom]]) and [[social inhibition]] (e.g., [[reticence]] and a lack of [[self-assurance]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Denollet, J., Sys, S.

==Characteristics==
Individuals with a Type D personality have the tendency to experience increased negative emotions across time and situations and tend not to share these emotions with others, because of fear of rejection or disapproval. Johan Denollet, [[professor]] of [[behavioral medicine|Medical Psychology]] at [[Tilburg University]], [[Tilburg]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]], developed the construct based on clinical observations in cardiac patients, [[empirical evidence]], and existing theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]].<ref>Author unknown (date unknown).

Retrieved from http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/corps/.</ref> The [[prevalence]] of Type D personality is 21% in the general population<ref name="Denollet2005">{{cite journal |author=Denollet, J. |title=DS14: standard assessment of negative affectivity, social inhibition, and Type D personality |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=89–97 |year=2005 |pmid=15673629 |doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000149256.81953.49}}</ref> and ranges between 18 to 53% in cardiac patients.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/157340306778019441 |url=http://bentham.org/ccr/openaccessarticles/ccr2-3/D0006CR.pdf |title=Is Type D Personality Here to Stay?

Research has shown that [[Coronary heart disease|CHD]] patients with a Type D [[Personality type|personality]] have a worse prognosis following a [[myocardial infarction]] (MI) as compared to patients without a Type D personality. Type D is associated with a 4-fold increased risk of mortality, recurrent MI, or [[sudden cardiac death]], independently of traditional risk factors, such as disease severity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Denollet, J., Sys, S.

==Assessment==
Type D personality can be assessed by means of a [[Validity (statistics)|valid]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliable]] 14-item questionnaire, the Type D Scale (DS14).<ref name="Denollet2005" /> Seven items refer to negative affectivity, and seven items refer to social inhibition. People who score 10 points or more on both dimensions are classified as Type D. The DS14 can be applied in [[clinical practice]] for the risk stratification of cardiac patients.{{fact|date=February 2013}}

Type D has also been addressed with respect to common somatic complaints in childhood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jellesma, F.
