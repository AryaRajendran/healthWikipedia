An '''adult diaper''' (or '''adult nappy''') is a [[diaper]] made to be worn by a person with a body larger than that of an infant or toddler. Diapers can be necessary for adults with various conditions, such as [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]], [[mobility impairment]], severe diarrhea or [[dementia]]. Adult diapers are made in various forms, including those resembling traditional child diapers, [[underpants]], and pads resembling [[sanitary napkin]]s (known as [[incontinence pad]]s).

In the medical community, professionals are trained to use alternative terms such as "briefs" rather than "diapers" for the sake of [[dignity]], as the term "diapers" is associated with children and therefore may have a negative connotation. In practice, though, most health care workers are accustomed to calling them diapers, especially those that resemble children's diapers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Uses==
===Health care===
{{Quote_box|width=35%|align=right|quote="''Although donning a diaper to decrease the number of bathroom stops is not something you or I would think to do, otherwise healthy adults do wear diapers more often than we realize for good reasons.''"|source=—Merlene Davis of the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'', referring to the [[Lisa Nowak]] incident and adult diaper usage in general.<ref name=merlenedavis/><ref name=redorbit/>}}
People with medical conditions which cause them to experience [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] or [[fecal incontinence]] often require diapers or similar products because they are unable to control their bladders or bowels. People who are bedridden or in wheelchairs, including those with good [[bowel]] and [[urinary incontinence|bladder]] control, may also wear diapers because they are unable to access the toilet independently. Those with cognitive impairment, such as [[dementia]], may require diapers because they may not recognize their need to reach a toilet.

Absorbent incontinence products come in a wide range of types (drip collectors, pads, underwear and adult diapers), each with varying capacities and sizes. The largest volume of products that is consumed falls into the lower absorbency range of products, and even when it comes to adult diapers, the cheapest and least absorbent brands are used the most.  This is not because people choose to use the cheapest and least absorbent brands, but rather because medical facilities are the largest consumer of adult diapers, and they have requirements to change patients as often as every two hours.  As such, they select products that meet their frequent-changing needs, rather than products that could be worn longer or more comfortably.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Specialty diapers are required for swimming or pool therapy. These are known as swim diapers or containment swim briefs. They are intended mainly for fecal incontinence, however they can also be useful for temporary urine containment, to maintain dignity while transferring from change room to pool. There are several brands available. The most effective style{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} is one that is made from a stretch fabric, such as the one manufactured by Discovery Trekking.<ref>[http://www.discoverytrekking.com/containment-swim-brief]</ref> The stretch allows for increased adjustability for a snug fit. They are washable and reusable. There are no disposable adult swim diapers.

===Astronauts===
[[Astronauts]] wear trunklike diapers called "[[Maximum Absorbency Garment]]s", or MAGs, during liftoff and landing.<ref>[http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/support/training/ascan/2004/journal12.html Behind the Scenes: Training<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  On space shuttle missions, each crew member receives three diapers—for launch, reentry and a spare in case reentry has to be waved off and tried later.<ref>Rivenburg, Roy.

===Fetishism and infantilism===
Diapers may also be worn by [[Paraphilic infantilism|infantilists]] and [[diaper_fetishism|diaper fetishists]] for comfort, sexual gratification or for emotional reasons.<ref name=Mednet2002>{{cite web|last=Pretlow|first=Robert A|title=The internet can reveal previously unknown causes of medical conditions, such as attraction to diapers as a cause of enuresis and incontinence |publisher=Mednet 2002|url=http://www.mednet2002.org/abstracts/display.cfm?id=166472151}}</ref>

===Other===
Other situations in which diapers are worn because access to a toilet is unavailable or not allowed for longer than even a normal [[urinary bladder]] can hold out include;
* Guards who must stay on duty and are not permitted to leave their posts; this is sometimes called the "watchman's urinal".<ref name=merlenedavis/><ref name=redorbit/>
* It has long been suggested that legislators don a diaper before an extended [[filibuster]], so often that it has been jokingly called "taking to the diaper."

In May 2010, the Japanese adult diaper market expanded to be used as an alternative fuel source. The used diapers are shred, dried, and sterilized to be turned into fuel pellets for boilers. The fuel pellets amount for 1/3 the original weight and contains about 5,000 kcal of heat per kilogram.<ref>"Used Adult Diapers - The Fuel Of Tomorrow, Today!" Inventorspot. 2 May 2010.

In September 2012, Japanese magazine [[:ja:SPA!|SPA!]] described the trend of wearing diapers among Japanese women.<ref>{{cite news | title = ズボラの最終形か？ オムツ女子の生態 | date = 2012-09-28 | url = http://nikkan-spa.jp/299209 | work = 日刊SPA！ | accessdate = 2012-10-14 | language = Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first =  Jordan | last = Chittley | title = Adult diapers a surprising new trend among Japanese women | date = 2012-10-08 | url = http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-buzz/adult-diapers-surprising-trend-among-japanese-women-172721799.html | work = Daily Buzz | accessdate = 2012-10-14}}</ref>

There are those who believe diapers are a preferable alternative to using the toilet.  According to Dr Dipak Chatterjee of [[Mumbai]] newspaper ''[[DNA (newspaper)|Daily News and Analysis]]'', public toilet facilities are so unhygienic that it is actually safer for people—especially women—who are vulnerable to infections to wear adult diapers instead.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dr. Dipak|last=Chatterjee|title=Docs advise diapers over public loos|date=2007-02-11|publisher=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1079314|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>  Seann Odoms of [[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]] magazine believes that wearing diapers can help people of all ages to maintain healthy bowel function. He himself claims to wear diapers full-time for this purported health benefit. "Diapers," he states, "are nothing other than a more practical and healthy form of underwear. They are the safe and healthy way of living."<ref name=SeannOdoms>[http://menshealth.about.com/cs/fromyou/a/wear_nappies.htm Nappies seriously manage your health - Seann Odoms]</ref>  Author [[Paul Davidson (author)|Paul Davidson]] argues that it should be socially acceptable for everyone to wear diapers permanently, claiming that they provide freedom and remove the unnecessary hassle of going to the toilet, just as social advancement has offered solutions to other complications.  He writes, "Make the elderly finally feel embraced instead of ridiculed and remove the teasing from the adolescent equation that affects so many children in a negative way. Give every person in this world the opportunity to live, learn, grow and urinate anywhere and anytime without societal pressure to "hold themselves in.""<ref>[http://www.pauldavidson.net/2006/10/22/adult-diapers-for-the-rest-of-us/ Adult Diapers for the rest of us]</ref>

==Dignity issues==
The usage of adult diapers can be a source of embarrassment,<ref name=WYGGYGG>{{cite web|last=Stack|first=Jennie Borodko|title=When You've Gotta Go, You've Gotta Go|publisher=[[Muscular Dystrophy Association]]|date=2001-02|url=http://www.mda.org/publications/Quest/q81gottago.html|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref> and products are often marketed under euphemisms such as incontinence pads.

In 2006, seventeen students taking a geriatrics [[pharmacotherapy]] course participated in a voluntary "diaper experience" exercise to help them understand the impact incontinence has on older adults.  The students, who wore adult diapers for a day before writing a paper about it, described the experience as unfamiliar and physically challenging, noting that being in diapers had a largely negative impact on them and that better solutions to incontinence are required.  However, they praised the exercise for giving them insight into incontinence and the effect it has on peoples' lives.<ref name=DiaperExperience>{{cite web|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p115730_index.html|title=Active Learning in a Geriatrics Pharmacotherapy Course: Outcomes Associated with a Diaper Experience Exercise|author=Boyce, Eric. and Dolder, Christian|date=2006-10-05|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina, San Diego, California|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>

In 2008, [[Ontario]]'s [[Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (Ontario)|Minister of Health]] [[George Smitherman]] revealed that he was considering wearing adult diapers himself to test their absorbency following complaints that nursing home residents were forced to remain in unchanged diapers for days at a time.  Smitherman's proposal earned him criticism from unions who argued that the priority was not the capacity of the diapers but rather staff shortages affecting how often they were changed, and he later apologized.<ref name=NationalPostSmitherman>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=339129|title=Smitherman considers wearing diaper|author=Jordana Huber|date=2008-02-28|publisher=[[National Post]]|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref><ref name=CTVSmitherman>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080227/smitherman_diaper_080227?s_name=&no_ads=|title=Ont. health minister prepared to don adult diaper|author=The Canadian Press|date=2008-02-27|publisher=[[CTV Television Network]]|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref><ref name=NationalPostJTE>{{cite web|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2008/02/27/john-turley-ewart-on-george-smitherman-and-his-dirty-diaper.aspx|title=John Turley-Ewart: On George Smitherman and his dirty diaper|author=John Turley-Ewart|date=2008-02-27|publisher=[[National Post]]|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref><ref name=StarSmitherman>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/Ontario/article/307727|title=I'm sorry, Smitherman says|author=Rob Ferguson|date=2008-02-28|publisher=The Star.com|accessdate=2008-05-20 | location=Toronto| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080602140934/http://www.thestar.com/News/Ontario/article/307727| archivedate= 2 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
