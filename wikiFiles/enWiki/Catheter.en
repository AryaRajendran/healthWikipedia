In [[Medicine]], a '''catheter''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|θ|ɪ|t|ər}} is a thin [[tubing (material)|tube]] extruded from medical grade materials serving a broad range of functions. Catheters are medical devices that can be inserted in the body to treat diseases or perform a surgical procedure. By modifying the material or adjusting the way catheters are manufactured, it is possible to tailor catheters for cardiovascular, urological, gastrointestinal, neurovascular, and ophthalmic applications.

Catheters can be inserted into a body cavity, duct, or vessel. Functionally, they allow drainage, administration of fluids or gases, access by surgical instruments, and also perform wide variety of other tasks depending on the type of catheter.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diggery |first=Robert |title=Catheters: Types, applications and potential complications (medical devices and equipment) |year=2012 |publisher=Nova Science |isbn=1621006301 |url=http://www.amazon.com/Catheters-Applications-Potential-Complications-Equipment/dp/1621006301}}</ref> The process of inserting a catheter is '''catheterization'''. In most uses, catheter is a thin, flexible tube ("soft" catheter) though catheters are available in varying levels of stiffness depending on the application. A catheter left inside the body, either temporarily or permanently, may be referred to as an '''indwelling catheter'''. A permanently inserted catheter may be referred to as a '''permcath''' (originally a trademark).

The ancient [[Syria]]ns created catheters from [[Reed (plant)|reed]]s. "Katheter — καθετήρ" originally referred to an instrument that was inserted such as a plug. The word "katheter" in turn came from "kathiemai — καθίεμαι" meaning "to sit". The ancient Greeks inserted a hollow metal tube through the [[urethra]] into the [[bladder]] to empty it and the tube came to be known as a "katheter".

==Uses==
Placement of a catheter into a particular part of the body may allow:
* draining [[urine]] from the [[urinary bladder]] as in [[urinary catheterization]], e.g., the [[Intermittent catheter|intermittent catheters]] or [[Foley catheter]] or even when the urethra is damaged as in [[Suprapubic cystostomy|suprapubic catheterisation]].
* drainage of urine from the kidney by percutaneous (through the skin) [[nephrostomy]]
* drainage of fluid collections, e.g. an abdominal [[abscess]]
* administration of [[intravenous]] fluids, [[medication]] or [[parenteral nutrition]] with a [[peripheral venous catheter]]
* [[angioplasty]], [[angiography]], [[balloon septostomy]], [[sinuplasty (procedure)|balloon sinuplasty]], [[cardiac electrophysiology|cardiac electrophysiology testing]], [[catheter ablation]]. Often the [[Seldinger technique]] is used.
* direct measurement of [[blood pressure]] in an [[artery]] or [[vein]]
* direct measurement of [[intracranial pressure]]
* administration of [[anaesthetic]] medication into the [[epidural]] space, the [[subarachnoid space]], or around a major nerve bundle such as the [[brachial plexus]]
* administration of [[oxygen]], [[Volatile anaesthetic|volatile anesthetic agents]], and other breathing gases into the lungs using a [[tracheal tube]]
* [[Subcutis|subcutaneous]] administration of [[insulin]] or other medications, with the use of an [[infusion set]] and [[insulin pump]]
* A [[central venous catheter]] is a conduit for giving [[medication|drugs]] or fluids into a large-bore catheter positioned either in a [[vein]] near the [[heart]] or just inside the [[atrium (anatomy)|atrium]].
* A [[Swan-Ganz catheter]] is a special type of catheter placed into the [[pulmonary artery]] for measuring pressures in the heart.
* An ''[[embryo transfer]] catheter'' is designed to insert fertilized embryos from [[in vitro fertilization]] into the uterus. They may vary in length from approximately 150 mm to 190 mm.
* An [[umbilical line]] is a catheter used in [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]]s (NICU) providing quick access to the central circulation of [[Premature birth|premature infants]].
* A ''Tuohy-Borst adapter'' is a medical device used for attaching catheters to various other devices.
* A ''Quinton catheter'' is a double or triple lumen, external catheter used for [[hemodialysis]].
* An intrauterine catheter, such as a device known as a 'tom cat', may be used to insert specially 'washed' sperm directly into the uterus in [[artificial insemination]]. A physician is required to administer this procedure.

==Inventors==
The earliest American invention of the flexible catheter was during the 18th century. Extending his inventiveness to his family's medical problems, [[Benjamin Franklin]] invented the flexible catheter in 1752 when his brother John suffered from bladder stones. Franklin's catheter was made of metal with segments hinged together with a wire enclosed to provide rigidity during insertion.<ref name="Minnesota Historical Society">{{cite web|title=Benjamin Franklin: In Search of a Better World|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|url=http://benfranklinexhibit.org/resume}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hirschmann, J.V. |date=December 2005 |title=Benjamin Franklin and Medicine |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=143 |issue=11 |pages=830–4 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-143-11-200512060-00012 |url=http://annals.org/data/Journals/AIM/20104/0000605-200512060-00012.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

According to a footnote in his letter in Volume 4 of the Papers of Benjamin Franklin (1959), [[Benjamin Franklin]] credits Francesco Roncelli-Pardino from 1720 as the inventor of a flexible catheter. In fact, [[Benjamin Franklin]] claims the flexible catheter may have been designed even earlier<ref>{{cite journal |author=Huth, E.J. |title=Benjamin Franklin's place in the history of medicine |journal=Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh |volume=37 |issue=4 |year=2007 |format=PDF |pages=373–8 |url=http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/journal/issue/journal_37_4/Huth.pdf}}</ref>

An early modern application of the catheter was employed by [[Claude Bernard]] for the purpose of cardiac catheterization in 1844. The procedure involved entering a horse’s ventricles via the jugular vein and carotid artery. This appears to be an earlier and modern application of the catheter because this catheter approach technique is still performed by neurosurgeons, cardiologists, and cardiothoracic surgeons<ref>{{cite book|last=Baim|first=Donald|title=Grossman's Cardiac Catheterization, Angiography, and Intervention|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0781755672}}</ref>

[[David S. Sheridan]] was the inventor of the modern disposable catheter in the 1940s. In his lifetime he started and sold four catheter companies and was dubbed the "Catheter King" by [[Forbes Magazine]] in 1988. He is also credited with the invention of the modern "disposable" plastic [[endotracheal tube]] now used routinely in surgery. Prior to his invention, red rubber tubes were used, sterilized, and then re-used which often led to the spread of disease and also held a high risk of infection. As a result Mr Sheridan is credited with saving thousands of lives.

In the early 1900s, a Dubliner named Walsh and a famous Scottish urinologist called Norman Gibbon teamed together to create the standard catheter used in hospitals today. Named after the two creators, it was called the Gibbon-Walsh catheter. The Gibbon and the Walsh catheters have been described and their advantages over other catheters shown. The Walsh catheter is particularly useful after [[prostatectomy]] for it drains the bladder without infection or clot retention. The Gibbon catheter has largely obviated the necessity of performing emergency prostatectomy. It is also very useful in cases of urethral [[fistula]]. A simple procedure such as dilatation of the urethra and passage of a Gibbon catheter often causes the fistula to close. This catheter is also of use in the treatment of urethral stricture and, as a temporary measure, in the treatment of retention of urine caused by carcinoma of the prostate.

==Materials==
A range of [[polymer]]s are used for the construction of catheters, including [[silicone rubber]], [[nitinol]], [[nylon]], [[polyurethane]], and polyethylene terephthalate (PETE)  [[latex]], and [[thermoplastic elastomer]]s.  Silicone is one of the most common choices because it is inert and unreactive to body fluids and a range of medical fluids with which it might come into contact.  On the other hand, the polymer is weak mechanically, and a number of serious fractures have occurred in catheters{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.  For example, silicone is used in [[Foley catheter]]s where fractures have been reported, often requiring surgery to remove the tip left in the bladder.

There are many different types of catheters for bladder problems.  A typical modern [[intermittent catheter]] is made from polyurethane and comes in different lengths and sizes for men, women and children.  The most advanced catheters have a thin [[hydrophilic]] surface coating.  When immersed in water this coating swells to a smooth, slippery film making the catheter safer and more comfortable to insert.  Some catheters are packed in a sterile [[saline solution]].

==Interventional procedures==
Different catheter tips can be used to guide the catheter into the target vessel.
