'''Aldrin''' is an [[organochlorine compound|organochlorine]] [[insecticide]] that was widely used until the 1970s, when it was banned in most countries. It is a colourless solid. Before the ban, it was heavily used as a pesticide to treat seed and soil.  Aldrin and related "cyclodiene" pesticides became notorious as [[persistent organic pollutant]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>Robert L. Metcalf “Insect Control” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry” Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a14_263}}</ref>

==Production==
Aldrin is produced by combining [[hexachlorocyclopentadiene]] with [[norbornadiene]] in a [[Diels-Alder reaction]] to give the adduct.<ref name="Tedder">{{cite book |first=A. H. | last=Jubb |year=1975

Similarly, an [[isomer]] of aldrin, known as '''isodrin''' is produced by reaction of hexachloronobornadiene with [[cyclopentadiene]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/JR9610004809 | title = 946.

Aldrin is named after the German chemist [[Kurt Alder]], one of the coinventors of this kind of reaction.  An estimated 270 million kilograms of aldrin and related cyclodiene pesticides were produced between 1946 and 1976.

In soil, on plant surfaces, or in the digestive tracts of insects, aldrin oxidizes to the [[epoxide]] [[dieldrin]], which is more strongly insecticidal.

==Environmental impact and regulation==
Like related polychlorinated pesticides, aldrin is highly lipophilic.  Its solubility in water is only 0.027 mg/L, which exacerbates its persistence in the environment.  It was banned by the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]].  In the U.S., aldrin was cancelled in 1974. The substance is banned from use for plant protection by the [[EU]]. <ref name=bnpuk>{{cite web

==Safety and environmental aspects==
Aldrin has rat {{LD50}} of 39 to 60 mg/kg (oral in rats).  For fish however, it is extremely toxic, with an [[LC50]] of 0.006– 0.01 for [[trout]] and [[blue gill]].<ref name=Ullmann/>
