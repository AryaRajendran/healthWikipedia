'''Commotio cordis''' ([[Latin]], "agitation of the heart") is an often lethal disruption of [[heart rhythm]] that occurs as a result of a blow to the area directly over the heart (the [[precordium|precordial region]]), at a critical time during the cycle of a heart beat causing cardiac arrest. It is a form of [[ventricular fibrillation]] (V-Fib), not mechanical damage to the heart muscle or surrounding organs, and not the result of heart disease. The fatality rate is about 65%.<ref>?</ref> It can sometimes, but not always, be reversed by defibrillation.<ref name="Maron BJ, Estes NA 3rd 2010 917–27">{{Cite journal |author=Maron BJ, Estes NA 3rd |title=Medical Progress: Commotio cordis |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=362 |issue=10 |pages=917–27 |date=11 Mar 2010|pmid=20220186 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMra0910111}}</ref>

Commotio cordis occurs mostly in boys and young men (average age 15), usually during [[sport]]s, most often baseball, often despite a chest protector. It is most often caused by a projectile, but can also be caused by the blow of an elbow or other body part. Being less developed, the thorax of an adolescent is likely more prone to this injury given the circumstances.

The phenomenon was confirmed experimentally in the 1930s, with research in anaesthetized [[rabbit]]s, [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s.<ref>Schlomka G. Commotio cordis und ihre Folgen. Die Einwirkung stumpfer Brustwandtraumen auf das Herz. Ergebnisse der inneren Medizin und Kinderheilkunde. 1934;47: 1-91.</ref>

==Incidence==
''Commotio cordis'' is a very rare event, but nonetheless is often considered when an athlete presents with sudden cardiac death. Some of the sports which have a risk for this cause of trauma are [[baseball]], [[association football]], [[ice hockey]], [[polo]], [[rugby football]], [[cricket]], [[softball]], [[Basque pelota|pelota]], [[fencing]], [[lacrosse]], [[boxing]], [[karate]], [[kung fu]] and other [[martial arts]]. [[Child]]ren are especially vulnerable, possibly{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} due to the mechanical properties of their [[thorax|thoracic skeleton]].  From 1996 to spring 2007, the [[United States|USA]] National Commotio Cordis Registry had 188 cases recorded, with about half occurring during [[organized sport]]s<ref name="lacrosse">{{cite web| url=http://www.lacrosse.org/safety/commotio_cordis_position.phtml |title=Position Statement on Commotio Cordis| publisher=[[US Lacrosse]]| accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref>  Almost all (96%) of the victims were male, the mean age of the victims during that period was 14.7 years, and fewer than 1 in 5 survived the incident.<ref name="lacrosse"/>
.

==Other situations==
''Commotio cordis'' may also occur in other situations, such as in children who are punished with blows over the precordium, cases of [[torture]], frontal collisions of [[motor vehicle]]s (the impact of the steering wheel against the thorax, although this has decreased substantially with the use of [[safety belt]]s and [[air bag]]s).

In contrast, the [[precordial thump]] (hard blows given over the precordium with a closed fist in order to revert [[cardiac arrest]]) is a sanctioned procedure for emergency resuscitation by trained health professionals witnessing a ''monitored'' arrest when no equipment is at hand, endorsed by the latest guidelines of the [http://www.erc.edu/index.php/ilcor/en/ International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]. It has been discussed controversially, as—in particular in severe hypoxia—it may cause the opposite effect (i.e., a worsening of rhythm—''commotio cordis''). In a normal adult, the energy range involved in the precordial thump is 5-10 times below that associated with commotio cordis.<ref name="Kohl2005">Kohl P, Sachs F & Franz M (eds): ''Cardiac Mechano-Electric Feedback and Arrhythmias: from Pipette to Patient''. Elsevier (Saunders), Philadelphia 2005.</ref>

==Mechanism of injury==

[[Image:Commotio Cordis Risk Zone.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram showing the portion of normal sinus rhythm during which commotio cordis is a risk]]

The following factors influence the chance of ''commotio cordis'':

* Direction of impact over the precordium (precise area, angle of impact)
* Total applied energy (area of impact versus energy, i.e., the mass of the projectile multiplied by half the square of its velocity)
* Impact occurring within a specific 10–30-millisecond portion of the cardiac cycle. This period occurs in the ascending phase of the T wave, when the ventricular myocardium is repolarizing, moving from [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] to [[diastole]] (relaxation).

The small window of vulnerability explains why it is a rare event. Considering that the total cardiac cycle has a duration of 1000 milliseconds (for a base cardiac frequency of 60 beats per minute), the probability of a mechanical trauma within the window of vulnerability is 1 to 3% only. That also explains why the heart becomes ''more'' vulnerable when it is physically strained by sports activities:
# The increase in heart rate (exercise [[tachycardia]]) may double the probability above (e.g., with 120 beats per minute the cardiac cycle shortens to 500 milliseconds without fundamentally altering the window-of-vulnerability's size);
# Relative exercise-induced [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and acceleration of the excito-conductive system of the heart make it more susceptible to stretch-induced ventricular fibrillation.

The [[cell (biology)|cellular]] mechanisms of ''commotio cordis'' are still poorly understood, but probably related to the activation of mechano-sensitive proteins, [[ion channels]].

It is estimated that impact energies of at least 50 [[joule]]s are required to cause cardiac arrest, when applied in the right time and spot of the precordium of an adult. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Impacts of up to 130 joules have already been measured with [[hockey puck]]s and lacrosse balls, 450 joules in karate punches and 1028 joules in boxer [[Rocky Marciano]]'s punch.<ref name="titlescience.ca View question #821">{{cite web |url=http://www.science.ca/askascientist/viewquestion.php?qID=821 |title=science.ca View question #821 |accessdate=2008-02-23 |format= |work=}}</ref> The 50-joule threshold, however, can be considerably lowered when the victim's heart is under [[ischemia|ischemic]] conditions, such as in [[coronary artery]] insufficiency.<ref name="Kohl2005" />

There is also an upper limit of impact energy applied to the heart; too much energy will create structural damage to the heart muscle as well as causing electrical upset.  This condition is referred to as [[contuiso cordis|''contusio cordis'']] (from Latin for ''bruising of the heart''). On isolated [[guinea pig]] hearts, as little as 5 [[millijoule|mJ]] was needed to induce release of [[creatine kinase]], a marker for [[muscle cell]] damage.<ref name="pmid16125216">{{cite journal |author=Cooper PJ, Epstein A, Macleod IA, ''et al.'' |title=Soft tissue impact characterisation kit (STICK) for ex situ investigation of heart rhythm responses to acute mechanical stimulation |journal=Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. |volume=90 |issue=1–3 |pages=444–68 |year=2006 |pmid=16125216 |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2005.07.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0079-6107(05)00060-X}}</ref> Obviously one should take into account that this figure does not include the dissipation of energy through the chest wall, and is not scaled up for humans, but it is indicative that relatively small amounts of energy are required to reach the heart before physical damage is done.

==Outcome and treatment==

Most cases are fatal. [[Automated external defibrillator]]s have helped increase the survival rate to 35%.<ref name="Maron BJ, Estes NA 3rd 2010 917–27"/> Defibrillation must be started as soon as possible (within 3 minutes) for maximal benefit. Commotio cordis is the leading cause of fatalities in youth baseball in the US, with 2 to 3 deaths per year.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 1951221 | volume=145 | issue=11 | title=Commotio cordis. The single, most common cause of traumatic death in youth baseball | year=1991 | month=November | author=Abrunzo TJ | journal=Am. J. Dis. Child. | pages=1279–82}}</ref> It has been recommended that "communities and [[school district]]s reexamine the need for accessible automatic defibrillators and cardiopulmonary resuscitation-trained [[coach (sports)|coach]]es at organized sporting events for children."<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16356450 | doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2005.07.041 | volume=147 | issue=6 | title=Efficacy of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and out-of-hospital automated external defibrillation as life-saving therapy in commotio cordis | year=2005 | month=December | author=Salib EA, Cyran SE, Cilley RE, Maron BJ, Thomas NJ | journal=J. Pediatr. | pages=863–6}}</ref>

==Prevention==

The risk would probably be reduced by improved coaching techniques, such as teaching young batters to turn away from the ball to avoid errant pitches, according to doctors. Defensive players in lacrosse and hockey are now taught to avoid using their chest to block the ball or puck. Chest protectors and vests are designed to reduce trauma from blunt bodily injury, but this does not offer protection from commotio cordis and may offer a false sense of security. Almost 20% of the victims in competitive football, baseball, lacrosse and hockey were wearing protectors. This ineffectiveness has been confirmed by animal studies. Development of adequate chest protectors may prove difficult.<ref name="Maron BJ, Estes NA 3rd 2010 917–27"/>

==Legal issues==

Several people have been convicted of involuntary [[manslaughter]] in cases involving insufficient and slow medical help to athletes who experienced ''commotio cordis'' during sports events,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11792344 | volume=89 | issue=2 | title=Criminal consequences of commotio cordis | year=2002 | month=January | author=Maron BJ, Mitten MJ, Greene Burnett C | journal=Am. J. Cardiol. | pages=210–3 | doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(01)02202-0}}</ref> as well as in cases of intentional delivery of contusive blows.
