The '''Medical Profile''' (or {{Hebrew|פרופיל רפואי}}) is the system of numbers the '''[[Israel Defense Forces|Israel Defense Forces (IDF)]]''' uses to indicate the medical suitability of a person in order to serve in various positions in the IDF. The profiles range between 21 (which dismisses the subject from serving in the IDF automatically) and 97 (which allows the subject to apply to every unit in the IDF). A profile of 64 and under makes it impossible to serve as a combatant.

The profile is determined for the first time after passing the screening process for military service in the recruitment office, and may vary during the entire military service (regular and reserve), after events that change the state of health of the soldier. Sometimes it could go down only for a while, due to a temporal deterioration of the health of the soldier (for example, after an injury).

==Known Profile numbers==

===Combatant===
*'''97''': Perfectly healthy and fit for field combat units, in the elite units in the corps as well as in the combat battalions. In cases of very mild problems (such as the need for glasses), a note is added that does not lower the profile, but dismisses the soldier from volunteering to be a part of the elite units. Since 2005, soldiers can be accepted for the flight training course with glasses (up to 1 diopter).
*'''82''': A slight problem (for example: color blindness). Unfit for elite combat units but fit for infantry and the combat battalions.
*'''77''': A special profile for people who suffer from allergic rhinitis and excessive perspiration. Fit to serve in roles that require a 04 level of combat training (for example, certain positions in the engineering corps)
*'''72''': A moderate problem (knee or back problems, mild asthma, allergies or a high level of myopia (above 7 diopters). Unfit for infantry service, but eligible for several combat units like the [[Armored Corps (Israel)|Armored Corps]], [[Artillery Corps (Israel)|Artillery]], [[Israeli Air Defense Command|Air Defense]], specific roles in the [[Field Intelligence Corps]] and the [[Caracal Battalion]].
*'''65''': A problem or injury caused during the military service.

===Non-combatant===
*'''64''': A serious problem (asthma, low BMI, [[attention deficit disorder]], high blood pressure). Unfit for combat.
*'''45''': A very serious problem (severe asthma, severe orthopedic problems, severe mental status). Unfit for combat service and many military courses.
*'''35''': A special profile for people with diabetes, the hearing impaired and people with epilepsy. Able to serve in various roles with certain limitations due to their medical condition.
*'''30''': Volunteers who received a profile of 21 and nonetheless asked to serve.
*'''24''': Temporarily unfit for service (severe sensitivity to bee stings, temporary low BMI, anemia). The soldier gets a temporary exemption and gets monitored every few months with the possibility of raising his profile.
*'''21''': Totally unfit for military service for health reasons (physical or mental). With this profile a soldier can still volunteer for military service by getting a profile of 30. See [[Profile 21]].
