The '''National Migraine Centre''' (formerly the '''City of London Migraine Clinic''') is a specialist treatment centre for [[migraine]] and other primary headaches. The clinic also carries out extensive research and education to improve treatment and awareness.

The Clinic has three main objectives to:
* Provide treatment to all sufferers of migraine and other headaches
* Conduct, promote and publish research into the causes, treatment and alleviation of migraine and other headaches
* Share knowledge through training, lecturing and publications

It is located in [[Charterhouse Square]] in the [[London Borough of Islington]] and has more than 30 years of experience in solving headaches. They have a team of registered doctors with a special interest in headaches providing specialist care in a charitable setting. It is a registered charity and [[social enterprise]] and is independent of the [[National Health Service]] (NHS), though they work with the NHS by offering their "specialist headache services."<ref>[http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/17413 "Ivan Lewis announces £27m extra for Social Enterprise"], eGovMonitor, Department of Health, February 27, 2008</ref> Most of the facility patients live in London and the [[Home Counties]] but patients come from other parts of the UK and abroad.<ref name="Axe" />

The clinic is the only independent, charitable clinic in the world entirely focused on headaches and migraines.<ref>Oliver, Sarah, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/5517460/Stop-the-painkillers.-Stop-the-pain.html "Stop the painkillers. Stop the pain"], [[The Daily Telegraph]], June 15, 2009</ref>

==History==
The Clinic was founded by Dr Nat Blau and Dr Marcia Wilkinson in 1980<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/341/7768/Obituaries.full.pdf|title=Obituaries|publisher=British Medical Journal|accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref> as an independent registered medical charity affiliated with [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]. The Clinic initially provided a 'walk in' service for patients during an acute migraine attack and acted as a research centre into the causes and better treatment of migraine. Research undertaken on these patients led to the identification of an effective acute therapy with [[aspirin]] and [[metoclopramide]] that is now offered as a standard line of management.   

Dr Wilkinson won the first [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Award]], presented at the Headache World 2000 meeting in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w-h-a.org/index.cfm/spKey/archive/spId/C1F6F2E5-B693-0D9F-01FC733D4EB259C0.html|title=Female Headache Expert Honoured With First Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Award|publisher=World Headache Alliance|accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref> The previous Medical Director [[Anne MacGregor]] won the same award in 2002. 

The current Medical Director is Consultant Neurologist Giles Elrington.
