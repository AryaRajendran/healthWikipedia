'''Hermann Wagner''' (born May 20, 1941) is a German scientist in the field of microbiology and immunology and past-Dean of the Medical Faculty of the Technical University Munich (TUM).

==Curriculum Vitae==
{{Reference necessary|text=Wagner studied Medicine and in 1967 received his medical degree (MD) from the [[University of Tübingen]]. In Melbourne, Australia he studied [[Human Biology]] and in 1973 received his [[PhD]] from [[University of Melbourne|Melbourne University]]. From 1973 to 1983 he continued his research on " [[T cell|T Cell]] mediated Immune Responses" with Paul Klein at the Institut of Microbiology of the Johannes-Gutenberg University in Mainz/Germany. In 1978, he qualified as a university lecturer ([[habilitation]]), and in 1983 he was  made full professor and head of the Institut of Microbiology at the [[University of Ulm]]. In 1989 he moved to the [[Technical University Munich]], where he heads the Institute of Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene.|date=May 2011}}

==Research work==
{{Reference necessary|text=His prime research activities focus on mechanisms of protective immunity towards pathogens. From 1970-80 he analysed T-T Cell interactions during the induction of [[Cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic T Cell]] responses. During his Ulm period he focussed on the immunobiology of bacterial superantigens. In Munich, he subsequently contributed to our understanding of Toll-like-Receptors(TLR), through which innate imune clls sense pathogens. In particular he was one of the first to realise that bacterial/viral DNA activated  Innate Immune cells via TLR9. Conversely his group was able to show that TLR7 and/or TLR8 recognised pathogen derived RNA.|date=May 2011}}

{{Reference necessary|text=In Ulm he initiated and headed the Collaborative Research Program of the German Research Council (Sonderforschungsbereich) entitled "Lympo-Haemopoese",In Munich he expanded the research area "Infection and Immunity" to a major research focus of his Faculty. He co-initiated 3 Collaborative Research Programs and is since 1999 speaker of the program "Target structures for selective Tumor-Interventions".|date=May 2011}}

{{Reference necessary|text=His honorary functions include:Presidency of the German Society of Immunology,Dean of the Faculty of Medicine (TUM) and Chairmen of the Science Advisory Board-IZKF-University Würzburg.A number of his "pupills" (n=11) are now heading university departments - or other science-institutions.Thus, his pupills operate as creative academic school in Germany.|date=May 2011}}
