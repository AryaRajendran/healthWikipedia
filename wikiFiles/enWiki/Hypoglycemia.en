'''Hypoglycemia''' ([[American and British English differences|also spelled]] '''hypoglycaemia''' or '''hypoglycæmia''', not to be confused with [[hyperglycemia]]) is an abnormally diminished content of [[glucose]] in the [[blood]].<ref name="Stedman's">{{Cite document|last=Stedman|first=Thomas Lathrop| title=Stedman's Medical Dictionary|place=Baltimore |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|origyear=1911|year=2005|month=December|edition=28th|page=2100|url=http://www.stedmans.com|isbn=0-7817-3390-1|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}} </ref> The term literally means "low sugar blood" ([[Greek language|Gr.]] ''ὑπογλυκαιμία'', from ''hypo-'', ''glykys'', ''haima'').  It can produce a variety of [[symptoms]] and effects but the principal problems arise from an inadequate supply of glucose to the [[Human brain|brain]], resulting in impairment of function ([[neuroglycopenia]]). Effects can range from mild [[dysphoria]] to more serious issues such as [[seizures]], [[unconsciousness]], and (rarely) permanent [[brain damage]] or [[death]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hypoglycemia Symptoms|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/low_blood_sugar_hypoglycemia/page3_em.htm}}</ref> 

The most common forms of hypoglycemia occur as a complication of treatment of [[diabetes mellitus]] with [[insulin]] or [[oral hypoglycemic agent|oral medications]]. Hypoglycemia is less common in non-diabetic persons, but can occur at any age.  Among the causes are [[hyperinsulinism|excessive insulin]] produced in the body ([[hyperinsulinemia]]), [[inborn error of metabolism]], [[medication]]s and [[poison]]s, [[alcohol]], [[hormone]] deficiencies, prolonged [[starvation]], alterations of [[metabolism]] associated with [[infection]], and organ failure.

Hypoglycemia is treated by restoring the blood glucose level to normal by the ingestion or administration of [[dextrose]] or carbohydrate foods. In more severe circumstances, it is treated by injection or infusion of [[glucagon]]. Recurrent hypoglycemia may be prevented by reversing or removing the underlying cause, by increasing the frequency of [[meal]]s, with [[medication]]s like [[diazoxide]], [[octreotide]], or [[glucocorticoid]]s, or by [[surgery|surgical]] removal of much of the [[pancreas]].

The level of blood glucose low enough to define hypoglycemia may be different for different people, in different circumstances, and for different purposes, and occasionally has been a matter of controversy. Most healthy adults maintain [[fasting]] glucose levels above 4.0 [[Reference ranges for blood tests|mmol/L]] (72&nbsp;mg/dl), and develop symptoms of hypoglycemia when the glucose falls below 4&nbsp;mmol/L.<ref name="jefferson">{{Cite book|author=Cryer, Philip E. |chapter=Hypoglycemia |editor=Jefferson L, Cherrington A, Goodman H, eds. for the American Physiological Society |title=Handbook of Physiology; Section 7, The Endocrine System. |volume=II.

[[Hypoglycemia (common usage)]] is also a term in popular culture and [[alternative medicine]] for a common, often self-diagnosed, condition characterized by shakiness and altered mood and thinking, but without measured low glucose or risk of severe harm. It is treated by changing eating patterns.

Throughout a 24 hour period blood plasma glucose levels are generally maintained between 4-8&nbsp;mmol/L (72 and 144&nbsp;mg/dL).<ref name=Cryer_1997>{{Cite book|author=Cryer, Philip E. |title=Hypoglycemia: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1997 |page= |isbn=0-19-511325-X |oclc= 36188385|doi=}}</ref>{{rp|11}} Although 3.3 or 3.9&nbsp;mmol/L (60 or 70&nbsp;mg/dL) is commonly cited as the lower limit of normal glucose,  symptoms of hypoglycemia usually do not occur until 2.8 to 3.0&nbsp;mmol/L (50 to 54&nbsp;mg/dL).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=diabetes/14628&selectedTitle=2~150&source=search_result#H5 |title=UpToDate Inc. |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The precise level of glucose considered low enough to define hypoglycemia is dependent on (1) the measurement method, (2) the age of the person, (3) presence or absence of effects, and (4) the purpose of the definition. While there is no disagreement as to the normal range of blood sugar, debate continues as to what degree of hypoglycemia warrants medical evaluation or treatment, or can cause harm.<ref name=Koh_1988>{{cite journal |author=Koh TH, Eyre JA, Aynsley-Green A |title=Neonatal hypoglycaemia--the controversy regarding definition |journal=Arch.

Glucose concentrations are expressed as milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL or mg/100 mL) in the United States, Japan, Spain, France, Belgium, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Colombia and Israel, while millimoles per [[liter]] (mmol/L or mM) are the units used in most of the rest of the world. Glucose concentrations expressed as mg/dL can be converted to mmol/L by dividing by 18.0 g/dmol (the [[molar mass]] of glucose). For example, a glucose concentration of 90&nbsp;mg/dL is 5.0&nbsp;mmol/L or 5.0 mM.

===Method of measurement===
[[Blood glucose]] levels discussed in this article are [[vein|venous]] [[Blood plasma|plasma or serum]] levels measured by standard, automated [[glucose oxidase]] methods used in [[medical laboratory|medical laboratories]]. For clinical purposes, plasma and serum levels are similar enough to be interchangeable. [[Artery|Arterial]] plasma or serum levels are slightly higher than [[venous]] levels, and [[capillary]] levels are typically in between.<ref name=Tustison/> This difference between arterial and venous levels is small in the fasting state but is amplified and can be greater than 10% in the postprandial state.<ref name = "rssxhn">{{Cite book|author=[edited by] John Bernard Henry |title=Clinical diagnosis and management by laboratory methods |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-4639-5 |oclc= 4884633|doi=}}</ref> On the other hand, whole blood glucose levels (e.g., by [[glucose meter|fingerprick meters]]) are about 10%-15% lower than venous plasma levels.<ref name=Tustison>{{cite journal |author=Tustison WA, Bowen AJ, Crampton JH |title=Clinical interpretation of plasma glucose values |journal=Diabetes |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=775–7 |year=1966 |pmid=5924610 |doi=}}</ref> Furthermore, available [[fingerstick]] glucose meters are only warranted to be accurate to within 15% of a simultaneous laboratory value under optimal conditions,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and home use in the investigation of hypoglycemia is fraught with misleading low numbers.<ref name=Clarke_1987>{{cite journal |author=Clarke WL, Cox D, Gonder-Frederick LA, Carter W, Pohl SL |title=Evaluating clinical accuracy of systems for self-monitoring of blood glucose |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=622–8 |year=1987 |pmid=3677983 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.10.5.622}}</ref><ref name=Gama_2000>{{cite journal |author=Gama R, Anderson NR, Marks V |title='Glucose meter hypoglycaemia': often a non-disease |journal=Ann.

Two other factors significantly affect glucose measurement: [[hematocrit]] and delay after [[phlebotomy|blood drawing]]. The disparity between venous and whole blood concentrations is greater when the hematocrit is high, as in newborn infants, or adults with [[polycythemia]].<ref name = "rssxhn"/> High neonatal hematocrits are particularly likely to confound glucose measurement by meter. Second, unless the specimen is drawn into a [[sodium fluoride|fluoride]] tube or processed immediately to separate the serum or plasma from the cells, the measurable glucose will be gradually lowered by ''in vitro'' metabolism of the glucose at a rate of approximately 7&nbsp;mg/dL/hr, or even more in the presence of [[leukocytosis]].<ref name = "rssxhn"/><ref name=dePasqua_1984>{{cite journal |author=de Pasqua A, Mattock MB, Phillips R, Keen H |title=Errors in blood glucose determination |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8412 |page=1165 |year=1984 |pmid=6150231}}</ref><ref name=Horwitz_1989>{{cite journal |author=Horwitz DL |title=Factitious and artifactual hypoglycemia |journal=Endocrinol.

===Age differences===
Children's blood sugar levels are often slightly lower than adults'. Overnight fasting glucose levels are below 70&nbsp;mg/dL (3.9 mM) in 5% of healthy adults, but up to 5% of children can be below 60&nbsp;mg/dL (3.3 mM) in the morning fasting state.<ref name="Meites">{{Cite book|author=Samuel Meites, editor-in-chief |title=Pediatric clinical chemistry: reference (normal) values |publisher=AACC Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-915274-47-7 |oclc= 18497532|doi=|last2=Contributing Editors|first2=Gregory J. Buffone... []|display-authors=2}}</ref> As the duration of fasting is extended, a higher percentage of infants and children will have mildly low plasma glucose levels, usually without symptoms. The normal range of newborn blood sugars continues to be debated.<ref name="Koh_1988"/><ref name="Cornblath_1990"/><ref name="Cornblath_2000"/> It has been proposed that newborn brains are able to use alternate fuels when glucose levels are low more readily than adults. Experts continue to debate the significance and risk of such levels, though the trend has been to recommend maintenance of glucose levels above 60–70&nbsp;mg/dL the first day after birth.

===Presence or absence of effects===
Research in healthy adults shows that mental efficiency declines slightly but measurably as blood glucose falls below 65&nbsp;mg/dL (3.6 mM) in many people. [[hormone|Hormonal]] defense mechanisms ([[adrenaline]] and [[glucagon]]) are normally activated as it drops below a threshold level (about 55&nbsp;mg/dL (3.0 mM) for most people), producing the typical hypoglycemic symptoms of shakiness and [[dysphoria]].<ref name="isbn0-7216-9196-X">{{Cite book|author=Cryer, Philip E. |editor=Larsen, P. Reed, ed. |title=Williams Textbook of Endocrinology |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |edition=10th |year=2003 |chapter=Glucose homestasis and hypoglycemia |pages=1585–1618 |isbn=0-7216-9196-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|1589}}  Obvious impairment may not occur until the glucose falls below 40&nbsp;mg/dL (2.2 mM), and many healthy people may occasionally have glucose levels below 65 in the morning without apparent effects. Since the brain effects of hypoglycemia, termed [[neuroglycopenia]], determine whether a given low glucose is a "problem" for that person, most doctors use the term ''hypoglycemia'' only when a moderately low glucose level is accompanied by symptoms or brain effects.

Determining the presence of both parts of this definition is not always straightforward, as hypoglycemic symptoms and effects are vague and can be produced by other conditions; people with recurrently low glucose levels can lose their threshold symptoms so that severe neuroglycopenic impairment can occur without much warning, and many measurement methods (especially glucose meters) are imprecise at low levels.

[[Diabetic hypoglycemia]] represents a special case with respect to the relationship of measured glucose and hypoglycemic symptoms for several reasons. First, although home glucose meter readings are often misleading, the probability that a low reading, whether accompanied by symptoms or not, represents real hypoglycemia is much higher in a person who takes insulin than in someone who does not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/308/9/485?ijkey=f5b959a37b1a8754a4e583ffd636126f572e97c7&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |title=20 White NH, Skor D, Cryer PE, Bier DM, Levandoski L, Santiago JV: Identification of type 1 diabetic patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia during intensive therapy. N Engl J Med 308:485–491, 1983 |publisher=Content.nejm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/8/732?ijkey=f8bbc21f8a2aa52bf4be5331deba240047cdaac7&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |title=21 Bolli GB, De Feo P, De Cosmo S, Perriello G, Ventura MM, Massi-Benedetti M, Santeusanio F, Gerich JE, Brunetti P: A reliable and reproducible test for adequate glucose counterregulation in type 1 diabetes. Diabetes 33:732–737, 1984 |publisher=Diabetes.diabetesjournals.org |date=1984-08-01 |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref> Second, because injected insulin cannot be "turned off," diabetic hypoglycemia has a greater chance of progressing to serious impairment if not treated, compared to most other forms of hypoglycemia. Third, because glucose levels are often above normal for long periods of time (hours, days, or months) in persons with diabetes, hypoglycemic symptoms may sometimes occur at higher thresholds than in people whose blood sugar is usually normal. For all of these reasons, higher meter glucose thresholds are often considered "hypoglycemic" in people with diabetes.

===Purpose of definition===
For all of the reasons explained in the above paragraphs, deciding whether a blood glucose in the borderline range of 45–75&nbsp;mg/dL (2.5-4.2 mM) represents clinically problematic hypoglycemia is not always simple. This leads people to use different "cutoff levels" of glucose in different contexts and for different purposes. Because of all of the statistical and measurement variations listed above, the Endocrine Society recommends that a diagnosis of hypoglycemia as problem for an individual person be based on the combination of a low glucose level and evidence of adverse effects.<ref name="pmid19088155"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Hypoglycemic symptoms and manifestations can be divided into those produced by the counterregulatory hormones ([[epinephrine]]/adrenaline and glucagon) triggered by the falling glucose, and the [[neuroglycopenic]] effects produced by the reduced brain sugar.

===Adrenergic manifestations===
*Shakiness, [[anxiety]], nervousness
*[[Palpitation]]s, [[tachycardia]]
*[[Sweat]]ing, feeling of warmth (although sweat glands have muscarinic receptors, thus "adrenergic manifestations" is not entirely accurate)
*[[Pallor]], coldness, clamminess
*[[Dilated pupils]] (mydriasis)
*Feeling of numbness "[[Paresthesia|pins and needles]]" (paresthesia)

===Glucagon manifestations===
*[[Hunger (motivational state)|Hunger]], [[borborygmus]]
*[[Nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[abdominal pain|abdominal discomfort]]
*[[Headache]]

===Neuroglycopenic manifestations===
*Abnormal mentation, impaired judgment
*Nonspecific dysphoria, moodiness, depression, crying, exaggerated concerns
*Negativism, irritability, belligerence, combativeness, [[Rage (emotion)|rage]]
*[[Wiktionary:Personality|Personality]] change, emotional lability
*[[fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]], weakness, apathy, [[lethargy]], daydreaming, [[sleep]]
*Confusion, [[amnesia]], [[lightheadedness]] or dizziness, [[delirium]]
*Staring, "glassy" look, blurred vision, [[diplopia|double vision]]
*Flashes of light in the field of vision
*Automatic behavior, also known as [[automatism (medical)|automatism]]
*Difficulty speaking, slurred speech
*[[Ataxia]], incoordination, sometimes mistaken for "[[drunkenness]]"
*Focal or general motor deficit, [[paralysis]], [[hemiparesis]]
*[[Paresthesia]], [[headache]]
*Stupor, coma, abnormal breathing
*Generalized or focal [[seizure]]s

Not all of the above manifestations occur in every case of hypoglycemia. There is no consistent order to the appearance of the symptoms, if symptoms even occur. Specific manifestations may also vary by age, by severity of the hypoglycemia and the speed of the decline. In young children, vomiting can sometimes accompany morning hypoglycemia with [[ketosis]]. In older children and adults, moderately severe hypoglycemia can resemble [[mania]], mental illness, drug intoxication, or drunkenness. In the elderly, hypoglycemia can produce focal [[stroke]]-like effects or a hard-to-define malaise. The symptoms of a single person may be similar from episode to episode, but are not necessarily so and may be influenced by the speed at which glucose levels are dropping, as well as previous incidents.

In newborns, hypoglycemia can produce irritability, jitters, [[myoclonic jerk]]s, [[cyanosis]], respiratory distress, [[apnea|apneic]] episodes, sweating, [[hypothermia]], somnolence, [[hypotonia]], refusal to feed, and seizures or "spells." Hypoglycemia can resemble [[asphyxia]], [[hypocalcemia]], [[sepsis]], or [[heart failure]].

In both young and old patients, the brain may habituate to low glucose levels, with a reduction of noticeable symptoms despite [[neuroglycopenia|neuroglycopenic]] impairment. In insulin-dependent diabetic patients this phenomenon is termed ''[[Diabetic hypoglycemia#Hypoglycemic unawareness|hypoglycemia unawareness]]'' and is a significant clinical problem when improved [[Diabetes management#Glycemic control|glycemic control]] is attempted. Another aspect of this phenomenon occurs in [[glycogen storage disease|type I glycogenosis]], when chronic hypoglycemia before diagnosis may be better tolerated than acute hypoglycemia after treatment is underway.

Hypoglycemic symptoms can also occur when one is sleeping. Examples of symptoms during sleep can include damp bed sheets or clothes from perspiration. Having nightmares or the act of crying out can be a sign of hypoglycemia. Once the individual is awake they may feel tired, irritable, or confused and these may be signs of hypoglycemia as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/hypoglycemia |title=Hypoglycemia - National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse |publisher=Diabetes.niddk.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref>

In nearly all cases, hypoglycemia that is severe enough to cause seizures or unconsciousness can be reversed without obvious harm to the brain. Cases of death or permanent neurological damage occurring with a single episode have usually involved prolonged, untreated unconsciousness, interference with breathing, severe concurrent disease, or some other type of vulnerability. Nevertheless, brain damage or death has occasionally resulted from severe hypoglycemia.

==Causes==
The circumstances of hypoglycemia provide most of the clues to diagnosis. Circumstances include the age of the patient, time of day, time since last meal, previous episodes, nutritional status, physical and mental development, drugs or toxins (especially insulin or other diabetes drugs), diseases of other organ systems, family history, and response to treatment. When hypoglycemia occurs repeatedly, a record or "diary" of the spells over several months, noting the circumstances of each spell (time of day, relation to last meal, nature of last meal, response to carbohydrate, and so forth) may be useful in recognizing the nature and cause of the hypoglycemia.

An especially important aspect is whether the patient is seriously ill with another problem. Severe disease of nearly all major organ systems can cause hypoglycemia as a secondary problem. [[Hospital]]ized patients, especially in [[intensive care unit]]s or those prevented from eating, can suffer hypoglycemia from a variety of circumstances related to the care of their primary disease. Hypoglycemia in these circumstances is often multifactorial or even [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]]. Once identified, these types of hypoglycemia are readily reversed and prevented, and the underlying disease becomes the primary problem.

It may take longer to recover from severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness or seizure even after restoration of normal blood glucose. When a person has not been unconscious, failure of carbohydrate to reverse the symptoms in 10–15 minutes increases the likelihood that hypoglycemia was not the cause of the symptoms. When severe hypoglycemia has persisted in a hospitalized patient, the amount of glucose required to maintain satisfactory blood glucose levels becomes an important clue to the underlying etiology. Glucose requirements above 10&nbsp;mg/kg/minute in infants, or 6&nbsp;mg/kg/minute in children and adults are strong evidence for hyperinsulinism. In this context this is referred to as the ''glucose infusion rate'' (GIR). Finally, the blood glucose response to glucagon given when the glucose is low can also help distinguish among various types of hypoglycemia. A rise of blood glucose by more than 30&nbsp;mg/dl (1.70&nbsp;mmol/l) suggests insulin excess as the probable cause of the hypoglycemia.

In less obvious cases, a "critical sample" may provide the diagnosis. In the majority of children and adults with recurrent, unexplained hypoglycemia, the diagnosis may be determined by obtaining a sample of blood during hypoglycemia. If this '''critical sample''' is obtained ''at the time of hypoglycemia, before it is reversed'', it can provide information that would otherwise require a [[hospital]] admission and unpleasant starvation testing. Perhaps the most common inadequacy of [[emergency department]] care in cases of unexplained hypoglycemia is the failure to obtain at least a basic sample before giving glucose to reverse it.

Part of the value of the critical sample may simply be the proof that the symptoms are indeed due to hypoglycemia. More often, measurement of certain hormones and metabolites at the time of hypoglycemia indicates which organs and body systems are responding appropriately and which are functioning abnormally. For example, when the blood glucose is low, hormones which raise the glucose should be rising and insulin secretion should be completely suppressed.

The following is a brief list of hormones and metabolites which may be measured in a critical sample. Not all tests are checked on every patient. A "basic version" would include insulin, cortisol, and electrolytes, with C-peptide and drug screen for adults and growth hormone in children. The value of additional specific tests depends on the most likely diagnoses for an individual patient, based on the circumstances described above. Many of these levels change within minutes, especially if glucose is given, and there is no value in measuring them after the hypoglycemia is reversed. Others, especially those lower in the list, remain abnormal even after hypoglycemia is reversed, and can be usefully measured even if a critical specimen is missed.

===Newborn infants===
Hypoglycemia is a common problem in critically ill or extremely low birthweight infants. If not due to maternal [[hyperglycemia]], in most cases it is multifactorial, transient and easily supported. In a minority of cases hypoglycemia turns out to be due to significant hyperinsulinism, hypopituitarism or an inborn error of metabolism and presents more of a management challenge.<ref name="Hypoglycaemia of the Newborn">{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1997/WHO_CHD_97.1.pdf|title=WHO ref. number WHO/CHD/97.1 / WHO/MSM/97.1|year=1997|work=Hypoglycaemia of the Newborn|publisher=World Health Organization|pages=4, 19|accessdate=6 April 2010|location=Geneva}}</ref>

===Young adults===
By far, the most common cause of severe hypoglycemia in this age range is insulin injected for [[type 1 diabetes]]. Circumstances should provide clues fairly quickly for the new diseases causing severe hypoglycemia. All of the congenital metabolic defects, congenital forms of hyperinsulinism, and congenital hypopituitarism are likely to have already been diagnosed or are unlikely to start causing new hypoglycemia at this age. Body mass is large enough to make starvation hypoglycemia and idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia quite uncommon. Recurrent mild hypoglycemia may fit a [[reactive hypoglycemia]] pattern, but this is also the peak age for [[idiopathic postprandial syndrome]], and recurrent "spells" in this age group can be traced to [[orthostatic hypotension]] or [[hyperventilation]] as often as demonstrable hypoglycemia.
*Insulin-induced hypoglycemia
**Insulin injected for type 1 diabetes
**Factitious insulin injection ([[Munchausen syndrome]])
**Insulin-secreting pancreatic tumor
**Reactive hypoglycemia and idiopathic postprandial syndrome
*[[Addison's disease]]
*[[Sepsis]]

===Older adults===
The incidence of hypoglycemia due to complex drug interactions, especially involving oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin for diabetes, rises with age. Though much rarer, the incidence of insulin-producing tumors also rises with advancing age. Most tumors causing hypoglycemia by mechanisms other than insulin excess occur in adults.
*Insulin-induced hypoglycemia
**Insulin injected for diabetes
**Factitious insulin injection ([[Munchausen syndrome]])
**Excessive effects of oral [[Anti-diabetic medication]], beta-blockers, or drug interactions
**Insulin-secreting neuroendocrine tumor ([[insulinoma]]) of the pancreas
**Alcohol induced hypoglycemia often linked with [[ketoacidosis]] (depletion of NAD+ leads to a block of gluconeogenesis)
**Alimentary (rapid jejunal emptying with exaggerated insulin response)
***After gastrectomy [[dumping syndrome]] or bowel bypass surgery or resection
**[[Reactive hypoglycemia]] and idiopathic postprandial syndrome
*Tumor hypoglycemia, [[Doege-Potter syndrome]]
*Acquired [[adrenal insufficiency]]
*Acquired [[hypopituitarism]]

==Pathophysiology of hypoglycemia==
Like most animal tissues, brain [[metabolism]] depends primarily on glucose for fuel in most circumstances. A limited amount of glucose can be derived from [[glycogen]] stored in [[astrocyte]]s, but it is consumed within minutes. For most practical purposes, the brain is dependent on a continual supply of glucose diffusing from the blood into the interstitial tissue within the [[central nervous system]] and into the [[neuron]]s themselves.

Therefore, if the amount of glucose supplied by the blood falls, the brain is one of the first organs affected. In most people, subtle reduction of mental efficiency can be observed when the glucose falls below 65&nbsp;mg/dl (3.6 mM). Impairment of action and judgment usually becomes obvious below 40&nbsp;mg/dl (2.2 mM). Seizures may occur as the glucose falls further. As blood glucose levels fall below 10&nbsp;mg/dl (0.55 mM), most neurons become electrically silent and nonfunctional, resulting in coma. These brain effects are collectively referred to as neuroglycopenia.

The importance of an adequate supply of glucose to the brain is apparent from the number of nervous, hormonal and metabolic responses to a falling glucose level. Most of these are defensive or adaptive, tending to raise the blood sugar via [[glycogenolysis]] and [[gluconeogenesis]] or provide alternative fuels. If the blood sugar level falls too low the liver converts a storage of glycogen into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream, to prevent the person going into a [[diabetic coma]], for a short period of time.

Brief or mild hypoglycemia produces no lasting effects on the brain, though it can temporarily alter brain responses to additional hypoglycemia. Prolonged, severe hypoglycemia can produce lasting damage of a wide range. This can include impairment of cognitive function, motor control, or even consciousness. The likelihood of permanent brain damage from any given instance of severe hypoglycemia is difficult to estimate, and depends on a multitude of factors such as age, recent blood and brain glucose experience, concurrent problems such as [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], and availability of alternative fuels. It has been frequently found that those Type 1 diabetics found "dead in bed" in the morning after suspected severe hypoglycemia had some underlying coronary pathology that led to an induced fatal heart attack.  Recently, several of these individuals found "dead in bed" were wearing Continuous Glucose Monitors, which provided a history of glucose levels prior to the fatal event. It has been found in several cases, that the fatal event was preceded by at least two hours of blood glucose levels under 40&nbsp;mg/dl, possibly lower as the continuous glucose monitors are not accurate at levels below 40&nbsp;mg/dl. The individuals failed to respond to the audible alarms produced by the continuous glucose monitor which may have been "alarming" for many hours prior to the fatal event. The vast majority of symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes result in no detectable permanent harm.<ref>{{Cite book|author=edited by Allen I. Arieff, Robert C. Griggs |title=Metabolic brain dysfunction in systemic disorders |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=0-316-05067-9 |oclc= 24912204|doi=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
When suspected hypoglycemia recurs and a critical specimen has not been obtained, the diagnostic evaluation may take several paths. However good nutrition and prompt intake is essential.

When general health is good, the symptoms are not severe, and the person can fast normally through the night, experimentation with diet (extra snacks with fat or protein, reduced sugar) may be enough to solve the problem. If it is uncertain whether "spells" are indeed due to hypoglycemia, some physicians will recommend use of a home glucose meter to test at the time of the spells to confirm that glucoses are low. This approach may be most useful when spells are fairly frequent or the patient is confident that he or she can provoke a spell. The principal drawback of this approach is the high rate of false positive or equivocal levels due to the imprecision of the currently available meters: both physician and patient need an accurate understanding of what a meter can and cannot do to avoid frustrating and inconclusive results.

In cases of recurrent hypoglycemia with severe symptoms, the best method of excluding dangerous conditions is often a ''diagnostic fast''. This is usually conducted in the hospital, and the duration depends on the age of the patient and response to the fast. A healthy adult can usually maintain a glucose level above 50&nbsp;mg/dl (2.8 mM) for 72 hours, a child for 36 hours, and an infant for 24 hours. The purpose of the fast is to determine whether the person can maintain his or her blood glucose as long as normal, and can respond to fasting with the appropriate metabolic changes. At the end of the fast the insulin should be nearly undetectable and [[ketosis]] should be fully established. The patient's blood glucose levels are monitored and a critical specimen is obtained if the glucose falls. Despite its unpleasantness and expense, a diagnostic fast may be the only effective way to confirm or refute a number of serious forms of hypoglycemia, especially those involving excessive insulin.

A traditional method for investigating suspected hypoglycemia is the oral [[glucose tolerance test]], especially when prolonged to 3, 4, or 5 hours. Although quite popular in the United States in the 1960s, repeated research studies have demonstrated that many healthy people will have glucose levels below 70 or 60 during a prolonged test, and that many types of significant hypoglycemia may go undetected with it. This combination of poor [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] and [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] has resulted in its abandonment for this purpose by physicians experienced in disorders of glucose metabolism.

==Prevention==
The most effective means of preventing further episodes of hypoglycemia depends on the cause.

The risk of further episodes of diabetic hypoglycemia can often (but not always) be reduced by lowering the dose of insulin or other medications, or by more meticulous attention to blood sugar balance during unusual hours, higher levels of exercise, or decreasing alcohol intake.

Many of the inborn errors of metabolism require avoidance or shortening of fasting intervals, or extra carbohydrates. For the more severe disorders, such as type 1 glycogen storage disease, this may be supplied in the form of [[cornstarch]] every few hours or by continuous gastric infusion.

Several treatments are used for [[hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia]], depending on the exact form and severity. Some forms of congenital hyperinsulinism respond to [[diazoxide]] or [[octreotide]]. Surgical removal of the overactive part of the pancreas is curative with minimal risk when hyperinsulinism is focal or due to a benign insulin-producing tumor of the pancreas. When congenital hyperinsulinism is diffuse and refractory to medications, near-total pancreatectomy may be the treatment of last resort, but in this condition is less consistently effective and fraught with more complications.

Hypoglycemia due to hormone deficiencies such as hypopituitarism or adrenal insufficiency usually ceases when the appropriate hormone is replaced.

Hypoglycemia due to dumping syndrome and other post-surgical conditions is best dealt with by altering diet. Including fat and protein with carbohydrates may slow digestion and reduce early insulin secretion. Some forms of this respond to treatment with a [[glucosidase inhibitor]], which slows [[starch]] digestion.

Reactive hypoglycemia with demonstrably low blood glucose levels is most often a predictable nuisance which can be avoided by consuming fat and protein with carbohydrates, by adding morning or afternoon snacks, and reducing alcohol intake.

Idiopathic postprandial syndrome without demonstrably low glucose levels at the time of symptoms can be more of a management challenge. Many people find improvement by changing eating patterns (smaller meals, avoiding excessive sugar, mixed meals rather than carbohydrates by themselves), reducing intake of stimulants such as [[caffeine]], or by making lifestyle changes to reduce stress. See the following section of this article.

==Treatment==
Treatment of some forms of hypoglycemia, such as in diabetes, involves immediately raising the blood sugar to normal through the ingestion of carbohydrates, determining the cause, and taking measures to hopefully prevent future episodes. However, this treatment is not optimal in other forms such as [[reactive hypoglycemia#Treatment|reactive hypoglycemia]], where rapid carbohydrate ingestion may lead to a further hypoglycemic episode.

Blood glucose can be raised to normal within minutes by taking (or receiving) 10-20&nbsp;grams of [[carbohydrate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diabetes.co.uk/Diabetes-and-Hypoglycaemia.html |title=Diabetes and Hypoglycemia |publisher=Diabetes.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref> It can be taken as food or drink if the person is conscious and able to swallow. This amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 3-4 ounces (100-120 ml) of orange, apple, or grape juice although fruit juices contain a higher proportion of fructose which is more slowly metabolized than pure dextrose, alternatively, about 4-5 ounces (120-150 ml) of regular (non-diet) soda may also work, as will about one slice of bread, about 4 crackers, or about 1 serving of most starchy foods. [[Starch]] is quickly digested to glucose (unless the person is taking [[acarbose]]), but adding fat or protein retards digestion. Symptoms should begin to improve within 5 minutes, though full recovery may take 10–20 minutes. Overfeeding does not speed recovery and if the person has diabetes will simply produce hyperglycemia afterwards.  A mnemonic used by the [[American Diabetes Association]] and others is the "rule of 15" - consuming 15 grams of carbohydrate followed by a 15 minute wait, repeated if glucose remains low (variable by individual, sometimes 70 mg/dl).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/parents-and-kids/planet-d/new-to-diabetes/hypoglycemia.html |title=Hypoglycemia - Planet D - American Diabetes Association |publisher=Diabetes.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/low-blood-glucose/MY01267|title=Living with diabetes blog|author=Nancy Klobassa Davidson, R.N., and Peggy Moreland, R.N.|publisher=Mayo Clinic}}</ref>

If a person is suffering such severe effects of hypoglycemia that they cannot (due to combativeness) or should not (due to seizures or unconsciousness) be given anything by mouth, medical personnel such as paramedics, or in-hospital personnel can establish IV access and give intravenous dextrose, concentrations varying depending on age (infants are given 2 ml/kg dextrose 10%, children are given dextrose 25%, and adults are given dextrose 50%). Care must be taken in giving these solutions because they can cause skin necrosis if the IV is infiltrated, sclerosis of veins, and many other fluid and electrolyte disturbances if administered incorrectly. If IV access cannot be established, the patient can be given 1 to 2 milligrams of glucagon in an [[intramuscular injection]]. More treatment information can be found in the article [[diabetic hypoglycemia]].  If a person is suffering less severe effects, and is conscious with the ability to swallow, medical personal such as EMT-B's may administer gelatinous oral glucose.

One situation where starch may be less effective than glucose or sucrose is when a person is taking [[acarbose]]. Since acarbose and other [[alpha-glucosidase inhibitor]]s prevents starch and other sugars from being broken down into [[monosaccharide]]s that can be absorbed by the body, patients taking these medications should consume monosaccharide-containing foods such as glucose tablets, honey, or juice to reverse hypoglycemia.
