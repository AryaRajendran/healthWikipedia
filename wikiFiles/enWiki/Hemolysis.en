'''Hemolysis''' (or '''haemolysis''')—from the Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αἷμα|αἷμα]]}} (aima, haema, [[wikt:haemo-|hemo-]]) meaning "blood" and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:λύσις|λύσις]]}} (lusis, [[wikt:lysis|lysis]], [[wikt:-lysis|-lysis]]) meaning a "loosing", "setting free" or "releasing"<ref>''An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon Founded Upon The Seventh Edition Of Liddell And Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.'' Oxford University Press.</ref>—is the rupturing of [[erythrocyte]]s ([[red blood cell]]s) and the release of their contents ([[cytoplasm]]) into surrounding fluid (''e.g.'', [[blood plasma]]). Hemolysis may occur ''in vivo'' or ''in vitro'' (inside or outside the body).

=={{anchor|''In vivo''}}''In vivo'' (inside the body)==
''[[In vivo]]'' hemolysis can be caused by a large number of medical conditions, including many [[Gram-positive bacteria]] (''e.g.'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'', ''[[Enterococcus]]'', and ''[[Staphylococcus]]''), some parasites (''e.g.'', ''[[Plasmodium]]''), some autoimmune disorders (''e.g.'', drug-induced hemolytic anemia), some genetic disorders (''e.g.'', [[Sickle-cell disease]] or [[G6PD deficiency]]), or blood with too low a solute concentration (hypotonic to cells).

===''Streptococcus''===
{{main|Streptococcus}}
Many species of the genus ''[[Streptococcus]]'' cause hemolysis. Streptococcal bacteria species are classified according to their hemolytic properties. 
* Alpha-hemolytic species, including ''[[S. pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus mitis]]'', ''[[S. mutans]]'', and ''[[S. salivarius]]'', oxidize the iron in the hemoglobin (turning it dark green in culture).
* Beta-hemolytic species, including ''[[S. pyogenes]]'' and ''[[S. agalactiae]]'', completely rupture the red blood cells (visible as a halo in culture).
* Gamma-hemolytic, or non-hemolytic, species do not cause hemolysis and rarely cause illness.

===''Enterococcus''===
{{main|Enterococcus}}
The genus ''[[Enterococcus]]'' includes lactic acid bacteria formerly classified as gamma-hemolytic Group D in the genus streptococcus (see above), including ''E. faecilis'' (''S. faecalis''), ''E. faecium'' (''S. faecium''), ''E. durans'' (''S. durans''), and ''E. avium'' (''S. avium'').

===''Staphylococcus''===
{{main|Staphylococcus}}
''Staphylococcus'' is another Gram-positive cocci. ''[[staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'', the most common cause of "staph" infections, is frequently beta-hemolytic.<ref>[http://www.microbelibrary.org/asmonly/details.asp?id=2037 MicrobeLibrary.org]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}, American Society for Microbiology</ref>

===Parasitic hemolysis===
Because the feeding process of the ''[[Plasmodium]]'' parasites damages red blood cells, [[malaria]] is sometimes called "parasitic hemolysis" in medical literature.

===Hemolytic disease of the newborn===
{{main|Hemolytic disease of the newborn}}
Hemolytic disease of the newborn is an autoimmune disease resulting from the mother's antibodies crossing the placenta to the fetus.

===Hemolytic anemia===
{{main|Hemolytic anemia}}
Because ''in vivo'' hemolysis destroys the red blood cells, in uncontrolled chronic or severe cases it can lead to [[hemolytic anemia]].

===Hemolytic crisis===
A hemolytic crisis, or hyperhemolytic crisis, is characterized by an accelerated rate of red blood cell destruction leading to [[anemia]], [[jaundice]], and [[reticulocytosis]].<ref>[http://www.innvista.com/health/ailments/anemias/sickle.htm Innvista]</ref> Hemolytic crises are a major concern with [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[G6PD deficiency]].

If as little as 0.5% of the red blood cells are hemolyzed, the released hemoglobin will cause the [[blood serum|serum]] or [[blood plasma|plasma]] to appear pale red or cherry red in color.<ref>[http://www.cdha.nshealth.ca/default.aspx?page=SubPage&centerContent.Id.0=21648&category.Categories.1=411 Capital Health]</ref> Note that the hemolyzed sample is transparent, because there are no cells to scatter light.]]
''[[In vitro]]'' hemolysis can be caused by improper technique during collection of blood specimens, by the effects of mechanical processing of blood, or by bacterial action in cultured blood specimens.

===From specimen collection===
Most causes of ''in vitro'' hemolysis are related to specimen collection. Difficult collections, unsecure line connections, contamination, and incorrect needle size, as well as improper tube mixing and incorrectly filled tubes are all frequent causes of hemolysis. Excessive suction can cause the red blood cells to be literally smashed on their way through the [[hypodermic needle]] owing to turbulence and physical forces.  Such hemolysis is more likely to occur when a patient's veins are difficult to find or when they collapse when blood is removed by a syringe or a modern vacuum tube. Experience and proper technique are key for any [[phlebotomist]] or nurse to prevent hemolysis.

''In vitro'' hemolysis during specimen collection can cause inaccurate laboratory test results by contaminating the surrounding plasma with the contents of hemolyzed red blood cells. For example, the concentration of [[potassium]] inside red blood cells is much higher than in the plasma and so an elevated potassium level is usually found in biochemistry tests of hemolyzed blood.

''In vitro'' hemolysis can also occur in a [[blood]] sample because of prolonged storage or storage in incorrect conditions (''i.e.'', too hot or too cold).

==={{anchor|Mechanical blood processing during surgery}}From mechanical blood processing during surgery===
In some surgical procedures (especially some heart operations) where substantial blood loss is expected, machinery is used for [[intraoperative blood salvage]]. A centrifuge process takes blood from the patient, washes the red blood cells with [[normal saline]], and returns them to the patient's blood circulation. Hemolysis may occur if the centrifuge rotates too quickly (generally greater than 500 rpm)—essentially this is hemolysis occurring outside of the body. Unfortunately, increased hemolysis occurs with massive amounts of sudden blood loss, because the process of returning a patient's cells must be done at a correspondingly higher speed to prevent [[hypotension]], [[pH]] imbalance, and a number of other hemodynamic and blood level factors.

==={{anchor|In microbiology}}From bacteria culture===

Visualizing the physical appearance of hemolysis in cultured blood samples may be used as a tool to determine the species of various [[Gram-positive bacteria]] infections (''e.g.'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'').
