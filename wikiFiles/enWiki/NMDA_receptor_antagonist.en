'''NMDA receptor antagonists''' are a class of [[anesthetics]] that work to [[receptor antagonist|antagonize]], or inhibit the action of, the [[NMDA|N-methyl d-aspartate]] receptor ([[NMDA receptor|NMDAR]]). They are used as [[anesthesia]] for animals and, less commonly, for humans; the state of anesthesia they induce is referred to as [[dissociative drug|dissociative anesthesia]]. There is evidence that NMDA receptor antagonists can cause a certain type of [[neurotoxicity]] or [[brain damage]] referred to as [[Olney's Lesions]] in [[rodent]]s, although such damage has never been conclusively observed in [[primate]]s like [[human]]s, however, in adolescent cynomolgus monkeys that were injected daily with the non-competitive NMDA antagonist, [[ketamine]], there were some definite neurologic deficits observed.<ref name="Cynomolgus monkey neurotoxiciy">{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Lin|coauthors=Qi Li, Qing Li, Yuzhe Zhang, Dexiang Liu, Hong Jiang, Fang Pan, David T.

Several synthetic opioids function additionally as NMDAR-antagonists, such as [[Meperidine]], [[Methadone]], [[Dextropropoxyphene]], [[Tramadol]] and [[Ketobemidone]].

Some NMDA receptor antagonists, including but not limited to [[ketamine]] (K), [[dextromethorphan]] (DXM), [[phencyclidine]] (PCP), and [[nitrous oxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O) are popular as [[recreational drug]]s for their dissociative, [[hallucinogen]]ic, and/or [[euphoriant]] properties. When used recreationally, they are classified as [[dissociative drug]]s.

==Neurotoxicity==
{{Main|Olney's lesions}}

Exposure to NMDA receptor antagonists may cause severe brain damage in the [[cingulate cortex]] and [[retrosplenial cortex]] regions of the brain,
but evidence towards this hypothesis is not very strong at the moment. The correlation observed, however, does make sense given the profound abnormalities in bilateral communication between brain hemispheres observed in NMDA antagonist intoxication. In high doses, almost no glutaminergic activity is observed within the [[corpus callosum]], naturally a region primarily [[GABAergic]]. Given a sufficiently long duration of action of the ligand, abnormalities develop in hemisphere communication. The cingulate cortex shifts its balance{{clarify|date=June 2012}} towards the posterior, where hemispheric communication is much more deeply ingrained, due to [[depth perception]]{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}. Through  [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) and [[long-term depression]] (LTD), this can become permanent with regular administration.  While gross structural abnormalities are yet to be observed in humans, likely due to the lack of studies with people under continuous administration, significant cognitive deficits are observed in those who regularly abuse dissociatives. Constant antagonism of NMDA, the primary neurotransmitter involved in LTP, and a major contributor to LTD, results in profound, permanent synaptic abnormalities, even in relatively low doses. The experimental NMDA and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist [[MK-801]] has been shown to cause neural [[vacuolization]] in test rodents that later develop into irreversible lesions called "Olney's Lesions."<ref name="olney">{{Cite journal|author=Olney J, Labruyere J, Price M |title=Pathological changes induced in cerebrocortical neurons by phencyclidine and related drugs |journal=Science |volume=244 |issue=4910 |pages=1360–2 |year=1989 |pmid=2660263 |doi=10.1126/science.2660263}}</ref><ref name="hargreaves">{{Cite journal|author=Hargreaves R, Hill R, Iversen L |title=Neuroprotective NMDA antagonists: the controversy over their potential for adverse effects on cortical neuronal morphology |journal=Acta Neurochir Suppl (Wien) |volume=60 |pages=15–9 |year= 1994|pmid=7976530}}</ref> Many drugs have been found that lessen the risk of neurotoxicity from NMDA receptor antagonists.

==Potential for treatment of excitotoxicity==
Since NMDA receptors are one of the most harmful factors in [[excitotoxicity]], antagonists of the receptors have held much promise for the treatment of conditions that involve excitotoxicity, including [[traumatic brain injury]], [[stroke]], and [[neurodegenerative disease]]s such as [[Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's]], and [[Huntington's]].

==Mechanism of action==
[[Image:NMDA receptor activation and antagonists.PNG|right|thumb|300px|Simplified model of NMDAR activation and various types of NMDAR blockers.<ref name="kim"/>]]

The NMDA receptor is an [[ionotropic receptor]] that allows for the transfer of electrical signals between neurons in the brain and in the spinal column. For electrical signals to pass, the NMDA receptor must be open. To remain open, [[glutamate]] and [[glycine]] must bind to the NMDA receptor. An NMDA receptor that has glycine and glutamate bound to it and has an open ion channel is called "activated."

Chemicals that deactivate the NMDA receptor are called antagonists. NMDAR antagonists fall into four categories: [[Competitive antagonist]]s, which bind to and block the binding site of the [[neurotransmitter]] glutamate; glycine antagonists, which bind to and block the glycine site; noncompetitive antagonists, which inhibit NMDARs by binding to [[allosteric inhibition|allosteric]] sites; and uncompetitive antagonists, which block the ion channel by binding to a site within it.<ref name="kim"/>
