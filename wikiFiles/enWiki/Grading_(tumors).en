In [[pathology]], '''grading''' is a measure of the cell appearance in [[tumor]]s and other [[neoplasm]]s.  Some pathology grading systems apply only to [[malignant]] neoplasms ([[cancer]]); others apply also to [[benign]] neoplasms. The '''neoplastic grading''' is a measure of cell [[anaplasia]] (reversion of [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]]) in the sampled tumor and is based on the resemblance of the tumor to the tissue of origin.<ref>{{cite web|last=Abrams|first=Gerald|title=Neoplasia II|url=http://open.umich.edu/education/med/m1/patientspop-genetics/fall2008/materials|accessdate=24 January 2012}}</ref> Grading in cancer is distinguished from [[cancer staging|staging]], which is a measure of the extent to which the cancer has [[metastasis|spread]].  

Pathology grading systems classify the microscopic cell appearance abnormality and deviations in their rate of growth with the goal of predicting developments at tissue level (see also the 4 major histological changes in [[dysplasia]]).

Cancer is a disorder of '''[[cell cycle|cell life cycle]] alteration''' that leads (non-trivially) to excessive [[cell proliferation]] rates, typically longer cell lifespans and poor differentiation. The grade score (numerical: G1 up to G4) increases with the lack of cellular differentiation - it reflects how much the tumor cells differ from the cells of the normal tissue they have originated from (see [[Grading_(tumors)#Categories|'Categories']] below).  Tumors may be graded on four-tier, three-tier, or two-tier scales, depending on the institution and the tumor type.

The [[histology|histologic]] tumor grade score along with the [[metastasis|metastatic]] (whole-body-level cancer-spread) staging are used to evaluate each specific cancer patient, develop their individual treatment strategy and to predict their prognosis.  A cancer that is very poorly differentiated is called ''[[anaplastic]]''.

==Categories==
The most commonly used system of grading is as per the guidelines of the American Joint Commission on Cancer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} As per their standards, the following are the grading categories.
*GX                Grade cannot be assessed
*G1                Well differentiated (Low grade)
*G2                Moderately differentiated (Intermediate grade)
*G3                Poorly differentiated (High grade)
*G4                Undifferentiated (High grade)

==Systems==
Grading systems are also different for each type of cancer.

Other systems include the Bloom-Richardson system (breast cancer) and the Fuhrman system (kidney cancer).

==Tumor volume estimation==
Experimental cancer studies involve the implantation of tumors subcutaneously in mice.  Such studies require a simple mechanism by which to evaluate tumor burden.  One such method is to approximate the tumor shape by a [[spheroid]].  Two researchers [[blind experiment|blindly measure]] the tumor length ''L'' and width ''W'', in [[millimeter]]s, with [[caliper]]s.  The depth is not measured and is assumed to equal the width ''W''. The tumor's volume in cubic millimeters is then approximately 0.52''W''<sup>2</sup>''L''.<ref>W. Su & Q.
