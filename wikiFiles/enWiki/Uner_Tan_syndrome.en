'''Uner Tan syndrome''', '''Unertan syndrome''' or '''UTS''' is a [[syndrome]] proposed by the [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Üner Tan]]. Persons affected by this syndrome walk with a [[quadrupedal]] locomotion and are afflicted with primitive speech and severe [[mental retardation]]. Tan postulated that this is an example of "[[atavism|backward evolution]]".<ref name=Tan06>{{cite journal |author=Tan U |title=A new syndrome with quadrupedal gait, primitive speech, and severe mental retardation as a live model for human evolution |journal=Int. J. Neurosci. |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=361–9 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16484061 |doi=10.1080/00207450500455330 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207450500455330}}</ref> The proposed syndrome was featured in the 2006 [[BBC2]] documentary ''[[The Family That Walks On All Fours]]''.

==Cases==
=== Ulaş family ===
The [[Ulas family | Ulaş family]] of nineteen from rural southern [[Turkey]] is the main example of the proposed syndrome. Tan described five members as walking with a quadrupedal gait using their feet and the palms of their [[hand]]s. In infants, where this is a rare but a normal stage prior and sometimes following bipedal walking, such a gait is called "bear crawl". The affected family members are also severely mentally retarded and primitive in speech. Tan proposed that these are symptoms of Uner Tan syndrome.<ref name=Tan06/>

However, [[Nicholas Humphrey]], [[John Skoyles (scientist)|John Skoyles]], and [[Roger Keynes]] have argued that their gait is due to two rare phenomena coming together.<ref name = Hand-walkers>{{cite web |author=Humphrey, N., Keynes, R. & Skoyles, J. R. |title=Hand-walkers: five siblings who never stood up |year=2005 |work=Discussion Paper |publisher=Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science |location=London, UK |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/archive/00000463/01/CPNSS2.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> First, instead of initially [[crawling]] as [[infants]] on their [[knees]], they started off [[learning]] to move around with a “bear crawl” on their feet.<ref name = Hand-walkers/> Second, due to their [[congenital]] brain impairment, they found [[Balance (ability)|balancing]] on two [[leg]]s difficult.<ref name = Hand-walkers/> Because of this, their [[motor development]] was channeled into turning their bear crawl into a substitute for [[bipedalism]].<ref name = Hand-walkers/>

Habitually and genetically UTS differs from [[VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia|disequilibrium syndrome]] (DES - Hagberg et al. (1972)), according to one publication.<ref name="cogprints.org">http://cogprints.org/5858/1/UTS_A_CASE_SERIES%2C_IJN%2C_1%2C_1-26%2C_2008.pdf</ref>

=== Four males, two females ===
In January 2008, Tan reported on another family (four males and two females) located in southern Turkey.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tan U, Karaca S, Tan M, ''et al.'' |title=Unertan syndrome: a case series demonstrating human devolution |journal=Int. J. Neurosci. |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18041603 |doi=10.1080/00207450701667857 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207450701667857}}</ref>

===Other===
Four other unrelated cases in families are described in various degrees of UTS among tens of persons. Males are affected more than females.<ref name="cogprints.org"/> Some individuals are unaware of time, lack language, having severe mental retardation with no conscious experience and communicate by murky sounds. Two males are unable to stand up, while in other cases, can stand up but can not make a step when standing. Less severe cases use [[toe walking]], which is a normal phase in child gait development.
