Its causes are numerous and include [[hypovolemia|low blood volume]] from any cause, exposure to [[nephrotoxin|substances harmful to the kidney]], and obstruction of the [[urinary tract]]. AKI is diagnosed on the basis of characteristic laboratory findings, such as elevated [[blood urea nitrogen]] and [[creatinine]], or [[oliguria|inability of the kidneys to produce sufficient amounts of urine]]. 

AKI may lead to a number of complications, including [[metabolic acidosis]], [[hyperkalaemia|high potassium levels]], uremia, changes in body [[fluid balance]], and effects to other [[organ system]]s. Management includes supportive care, such as [[renal replacement therapy]], as well as treatment of the underlying disorder.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of acute kidney injury result from the various disturbances of kidney function that are associated with the disease. Accumulation of urea and other nitrogen-containing substances in the bloodstream lead to a number of symptoms, such as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].<ref name=Skorecki>{{cite book |author=Skorecki K, Green J, Brenner BM |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, ''et al.'' |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=1653–63 |chapter=Chronic renal failure}}</ref> Marked increases in the [[potassium]] level can lead to [[cardiac arrhythmia|irregularities in the heartbeat]], which can be severe and life-threatening.<ref name=Weisberg>{{cite journal |author=Weisberg LS |title=Management of severe hyperkalemia |journal=Crit.

Pain in the flanks may be encountered in some conditions (such as [[thrombosis]] of the renal blood vessels or inflammation of the kidney); this is the result of stretching of the [[renal capsule|fibrous tissue capsule surrounding the kidney]].<ref name=Brady>{{cite book |author=Brady HR, Brenner BM |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, ''et al.'' |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=1644–53 |chapter=Chronic renal failure}}</ref> If the kidney injury is the result of dehydration, there may be [[thirst]] as well as evidence of fluid depletion on [[physical examination]].<ref name=Brady/> Physical examination may also provide other clues as to the underlying cause of the kidney problem, such as a [[rash]] in interstitial nephritis and a palpable [[urinary bladder|bladder]].<ref name=Brady/>

Inability to excrete sufficient fluid from the body can cause accumulation of fluid in the limbs ([[peripheral edema]]) and the lungs ([[pulmonary edema]]),<ref name=Skorecki/> as well as [[cardiac tamponade]] as a result of fluid [[effusion]]s.<ref name=cmdt />

==Causes==
AKI can be caused by disease, [[crush syndrome|crush injury]], [[Contrast-induced nephropathy|contrast agents]], some antibiotics, and more.

The causes of acute kidney injury are commonly categorized into ''prerenal'', ''intrinsic'', and ''postrenal''.

|}

===Prerenal===
''Prerenal'' causes of AKI ("pre-renal azotemia") are those that decrease effective [[renal blood flow|blood flow to the kidney]]. These include systemic causes, such as [[hypovolemia|low blood volume]], [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[heart failure]], local changes to the blood vessels supplying the kidney and even [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|G6PD]]. The latter include [[renal artery stenosis]], or the narrowing of the [[renal artery]] which supplies the kidney,with blood, and [[renal vein thrombosis]], which is the formation of a [[thrombus|blood clot]] in the [[renal vein]] that drains blood from the kidney.

[[Renal ischaemia]] ultimately results in functional disorder, depression of [[Glomerular filtration rate|GFR]], or both. These causes stem from the inadequate cardiac output and hypovolemia or vascular diseases causing reduced perfusion of  both kidneys. Both kidneys need to be affected as one kidney is still more than adequate for normal kidney function.

===Intrinsic===
Sources of damage to the kidney itself are dubbed ''intrinsic''. Intrinsic AKI can be due to damage to the [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomeruli]], [[nephron|renal tubules]], or [[interstitium]]. Common causes of each are [[glomerulonephritis]], [[acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN), and [[acute interstitial nephritis]] (AIN), respectively. A cause of intrinsic acute renal failure is [[tumor lysis syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Jim Cassidy, Donald Bissett, Roy A. J. Spence, Miranda Payne|first=|title=Oxford Handbook of Oncology |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WKoQW4G0g14C&pg=PA706&dq=tumour+lysis+syndrome+acute+renal+failure&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lbigT8KJPMeEgwehjfWmCQ&ved=0CFYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=tumour%20lysis%20syndrome%20acute%20renal%20failure&f=false|date=1 January 2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=706}}</ref>

===Postrenal===
''Postrenal'' AKI is a consequence of [[urinary tract]] obstruction. This may be related to [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], [[kidney stone]]s, obstructed [[urinary catheter]], bladder stone, bladder, ureteral or renal malignancy. It is useful to perform a bladder scan or a post void residual to rule out urinary retention. In post void residual, a catheter is inserted immediately after urinating to measure fluid still in the bladder. 50-100ml suggests neurogenic bladder. A renal ultrasound will demonstrate hydronephrosis if present. A CT scan of the abdomen will also demonstrate bladder distension or hydronephrosis, however, in case of acute renal failure, the use of IV contrast is contraindicated. On the basic metabolic panel, the [[BUN-to-creatinine ratio|ratio of BUN to creatinine]] may indicate post renal failure.

==Diagnosis==
===Detection===
The deterioration of renal function may be discovered by a measured decrease in urine output. Often, it is diagnosed on the basis of [[blood test]]s for substances normally eliminated by the kidney: [[urea]] and [[creatinine]]. Both tests have their disadvantages. For instance, it takes about 24 hours for the creatinine level to rise, even if both kidneys have ceased to function. A number of alternative markers has been proposed (such as [[NGAL]], [[KIM-1]], [[Interleukin 18|IL18]] and [[cystatin C]]), but none are currently established enough to replace creatinine as a marker of renal function.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} {{When|date=April 2011}}

Sodium and potassium, two electrolytes that are commonly deranged in people with acute kidney injury, are typically measured together with urea and creatinine.{{citation needed | date=April 2011}}

===Further testing===
Once the diagnosis of AKI is made, further testing is often required to determine the underlying cause. These may include urine sediment analysis, [[renal ultrasound]] and/or [[kidney biopsy]]. Indications for renal biopsy in the setting of AKI include:<ref name="isbn0-07-159124-9">{{cite book |author=Papadakis MA, McPhee SJ |title=Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-07-159124-9}}</ref>
# Unexplained AKI
# AKI in the presence of the [[nephritic syndrome]]
# Systemic disease associated with AKI

==Classification==
Acute kidney injury is diagnosed on the basis of [[clinical history]] and laboratory data. A diagnosis is made when there is rapid reduction in [[renal function|kidney function]], as measured by serum [[creatinine]], or based on a rapid reduction in urine output, termed [[oliguria]].

===Definition===
Introduced by the [[Acute Kidney Injury Network]] (AKIN), specific criteria exist for the diagnosis of AKI:<ref name="pmid17331245">{{cite journal |author=Mehta RL, Kellum JA, Shah SV, ''et al.'' |title=Acute Kidney Injury Network: report of an initiative to improve outcomes in acute kidney injury |journal=Critical Care (London, England) |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=R31 |year=2007 |pmid=17331245 |pmc=2206446 |doi=10.1186/cc5713 |url=http://ccforum.com/content/11/2/R31}}</ref>
# Rapid time course (less than 48 hours)
# Reduction of kidney function
#* Rise in serum [[creatinine]], defined by either:
#** Absolute increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.3&nbsp;mg/dl (≥26.4 μmol/l)
#** Percentage increase in serum creatinine of ≥50%
#* Reduction in urine output, defined as <0.5 ml/kg/hr for more than 6 hours

===Staging===
The ''RIFLE criteria'', proposed by the [[Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative]] (ADQI) group, aid in the staging of patients with AKI:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bellomo R, Ronco C, Kellum JA, Mehta RL, Palevsky P |title=Acute renal failure - definition, outcome measures, animal models, fluid therapy and information technology needs: the Second International Consensus Conference of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Group |journal=Crit Care |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=R204–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15312219 |pmc=522841 |doi=10.1186/cc2872 |url=http://ccforum.com/content/8/4/R204}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lameire N, Van Biesen W, Vanholder R |title=Acute renal failure |journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] |volume=365 |issue=9457 |pages=417–30 |year=2005 |pmid=15680458 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17831-3}}</ref>
* Risk: GFR decrease >25%, serum creatinine increased 1.5 times or urine production of <0.5 ml/kg/hr for 6 hours
* Injury: GFR decrease >50%, doubling of creatinine or urine production <0.5 ml/kg/hr for 12 hours
* Failure: GFR decrease >75%, tripling of creatinine or creatinine >355 μmol/l (with a rise of >44) (>4&nbsp;mg/dl) OR urine output below 0.3 ml/kg/hr for 24 hours
* Loss: persistent AKI or complete loss of [[renal function|kidney function]] for more than 4 weeks
* [[End-stage renal disease]]: need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) for more than 3 months

==Treatment==
The management of AKI hinges on identification and treatment of the underlying cause. In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder, management of AKI routinely includes the avoidance of substances that are toxic to the kidneys, called [[nephrotoxin]]s. These include [[NSAID]]s such as [[ibuprofen]], [[iodinated contrast]]s such as those used for [[CT scan]]s, many [[antibiotics]] such as [[gentamicin]], and a range of other substances.<ref name=pmid18492867 /> 

Monitoring of renal function, by serial serum creatinine measurements and monitoring of urine output, is routinely performed. In the hospital, insertion of a [[urinary catheterization|urinary catheter]] helps monitor urine output and relieves possible bladder outlet obstruction, such as with an enlarged prostate.

===Specific therapies===
In prerenal AKI without [[hypervolemia|fluid overload]], administration of [[intravenous fluid]]s is typically the first step to improve renal function. Volume status may be monitored with the use of a [[central venous catheter]] to avoid over- or under-replacement of fluid.

Should [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] prove a persistent problem in the fluid-replete patient, [[inotrope]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] and [[dobutamine]] may be given to improve [[cardiac output]] and hence renal perfusion. While a useful pressor, there is no evidence to suggest that [[dopamine]] is of any specific benefit,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holmes CL, Walley KR |title=Bad medicine: low-dose dopamine in the ICU |journal=Chest |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=1266–75 |year=2003 |pmid=12684320|doi=10.1378/chest.123.4.1266}}</ref> and may be harmful.

The myriad causes of intrinsic AKI require specific therapies. For example, intrinsic AKI due to [[Wegener's granulomatosis]] may respond to [[steroid]] medication. Toxin-induced prerenal AKI often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent, such as [[aminoglycoside]], [[penicillin]], NSAIDs, or [[paracetamol]].<ref name=Brady />

If the cause is obstruction of the urinary tract, relief of the obstruction (with a [[nephrostomy]] or [[urinary catheter]]) may be necessary.

===Diuretic agents===
The use of [[diuretics]] such as [[furosemide]], is widespread and sometimes convenient in ameliorating fluid overload, and is not associated with higher mortality (risk of death).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Uchino S, Doig GS, Bellomo R, ''et al'' |title=Diuretics and mortality in acute renal failure |journal=Crit. Care Med. |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=1669–77 |year=2004 |pmid=15286542|doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000132892.51063.2F}}</ref>

===Renal replacement therapy===
[[Renal replacement therapy]], such as with [[hemodialysis]], may be instituted in some cases of AKI. A systematic review of the literature in 2008 demonstrated no difference in outcomes between the use of [[intermittent hemodialysis]] and [[continuous venovenous hemofiltration]] (CVVH).<ref name="pmid18285591">{{cite journal |author=Pannu N, Klarenbach S, Wiebe N, Manns B, Tonelli M |title=Renal replacement therapy in patients with acute renal failure: a systematic review |journal=JAMA : the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=299 |issue=7 |pages=793–805 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18285591 |doi=10.1001/jama.299.7.793 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18285591}}</ref> Among critically ill patients, intensive renal replacement therapy with CVVH does not appear to improve outcomes compared to less intensive intermittent hemodialysis.<ref name="pmid18492867">{{cite journal |author=Palevsky PM, Zhang JH, O'Connor TZ, ''et al.'' |title=Intensity of renal support in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=359 |issue=1 |pages=7–20 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18492867 |pmc=2574780 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0802639 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=18492867&promo=ONFLNS19}}</ref><ref name="pmid19846848">{{cite journal |author=Bellomo R, Cass A, Cole L, ''et al.'' |title=Intensity of continuous renal-replacement therapy in critically ill patients |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=361 |issue=17 |pages=1627–38 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19846848 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0902413 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=19846848&promo=ONFLNS19}}</ref>

===Complications===
[[Metabolic acidosis]], [[hyperkalemia]], and [[pulmonary edema]]<ref>http://beavermedic.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/the-kidneys/</ref> may require medical treatment with [[sodium bicarbonate]], antihyperkalemic measures, and diuretics.

Lack of improvement with [[Fluid replacement|fluid resuscitation]], therapy-resistant hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or fluid overload may necessitate [[renal replacement therapy|artificial support]] in the form of [[dialysis]] or [[hemofiltration]].<ref name=Weisberg/>

==Prognosis==
Depending on the cause, a proportion of patients will never regain full renal function, thus entering [[end-stage renal failure]] and requiring lifelong dialysis or a [[kidney transplant]]. Patients with AKI are more likely to die prematurely after they were discharged from hospital even if their kidney function has recovered.<ref name=harrison18 />

==Epidemiology==
Acute kidney injury is common among hospitalized patients. It affects some 3-7% of patients admitted to the hospital and approximately 25-30% of patients in the [[intensive care unit]].<ref name="isbn1-4160-3110-3">{{cite book |author= |title=Brenner and Rector's The Kidney |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-3110-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==History==
Before the advancement of [[modern medicine]], acute kidney injury was referred to as ''uremic poisoning'' while [[uremia]] was contamination of the [[blood]] with [[urine]]. Starting around 1847, ''uremia'' came to be used for reduced urine output, a condition now called [[oliguria]], which was thought to be caused by the urine's mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the [[urethra]].{{citation needed | date=April 2011}}

Acute kidney injury due to [[acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN) was recognised in the 1940s in [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], where [[Crush syndrome|crush injury]] victims during the [[London Blitz]] developed patchy necrosis of renal tubules, leading to a sudden decrease in renal function.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bywaters EG, Beall D |title=Crush injuries with impairment of renal function. |journal=[[British Medical Journal|Br Med J]] |volume= 1|issue=4185 |pages=427–32 |year=1941 |pmid=20783577 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.4185.427|pmc=2161734}}</ref> During the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam wars]], the incidence of AKI decreased due to better acute management and administration of [[intravenous fluid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schrier RW, Wang W, Poole B, Mitra A |title=Acute renal failure: definitions, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and therapy |journal=J.
