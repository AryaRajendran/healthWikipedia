==Biography==
Paracelsus was born and raised in the village of [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]] in [[Switzerland]]. His father, Wilhelm Bombast von [[Hohenheim]], was a [[Swabia]]n ([[Germans|German]]) chemist and physician. His mother was [[Switzerland|Swiss]]; she presumably died in his childhood.<ref name="BBKL">{{BBKL|p/paracelsus|band=6|autor=Johannes Schaber|artikel=Paracelsus, lat. Pseudonym von {Philippus Aureolus} Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim|spalten=1502-1528}}</ref> In 1502 the family moved to [[Villach]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] where Paracelsus' father worked as a physician.<ref name="BBKL"/> He received a profound humanistic and theological education by his father, local clerics and the convent school of [[St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal]].<ref name="BBKL"/> At the age of 16 he started studying medicine at the [[University of Basel]], later moving to Vienna. He gained his [[doctorate]] degree from the [[University of Ferrara]] in 1515 or 1516.<ref name="BBKL"/><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://web.unife.it/centro/paracelsus/archivi/c_2005_hexagon_winter2005.pdf |format=PDF |author1= Marshall James L |author2=Marshall Virginia R

His wanderings as an itinerant physician and sometime journeyman miner<ref>{{cite book|author=Conner Clifford D |title=A peoples history of science |place=New York: miners, midwives, and 'low mechanicks' |publisher=Nation Books |year=2005 |isbn=1-56025-748-2 |oclc=62164511 |pages=306}}</ref> took him through Germany, France, Spain, Hungary, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Russia.

As a physician of the early 16th century, Paracelsus held a natural affinity with the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]], [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]], and [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] philosophies central to the Renaissance, a world-view exemplified by [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]]. Paracelsus rejected the [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] theories of [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Nicholas Flamel|Flamel]] in his ''Archidoxes of Magic''. [[Astrology]] was a very important part of Paracelsus' medicine, and he was a practicing [[astrologer]] — as were many of the university-trained physicians working at this time in Europe. Paracelsus devoted several sections in his writings to the construction of astrological talismans for curing disease, providing talismans for various maladies as well as talismans for each sign of the [[Zodiac]]. He also invented an alphabet called the [[Alphabet of the Magi]], for engraving angelic names upon [[amulet|talisman]]s.

Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in [[medicine]]. He used the name "zink" for the element [[zinc]] in about 1526, based on the sharp pointed appearance of its crystals after smelting and the old German word "zinke" for pointed. He used experimentation in learning about the [[human anatomy|human body]]. Paracelsus was also responsible for the creation of [[laudanum]], an opium tincture very common until the 19th century.

Paracelsus gained a reputation for being arrogant, and soon garnered the anger of other physicians in Europe. He held the chair of medicine at the [[University of Basel]] for less than a year; while there his colleagues became angered by allegations that he had publicly burned traditional medical books. He was forced from the city after a legal dispute over a physician's fee he sued to collect. In 1530, at the instigation of the medical faculty at the [[University of Leipzig]], the city council of [[Nürnberg]] prohibited the printing of Paracelsus' works.

He then wandered [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia Minor]] in the pursuit of hidden knowledge. He revised old manuscripts and wrote new ones but had trouble finding publishers. In 1536, his ''[[Die grosse Wundartznei]]'' (The Great Surgery Book) was published and enabled him to regain fame.
Paracelsus' contributions to medicine can be seen in the context of the birth of Lutheranism. He was a contemporary of Copernicus, Da Vinci, and Martin Luther.<ref name="toxsci.oxfordjournals.org"/> During his life he was compared with Luther partly because his ideas were different from the mainstream and partly because of openly defiant acts against the existing authorities in medicine, such as his public burning of ancient books. This act struck people as similar to Luther's defiance against the Church.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/442424/Paracelsus/5504/Career-at-Basel</ref> Paracelus rejected that comparison.<ref>title=Paracelsus: An Introduction to Philosophical Medicine in the Era of the Renaissance | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wO244WXEBKcC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=paracelsus+luther&source=bl&ots=pxqrFS_UGB&sig=_PTalHaeyVwk29ioqnnfeQNyBHY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lZlqUajGIMqZ0QG2soCABQ&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=paracelsus%20luther&f=false | page=40</ref> Famously Paracelus said, "I leave it to Luther to defend what he says and I will be responsible for what I say. That which you wish to Luther, you wish also to me: You wish us both in the fire."<ref>http://divinity.uchicago.edu/martycenter/publications/sightings/archive_2006/1023.shtml</ref>

He died at the age of 47 of natural causes, and his remains were buried according to his wishes in the cemetery at the church of St. Sebastian in Salzburg. His remains are now located in a tomb in the porch of the church.

After his death, the movement of [[Paracelsianism]] was seized upon by many wishing to subvert the traditional [[Galen]]ic physics, and his therapies became more widely known and used.

His [[motto]] was "Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest" which means "Let no man belong to another who can belong to himself."

==Philosophy==
Paracelsus believed in the Greek concept of the [[Classical element#Classical elements in Greece|four elements]], but he also introduced the idea that, on another level, the cosmos is fashioned from three spiritual substances: the ''tria prima'' of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[sulfur]], and [[salt]]. These substances were not the simple substances we recognise today, but were rather broad [[Principle (chemistry)|principles]] that gave every object both its inner essence and outward form. Mercury represented the transformative agent (fusibility and volatility); sulfur represented the binding agent between substance and transformation (flammability); and salt represented the solidifying/substantiating agent (fixity and noncombustibility). For example, when a piece of wood is burnt, the products reflect its constitution: smoke reflects mercury, flame reflects sulfur, and ash reflects salt.<ref name="Read"/>

The ''tria prima'' also defined the human identity. Sulfur embodied the soul, (the emotions and desires); salt represented the body; mercury epitomised the spirit (imagination, moral judgment, and the higher mental faculties). By understanding the chemical nature of the ''tria prima'', a physician could discover the means of curing disease.

==Contributions to medicine==

Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine. His [[Hermeticism|hermetical]] views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man ([[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]) and Nature ([[macrocosm]]). He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.  (Debus & Multhauf, p.&nbsp;6-12)

As a result of this hermetical idea of harmony, the universe's macrocosm was represented in every person as a microcosm. According to the insights at the time, there were Seven planets in the sky, Seven metals on Earth and Seven centers (or major organs) in Man  — seven was a special number. Everything was heavenly and closely interrelated (see table below).

Diseases were caused by poisons brought here from the stars. But 'poisons' were not necessarily something negative, in part because related substances interacted, in part because only the dose determined if a substance was poisonous or not. Evil could expel evil. Therefore, poisons could have beneficial medical effects. Because everything in the universe was interrelated, beneficial medical substances could be found in herbs, minerals and various chemical combinations thereof. Paracelsus viewed the universe as one coherent organism pervaded by a uniting lifegiving spirit, and this in its entirety, Man included, was 'God'. His views put him at odds with the Church, for which there necessarily had to be a difference between the Creator and the created.<ref>{{cite book | author= Alex Wittendorff, Claus Bjørn, Ole Peter Grell, T. Morsing, Per Barner Darnell, Hans Bjørn, Gerhardt Eriksen, Palle Lauring, Kristian Hvidt |title = Tyge Brahe |language=Danish | publisher = Gad  | year = 1994 |isbn=87-12-02272-1 }} p44-45</ref>

He summarised his own views:
{{cquote|Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of [[gold]] and [[silver]]. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.(Edwardes, p.&nbsp;47) (also in: [[Eric John Holmyard|Holmyard, Eric John]]. ''Alchemy''. p.&nbsp;170)}}
[[Hippocrates]] put forward the theory that illness was caused by an imbalance of the [[humorism|four humours]]: blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile. These ideas were further developed by [[Galen]] into an extremely influential and highly persistent set of medical beliefs that were to last until the mid-1850s. The dominant medical treatments in Paracelsus' time were specific diets to help in the "cleansing of the putrefied juices" combined with purging and [[bloodletting]] to restore the balance of the four humours. Paracelsus supplemented and challenged this view with his beliefs that illness was the result of the body being attacked by ''outside'' agents.

Paracelsus' major work ''On the Miners' Sickness and Other Diseases of Miners''  documented the occupational hazards of metalworking including treatment and prevention strategies. He also wrote a book on the human body contradicting [[Galen]]'s ideas.

==Contributions to toxicology==

[[File:Einsiedeln IMG 6265.JPG|thumb|Memorial in [[Einsiedeln]], Switzerland]]

Paracelsus, sometimes called the father of [[toxicology]], wrote:<ref>p. 435, ''Verkehrsmedizin: Fahreignung, Fahrsicherheit, Unfallrekonstruktion'', B. Madea, F. Mußhoff, and G. Berghaus, Köln: Deutscher Ärzte-Verlag, 2007, ISBN 3-7691-0490-0.</ref>

:{{lang-de|Alle Ding' sind Gift, und nichts ohn' Gift; allein die Dosis macht, daß ein Ding kein Gift ist.}}
:"All things are poison, and nothing is without poison; only the dose permits something not to be poisonous."
Or, more commonly
:"[[The dose makes the poison]]."

That is to say, substances considered toxic are harmless in small doses, and conversely an ordinarily harmless substance can be deadly if over-consumed.

==Contributions to psychotherapy==
Paracelsus is credited as providing the first clinical/scientific mention of the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]]. In his work ''Von den Krankeiten'' he writes: "Thus, the cause of the disease chorea lasciva is a mere opinion and idea, assumed by imagination, affecting those who believe in such a thing. This opinion and idea are the origin of the disease both in children and adults. In children the case is also imagination, based not on thinking but on perceiving, because they have heard or seen something. The reason is this: their sight and hearing are so strong that unconsciously they have fantasies about what they have seen or heard." <ref>{{Citation |title=The History of Psychotherapy: From Healing Magic to Encounter |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7VGgQi3NJY8C&pg=PA200&lpg=PA200&dq=their+sight+and+hearing+are+so+strong+that+unconsciously+they+have+fantasies+about+what+they+have+seen+or+heard&source=bl&ots=MiHOjTQJRr&sig=EBI3Gcz0Bi_Dbi0dSfthNu88q7U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d5FqUbHkCKa_0AHHvYCYBA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=their%20sight%20and%20hearing%20are%20so%20strong%20that%20unconsciously%20they%20have%20fantasies%20about%20what%20they%20have%20seen%20or%20heard&f=false |page=200}}</ref>

==Legend and rumour==
Many books mentioning Paracelsus also cite him as the origin of the word "bombastic" to describe his often arrogant speaking style, which the following passage illustrates:

{{Quotation|I am Theophrastus, and greater than those to whom you liken me; I am Theophrastus, and in addition I am ''monarcha medicorum'' and I can prove to you what you cannot prove...I need not don a coat of mail or a buckler against you, for you are not learned or experienced enough to refute even a word of mine...As for you, you can defend your kingdom with belly-crawling and flattery. How long do you think this will last?...Let me tell you this: every little hair on my neck knows more than you and all your scribes, and my shoe buckles are more learned than your Galen and Avicenna, and my beard has more experience than all your high colleges. |Paracelsus|Selected Writings <ref>Paracelsus, ''Selected Writings'', ed. with an introduction by Jolande Jacobi, trans. Norbert Guterman, (New York: Pantheon, 1951), p. 79-80</ref>}}

According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the origin of the word "bombastic" is "bombast", an old term for cotton stuffing, rather than a play on Paracelsus's middle name, Bombastus.
