However, the stomach is a very common extranodal site for lymphomas (lymphomas originating somewhere else with [[metastasis]] to stomach).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aisenberg AC |title=Coherent view of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma |journal=J.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most of the people primary gastric lymphoma affects are over 60 years old.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thirlby RC |title=Gastrointestinal lymphoma: a surgical perspective |journal=Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.) |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=29–32, 34; discussion 34, 37–8 |year=1993 |month=January |pmid=8420540 }}</ref> Symptoms include [[epigastric]] pain, early satiety, fatigue and weight loss.

===Risk factors===
Risk factors for gastric lymphoma include the following:
*''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Parsonnet J, Hansen S, Rodriguez L, ''et al.'' |title=''Helicobacter pylori'' infection and gastric lymphoma |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=330 |issue=18 |pages=1267–71 |year=1994 |month=May |pmid=8145781 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199405053301803 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/330/18/1267}}</ref>
*Long-term immunosuppressant drug therapy
*[[HIV]] infection

==Diagnosis==
These lymphomas are difficult to differentiate from [[gastric carcinoma|gastric adenocarcinoma]]. The lesions are usually ulcers with a ragged, thickened [[mucosa]]l pattern on [[Radiography#Medicine|contrast radiograph]]s.

The diagnosis is typically made by [[biopsy]] at the time of [[gastroscopy|endoscopy]].  Several endoscopic findings have been reported, including solitary ulcers, thickened gastric folds, mass lesions and nodules.  As there may be infiltration of the submucosa, larger [[biopsy]] [[forceps]], [[endoscopic ultrasound]] guided biopsy, [[endoscopic mucosal resection|endoscopic submucosal resection]], or [[laparotomy]] may be required to obtain tissue.

Imaging investigations including [[Computed tomography|CT]] scans or [[endoscopic ultrasound]] are useful to stage disease.  Hematological parameters are usually checked to assist with staging and to exclude concomitant [[leukemia]].  An elevated [[lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]] level may be suggestive of lymphoma.

==Pathophysiology==
The majority of gastric lymphomas are [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] of [[B-cell]] origin.  These tumors may range from well-differentiated, superficial involvements ([[Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue|MALT]]) to high-grade, large-cell lymphomas. Sometimes, it's hard to differentiate poorly differentiated high grade B-cell gastric lymphoma from gastric adenocarcinoma clinically or radiologically, yet histopathology with [[immunohistochemistry]] is recommended to stain specific markers on the malignant cell that favor the diagnosis of lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry stains specific clusters of differentiation that are present on B-cells like [[CD20]]. [[Cytokeratin]] is also a surface marker that is presented on epithelial cells, is stained histochemically and favors the diagnosis of epithelial tumors like adenocarcinoma. 

Differentiating poor gastric lymphoma from adenocarcinoma is essential because the prognosis and modalities of treatment differ significantly. 

Other lymphomas involving the stomach include [[mantle cell lymphoma]] and [[T-cell lymphomas]] which may be associated with [[enteropathy]]; the latter usually occur in the [[small bowel]] but have been reported in the stomach.

==Treatment==
Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of the stomach are primarily treated with [[chemotherapy]] with [[CHOP]] with or without [[rituximab]] being a usual first choice.
Antibiotic treatment to eradicate [[H. pylori]] is indicated as first line therapy for [[MALT lymphoma]]s.  About 60% of MALT lymphomas completely regress with eradication therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bayerdörffer E, Neubauer A, Rudolph B, ''et al.'' |title=Regression of primary gastric lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type after cure of ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection.

Second line therapy for MALT lymphomas is usually chemotherapy with a single agent, and complete response rates of greater than 70% have been reported.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hammel P, Haioun C, Chaumette MT, ''et al.'' |title=Efficacy of single-agent chemotherapy in low-grade B-cell mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma with prominent gastric expression |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=2524–9 |year=1995 |month=October |pmid=7595703 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7595703}}</ref>

Subtotal [[gastrectomy]], with post-operative [[chemotherapy]] is undertaken in refractory cases, or in the setting of complications, including [[gastric outlet obstruction]].
