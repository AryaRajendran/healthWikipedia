'''Emergency Medical Services''' ({{lang-pl|Ratownictwo Medyczne}}, RM) in [[Poland]] is a service of public pre-hospital emergency healthcare, including (but not limited to) [[ambulance]] service, provided by individual Polish cities and counties.  These services are typically provided by the local, publicly operated hospital, and funded by the government of Poland.  In a number of cases, the hospitals contract these services to private operators. In addition to publicly funded services, there are also a variety of private-for-profit ambulance services operating independently, as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.falck.com/_emergency|title=Falck Website|accessdate=2009-01-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080803030028/http://www.falck.com/_emergency <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-08-03}}</ref>

==Standards==
===Operating system===

At the moment, the operating system of Polish [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] is similar of the Austrian- Franco-German-Spanish delivery model, and is physician-led and an Integrated EMS of Public Health (IEMS).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cooke MW, Bridge P, Wilson S.|title=Variation in emergency ambulance dispatch in Western Europe|journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Trauma and Emergency Medicine|volume=9|issue=2|pages=57–66|year=2001}}</ref> Physicians (usually [[anaesthetists]]) respond to most emergency calls, and a great deal of definitive care and even simple physician consultation and discharge occur at the scene. These physicians are often referred to as '''Emergency Physicians'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medycynaratunkowa.com.pl/|title=Polish Society for Emergency Medicine website (in Polish)|accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref> [[Emergency medicine]] has been recognized as a medical specialty since 1999. Due to shortage of specialists in emergency medicine, selected other medical specialists (anesthesiology and intensive care, internal diseases, general surgery, pediatrics, pediatric surgery, orthopaedics and traumatology) are allowed to work in the system until 2020. Unlike the [[Emergency medical services in Germany|German]] system, the physicians do not respond in separate vehicles, instead staffing the appropriate types of ambulances directly.  Transportation to [[hospital]] may, or may not, be an outcome it depends of decision the [[MICU]] Physician . The variation occurs in that the [[physician]] may be supported by either [[paramedics]] or [[nurses]], or some mix of the two roles.  Each [[ambulance]] also has a dedicated Ambulance Technician who drives, with minimal medical training.  As the system evolves, however, it will be changing.  Paramedic-led ambulances will respond to most emergency calls, as in the Anglo-American model,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dick WF |title=Anglo-American vs. Franco-German  emergency medical services system |journal=Prehosp Disaster Med |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=29–35; discussion 35–7 |year=2003 |pmid=14694898 |doi= |url=}}</ref> with physicians being "sent" only to those calls where there is a potential critical threat to life.

===Vehicles and equipment===
Poland has voluntarily adopted the majority of the specifications for ambulances of [[European Standard]] [[CEN 1789]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Committee on European Standards|journal=Cen En 1789|title=Medical Vehicles and their Equipment 2|year=2007|url=https://www.on-norm.at/ecom/preview.dyn;jsessionid=2BUDS0AIYXPK4CQCAICCFEQ?PROD_ID=268318&SKU_ID=268318911|format=}} {{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref> Ambulances and equipment used do comply with the technical standards outlined.  While design and technical standards are voluntarily complied with, there is no current compliance with the visual identity standards described in the Standard.  There are also no immediate plans to do so.  While plans are in place for the restructuring of some aspects of the EMS system, these are mostly related to staffing configurations and deployment, which are not covered by the technical Standard.  It appears unlikely that the proposed changes will have any effect on Standard compliance.

===Training===
Since 2006, the evolving legal standard of training for Polish paramedics is a three-year Bachelor's degree.  As an option, those with substantial prior experience may proceed to a degree, following two years of additional study.  This program is available in a number of Polish universities, and will completely replace the prior training standard, which consisted of an assortment of short courses.  Short courses of various types continue to be offered, but these are now essentially the typical short courses found elsewhere in EMS, including [[Advanced Cardiac Life Support]] and [[Pediatric Advanced Life Support]], among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&sl=pl&u=http://www.ratownik-med.prv.pl/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=2&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3DRatownictwo%2BMedyczne%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG|title= Polish EMS Education website|accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref>

==System configuration ==
=== Ratownictwo Medyczne service delivery units ===
*''Pogotowie Ratunkowe'' (EMS stations)
*''Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe'' (LPR) (Air ambulance stations)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&sl=pl&u=http://www.lpr.com.pl/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3DLotnicze%2BPogotowie%2BRatunkowe%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX|title=LPR website (translated from Polish)|accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref>
*Fire Brigade - In the Polish system [[firefighters]] provide a level of '''tiered response''' to assist Polish EMS in exceptional circumstances, including fires and motor vehicle accidents.  The training provided to Polish firefighters is limited to [[first aid]] and what might be described as [[ABC (medicine)]].  As a result, their participation in emergency medical responses is less common than what those in [[North America]] would be accustomed to.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kgpsp.gov.pl/?lang=EN|title=Polish National Fire Service website (translated from Polish)|accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref>

===Vehicles===
====Land ambulance====
The vehicles of the Polish EMS system come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. As a member of the [[European Union]], Poland has decided to ratify most aspects of the requirements of European standard CEN 1789 for ambulances, as reflected in the Polish EN 1789 (Classes A-C) Standard.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ferreira, Hignett, JS |title=Reviewing Ambulance Design for Clinical Efficiency and Paramedic Safety|journal=Applied Ergonomics|volume= 36|year=2005|pages=97–105|url=http://amp.osu.edu/CT/download/Journal%20Club/jc_051605_mo.pdf| doi = 10.1016/j.apergo.2004.07.003 |pmid=15627427 }}</ref>  The visual identity requirements of the European standard for ambulances are not yet being followed.
The three major types of vehicle are:
*The patient transport ambulance '''(T)''', which is smaller, conforms to European Class A, and contains fewer staff and less equipment.
*The ''ambulans reanimacyjny'' '''(R)''' (English: [[resuscitation]] [[ambulance]]),  is a larger van used for serious emergencies. This unit type is the first choice for response to emergencies that appear to be immediately life-threatening. While some CEN 1789 Class B vehicles are still present in the system, the objective is to ultimately ensure that this type of ambulance is always a Class C.
*The ''ambulans wypadkowy'' '''(W)'''  (English: emergency ambulance), is a van-type ambulance used for emergencies when a Type R ambulance is unavailable. They are used for physician consultation calls or for non-emergency transport. These vehicles conform to the CEN 1789 Class B standard, although sometimes Class C ambulances are seen in this role.

In addition, the system also operates specialty ambulances which are equipped for and dedicated to [[neonatal]] transport (Type '''N'''), which are not used for any other purpose.

====Air ambulance====
{{Out of date|section|date=March 2013}}
Polish Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe (LPR) currently operates about 18 [[helicopter]] [[air ambulance]]s strategically located in large cities throughout Poland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lpr.com.pl/pl/start.html|title=LPR homepage (in Polish)|accessdate=2009-01-03}}</ref>  In addition, fixed wing aircraft are used for longer distance transports.  Many of the aircraft used continue to be of the old era of Soviet domination, however, this is gradually changing.  The government of Poland placed an order for 23 new [[Eurocopter EC135|Eurocopter EC-135]] aircraft in August 2008, with delivery expected in 2009–2010. Now (December 2010) LPR use 13 new [[Eurocopter EC135|EC-135]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eads.com/1024/en/pressdb/pressdb/Eurocopter/20080630_ec_poland_ec135.html|title=Poland's Ministry of Health Orders 23 EC-135s for Nationwide Emergency Medical Service|accessdate=2009-01-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  These will replace all of the old Soviet-era aircraft, and will bring Poland into full compliance with the existing European Standard '''JAR OPS-3''' for air ambulances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.le-webmag.com/article.php3?id_article=126&lang=en|title=Helicopter Aeromedical Transport:  The Advent of JAR OPS3|accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref>

==== Equipment ====
[[Image:Wypadek zabezpieczenie głowy poszkodowanej.JPG|thumb|250 px|Polish paramedics at work]]
The basic required equipment of the Type R and Type W ambulances (and in the future the Type S and Type P ambulances) is as follows.  This equipment is obligatory and represents minimal requirements:

* Basic [[First Aid]] kit.
* Dressings and Bandages
* Spinal immobilization equipment such as [[Cervical collar]]s or [[Long spine board|spine boards]]
* Mobile [[medical ventilator]]
* Basic diagnostic equipment, such as blood-pressure cuffs
* Portable [[defibrillator]]
* [[Electrocardiogram|ECG monitor]]
* Equipment for [[intravenous therapy]]
* [[Gurney]] and blankets
* Flexible [[stretcher]], also called a Reeves stretcher
* Rigid or collapsible transport chair (called a stair chair in the [[United States]])
* [[Rescue]] equipment

===Communications===
All ambulances in Poland are dispatched from centralized regional dispatch centers (Polish: ''Centrum Powiadamiania Ratunkowego'')(CPR).  The traditional standardized [[emergency telephone number]] for ambulances in Poland in the [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] telephone system is '''999'''.  The standard '''European Emergency Number''', [[1-1-2]] also works in Poland, including mobile systems, and is gradually replacing '''999'''. Calls are then triaged by interview process, and the closest and most correct type of ambulance resource is sent to the call.
E112 is a location-enhanced version of 112. The telecom operator transmits the location information to the emergency centre. The EU Directive E112 (2003) requires mobile phone networks to provide emergency services with whatever information they have about the location a mobile call was made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_SA/TSG_SA/TSGS_21/Docs/PDF/SP-030372.pdf|title=European Commission Technical Specification TSGS#21(03)0372|accessdate=2009-01-03}}</ref> This directive is based on the American [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s Enhanced 911 ruling in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/pshs/services/911-services/enhanced911/Welcome.html|title=Enhanced 911 (FCC website)|accessdate=2009-01-03}}</ref>

==System changes==
[[File:SPRINTER-BYDGOSZCZ.jpg|thumb|250 px|Ambulance type '''(P)''' in Bydgoszcz's street - unit P1]]

===Current staffing===
In Poland, there were two types of emergency ambulances, type R (now S), and type W (P),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Guła P, Hładki W, Górski K, Popławska M |title=[Simplified schema of action of the ambulance rescue services during mass casualty] |language=Polish |journal=Prz. Lek. |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |year=2008 |pmid=18669100 |doi= |url=}}</ref> which are staffed as follows:
*Ambulance type S (specialized) - 3 people including a physician, paramedic-nurse, and a driver-paramedic.
*Ambulance type P - 3  including a physician 1 paramedic-nurse, and a driver-paramedic. Or 2 people Nurses/paramedics and driver-paramedic.

===Planned reforms===
The government of Poland has mandated significant changes within the EMS system.  These will include more paramedic-led ambulances and less physician-led ambulances.  In the proposed system Polish paramedics will perform ALS skills without a physician present.  These changes are proposed to occur in 2010, with the acquisition of some 600 new ambulances by the Polish government; the result of industrial action by Polish paramedics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2008/07/articles/pl0807049i.htm|title=Medical rescue workers stage protest for better conditions and pay|accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref> Patient transport ambulances (Type T) and [[newborn transport|neonatal transport]] ambulances (Type N) will remain in their current configurations.  The new types of ambulances and staffing patterns will be as follows:

*The ''ambulans specialistyczny'' '''(S)''' (English: specialist ambulance) will be a larger van used for serious emergencies. This will be used only for potentially life-threatening responses. Standard personnel staffing will consist of a doctor (with emergency medicine specialization), A paramedic/nurse, and a driver/orderly.  The vehicle used will be in all cases a CEN 1789 Class C ambulance. The new ambulance category, Type S will replace the Type R ambulance in the "More ALS" category.
*The ''ambulans podstawowy''  '''(P)''' (English: basic ambulance) will be a standard van-type ambulance used  for emergency  responses when a Type S unit is unavailable, and for lower priority emergency calls.  Such vehicles will not be used for consultations, or for non-emergency transport.  Standard staffing of personnel will consist of a paramedics-Nurses and a driver-orderly. The new category, Type P will replace the old  Type W vehicle configuration. Type P ambulances will conform to, at minimum, CEN 1789 Class B, with the option at a local level to use Class C vehicles instead.
