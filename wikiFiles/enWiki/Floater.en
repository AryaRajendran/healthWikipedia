'''Floaters''' are deposits of various size, shape, consistency, [[refractive index]], and [[motility]] within the [[Human eye|eye]]’s [[vitreous humour]], which is normally transparent.<ref name="Cline">Cline D; Hofstetter HW; Griffin JR.

The common type of floater, which is present in most people’s eyes, is due to degenerative changes of the vitreous humour. The [[visual perception|perception]] of floaters is known as ''myodesopsia'',<ref>From Greek [http://www.zeno.org/Pape-1880/A/μυιώδης μυιώδης] "fly-like" ([[Myiodes]] was also the name of a fly-deterring deity) and ὄψις "sight."</ref> or less commonly as ''myodaeopsia'', ''myiodeopsia'', ''myiodesopsia''.<ref name="Cline"/> They are also called ''Muscae volitantes'' (Latin: "flying flies"), or ''mouches volantes'' (from the French). Floaters are visible because of the shadows they cast on the [[retina]]<ref name=pamphlet>American Academy of Ophthalmology. "Floaters and Flashes: A Closer Look" (pamphlet) San Francisco: AAO, 2006.  ISBN 1-56055-371-5</ref> or refraction of the light that passes through them, and can appear alone or together with several others in one’s [[visual field]]. They may appear as spots, threads, or fragments of cobwebs, which float slowly before the observer’s eyes.<ref name=facts/> Since these objects exist within the eye itself, they are not [[optical illusions]] but are [[entoptic phenomenon|entoptic phenomena]]. 

==Description==
Floaters are suspended in the [[vitreous humour]], the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye.<ref name=spots>{{cite web
  | title = Eye floaters and spots; Floaters or spots in the eye
  | publisher = National Eye Institute
  | url = http://www.eyecaresource.com/conditions/eye-floaters/
  | accessdate = February 2008}}</ref> Thus, they follow the rapid motions of the eye, while drifting slowly within the fluid. When they are first noticed, the natural reaction is to attempt to look directly at them. However, attempting to shift one's gaze toward them can be difficult since floaters follow the motion of the eye, remaining to the side of the direction of gaze. Floaters are, in fact, visible only because they do not remain perfectly fixed within the eye. Although the blood vessels of the eye also obstruct light, they are invisible under normal circumstances because they are fixed in location relative to the [[retina]], and the brain "tunes out" [[stabilized images]] due to [[neural adaptation]].  This stabilization is often interrupted by floaters, especially  when they tend to remain visible.<ref name=facts/>

Floaters are particularly noticeable when looking at a blank surface or an open [[monochromatic]] space, such as blue sky. Despite the name "floaters", many of these specks have a tendency to sink toward the bottom of the eyeball, in whichever way the eyeball is oriented; the supine position (looking up or lying back) tends to concentrate them near the fovea, which is the center of gaze, while the textureless and evenly lit sky forms an ideal background against which to view them.<ref name=spots/> The brightness of the daytime sky also causes the eyes' pupils to contract, reducing the [[aperture]], which makes floaters less blurry and easier to see.

Floaters are essentially changeless, and the most prominent continue to be seen in the field of vision for a lifetime.<ref>http://www.formulamedical.com/Topics/Head&Neck/Eye%20floaters%20vitreous.htm Floaters may remain indefinitely</ref> They are not uncommon, and do not cause serious problems for most people; they represent one of the most common presentations to hospital eye services. A survey of optometrists in 2002 suggested that an average of 14 patients per month per optometrist presented with symptoms of floaters in the UK.<ref>{{Cite document

The shapes are shadows projected onto the [[retina]] by tiny structures of [[protein]] or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the vitreous humour. Floaters can even be seen when the eyes are closed on especially bright days, when sufficient light penetrates the eyelids to cast the shadows. It is not, however, only elderly people who are troubled by floaters; they can also become a problem to younger people, especially if they are [[myopia|myopic]]. They are also common after [[cataract]] operations or after trauma. In some cases, floaters are [[congenital]].<ref name=pre>{{cite web

Floaters are able to catch and refract light in ways that somewhat blur vision temporarily until the floater moves to a different area. Often they trick people who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see something out of the corner of their eye that really is not there. Most people come to terms with the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For people with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.
[[File:Premacular Bursa.svg|thumb|Premacular Bursa]]

Floaters have been reported in patients as young as 3.{{fact|date=February 2012}} Floaters in teenage patients and young adults are usually harder to treat. For people in this age group, the floater that is seen usually looks like a kind of crystal (translucent) worm/web/cell. These particular floaters aren't really floaters in a technical sense as they aren't found in the vitreous humour, instead they are found right on top of the retina in the [[premacular bursa]]. Very little is known about this region, and it only becomes distinct after the [[Posterior vitreous detachment|vitreous detaches from the retina]] at later stages of life. Due to their microscopic size they cannot be seen by professional doctors. They only appear as big as they do because of their proximity to the retina. This type of floater is still described occasionally in the third decade and very rarely occur in the 40 or older population.<ref>{{cite web

==Causes==
There are various causes for the appearance of floaters, of which the most common are described here. Simply stated, any damage to the eye that causes material to enter the vitreous humour can result in floaters.

Floaters can be a sign of [[retinal detachment]] or a [[retinal tear]] but in most cases (98% according to the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]]{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}) it is simply age related or due to natural change in the [[vitreous humour]].

===Vitreous syneresis===
The most common cause of floaters is shrinkage of the vitreous humour: this gel-like substance consists of 99% water and 1% solid elements. The solid portion consists of a network of [[collagen]] and [[hyaluronic acid]], with the latter retaining water molecules. [[Depolymerization]] of this network makes the hyaluronic acid release its trapped water, thereby liquefying the gel. The collagen breaks down into [[fibril]]s, which ultimately are the floaters that plague the patient. Floaters caused in this way tend to be few in number and of a linear form.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Posterior vitreous detachments and retinal detachments===
[[Image:Vitreous Floaters.jpg|right|thumb|Weiss ring floater: a large, ring shaped floater that is sometimes seen if the vitreous releases from the back of the eye]]
In time, the liquefied vitreous body loses support and its framework contracts. This leads to [[posterior vitreous detachment]], in which the [[vitreous membrane]] is released from the sensory retina. During this detachment, the shrinking vitreous can [[phosphene|stimulate the retina mechanically]], causing the patient to see random flashes across the visual field, sometimes referred to as "flashers", a symptom more formally referred to as [[photopsia]]. The ultimate release of the vitreous around the optic nerve head sometimes makes a large floater appear, usually in the shape of a ring ("Weiss ring").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agingeye.net/visionbasics/flashesandfloaters.php |title=Flashes & Floaters |accessdate=2008-02-24 |publisher=The Eye Digest }}</ref> As a complication, part of the retina might be torn off by the departing vitreous membrane, in a process known as [[retinal detachment]]. This will often leak blood into the vitreous, which is seen by the patient as a sudden appearance of numerous small dots, moving across the whole field of vision. Retinal detachment requires immediate medical attention, as it can easily cause [[blindness]]. Consequently, both the appearance of flashes and the sudden onset of numerous small floaters should be rapidly investigated by an eye care provider.<ref name=det>{{cite web  | title = Flashes and Floaters (Posterior Vitreous Detachment)  | publisher =St. Luke's Cataract & Laser Institute  | url =http://www.stlukeseye.com/Conditions/floaters.html| accessdate =February 2008}}</ref>

===Regression of the hyaloid artery===
The [[hyaloid artery]], an artery running through the vitreous humour during the [[fetus|fetal]] stage of development, regresses in the third trimester of [[pregnancy]].  Its disintegration can sometimes leave cell matter.<ref>[http://www.healthhaven.com/hyaloid_artery.htm Floaters in fetal development] {{Dead link|date=September 2009|url=http://www.healthhaven.com/hyaloid_artery.htm}}</ref>

===Drug adverse effects===
According to the UK '[[Yellow Card Scheme]]' that allows people to report adverse effects of prescription drugs other than those stated, there is one possible case of [[Ocular Zovirax]] causing floaters.{{Citation needed|reason=sentence is referring to a specific report, but there is no reference to that report.|date=December 2012}}

===Other common causes===
Patients with [[retinal tear]]s may experience floaters if [[red blood cell]]s are released from leaky blood vessels, and those with a posterior uveitis or vitritis, as in [[toxoplasmosis]], may experience multiple floaters and decreased vision due to the accumulation of [[white blood cell]]s in the vitreous humour.<ref>{{Cite web

Other causes for floaters include [[cystoid macular edema]] and [[asteroid hyalosis]]. The latter is an anomaly of the vitreous humour, whereby [[calcium]] clumps attach themselves to the collagen network. The bodies that are formed in this way move slightly with eye movement, but then return to their fixed position.

===Tear film debris===
Sometimes the appearance of floaters has to be attributed to dark specks in the [[tears|tear film]] of the eye. Technically, these are not floaters, but they do look the same from the viewpoint of the patient. People with [[blepharitis]] or a dysfunctional [[meibomian gland]] are especially prone to this cause, but [[allergic conjunctivitis|ocular allergies]] can also cause the problem.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} To differentiate between material in the vitreous humour of the eye and debris in the tear film, one can look at the effect of blinking: debris in the tear film will move quickly with a blink, while floaters are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true floaters and [[macular degeneration]].

==Diagnosis==
Floaters are often readily observed by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist with the use of an [[ophthalmoscope]] or [[slit lamp]]. However, if the floater is near the retina, it may not be visible to the observer even if it appears large to the sufferer.

Increasing background illumination or using a pinhole to effectively decrease pupil diameter may allow a person to obtain a better view of his or her own floaters. The head may be tilted in such a way that one of the floaters drifts towards the central axis of the eye. In the sharpened image the fibrous elements are more conspicuous.<ref name=med>{{cite web

The presence of retinal tears with new onset of floaters was surprisingly high (14%; 95% confidence interval, 12%-16%) as reported in a metaanalysis published as part of the Rational Clinical Examination Series in the Journal of the American Medical Association.<ref>Hollands H, Johnson D, Brox AC, Almeida D, Simel DL, Sharma S. Acute-onset floaters and flashes: is this patient at risk for retinal detachment? JAMA. 2009 November 25;302(20):2243-9.</ref>  Patients with new onset flashes and/or floaters, especially when associated with visual loss or restriction in the visual field, should seek more urgent ophthalmologic evaluation.

== Treatment ==
* [[Vitrectomy]] may be successful in treating more severe cases;<ref>Roth M, Trittibach P, Koerner F, Sarra G. "[Pars plana vitrectomy for idiopathic vitreous floaters.]" ''Klin Monatsbl Augenheilkd.'' 2005 Sep;222(9):728-32. PMID 16175483.</ref><ref name=Vitro>{{cite web
  | title = Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) & floater only vitrectomy
  | url = http://www.eye-floaters.com/treatingfloaters-vitrectomy.php{{Dead link|date=June 2011}}
  | accessdate = February 2008}}</ref> The technique usually involves making three openings through the part of the [[sclera]] known as the [[pars plana]]. Of these small gauge instruments, one is an infusion port to resupply a saline solution and maintain the pressure of the eye, the second is a fiber optic light source, and the third is a vitrector. The vitrector has a reciprocating cutting tip attached to a suction device. This design reduces traction on the retina via the vitreous material. A variant sutureless, self-sealing technique is sometimes used.

For most cases, vitrectomies for floaters are successful but complications do occur. Complications include cataracts, retinal detachment, macular edema, hypotony, residual floaters, anterior vitreous detachment and optic nerve damage.

It is an outpatient process, which is much less invasive to the eye than a vitrectomy, with potentially fewer side effects. As of July 2010, laser treatment is not widely practiced and is performed by very few specialists. One of them, [[John Karickhoff]], has performed the procedure more than 1,400 times and claims a 90 percent success rate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/health/main2413321.shtml |title=Surgery To Rid Eye "Floaters" Scrutinized|publisher=CBSNews HealthWatch|accessdate=December 5, 2011}}</ref> The [[MedicineNet]] web site states that "there is no evidence that this [laser treatment] is effective.

*"They could have done the same thing, alone, in the back yard, seeing the shapes swimming in the sky. I forget how old I was when I asked somebody about it, and I was told that those wonderful gliding changing spots were imperfections in the fluid of my eye-ball, that what I was seeing was in my eye. In ''your'' eye! For so long, for a child's years, the sky was full of wonder, these shapes were in the sky, the sky was full of transparent things that swooped and swam. They were almost invisible, and, I thought, almost bodiless, they were there, but you could go right through them, they were animals that lived in the air. You see, we didn't go around talking about things like this.
