'''Male [[lactation]]''' in zoology means production of milk from [[mammary gland]]s in the presence of physiological stimuli connected with nursing infants. It is well documented in the [[Dayak fruit bat]].

The term male [[lactation]] is not used in human medicine. It has been used in popular literature{{which|date=December 2010}} to describe the phenomenon of '''male [[galactorrhea]]''' which is a well documented condition in humans.

Newborn babies of both sexes can occasionally produce milk, this is called [[neonatal milk]] (also known as "witch's milk") and not considered male lactation. 

Male lactation was of some interest to [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who reports in ''Voyage aux régions équinoxiales du Nouveau Continent'' of a citizen of the village Arenas (close to [[Cumana]]) who allegedly nurtured his son for three months when his wife was ill,<ref>

Bonpland ; rédigé par Al. de Humboldt; J. Smith (Paris), 1814-1825, p. 376, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k61298j/f384.image.r=lozano (Online at gallica)]</ref> as well as [[Charles Darwin]], who commented on it in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (1871):
<blockquote>
''"It is well known that in the males of all mammals, including man, rudimentary mammae exist. These in several instances have become well developed, and have yielded a copious supply of milk. Their essential identity in the two sexes is likewise shown by their occasional sympathetic enlargement in both during an attack of the [[measles]]."''<ref>[[s:Descent of Man/Chapter I|Descent of Man, Chapter I]]</ref>  </blockquote>

Darwin later considered the nearly perfect function of male nipples in contrast to greatly reduced structures such as the [[vesicula prostatica]], speculating that both sexes may have nursed young in early mammalian ancestors, and subsequently mammals evolved to inactivate them in males at an early age.<ref>[[s:Descent of Man/Chapter VI|Descent of Man, Chapter VI]]</ref>

==Evolution and biology==
Male mammals of many species have been observed to lactate under unusual or pathogenic conditions such as extreme stress, feeding castrated animals with phytoestrogens or animals with pituitary tumors. Hence it was hypothesized that while most mammals could easily develop the ability to lactate this does not provide the males, or the species with any evolutionary advantage. While the males could in theory improve the chance to pass on their genes by improving the feeding their offspring by male lactation, most of them have developed other strategies such as mating with additional partners. Presently only very few species are known where male lactation occurs and it is not well understood what evolutionary factors control the development of this trait.<ref name=Kunz_2009>{{cite pmid|19100649}}</ref>

==Nonhuman animal male lactation==
The phenomenon of male lactation occurs in some other [[species]], notably the [[Dayak fruit bat]] (''[[Dyacopterus spadiceus]]''), and the lactating males may assist in the [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] of their [[infant]]s. In addition, male [[goats]] are known to lactate on occasion.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gómez MA, Garcés-Abadías B, Muñoz A, Vásquez F, Serrano J, Bernabé A | title = Structural and Ultrastructural Study of GH, PRL and SMT Cells in Male Goat by Immunocytochemical Methods | journal = Cells Tissues Organs | year = 1999 | volume = 165 | pages = 22–29 | doi = 10.1159/000016670 | pmid = 10460970 | issue = 1}}</ref> In rare cases male cats have been known to lactate in response to stimulation by a kitten, especially if the male has been neutered. <ref>{{cite web||title='Kitten Nurses on Male Cat - AllExperts.com|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Cats-1606/2009/3/kitten-nurses-male-cat.htm|accessdate=February 26th, 2012}}</ref>

==Human male lactation==
The phenomenon of successful human male breastfeeding has been credibly observed in several cases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nikhil Swaminathan | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-males-can-lactate&sc=rss | title = Strange but True: Males Can Lactate | journal = [[Scientific American]] | date = 2007-09-06 | accessdate = 2008-05-27}}</ref> However, the cases are not sufficiently documented to allow distinguishing of possible pathologic galactorrhea.
