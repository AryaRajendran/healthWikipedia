In [[medicine]], '''colitis''' ([[plural|pl.]] colitides) refers to an [[inflammation]] of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] and is often used to describe an inflammation of the [[large intestine]] (colon, [[caecum]] and [[rectum]]).  

Colitides may be [[acute (medicine)|acute]] and self-limited or [[chronic (medical)|chronic]], i.e. persistent, and broadly fits into the category of [[digestive diseases|digestive disease]]s.

In a medical context, the label ''colitis'' (without qualification) is used if:
* The [[etiology (medicine)|aetiology]] of the inflammation in the colon is undetermined; for example, ''colitis'' may be applied to ''[[Crohn's disease]]'' at a time when the [[diagnosis]] has not declared itself, or
* The context is clear; for example, an individual with [[ulcerative colitis]] is talking about their disease with a physician that knows the [[diagnosis]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The [[sign (medicine)|signs]] and [[symptom]]s of colitides are quite variable and dependent on the etiology (or cause) of the given colitis and factors that modify its course and severity.  

Symptoms of colitis may include: [[abdominal pain]], loss of appetite, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], diarrhea, cramping, urgency and [[bloating]].

Signs may include: abdominal tenderness, weight loss, changes in bowel habits (increased frequency), [[fever]], bleeding (overt or [[Fecal occult blood|occult]])/bloody stools, diarrhea and distension.

Signs seen on colonoscopy include: colonic mucosal [[erythema]] (redness of the inner surface of the colon), ulcers, [[bleeding]].

==Diagnosis==
Symptoms suggestive of colitis are worked-up by obtaining the [[medical history]], a physical examination and laboratory tests ([[complete blood count|CBC]], [[serum electrolytes|electrolyte]]s, stool culture and sensitivity, stool ova and parasites et cetera).  Additional tests may include medical imaging (e.g. abdominal [[computed tomography]], [[abdominal X-ray]]s) and an examination with a camera inserted into the rectum ([[sigmoidoscopy]], [[colonoscopy]]).

==Types==
There are many types of colitis.  They are usually classified by the etiology.

Types of colitis include:

===Autoimmune===
*Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) - a group of chronic colitides. {{main|Inflammatory bowel disease}}
**Ulcerative colitis - a chronic colitis that affects the large intestine. {{main|Ulcerative colitis}}
**Crohn's disease - a type of IBD often leads to a colitis. {{main|Crohn's disease}}

===Idiopathic===
*Microscopic colitis - a colitis is diagnosed by microscopic examination of colonic tissue; macroscopically it is normal appearing. {{main|Microscopic colitis}}
**Lymphocytic colitis.{{main|Lymphocytic colitis}}

A well-known subtype of infectious colitis is [[Clostridium difficile colitis]],<ref>{{cite web

Entero[[hemorrhagic]] colitis may be caused by [[Shiga toxin]] in ''[[Shigella dysenteriae]]'' or ''Shigatoxigenic group'' of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (STEC), which includes [[serotype]] [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|O157:H7]] and other enterohemorrhagic ''E. coli''.<ref name=Beutin_2006>{{cite journal |author=Beutin L |title=Emerging enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, causes and effects of the rise of a human pathogen |journal=J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=299–305 |year=2006 |pmid=16930272 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0450.2006.00968.x}}</ref>

[[Parasitic]] infections, like those caused by ''Entamoeba histolytica'', can also cause colitis.

''Atypical colitis'' is a phrase that is occasionally used by physicians for a colitis that does not conform to criteria for accepted types of colitis.  It is not an accepted diagnosis ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' and, as such, a colitis that cannot be definitively classified.

===Severity of colitides===

'''Fulminant colitis''' is any colitis that becomes worse rapidly.  In addition to the [[diarrhea]], [[fever]], and [[anemia]] seen in colitis, the patient has severe abdominal pain and presents a clinical picture similar to that of [[septicemia]], where [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] is present.  About half of human patients require surgery.  In horses, the fulminant colitis known as [[colitis X]] usually results in death within 24 hours.

[[Irritable bowel syndrome]], a separate disease, has been called spastic colitis. This name may lead to confusion, since colitis is not always a feature of irritable bowel syndrome. Since the etiology of IBS is currently unknown and possibly multifactorial, there may be some overlap in symptoms between IBS and the various forms of colitis.

==Treatment==
{{medref|section|date=February 2013}}
How a given colitis is treated is dependent on its [[etiology]].  Infectious colitis are usually treated with antimicrobial agents (e.g. antibiotics) such as [[nifuroxazide]].{{medcn|date=February 2013}}  Autoimmune mediated colitis is treated with immune modulators/immune suppressants.{{medcn|date=February 2013}} Severe colitis can be life-threatening and may require surgery.{{medcn|date=February 2013}}

Ulcerative colitis can often be treated with changes to one's diet.{{medcn|date=February 2013}} Although the causes of colitis are not known, the disease can become manifested due to faulty diet.  When symptoms such as flatulence, cramping, mucous and bloody discharges and blood on stools begin to occur, the B.R.A.T. diet is recommended.{{medcn|date=February 2013}} This acronym is derived from bananas, rice, apple sauce and toast. Foods to avoid are dairy products and fried foods.
