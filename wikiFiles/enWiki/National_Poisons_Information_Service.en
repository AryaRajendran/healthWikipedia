The '''National Poisons Information Service''' is an information service provided by the [[Health Protection Agency]] for the NHS. Poisoning accounts for 1% of NHS admissions. [[Pesticide]]s used in agriculture ([[glyphosate]] and [[organophosphorus]] insecticides) are extremely toxic, but 87% of around 120,000 annual poisoning cases in the UK take place in the home.

==History==
In August 1962 the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]] announced it was forming a poisons information service. This was after the ''Emergency Treatment in Hospital of Cases of Acute Poisoning'' published by the [[Central Health Services Council]] in March 1962. Many more household chemicals were on the market, and the chemical composition was only known to the manufacturers. 4,000 to 5,000 people each year were lethally poisoned, with 6,085 in 1962; however, many of the deaths were (non-accidental) suicides. 

It started in 1963 by Dr [[Roy Goulding]]<ref>[http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/5751 Roy Goulding]</ref> at the Medical Toxicology Unit of [[Guy's Hospital]], with a staff of 65. By the late 1960s, [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] were presenting a widespread danger. Other centres were soon set up in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff.

UKTIS was based in Newcastle from 1995.

==Structure==
It has four units in Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Newcastle. It is a member of the [[European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists]].

* NPIS Birmingham Unit (West Midlands Poisons Unit), [[City Hospital, Birmingham]] - Professor [[Allister Vale]]
* NPIS Cardiff Unit, [[Cardiff and Vale University Health Board|Llandough Hospital]] - Dr John Thompson
* NPIS Edinburgh Unit (Scottish Poisons Information Bureau,<ref>[http://www.spib.scot.nhs.uk Scottish Poisons Information Bureau]</ref> [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] - Professor Nicholas Bateman
* NPIS Newcastle Unit, Regional Drug and Therapeutics Centre,<ref>[http://www.nyrdtc.nhs.uk Regional Drug and Therapeutics Centre]</ref> [[Newcastle University]] - Professor Simon Thomas

NPIS Birmingham has the NPIS Product Data Centre, provided by manufacturer's information, and deals with around 2,300 companies.

It supports (24 hours) NHS Direct (for England and Wales) and (24 hours) [[NHS 24]] for Scotland. Northern Ireland has its Northern Ireland Regional Medicines and Poisons Information Service in Belfast, and NPIS is used when this is not available. The Republic of Ireland uses the service, via the TOXBASE database, which is used by the country's National Poisons Information Centre.<ref>[http://www.poisons.ie Poisons Information Centre - Ireland]</ref>

Of all UK nations, Wales has the highest proportionate number of enquiries to the service, with Northern Ireland the fewest. Within England, there is a distribution of higher number of enquiries to the service in the north than the south, with [[NHS North East]] having the highest and [[NHS South of England]] having the least proportionate number of enquiries. The vast majority (95%) of enquiries come from A&E departments. Around 65% of poisoning is from pharmaceuticals ([[paracetamol]], [[ibuprofen]], [[citalopram]], [[diazepam]] and [[zopiclone]]) and 15% from household chemicals ([[detergent]]s, [[bleach]], and [[Isopropyl alcohol|isopropanol]]).<ref>[http://www.npis.org/NPISAnnualReport2010-11.pdf Annual report]</ref> There are very dangerous chemicals stored in most UK kitchens.

Wednesday is the busiest day of the week for enquiries, with the fewest at the weekend.

==Function==
It runs the TOXBASE national database, which began in 1982, and was available worldwide from 1999. 1.4 million accesses are made to the database each year by around 500,000 users. Most of the accesses are made by A&E staff. Around 14,000 substances are on TOXBASE.

The information service the NPIS provides is similar to [[NHS Direct]]; NHS Direct use the TOXBASE database. The book also most commonly used for a similar purpose in the UK is the [[British National Formulary]].
