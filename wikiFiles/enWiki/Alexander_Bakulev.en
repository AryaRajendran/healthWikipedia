'''Aleksandr Nikolayevich Bakulev''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Никола́евич Ба́кулев}}) ({{OldStyleDate|December 7|1890|November 25}} - March 31, 1967) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] surgeon, one of the founders of cardiovascular surgery in the [[USSR]]. 

Born in Nevenikovskaya (now in the [[Kirov oblast]]) into a peasant family which belonged to the old Vyatka clan of Bakulevs, Bakulev attended the medical faculty of [[Saratov University]] after graduating from high school. During the [[First World War]] he served as a regimental medical officer on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1938 Bakulev conducted a successful [[lobectomy]] in a case of chronic lung [[abscess]]. In 1939 he earned the academic degree of [[Professor]] and the same year conducted a successful lobectomy in a case of pulmonary [[actinomycosis]]. In 1943 Bakulev became head of the surgery department of the 2nd [[Nikolay Ivanovich Pirogov|Pirogov]] Moscow Institute of Medicine. On the [[Eastern Front of World War II]], Bakulev was the chief surgeon of Moscow evacuation hospitals. In 1948 he pioneered the surgical treatment of [[congenital heart disorder]]s in the Soviet Union. He was the President of the USSR Academy of Sciences from 1953 to 1960.
