The '''urinary system''' or '''renal system'''  is the [[organ system]] that produces, stores, and eliminates [[urine]]. In humans it includes two [[kidney]]s, two [[ureter]]s, the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] and the [[urethra]]. The female and male urinary system are very similar, differing only in the length of the urethra.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/1122.htm |title=Female urinary tract |work=MedLine Plus Medical Encyclopedia |date=16 September 2011 |first=David |last=C. Dugdale}}</ref>

Urine is formed in the kidneys through a filtration of [[blood]]. The urine is then passed through the ureters to the bladder, where it is stored. During [[urination]] (peeing) the urine is passed from the bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body.

About 1-2 litres of urine are produced every day in a healthy human, although this amount may vary according to circumstances such as fluid intake.


==Function==
There are several functions of the Urinary System:

* Removal of waste product from the body (mainly [[urea]] and [[uric acid]])
* Regulation of [[electrolyte]] balance (e.g. [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and [[calcium]])
* Regulation [[acid-base homeostasis]]
* Controlling [[blood volume]] and maintaining [[blood pressure]]

==Urine formation==
Average urine production in adult humans is about 1 – 2 L per day, depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health. Producing too much or too little urine needs medical attention. [[Polyuria]] is a condition of excessive production of urine (> 2.5 L/day), [[oliguria]] when < 400 mL are produced, and [[anuria]] one of < 100 mL per day.

The first step in urine formation is the filtration of blood in the kidneys. In an healthy human the kidney receives between 12 and 30 % of [[cardiac output]], but it averages about 20 % or about 1.25 L/min.

The basic structural and functional unit of the kidney is the [[nephron]]. Its chief function is to regulate the [[concentration]] of [[water]] and soluble substances like [[sodium salt]]s by filtering the [[blood]], reabsorbing what is needed and excreting the rest as [[urine]].

In the first part of the nephron, the [[renal corpuscle]] blood is being filtrated from the [[circulatory system]] into the nephron. A pressure difference between forces the filtrate from the blood across the filtration membrane. The filtrate includes water, small molecules and ions that easily pass through the filtration membrane. However larger molecules such as [[proteins]] and [[blood cell]]s is prevented from passing through the filtration membrane. The amount of filtrate produced every minute is called the [[glomerular filtration rate]] or GFR and amounts to a staggering 180 litres per day. About 99 % of this filtrate is then reabsorbed as it passes through the nephron and the remaining 1 % becomes urine.

The urinary system is regulated by the [[endocrine system]] by [[hormone]]s such as [[antidiuretic hormone]], [[aldosterone]], and [[parathyroid hormone]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Maton | first = Anthea | authorlink = | coauthors = Jean Hopkins, Charles William McLaughlin, Susan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill D.

===Regulation of concentration and volume===
The urinary system is under influence of the blood pressure, [[nervous system]] and [[endocrine system]]. 

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is a [[neurohypophysial hormone]] found in most [[mammals]]. Its two primary functions are to retain water in the body and to constrict blood vessels. Vasopressin regulates the body's [[Water retention (medicine)|retention of water]] by acting to increase water absorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney nephron.<ref name="isbn0-387-30348-0">{{cite book | author =  Caldwell HK, Young WS III | authorlink = | editor = Lajtha A, Lim R | others = | title = Handbook of Neurochemistry and Molecular Neurobiology: Neuroactive Proteins and Peptides | edition = 3rd | language = | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2006 | origyear = | chapter =  Oxytocin and Vasopressin: Genetics and Behavioral Implications | chapterurl= http://refworks.springer.com/mrw/fileadmin/pdf/Neurochemistry/0387303480C25.PDF | pages = 573–607| quote = | isbn = 0-387-30348-0 | oclc = | doi = | url =  | accessdate = }}</ref> Vasopressin increases water permeability of the kidney's collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule by inducing translocation of aquaporin-CD water channels in the kidney nephron collecting duct plasma membrane.<ref name="pmid7532304">{{cite journal | author = Nielsen S, Chou CL, Marples D, Christensen EI, Kishore BK, Knepper MA | title = Vasopressin increases water permeability of kidney collecting duct by inducing translocation of aquaporin-CD water channels to plasma membrane | journal = Proc.

==Urine movement==
Urine moves from the nephrones [[collecting duct system]] to the [[minor calyx]] and then the [[major calyx]] before entering the [[renal pelvis]], a funnel-like dilated proximal part of the [[ureter]] within the kidney. The major function of the renal pelvis is to act as a funnel for urine flowing to the ureter. From here the urine flows through the ureters to the bladder, where it is stored until [[urination]] takes place.

==Urination==
Urination is the ejection of [[urine]] from the [[urinary bladder]] through the [[urethra]] to the outside of the body. In healthy humans (and [[#Animals|many other animals]]), the process of urination is under voluntary control. In infants, some elderly individuals, and those with neurological injury, urination may occur as an involuntary [[reflex]]. In other animals, in addition to expelling waste material, urination [[#Other animals|can mark territory or express submissiveness]]. Physiologically, micturition involves coordination between the [[central nervous system|central]], [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]], and [[somatic nervous system]]s. Brain centers that regulate urination include the [[pontine micturition center]], [[periaqueductal gray]], and the [[cerebral cortex]]. In male [[placental mammals]], urine is ejected through the [[penis]], and in female placental mammals through the [[vulva]].

==Urologic disease==
[[Urologic disease]] can involve congenital or acquired dysfunction of the urinary system.

Kidney diseases are normally investigated and treated by [[nephrologist]]s, while the specialty of [[urology]] deals with problems in the other organs. [[Gynecology|Gynecologists]] may deal with problems of incontinence in women.

Diseases of other bodily systems also have a direct effect on urogenital function.  For instance it has been shown that [[protein]] released by the kidneys in [[diabetes mellitus]] sensitises the kidney to the damaging effects of [[hypertension]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baba | first1 = T | last2 = Murabayashi | first2 = S | last3 = Tomiyama | first3 = T | last4 = Takebe | first4 = K | title = Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with a rapid progression of nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria and preserved renal function | journal = The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine | volume = 161 | issue = 4 | pages = 311–8 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2256104 | doi = 10.1620/tjem.161.311 }}</ref>

[[Diabetes]] also can have a direct effect in [[urination]] due to [[peripheral neuropathy|peripheral neuropathies]] which occur in some individuals with poorly controlled diabetes.
