== Biochemistry ==

Tetrodotoxin binds to what is known as ''site 1'' of the fast [[voltage-gated sodium channel]].  Site 1 is located at the extracellular pore opening of the ion channel.  The binding of any molecules to this site will temporarily disable the function of the ion channel.  [[Saxitoxin]], [[neosaxitoxin]] and several of the [[conotoxin]]s also bind the same site.

The use of this toxin as a biochemical probe has elucidated two distinct types of voltage-gated sodium channels present in humans: the tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel (TTX-s Na<sup>+</sup> channel) and the tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channel (TTX-r Na<sup>+</sup> channel).  Tetrodotoxin binds to TTX-s Na<sup>+</sup> channels with a binding affinity of 5-15 [[Concentration|nanomolar]], while the TTX-r Na<sup>+</sup> channels bind TTX with low [[Concentration|micromolar]] affinity.  Nerve cells containing TTX-r Na<sup>+</sup> channels are located primarily in [[cardiac]] tissue, while nerve cells containing TTX-s Na<sup>+</sup> channels dominate the rest of the body. The prevalence of TTX-s Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the [[central nervous system]] makes tetrodotoxin a valuable agent for the silencing of [[neurons|neural activity]] within a [[cell culture]].

The toxin blocks the fast Na<sup>+</sup> current in human [[myocytes]] (the contractile cells of the muscles), thereby inhibiting their contraction. By contrast, the sodium channels in pacemaker cells of the heart are of the slow variety, so action potentials in the cardiac nodes are not inhibited by the compound. Note, the SA and AV nodes do not contain Na<sup>+</sup> channels only Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, only the [[Purkinje fibers]] contain Na+ channels. The [[myocytes]] in the [[atrium (heart)|atrium]], which surround the main cardiac pacemaker, do express this fast Na<sup>+</sup> current and therefore the electrical activity is blocked and the heart fails to beat.

Blocking of fast Na<sup>+</sup> channels has potential medical use in treating some cardiac arrhythmias. Tetrodotoxin has proved useful in the treatment of pain (originally used in Japan in the 1930s) from such diverse problems as terminal cancer,<ref name="Hagen_2008">{{cite journal | author = Hagen NA, du Souich P, Lapointe B, Ong-Lam M, Dubuc B, Walde D, Love R, Ngoc AH; on behalf of the Canadian Tetrodotoxin Study Group | title = Tetrodotoxin for Moderate to Severe Cancer Pain: A Randomized, Double Blind, Parallel Design Multicenter Study | journal = J Pain Symptom Manage | volume = 35| issue = 4| pages = 420–9| year = 2008 | pmid = 18243639 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.05.011  }}</ref> migraines, and heroin withdrawal.<ref name="isbn0-7890-0553-0">{{cite book | author = Stimmel, Barry | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Alcoholism, drug addiction, and the road to recovery: life on the edge | edition = | language = | publisher = Haworth Medical Press | location = New York | year = 2002 | origyear = | pages = | chapter=12: Heroin Addiction | quote = "Tetrodotoxin blocks the sodium currents and is believed to have potential as a potent analgesic and as an effective agent in detoxoification from heroin addiction without withdrawal symptoms and without producing physical dependence" | isbn = 0-7890-0553-0 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

== Poisoning ==

TTX is extremely toxic. The toxin can enter the body by ingestion, injection, inhalation and through abraded skin.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Patocka J|coauthors=Stredav L|title=BRIEF REVIEW OF NATURAL NONPROTEIN NEUROTOXINS|journal=ASA Newsletter|date=April 23, 2002|volume=02-2|issue=89|pages=16–23|url=http://www.asanltr.com/newsletter/02-2/articles/Neurotoxins.htm|accessdate=26 May 2012|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Price|at=Newsletter archives|publisher=Applied Science and Analysis inc.|issn=1057-9419}}</ref> The mechanism of toxicity is through the blockage of fast voltage-gated sodium channels. These are required for the normal transmission of signals between the body and brain, as a result, TTX causes paralysis of voluntary muscles (including the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, stopping breathing), the loss of vagal regulation of heart rate (causing it to increase to around 100bpm), and loss of sensation. 

TTX is roughly 100 times more poisonous than [[potassium cyanide]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/27/blowfish-testicles-poison-diners |title=Blowfish testicles poison seven in Japanese restaurant |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 January 2009}}</ref> Fish poisoning by consumption of members of the order [[Tetraodontiformes]] is extremely serious.

It is not always fatal; but at near-lethal doses, it can leave a person in a state of near-death for several days, while the person remains conscious.  For this reason, TTX has been alleged an ingredient in [[Haitian Vodou]] and the closest approximation of [[zombie]]ism, an idea popularized by [[Harvard]]-trained [[ethnobotanist]] [[Wade Davis]] in a 1983 paper, and in his 1985 book, ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]''. This idea was dismissed by the scientific community in the 1980s, as the descriptions of voodoo zombies do not match the symptoms displayed by victims of tetrodotoxin poisoning, and the alleged incidents of zombies created in this manner could not be substantiated.<ref name="Hines">Hines, Terence; "Zombies and Tetrodotoxin"; ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''; May/June 2008; Volume 32, Issue 3; pp. 60–62.</ref>

=== Toxicity ===

The [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] for TTX lists the oral [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>) for mice as 334&nbsp;μg per kg.<ref>Material Safety Data Sheet Tetrodotoxin ACC# 01139 https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/01139.htm</ref> Assuming the lethal dose for humans is similar, 25 milligrams (0.000881&nbsp;oz) of tetrodotoxin would be expected to kill a {{convert|75|kg|lb|abbr=on|adj=on}} person. The amount needed to reach a lethal dose by injection is much smaller, 8 μg per kg,<ref>Material Safety Data Sheet Tetrodotoxin. Sigma-Aldrich Version 1.6 updated 10 March 2007.</ref> or a little over one-half milligram (0.00002&nbsp;oz) to kill a {{convert|75|kg|lb|abbr=on|adj=on}} person.

=== History ===

The first recorded cases of TTX poisoning were from the logs of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[James Cook]] from 7 September 1774,<ref name=uhm/> on which date Cook recorded his crew eating some local tropic fish (pufferfish), then feeding the remains to the pigs kept on board.  The crew experienced numbness and shortness of breath, while the pigs were all found dead the next morning.  In hindsight, it is clear that the crew received a mild dose of tetrodotoxin, while the pigs ate the pufferfish body parts that contain most of the toxin, thus being fatally poisoned.

The toxin was first isolated and named in 1909 by Japanese scientist Dr. [[Yoshizumi Tahara]].<ref name=uhm/>

=== Symptoms and treatment ===

The diagnosis of pufferfish poisoning is based on the observed symptomology and recent dietary history.

Symptoms typically develop within 30 minutes of ingestion, but may be delayed by up to four hours; however, death once occurred within 17 minutes of ingestion.<ref name=uhm/> [[Paresthesia]] of the lips and tongue is followed by [[hypersalivation]], sweating, headache, weakness, lethargy, [[ataxia|incoordination]], tremor, paralysis, [[cyanosis]], [[aphonia]], [[dysphagia]], seizures, [[dyspnea]], [[bronchorrhea]], [[bronchospasm]], respiratory failure, [[coma]], and [[hypotension]]. Gastroenteric symptoms are often severe and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Cardiac arrhythmias may precede complete respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse.

The first symptom of intoxication is a slight numbness of the lips and tongue, appearing between 20 minutes to three hours after eating poisonous pufferfish.<ref name=uhm/> The next symptom is increasing paresthesia in the face and extremities, which may be followed by sensations of lightness or floating. Headache, [[Epigastrium|epigastric]] pain, [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], and/or [[vomiting]] may occur. Occasionally, some reeling or difficulty in walking may occur. The second stage of the intoxication is increasing paralysis. Many victims are unable to move; even sitting may be difficult. There is increasing [[Shortness of breath|respiratory distress]]. Speech is affected, and the victim usually exhibits [[dyspnea]], [[cyanosis]], and [[hypotension]]. Paralysis increases and [[seizure|convulsions]], mental impairment, and [[cardiac arrhythmia]] may occur. The victim, although completely paralyzed, may be conscious and in some cases completely lucid until shortly before death. Death usually occurs within 4 to 6 hours, with a known range of about 20 minutes to 8 hours.

If the patient survives 24 hours, recovery without any residual effects will usually occur over several days.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/818763-overview Toxicity, Tetrodotoxin -Theodore I Benzer, MD, PhD]</ref>

Therapy is supportive and based on symptoms, with aggressive early airway management.<ref name=uhm/> If ingested, treatment can consist of emptying the stomach, feeding the victim [[activated charcoal]] to bind the toxin, and taking standard life-support measures to keep the victim alive until the effect of the poison has worn off.<ref name=uhm/>  Alpha adrenergic agonists are recommended in addition to intravenous fluids to combat hypotension. [[Anticholinesterase]] agents have been used with mixed success. No [[antidote]] has been developed and approved for human use; but a monoclonal antibody specific to tetrodotoxin has been developed by [[USAMRIID]] and was shown to be effective for reducing lethality in tests on mice.<ref>{{Cite journal

=== Geographic frequency of toxicity ===

Poisonings from tetrodotoxin have been almost exclusively associated with the consumption of pufferfish from waters of the Indo-Pacific ocean regions, but pufferfishes from other regions are much less commonly eaten. Several reported cases of poisonings, including fatalities, involved pufferfish from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Gulf of California]]. There have been no confirmed cases of tetrodotoxicity from the Atlantic pufferfish, ''[[Sphoeroides maculatus]]''; but in three studies, extracts from fish of this species were highly toxic in mice. Several recent intoxications from these fishes in Florida were due to [[saxitoxin]], which causes [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]] with very similar symptoms and signs. The trumpet shell ''[[Charonia sauliae]]'' has been implicated in food poisonings, and evidence suggests it contains a tetrodotoxin derivative. There have been several reported poisonings from mislabelled pufferfish, and at least one report of a fatal episode in Oregon when an individual swallowed a rough-skinned newt ''[[Taricha granulosa]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal

;Statistical factors

From 1974 through 1983, there were 646 reported cases of pufferfish poisoning in Japan, with 179 fatalities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Statistics from the Tokyo Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health indicate 20–44 incidents of [[fugu]] poisoning per year between 1996 and 2006 in the entire country, leading to 34–64 hospitalizations and 0–6 deaths per year, for an average fatality rate of 6.8%.<ref name="tokyo">[http://www.fukushihoken.metro.tokyo.jp/kenkou/anzen/anzen_info/shizendoku/hugu/ 危険がいっぱい ふぐの素人料理 東京都福祉保健局<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Of the 23 incidents recorded within Tokyo between 1993 and 2006, only one took place in a restaurant, while the others all involved fishermen eating their catch.<ref name="tokyo"/>

Only a few cases have been reported in the United States, and outbreaks in countries outside the Indo-Pacific area are rare, except in Haiti, where tetrodotoxin is thought by some believers in voodoo mythology<ref name="Hines"/> to assist the creation of so-called [[zombie]] poisons.<ref name="pmid3419200">{{cite journal | author = Anderson WH | title = Tetrodotoxin and the zombie phenomenon | journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–6 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3419200 | doi = 10.1016/0378-8741(88)90122-5 }}</ref>

Genetic background is not a factor in susceptibility to tetrodotoxin poisoning. This toxicosis may be avoided by not consuming animal species known to contain tetrodotoxin, principally pufferfish; other tetrodotoxic species are not usually consumed by humans. Poisoning from tetrodotoxin is of particular public health concern in Japan, where pufferfish "[[fugu]]" is a traditional delicacy. It is prepared and sold in special restaurants where trained and licensed [[chef]]s carefully remove the [[viscera]] to reduce the danger of poisoning. There is potential for misidentification and mislabelling, particularly of prepared, frozen fish products.

=== Food analysis ===
The mouse bioassay developed for [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]] (PSP) can be used to monitor tetrodotoxin in pufferfish and is the current method of choice. An [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] method with post-column reaction with alkali and fluorescence has been developed to determine tetrodotoxin and its associated toxins. The alkali degradation products can be confirmed as their [[trimethylsilyl]] derivatives by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

=== Detection in body fluids ===
Tetrodotoxin may be quantified in serum, whole blood or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. Most analytical techniques involve mass spectrometric detection following gas or liquid chromatographic separation.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1521–1522.</ref>

==Therapeutic Use==
Tetrodotoxin is being investigated as a possible treatment for cancer-associated pain. Early clinical trials demonstrate significant pain relief in some patients.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108870/</ref>

== Regulation ==

In the U.S., tetrodotoxin appears on the [[select agent]]s list of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]],<ref>HHS and USDA Select Agents and Toxins 7 CFR Part 331, 9 CFR Part 121, and 42 CFR Part 73. http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/docs/salist.pdf</ref> and scientists must register with HHS to use tetrodotoxin in their research. However, investigators possessing less than 100&nbsp;mg are exempt from regulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Permissible Toxin Amounts|url=http://www.selectagents.gov/Permissible%20Toxin%20Amounts.html|publisher=National Select Agent Registy|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>
