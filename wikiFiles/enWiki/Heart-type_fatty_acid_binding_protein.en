== Function ==

Heart-type Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (H-FABP) is a small cytoplasmic protein (15 kDa) released from cardiac [[myocyte]]s following an [[ischemia|ischemic]] episode.<ref name="pmid1480144">{{cite journal | author = Kleine AH, Glatz JF, Van Nieuwenhoven FA, Van der Vusse GJ | title = Release of heart fatty acid-binding protein into plasma after acute myocardial infarction in man | journal = Mol.

The intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins ([[fatty acid-binding protein|FABPs]]) belongs to a multigene family. FABPs are divided into at least three distinct types, namely the hepatic-, intestinal- and cardiac-type. They form 14-15 kDa proteins and are thought to participate in the uptake, intracellular metabolism and/or transport of [[Fatty_acid#Long_and_short|long-chain fatty acid]]s. They may also be responsible in the modulation of cell growth and proliferation. Fatty acid-binding protein 3 gene contains four exons and its function is to arrest growth of mammary [[epithelium|epithelial cell]]s. This gene is also a candidate tumor suppressor gene for human [[breast cancer]].<ref name="entrez"/>

H-FABP is recommended to be measured with [[troponin]] to identify myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome in patients presenting with chest pain.

== Prognostic potential ==

In addition to its diagnostic potential, H-FABP also has prognostic value.  Alongside D-dimer, NT-proBNP and peak troponin T, it was the only cardiac biomarker that proved to be a statistically significant predictor of death or Mi at one year.  This prognostic information was independent of troponin T, ECG and clinical examination.<ref name="pmid18682444"/>   The risk associated with raised H-FABP is dependent upon its concentration.<ref name="pmid18021874">{{cite journal | author = Kilcullen N, Viswanathan K, Das R, Morrell C, Farrin A, Barth JH, Hall AS | title = Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein predicts long-term mortality after acute coronary syndrome and identifies high-risk patients across the range of troponin values | journal = J.

If both biomarkers were negative, there is 0% mortality at 6 months, in the authors own words this “represents a particularly worthwhile clinical outcome, especially because it was observed in patients admitted into hospital for suspected ACS.”  H-FABP indicates risk across the ACS spectrum including UA, NSTEMI or STEMI where low H-FABP concentrations confer low risk whereas high H-FABP concentrations indicate patients who are at a much higher risk of future events.<ref name="pmid18021874"/>
