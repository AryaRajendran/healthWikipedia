An '''adverse drug reaction''' (abbreviated '''ADR''') is an expression that describes harm associated with the use of given [[medication]]s at a normal dosage during normal use. ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a [[drug]] or result from the combination of two or more drugs. The meaning of this expression differs from the meaning of "[[side effect]]", as this last expression might also imply that the effects can be beneficial.<ref name="pmid15148066" /> The  study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as ''[[pharmacovigilance]]''. An '''adverse drug event''' (abbreviated '''ADE''') refers to any injury caused by the drug (at normal dosage and/or due to overdose) and any harm associated with the use of the drug (e.g. discontinuation of drug therapy).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbm.va.gov/vamedsafe/Adverse%20Drug%20Reaction.pdf|title=Adverse Drug Events, Adverse Drug Reactions and Medication Errors|publisher=VA Center for Medication Safety|accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref> ADRs are a special type of ADEs.

==Classification==
ADRs may be classified by e.g. cause and severity.

===Cause===
*Type A: Augmented pharmacologic effects - dose dependent and predictable
**Intolerance
**Side Effects
*Type B: Bizarre effects (or [[idiosyncratic drug reaction|idiosyncratic]]) - dose independent and unpredictable
*Type C: Chronic effects
*Type D: Delayed effects
*Type E: End-of-treatment effects
*Type F: Failure of therapy
*Type G: Genetic reactions

Types A and B were proposed in the 1970s,<ref>Rawlins MD, Thompson JW. Pathogenesis of adverse drug reactions. In: Davies DM, ed. Textbook of adverse drug reactions. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977:10.</ref> and the other types were proposed subsequently when the first two proved insufficient to classify ADRs.<ref>Aronson JK. Drug therapy. In: Haslett C, Chilvers ER, Boon NA, Colledge NR, Hunter JAA, eds. Davidson's principles and practice of medicine 19th ed. Edinburgh: Elsevier Science, 2002:147-</ref>

===Seriousness and severity===
The American [[Food and Drug Administration]] defines a serious adverse event as one when the patient outcome is one of the following:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report/DESK/advevnt.htm |title=MedWatch - What Is A Serious Adverse Event? |accessdate=2007-09-18 |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070929095423/http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report/DESK/advevnt.htm| archivedate= 29 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
* Death
* Life-threatening
* Hospitalization (initial or prolonged)
* Disability - significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities or quality of life.
* Congenital anomaly
* Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage

Severity is a point on an arbitrary scale of intensity of the adverse event in question.  The terms "severe" and "serious" when applied to adverse events are technically very different. They are easily confused but can not be used interchangeably, requiring care in usage.

A headache is severe, if it causes intense pain. There are scales like "visual analog scale" that help us{{Who|date=January 2012}} assess the severity. On the other hand, a headache is not usually serious (but may be in case of subarachnoid haemorrhage, subdural bleed, even a migraine may temporally fit criteria), unless it also satisfies the criteria for seriousness listed above.

===Overall Drug Risk===
While no official scale exists yet to communicate overall drug risk, the [[iGuard]] Drug Risk Rating System is a five color rating scale similar to the [[Homeland Security Advisory System]]:<ref>{{cite news |title='Traffic-light' medicine risk website to launch |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2007-10-02 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/oct/02/7 | location=London | first=Marianne | last=Barriaux | accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>
* Red (high risk)
* Orange (elevated risk)
* Yellow (guarded risk)
* Blue (general risk)
* Green (low risk)

===Location===
[[Adverse effect]]s may be local, i.e. limited to a certain location, or systemic, where a medication has caused adverse effects throughout the [[systemic circulation]].

For instance, some [[ocular antihypertensive]]s cause systemic effects,<ref name=Rang146>{{cite book |author=Rang, H. P. |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-443-07145-4 |oclc= |doi=}} Page 146</ref> although they are administered locally as [[eye drop]]s, since a fraction escapes to the systemic circulation.

==Mechanisms==
As research better explains the biochemistry of drug use, fewer ADRs are Type B and more are Type A. Common mechanisms are:
* Abnormal pharmacokinetics due to
** [[Genetics|genetic]] factors
** [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] disease states
* [[Synergistic]] effects between either
** a drug and a disease
** two drugs

===Abnormal pharmacokinetics===

====Comorbid disease states====
Various diseases, especially those that cause [[renal failure|renal]] or [[liver failure|hepatic]] insufficiency, may alter drug metabolism. Resources are available that report changes in a drug's metabolism due to disease states.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaldruguse.com/ |title=Clinical Drug Use |accessdate=2007-09-18 |format= |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071101053341/http://www.clinicaldruguse.com/| archivedate= 1 November 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

====Genetic factors====
Abnormal drug metabolism may be due to inherited factors of either Phase I oxidation or Phase II conjugation.<ref name="pmid11710893">{{cite journal |author=Phillips KA, Veenstra DL, Oren E, Lee JK, Sadee W |title=Potential role of pharmacogenomics in reducing adverse drug reactions: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=286 |issue=18 |pages=2270–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11710893 |doi=10.1001/jama.286.18.2270}}</ref><ref name="pmid12571264">{{cite journal |author=Goldstein DB |title=Pharmacogenetics in the laboratory and the clinic |journal=N.

=====Phase I reactions=====
Inheriting abnormal [[allele]]s of [[cytochrome]] [[cytochrome P450|P450]] can  alter drug metabolism. Tables are available to check for drug interactions due to P450 interactions.<ref name="Drug-Interactions.com">{{cite web |url=http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart/ |title=Drug-Interactions.com |accessdate=2007-09-18 |format= |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070830145407/http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart/| archivedate= 30 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="pmid12571261">{{cite journal |author=Weinshilboum R |last2=Collins |first2=Francis S. |last3=Weinshilboum |first3=Richard |title=Inheritance and drug response |journal=N.

Inheriting abnormal [[Cholinesterase enzyme|butyrylcholinesterase]] ([[Cholinesterase enzyme|pseudocholinesterase]]) may affect metabolism of drugs such as [[succinylcholine]]<ref name="pmid12571262">{{cite journal |author=Evans WE, McLeod HL |title=Pharmacogenomics--drug disposition, drug targets, and side effects |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=348 |issue=6 |pages=538–49 |year=2003 |pmid=12571262 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra020526}}</ref>

=====Phase II reactions=====
Inheriting abnormal [[acetyltransferase|N-acetyltransferase]] which conjugated some drugs to facilitate excretion may affect the metabolism of drugs such as [[isoniazid]], [[hydralazine]], and [[procainamide]].<ref name="pmid12571261"/><ref name="pmid12571262"/>

Inheriting abnormal [[Thiopurine methyltransferase|thiopurine S-methyltransferase]] may affect the metabolism of the [[thiopurine]] drugs [[mercaptopurine]] and [[azathioprine]].<ref name="pmid12571261"/>

====Interactions with other drugs====
The risk of [[drug interaction]]s is increased with [[polypharmacy]].

=====Protein binding=====
These interactions are usually transient and mild until a new steady state is achieved.<ref name="pmid12473961">{{cite journal |author=DeVane CL |title=Clinical significance of drug binding, protein binding, and binding displacement drug interactions |journal=Psychopharmacology bulletin. |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=5–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12473961 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid11907485">{{cite journal |author=Benet LZ, Hoener BA |title=Changes in plasma protein binding have little clinical relevance |journal=Clin.

The principal plasma proteins for drug binding are:<ref name="pmid12369572">{{cite journal |author=Sands CD, Chan ES, Welty TE |title=Revisiting the significance of warfarin protein-binding displacement interactions |journal=The Annals of pharmacotherapy |volume=36 |issue=10 |pages=1642–4 |year=2002 |pmid=12369572 |doi=10.1345/aph.1A208|url=http://www.theannals.com/cgi/reprint/36/10/1642}}</ref>
# [[albumin]]
# α1-acid glycoprotein
# lipoproteins
Some drug interactions with [[warfarin]] are due to changes in protein binding.<ref name="pmid12369572"/>

=====Cytochrome P450=====
Patients have abnormal metabolism by [[cytochrome]] [[cytochrome P450|P450]] due to either inheriting abnormal [[allele]]s or due to drug interactions. Tables are available to check for drug interactions due to P450 interactions.<ref name="Drug-Interactions.com"/>

===Synergistic effects===
An example of synergism is two drugs that both prolong the [[QT interval]].

==Assessing causality==
Causality assessment is used to determine the likelihood that a drug caused a suspected ADR. There are a number of different methods used to judge causation, including the [[Naranjo algorithm]], the Venulet algorithm and the WHO causality term assessment criteria. Each have pros and cons associated with their use and most require some level of expert judgement to apply.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davies EC |title= An Investigation of Disagreement in Causality Assessment of Adverse Drug Reactions | url= http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2011/25010/An_Investigation_of_Disagreement_in_Causality.3.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=17–24 |year=2011 |author-separator=, |author2=Rowe PH |author3=James S |display-authors=3 |doi=10.2165/11539800-000000000-00000 |author4=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref>
An ADR should not be labeled as 'certain' unless the ADR abates with a [[challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge]] protocol (stopping and starting the agent in question). The chronology of the onset of the suspected ADR is important, as another substance or factor may be implicated as a cause; co-prescribed medications and underlying psychiatric conditions may be factors in the ADR.   
A simple scale is available at [http://annals.org/cgi/content/full/140/10/795#T2 http://annals.org/cgi/content/full/140/10/795].<ref name="pmid15148066">{{cite journal |author=Nebeker JR, Barach P, Samore MH |title=Clarifying adverse drug events: a clinician's guide to terminology, documentation, and reporting |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=140 |issue=10 |pages=795–801 |year=2004 |pmid=15148066 |doi=}}</ref>

Assigning causality to a specific agent often proves difficult, unless the event is found during a clinical study or large databases are used. Both methods have difficulties and can be fraught with error. Even in clinical studies some ADRs may be missed as large numbers of test individuals are required to find that adverse drug reaction. Psychiatric ADRs are often missed as they are grouped together in the questionnaires used to assess the population [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20852483] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20852483] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14626141].

==Monitoring bodies==
Many countries have official bodies that monitor drug safety and reactions. On an international level, the [[WHO]] runs the [[Uppsala Monitoring Centre]], and the [[European Union]] runs the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA). In the [[United States]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is responsible for monitoring post-marketing studies.
In Canada, the Marketed Products Directorate of Health Canada is responsible for the surveillance of marketed health products.
