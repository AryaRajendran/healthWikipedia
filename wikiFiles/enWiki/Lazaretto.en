A '''lazaretto''' or '''lazaret''' is a [[quarantine]] station for maritime travellers.  Lazarets can be ships permanently at anchor, isolated islands, or mainland buildings.  Until 1908, lazarets were also used for disinfecting postal items, usually by [[fumigation]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2005|

== Lazarettos throughout history ==

In 1726, a lazaretto was built on [[Gżira#Manoel Island|Manoel Island]] located in [[Malta]]. Its remains are still standing.

[[Lazaretto island (Corfu)|Lazaretto Island]] (formerly known as Aghios Dimitrios) is located two [[nautical mile]]s  north-east of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] ({{Coord|39.641|19.924}}). In the early 16th century, when Corfu was under Venetian rule, a monastery was established on the islet. Later that century, the island was renamed Lazaretto, after the leprosarium that was set up there. In 1798, when the French ruled Corfu, the Russo-Turkish fleet took over the islet and ran it as a military hospital. In 1814, during the British occupation, the leprosarium was renovated and went into operation again. After the Ionian Islands were united with Greece (1864), the leprosarium only operated when needed.

[[Lazaretto Islet]] survives on [[Ithaca]] and another on [[Zakynthos]].

[[Fidra]], an uninhabited island in the [[Firth of Forth]] in eastern [[Scotland]], has the ruins of an old chapel, dedicated to [[St. Nicholas]], which was used as a lazaretto.<ref name=history>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=43439&strquery=fidrey#s30 British History Online]</ref>

During the [[Nazi]] occupation of Poland, the German-run [[Treblinka]] extermination camp had a pit where new arrivals who were severely ill would be shot; the staff's euphemistic name for this area was the lazaret.

As of 2002, one of the few remaining lazarets in Europe is the one in [[Dubrovnik]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2005|
