The '''basal''' or '''basic electrical rhythm''' ('''BER''') or '''electrical control activity''' ('''ECA''') determines the frequency of the contractions in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] (GI) tract.

==Physiology==
[[Smooth muscle]] within the GI tract causes the involuntary [[Peristalsis|peristaltic]] motion that moves consumed food down the [[esophagus]] and towards the [[rectum]].<ref name=Wood>{{citation |title=Medical Physiology: Principles for Clinical Medicine |edition=3 |last=Wood |first=Jackie D. |chapter=Gastrointestinal Physiology |pages=463â€“496 |editor1-first=Rodney A. |editor1-last=Rhoades |editor2-first=David R. |editor2-last=Bell |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia, PA |year=2009}}</ref>  The smooth muscle throughout most of the GI tract is divided into two layers: an outer longitudinal layer and an inner circular layer.<ref name=Wood/>  Both layers of muscle are located within the [[muscularis externa]].  The stomach has a third layer: an innermost oblique layer.

The physical contractions of the smooth muscle cells can be caused by [[action potential]]s in [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] [[motor neuron]]s of the [[enteric nervous system]], or by receptor mediated calcium influx.<ref name=Wood/>  The inner circular layer is innervated by both excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons, while the outer longitudinal layer is innervated by mainly excitatory neurons.  These action potentials cause the smooth muscle cells to contract or relax, depending on the particular stimulation the cells receive.  Longitudinal muscle fibers depend on calcium influx into the cell for [[excitation-contraction coupling]], while circular muscle fibers rely on intracellular calcium release.  Contraction of the smooth muscle can occur when the BER reaches its plateau (an absolute value less than -45mV){{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} while a simultaneous stimulatory action potential occurs.  A contraction will not occur unless an action potential occurs.  Generally, BER waves stimulate action potentials and action potentials stimulate contractions.

The [[interstitial cells of Cajal]] are specialized pacemaker cells located in the wall of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.<ref name=Wood/>  These cells are connected to the smooth muscle via [[gap junction]]s and the [[myenteric plexus]].  The cell membranes of the pacemaker cells undergo a rhythmic [[depolarization]] and repolarization from -65[[Volt|mV]] to -45mV.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  This rhythm of depolarization-repolarization of the cell membrane creates a slow wave known as a BER, and it is transmitted to the smooth muscle cells.  The frequency of these depolarizations in a region of the GI tract determines the possible frequency of contractions.  In order for a contraction to occur, a [[hormone]] or [[Chemical synapse|neurocrine]] signal must induce the smooth muscle cell to have an action potential.  The basal electrical rhythm allows the smooth muscle cell to depolarize and contract rhythmically when exposed to hormonal signals.  This action potential is transmitted to other smooth muscle cells via gap junctions, creating a peristaltic wave.

==Frequency==
The number of action potentials during the plateau of a particular BER slow wave can vary.  Multiple action potentials during the same slow wave peak create a stronger muscle contraction.

The frequency of the BER, and thus the contractions, changes throughout the GI tract.  The [[frequency]] in the stomach is 3 per minute, while the [[duodenum]] is 11 to 12 per minute and the [[ileum]] is 9 per minute.<ref name=Wood/>  The colon can have a BER frequency between 2 and 13 per minute. The electrical activity is oscillatory, so that the BER has peaks and valleys when graphed over time.
