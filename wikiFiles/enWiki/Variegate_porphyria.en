The disorder results from low levels of the [[enzyme]] responsible for the seventh step in [[heme]] production. Heme is a vital molecule for all of the body's organs. It is a component of [[hemoglobin]], the molecule that carries [[oxygen]] in the [[blood]].

==Symptoms==
Many people with this disorder never experience [[symptom]]s. When symptoms occur, they can include acute attacks (similar to [[acute intermittent porphyria]]), skin damage, or both. Acute attacks usually begin in adulthood and cause abdominal pain, [[vomiting]], [[diarrhoea]] and [[constipation]]. During an attack, a person may also experience muscle weakness, [[seizure]]s, and mental changes such as anxiety and [[hallucination]]s. These signs and symptoms are triggered by nongenetic factors such as certain drugs, dieting or fasting, certain [[hormone]]s and stress.

Some people with variegate porphyria have skin that is overly sensitive to [[sunlight]]. Areas of skin exposed to the sun develop severe blistering, scarring, changes in [[pigmentation]], and increased hair growth. Exposed skin becomes fragile and is easily damaged.

Rarely, the signs and symptoms of variegate porphyria can begin in infancy or early childhood. In such cases, the signs and symptoms are usually more severe than those starting later in life. In addition to the health problems described above, children with this disorder may have mental retardation and grow more slowly than other children.

==Epidemiology==
In [[South Africa]], the prevalence of variegate porphyria is approximately 1 in 300.<ref name=Hann2006>{{Cite book  | last1 = Arceci | first1 = Robert. | last2 = Hann | first2 = Ian M. | last3 = Smith | first3 = Owen P. | title = Pediatric hematolog | year = 2006 | publisher = Blackwell Pub. | location = Malden, Mass. | isbn = 978-1-4051-3400-2 | pages =  }}</ref> In Finland, the prevalence is approximately 1 in 75.000.<ref>{{cite pmid|7433635}}</ref>

When it does occur in other populations (such as [[Switzerland]]), it can be with different mutations than in South Africa.<ref name="pmid16947091">{{cite journal |author=Schneider-Yin X, Minder EI |title=Swiss patients with variegate porphyria have unique mutations |journal=Swiss Med Wkly |volume=136 |issue=31–32 |pages=515–9 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16947091 |doi= |url=http://www.smw.ch/dfe/set_archiv.asp?target=2006/31/smw-11472}}</ref>

==Genetics==

[[Image:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|Variegate porphyria has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.]]

[[Mutation]]s in the [[PPOX]] [[gene]] cause variegate porphyria.<ref name="pmid10343202">{{cite journal |author=Frank J, Christiano AM |title=Variegate porphyria: past, present and future |journal=Skin Pharmacol. Appl. Skin Physiol. |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=310–20 |year=1998 |pmid=10343202 |doi= |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=sph11310}}</ref> The PPOX gene makes a membrane bound [[mitochondria]]l enzyme called [[protoporphyrinogen oxidase]], which is critical to the chemical process that leads to heme production. The activity of this enzyme is reduced by 50 percent in most people with variegate porphyria. In severe cases that begin early in life, the enzyme is almost completely inactive. Nongenetic factors such as certain drugs, stress, and others listed above can increase the demand for heme and the enzymes required to make heme. The combination of this increased demand and reduced activity of [[protoporphyrinogen oxidase]] disrupts heme production and allows byproducts of the process to accumulate in the liver, triggering an acute attack.

Variegate porphyria is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and inheriting one copy of the defective gene from an affected parent is sufficient to cause the disorder. More severe cases result from inheriting two copies of the defective gene.

The entire PPOX gene has about 8kb with 13 exon sequences.  It was successfully cloned from a cDNA library in 1995 revealing that, after processing, it is 477 [[nucleotide]]s long.  It has previously been thought that the PPOX gene was located on human [[chromosome 14]],<ref name="pmid3261272">{{cite journal |author=Bissbort S, Hitzeroth HW, du Wentzel DP, ''et al.'' |title=Linkage between the variegate porphyria (VP) and the alpha-1-antitrypsin (PI) genes on human chromosome 14 |journal=Hum.
