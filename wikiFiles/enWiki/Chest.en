{{Prose|date=June 2008}}
In [[Hominidae|hominid]]s, the '''chest''' is the region of the body between the [[neck]] and the [[abdomen]], along with its internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] and other contents. It is mostly protected and supported by the [[ribcage]], [[vertebral column|spine]], and [[shoulder]] girdle. Contents of the chest include the following:
*organs
**[[heart]]
**[[lungs]]
**[[Thymus]]

In humans, the portion of the chest protected by the ribcage is also called the [[thorax]].

== Chest injury ==
Injury to the chest (also referred to as chest trauma, thoracic injury, or thoracic trauma) results in up to ¼ of all deaths due to [[Physical trauma|trauma]] in the United States.<ref>Shahani, Rohit, MD. (2005).  [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2916.htm Penetrating Chest Trauma].  ''eMedicine''. Retrieved 2005-02-05.</ref>

==Chest diseases==
Different types of [[diseases]] or conditions that can be experienced in the chest include [[pleurisy]], [[flail chest]], [[atelectasis]], and the most common condition, chest pain. These conditions can be caused by [[birth defects]], trauma, or in some cases because of heredity. It is important that all conditions are discussed with a physician and not diagnosed to ensure that proper treatment is given. Any condition that lowers the ability to breathe deeply or decreases a persons ability to [[cough]] is considered a chest disease or condition.

==Chest pain==
Chest pain can be the result of multiple issues including [[respiratory]] problems, [[digestion|digestive]] issues, [[musculoskeletal]] complications. The pain can trigger cardiac issues as well. Not all pain that is felt is associated with the heart, but it should not be taken lightly either. Symptoms can be different depending on the cause of the pain.<ref>[http://www.chestdiseases.net/ Chest Diseases] Retrieved on 2010-1-26</ref> While cardiac issues cause feelings of sudden pressure in the chest or a crushing pain in the back, neck and arms, pain that is felt due to non cardiac issues gives a burning feeling along the digestive tract or pain when deep breaths are attempted. It is important to understand that pains will be felt differently for each person even if they are experiencing the same condition. Only a patient will truly know if the symptoms are something mild or serious.

Chest pain may be a symptom of [[myocardial infarctions]]. If this condition is present in the body, discomfort will be felt in the chest that is similar to a heavy weight being placed on the body. Sweating, shortness of breath, [[lightheadedness]], and [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|irregular heartbeat]] can also be experienced. If heart attack occurs, the bulk of damage is caused during the first six hours, so getting the proper treatment quickly as possible is important. Some people, especially those who are elderly or have diabetes, may not have typical chest pain but may have many of the other symptoms of a heart attack. It is important that these patients and their care givers have a good understanding of heart attack symptoms.

==Non cardiac causes of chest pain==
Just like with a heart attack, not all chest pain is suffered because of a condition involving the [[heart]]. Chest wall pain can be experienced after an increase in activity. Persons who add exercise to their daily routine generally feel this type of pain at the beginning. It is important to monitor the pain to ensure that it is not a sign of something more serious. Pain can also be experienced in persons who have an upper respiratory [[infection]]. This virus will also be accompanied by fever and cough. [[Shingles]] is another viral infection that can give symptoms of chest or rib pain before a rash develops. Injuries to the rib cage or sternum is also a common cause of chest pain. It is generally felt when deep breaths are taken or during cough.

===Atelectasis===
Another non cardiac cause of chest pain is [[atelectasis]]. It is a condition that suffered when a portion of the lung collapses from being airless. When bronchial tubes are blocked, this condition develops and will cause patients to feel a shortness of breath. The most common cause of atelectasis is when a bronchi that extends from the windpipe is blocked and traps air. The blockage may be caused by something inside the [[bronchus]], such as a plug of mucus, a [[tumour]], or an inhaled foreign object such as a coin, piece of food, or a toy.<ref>[http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec04/ch048/ch048a.html Atelectasis] Lung and Airway Disorders. Retrieved on 2010-1-26</ref> It is possible for something outside of the bronchus to cause the blockage.

===Pneumothorax===
[[Pneumothorax]] is air or gas can build up in the [[pleural]] space. It can occur without a known cause or as the result of a lung disease or acute lung injury.<ref>[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/pleurisy/pleurisy_whatare.html Pleurisy] Lung Diseases. Retrieved on 2010-1-26</ref> The size of the pneumothorax will change as the liquid builds up, so a medical procedure can be used to drain the liquid with a needle. If it is untreated, blood flow can be interrupted and cause a drop in blood pressure known as tension pneumothorax. It is possible for smaller cases to clear up on their own. Symptoms of this condition are often felt only on one side of the lung or as a shortness of breath.

===Cancer of the lung===
[[Cancer]] that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells lining air passages.<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/lung Lung Cancer] Cancer.Gov. Retrieved on 2010-1-26</ref> In 90% of patients, the cause for lung cancer is [[tobacco]] use. Other causes of lung cancer include secondhand smoke, air pollution, asbestos, and lung diseases like [[tuberculosis]] (TB) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cancer occurs when normal cells undergo a transformation that causes them to grow and multiply without the normal controls.<ref>[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/lung_cancer/article_em.htm eMedicineHealth.com] Lung Cancer Symptoms, Causes, Treatment, Stages and Prevention. Retrieved on 2010-1-26</ref> Symptoms include persistent cough, [[hemoptysis]], and chest pain. Many chest disease are experienced by a person diagnosed with lung cancer and should not be taken lightly. Proper treatment of the underlying cause or new ailments will help with the treatment of the cancer.

In the [[human body]], the '''chest''' is the body region between the [[neck]] and [[diaphragm]] in the front of the body. The corresponding area in an animal can be referred to as the chest. The chest holds many important internal, and is protected by the [[ribcage]].

It is important to realize that the shape of the chest does not correspond to that of the bony [[thorax]] which encloses the [[heart]] and [[lungs]]; all the breadth of the shoulders is due to the shoulder girdle, and contains the [[axilla]] and the head of the [[humerus]].  In the middle line the [[suprasternal notch]] is seen above, while about three fingers' breadth below it a transverse ridge can be felt, which is known as [[Ludovic's angle]] and marks the junction between the manubrium and gladiolus of the [[sternum]].  Level with this line the second ribs join the sternum, and when these are found the lower ribs may be easily counted in a moderately thin subject.  At the lower part of the sternum, where the seventh or last true ribs join it, the ensiform [[cartilage]] begins, and over this there is often a depression popularly known as the pit of the [[stomach]].  
Path physiology :
The major pat physiologies' encountered in blunt chest trauma involve derangements in the flow of air, blood, or both in combination. Sepsis due to leakage of alimentary tract contents, as in esophageal perforations, also must be considered.
Blunt trauma commonly results in chest wall injuries (e.g., rib fractures). The pain associated with these injuries can make breathing difficult, and this may compromise ventilation.
Direct lung injuries, such as pulmonary contusions (see the image below), are frequently associated with major chest trauma and may impair ventilation by a similar mechanism.

The [[nipple]] in the male is situated in front of the fourth rib or a little below; vertically it lies a little external to a line drawn down from the middle of the [[clavicle]]; in the female it is not so constant.  A little below it the lower limit of the great pectoral muscle is seen running upward and outward to the axilla; in the female this is obscured by the [[breast]], which extends from the second to the sixth rib vertically and from the edge of the sternum to the mid-axillary line laterally.  The female nipple is surrounded for half an inch by a more or less pigmented disc, the [[areola]].  The apex of a normal heart is in the fifth left intercostal space, three and a half inches from the mid-line.
