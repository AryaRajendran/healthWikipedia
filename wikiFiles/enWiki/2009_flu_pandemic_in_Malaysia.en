== Terminology ==
The flu virus is [[2009 flu pandemic#Nomenclature debate|officially designated by the WHO]] as "Influenza A (H1N1)", following a name change from "swine flu" to avoid suggestions that eating pork products carried a risk of infection, and is referred as such by Malaysia's Health Minister. However, Information Communication and Culture Minister [[Rais Yatim]] suggested on June 25 that the local media use "swine flu" ({{lang-ms|selsema babi}}) instead, justifying that the dangers of the flu would be better understood by the public, and that the flu would be easily described in [[Malay language|Malay]], a language which is officially used in news programmers of government-owned television and radio channels.<ref name="Rais selsema babi">{{cite web| url = http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/news_lite.php?id=420863 | title = Rais Suggests Media Use "Swine Flu" Instead | date = 2009-06-25 | accessdate = 2009-06-26 | publisher = [[Bernama]]}}</ref>
