'''Psychic surgery''' is a form of [[medical fraud]], a [[pseudoscientific]] procedure typically involving the pretense of creating an [[incision]] using only the bare hands, the removal of [[pathological]] matter, and finally the spontaneous healing of the incision.<ref

==Procedure==
Although psychic surgery varies by region and practitioner, it usually follows some common lines. Without the use of a surgical instrument, a practitioner will press the tips of his/her fingers against the patient's skin in the area to be treated. The practitioner's hands appear to penetrate into the patient's body painlessly and blood seems to flow. The practitioner will then show organic matter or foreign objects apparently removed from the patient's body, clean the area, and then end the procedure with the patient's skin showing no wounds or scars.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Most cases do not involve actual surgery although some practitioners make real incisions.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Spence| first = Lewis | title = Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology Vol. 2| publisher = Kessinger Publishing Co| year = 2003| pages = 750| isbn = 978-0-7661-2817-0}}</ref> In regions of the world where belief in evil spirits is prevalent, practitioners will sometimes exhibit objects, such as glass, explaining that the foreign bodies were placed in the patient's body by evil spirits.<ref name="pmid2110023" />

==History==
Accounts of [[psychic]] surgery started to  appear in the [[Spiritualist]] communities of the [[Philippines]] and [[Brazil]] in the mid-1900s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, the procedure was first noticed in the 1940s, when performed routinely by Eleuterio Terte. Terte and his pupil Tony Agpaoa, who was apparently associated with the ''Union Espiritista Christiana de Filipinas'' (The Christian Spiritist Union of the Philippines), trained others in this procedure.<ref name="pmid2110023" />

In 1959, the procedure came to the attention of the  U. S. public after the publication of ''Into the Strange Unknown'' by Ron Ormond and [[Ormond McGill]]. The authors called the practice "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]al surgery,"  and wrote "[we] still don’t know what to think; but we have motion pictures to show it wasn’t the work of any normal magician, and could very well be just what the Filipinos said it was — a miracle of God performed by a fourth dimensional surgeon."<ref name="ISU">{{Cite book

[[Alex Orbito]], who became well known in the U. S. through his association with actress [[Shirley MacLaine]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Filipino psychic takes Indians for a ride - By N. Bhanutej|publisher=The Week (India)|date=September 8, 2002|accessdate=August 19, 2007}}</ref> was one said practitioner of the procedure. On June 14, 2005, Orbito was  arrested by Canadian authorities and indicted for fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filipinoreporter.com/archive/3327/headline03.htm |title=The Filipino Reporter |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}</ref> On Jan 20, 2006, the charges were dropped as it then seemed unlikely that Orbito would be convicted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filipinoreporter.com/archive/3424/headline05.htm |title=The Filipino Reporter |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}</ref> 

Psychic surgery made U.S. tabloid headlines in March 1984 when entertainer [[Andy Kaufman]], diagnosed with [[large cell]] [[carcinoma]] (a rare [[lung cancer]]), traveled to the Philippines for a six-week course of psychic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.benatural.org/psychic-surgery.html |title=, Psychic Surgery |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}</ref> Practitioner Jun Labo claimed to have removed large cancerous tumors and Kaufman declared he believed this cancer had been removed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Kaufman died from renal failure as consequence of a [[metastasis|metastatic]] lung cancer, on May 16, 1984.<ref>[http://vitals.rootsweb.com/ca/death/search.cgi California Death Index]</ref>

===Brazil===
The origins of the practice in Brazil are obscure; but by the late 1950s several "spiritual healers" were practicing in the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Many of them were associated with  [[Kardecism]], a major [[spiritualism|spiritualistic]] movement in [[Brazil]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, and claimed to be performing their operations merely as [[Mediumship|channels]] for spirits of deceased medical doctors.<ref name="YO" /> Others were following practices and rituals known as "[[Umbanda]]", a [[shamanic]] [[Orthopraxis|ritualistic]] religion  with [[mediumistic]] overtones inherited from the African slaves brought to the country in colonial times.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

A known Brazilian psychic healer who routinely practiced psychic surgery was [[Zé Arigó]], who claimed to be channeling for a deceased medical doctor of name [[Dr. Fritz]]. Unlike most other psychic healers, who work bare-handed, Arigó used a non surgical blade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Arigo,%20Jose.html |title=James Randi Educational Foundation — Arigó, José  |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}</ref> Other psychic healers who claimed to channel for Dr. Fritz were [[Edson Queiroz]] and [[Rubens Farias Jr.]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E1DD1039F931A25752C0A960958260&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Rio Journal;Live, in Brazil (Again): The Reincarnated Dr. Fritz - New York Times |accessdate=2007-08-19 |format= |work=The New York Times | date=1996-01-12}}</ref> Popular today (especially abroad) is João de Faria, also known as [[João de Deus (medium)|João de Deus]], a [[quack]] operating in [[Abadiânia]], state of [[Goiás]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/johnofgod.html |title=John of God |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}</ref>

According to the descriptions of [[Yoshiaki Omura]], Brazilian psychic surgery appears to be different from that practiced in the Philippines. Omura calls attention to the fact that practitioners in Brazil use techniques resembling [[Qigong]], [[Shiatsu]] massage, and [[chiropractic]] manipulation. Some patients are also injected with a brown liquid, and alleged minor surgery was performed in about 20% of the cases observed.<ref>Omura Y. Impression on observing psychic surgery and healing in Brazil which appear to incorporate (+) qi gong energy & the use of acupuncture points. Acupunct Electrother Res. 1997;22(1):17-33. PMID 9188913</ref> While Arigó performed his procedures using kitchen knives in improvised settings, Omura reports that the clamping of blood vessels and the closing of the surgical wounds are now performed by licensed surgeons or licensed nurses.<ref name="YO">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aegis.com/aidsline/1997/oct/M97A0099.html |title=Yoshiaki Omura on psychic surgery in Brazil |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}</ref>

==Medical and legal criticism==
In  1975, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] declared that "'psychic surgery' "is nothing but a total [[hoax]]"."<ref name=FTC1 /> Judge Daniel H. Hanscom, when granting the FTC an injunction against travel agencies promoting psychic surgery tours, declared: "Psychic surgery is pure and unmitigated fakery. The 'surgical operations' of psychic surgeons ... with their bare hands are simply phony."<ref>"F.T.C. Curbs Philippines Flights For Cures by 'Psychic Surgery'"; New York Times March 15, 1975, p. 11 (Judge Hanscom: "pure and unmitigated fakery... simply phony")</ref>

In 1990, the [[American Cancer Society]] stated that it "found no evidence that "psychic surgery" results in objective benefit in the treatment of any medical condition," and strongly urged individuals who are ill not to seek treatment by psychic surgery.<ref name="pmid2110023" />

The [[BC Cancer Agency|British Columbia Cancer Agency]] "strongly urges individuals who are ill not to seek treatment by psychic surgeon."<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/UnconventionalTherapies/PsychicSurgery.htm | title=Unconventional therapies--Psychic surgery | publisher=British Columbia Cancer Agency  |date = February 2000| first= | last= | accessdate =2007-04-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070202112741/http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/UnconventionalTherapies/PsychicSurgery.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-02}}</ref>

While not directly hazardous to the patient, the belief in the alleged benefits of psychic surgery may carry considerable risk for individuals with diagnosed medical conditions, as they may delay or forgo conventional medical help, sometimes with fatal consequences.<ref name="pmid2110023" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncahf.org/pp/faith.html |title=NCAHF Statements on Faith Healing and Psychic Surgery |accessdate=2007-08-19 |work=}}</ref>

==Accusations of fraud==
Stage magician [[James Randi]] says psychic surgery is a [[sleight-of-hand]] [[confidence trick]]. He has said that in personal observations of the procedure, and in movies showing the procedures, he can spot sleight-of-hand moves that are evident to experienced stage magicians, but might deceive a casual observer. Randi has replicated the appearance of psychic surgery himself through the use of  sleight-of-hand.<ref>The following images are of Randi demonstrating "psychic surgery":
* [http://www.csicop.org/webmaster/randi/prepare.jpg prepare]
* [http://www.csicop.org/webmaster/randi/go-in.jpg go in]
* [http://www.csicop.org/webmaster/randi/come-out.jpg come out]</ref> Professional magicians [[Milbourne Christopher]] and Robert Gurtler have also observed psychic surgeons at work, and say they have spotted the use of sleight-of-hand. On his A&E show ''[[Criss Angel Mindfreak|Mindfreak]]'' in the episode "Sucker," illusionist Criss Angel performed "Psychic Surgery," showing first-hand how it may be done (fake blood, plastic bags and chicken livers were used).

Randi says the healer would slightly roll or pinch the skin over the area to be treated. When his flattened hand reaches under the roll of skin, it looks and feels as if the practitioner is actually entering into the patient's body. The healer would have prepared in advance small pellets or bags of animal entrails which would be palmed in his hand  or hidden beneath the table within easy reach. This organic matter would simulate the "diseased" tissue that the healer would claim to be removing.  If the healer wants to simulate bleeding, he might squeeze a bladder of animal blood or an impregnated sponge. If done properly,  this procedure may deceive patients and observers. However, some "psychic surgery" procedures do not rely solely on the "sleight of hand" described, as at least one [[João de Deus (medium)|Brazilian "surgeon"]] also cuts his victims' skin with an unsterilised scalpel to heighten the illusion.<ref>[http://www.randi.org/jr/021805a.html#5 Commentary, February 18, 2005, A Special Analysis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The practitioners are using [[sleight of hand]] techniques to produce [[blood]] or blood-like fluids, animal [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] or substitutes, and/or various foreign objects from folds of skin of the patient as part of a [[confidence game]] for financial benefit of the practitioner.

Two "psychic surgeons" provided testimony in a [[Federal Trade Commission]] trial that, to their knowledge, the organic matter supposedly removed from the patients usually consists of animal tissue and clotted blood.<ref name="pmid2110023"/>

==In popular culture==
*In the 1989 film ''[[Penn & Teller Get Killed]]'', comedic magicians [[Penn and Teller]] demonstrate how to perform the illusion of psychic surgery.
*A 1989 episode of [[Unsolved Mysteries]] featured a police officer whose mother claimed to have been cured by psychic surgery, only to die shortly thereafter; her autopsy revealed several tumors. The policeman described himself going undercover to feign illness and pretended to desire psychic surgery, having the feeling of the practitioner using sleight of hand to supposedly dig into his tissue, as well as suspecting that the "cysts" and "tumors" being removed from his body were actually ready-made chicken parts.
*In the TV show ''[[Criss Angel Mindfreak]]'', Season 2 Episode "Sucker", Criss explains psychic surgery as a deception.
*In the 1999 movie ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'', a movie based on the life of [[Andy Kaufman]], Kaufman receives psychic surgery and notices the "sleight of hand," laughing in seeming despair. He is next seen dead, with his funeral being conducted.
*In the television show ''[[1000 Ways to Die]]'', a con artist was using this to scam poor country people, only to lead to his death when he used it on a [[leper]] from whom he caught the disease.
*In the April 14th, 1999 episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'', "[[Milagro (The X-Files)|Milagro]]", a man is suspected of using psychic surgery for murder.
*In the TV series ''[[Angel (TV series)]]'', Season 1 episode "[[I Fall to Pieces (Angel)]]" features a doctor who practices psychic surgery.
*In the [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Full Circle with Michael Palin]]'', [[Michael Palin]] witnesses two separate instances of psychic surgery in the [[Baguio]] district of the Philippines. On raising his suspicion with the medic that it seemed a sleight of hand to him, the medic told him he was a westerner and could only understand the surgery if he had a [[third eye]]. Michael assists another medic in a surgery and was told that no contamination happens in this procedure because of the use of [[garlic]].
*In the 1998 Christmas Special of the BBC TV series [[Jonathan Creek]] "[[List_of_Jonathan_Creek_episodes#Christmas_Special_.281998.29|Black Canary]]" the husband of the illusionist known as Black Canary, undergoes Psychic surgery at the start of the episode and this form of surgery forms a plot device throughout the special.
