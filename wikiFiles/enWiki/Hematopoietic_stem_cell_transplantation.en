'''Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation''' (HSCT) is the transplantation of [[multipotent hematopoietic stem cell]]s, usually derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. It is a medical procedure in the fields of [[hematology]] and [[oncology]], most often performed for patients with certain [[cancer]]s of the [[blood]] or [[bone marrow]], such as [[multiple myeloma]] or [[leukemia]]. In these cases, the recipient's immune system is usually destroyed with radiation or chemotherapy before the transplantation. Infection and [[graft-versus-host disease]] is a major complication of allogenic HSCT.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains a dangerous procedure with many possible complications; it is reserved for patients with life-threatening diseases. As the survival of the procedure increases, its use has expanded beyond cancer, such as autoimmune diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tyndall A, Fassas A, Passweg J, ''et al.'' |title=Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplants for autoimmune disease--feasibility and transplant-related mortality.

==History==
[[Georges Mathé]], a French oncologist, performed the first European bone marrow transplant in 1959 on five Yugoslavian nuclear workers whose own marrow had been damaged by irradiation caused by a [[Criticality accident]] at the [[Vinča Nuclear Institute]], but all of these transplants were rejected.<ref>McLaughlin et al. page 96, "Radiation doses were intense, being estimated at 205, 320, 410, 415, 422, and 433 [[Röntgen equivalent man|rem]].74 Of the six persons present, one died and the other five recovered after severe cases of radiation sickness."</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1958YUG1.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=1958-01-01}}</ref><ref>[http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1958YUG1.html Vinca reactor accident, 1958], compiled by Wm.

This has allowed HSCT to be conducted in the elderly and other patients who would otherwise be considered too weak to withstand a conventional treatment regimen.

===Number of procedures===
A total of 50,417 first hematopoietic stem cell transplants were reported as taking place worldwide in 2006, according to a global survey of 1327 centers in 71 countries conducted by the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.  Of these, 28,901 (57%) were autologous and 21,516 (43%) were allogeneic (11,928 from family donors and 9,588 from unrelated donors).  The main indications for transplant were lymphoproliferative disorders (54.5%) and leukemias (33.8%), and the majority took place in either Europe (48%) or the Americas (36%).<ref name="Gratwohl">{{cite journal |author= Gratwohl A, Baldomero H, Aljurf M, ''et al.'' |title=Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a global perspective |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=16 |pages=1617–24 |year=2010 |pmid=20424252 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.491 |pmc=3219875}}</ref>  In 2009, according to the world marrow donor association, stem cell products provided for unrelated transplantation worldwide had increased to 15,399 (3,445 bone marrow donations, 8,162 peripheral blood stem cell donations, and 3,792 cord blood units).<ref>Charts from {{cite web |publisher=World Marrow Donor Association |title=Annual Report, 2009 |url=http://www.worldmarrow.org/fileadmin/WorkingGroups_Subcommittees/DRWG/Figures_WMDA_Website.pdf }}</ref>

==Graft types==

===Autologous===
Autologous HSCT requires the extraction ([[apheresis]]) of haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from the patient and storage of the harvested cells in a freezer. The patient is then treated with high-dose [[chemotherapy]] with or without [[radiotherapy]] with the intention of eradicating the patient's malignant cell population at the cost of partial or complete [[bone marrow]] ablation (destruction of patient's bone marrow function to grow new blood cells).  The patient's own stored stem cells are then transfused into his/her bloodstream, where they replace destroyed tissue and resume the patient's normal blood cell production. Autologous transplants have the advantage of lower risk of infection during the immune-compromised portion of the treatment since the recovery of immune function is rapid. Also, the incidence of patients experiencing rejection ([[graft-versus-host disease]]) is very rare due to the donor and recipient being the same individual. These advantages have established autologous HSCT as one of the standard second-line treatments for such diseases as [[lymphoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Canellos, George |title=The Role of Salvage Therapy in Malignant Lymphomas |journal=The Oncologist |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=181–183 |year=1997}}</ref> However, for others such as [[Acute Myeloid Leukemia]], the reduced mortality of the autogenous relative to allogeneic HSCT may be outweighed by an increased likelihood of cancer relapse and related mortality, and therefore the allogeneic treatment may be preferred for those conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bruno B, Rotta M, Patriarca F, ''et al.'' |title=A comparison of allografting with autografting for newly diagnosed myeloma |journal=N.

===Allogeneic===
Allogeneic HSCT involves two people: the (healthy) donor and the (patient) recipient. Allogeneic HSC donors must have a tissue ([[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]]) type that matches the recipient. Matching is performed on the basis of variability at three or more [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of the HLA gene, and a perfect match at these loci is preferred. Even if there is a good match at these critical alleles, the recipient will require [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] medications to mitigate [[graft-versus-host disease]]. Allogeneic transplant donors may be ''related'' (usually a closely HLA matched sibling), ''syngeneic'' (a [[monozygotic]] or 'identical' twin of the patient - necessarily extremely rare since few patients have an identical twin, but offering a source of perfectly HLA matched stem cells) or  ''unrelated'' (donor who is not related and found to have  very close degree of HLA matching). Unrelated donors may be found through a registry of bone marrow donors such as the [[National Marrow Donor Program]]. People who would like to be tested for a specific family member or friend without joining any of the bone marrow registry data banks may contact a private HLA testing laboratory and be tested with a mouth swab to see if they are a potential match.<ref>[http://www.bonemarrowtest.com/marrowdonoroptions.htm  "Getting Tested: Bone Marrow Donor Options"]</ref>  A "[[savior sibling]]" may be intentionally selected by [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] in order to match a child both regarding HLA type and being free of any obvious inheritable disorder. Allogeneic transplants are also performed using umbilical [[cord blood]] as the source of stem cells.  In general, by transfusing healthy stem cells to the recipient's bloodstream to reform a healthy immune system, allogeneic HSCTs appear to improve chances for cure or long-term remission once the immediate transplant-related complications are resolved.<ref name="Russell N, Bessell E, Stainer C, Haynes A, Das-Gupta E, Byrne J 2000 837–41">{{cite journal |author=Russell N, Bessell E, Stainer C, Haynes A, Das-Gupta E, Byrne J |title=Allogenic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukaemia using fractionated total body radiation and high-dose melphalan conditioning |journal=[[Acta Oncol]] |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=837–41 |year=2000 |pmid=11145442 |doi= 10.1080/028418600750063596|url=}}</ref><ref name="Nivison-Smith I, Bradstock KF, Dodds AJ, Hawkins PA, Szer J 2005 18–27">{{cite journal |author=Nivison-Smith I, Bradstock KF, Dodds AJ, Hawkins PA, Szer J |title=Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation in Australia and New Zealand, 1992-2001: progress report from the Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry |journal=[[Intern Med J]] |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=18–27 |year=2005 |pmid=15667464 |doi=10.1111/j.1445-5994.2004.00704.x |url=}}</ref><ref>[http://clltopics.org/BMT/OnlyRealCure.htm CLL article]</ref>

A compatible donor is found by doing additional HLA-testing from the blood of potential donors. The HLA genes fall in two categories (Type I and Type II).  In general, mismatches of the Type-I genes (i.e. HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C) increase the risk of graft rejection.  A mismatch of an HLA Type II gene (i.e. HLA-DR, or [[HLA-DQB1]]) increases the risk of graft-versus-host disease.  In addition a genetic mismatch as small as a single [[DNA]] [[base pair]] is significant so perfect matches require knowledge of the exact DNA sequence of these genes for both donor and recipient.  Leading transplant centers currently perform testing for all five of these HLA genes before declaring that a donor and recipient are HLA-identical.

[[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]] and [[ethnicity]] are known to play a major role in donor recruitment drives, as members of the same ethnic group are more likely to have matching genes, including the genes for HLA.&nbsp;[http://www.marrow.org/DONOR/ABCs/index.html]

==Sources and storage of cells==
To limit the risks of transplanted stem cell [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] or of severe [[graft-versus-host disease]] in allogeneic HSCT, the donor should preferably have the same [[human leukocyte antigen|human leukocyte antigens (HLA)]] as the recipient. About 25 to 30 percent of allogeneic HSCT recipients have an HLA-identical sibling. Even so-called "perfect matches" may have mismatched minor alleles that contribute to graft-versus-host disease.

===Bone marrow===
[[Image:Bone marrow biopsy.jpg|thumb|Bone marrow harvest.]]
In the case of a bone marrow transplant, the HSC are removed from a large bone of the donor, typically the [[pelvis]], through a large [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] that reaches the center of the bone. The technique is referred to as a bone marrow harvest and is performed under [[general anesthesia]].

===Peripheral blood stem cells===
{{Main|Peripheral stem cell transplantation}}
Peripheral blood stem cells<ref name="Cutler">{{cite journal |author=Cutler C, Antin JH |title=Peripheral blood stem cells for allogeneic transplantation: a review |journal=[[Stem Cells]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=108–17 |year=2001 |pmid=11239165 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.19-2-108}}</ref> are now the most common source of stem cells for allogeneic HSCT. They are collected from the blood through a process known as [[apheresis]]. The donor's blood is withdrawn through a sterile needle in one arm and passed through a machine that removes [[white blood cells]]. The [[red blood cells]] are returned to the donor. The peripheral stem cell yield is boosted with daily subcutaneous injections of [[Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor]], serving to mobilize stem cells from the donor's bone marrow into the peripheral circulation.

===Amniotic fluid===
It is also possible to extract hematopoietic stem cells from [[amniotic fluid]] for both autologous or heterologous use at the time of childbirth.

===Umbilical cord blood===
Umbilical [[cord blood]] is obtained when a mother donates her infant's [[Umbilical Cord]] and [[Placenta]] after birth.  [[Cord blood]] has a higher concentration of HSC than is normally found in adult blood.  However, the small quantity of blood obtained from an Umbilical Cord (typically about 50 mL) makes it more suitable for transplantation into small children than into adults.  Newer techniques using ex-vivo expansion of cord blood units or the use of two cord blood units from different donors allow cord blood transplants to be used in adults.

Cord blood can be harvested from the Umbilical Cord of a child being born after [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) for [[human leucocyte antigen]] (HLA) matching (see [[PGD for HLA matching]]) in order to donate to an ill sibling requiring HSCT.

===Storage of HSC===
Unlike other organs, bone marrow cells can be frozen (cryopreserved) for prolonged periods without damaging too many cells. This is a necessity with autologous HSC because the cells must be harvested from the recipient months in advance of the transplant treatment. In the case of allogeneic transplants, fresh HSC are preferred in order to avoid cell loss that might occur during the freezing and thawing process. Allogeneic [[cord blood]] is stored frozen at a [[cord blood bank]] because it is only obtainable at the time of [[childbirth]]. To cryopreserve HSC, a preservative, [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], must be added, and the cells must be cooled very slowly in a controlled-rate freezer to prevent [[osmosis|osmotic]] cellular injury during ice crystal formation. HSC may be stored for years in a ''cryofreezer,'' which typically uses [[liquid nitrogen]].

{{anchor|conditioning}}

==Conditioning regimens==

===Myeloablative transplants===
The [[chemotherapy]] or [[irradiation]] given immediately prior to a transplant is called the ''conditioning regimen'', the purpose of which is to help eradicate the patient's disease prior to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be ''ablated'' (destroyed) with dose-levels that cause minimal injury to other tissues. In allogeneic transplants a combination of [[cyclophosphamide]] with [[total body irradiation]] is conventionally employed. This treatment also has an [[immunosuppressive]] effect that prevents rejection of the HSC by the recipient's [[immune system]]. The post-transplant prognosis often includes acute and chronic [[graft-versus-host disease]] that may be life-threatening. However, in certain leukemias this can coincide with protection against cancer relapse owing to the ''graft versus tumor'' effect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Toze CL, Galal A, Barnett MJ, ''et al.'' |title=Myeloablative allografting for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: evidence for a potent graft-versus-leukemia effect associated with graft-versus-host disease |journal=[[Bone Marrow Transplant.]] |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=825–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16151430 |doi=10.1038/sj.bmt.1705130}}</ref> ''Autologous'' transplants may also use similar conditioning regimens, but many other chemotherapy combinations can be used depending on the type of disease.

===Non-myeloablative allogeneic transplants===
This is a newer treatment approach using lower doses of [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation]], which are too low to eradicate all the [[bone marrow cells]] of a recipient. Instead, non-myeloablative transplants run lower risks of serious infections and transplant-related mortality while relying upon the ''graft versus tumor'' effect to resist the inherent increased risk of cancer relapse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alyea EP, Kim HT, Ho V, ''et al.'' |title=Impact of conditioning regimen intensity on outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for advanced acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome |journal=Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant. |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=1047–55 |year=2006 |pmid=17067911 |doi=10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.06.003}}</ref><ref name="Alyea EP, Kim HT, Ho V, et al. 2005 1810–4">{{cite journal |author=Alyea EP, Kim HT, Ho V, ''et al.'' |title=Comparative outcome of nonmyeloablative and myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for patients older than 50 years of age |journal=Blood |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=1810–4 |year=2005 |pmid=15459007 |doi=10.1182/blood-2004-05-1947}}</ref> Also significantly, while requiring high doses of [[immunosuppressive agents]] in the early stages of treatment, these doses are less than for conventional transplants.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mielcarek M, Martin PJ, Leisenring W, ''et al.'' |title=Graft-versus-host disease after nonmyeloablative versus conventional hematopoietic stem cell transplantation |journal=Blood |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=756–62 |year=2003 |pmid=12663454 |doi=10.1182/blood-2002-08-2628}}</ref> This leads to a state of mixed [[chimera (genetics)|chimerism]] early after transplant where both recipient and donor HSC coexist in the bone marrow space.

Decreasing doses of immunosuppressive therapy then allows donor [[T-cell]]s to eradicate the remaining recipient HSC and to induce the graft versus tumor effect. This effect is often accompanied by mild [[graft-versus-host disease]], the appearance of which is often a surrogate marker for the emergence of the desirable graft versus tumor effect, and also serves as a signal to establish an appropriate dosage level for sustained treatment with low levels of [[immunosuppressive agents]].

Because of their gentler conditioning regimens, these transplants are associated with a lower risk of transplant-related mortality and therefore allow patients who are considered too high-risk for conventional allogeneic HSCT to undergo potentially curative therapy for their disease. These new transplant strategies are still somewhat experimental, but are being used more widely on elderly patients unfit for myeloablative regimens and for whom the higher risk of cancer relapse may be acceptable.<ref name="Alyea EP, Kim HT, Ho V, et al. 2005 1810–4"/>

==Engraftment==
After several weeks of growth in the bone marrow, expansion of HSC and their progeny is sufficient to normalize the blood cell counts and reinitiate the [[immune system]]. The offspring of donor-derived [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s have been documented to populate many different organs of the recipient, including the [[heart]], [[liver]], and [[muscle]], and these cells had been suggested to have the abilities of regenerating injured tissue in these organs.  However, recent research has shown that such lineage infidelity does not occur as a normal phenomenon {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.

==Complications==
HSCT is associated with a high treatment-related mortality in the recipient (10% or higher){{Citation needed|reason=please state where this information comes from|date=November 2011}}, which limits its use to conditions that are themselves life-threatening. Major complications are [[veno-occlusive disease]], [[mucositis]], infections ([[sepsis]]), [[graft-versus-host disease]] and the development of new [[cancer|malignancies]].

=== Infection ===
Bone marrow transplantation usually requires that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed ("myeloablation"). Prior to "engraftment" patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of [[white blood cells]] to help fight [[infection]]. This puts a patient at high risk of infections, [[sepsis]] and [[septic shock]], despite [[prophylactic]] [[antibiotic]]s. However, [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] [[medication]]s, such as [[acyclovir]] and [[valacyclovir]], are quite effective in prevention of HSCT-related outbreak of [[herpes simplex|herpetic]] infection in [[Serostatus|seropositive]] patients.<ref name="HSV">{{cite journal |author=Elad S, Zadik Y, Hewson I, ''et al.'' |title=A systematic review of viral infections associated with oral involvement in cancer patients: a spotlight on Herpesviridea |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=993–1006 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20544224 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g476114717852h80/ |doi=10.1007/s00520-010-0900-3}}</ref> The [[immunosuppressive agents]] employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of [[opportunistic infection]]. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their [[immune system|acquired immunity]], for example immunity to childhood diseases such as [[measles]] or [[poliomyelitis|polio]]. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood [[vaccines]] once they are off immunosuppressive medications.

=== Veno-occlusive disease ===
Severe liver injury can result from hepatic [[veno-occlusive disease]] (VOD). Elevated levels of [[bilirubin]], [[hepatomegaly]] and fluid retention are clinical hallmarks of this condition. There is now a greater appreciation of the generalized cellular injury and obstruction in hepatic vein sinuses, and hepatic VOD has lately been referred to as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). Severe cases of SOS are associated with a high mortality rate. [[Anticoagulant]]s or [[defibrotide]] may be effective in reducing the severity of VOD but may also increase bleeding complications. [[Ursodiol]] has been shown to help prevent VOD, presumably by facilitating the flow of [[bile]].

===Mucositis===
The injury of the mucosal lining of the mouth and throat is a common regimen-related toxicity following ablative HSCT regimens. It is usually not life-threatening but is very painful, and prevents eating and drinking. Mucositis is treated with pain medications plus intravenous infusions to prevent dehydration and malnutrition.

===Graft-versus-host disease===
{{Main|Graft-versus-host disease}}
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an inflammatory disease that is peculiar to allogeneic transplantation. It is an attack of the "new" bone marrow's immune cells against the recipient's tissues. This can occur even if the donor and recipient are HLA-identical because the immune system can still recognize other differences between their tissues. It is aptly named graft-versus-host disease because bone marrow transplantation is the only transplant procedure in which the transplanted cells must accept the body rather than the body accepting the new cells.
''Acute graft-versus-host disease'' typically occurs in the first 3 months after transplantation and may involve the [[skin]], [[intestine]], or the [[liver]]. High-dose [[corticosteroids]] such as [[prednisone]] are a standard treatment; however this immuno-suppressive treatment often leads to deadly infections.
''Chronic graft-versus-host disease'' may also develop after allogeneic transplant. It is the major source of late treatment-related complications, although it less often results in death. In addition to inflammation, chronic graft-versus-host disease may lead to the development of [[fibrosis]], or scar tissue, similar to [[scleroderma]]; it may cause functional disability and require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.
Graft-versus-host disease is usually mediated by [[T cells]], which react to foreign peptides presented on the [[MHC]] of the host{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.

===Graft-versus-tumor effect===
Graft-versus-tumor effect (GVT) or "graft versus leukemia" effect is the beneficial aspect of the Graft-versus-Host phenomenon. For example, HSCT patients with either acute and in particular chronic graft-versus-host disease after an allogeneic transplant tend to have a lower risk of cancer relapse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baron F, Maris MB, Sandmaier BM, ''et al.'' |title=Graft-versus-tumor effects after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with nonmyeloablative conditioning |journal=J.

This lower rate of relapse accounts for the increased success rate of allogeneic transplants, compared to transplants from identical twins, and indicates that allogeneic HSCT is a form of immunotherapy. GVT is the major benefit of transplants that do not employ the highest immuno-suppressive regimens.

Graft versus tumor is mainly beneficial in diseases with slow progress, e.g. chronic leukemia, low-grade lymphoma, and some cases multiple myeloma. However, it is less effective in rapidly growing acute leukemias.<ref name=Kettering>[http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/15927.cfm Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center > Blood & Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation > The Graft-versus-Tumor Effect] Last Updated: Nov. 20, 2003.

If cancer relapses after HSCT, another transplant can be performed, infusing the patient with a greater quantity of donor white blood cells.<ref name=Kettering/>

===Oral carcinoma===
Patients after HSCT are at a higher risk for [[mouth|oral]] [[squamous cell carcinoma|carcinoma]]. Post-HSCT [[oral cancer]] may have more aggressive behavior with poorer prognosis, when compared to oral cancer in non-HSCT patients.<ref name="Oral">{{cite journal |author=Elad S, Zadik Y, Zeevi I, ''et al.'' |title=Oral cancer in patients after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation: long-term follow-up suggests an increased risk for recurrence |journal=Transplantation |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=1243–4 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21119507 |doi=10.1097/TP.0b013e3181f9caaa}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Prognosis in HSCT varies widely dependent upon disease type, stage, stem cell source, HLA-matched status (for allogeneic HCST) and conditioning regimen. A transplant offers a chance for cure or long-term remission if the inherent complications of graft versus host disease, immuno-suppressive treatments and the spectrum of opportunistic infections can be survived.<ref name="Russell N, Bessell E, Stainer C, Haynes A, Das-Gupta E, Byrne J 2000 837–41"/><ref name="Nivison-Smith I, Bradstock KF, Dodds AJ, Hawkins PA, Szer J 2005 18–27"/> In recent years, survival rates have been gradually improving across almost all populations and sub-populations receiving transplants.<ref>[https://campus.mcw.edu/AngelUploads/Content/CS_IBMTR2/_assoc/ECCBED0AF0A4492BB667FB6227DC7C06/SummarySet06_Pt2_files/frame.htm Data analysis slides by Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research]</ref>

Mortality for allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be estimated using the prediction model created by Sorror et al.,<ref name="pmid15994282">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1182/blood-2005-05-2004 | author = Sorror  ''et al.'' | year = 2005 | title = Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)-specific comorbidity index: a new tool for risk assessment before allogeneic HCT | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 106 | issue = 8| pages = 2912–2919 | pmid = 15994282 | pmc = 1895304 }}</ref> using the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI). The HCT-CI was derived and validated by investigators at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, WA). The HCT-CI modifies and adds to a well-validated comorbidity index, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (Charlson et al.<ref name="pmid3558716">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0021-9681(87)90171-8 | author = Charlson  ''et al.'' | year = 1987 | title = A new method of classifying prognostic comorbidity in longitudinal studies: development and validation | url = | journal = J Chronic Dis. | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 373–38 }}</ref>) The CCI was previously applied to patients undergoing allogeneic HCT but appears to provide less survival prediction and discrimination than the HCT-CI scoring system.

==Risks to donor==
The risks of a complication depend on patient characteristics, health care providers and the [[apheresis]] procedure, and the colony-stimulating factor used ([[G-CSF]], [[GM-CSF]]). G-CSF drugs include [[filgrastim]] (Neupogen, Neulasta), and [[lenograstim]] (Graslopin).

===Drug risks===
Filgrastim is typically dosed in the 10 microgram/kg level for 4–5 days during the harvesting of stem cells. The documented adverse effects of filgrastim include [[splenic rupture]] (indicated by left upper abdominal or shoulder pain, risk 1 in 40000), Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alveolar hemorrage, and allergic reactions (usually expressed in first 30 minutes, risk 1 in 300).<ref name="AmgenRx">Neupogen Prescription information provided by Amgen http://pi.amgen.com/united_states/neupogen/neupogen_pi_hcp_english.pdf</ref><ref name="Donor-Risk1"/><ref name="Donor-Risk3"/> In addition, platelet and hemoglobin levels dip post-procedure, not returning to normal until one month.<ref name="Donor-Risk3"/>

The question of whether geriatrics (patients over 65) react the same as patients under 65 has not been sufficiently examined.  Coagulation issues and inflammation of atherosclerotic plaques are known to occur as a result of G-CSF injection.<ref name="Donor-Risk1">{{cite journal |doi=10.3324/haematol.13668 |author=Halter J,Kodera Y,Urbano-Ipizua A, Greinix HT, Schmitz N, Favre G,Baldomero H, Niederwieser D,Apperley JF, and Gratwohl A |title=Severe events in donors after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell donation |journal=[[Haematologica]] |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=94–101 |year=2009 |pmid=19059940 |pmc=2625420}}</ref> G-CSF has also been described to induce genetic changes in mononuclear cells of normal donors.<ref name="Donor-Risk1"/> There is evidence that myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) can be induced by GCSF in susceptible individuals.<ref name="Donor-Risk2"/>

===Access risks===
Blood was drawn peripherally in a majority of patients, but a central line to jugular/subclavian/femoral veins may be used in 16% of women and 4% of men. Adverse reactions during [[apheresis]] were experienced in 20% of women and 8% of men, these adverse events primarily consisted of numbness/tingling, multiple line attempts, and nausea.<ref name="Donor-Risk3"/>

===Clinical observations===
A study involving 2408 donors (18–60 years) indicated that bone pain (primarily back and hips) as a result of filgrastim treatment is observed in 80% of donors by day 4 post-injection.<ref name="Donor-Risk3">{{cite journal |doi=10.1182/blood-2008-08-175323 |author=Pulsipher MA,Chitphakdithai P, Miller JP, Logan BR, King RJ,Rizzo JR, Leitman SR, Anderlini P, Haagenson MD,Kurian S, Klein JP,  Horowitz MM, and Confer DL |title=Adverse events among 2408 unrelated donors of peripheral blood stem cells: results of a prospective trial from the National Marrow Donor Program |journal=[[Blood (journal)|Blood]] | volume=113|issue=19|pages=3604–3611|year=2009 |pmid=19190248 |pmc=2668845}}</ref> This pain responded to acetaminophen or ibuprofen in 65% of donors and was characterized as mild to moderate in 80% of donors and severe in 10%.<ref name="Donor-Risk3"/> Bone pain receded post-donation to 26% of patients 2 days post-donation, 6% of patients one week post-donation, and <2% 1 year post-donation. Donation is not recommended for those with a history of back pain.<ref name="Donor-Risk3"/> Other symptoms observed in more than 40% of donors include myalgia, headache, fatigue, and insomnia.<ref name="Donor-Risk3"/> These symptoms all returned to baseline 1 month post-donation, except for some cases of persistent fatigue in 3% of donors.<ref name="Donor-Risk3"/>
.
In one metastudy that incorporated data from 377 donors, 44% of patients reported having adverse side effects after peripheral blood HSCT.<ref name="Donor-Risk2">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07832.x |author=Pamphilon D,Siddiq S, Brunskill S,Dore´e C,Hyde C,Horowitz M, and Stanworth S |title=Stem cell donation – What advice can be given to the donor? |journal=[[British Journal of Haematology]] |volume=147 |issue=1|pages=71–76 |year=2009 |pmid=19681886 |pmc=3409390}}</ref> Side effects included pain prior to the collection procedure as a result of GCSF injections, post-procedural generalized skeletal pain, fatigue and reduced energy.<ref name="Donor-Risk2"/>

===Severe reactions===
A study that surveyed 2408 donors found that serious adverse events (requiring prolonged hospitalization) occurred in 15 donors (at a rate of 0.6%), although none of these events were fatal.<ref name="Donor-Risk3"/> Donors were not observed to have higher than normal rates of cancer with up to 4–8 years of follow up.<ref name="Donor-Risk3"/>
One study based on a survey of medical teams covered approximately 24,000 peripheral blood HSCT cases between 1993 and 2005, and found a serious cardiovascular adverse reaction rate of about 1 in 1500.<ref name="Donor-Risk1"/> This study reported a cardiovascular-related fatality risk within the first 30 days HSCT of about 2 in 10000. For this same group, severe cardiovascular events were observed with a rate of about 1 in 1500. The most common severe adverse reactions were pulmonary edema/deep vein thrombosis, splenic rupture, and myocardial infarction. Haematological malignancy induction was comparable to that observed in the general population, with only 15 reported cases within 4 years.<ref name="Donor-Risk1"/>

==Donor registration and recruitment==

At the end of 2010, 14.9 million people had registered their willingness to be a bone marrow donor with one of the 64 registries from 45 countries participating in [[Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide]].  12.2 million of these registered donors had been ABDR typed, allowing easy matching.  A further 453,000 cord blood units had been received by one of 44 cord blood units from 26 countries participating.  The highest total number of bone marrow donors registered were those from the USA (6.4 million), and the highest number per capita were those from Cyprus (10.6% of the population).<ref name="BMDW2010">Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide Annual Report 2010 http://bmdw.org/uploads/media/BMDW2010_01.pdf</ref>

Within the United States, racial minority groups are the least likely to be registered and therefore the least likely to find a potentially life-saving match.  In 1990, only six African-Americans were able to find a bone marrow match, and all six had common European genetic signatures.<ref name=McNeil>{{cite news

Africans are more genetically diverse than people of European descent, which means that more registrations are needed to find a match.<ref name=McNeil />  Bone marrow and cord blood banks exist in [[South Africa]], and a new program is beginning in [[Nigeria]].<ref name=McNeil/>

==Research==
=== HIV ===
In 2007, a team of doctors in Berlin, Germany, including [[Gero Hütter]], performed a stem cell transplant for [[Acute myeloid leukemia|leukemia]] patient Timothy Ray Brown, who was also [[HIV]]-positive.<ref name=ghivberlin>{{cite news|title=German HIV patient cured after stem cell transplant|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/german-hiv-patient-cured-after-stem-cell-transplant-15030473.html|accessdate=December 15, 2010|newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=December 15, 2010}}</ref> From 60 [[Human leukocyte antigen|matching]] donors, they selected a [[CCR5|[CCR5]-Δ32 homozygous]] individual with two [[Allele|genetic copies]] of a rare variant of a cell surface receptor. This genetic trait confers resistance to HIV infection by blocking attachment of HIV to the cell. Roughly one in 1000 people of European ancestry have this inherited mutation, but it is rarer in other populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7726118.stm|title=Bone marrow 'cures HIV patient'|date=2008-11-13|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref><ref>http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030339</ref> The transplant was repeated a year later after a relapse.

In 2012, Daniel Kuritzkes reported results of two stem cell transplants in patients with HIV.  They did not, however, use donors with the Δ32 deletion.  One of the men has been followed for two years and the other for three and a half years. While both are still on HIV treatment, neither shows traces of HIV in their blood plasma and purified CD4 T cells using a sensitive culture method (less than 3 copies/ml). They are also showing a significant decline in HIV antibodies, suggesting a lack of HIV replication.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Infect Dis |date=2013 Mar 4 |title=Long-term reduction in peripheral blood HIV-1 reservoirs following reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation |author=Henrich TJ, Hu Z, Li JZ, Sciaranghella G, Busch MP, Keating SM, Gallien S, Lin NH, Giguel FF, Lavoie L, Ho VT, Armand P, Soiffer RJ, Sagar M, Lacasce AS, Kuritzkes DR |pmid=23460751 |doi=10.1093/infdis/jit086 }} (primary source)</ref>{{vn|date=April 2013}}

===Multiple sclerosis===
