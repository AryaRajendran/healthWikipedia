A '''saviour sibling''' (or '''savior sibling''') is a child who is born to provide an organ or cell transplant to a sibling that is affected with a fatal disease, such as [[cancer]] or [[Fanconi anemia]], that can best be treated by [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]]. 

The savior sibling is conceived through [[in vitro fertilization]]. Fertilized [[zygotes]] are tested for genetic compatibility ([[human leucocyte antigen]] (HLA) typing), using [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD), and only zygotes that are compatible with the existing child are implanted. Zygotes are also tested to make sure they are free of the original genetic disease. The procedure is controversial.<ref name="Crystal"/><ref>{{cite journal |pages=167–75 |doi=10.1080/13691050902914110 |title=Choosing offspring: Prenatal genetic testing for thalassaemia and the production of a 'saviour sibling' in China |year=2010 |last1=Sui |first1=Suli |last2=Sleeboom-Faulkner |first2=Margaret |journal=Culture, Health & Sexuality |volume=12 |issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17058348 |year=2005 |last1=Bennett |first1=B |title=Symbiotic relationships: Saviour siblings, family rights and biomedicine |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=195–212 |journal=Australian journal of family law}}</ref>

==Indications==
A ''savior sibling'' may be the solution for any disease requiring [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] (see ''[[Bone marrow transplant#Conditions treated with bone marrow or HSC transplantation|Conditions treated with bone marrow transplantation]]''). It is effective against genetically detectable (mostly [[monogenic disease|monogenic]]) diseases, e.g. [[Fanconi anemia]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Moore, Pete |title=The Debate About Genetic Engineering (Ethical Debates) |publisher=Rosen Central |location=New York, NY |year=2007 |page=29 |isbn=1-4042-3754-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> [[Diamond-Blackfan anemia]]<ref name=wwn>[http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-sav1.htm SAVIOUR SIBLING] worldwidewords.org. Page created 11 Aug. 2007</ref> and [[β-thalassemia]], in the ailing sibling, since the savior sibling can be selected to not have inherited the disease. The procedure may also be used in children with [[leukemia]], and in such cases HLA match is the only requirement, and not exclusion of any other obvious genetic disorder. 
==Procedure==

{{See|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis}}
Multiple embryos are created and [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] is used to detect and select ones that are free of a [[genetic disorder]] and that are also a HLA match for an existing sibling who requires a transplant. Upon birth, umbilical [[cord blood]] is taken and used for [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]].

==Laws==
* In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] (HFEA) has ruled that it is lawful to use modern reproductive techniques to create a savior sibling.<ref name=wwn/>
*In Victoria, [[Australia]], use of PGD for HLA typing is reviewed by the [[Infertility Treatment Authority]] on a case-by-case basis.<ref name=Crystal>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11673-007-9034-9 |title='Saviour Siblings'? The Distinction between PGD with HLA Tissue Typing and Preimplantation HLA Tissue Typing |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=Crystal K. |journal=Journal of Bioethical Inquiry |volume=4 |pages=65}}</ref>

==Ethical considerations==
Arguments for or against the use of PGD/HLA tissue typing are based on several key issues including the commodification and welfare of the donor child.<ref name=Crystal/>

The main ethical argument against is the possible exploitation of the child, e.g. potential adverse psychological effects on a child born not for itself but to save another.<ref name=wwn/> 

A survey of 4,000 Americans showed that 61% approved of PGD use for savior siblings.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7899.php Genetic testing of embryos to pick 'savior sibling' OK with most Americans] medicalnewstoday.com, Article Date: 04 May 2004 - 0:00 PDT</ref>

==History==
[[Yury Verlinsky]] and collaborators described the first case in 2001.<ref name="test">[http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/285/24/3130.full "Preimplantation Diagnosis for Fanconi Anemia Combined With HLA Matching"], Yury Verlinsky et al. The Journal of the American Medical Association.</ref>

==Popular Culture==
The novel ''[[My Sister's Keeper (novel)|My Sister's Keeper]]'', later adapted into [[My Sister's Keeper (film)|a film]] is about a child who was born as a savior sibling.
