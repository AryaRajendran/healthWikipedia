'''Barotrauma''' is physical damage to body tissues caused by a difference in [[pressure]] between a gas space inside, or in contact with the body, and the surrounding [[fluid]].<ref name=usn>{{cite book |title=US Navy Diving Manual, 6th revision |year=2006 |publisher=US Naval Sea Systems Command |location=United States |url=http://www.supsalv.org/00c3_publications.asp?destPage=00c3&pageID=3.9 |accessdate=2008-05-26 }}</ref><ref name=Brubakk>{{cite book |title=Bennett and Elliott's physiology and medicine of diving, 5th Rev ed. |last=Brubakk |first=A.

Barotrauma typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a significant change in ambient pressure, such as when a [[Scuba diving|scuba diver]], a [[free-diving|free-diver]] or an airplane passenger ascends or descends, or during [[uncontrolled decompression]] of a [[pressure vessel]], but can also be caused by a [[shock wave]].

== Diving barotrauma ==
===Ear barotrauma===
Barotrauma can affect the external, middle, or inner ear.  Middle ear barotrauma (MEBT) is the most common being experienced by between 10% and 30% of divers and is due to insufficient [[Ear clearing|equilibration of the middle ear]].  External ear barotrauma may occur on ascent if high pressure air is trapped in the [[external auditory canal]] either by tight fitting diving equipment or ear wax.  Inner ear barotrauma (IEBT) though much less common than MEBT shares a similar mechanism.  Mechanical trauma to the inner ear can lead to varying degrees of [[conductive hearing loss|conductive]] and [[sensorineural hearing loss]] as well as [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=1906 |url= }}</ref>

===Barosinusitis===
The [[sinuses]] similar to other air filled cavities are susceptible to barotrauma if their openings become obstructed.  This can result in pain as well as [[epistaxis]].<ref name="Marx 2010 1907">{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=1907 |url= }}</ref>

===Mask squeeze===
If a diver's mask is not equalized during descent the relative negative pressure can produce [[petechial hemorrhage]]s in the area covered by the mask along with [[subconjunctival hemorrhage]]s.<ref name="Marx 2010 1907"/>

===Pulmonary barotrauma===
Pulmonary (lung) pressure damage in scuba divers is usually caused by breath-holding on ascent.  The compressed gas in the lungs expands as the ambient pressure decreases causing the lungs to over expand and rupture unless the diver breathes out. The lungs do not sense pain when over-expanded giving the diver little warning to prevent the injury.  This does not affect breath-hold skin divers as they bring a lungfull of air with them from the surface, which merely re-expands safely to near its original volume on ascent.  The problem only arises if a breath of compressed gas is taken at depth, which will then expand on ascent to more than the lung volume.  Pulmonary barotrauma may also be caused by [[explosive decompression]] of a pressurised aircraft.

===Causes===

====Diving barotraumas====
When diving, the [[pressure]] differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure:
There are two components to the surrounding pressure acting on the diver: the [[atmospheric pressure]] and the water pressure. A descent of 10 metres (33&nbsp;feet) in water increases the ambient pressure by an amount approximately equal to the pressure of the atmosphere at sea level. So, a descent from the surface to 10 metres (33&nbsp;feet) underwater results in a doubling of the pressure on the diver. This pressure change will reduce the volume of a gas filled space by half. [[Boyle's law]] describes the relationship between the [[volume]] of the gas space and the [[pressure]] in the gas.

Barotraumas of descent are caused by preventing the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver, resulting in a pressure difference between the tissues and the gas space, and the unbalanced force due to this pressure difference causes deformation of the tissues resulting in cell rupture.

Barotraumas of ascent are also caused when the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver is prevented. In this case the pressure difference causes a resultant tension in the surrounding tissues which exceeds their tensile strength. Besides tissue rupture, the overpressure may cause ingress of gases into the tissues and further afield through venous blood vessels.

Breathing gas at depth from [[Scuba set|underwater breathing equipment]] results in the lungs containing gas at a higher pressure than atmospheric pressure. So a [[free-diving]] diver can dive to 10 metres (33&nbsp;feet) and safely ascend without exhaling, because the gas in the lungs had been inhaled at atmospheric pressure, whereas a [[Underwater diving|diver]] who breathes at 10 metres and ascends without exhaling has lungs containing twice the amount of gas at atmospheric pressure and is very likely to suffer life-threatening lung damage.

===Avoidance and treatment===
Diving barotrauma can be avoided by eliminating any pressure differences acting on the tissue or organ by ''equalizing'' the pressure. There are a variety of techniques:

*The air spaces in the '''[[ear]]s''', and the [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]]. The risk is '''burst [[eardrum]]'''. Here, the diver can use a [[Ear clearing|variety of methods]], to let air into the [[middle ear]]s via the [[Eustachian tube]]s. Sometimes swallowing will open the Eustachian tubes and equalise the ears.
*The '''[[human lung|lung]]s'''. The risk includes [[pneumothorax]], [[arterial gas embolism]], and [[Mediastinal emphysema|mediastinal]] and [[Subcutaneous emphysema|subcutanous emphysemas]]. which are commonly called '''burst lung''' or '''lung overpressure injury''' by divers. To equalise, all that is necessary is not to hold the breath during ascent. This risk does not arise when snorkel diving from the surface, unless the snorkeller breathes from a high pressure gas source underwater, or from submerged air pockets. Some people have pathologies of the lung which prevent rapid flow of excess air though the passages, which can lead to lung barotrauma even if the breath is not held during rapid depressurisation. These people should not dive as the risk is unacceptably high. Most commercial or military diving medical examinations will look specifically for signs of this pathology.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*The air inside the usual eyes-and-nose '''[[diving mask]]''' (also known as a half mask). The main risk is bleeding around the eyes from the negative pressure<ref name=mask/> or orbital emphysema from higher pressures.<ref name="pmid18619111">{{cite journal |author=Bolognini A, Delehaye E, Cau M, Cosso L |title=Barotraumatic orbital emphysema of rhinogenic origin in a breath-hold diver: a case report |journal=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=163–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18619111 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/8090 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref> Here, let air into the mask through the nose. Do not dive in eyes-only [[goggles]] as sometimes seen on land with [[SCBA|industrial breathing sets]].
*Air spaces inside a '''[[diving suit|dry suit]]'''. The main risk is folds of skin getting pinched inside folds of the drysuit. Most modern drysuits have a tube connection to feed air in from the cylinder. Air must be injected on the descent and vented on the ascent.

Following barotrauma of the ears or lungs from diving the diver should not dive again until thoroughly cleared by a doctor, which can take many months. <ref ="AHRF">[http://american-hearing.org/disorders/barotrauma/#affect Life effects of Barotrauma at the American Hearing Research Foundation]</ref>

'''Use of a hyperbaric chamber.''' Patients undergoing [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] must learn to equalize in order to avoid barotrauma.<ref name=SPUMS2003barotrauma>{{cite journal |author=Lehm Jan P, Bennett Michael H |title=Predictors of middle ear barotrauma associated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |year=2003 |volume=33 |pages=127–133 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/8076 |accessdate=2009-07-15 }}</ref> Some patients may be at greater risk of otic barotrauma than others.<ref name=SPUMS2003barotrauma/>

==Blast induced barotrauma==
An [[Explosion|explosive blast]] and [[uncontrolled decompression|explosive decompression]] create a [[pressure wave]] that can induce barotrauma.  The difference in pressure between internal organs and the outer surface of the body causes injuries to internal organs that contain gas, such as the [[human lung|lung]]s, [[gastrointestinal tract]], and [[ear]].<ref>{{cite journal | last =Torkki | first =Markus | coauthors =Virve Koljonen, Kirsi Sillanpää1, Erkki Tukiainen, Sari Pyörälä, Esko Kemppainen, Juha Kalske, Eero Arajärvi, Ulla Keränen, Eero Hirvensalo | title =Triage in a Bomb Disaster with 166 Casualties | journal =European Journal of Trauma | volume = 32 | issue =4 | pages =374–80 | month =August | year =2006 | doi =10.1007/s00068-006-6039-8}}</ref>  

Lung injuries can also occur during [[uncontrolled decompression|rapid decompression]], although the risk of injury is lower than with explosive decompression.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3hMZAAAAIAAJ|title=The New Frontier: Man's Survival in the Sky|author=Kenneth Gabriel Williams|year=1959|accessdate=2008-07-28|publisher=Thomas}}</ref><ref name="pmid1599378">{{cite journal |author=Bason R, Yacavone DW |title=Loss of cabin pressurization in U.S. Naval aircraft: 1969-90 |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=341–5 |year=1992 |month=May |pmid=1599378 |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>

==Ventilator induced barotrauma==
[[Mechanical ventilation]] can lead to barotrauma of the lungs. This can be due to either:
*absolute pressures used in order to [[ventilate]] [[Compliance (physiology)|non-compliant]] lungs.
*shearing forces, particularly associated with rapid changes in gas [[velocity]].
The resultant [[alveolus|alveolar]] rupture can lead to [[pneumothorax]], [[pulmonary interstitial emphysema]] (PIE) and [[pneumomediastinum]].

===Swim bladder overexpansion===
Fish with isolated [[swim bladder]]s are susceptible to barotrauma of ascent when brought to the surface by fishing. The swim bladder is an organ of buoyancy control which is filled with gas from the blood, and which is normally removed by the reverse process. If the fish is brought upwards in the water column faster than the gas can be resorbed, the gas will expand until the bladder is stretched to its elastic limit, and may rupture.
Barotrauma could be fatal, but rockfish are able to recover if they are sent back to depths of about 45 meters, shortly after surfacing. Scientists at NOAA developed the Seaqualizer to quickly return rockfish to depth. The device could increase survival in caught-and-released rockfish.  <ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6107/600.full]</ref>
