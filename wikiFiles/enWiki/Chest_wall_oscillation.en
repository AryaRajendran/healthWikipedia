The "Vest Airway Clearance System", a form of '''chest wall oscillation''', is a device and system for clearing excess mucus from lung airways ([[bronchi]] and [[bronchiole]]s). It is principally used in the treatment of [[cystic fibrosis]], but is gaining use in the treatment of other diseases, such as [[bronchiectasis]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], [[cerebral palsy]] and [[muscular dystrophy]], in which excessive mucus can block airways due to excessive production or impaired clearance.

This "passive system" is not dependent on the effort of the patient. It uses a compressor to inflate and deflate the vest rhythmically at timed intervals and thus imposes high frequency chest wall oscillations that are transferred to the lungs. These oscillations thin [[thixotropy|thixotropic]] airway [[mucus]], facilitating its removal by [[cough]]ing. Delivery of air to the vest can be controlled manually.

==History==

The Vest System was developed by Dr. [[Warren Warwick]], a pediatrician and cystic fibrosis expert at the University of Minnesota, which licensed the product to American Biosystems in 1988.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4DD1F3FF935A35757C0A963958260&pagewanted=all When 'Amazing' Is No Longer Enough].
