'''Prolonged grief disorder (PGD)''' refers to a syndrome consisting of a distinct set of symptoms following the death of a loved one that are so prolonged and intense that they exceed the expectably wide range of individual and cultural variability. PGD is relatively rare – experienced by about 10 percent of bereaved survivors, though rates vary depending on the circumstances. This is grief that does not resolve naturally and persists into the indefinite future as a defining feature that severely adversely affects the life of the survivor. The affected person is incapacitated by grief, so focused on the loss that it is difficult to care about much else. S/he ruminates about the death and longs for a reunion with the departed, feeling unsure of his/her identity and place in the world. His/her life is flat and dull, offering little meaning or purpose, and the future holds no prospect of joy, satisfaction or pleasure. The bereaved person who suffers from PGD feels devalued and in constant turmoil, with an inability to adjust to (if not a frank protest against) life without the beloved.

PGD is defined by its symptoms, duration and intensity. The symptoms are yearning intensely for the person, identity confusion, difficulty accepting the loss, bitterness, emotional numbness, inability to trust others and feeling stuck in grief. These are present every day, cause significant distress and functional impairment and remain intense, frequent and disabling for six months or more after the death.<ref name="one"> Frances, A.

==Description==

[[Grief]] is a normal response to bereavement. Researchers have found that 10-12% of people experience a prolonged response to bereavement that impacts functioning and has adverse long-term effects on health.<ref name="two">{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000121 |title=Prolonged Grief Disorder: Psychometric Validation of Criteria Proposed for DSM-V and ICD-11 |year=2009 |editor1-last=Brayne |editor1-first=Carol |last1=Prigerson |first1=Holly G. |last2=Horowitz |first2=Mardi J. |last3=Jacobs |first3=Selby C. |last4=Parkes |first4=Colin M. |last5=Aslan |first5=Mihaela |last6=Goodkin |first6=Karl |last7=Raphael |first7=Beverley |last8=Marwit |first8=Samuel J. |last9=Wortman |first9=Camille |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=e1000121 |pmid=19652695 |pmc=2711304}}</ref><ref name="three">{{cite book |first1=Holly G. |last1=Prigerson |first2=Lauren C. |last2=Vanderwerker |first3=Paul K. |last3=Maciejewski |chapter=A case for inclusion of prolonged grief disorder in DSM-5 |editor1-first=Margaret S. |editor1-last=Stroebe |editor2-first=Robert O. |editor2-last=Hansson |editor3-first=Henk |editor3-last=Schut |editor4-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Stroebe |title=Handbook of Bereavement Research and Practice: Advances in Theory and intervention |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=2008 |pages=165–86 |isbn=978-1-4338-0351-2}}</ref>

Prolonged grief is considered when an individual’s ability to function and level of distress over the loss is extreme and persistent. People with PGD feel "stuck" in their grief, a chronic aching and yearning for a cherished person who is now gone, feel that they are not the same person anymore (e.g., unsure of their identity, loss of a sense of self and self-worth), feel emotionally disconnected from others, and lack the desire to "move on" (and sometimes feeling that doing so would be a betrayal of the person who is now gone).<ref name="four">{{cite journal |pmid=7802116 |year=1995 |last1=Prigerson |first1=HG |last2=Frank |first2=E |last3=Kasl |first3=SV |last4=Reynolds |first4=CF |last5=Anderson |first5=B |last6=Zubenko |first6=GS |last7=Houck |first7=PR |last8=George |first8=CJ |last9=Kupfer |first9=DJ |title=Complicated grief and bereavement-related depression as distinct disorders: Preliminary empirical validation in elderly bereaved spouses |volume=152 |issue=1 |pages=22–30 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry}}</ref><ref name="five">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0165-1781(95)02757-2 |title=Inventory of complicated grief: A scale to measure maladaptive symptoms of loss |year=1995 |last1=Prigerson |first1=Holly G. |last2=MacIejewski |first2=Paul K. |last3=Reynolds |first3=Charles F. |last4=Bierhals |first4=Andrew J. |last5=Newsom |first5=Jason T. |last6=Fasiczka |first6=Amy |last7=Frank |first7=Ellen |last8=Doman |first8=Jack |last9=Miller |first9=Mark |journal=Psychiatry Research |volume=59 |pages=65–79 |pmid=8771222 |issue=1–2}}</ref><ref name="six">{{cite journal |pmid=8890686 |year=1996 |last1=Prigerson |first1=HG |last2=Bierhals |first2=AJ |last3=Kasl |first3=SV |last4=Reynolds |first4=CF |last5=Shear |first5=MK |last6=Newsom |first6=JT |last7=Jacobs |first7=S |title=Complicated grief as a disorder distinct from bereavement-related depression and anxiety: A replication study |volume=153 |issue=11 |pages=1484–6 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry}}</ref><ref name="seven">{{cite journal |pmid=9137115 |year=1997 |last1=Prigerson |first1=HG |last2=Bierhals |first2=AJ |last3=Kasl |first3=SV |last4=Reynolds |first4=CF |last5=Shear |first5=MK |last6=Day |first6=N |last7=Beery |first7=LC |last8=Newsom |first8=JT |last9=Jacobs |first9=S |title=Traumatic grief as a risk factor for mental and physical morbidity |volume=154 |issue=5 |pages=616–23 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry}}</ref><ref name="eight">{{cite journal |pmid=10588419 |year=1999 |last1=Prigerson |first1=HG |last2=Bridge |first2=J |last3=MacIejewski |first3=PK |last4=Beery |first4=LC |last5=Rosenheck |first5=RA |last6=Jacobs |first6=SC |last7=Bierhals |first7=AJ |last8=Kupfer |first8=DJ |last9=Brent |first9=DA |title=Influence of traumatic grief on suicidal ideation among young adults |volume=156 |issue=12 |pages=1994–5 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry}}</ref><ref name="nine">{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.174.1.67 |title=Consensus criteria for traumatic grief.

===What is the difference between normal grief and "Prolonged Grief Disorder" (PGD)?===

Although extremely painful, grief is the normal process of accommodating to a new life without the deceased loved one. Most bereaved survivors manage to get through the worst of their grief and continue to function and find meaning in life. Normal grief differs from PGD in that it is not as intense, persistent, disabling and life-altering and is not experienced as a severe threat to the survivor's identity, sense of self-worth, feeling of security, safety or hopes for future happiness. Although normal grief remains with the bereaved person far into the future, its ability to disrupt the survivor's life dissipates with time.<ref name="one" />

Recognizing prolonged grief as a disorder would allow it to be better understood, detected, studied and treated. Insurance companies would also be more likely reimburse its care. On the other hand, inclusion of PGD in the DSM-5 and ICD-11 may be misunderstood as the [[medicalization]] of grief, reducing its dignity, turning love into pathology and implying that survivors should quickly forget and "get over" the loss. Bereaved persons may be insulted by having their distress labeled as a mental disorder. While this [[stigmatization]] would not be the intent, it might be an unintended consequence. In spite of this concern, studies have show that of nearly all bereaved individuals who met the criteria for PGD were receptive to treatment and their families relieved to know they had a recognizable syndrome.<ref name="fortythree">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07481180903070392 |title=Stigmatization and Receptivity to Mental Health Services Among Recently Bereaved Adults |year=2009 |last1=Johnson |first1=Jeffrey G. |last2=First |first2=Michael B. |last3=Block |first3=Susan |last4=Vanderwerker |first4=Lauren C. |last5=Zivin |first5=Kara |last6=Zhang |first6=Baohui |last7=Prigerson |first7=Holly G. |journal=Death Studies |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=691–711 |pmid=19697482 |pmc=2834798}}</ref>
