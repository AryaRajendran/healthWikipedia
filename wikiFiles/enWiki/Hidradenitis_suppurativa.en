'''Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)''' is a [[skin disease]] that most commonly affects areas bearing [[apocrine sweat glands]] or [[sebaceous glands]], such as the underarms, under the breasts, inner thighs, groin and buttocks.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alikhan|coauthors=Lynch, Eisen|title=Hidradenitis suppurativa: a comprehensive review|journal=J Am Acad Derm|year=2009|volume=60|issue=4|pages=539–561|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2008.11.911|pmid=19293006|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019096220900036X}}</ref> 

==Overview==
The non-contagious disease manifests as clusters of chronic [[abscess]]es, [[epidermoid cysts]], [[sebaceous cysts]], [[pilonidal cyst]] or multilocalised [[infections]], which can be as large as baseballs or as small as a pea. It can also start as a single abscess and once it pops, can make tracts of many more abscesses. These cysts can be extremely painful to the touch and may persist for years with occasional to frequent periods of [[inflammation]], culminating in [[incision and drainage]] of [[pus]], often leaving open wounds that will not heal. For unknown reasons, people with Hidradenitis develop plugging or clogging of their apocrine glands.<ref name="causes">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hidradenitis-suppurativa/DS00818/DSECTION=causes |title=Causes |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |date= |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> HS causes chronic scarring and pus formation of the underarms (axilla) and groin/inner thigh areas. The simple procedure of incision and drainage provides some relief from severe, often debilitating, pressure and pain.  Flare-ups may be triggered by [[perspiration]], [[hormone|hormonal]] changes (such as monthly cycles in women), humidity and heat, and friction from clothing. Persistent lesions may lead to scarring and the formation of sinus tracts, or tunnels connecting the abscesses or infections under the skin.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} At this stage, complete healing is usually not possible, and progression varies from person to person, with some experiencing [[remission (medicine)|remission]] anywhere from months to years at a time, while others may worsen and require multiple surgeries in order to live comfortably. [[Wound dehiscence]], a premature "bursting" open of a wound, often complicates the healing process.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Occurrences of [[bacterial infections]] and [[cellulitis]] (deep tissue inflammation) may occur at these sites. Hidradenitis suppurativa pain and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] can be difficult to manage.<ref name="HSUSA">{{cite web|url=http://www.hs-usa.org/hidradenitis_suppurativa.htm |title=HS-USA :: What is Hidradenitis Suppurativa? |accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>

HS often goes undiagnosed for years because patients are too ashamed to speak with anyone.<ref name="HSUSA" /> When patients see a physician or medical practitioner, the disease is frequently misdiagnosed or patients are prescribed ineffective treatments that can be temporary and sometimes even harmful.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} There is currently no known cure nor any consistently effective treatment. Carbon dioxide laser surgery is currently considered the last resort for those who have advanced to its highest stage, where the affected areas are excised, and the skin is [[grafted]]. Surgery does not always alleviate the condition, but may be very expensive.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Several articles and clinics consider this disease as widely misdiagnosed, due to the misunderstanding of the causes and progression of the disease.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gao M |title=Inversa acne (hidradenitis suppurativa): a case report and identification of the locus at chromosome 1p21.1-1q25.3 |journal=J.

;Other names for HS
Hidradenitis suppurativa has been referred to by multiple names in the literature, as well as in various cultures.  Some of these are also used to describe different diseases, or specific instances of this disease.<ref name="HSUSA" />

*[[Acne conglobata]] – not really a [[synonym]] – this is a similar process but in classic [[acne]] areas of chest and back
*Acne Inversa (AI) – a proposed new term<ref>{{Cite journal| title = "Hidradenitis suppurativa" is acne inversa!

*[[Apocrine]] [[Acne]] – a [[misnomer]], out-dated, based on the disproven concept that [[apocrine glands]] are primarily involved.  Though many do suffer with [[apocrine gland]] [[infection]], so thought should be given to using HS with subtext re: glands involved.

*Hidradenitis Supportiva – a misspelling
*Pyodermia fistulans significa – now considered archaic
*Velpeau's disease – commemorating the [[France|French]] surgeon who first described the [[disease]] in 1833
*Verneuil's disease – recognizing the French [[surgeon]] whose name is most often associated with the disorder as a result of his 1854–1865 studies<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Verneuil AS |title=Etudes sur les tumor de la peau |journal=Arch Gen Med |volume=94 |page=693 |year=1854 |language=French}}</ref>

==History==
* In 1839, [[Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau|Velpeau]] identified and described hidradenitis suppurativa.<ref>Velpeau A. Aissele. In: Bechet Jeune Z: Dictionnaire de médecine, on Repertoire Générale des Sciences Medicals sous le Rapport Theorique et Pratique. 1839.</ref>
* In 1854, [[Aristide Auguste Stanislas Verneuil|Verneuil]] described hidradenitis suppurativa as "Hidrosadénite Phlegmoneuse". This is how HS obtained its alternate name "Verneuil's disease".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Verneuil AS|title= Etudes sur les tumeurs de la peau et quelques maladies de glandes sudoripares|journal= Arch Gen Med |year=1854|volume=94|pages= 693–705}}</ref>
* In 1922, Schiefferdecker hypothesized a [[pathogenic]] link between "Acne inversa" and human [[apocrine]] sweat glands.<ref>Schiefferdecker B. Die Hautdrüsen der Menschen und der Säugetiere, ihre histologische und rassenanatomische Bedeutung sowie die muscularis sexualis. In: Schweizerbart E (Hrsg), Stuttgart: 1922.</ref>
* In 1956, Pillsbury wrote and published a medical journal article discussing hidradenitis suppurativa, describing the disease's main characteristics, dubbing them the "[[Acne triad]]: hidradenitis suppurativa, [[perifolliculitis capitis abscedens et suffodiens]]".<ref>Pillsbury DM, Shelley WB, Kligmann AM. Bacterial infections of the skin. In: Pillsbury DM: Dermatoloy. 1st ed. Philadelphia: 1956: 482–9.</ref> Pillsbury's research study was one of the first peer-reviewed journal articles to appear publicly with many details of hidradenitis suppurativa, which are still used and relied on today in the medical realm of research on this disease.
* In 1975, Plewig and Kligman, following Pillsbury's research path, modified the "[[Acne triad]]", replacing it with the "[[Acne tetrad]]: acne triad, plus [[pilonidal sinus]]".<ref>Plewig G, Kligman A. Acne. Morphogenesis and Treatment. Berlin: Springer, 1975: 192–3.</ref> Plewig and Kligman's research follows in Pillsbury's footsteps, offering explanations of the symptoms associated with hidradenitis suppurativa.
* In 1989, Plewig and Steger's research led them to rename hidradenitis suppurativa, calling it "Acne Inversa" – which is not still used today in [[medical terminology]]; although some individuals still use this outdated term.<ref name="ReferenceA">Plewig G, Steger M. Acne inversa (alias acne triad, acne tetrad or hidradenitis suppurativa). In: Marks R, Plewig G: Acne and related disorders. London: Martin Dunitz; 1989: 345–57.</ref>

A surgeon from [[Paris]], Velpeau described an unusual inflammatory process with formation of superficial [[axilla]]ry, sub-[[mammary]] and [[perianal]] abscesses in 1839. One of his colleagues also located in Paris, named Verneuil, coined the term “hidrosadénite phlegmoneuse” approximately 15 years later. This name for the disease reflects the former [[pathogenetic]] model of acne inversa, which is considered [[inflammation]] of [[sweat glands]] as the primary cause of hidradenitis suppurativa. In 1922 Schiefferdecker suspected a [[pathogenic]] association between acne inversa and apocrine sweat glands. In 1956 Pillsbury postulated follicular occlusion as the cause of acne inversa, which they grouped together with [[acne conglobata]] and perifolliculitis capitis abscendens et suffodiens (dissecting cellulitis of the scalp) as the "[[acne triad]]". Plewig and Kligman added another element to their acne triad, [[pilonidal sinus]]. Plewig et al. noted that this new "[[acne tetrad]]" includes all the elements found in the original "acne triad", in addition to a fourth element, pilonidal sinus. In 1989, Plewig and Steger introduced the term "acne inversa", indicating a follicular source of the disease and replacing older terms such as "Verneuil disease".

==Stages==

HS presents itself in three stages.<ref name="HSUSA" /><ref name="dermnetnz">{{DermNet|acne/hidradenitis-suppurativa}}</ref> Due to the large [[spectrum]] of clinical severity and the severe impact on [[quality of life]], a reliable method for evaluating HS severity is needed. Evaluation should take into account the number, type and size of [[lesions]], evolution, [[pain]] and repercussions for the [[quality of life]] of the [[patient]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Such a comprehensive instrument does not yet exist, but there have been two successful attempts proposed to classify patients with HS according to the severity of their [[disease]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Hurley's staging system===
This is historically the first classification system proposed, and is still in use for the classification of [[patients]] with skin/dermatologic [[diseases]] (i.e., [[psoriasis]], HS, [[acne]]). Hurley separated [[patients]] into three groups based largely on the presence and extent of [[cicatrization]] and sinuses. It has been used as a basis for [[clinical trials]] in the past and is a useful basis to approach [[therapy]] for patients. These three stages are based on Hurley's staging system, which is simple and relies on the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] extent of the diseased [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] the patient has. Hurley's three stages of hidradenitis suppurativa are as follows:<ref>Hurley HJ. Axillary hyperhidrosis, apocrine bromhidrosis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and familial benign pemphigus: surgical approach. In: Roenigk RK, Roenigk HH, editors. Dermatologic surgery. Marcel Dekker, New York, 1989, pp. 729–739.</ref>
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Stage
! Characteristics
|-
| I
| Solitary or multiple isolated [[abscess]] formation without scarring or sinus tracts.  (A few minor sites with rare [[inflammation]]; may be mistaken for [[Acne vulgaris|acne]].)
|-
| II
| Recurrent [[abscesses]], single or multiple widely separated [[lesions]], with sinus tract formation.  (Frequent [[inflammation]] restrict movement and may require minor [[surgery]] such as [[incision and drainage]].)
|-
| III
| Diffuse or broad involvement across a regional area with multiple interconnected sinus tracts and [[abscesses]].  ([[Inflammation]] of sites to the size of golf balls, or sometimes baseballs; scarring develops, including [[subcutaneous]] tracts of [[infection]] – see [[fistula]].  Obviously, patients at this stage may be unable to function.)
|}

===Sartorious staging system===

The Sartorious staging system is more sophisticated than Hurley's, and is likely to supplant it as a means for conducting [[clinical trials]] during research. Sartorius et al. have suggested that the Hurley system is not sophisticated enough to assess [[Therapy|treatment]] effects in [[clinical trials]]. The need for uniform outcome variables when reporting treatment effects has led to the proposition of a score by Sartorious and colleagues. This classification allows for better dynamic monitoring of the [[disease]] severity in individual patients and therefore forms a complementary system to the Hurley classification. They suggest a system that incorporates several of the involved areas of consideration:<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sartorius K, Lapins J, Emtestam L, Jemec GB|title= Suggestions for uniform outcome variables when reporting treatment effects in hidradenitis suppurativa|journal=Br J Dermatol |year=2003|volume=149|issue=1|pages=211–213|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05390.x|pmid=12890229}}</ref>
* [[Anatomic]] regions involved (axilla, groin gluteal or other region or infra-mammary region left or right)
* Number and types of [[lesions]] involved (abscesses, [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]], [[fistulas]], [[scars]], points for [[lesions]] of all regions involved)
* The distance between [[lesions]], in particular the longest distance between two relevant lesions (i.e., [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]] and [[fistulas]] in each region or size if only one lesion present)
* The presence of normal skin in between [[lesions]] (i.e., are all lesions clearly separated by normal skin?)
Points are accumulated in each of the above categories, and added to give both a regional and total score. In addition, the authors recommend adding a visual analog scale for pain or using the dermatology life quality index (DLQI, or the Skindex) when assessing HS.<ref>{{cite journal|author=|title=Quality of life impairment in hidradenitis suppurativa: a study of 61 cases |pmid=17097366|year=2007|last1=Wolkenstein|first1=P|last2=Loundou|first2=A|last3=Barrau|first3=K|last4=Auquier|first4=P|last5=Revuz|first5=J|author6=Quality of Life Group of the French Society of Dermatology|volume=56|issue=4|pages=621–3|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.08.061|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology}}</ref> This system will likely be the basis of most future [[clinical trials]] and research studies.

==Causes==

As this [[disease]] is poorly studied, the cause of Hidradenitis suppurativa remains unknown and experts disagree over proposed causes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hidradenitissuppurativa.html |title=Hidradenitis suppurativa |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> 

Hidradenitis suppurativa occurs when apocrine glands become plugged. Lesions occur in areas of the body with numerous apocrine glands such as the axilla, groin, and perianal region. This theory includes most of the following potentials indicators:<ref name="Schawartzprinciples">Schawartz's principles of surgery, 8th edition, self assessment an board review, chapter 15, the skin and subcutaneous tissue, question 16</ref>
* Post-pubescent individuals are more likely to exhibit HS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hidradenitis-suppurativa/DS00818 |title=Definition |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> 
* Females are more likely to suffer from HS than males.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* [[Genetic predisposition]] among families of [[Sephardic Jewish]], Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Northern African and Native American ancestry.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* Research is assessing possible relations with [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[squamous cell carcinoma]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* Plugged [[apocrine]] (sweat) gland or [[hair follicle]].
* [[Primary hyperhidrosis|Excessive sweating]].
* [[Bacteria]]l [[infection]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

* [[Androgen]] dysfunction.
* [[Genetic disorder]]s that alter [[cell (biology)|cell]] structure.
* Being [[overweight]] makes it worse, however this condition is not caused by [[obesity]] and weight loss will improve but not cure it.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Patients with more advanced cases may find exercise intolerably painful, which may increase the rate of obesity among sufferers.

The historical understanding of the disease is that there are dysfunctional apocrine glands<ref name="dermnetnz" /> or dysfunctional [[hair follicle]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hs-foundation.org/abouths/what.htm |title=HSF – What is Hidradenitis Suppurativa? What is HS? |accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> possibly triggered by a blocked gland, creating [[inflammation]], [[pain]], and a swollen [[lesion]].

There are a number of [[triggering]] factors that should be taken into [[consideration]], as it is advisable to avoid such triggers.

==Treatments==

Treatments may vary depending upon presentation and severity of the disease. Due to the poorly studied nature of this disease, the effectiveness of the drugs and therapies listed below is unclear, and patients should discuss all options with their physician or [[dermatologist]]. Nearly a quarter of patients state that nothing relieves their symptoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abscesses.org/hidradenitisSuppurativa/content/view/22/33/ |title=About Hidradenitis Suppurativa |accessdate=2007-07-08 |work=abscesses.org}}</ref> Possible treatments include:

* '''Lifestyle'''
** Changes in [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] avoiding inflammatory foods, foods high in refined carbohydrates.
** Warm compresses with distilled vinegar water, and taking hot baths with distilled white vinegar in the water <ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite journal|author=Martinez F, Nos P, Benlloch S, Ponce J|title= Hidradenitis suppurativa and Crohn's disease: response to treatment with infliximab|journal= Inflammatory Bowel Dis |year=2001|volume= 7|pages= 323–326|pmid=11720323|doi=10.1097/00054725-200111000-00008|issue=4}}</ref> [[hydrotherapy]], [[balneotherapy]].
** Icing the inflamed area daily until pain reduction is noticed.
** Weight loss in overweight and obese patients, as well as smoking cessation can improve or even alleviate many symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Obese and overweight patients should be encouraged to lose weight and assisted in their weight loss efforts regardless of the HS stage in which the patient currently resides.<ref name="Jemec GBE 1989. p. 375-6"/> 

* '''Medication'''
** [[Antibiotics]]- taken orally, these are used for their anti-inflammatory properties rather than to treat infection. Most effective is a combination of [[rifampicin]] and clindamycin given concurrently for 2–3 months. This brings about remission in around three quarters of cases.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gener G |title=Combination therapy with clindamycin and rifampicin for hidradenitis suppurativa: a series of 116 consecutive patients |journal=Dermatology (Basel) |volume=219 |issue=2 |pages=148–54 |year=2009 |pmid=19590173 |doi=10.1159/000228334|author2=Canoui-Poitrine F|author3=Revuz JE|display-authors=3|last4=Faye|first4=O.|last5=Poli|first5=F.|last6=Gabison|first6=G.|last7=Pouget|first7=F.|last8=Viallette|first8=C.|last9=Wolkenstein|first9=P. }}</ref> A few popular antibiotics used to treat HS include [[tetracycline]], [[minocycline]], and clindamycin.
** [[Corticosteroid]] injections. Also known as intralesional steroids: can be particularly useful for localized disease, if the drug can be prevented from escaping via the sinuses.
** [[Vitamin A]] supplementation
** [[Anti-androgen]] therapy: hormonal therapy with [[cyproterone acetate]] and [[ethinyl estradiol]] proved effective in randomized, controlled trials. Dosages reported have been very high.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mortimer PS, Dawber RP, Gales MA, Moore RA|title= A double blind controlled cross-over trial of cyproterone acetate in females with hidradenitis suppurativa|journal= Br J Dermatol |year=1986|volume= 115|pages=263–8|pmid=2944534|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.1986.tb05740.x|issue=3}}</ref>
** [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] or subcutaneous infusion of anti-inflammatory (anti-[[TNF-alpha]]) drugs such as [[infliximab]] (Remicade), [[etanercept]] (Enbrel),<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Cusack C, Buckley C |title=Etanercept: effective in the management of hidradenitis suppurativa |journal=Br. J. Dermatol. |volume=154 |issue=4 |pages=726–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16536817 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.07067.x}}</ref> and [[adalimumab]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Scheinfeld N |title=Treatment of coincident seronegative arthritis and hidradentis supprativa with adalimumab |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=163–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16781316 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.01.024}}</ref>  This use of these drugs is not currently [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved and is somewhat controversial, and therefore may not be covered by insurance.
** [[Zinc gluconate]] taken orally has been shown to induce remission. Recommended dose is at least 30&nbsp;mg taken 3 times daily (90&nbsp;mg/day).  Toxicity is known to occur at doses exceeding 1000&nbsp;mg/day.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Dermatology|year= 2007|volume=214|issue=4|pages=325–7|doi=10.1159/000100883|title=Hidradenitis Suppurativa and Zinc: A New Therapeutic Approach|author=Anabelle Brocard, Anne-Chantal Knol, Amir Khammari, Brigitte Dréno|pmid=17460404}}</ref>
** [[Chlorhexidine]] (Hibiclens) plus an antibiotic soap for cleansing the skin surface. Hexachlorophene shower with liquid soap like Phisohex, covering sores with Metrolotion after medicated showers. These are considered to be general measures, and are the foundation of any good medical treatment and management plans for HS.
** [[Turmeric]] capsules orally or through topical application. The active ingredient in the turmeric spice is [[curcumin]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
** [[Infliximab]]: a chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF antibody has demonstrated efficacy in treating HS.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>
** Topical [[clindamycin]] has been shown to have an effect in double-blind placebo controlled studies.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Clemmenson OJ|title= Topical treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa with clindamycin|journal= Int J Dermatol|year= 1983|volume= 22|pages=325–8|pmid=6347922|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4362.1983.tb02150.x|issue=5}}</ref>
** Topical [[resorcinol]] is a keratolytic agent that targets the follicular keratin plug and has been shown to have efficacy in several case series studies.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Boer J|title=Resorcinol peels as a possible self-treatment of painful nodules in hidradenitis suppurativa.|journal=Clin Exp Dermatol|year=2010|volume=35|issue=1|pages=36–40|pmid=19549239}}</ref>

* '''Radiation'''
Electron beam radiotherapy has been a successful treatment of hidradenitis, especially in Europe; it is not a common treatment option in most of the United States, as [[radiation oncologists]] generally refuse to treat patients with non-malignant diseases because of the potential for secondary radiation-induced tumors in the long term.

* '''Surgical therapy'''
When the process becomes chronic, wide surgical excision is the procedure of choice. Wounds in the affected area do not heal by secondary intention, and immediate application of a split thickness skin graft is more appropriate.<ref name="Schawartzprinciples" />
