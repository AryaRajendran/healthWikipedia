{{about|the health effects of non-ionizing radiation|the health effects of ionizing radiation|radiation poisoning}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] can be classified into two types: [[ionization|ionizing]] radiation and [[non-ionizing radiation]], based on its capability of ionizing atoms and breaking [[chemical bond]]s. [[Ultraviolet]] and higher frequencies, such as [[X-ray]]s or [[gamma ray]]s are ionizing, and these pose their own special hazards: see ''[[radiation]]'' and ''[[radiation poisoning]]''. Non-ionizing radiation, discussed here, is associated with electrical and biological hazards.

==Types of hazards==
===Electrical hazards===
Strong radiation can induce current capable of delivering an electric shock to persons or animals. It can also overload and destroy electrical equipment. The induction of currents by oscillating magnetic fields is also the way in which solar storms disrupt the operation of electrical and electronic systems, causing damage to and even the explosion of power distribution transformers,<ref>http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/storms.html</ref> blackouts (as occurred in [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm | 1989]]), and interference with electromagnetic signals (''e.g.'' radio, TV, and telephone signals).<ref>[http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/podcasts/media/Blackout/Blackout_part4.htm Transcript of "Blackout: The Sun-Earth Connection", Part 4: When Solar Plasma Distorts Earth's Magnetic Field]</ref> <!-- I don't have time to do research to find another, more stable reference, such as from a scientific journal or textbook, but these one from NASA cover the subject with, I think, adequate authority to justify the sentence. -->

===Fire hazards===
Extremely high power electromagnetic radiation can cause electric currents strong enough to create sparks (electrical arcs) when an induced voltage exceeds the [[breakdown voltage]] of the surrounding medium (''e.g.'' air). These sparks can then ignite flammable materials or gases, possibly leading to an explosion.

This can be a particular hazard in the vicinity of [[explosives]] or [[pyrotechnics]], since an electrical overload might ignite them. This risk is commonly referred to as [[Hazards EM Ordnance|HERO]] (Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance). MIL-STD-464A mandates assessment of HERO in a system, but Navy document OD 30393 provides design principles and practices for controlling electromagnetic hazards to ordnance.

On the other hand, the risk related to fueling is known as [[Hazards EM for Fuel|HERF]] (Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Fuel). NAVSEA OP 3565 Vol. 1 could be used to evaluate HERF, which states a maximum power density of 0.09 W/m² for frequencies under 225&nbsp;MHz (i.e. 4.2 meters for a 40 W emitter).

===Biological hazards===
The best understood biological effect of electromagnetic fields is to cause [[dielectric heating]]. For example, touching or standing around an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] while a high-power [[transmitter]] is in operation can cause severe burns. These are exactly the kind of burns that would be caused inside a [[microwave oven]].

This heating effect varies with the power and the [[frequency]] of the electromagnetic energy. A measure of the heating effect is the [[specific absorption rate]] or SAR, which has units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). The [[IEEE]]<ref>{{cite journal

A 2009 study at the University of Basel in Switzerland found that intermittent (but not continuous) exposure of human cells to a 50&nbsp;Hz electromagnetic field at a flux density of 1 [[Tesla (unit)|mT]] (or 10 [[Gauss (unit)|G]]) induced a slight but significant increase of DNA fragmentation in the [[Comet assay]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Focke F, Schuermann D, Kuster N, Schär P |title=DNA fragmentation in human fibroblasts under extremely low frequency electromagnetic field exposure |journal=Mutation Research |volume= 683|issue= 1–2|pages= 74–83|year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19896957 |doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.10.012}}</ref> However that level of exposure is already above current established safety exposure limits.

==Positions of governments and scientific bodies==
===World Health Organization===
In May 2011, the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer published a review of the evidence on health risks of [[electromagnetic field]]s (EMFs), and concluded that there was limited evidence that cellphone users might be at increased risk of glioma and acoustic neuroma, and that there was inadequate evidence of any other health risks posed by EMF.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-01|title=IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans|date=2011-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Carcinogenicity of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields |author=Baan R, Grosse Y, Lauby-Secretan B, El Ghissassi F, Bouvard V, Benbrahim-Tallaa L, Guha N, Islami F, Galichet L, Straif K, on behalf of the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer Monograph Working Group |journal=The Lancet Oncology |date=1 July 2011 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=624–6 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(11)70147-4 |pmid=21845765}} (free, registration required)</ref> This "possibly carcinogenic" classification was often misinterpreted, meaning only "that there is very little scientific evidence as to the carcinogenicity of cell phone use".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Cell phones, cancer, and children |author=Boice JD Jr, Tarone RE |journal=J Natl Cancer Inst |year=2011 |volume=103 |issue=16 |pages=1211–3 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djr285 |pmid=21795667 }}</ref>

===U.S. military definition===
In [[Federal Standard 1037C]], the [[United States]] government adopts the following definition:

:'''Electromagnetic radiation hazards''' (RADHAZ or EMR hazards):  Hazards caused by a transmitter/antenna installation that generates [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the vicinity of ordnance, personnel, or fueling operations in excess of established safe levels or increases the existing levels to a hazardous level; or a personnel, fueling, or ordnance installation located in an area that is illuminated by electromagnetic radiation at a level that is hazardous to the planned operations or occupancy. These hazards will exist when an electromagnetic [[field (physics)|field]] of sufficient [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] is generated to: (a) induce or otherwise couple currents or voltages large enough to initiate electroexplosive devices or other sensitive explosive components of weapon systems, ordnance, or explosive devices; (b) cause harmful or injurious effects to humans and wildlife; (c) create sparks having sufficient magnitude to ignite flammable mixtures of materials that must be handled in the affected area.  &mdash;[[Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms]]

== Electric power transmission ==
The [[preponderance of evidence]] suggests that the low-power, low-frequency, electromagnetic radiation associated with [[electric power transmission|household current]] does not constitute a short or long term health hazard, and although some biophysical mechanisms for the promotion of cancer have been proposed (such as the electric fields around power lines attracting [[aerosol]] pollutants<ref name="Fews PMID 10622257">{{cite journal |author=Fews AP, Henshaw DL, Keitch PA, Close JJ, Wilding RJ |title=Increased exposure to pollutant aerosols under high voltage power lines |journal=International Journal of Radiation Biology |volume=75 |issue=12 |pages=1505–21 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=10622257 |doi=10.1080/095530099139115}} (primary source)</ref><ref name="Fews PMID 10622258">{{cite journal |author=Fews AP, Henshaw DL, Wilding RJ, Keitch PA |title=Corona ions from power lines and increased exposure to pollutant aerosols |journal=International Journal of Radiation Biology |volume=75 |issue=12 |pages=1523–31 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=10622258 |doi=10.1080/095530099139124}} (primary source)</ref>), none have been substantiated. <ref name='WHOFactsheet322'>{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs322/en/index.html|title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: Exposure to extremely low frequency fields| accessdate=January 23, 2008 |year= 2007|month= June|work= Fact sheet No. 322|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}</ref><ref name='WHO fact sheet 296'>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs296/en/index.html |title=Electromagnetic fields and public health: Electromagnetic hypersensitivity|year =2005 |month = December |accessdate=November 17, 2007 |work= Fact sheet No.296 | publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref><ref name='APS_health'>{{cite web|url=http://www.aps.org/policy/statements/05_3.cfm |title=Electric and Magnetic Fields and Public Health |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |date=April 15, 2005 |work=National Policy |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] }}</ref><ref name='NIEHS'>{{cite web|url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/docs/emf-02.pdf |title=Electric and Magnetic Fields Associated with the Use of Power |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |date=2002-06 |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] }}</ref><ref name='ICNIRP'>{{cite journal |author=International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection |title=ICNIRP statement related to the use of security and similar devices utilizing electromagnetic fields |journal=Health Physics |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=187–96 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15257219 |quote=Similarly, there is no convincing evidence for an association with neurologic disease, birth defects, heart disease, or suicide. |doi=10.1097/00004032-200408000-00007}}</ref><ref name='AMA_ELF'>{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/no-index/about-ama/13682.shtml |title=Report 7 of the Council on Scientific Affairs (I-94) |accessdate=December 3, 2009 |publisher=American Medical Association |month=December |year=1994 |quote=no scientifically documented health risk has been associated with the usually occurring levels of electromagnetic fields}}</ref>  Nevertheless, some research has reported correlation with a number of adverse health effects, although controversy can include [[Correlation does not imply causation|whether observed correlation implies causation]].

=== Mitigation ===
One response to the potential dangers of overhead power lines is to place them underground. The earth and enclosures surrounding underground cables prevent the electric field from radiating significantly beyond the power lines, and greatly reduce the magnetic field strength radiating from the power lines, into the surrounding area.<ref>[http://www.emfs.info/Source_underground.asp UK National Grid EMF information site]</ref> However, the cost of burying and maintaining cables at transmission voltages is several times greater than overhead power lines.<ref>See [[Electric power transmission#Underground transmission]] for details and references.</ref>

===Leukemia and cancer===
====Suggesting no significant link====
In 1997 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) released a report published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'', the result of a seven-year epidemiological investigation. The study investigated 638 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 620 controls and concluded that their study provided "little evidence that living in homes characterized by high measured time-weighted average magnetic-field levels or by the highest wire-code category increases the risk of ALL in children."<ref name=pmid9203424>{{cite journal |author=Linet MS, Hatch EE, Kleinerman RA, ''et al.'' |title=Residential exposure to magnetic fields and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=337 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=1997 |month=July |pmid=9203424 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199707033370101}}</ref>  Following the report, the US Department of Energy disbanded the EMF Research and Public Information Dissemination (RAPID) Program, saying that its services were no longer needed.<ref>{{Cite book |year=2000 |author=Park, Robert L |authorlink=Robert L.

In 2005, the Canadian Federal-Provincial-Territorial Radiation Protection Committee said, "The outcome of a recently conducted pooled analysis of several epidemiological studies shows a two-fold increase in the risk of leukemia in children living in homes, where the average magnetic field levels are greater than 0.4 microtesla (4 milligauss). [However,] it is the opinion of [this committee] that the epidemiological evidence to date is not strong enough to justify a conclusion that EMFs in Canadian homes, regardless of locations from power lines, cause leukemia in children."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aeei.gov.sk.ca/response-statement-power-frequency-magnetic-fields-and-childhood-Leukemia |format=PDF |title= Response statement to the issue of power-frequency magnetic fields and childhood leukemia |publisher= Federal-Provincial-Territorial Radiation Protection Committee |date=2005-01-20|accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref>

The World Health Organization issued a fact sheet, No. 322, in June, 2007 based on the findings of a WHO work group (2007), the IARC (2002) and the ICNIRP (2003), which reviewed research conducted since the earlier publication. The fact sheet says "that there are no substantive health issues related to ELF electric fields at levels generally encountered by members of the public." For ELF magnetic fields, the fact sheet says, "the evidence related to childhood leukaemia is not strong enough to be considered causal", and "<nowiki>[as regards]</nowiki> other childhood cancers, cancers in adults,&nbsp;... The WHO Task Group concluded that scientific evidence supporting an association between ELF magnetic field exposure and all of these health effects is much weaker than for childhood leukaemia. In some instances (i.e., for&nbsp;... breast cancer) the evidence suggests that these fields do not cause them."<ref name="WHOFactsheet322"/>

According to Dr. Lakshmikumar at the National Physical Laboratory, India, a direct, causal, link between RF radiation and cancer (including leukemia) would require one to be "willing to discard [[Planck's Law]]… and the entire body of quantum physics." <ref>{{cite journal |author=Lakshmikumar ST |year=2009 |title=Power line panic and mobile mania |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=35 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/power_line_panic_and_mobile_mania }}</ref>

In 2010, Maslanyj ''et al.'', applying the [[Bradford-Hill criteria]] to available evidence, considered the application of low-cost exposure reduction measures as appropriate [[precautionary principle|precautionary]] responses to "small and uncertain public health risks". Even after pooling all the data, they found it fell short of establishing "[[strength of association]], [[dose-response relationship]], [[biological plausibility]] and [[biological coherence|coherence]], and analogy". They recognised that controversy would continue so long as other interpretations of the data were possible.<ref name="pmid21054823">{{cite journal |author=Maslanyj M, Lightfoot T, Schüz J, Sienkiewicz Z, McKinlay A |title=A precautionary public health protection strategy for the possible risk of childhood leukaemia from exposure to power frequency magnetic fields |journal=BMC Public Health |date=2010-11-05 |volume=10 |pages=673 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-673 |pmid=21054823 |pmc=3091578 }}</ref>

The [[World Health Organisation]] issued Factsheet No. 263 in October 2001 on ELF (Extremely low frequency) EMFs and cancer.

====UK SAGE report====
The UK Department of Health set up the Stakeholder Advisory Group on ELF EMFs (SAGE) to explore the implications and to make recommendations for a [[precautionary approach]] to power frequency electric and magnetic fields in light of any evidence of a link between EMF and childhood leukemia.  The first interim assessment of this group was released in April 2007 [http://www.rkpartnership.co.uk/sage/Public/SAGE%20supporting%20papers%20first%20interim%20assessment.pdf ], and found that the link between proximity to power lines and childhood leukemia was sufficient to warrant a precautionary recommendation, including an option to lay new power lines underground where possible and to prevent the building of new residential buildings within {{Convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} of existing power lines.  The latter of these options was not an official recommendation to government as the cost-benefit analysis based on the increased risk for childhood leukemia alone was considered insufficient to warrant it. The option was considered necessary for inclusion as, if found to be real, the weaker association with other health effects would make it worth implementing.<ref>
