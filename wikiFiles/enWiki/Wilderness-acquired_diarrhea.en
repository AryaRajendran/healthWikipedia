'''Wilderness acquired diarrhea''' (WAD), '''wilderness-acquired diarrhea''', '''wilderness diarrhea''', or '''backcountry diarrhea''', is [[diarrhea]] that is caused by [[pathogens]] that have [[Infectious disease|infected]] people when they were in the [[wilderness]]. It is a much-discussed hazard among backpackers, hikers, campers and other outdoor recreationalists who visit remote areas of the developed world.<ref name='Zell1992'>{{cite journal

==Names and definitions==
Diarrhea acquired in the wilderness or other remote areas is typically a form of [[infectious diarrhea]], itself classified as a type of [[Diarrhea#Types of diarrhea|secretory diarrhea]]. These are all considered forms of [[gastroenteritis]]. The term may be applied in various remote areas of non-tropical developed countries (U.S., Canada, western Europe, etc.), but is less applicable in developing countries, and in the tropics, because of the different [[pathogens]] that are most likely to cause infection.<ref name="Backer editorial 1992"/>

==Causes==
Infectious diarrhea acquired in the wilderness is caused by various [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], and parasites ([[protozoa]]). The most commonly reported are the protozoa ''Giardia'' and ''Cryptosporidium''.<ref>{{harvard citation|Backer|2007|p=1371}}</ref> Other infectious agents may play a larger role than generally believed<ref name="Zell1992" /> and include ''[[Campylobacter]]'', [[hepatitis A virus]], [[hepatitis E virus]], enterotoxogenic ''[[E. coli]]'', ''E. coli'' O157:H7, ''[[Shigella]]'', and various other viruses. More rarely, ''[[Yersinia enterocolitica]]'', ''[[Aeromonas hydrophila]]'', and ''[[Cyanobacterium]]'' may also cause disease.<ref>{{harvard citation|Backer|2007|p=1369}}</ref>

''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' does not tolerate freezing but can remain viable for nearly three months in river water when the temperature is 10°C and about one month at 15–20°C in lake water. ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' may survive in cold waters (4°C) for up to 18 months, and can even withstand freezing, although its viability is thereby greatly reduced.<ref name='Health Canada 2004'>{{Cite book| first= | last=Prepared by Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Drinking Water of the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Health and the Environment (2004)| coauthors=| contribution=Protozoa: Giardia and Cryptosporidium| title=Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality: Supporting Documentation| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=Health Canada| place=| pages=| date=| year=2004| id= | contribution-url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/pubs/water-eau/protozoa/protozoa.pdf| format=| accessdate=2008-08-07 }}</ref> Many other varieties of diarrhea-causing organisms, including ''[[Shigella]]'' and ''[[Salmonella typhi]]'', and hepatitis A virus, can survive freezing for weeks to months.<ref name="Dickens1985">{{cite journal |author=Dickens DL, DuPont HL, Johnson PC |title=Survival of bacterial enteropathogens in the ice of popular drinks |journal=JAMA |volume=253 |issue=21 |pages=3141–3 |year=1985 |month=June |pmid=3889393 |doi= 10.1001/jama.253.21.3141|url=}}</ref> Virologists believe all surface water in the United States and Canada has the potential to contain human viruses, which cause a wide range of illnesses including diarrhea, polio and meningitis.<ref name=Backer2000>{{cite journal |author=Backer H |title=In search of the perfect water treatment method |journal=Wilderness Environ Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |year=2000 |pmid=10731899 |doi= |url=http://www.wemjournal.org/pdfserv/i1080-6032-011-01-0001.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-387-97162-9">{{cite book |author=Gerba C, Rose J |chapter=Viruses in Source and Drinking Water |editor=McFeters, Gordon A. ed.|title=Drinking water microbiology: progress and recent developments |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |year=1990 |pages=380–99 |isbn=0-387-97162-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-442-00693-4">{{cite book |author=White, George W. |title=The handbook of chlorination and alternative disinfectants |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |location=New York |year=1992 |edition=3rd |pages= |isbn=0-442-00693-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Modes of acquiring infection from these causes are limited to fecal-oral transmission, and contaminated water and food. The major factor governing pathogen content of surface water is human and animal activity in the watershed.<ref>{{harvard citation|Backer|2007|p=1374}}</ref> The risk of WAD from untreated water may have been over-stated relative to the risk from insufficient [[hygiene]].<ref name='Welch2004' />

==Symptoms==
The average [[incubation period]]s for [[giardiasis]] and [[cryptosporidiosis]] are each 7 days.<ref name='CDCgiardia2004'>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/giardiasis/factsht_giardia.htm#symptoms_begin |title=CDC Fact sheet: Giardiasis |accessdate=2008-10-13 |last=CDC Division of Parasitic Diseases |year=2004 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control }}</ref><ref name='CDCcrypto2008'>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/crypto/disease.html |title="Crypto" - Cryptosporiodosis |accessdate=2008-10-13 |last= National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases |date=2008-04-16 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control }}</ref> Certain other bacterial and viral agents have shorter incubation periods, although hepatitis may take weeks to manifest itself. The onset usually occurs within the first week of return from the field, but may also occur at any time while hiking.

Most cases begin abruptly and usually result in increased frequency, volume, and weight of stool. Typically, a hiker experiences at least four to five loose or watery bowel movements each day. Other commonly associated symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, bloating, low fever, urgency, and malaise, and usually the appetite is affected. The condition is much more serious if there is blood or [[mucus]] in stools, abdominal pain, or high fever. [[Dehydration]] is a possibility. Life-threatening illness resulting from WAD is extremely rare but can occur in people with weakened immune systems.

Some people may be carriers and not exhibit symptoms.

==Diagnosis==
It may be difficult to associate a particular case of diarrhea with a recent wilderness trip of a few days because incubation of the disease may outlast the trip. Studies of trips<ref name=Boulware2004 /><ref name=Boulware2003 /> that are much longer than the average incubation period, e.g. a week for ''Cryptosporidium'' and ''Giardia'',<ref name=CDCgiardia2004 /><ref name=CDCcrypto2008 /> are less susceptible to these errors since there is enough time for the diarrhea to occur during the trip. Other bacterial and viral agents have shorter incubation periods, although hepatitis may require weeks.

A suspected case of wilderness acquired diarrhea may be assessed within the general context of intestinal complaints. During any given four-week period, as many as 7.2% of Americans may experience some form of infectious or non-infectious diarrhea.<ref name='Scallon2002'>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/enterics/publications/240-scallan_2004.pdf |format=PDF|title=Prevalence of Diarrhea in the Community in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the United States |accessdate=2008-10-15 |last=Scallan |first=E.

==Treatment==
WAD is typically self-limited, generally resolving without specific treatment. [[Oral rehydration therapy]] with rehydration salts is often beneficial to replace lost fluids and [[electrolytes]]. Clear, disinfected water or other liquids are routinely recommended.

Hikers who develop three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period&nbsp;— especially if associated with [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[abdominal]] [[cramps]], [[fever]], or [[blood in stool]]s&nbsp;— should be treated by a doctor and may benefit from antibiotics, usually given for 3–5 days. Alternatively, a single dose [[azithromycin]] or [[levofloxacin]] may be prescribed.<ref name="Sanders2007">{{cite journal |author=Sanders JW, Frenck RW, Putnam SD, ''et al.'' |title=Azithromycin and loperamide are comparable to levofloxacin and loperamide for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in United States military personnel in Turkey |journal=Clin.

''Cryptosporidium'' can be quite dangerous to patients with compromised immune systems. Alinia (nitazoxanide) is approved by the FDA for treatment of ''Cryptosporidium''.

==Prevention==
Since wilderness acquired diarrhea can be caused by insufficient hygiene, contaminated water, and (possibly) increased susceptibility from vitamin deficiency, prevention methods should address these causes.

===Hygiene===
The risk of fecal-oral transmission of pathogens that cause diarrhea can be significantly reduced by good hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water after urination and defecation, and washing eating utensils with warm soapy water.<ref name=Boulware2004 /> Additionally a [[three-bowl system]] can be used for washing eating utensils.<ref name="Hargreaves2006"/>

===Treating water===
{{Main|Portable water purification}}
Water can be treated in the wilderness through filtering, chemical disinfectants, a portable ultraviolet light device, [[pasteurizing]] or boiling.<ref name='Backer2007'>{{harvard citation|Backer|2007|pp=1368–417}}</ref><ref name=Johnson2003>{{cite book

}}</ref> Factors in choice may include the number of people involved, space and weight considerations, the quality of available water, personal taste and preferences, and fuel availability.

In a study of long-distance backpacking, it was found that water filters were used more consistently than chemical disinfectants. Inconsistent use of iodine or chlorine may be due to disagreeable taste, extended treatment time or treatment complexity due to water temperature and turbidity.<ref name=Boulware2003 />

Because methods based on [[halogens]], such as iodine and chlorine, do not kill ''Cryptosporidium'', and because filtration misses some viruses, the best protection may require a two-step process of either filtration or coagulation-[[flocculation]], followed by [[halogenation]]. Boiling is effective in all situations.

Iodine resins, if combined with microfiltration to remove resistant cysts, are also a viable single-step process, but may not be effective under all conditions. New one-step techniques using chlorine dioxide, ozone, and UV radiation may prove effective, but still require validation.<ref name='Backer2002'>{{cite journal |author=Backer H |title=Water disinfection for international and wilderness travelers |journal=Clin.

Ultraviolet (UV) light for water disinfection is well established and widely used for large applications, like municipal water systems. Some hikers use small portable UV devices which meet the U.S. EPA Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers, for example, the SteriPEN.<ref>{{harvard citation|Backer|2007|Ref=none |p=1411}}</ref><ref name='SteripenProveTech2008'>{{cite web|url=http://www.steripen.com/proven_in_lab.html |title=Steripen - Proven Technology |accessdate=2008-10-14 |year=2008 |publisher=Hydro-Photon, Inc. }}</ref><ref name='SteripenMicrobioTest2008'>{{cite web|url=http://www.steripen.com/testing.html |title=Steripen - Microbiological Testing |accessdate=2008-10-14 |year=2008 |publisher=Hydro-Photon, Inc. }}</ref> Another approach to portable UV water purification is [[Portable water purification#Solar water disinfection|solar disinfection]] which is called [[SODIS]]. Clear water is sterilized by putting it in a clear polyethylene ([[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]]) bottle and leaving it in direct sunlight for 6 hours.<ref name='CDC_SODIS2008'>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdc.gov/safewater/publications_pages/options-sodis.pdf | title = Household Water Treatment Options in Developing Countries: Solar Disinfection (SODIS) | accessdate = 2010-07-31 | date = 2008-01 | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)}}</ref>

===Water risk avoidance===
Different types of water sources may have different levels of contamination:<ref name='Rockwell2003'>{{cite web |url=http://www.peakclimbing.org/articles/giardia_2003.pdf |format=PDF|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5bd7Yos7y |archivedate=2008-10-16 |title=Giardia Lamblia and Giardiasis With Particular Attention to the Sierra Nevada |last=Rockwell |first=Robert L. |year=2003 |work=Peak Climbing Section, Loma Prieta Chapter, Sierra Club }}</ref><ref name='Backer2007 1373-4'>{{harvard citation|Backer|2007|pp=1373–4}}</ref>
* More contamination may be in water that
# likely could have passed through an area subject to heavy human or animal use
# is cloudy, has surface foam, or has some other suspicious appearance.
* Less contamination may be in water from
# springs (provided the true source is not surface water a short distance above)
# large streams (those entering from the side may have less contamination than those paralleling the trail)
# fast-flowing streams
# higher elevations
# lakes with undisturbed sediments (10 days undisturbed water storage can result in 75-99% removal of [[coliform bacteria]] by settling to the bottom)
# freshly melted snow
# deep wells (provided they aren't subject to contamination from surface runoff)
# regions where there was a heavy snow year when streams run full and long compared to dry years.
Rain storms can either improve or worsen water quality. They can wash contaminants into water and stir up contaminated sediments with increasing flow, but can also dilute contaminants by adding large amounts of water.<ref name='Backer2007 1373-4' />

Unfortunately, there have not been any epidemiological studies to validate the above, except possibly for the case of spring water.<ref name= Boulware2004 />

===Vitamins===
One study suggests that on very long trips in the wilderness, taking [[multivitamin]]s may reduce the incidence of diarrhea.<ref name=Boulware2004 />

==Epidemiology==
The risk of acquiring infectious diarrhea in the wilderness arises from inadvertent ingestion of pathogens. Various studies have sought to estimate diarrhea [[attack rate]]s among wilderness travelers, and results have ranged widely. The variation of diarrhea rate between studies may depend on the time of year, the location of the study, the length of time the hikers were in the wilderness,<ref name=Boulware2004 /><ref name="Gardner2002">{{cite journal

<!-- LIKELIHOOD of getting diarrhea -->
The [[National Outdoor Leadership School]] (NOLS), which emphasizes strict hand-washing techniques, water disinfection and washing of common cooking utensils in their programs, reports that gastrointestinal illnesses occurred at a rate of only 0.26 per 1000 program days.<ref name='McIntosh2007'>{{cite journal|title=Medical incidents and evacuations on wilderness expeditions|journal=Wilderness and Environmental Medicine|year=2007|first=Scott E.|last=McIntosh|coauthors=Drew Leemon, Joshua Visitacion, et al.|volume=18|issue=4|pages=298–304|pmid=18076301 |url=http://www.nols.edu/resources/research/pdfs/medical_incidents_evacs.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=|doi=10.1580/07-WEME-OR-093R1.1 }}</ref> By contrast, studies of hiking trips on the [[Appalachian Trail]] that averaged almost 5&nbsp;months, reported that more than half of the hikers experienced at least one episode of diarrhea that lasted an average of 2&nbsp;days.

<!-- WHICH PATHOGEN for diarrhea if you get it -->
A variety of pathogens can cause diarrhea, and most cases among backpackers appear to be caused by bacteria from [[feces]]. A study at Grand Teton National Park found 69% of diarrhea affected visitors had no identifiable cause, that 23% had diarrhea due to [[Campylobacter]] and 8% of patients with diarrhea had [[giardiasis]]. Campylobacter enteritis occurred most frequently in young adults who had hiked in wilderness areas and drunk untreated surface water in the week prior.<ref name='Taylor1983'>{{cite journal|title=Campylobacter enteritis from untreated water in the Rocky Mountains|journal=Ann Intern Med|year=1983|first=D.

Most surveys of backcountry water in the United States have found very low or no ''Giardia'' cysts.<ref name="Rockwell2003" /><ref name="Zell1993" /> However, very few studies have addressed the issue of transient contamination. According to one researcher, the likely model for the risk of ''Giardia'' from wilderness water is pulse contamination, that is, a brief period of high cyst concentration from fecal contamination.<ref name="Backer editorial 1992" /><ref>{{harvard citation|Backer|2007|p=1372}}</ref>
