'''''Dipylidium caninum,''''' also called the '''cucumber [[tapeworm]]''' or the '''double-pore''' tapeworm, is a [[cyclophyllid]] [[cestode]] that infects organisms afflicted with [[flea]]s and [[Trichodectes canis|canine chewing lice]], including [[canids|dogs]], [[felid|cat]]s, and pet-owners, especially children.  Adult worms are about {{convert|18|in|cm}} long.  [[Gravid]] [[proglottid]]s containing the worm's microscopic eggs  are either passed in the definitive host's feces or may leave their host spontaneously and are then ingested by flea larvae (the intermediate hosts) in the surrounding environment.  These larvae eventually [[pupa|pupate]] and transform into adult fleas which are then ingested by a dog or cat during grooming activity.  Examples of fleas that can spread ''D. caninum'' include ''[[Dog flea|Ctenocephalides canis]]'' and ''[[Cat flea|Ctenocephalides felis]].''

As in all members of [[family (biology)|family]] [[Dipylidiidae]], [[proglottid]]s of the adult worm have genital pores on both sides (hence the name ''double-pore tapeworm'').  Each side has a set of male and female reproductive organs.  The uterus is paired with 16 to 20 radial branches each. The [[scolex]] has a [[rostellum]] with four rows of hooks, along with the four suckers that all cyclophyllid cestodes have.

In children, infection causes diarrhea and restlessness.  As with most tapeworm infections, the drugs of choice are [[niclosamide]] or [[praziquantel]].  The best way to prevent human infection is to treat infected animals to kill fleas. Tapeworm infection usually does not cause pathology in the dog or cat.

The other tapeworm commonly infecting cats is ''[[Taenia taeniaeformis]]''.
