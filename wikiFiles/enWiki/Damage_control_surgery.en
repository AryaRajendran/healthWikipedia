'''Damage control surgery''' ('''DCS''') is a form of surgery utilized in [[poly trauma|severe]] [[unstable]] [[trauma (medicine)|injuries]] typically by [[trauma surgeon]]s. This form of surgery puts more emphasis on preventing the [[trauma triad of death]], rather than correcting the [[anatomy]].<ref name="pmid19303379">{{cite journal |author=Jaunoo SS, Harji DP |title=Damage control surgery |journal=International Journal of Surgery (London, England) |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=110–3 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19303379 |doi=10.1016/j.ijsu.2009.01.008 |url= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref><ref name="fries">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.mpsur.2010.08.002}}</ref>

==Indications==
This procedure is generally indicated when a person sustains a severe injury that impairs their ability to maintain [[homeostasis]] due to severe [[hemorrhage]] leading to [[metabolic acidosis]], [[hypothermia]], and decreased [[coagulation cascade|coagulopathy]].<ref name="mcgraw">{{cite book |author=Garth Meckler; Cline, David; Cydulka, Rita K.; Thomas, Stephen R.; Dan Handel |title=Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine Manual 7/E |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year=2012 |pages= |isbn=0-07-178184-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> This phenomenon is referred to as the trauma triad of death.<ref name="era">{{cite journal |author=Midwinter MJ |title=Damage control surgery in the era of damage control resuscitation |journal=Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps |volume=155 |issue=4 |pages=323–6 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=20397611 |doi= |url= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> A common clinical presentation of this would include [[metabolic acidosis]], [[hypotension]], and [[hypothermia]].<ref name="fries"/><ref name="era"/><ref name="abd"/> The reason why a regular fix would not work is because the person would succumb to the [[physiology|physiologic]] effects of the injury, despite the [[anatomy|anatomical]] correction.

==Technique==
A major component of the surgery is early recognition of a person who could benefit from it, which often means bypassing the [[emergency department]] except for attempts of immediate stabilization techniques, such as gaining airway access.<ref name="era"/><ref>Moore 2013, p. 725</ref> Typically the [[operating room]] is [[heat]]ed higher than normal to help deal with the associated hypothermia.<ref name="abd">{{cite journal |author=Sugrue M, D'Amours SK, Joshipura M |title=Damage control surgery and the abdomen |journal=Injury |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=642–8 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15203303 |doi=10.1016/j.injury.2004.03.011 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002013830400083X |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> 

The procedure comprises three different steps that are needed for full effect. In the first procedure a [[laparotomy]] is performed to control hemorrhage.<ref name="india">{{cite doi|10.1016/S0377-1237(06)80015-8}}</ref> Generally this procedure will last no longer than one hour.<ref name="abd"/> After immediate life threats have been surgically managed, the area is then covered temporarily and the person sent to an [[intensive care unit]] for the second phase.<ref name="india"/><ref name="usa">{{cite journal |author=Blackbourne LH |title=Defining combat damage control surgery |journal=U.S. Army Medical Department Journal |volume= |issue= |pages=67–72 |year=2008 |pmid=20091976 |doi= |url=http://www.cs.amedd.army.mil/AMEDDJournal/2008janmar.pdf |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> 

In the second phase the patient is given a combination of various [[medication]]s and treatments to help restore a [[homeostasis|physiologic balance]], especially with regards to their temperature, oxygenation, and pH level.<ref name="mcgraw"/> An important element of treatment at this stage is passive rewarming, as generally it will reverse most of the ill effects of the trauma triad.<ref name="fries"/> This phase generally lasts no longer than two days but is dependent on the persons condition.<ref name="india"/> When the person does not have their condition improved within the first 24 hours it could mean there was missed hemorrhage which could require immediate surgery, regardless of the reversal of the trauma triad.<ref>Moore 2013, p. 737</ref> 

In the third phase, the person is operated on again and more definitive procedures are performed.<ref name="mcgraw"/><ref name="india"/>

==History==
The first recorded instance of damage control surgery was in 1983 by Stone.<ref name="stone">{{cite journal |author=Stone HH, Strom PR, Mullins RJ |title=Management of the major coagulopathy with onset during laparotomy |journal=Annals of Surgery |volume=197 |issue=5 |pages=532–5 |year=1983 |month=May |pmid=6847272 |pmc=1353025 |doi= |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0003-4932&volume=197&issue=5&spage=532 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> In 1993, Rotondo was the first to show definitive proof that damage control surgery yielded better outcomes than alternatives, and coined the term.<ref name="pmid8371295">{{cite journal |author=Rotondo MF, Schwab CW, McGonigal MD, ''et al.'' |title='Damage control': an approach for improved survival in exsanguinating penetrating abdominal injury |journal=The Journal of Trauma |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=375–82; discussion 382–3 |year=1993 |month=September |pmid=8371295 |doi= |url= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref>
