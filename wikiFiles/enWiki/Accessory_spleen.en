An '''accessory spleen''' (''supernumerary spleen'', ''splenule'', or ''splenunculus'') is a small nodule of splenic tissue found apart from the main body of the [[spleen]].  Accessory spleens are found in approximately 10 percent of the population<ref name=klmoore>{{cite book | last = Moore | first = Keith L. | authorlink = Keith L.

Accessory spleens may be formed during [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] when some of the cells from the developing spleen are deposited along the path from the midline, where the spleen forms, over to its final location on the left side of the abdomen by the 9th–11th ribs. The most common locations for accessory spleens are the hilum of the spleen and adjacent to the tail of the pancreas. They may be found anywhere along the splenic vessels, in the [[gastrosplenic ligament]], the [[splenorenal ligament]], the walls of the [[stomach]] or [[intestine]]s, the [[tail of pancreas|pancreatic tail]],<ref name=shkim>{{cite journal | author = Kim SH | coauthors = Lee JM, Han JK, Lee JY, Kim KW, Cho KC, Choi BI | year = 2008 | month = Mar–April | title = Intrapancreatic Accessory Spleen: Findings on MR Imaging, CT, US and Scintigraphy, and the Pathologic Analysis | journal = Korean J Radiol | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 162–174 | publisher = Korean Radiological Society | pmc = 2627219 | doi = 10.3348/kjr.2008.9.2.162 | pmid = 18385564}}</ref> the [[greater omentum]], the [[mesentery]] or the [[gonad]]s and their path of [[development of the gonads|descent]].<ref name=slchen>{{cite journal | author = Chen S–L | coauthors =  Kao Y–L, Sun H–S, Lin W–L | year = 2008 | month = November | title = Splenogonadal Fusion | journal = Journal of the  Formosan Medical Association | volume = 107 | issue = 11 | pages = 892–5 | issn = 0929-6646 | pmid = 18971159 | url = http://ajws.elsevier.com/ajws3/abstract.asp?art_id=5002&art_journals=12 | accessdate  = 2009-03-03 | doi = 10.1016/S0929-6646(08)60206-5}}</ref>  The typical size is approximately 1 centimeter, but sizes ranging from a few millimeters up to 2–3 centimeters are not uncommon.<ref name=ggayer />

[[Splenogonadal fusion]] can result in one or more accessory spleens along a path from the abdomen into the [[pelvis]] or [[scrotum]].  The developing spleen forms near the [[urogenital folds|urogenital ridge]] from which the gonads develop. The gonads may pick up some tissue from the spleen, and as they descend through the abdomen during development, they can produce either a continuous or a broken line of deposited splenic tissue.<ref name=slchen />

Splenosis is a condition where foci of splenic tissue undergo [[autotransplantation]], most often following [[physical trauma]] or [[splenectomy]].  Displaced tissue fragments can implant on well vascularized surfaces in the abdominal cavity, or, if the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragmatic]] barrier is broken, the [[chest|thorax]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Abu Hilal M | coauthors = Harb A, Zeidan B, Steadman B, Primrose JN, Pearce NW | date = January 5, 2009 | title = Hepatic splenosis mimicking HCC in a patient with hepatitis C liver cirrhosis and mildly raised alpha feto protein; the important role of explorative laparoscopy | journal = World Journal of Surgical Oncology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | publisher = BioMed Central | location = England | pmid = 19123935 | pmc = 2630926 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7819-7-1

==Significance==
If splenectomy is performed for conditions in which blood cells are sequestered in the spleen, failure to remove accessory spleens may result in the failure of the condition to resolve.<ref name=klmoore /> During [[medical imaging]], accessory spleens may be confused for a enlarged lymph nodes or [[neoplasm|neoplastic growth]] in the tail of the pancreas,<ref name=shkim /> gastrointestinal tract, [[adrenal gland]]s or gonads.<ref name=ggayer />
