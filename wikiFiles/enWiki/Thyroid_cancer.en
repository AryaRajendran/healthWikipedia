'''Thyroid cancer''' is a [[malignant]] [[thyroid neoplasm]] originating from follicular or parafollicular [[thyroid]] cells.

==Symptoms==
[[Image:Lymph node with papillary thyroid carcinoma.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Micrograph of a [[lymph node]] with [[papillary thyroid carcinoma]].]]
Most often the first symptom of thyroid cancer is a nodule in the thyroid region of the neck.<ref name=hu>Hu MI, Vassilopoulou-Sellin R, Lustig R, Lamont JP. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter05/article/10165/1402668 "Thyroid and Parathyroid Cancers"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref> However, many adults have small nodules in their thyroids, but typically under 5% of these nodules are found to be malignant. Sometimes the first sign is an enlarged lymph node. Later symptoms that can be present are pain in the anterior region of the neck and changes in voice due to an involvement of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]]. 

Thyroid cancer is usually found in a [[euthyroid]] patient, but symptoms of [[hyperthyroidism]] or [[hypothyroidism]] may be associated with a large or metastatic well-differentiated tumor.

[[Thyroid nodules]] are of particular concern when they are found in those under the age of 20. The presentation of benign nodules at this age is less likely, and thus the potential for malignancy is far greater.

==Diagnosis==
{{Further|Thyroid nodule}}
After a [[thyroid nodule]] is found during a physical examination, a referral to an [[endocrinologist]], or a [[thyroidologist]] may occur. Most commonly an [[ultrasound]] is performed to confirm the presence of a nodule, and assess the status of the whole gland. Measurement of [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] and anti-thyroid antibodies will help decide if there is a functional thyroid disease such as [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] present, a known cause of a benign nodular goiter.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bennedbaek FN, Perrild H, Hegedüs L |title=Diagnosis and treatment of the solitary thyroid nodule.

Finally, to achieve a definitive diagnosis before deciding on treatment, a [[fine needle aspiration cytology]] test is usually performed.

==Classification==
Thyroid cancers can be classified according to their [[histopathological]] characteristics.<ref name="titleThyroid Cancer Treatment - National Cancer Institute">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/thyroid/HealthProfessional/page2 |title=Thyroid Cancer Treatment – National Cancer Institute |accessdate=2007-12-22 |format= |work=}}</ref><ref name="titleThyroid cancer">{{cite web |url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cancernet/101252.html#2_CELLULARCLASSIFICATION |title=Thyroid cancer |accessdate=2007-12-22 |format= |work=}}</ref> The following variants can be distinguished (distribution over various subtypes may show regional variation):

==Etiology==
From the 1940s to 1960s, external, low-dose radiation to the head and neck during infancy and childhood was used to treat many benign diseases. This type of therapy has been shown to predispose persons to thyroid cancer. The younger the patient was at time of exposure, the higher the risk of developing cancer.<ref name=hu/>

Another cause may be due to high-dose irradiation to the head and neck. Patients with [[Hodgkin lymphoma]] treated with mantlefield irradiation have an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer, although hypothyroidism is more likely.<ref name=hu/>

==Detection of metastases==
Detection of any metastases of thyroid cancer can be performed with a full body [[scintigraphy]] using [[iodine-131]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1677/ERC-07-0120}} [http://erc.endocrinology-journals.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/3/799]</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|3183748}} [http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/29/11/1790.pdf]</ref>

==Treatment==
Some kinds of thyroid cancer are very common in older adults, very slow growing, produce no symptoms, and require no treatment.  Treating these patients for a cancer that will not produce any symptoms before their natural death from other causes represents [[overdiagnosis]] and [[overtreatment]] with no benefits to the patient.<ref name="WelchSchwartz2011">{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=H.

Thyroid cancer may require surgery. Common surgeries include [[thyroidectomy]] and [[lobectomy]].<ref name=hu/>

Radioactive [[Iodine-131]] is used in patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer for ablation of residual thyroid tissue after surgery and for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Patients with medullary, anaplastic, and most Hurthle cell cancers do not benefit from this therapy.<ref name=hu/>

External irradiation may be used when the cancer is unresectable, when it recurs after resection, or to relieve pain from [[bone metastasis]].<ref name=hu/>

[[Sorafenib]] and [[sunitinib]], approved for other indications show promise for thyroid cancer and are being used for some patients who do not qualify for clinical trials.<ref name=Sherman2009>{{cite journal |url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/94/5/1493 |title=Advances in Chemotherapy of Differentiated Epithelial and Medullary Thyroid Cancers |author=Sherman |year=2009 |doi=10.1210/jc.2008-0923 |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism |volume=94 |pages=1493–1499 |issue=5 }}</ref> Numerous agents are in phase II clinical trials and [[XL184]] has started a phase III trial.<ref name=Sherman2009/>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of thyroid cancer is related to the type of cancer and the stage at the time of diagnosis.  For the most common form of thyroid cancer, papillary, the overall prognosis is excellent. Indeed, the increased incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma in recent years is likely related to increased and earlier diagnosis. One can look at the trend to earlier diagnosis in two ways. The first is that many of these cancers are small and not likely to develop into aggressive malignancies. A second perspective is that earlier diagnosis removes these cancers at a time when they are not likely to have spread beyond the thyroid gland, thereby improving the long-term outcome for the patient. There is no consensus at present on whether this trend toward earlier diagnosis is beneficial or unnecessary. 

The argument against early diagnosis and treatment is based on the logic that many small thyroid cancers (mostly papillary) will not grow or metastasize. This viewpoint holds the overwhelming majority of thyroid cancers are [[overdiagnosed]] (that is, will never cause any symptoms, illness, or death for the patient, even if nothing is ever done about the cancer).  Including these overdiagnosed cases skews the statistics by lumping clinically significant cases in with apparently harmless cancers.<ref name=Welch />  Thyroid cancer is incredibly common, with [[autopsy]] studies of people dying from other causes showing that more than one third of older adults technically has thyroid cancer, which is causing them no harm.<ref name=Welch />  It is easy to detect nodules that might be cancerous, simply by feeling the throat, which contributes to the level of overdiagnosis.  However, very few of the people with these accidentally discovered, symptom-free thyroid cancers will ever have any symptoms, and treatment in such patients has only the potential to harm them, not to help them.<ref name=Welch>{{cite book

Thyroid cancer is three times more common in women than in men, but according to <ref>{{cite web|title=Thyroid Cancer|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/thyroid_cancer/article.htm|publisher=MedicineNet.com|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref> European statistics, the overall relative [[5-year survival rate]] for thyroid cancer is 85% for females and 74% for males.<ref name=european>Numbers from EUROCARE, from [http://books.google.se/books?id=u1aFpF-EcgwC&pg=PA10 Page 10] in: {{cite book |author=F. Grünwald; Biersack, H. J.; Grںunwald, F. |title=Thyroid cancer |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=3-540-22309-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The table below highlights some of the challenges with decision making and prognostication in thyroid cancer. While there is general agreement that stage I or II papillary, follicular or medullary cancer have a good prognosis, it is not possible when evaluating a small thyroid cancer to determine which ones will grow and metastasize and which will not. As a result once a diagnosis of thyroid cancer has been established (most commonly by a fine needle aspiration), it is likely that a total thyroidectomy will be performed.

This drive to earlier diagnosis has also manifest itself on the European continent by the use of serum calcitonin measurements in patients with goiter to identify patients with early abnormalities of the parafollicular or calcitonin-producing cells within the thyroid gland. As multiple studies have demonstrated, the finding of an elevated serum calcitonin is associated with the finding of a medullary thyroid carcinoma in as high as 20% of cases.

Does the finding of a small medullary thyroid carcinoma (which may lie dormant) justify the performance of a total thyroidectomy (it's necessary to perform total thyroidectomy because the medullary thyroid carcinomas identified may be microscopic and not identified by imaging or evaluation of the thyroid gland at the time of surgery) with its attendant risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism (low calcium) and damage to the nerves innervating the vocal cords (causing permanent hoarseness in 2-4% of patients)?

In Europe where the threshold for thyroid surgery is lower than in the United States, an elaborate strategy that incorporates serum calcitonin measurements and stimulatory tests for calcitonin has been incorporated into the decision to perform a thyroidectomy; thyroid experts in the USA, looking at the same data sets have, for the most part, not incorporated calcitonin testing as a routine part of their evaluation, thereby eliminating a large number of thyroidectomies and the consequent morbidity. The European thyroid community has focused on prevention of metastasis from small medullary thyroid carcinomas; the North American thyroid community has focused more on prevention of complications associated with thyroidectomy (see [[American Thyroid Association]] guidelines below). It is not clear at this time who is correct.

As demonstrated in the Table below, individuals with stage III and IV disease have a significant risk of dying from thyroid cancer. While many present with widely metastatic disease, an equal number evolve over years and decades from stage I or II disease. Physicians who manage thyroid cancer of any stage recognize that a small percentage of patients with low-risk thyroid cancer will progress to metastatic disease.

Fortunately for those with metastatic thyroid cancer, the last 5 years has brought about a renaissance in thyroid cancer treatment. The identification of some of the molecular or DNA abnormalities for thyroid cancer has led to the development of therapies that target these molecular defects. The first of these agents to negotiate the approval process is [[vandetanib]], a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the [[RET proto-oncogene]], 2 subtypes of the [[vascular endothelial growth factor receptor]], and the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm250168.htm|title=FDA approves new treatment for rare form of thyroid cancer|accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref>  More of these compounds are under investigation and are likely to make it through the approval process. For differentiated thyroid carcinoma, strategies are evolving to use selected types of targeted therapy to increase radioactive iodine uptake in papillary thyroid carcinomas that have lost the ability to concentrate iodide. This strategy would make it possible to use radioactive iodine therapy to treat "resistant" thyroid cancers. Other targeted therapies are being evaluated, making it possible that life will be extended over the next 5–10 years for those with stage III and IV thyroid cancer.

Prognosis is better in younger people than older ones.<ref name=european/>

Prognosis depends mainly on the type of cancer and [[cancer stage]].
