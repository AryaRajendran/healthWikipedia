The '''paramedian pontine reticular formation''', or '''PPRF''', is part of the pontine [[reticular formation]], a [[brain]] region without clearly defined borders in the center of the [[pons]]. It is involved in the coordination of [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]], particularly horizontal gaze and [[saccade]]s.

== Input, Output, and Function ==
The PPRF is located [[anatomical terms of location|anterior]] and lateral to the [[medial longitudinal fasciculus]] (MLF). It receives input from the [[superior colliculus]] via the predorsal bundle and from the [[Brodmann area 8|frontal eye fields]] via [[frontopontine fibers]]. The rostral PPRF probably coordinates vertical saccades; the caudal PPRF may be the generator of horizontal saccades. In particular, activity of the excitatory burst [[neuron]]s (EBNs) in the PPRF generates the "pulse" movement that initiates a saccade. In the case of horizontal saccades the "pulse" information is conveyed via [[axon]]al fibers to the [[abducens nucleus]], initiating lateral [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]]. The [[angular velocity]] of the eye during horizontal saccade ranges from 100 to 700 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s per second. Larger saccades have faster pulses; the PPRF is involved in this determination.{{ref|Brazis}}

==Lesions==
Unilateral [[lesion]]s of the PPRF produce characteristic findings:{{ref|Zee}}
* Loss of horizontal saccades directed towards the side of the lesion, no matter the current position of gaze
* Contralateral gaze deviation (acute lesions, such as early [[stroke]], only)
* Gaze-evoked lateral [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] on looking away from the side of the lesion
Bilateral lesions produce [[ophthalmoparesis|horizontal gaze palsy]] and slowing of vertical saccades
