[[File:Decompression chamber.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Photograph of the cramped interior of a cylinder containing two benches and two diver trainees|A [[recompression chamber]] is used to treat some diving disorders, and for training divers to recognise the symptoms.]]
[[Diving disorders]] are [[medical conditions]] specifically arising from [[underwater diving]]. The [[Medical sign|signs]] and [[symptoms]] of these may present during a dive, on surfacing, or up to several hours after a dive. [[Scuba diving|Divers]] have to breathe a gas which is at the same pressure as their surroundings ([[ambient pressure]]), which can be much greater than on the surface. The ambient pressure underwater increases by {{convert|1|atm|kPa|lk=in}} for every {{convert|10|m|ft}} of depth.<ref name="BE9" />

The principal conditions are: [[decompression illness]] (which covers [[decompression sickness]] and [[arterial gas embolism]]); [[nitrogen narcosis]]; [[high pressure nervous syndrome]]; [[oxygen toxicity]]; and [[pulmonary barotrauma]] (burst lung). Although some of these may occur in other settings, they are of particular concern during diving activities.<ref name="BE9" />

The disorders are caused by [[breathing gas]] at the high pressures encountered at depth, and divers will often breathe a gas mixture different from air to mitigate these effects. [[Nitrox]], which contains more [[oxygen]] and less [[nitrogen]] is commonly used as a breathing gas to reduce the risk of decompression sickness at [[Recreational diving|recreational depths]] (up to about {{convert|40|m|ft}}). [[Helium]] may be added to reduce the amount of nitrogen and oxygen in the gas mixture when diving deeper, to reduce the effects of narcosis and to avoid the risk of oxygen toxicity. This is complicated at depths beyond about {{convert|150|m|ft|-2}}, because a helium–oxygen mixture ([[heliox]]) then causes high pressure nervous syndrome.<ref name="BE9" /> More exotic mixtures such as [[hydreliox]], a hydrogen–helium–oxygen mixture, are used at extreme depths to counteract this.<ref name="Abraini1994" />

== Decompression sickness ==
[[File:Nasa decompression chamber.jpg|thumb|alt=A large horizontal cylinder with a bank of instruments and monitors|The recompression chamber at the [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]] used for treating DCS and training]]
[[Decompression sickness]] (DCS) occurs when gas, which has been breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the [[Tissue (biology)|body tissues]], forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an [[artery]] leading to damage to the [[nervous system]], [[paralysis]] or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the [[U.S. Navy]], with [[neurological]] symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. [[Pulmonary]] DCS is very rare in divers.<ref name="Powell-p70" /> The table below classifies the effects by affected organ and bubble location.<ref name="BE10-6" />

== Arterial gas embolism and pulmonary barotrauma ==
[[File:Illu pulmonary circuit.jpg|thumb|400px|alt=Diagram showing the four chambers of the heart and the pulmonary arteries and veins connecting it to both lungs|The pulmonary circulation]]
If the compressed air in a diver's [[lungs]] cannot freely escape during an ascent, particularly a rapid one, then the lung tissues may rupture, causing [[pulmonary barotrauma]] (PBT). The air may then enter the [[Circulatory system|arterial circulation]] producing [[arterial gas embolism]] (AGE), with effects similar to severe [[decompression sickness]].<ref name="BE10-5-p557" /> Although AGE may occur as a result of other causes, it is most often secondary to PBT. AGE is the second most common cause of death while diving ([[drowning]] being the most common stated cause of death). Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. The following table presents those signs and symptoms which have been observed in more than ten percent of cases diagnosed as AGE, with approximate estimates of frequency.<ref name="BE10-5-p568" />

== Nitrogen narcosis ==
[[File:Console-narc.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The central area shows an LCD display clearly, but it becomes increasingly grayed out away from the centre |Narcosis can produce tunnel vision, making it difficult to read multiple gauges.]]
[[Nitrogen narcosis]] is caused by the pressure of dissolved gas in the body and produces [[wikt:impairment|impairment]] to the [[nervous system]]. This results in alteration to thought processes and a decrease in the diver's ability to make judgements or calculations. It can also decrease [[motor skills]], and worsen performance in tasks requiring [[manual dexterity]]. As depth increases, so does the pressure and hence the severity of the narcosis. The effects may vary widely from individual to individual, and from day to day for the same diver. Because of the perception-altering effects of narcosis, a diver may not be aware of the symptoms, but studies have shown that impairment occurs nevertheless.<ref name="BE9-2-p301" /> Since the choice of breathing gas also affects the depth at which narcosis occurs, the table below represents typical manifestations when breathing air.<ref name="LM2005-p105" />

== High pressure nervous syndrome ==
[[File:EEG cap.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of a subject's head with numerous small sensors covering the forehead, neck and scalp|An EEG recording net]]
[[Helium]] is the least [[narcotic]] of all gases, and divers may use [[Breathing gas|breathing mixtures]] containing a proportion of helium for dives exceeding about {{convert|40|m|ft}} deep. In the 1960s it was expected that helium narcosis would begin to become apparent at depths of {{convert|300|m|ft|-2}}. However, it was found that different symptoms, such as [[tremors]], occurred at shallower depths around {{convert|150|m|ft|-2}}. This became known as [[high pressure nervous syndrome]], and its effects are found to result from both the absolute depth and the speed of descent. Although the effects vary from person to person, they are stable and reproducible for each individual; the list below summarises the symptoms observed underwater and in studies using simulated dives in the dry, using [[recompression chamber]]s and [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) monitors.<ref name="BE9-3-p323" />

{| class="wikitable plainrowheaders"
|+ Signs and symptoms of HPNS
|-
! scope="col" | Symptom

! scope="row" | Impairment
| Both intellectual and [[motor coordination|motor performance]] are [[wikt:impairment|impaired]]. A 20% decrease in the ability to perform calculations and in [[manual dexterity]] is observed at {{convert|180|m|ft|-2}}, rising to 40% at depths of {{convert|240|m|ft|-2}}
|-
! scope="row" | Dizziness
| [[Vertigo]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]] may occur in divers at depths of {{convert|180|m|ft|-2}}. Animal studies under more extreme conditions have produced [[convulsions]].
|-
! scope="row" | Tremors
| [[Tremors]] of the hands, arms and torso are observed from {{convert|130|m|ft|-2}} onward. The tremors occur with a frequency in the range of 5–8&nbsp;[[hertz]] (Hz), and their severity is related to the speed of compression; the tremors reduce and may disappear when the pressure has stabilised.
|-
! scope="row" | {{nowrap|EEG changes}}
| At depths exceeding {{convert|300|m|ft|-2}}, changes in the [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) are observed; the appearance of [[theta waves]] (4–6&nbsp;Hz) and depression of [[alpha waves]] (8–13&nbsp;Hz).
|-
! scope="row" | Somnolence
| At depths beyond the onset of EEG changes, test subjects intermittently [[Somnolence|fall asleep]], with [[sleep stage]]s 1 and 2 observed in the EEG. Even when decompressed to shallower depths, the effect continues for 10–12 hours.

== Oxygen toxicity ==
{{Further|Oxygen toxicity}}
[[File:File-Oxygen toxicity testing.jpeg|thumb|alt=Three people are sitting inside a small enclosure|During [[World War II]] Professor Kenneth Donald carried out extensive testing for oxygen toxicity in divers. The chamber is pressurised with air to {{convert|3.7|bar|kPa psi}}. The subject in the centre is breathing 100% oxygen from a mask.]]
Although [[oxygen]] is essential to life, in concentrations greater than normal it becomes [[toxic]], overcoming the body's natural defences ([[antioxidants]]), and causing [[Necrosis|cell death]] in any part of the body. The [[lungs]] and [[brain]] are particularly affected by high [[partial pressures]] of oxygen, such as are encountered in diving. The body can tolerate partial pressures of oxygen around {{convert|0.5|bar|kPa psi|lk=in}} indefinitely, and up to {{convert|1.4|bar|kPa psi}} for many hours, but higher partial pressures rapidly increase the chance of the most dangerous effect of [[oxygen toxicity]], a [[convulsion]] resembling an [[epileptic seizure]].<ref name="BE9-4-358" /> [[Susceptible individual|Susceptibility]] to oxygen toxicity varies dramatically from person to person, and to a much smaller extent from day to day for the same diver.<ref name="BE9-4-376" /> Prior to convulsion, several symptoms may be present&nbsp;– most distinctly that of an [[Aura (symptom)|aura]].

During 1942 and 1943, Professor Kenneth W Donald, working at the Admiralty Experimental Diving Unit, carried out over 2,000 experiments on divers to examine the effects of oxygen toxicity. To date, no comparable series of studies has been performed. In one seminal experiment, Donald exposed 36 healthy divers to {{convert|3.7|bar|kPa psi}} of oxygen in a chamber, equivalent to breathing pure oxygen at a depth of {{convert|27|m|ft|-1}}, and recorded the time of onset of various signs and symptoms. Five of the subjects convulsed, and the others recovered when returned to normal pressure following the appearance of acute symptoms. The table below summarises the results for the relative frequency of the symptoms, and the earliest and latest time of onset, as observed by Donald. The wide variety of symptoms and large variability of onset between individuals typical of oxygen toxicity are clearly illustrated.<ref name="Donald-1" />
