In the anatomy of the [[female reproductive system]], the '''canal of the cervix''' (also called the '''endocervical canal''', '''cervical canal''', '''cervical canal of uterus''', or the '''cavity of cervix''') is the spindle-shaped, flattened canal of the [[cervix]], the neck of the [[uterus]].

It communicates with the [[cavity of the body of the uterus|uterine cavity]] via the [[internal orifice of the uterus]], and with the [[vagina]] via the [[external orifice of the uterus|external orifice]].

The wall of the canal presents an anterior and a posterior longitudinal ridge, from each of which proceed a number of small oblique columns, the ''palmate folds'', giving the appearance of branches from the stem of a tree; to this arrangement the name ''arbor vitæ uteri'' is applied. 

The folds on the two walls are not exactly opposed, but fit between one another so as to close the cervical canal.

The endocervical mucosa is a site from which [[adenocarcinoma]] can arise.  Endocervical adenocarcinoma, like cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma), often arises in the [[Social environment|milieu]] of [[human papilloma virus]] infection.<ref name=pmid2067992>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Yeh | first1 = IT. | last2 = LiVolsi | first2 = VA. | last3 = Noumoff | first3 = JS. | title = Endocervical carcinoma. | journal = Pathol Res Pract | volume = 187 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 129–44 | month = Mar | year = 1991 | doi =  | PMID = 2067992 }}</ref> 

As most [[endometrial cancer]]s are adenocarcinomas, differentiation of endocervical adenocarcinoma and endometrial adenocarcinomas is required, as the treatment differs.  [[Immunohistochemical staining]] is often helpful in this regard, endocervical adenocarcinomas are typically [[Carcinoembryonic antigen|CEA]] and [[p16]] positive and [[estrogen receptor]], [[progesterone receptor]] and [[vimentin]] negative.
