The '''Los Angeles fetus disposal scandal''' was the 1982 discovery of over 16,000 aborted fetuses being improperly stored at Malvin Weisberg's [[Woodland Hills, California|Woodland Hills]], California home and the ensuing legal battle regarding their disposal. It was called a "national tragedy" by the then-president [[Ronald Reagan]] and inspired a song by pop singer [[Pat Boone]], with the fetuses finally buried in 1985. No criminal charges were filed against any of the parties involved.<ref name="sac-bee">{{cite news|last=Raimundo|first=Jeff|title=High court stymies LA burial of fetuses|date=March 19, 1985}}</ref> Weisberg had stored the specimens properly but had not disposed of them due to financial difficulties.<ref name="sac-bee"/>

Malvin Weisberg had operated Medical Analytic Laboratories in [[Santa Monica]] from 1976 until March 1981.<ref name="secret">{{cite news|title=Secret Meeting Set in Fetus Discovery Case|last=Blake|first=Gene|date=11 February 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=SD_A13|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Meeting on Fetuses|date=18 February 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=D4|accessdate=6 June 2011}}</ref> He purchased a 20-foot (6.1 m) [[Intermodal container|storage container]] in 1980, delivering it to his Woodland Hills home and paying for it with a [[Non-sufficient funds|bounced check]] for $1700.<ref name="secret" /><ref name="fivehundred" /> The container was repossessed on February 3, 1982 by the [[Martin Container Company]], based in the [[Wilmington, Los Angeles|Wilmington]] area of Los Angeles.<ref name="fivehundred" /> Martin Container opened the container on the following day, discovering the fetuses, which were stored in [[formaldehyde]].<ref name="fivehundred" />

The tally of fetuses was estimated at "up to 17,000" in May 1982,<ref name="each" /> and was later finally set at 16,431.<ref name="charges" /> A count of 193 fetuses were evidently over 20 weeks' [[gestation]], with the oldest almost 30 weeks.<ref name="charges" />

State law required the fetuses to be cremated or buried "within a reasonable time".<ref name="depol" />

==Source and age of the fetuses==
The fetuses were aborted by licensed physicians, clinics and hospitals who contracted Medical Analytic Laboratories for pathology testing and disposal of the fetuses.<ref name="charges" /><ref name="court" />

The [[Los Angeles County District Attorney]], [[John Van de Kamp]],<!-- note Wikipedia states Van de Kamp would have only been in office until 1981, though several articles state he was in office through at least the beginning of the 1982 discovery --> said the fetuses would be individually examined and charges would be filed against the doctors if fetuses were over the 20-week [[gestation]] limit allowed by California law at the time.<ref name="charges" /><ref name="prosecute" /> Officials found 193 fetuses that appeared to be over the 20-week limit.<ref name="charges" /> Van de Kamp wanted to turn the remaining fetuses over to groups who would perform memorial services on them.<ref name="charges" />

In May 1982, [[California Attorney General]] [[George Deukmejian]] stated the gestation limit of the 1967 California abortion law was considered unenforceable because of conflicts with the 23-week [[Roe v. Wade]] ruling in 1973, but fetuses could be individually examined to determine viability, which was the legal limit.<ref name="charges" /><ref name="prosecute" /><ref name="deukmejian">{{cite news|title=Abortion Prosecution Possible-Deukmejian: Opinion Clears Way for Van de Kamp to File Charges in Woodland Hills Case|last=Ingram|first=Carl|coauthors=Jacobs, Paul|date=11 May 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=OC_A1|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> In late May, Van de Kamp stated every fetus would be examined to determine if the fetus was aborted illegally.<ref name="each">{{cite news|title=Each Stored Fetus to Be Examined: L.A.

==Legal action==
In 1982 president [[Ronald Reagan]] wrote a letter advocating for memorial services "for these children", referring to it as "this national tragedy".<ref name="court">{{cite news|title=Court Clears the Way for Disposal of Fetuses|last=Hager|first=Philip|date=19 March 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=SD3|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref>

The matter came in front of the judge because of a lawsuit filed against Van de Kamp by [[Carol Downer]] of the [[Los Angeles Feminist Women's Health Center]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. John Lynch, the chief deputy county counsel stated it was inappropriate to enjoin Van de Kamp, who was simply a "man in the middle", and that the lawsuit should be filed against pro-choice groups instead.<ref name="release" /> In June 1982, [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] judge [[Dickran Tevrizian]] issued a [[temporary restraining order]]<!-- another source calls it VdK as being 'enjoined' --> against Van de Kamp to prevent the unconstitutional release of the fetuses to groups for burial, but allowed him to legally dispose of the fetuses, called "vague" by John Lynch, the chief deputy county counsel.<ref name="depol">{{cite news|title=Depoliticizing the Fetuses|date=11 June 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=D6|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="release">{{cite news|title=Release of Fetuses for Rites Prohibited: Judge's Injunction Forbids Van de Kamp to Allow Their Use in Religious Services|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|date=23 June 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=B3|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> 

In October 1982, Van de Kamp petitioned the court to allow the burial of all but the 193 late-term fetuses in [[Mass grave|common graves]] at [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]], which offered free burial.<ref name="charges" /><ref name="permission">{{cite news|title=Permission Sought for Burial of Fetuses|last=Rohrlich|first=Ted|date=1 October 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=OC_A4|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> The fetuses were not buried at Valhalla, which later stated it offered the burial plot because "the right-to-life groups came to us, and we said we wouldn't endorse any political viewpoint, but we thought that interring the bodies was a proper thing to do as a service".<ref>{{cite news|title=Valhalla Cemetery Records History of Famous, Forgotten|last=Bloom|first=Stephen|date=2 September 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=V_A6|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref>

In December 1982, [[Los Angeles Superior Court]] judge Eli Chernow ruled the 20-week limit was unconstitutional, also ruling that Van de Kamp could bury the fetuses and [[pro-life]] groups could hold onsite memorial services.<ref>{{cite news|title=Judge Rejects Abortion Bar at 20 Weeks|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|date=22 December 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=A1|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref>

By July 1983, the district attorney was [[Robert Philibosian]], who stated he preferred a "dignified burial" and would not file charges.<ref name="charges">{{cite news|title=D.A.

In July 1984, the [[California Courts of Appeal]] overturned [[Superior Court of Los Angeles County]] judge Eli Chernow, ruling the fetuses could not be buried as human remains, which was a win for [[pro-choice]] groups and feminists. The case had been appealed by [[Carol Downer]] of the [[Los Angeles Feminist Women's Health Center]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and was denounced by the California Pro-Life Medical Association, the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]]. The appealing parties argued that allowing [[Pro-life movement|pro-life]] groups to bury the remains violated the [[separation of church and state]]. The Court's opinion stated "it is clear from the record that the Catholic League is a religious organization which regards a fetus as a human being and abortion as murder. While this specific belief may well cross sectarian lines... any state action showing a preference for this belief will be strictly scrutinized and must be invalidated". Since fetal remains are normally incinerated without ceremony, there was no reason to do otherwise with these fetuses, stating "We perceive that the intended burial ceremony will enlist the prestige and power of the state. This is constitutionally forbidden." However, religious services could hold concurrent onsite memorial services, which was praised by US president [[Ronald Reagan]] in a letter to the California Pro-Life Medical Association, admiring their decision "to hold a memorial service for these children".<ref name="prosecute" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Appeal Court Bars Disputed Plan to Bury 16,000 Fetuses|last=Blake|first=Gene|date=3 July 1984|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=C1|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="rehnquist" /> Philibosian announced he would appeal the ruling allowing onsite memorial services.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Region|date=10 July 1984|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=SD2|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="issue">{{cite news|title=County Will Take Fetus Issue to U.S. High Court|last=Hernandez|first=Marita|date=28 September 1984|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=D1|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> In October 1984, [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justice [[William Rehnquist]] refused to turn over the state appeals court ruling allowing the religious ceremonies.<ref name="rehnquist">{{cite news|title=The Region: U.S. Supreme Court...|date=12 October 1984|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=OC2|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> This was officially upheld by the Supreme Court in March 1985.<ref>{{cite news|title=L.A.

==Pro-life service==
In May 1985, singer [[Pat Boone]] announced he recorded a song titled "Sixteen Thousand Faces" about the incident, first played at an pro-life memorial service for the fetuses at [[Live Oak Memorial Park]] in [[Monrovia, California|Monrovia]], where a granite tombstone was left with the inscription "For all those deprived of life and human love through abortion". In response, the California [[Abortion Rights Action League]] director said the service and marker "[humanized] fetuses when they deny the humanity of women already born".<ref>{{cite news|title=Boone Song Inspired by Fetus Protest|date=14 May 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=OC17|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Fetuses Left Unburied Prompt Song by Pat Boone|last=Jalon|first=Allan|date=14 May 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=V_A6|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> The ceremony was attended by "several hundred anti-abortionists", including Representative [[Bob Dornan]] and the [[Feminists for Life]] group.

==Disposal==
In August 1985, the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]] ordered the fetuses be turned over to the Guerra-Gutirrez-Alexander Mortuary for burial.<ref name="gga" /> Per the court's order, the mortuary was selected because they didn't have a religious affiliation.<ref name="challenges" /> At the time, it was noted by the [[Los Angeles County Department of Health Services]] that the fetuses had been kept in "five pine boxes". The department assured ACLU that there were no identifying marks on canisters containing the fetuses, and ACLU stated they would not object to a secular burial.<ref name="gga">{{cite news|title=County Orders Burial of Controversial Fetuses|last=McGarry|first=T.W.|date=28 August 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=V_A6|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> While ACLU would not object, the Feminist Women's Health Center petitioned the Los Angeles Superior Court to block the burial, but the courts refused.<ref name="challenges">{{cite news|title=Feminist Center Challenges Planned Burial of Fetuses|last=Townsend|first=Dorothy|date=14 September 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=V_A8|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref>

The disposal occurred on October 6, 1985, with the fetuses in six pine boxes, which were buried at the [[Odd Fellows Cemetery (Los Angeles, California)|Odd Fellows Cemetery]] in [[Boyle Heights]]. The pro-life group Feminists for Life didn't plan a full memorial service since they held a service in May, but the Americans Committed to Loving the Unwanted held a service. The Feminist Women's Health Center was dismayed over the public burial.<ref>{{cite news|title=Controversial Fetuses to Be Buried Oct. 6: 3-Year Battle Over Interment to End in East L.A. Cemetery|last=Jalon|first=Allan|date=29 September 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=SD25|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> About 250 individuals attended the service, including [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors|County Supervisor]] [[Michael D. Antonovich]], who read a message from Ronald Reagan but stressed his attendance was in an unofficial capacity. Reagan's message stated "Just as the terrible toll of Gettysburg can be traced to a tragic decision of a divided Supreme Court, so also can these deaths we mourn. Once again a whole category of human beings has been ruled outside the protection of the law by a court ruling which clashed with our deepest moral convictions." Others in attendance were Representative [[Bob Dornan]], state Senate President [[David A. Roberti]], and state Representative [[Joseph Montoya (California)|Joseph Montoya]]. The pro-life group Americans Committed to Loving the Unwanted organized the service, including requesting a three-man Marine Corps [[color guard]], who placed an [[American Flag]] on a box and stood at attention throughout the service.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fetuses Buried-With Hymns, Prayers|last=McGarry|first=TW|date=7 October 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=A3|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1985-10-07/news/0330340020_1_aborted-fetuses-supreme-court-tabernacle-of-faith|title=Aborted Fetuses Get Religious Burial Reagan Sends Message To Ceremony In Los Angeles|last=|first=|date=7 October 1985|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref>

The following day, the Marine Corps said they were tricked, that the [[color guard]] was in attendance for the death of a [[Vietnam Veteran]], not the fetuses.<ref name="tricked" /><ref name="misled" /> The three marines signed statements indicating Jeanette Dreisbach of Palm Springs was organizing the religious-themed ceremony.<ref name="tricked">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Qv5NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zosDAAAAIBAJ&dq=mass%20fetus%20burial&pg=3802%2C4099379|title=Marines tricked on fetus funeral (AP)|date=8 October 1985|work=[[The Free Lanceâ€“Star]]|accessdate=8 June 2011|location=Los Angeles}}</ref><ref name="misled">{{cite news|title=Marines Say They Were Misled on Fetus Burial Role|last=McGarry|first=TW|date=8 October 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=B1|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> A spokesperson for the Marines stated "this organization used the false pretense of the burial of a veteran to mislead our Marines into attending this event."<ref name="tricked" /> Driesbach denied misleading the Marines.<ref name="tricked" />

==Financial fallout==
Weisberg's Medical Analytical Laboratories received nearly $175,000 in [[Medi-Cal]] payments, with $88,000 coming from pathology tests on aborted fetuses. Of this, half of it ($44,000) was paid federally through the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). By the [[Hyde Amendment]], this money was ineligible for testing on pre-abortion or post-abortion tissue, which meant the state of California would need to pay back federal funds claimed by Weisberg and by any other laboratories, according to HHS inspector Richard P. Kusserow. Kusserow also stated "prior to its closing in April, 1981, [Medical Analytical Laboratories] had routinely submitted questionable billings under the Medi-Cal program, using an erroneous billing code.... the case lacked criminal prosecutive merit due to a lack of proof that the false billings were intentional. Because the laboratory was out of business, and its owner had declared bankruptcy, there were no assets against which to proceed for civil recovery".<ref name="hhs">{{cite news|title=State May Owe U.S. Millions for Tests on Fetuses|last=Jackson|first=Robert|date=29 May 1983|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=A12|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref>
