'''Rectal foreign bodies''' are large [[Foreign body|foreign items]] found in the [[rectum]] that can be assumed to have been inserted through the anus, rather than reaching the rectum via the mouth and gastrointestinal tract.  Smaller, ingested foreign bodies, such as bones eaten with food, can sometimes be found stuck in the rectum upon x-ray.

Rectal foreign bodies, and amateur attempts to remove them, can result in [[gastrointestinal perforation|perforation of the bowel]], which is a life-threatening [[medical emergency]].  Medical literature covers examples of items retrieved from patients' rectums. Rectal foreign objects are also the subject of a number of [[urban legend]]s.
