{{Psychiatry in Russia and the USSR}}
The '''Russian Mental Health Law''' (known also under its official name—the Law of the Russian Federation “On Psychiatric Care and Guarantees of Citizens’ Rights during Its Provision”) is the basic legal act that regulates organizational and legal principles of psychiatric care in the [[Russian Federation]]. The Law passed on 2 July 1992 and received the number 3185-1.<ref name="Ковалев">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last=Ковалев|first=А.А.|title=Взгляд очевидца на предысторию принятия закона о психиатрической помощи |journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2007|issue=№ 3|pages=82–90|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2007/3/view.htm|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref><ref name="Закон">{{ru icon}} {{cite web|title=Закон Российской Федерации «О психиатрической помощи и гарантиях прав граждан при ее оказании» от 02.07.1992 г. №3185-I|publisher=The [[State Duma of the Russian Federation]], the Department of Law|url=http://ntc.duma.gov.ru/duma_na/asozd/asozd_text.php?code=7971|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref>

== History ==
The Soviet State never considered it reasonable to pass special legislative acts protecting the material and legal part of the patients’ life.<ref name="Koryagin">{{cite journal|last=Koryagin|first=Anatoliy|authorlink=Anatoly Koryagin|title=Compulsion in psychiatry: blessing or curse?|journal=Psychiatric Bulletin|year=1990|volume=14|issue=7|pages=394–398|doi=10.1192/pb.14.7.394|url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/14/7/394.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> It was only instructions of the legal and medical departments that stipulated certain rules of handling the mentally sick and imposing different sanctions on them.<ref name="Koryagin"/>

In Russia, the enactment of its Mental Health Law took place under dramatic circumstances despite the need for the Law because of an 80 year delay, after which the Law passed by Russia as against all developed countries, and despite dimensions of [[political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|political abuse of psychiatry]] which were unprecedented in history and were being persistently denied for two decades from 1968 to 1988.<ref name="15-летие">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last=Савенко|first=Юрий|title=15-летие Закона о психиатрической помощи|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2007|issue=№ 3|pages=9–10|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2007/3/law.htm|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> When Soviet rule was coming to an end, the decision to develop the Mental Health Law was taken from above and under the threat of economic sanctions from the [[United States]].<ref name="15-летие"/> At a meeting held by the Health Committee of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in the autumn of 1991, the Law was approved, particularly in the speeches by the four members of the commission of the [[World Psychiatric Association]], but this event was followed by the dissolution of the Soviet Union.<ref name="15-летие"/> In 1992, a new commission was created under the [[Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation]] and used a new concept of developing the Law; a quarter of the commission members were the representatives of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] (IPA).<ref name="15-летие"/> The Law has been in force since 1 January 1993.<ref name="15-летие"/> Adoption of the Law ''On Psychiatric Care and Guarantees of Citizens’ Rights during Its Provision'' is regarded as an epoch-making event in the history of domestic psychiatry, as establishing the legal basis for psychiatric care, and, first of all, mediating all involuntary measures through judicial procedure.<ref name="15-летие"/> That is a major post-Soviet achievement of Russian psychiatry and the foundation for a basically new attitude to the mentally ill as persons reserving all their civil and political rights and freedoms.<ref name="15-летие"/> In 1993, when the IPA printed the Law in 50 thousand copies for the general reader, quite a number of heads of the Moscow psychoneurologic dispensaries refused to circulate the Law.<ref name="15-летие"/> Over time, these difficulties were overcome.<ref name="15-летие"/> It became obligatory to know the Law to pass the certification exam.<ref name="15-летие"/>

However, article 38, which was once included in the Law as a guarantee of keeping the whole Law for patients of psychiatric hospitals, is still not working, and, as a result, the service independent of health authorities to defend rights of patients in psychiatric hospitals is still not created.<ref name="17 лет">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|title=17 лет неисполнения закона — цена доверия к власти и киргизский опыт|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2009|issue=№ 1|pages=85–86|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2009/1/14-kirg.htm|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref>

== Involuntary mental hospitalization == 
Section 29 of the Law sets out the following three grounds for an involuntary hospitalization in a psychiatric hospital: 
{{quote|A mentally disturbed individual may be hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital against his will or the will of his legal representative and without a court decision having been taken, if the individual’s examination or treatment can only be carried out by in-patient care, and the mental disorder is severe enough to give rise to: 
:a) a direct danger to the person or to others, or 
:b) the individual’s helplessness, i.e. an inability to take care of himself, or 
:c) a significant impairment in health as a result of a deteriorating mental condition, if the affected person were to be left without psychiatric care.<ref name="Закон"/>}}

According to the IPA president [[Yuri Savenko]], loud claims, importunate molestations, shocking texts in a personal computer, participation in protests, hunger strikes, protest reaction against sudden and rude involuntary measures started to be called a direct danger.<ref name="Савенко, Мурсалиева">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last1=Савенко|first1=Юрий|last2=Мурсалиева|first2=Галина|title= Дело Андрея Новикова.

The citizen may voluntarily go to a psychiatrist who will found a severe mental disorder that requires the mandatory admission to a psychiatric inpatient unit. If the patient refuses the hospitalization offered to him, the doctor gets the right to start the procedure of involuntary hospitalization.<ref name="Психиатрия, 2011">{{cite book|title=Психиатрия: Национальное руководство|year=2011|publisher=ГЭОТАР-Медиа|location=Москва|isbn=5970420301|pages=83|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gZI45wX9GCcC&pg=PA83|editor=Дмитриева Т., Краснов В., Незнанов Н., Семке В., Тиганов А.}}</ref> 

According to the statement made by Libovy Vinogradova of the IPA in 2005, a court comes to a hospital where it must make a number of judgments as to whether rightly or wrongly the hospital applies for the involuntary treatment of a person. The court makes its judgments for 20 cases within 20 minutes. In practice it means that the judge automatically signs judgments offered to him ready-made by the staff to allow for the involuntary treatments to continue.<ref name=Горелик>{{cite web|last=Горелик|first=Кристина|title=Возвращение карательной психиатрии?|url=http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/127501.html|publisher=[[Radio Liberty]]|accessdate=16 December 2012|month=12 November|year=2005}}</ref> 

As St. Petersburg lawyer Fanis Khalikov notes, the information about the time and place of the court session may simply be hidden from the hospitalized person and his representative. The hospitalized person may learn that he is in court at the time when the court session is underway or ready to start presently, when nothing can be done to ensure self-defence. It also happens that the person is not given an opportunity to contact his representative (lawyer), who could defend his interests in court, or with relatives (confidential agents, acquaintances, human rights organizations) so that they find and get a defence attorney to court. Or the defence attorney is not given an opportunity to meet with the hospitalized person; all possible obstacles are placed to prevent it.<ref name="Халиков">{{cite news|last=Халиков|first=Фанис|title=Ну сумасшедший, что возьмешь?|url=http://www.gazeta-yurist.ru/article.php?i=1924|accessdate=2 November 2012|newspaper=эж-Юрист|date=19 October 2012}}</ref>

According to a report by the [[European Committee for the Prevention of Torture]], the Law does not reflect a patient's right to obtain a judgment for the involuntary hospitalization.<ref name="Визит">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|title=Визит в Россию европейского комитета против пыток|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2008|issue=№ 4|pages=88–91|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2008/4/20-visit.htm|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> In a hospital courtroom, the judge announces the judgment, but the patient does not obtain any motivated judgment.<ref name="Визит"/> There are sometimes cases where the patient is not informed by the court at all and hears about the judgment from his or her treating doctor or head of the unit.<ref name="Визит"/>

== Law enforcement practice ==
According to Yuri Savenko, law enforcement practice, of course, is very far from the letter of the Law, forensic psychiatric expert examination has deteriorated because of the lack of competition, and courts implicitly fulfill wishes of the hierarchy of executive authority affected by corruption.<ref>{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last=Савенко|first=Юрий|title=Об антипсихиатрических домыслах|journal=Альманах "Неволя"|year=2012|issue=№ 28|url=http://index.org.ru/nevol/2012-28/15-savenko.html|accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref> The Russian legislation did not implement Principle 18 of the [[Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care]], approved by the [[UN General Assembly]] in 1991, with respect to a patient’s right to an independent psychiatric report.<ref name=Аргунова>{{ru icon}} {{cite book|last=Аргунова|first=Юлия|title=Права граждан с психическими расстройствами|year=2007|publisher=ФОЛИУМ|location=Москва|pages=9|url=http://www.npar.ru/pub/argreg/pre.htm}}</ref> 

=== Exception in the Law enforcement practice ===
Section 29 of the Law concerning involuntary hospitalization in a mental hospital shall not apply to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with [[parliamentary immunity|parliamentary]] or [[judicial immunity]].<ref name="Асриянц, Чернова">{{ru icon}} {{cite news|last1=Асриянц|first1=С.|last2=Чернова|first2=Н.|title=Юрий Савенко и Любовь Виноградова (Интервью)|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/online/83.html|accessdate=18 April 2012|newspaper=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|date=17 February 2010}}</ref> A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his or her diploma and sentenced to imprisonment.<ref name="Асриянц, Чернова"/><ref>{{ru icon}} {{cite web|title=Лиц со статусом неприкосновенности не надо лечить без их письменного согласия?|url=http://www.npar.ru/news/25.htm|publisher=The [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]]|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref> Passport data of persons vested with parliamentary or judicial immunity shall be included in the computer database, which is available to every psychiatric institution and shall be used by every psychiatrist before addressing the issue of involuntary hospitalization of a person in a psychiatric hospital.<ref name="Асриянц, Чернова"/>

== Attempts to amend and repeal the Law ==
Over five years, from 1998 to 2003, the [[Serbsky Center]] made three attempts to submit for the [[Duma]] readings of amendments and additions to the Law, but the IPA and general public managed to successfully challenge these amendments, and they were finally tabled.<ref name="Дело Арап">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last=Савенко|first=Юрий|title=Дело Ларисы Арап или как можно поместить любого в психиатрическую лечебницу|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2007|issue=№ 3|pages=75–77|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2007/3/arap.htm|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref> According to the IPA, these amendments to the Law, if adopted, would have impaired patients’ rights.<ref name="Неволя">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|last1=Виноградова|first1=Любовь|last2=Савенко|first2=Юрий|title=Попытка выхолостить очередной демократический закон|journal=Альманах «Неволя»|year=2006|issue=№ 6|url=http://index.org.ru/nevol/2006-6/vins_n6.htm|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref> In 2004, for instance, proponents of mental health reform could hardly prevent the effort by the doctors of the Serbsky Center to roll back some reforms in the Law.<ref name="Murphy">{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Kim|title=Speak Out?

In 2012, Mikhail Vinogradov, an expert of the Serbsky Center, said: “We must restore a law that was in the Soviet Union”. He noted that the request by a large group of Petersburg and Moscow psychiatrists to restore the old mental health law was submitted to the State Duma.<ref>{{cite news|title=Психиатры пытаются вернуть закон о психиатрической помощи, который был при Советском Союзе|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/news/2012/11/12/22291819/|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=Накануне.RU|date=12 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=Goble>{{cite journal|last=Goble|first=Paul|title=Russia Considering Restoring Soviet-Era Law on Psychiatry, Opening Door to Political Abuse|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=40100|journal=[[Eurasia Daily Monitor]]|year=2012|month=13 November|volume=9|issue=208}} На русском языке: {{cite web|last=Гобл|first=Пол|title=Россия может восстановить советский закон о психиатрии, удобный для политических преследований|url=http://www.inosmi.ru/russia/20121115/202163032.html|publisher=[[Inosmi]]|accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref>

== Estimations of the Law ==
According to the analysis by psychotherapist [[Elena Romek]], provisions of the Law are in conflict with civil rights guaranteed by the [[Constitution of the Russian Federation]], universally recognized norms of [[international law]], professional and ethical norms of medicine, and [[presumption of innocence]].<ref name=Ромек>{{ru icon}} {{cite book|last=Ромек|first=Елена|title=Психотерапия: теоретическое основание и социальное становление|year=2002|publisher=Издательство РГУ|location=Ростов-на-Дону|pages=108–131|url=http://elena.romek.ru/romek_8.htm|chapter=Психиатрия и права человека}}</ref> According to representatives of the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] (MHG), the Law does not comply with the European practice of mental health care. The case of Rakevich v. Russia considered in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] gave grounds for the following assertion by the head of MHG legal programs Natalia Kravchuk:
{{quote|… Russian legislation in this area is featureless and vague. It is for this reason  that it is so hard for people to assert their rights, and they have to reach the European Court of Human Rights.<ref name=Афанасьев>{{ru icon}} {{cite web|last1=Афанасьев|first1=Иван|last2=Ваганов|first2=Арсений|title=Европа повязала российских санитаров|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/2003/10/29/rakevi4vyigr.shtml|publisher=[[Gazeta.ru]]|accessdate=19 April 2012|month=30 October|year=2003}}</ref>}} 

St. Petersburg lawyer Fanis Khalikov believes that the mental health legislation is subject to fundamental and in-depth reforming, because it is the current editions of the Law No. 3185-1 and other regulations (for example, Chapter 35 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation) that do not hold water.<ref name="Халиков"/>
