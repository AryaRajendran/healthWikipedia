The '''tongue''' is a [[muscular hydrostat]] on the floors of the [[mouth]]s of most [[vertebrate]]s which manipulates [[food]] for [[mastication]]. It is the primary [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] of [[taste]] (gustation), as much of the upper surface of the tongue is covered in [[taste buds|papillae and taste buds]]. It is sensitive and kept moist by [[saliva]], and is richly supplied with [[nerve]]s and [[blood vessel]]s. In [[human]]s a secondary function of the tongue is [[Articulatory phonetics|phonetic articulation]]. The tongue also serves as a natural means of [[oral hygiene|cleaning]] one's [[teeth]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maton |first1=Anthea |last2=Hopkins |first2=Jean |last3=McLaughlin |first3=Charles William |last4=Johnson |first4=Susan |last5=Warner |first5=Maryanna Quon |last6=LaHart |first6=David |last7=Wright |first7=Jill D. |title=Human Biology and Health |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1993 |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, USA |isbn=0-13-981176-1}}</ref> The ability to perceive different tastes is not localised in different parts of the tongue, as is widely believed.<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-taste-map-all-wrong The Taste Map: All Wrong] ''[[Scientific American]], 2001-03-18.</ref> This error arose because of misinterpretation of some 19th-century research (see [[tongue map]]).

==Etymology==
The word '''tongue''' derives from the [[Old English]] ''tunge'', which comes from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''tungōn''.<ref name="OED">[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tongue Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref> It has [[cognates]] in other [[Germanic languages]] — for example ''tonge'' in [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], ''tong'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]/[[Afrikaans]], ''tunge'' in [[Danish language|Danish]]/[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and ''tunga'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]/[[Faroese language|Faroese]]/[[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The ''ue'' ending of the word seems to be a fourteenth-century attempt to show "proper pronunciation", but it is "neither etymological nor phonetic".<ref name="OED"/> Some used the spelling ''tunge'' and ''tonge'' as late as the sixteenth century.

It can be used as a [[metonymy|metonym]] for ''language'', as in the phrase ''[[mother tongue]]''. Many languages<ref>[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] ''tong''; [[Danish language|Danish]] ''tunge''; [[Albanian language|Albanian]] ''gjuha''; [[Armenian language|Armenian]] ''lezu'' (լեզու); [[Greek language|Greek]] ''glóssa'' (γλώσσα); [[Irish language|Irish]] ''teanga''; [[Manx language|Manx]] ''çhengey''; [[Latin]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''lingua''; [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''llengua''; [[French language|French]] ''langue''; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''língua''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''lengua''; [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''limba''; [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''ezik'' (език); [[Polish language|Polish]] ''język''; [[Russian language|Russian]] ''yazyk'' (язык); [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''jazyk''; [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''jezik''; [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] ''ziman'' (زمان); [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] ''zabān'' (زبان); [[Arabic]] ''lisān'' (لسان); [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''liššānā'' (ܠܫܢܐ/לשנא); [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''lāšon'' (לָשׁוֹן); [[Maltese language|Maltese]] ''ilsien''; [[Estonian language|Estonian]] ''keel''; [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''kieli''; [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''nyelv''; [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''dil''; [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Khakas language|Khakas]] ''til'' (тіл)</ref> have the same word for "tongue" and "[[language]]".

===Figures of speech===
A common temporary failure in word [[Recollection|retrieval]] from [[memory]] is referred to as the ''[[Tip of the tongue|tip-of-the-tongue]]'' [[phenomenon]]. The expression ''[[Tongue-in-cheek|tongue in cheek]]'' refers to a statement that is not to be taken entirely seriously– something said or done with subtle ironic or sarcastic humour. A ''[[tongue twister]]'' is a phrase made specifically to be very difficult to pronounce. Aside from being a [[Ankyloglossia|medical condition]], "tongue-tied" means being unable to say what you want to due to confusion or restriction. The phrase "cat got your tongue" refers to when a person is speechless. To "bite one's tongue" is a phrase which describes holding back an opinion to avoid causing offence. A "slip of the tongue" refers to an unintentional utterance, such as a [[Freudian slip]]. [[Speaking in tongues]] is a common phrase used to describe ''glossolalia'', which is to make smooth, language-resembling sounds that is no true spoken language itself. A deceptive person is said to have a [[forked tongue]], and a smooth-talking person said to have a [[silver tongue (disambiguation)|silver tongue]].

==Description==
[[File:Lgive lashon.JPG|right|thumb|175px|The human tongue]]
[[File:Facies inferior linguae.JPG|right|thumb|175px|The underside of a human tongue]]

===Musculature===
{{main|Muscles of tongue}}
The eight [[muscles]] of the human tongue are classified as either ''intrinsic'' or ''extrinsic''. The four intrinsic muscles act to change the shape of the tongue, and are not attached to any bone. The four extrinsic muscles act to change the position of the tongue, and are anchored to bone.

====Extrinsic muscles====
# [[Genioglossus]]
# [[Hyoglossus]]
# [[Styloglossus]]
# [[Palatoglossus]]
The extrinsic muscles originate from bone and extend to the tongue. Their main functions are altering the tongue's position allowing for protrusion, retraction, and side-to-side movement.

====Intrinsic muscles====
# [[Superior longitudinal muscle of tongue|Superior longitudinal]]
# [[Inferior longitudinal muscle of tongue|Inferior longitudinal]]
# [[Verticalis muscle|Verticalis]]
# [[Transversus muscle|Transversus]]
The main function of the intrinsic muscles is to provide shape. They are not involved with changing the position of the tongue and are not attached to bone.

===Vasculature===
The tongue receives its blood supply primarily from the [[lingual artery]], a branch of the [[external carotid artery]] and lingual veins which drain into internal jugular vein. The [[floor of mouth|floor of the mouth]] also receives its blood supply from the lingual artery. The triangle formed by the intermediate tendon of the [[digastric muscle]], the posterior border of the [[mylohyoid muscle]], and the [[hypoglossal]] nerve is sometimes called [[Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov|Pirogov]]'s, Pirogoff's, or Pirogov-[[Belclard]]'s triangle.<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/3186.html Pirogov's triangle]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Topographic anatomy of lingual arterial anastomoses; Pirogov-Belclard's triangle |last1=Jamrozik |first1=T. |last2=Wender |first2=W. |journal=Folia Morphologica |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=51–62 |year=1952 |month=January |PMID=13010300|pmid=13010300}}</ref>  The lingual artery is a good place to stop severe [[hemorrage]] from the tongue.

There is also secondary blood supply to the tongue from the [[tonsillar branch of the facial artery|tonsillar branch]] of the [[facial artery]] and the [[ascending pharyngeal artery]].

===Innervation===
Anterior 2/3rds of tongue
* [[General somatic afferent]]:  [[lingual nerve]] branch of V3 of the [[trigeminal nerve]] [[CN V]]
* [[Taste]]: [[chorda tympani]] branch of [[facial nerve]] [[CN VII]] (carried to the tongue by the [[lingual nerve]]).

Posterior 1/3rd of tongue
* [[General somatic afferent]] and [[taste]]: [[Glossopharyngeal nerve]] [[CN IX]]

Motor
* All intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue are supplied by the [[hypoglossal nerve]] ([[CN XII]]), except for one of the extrinsic muscles, [[palatoglossus]], which is innervated by the Vagus nerve [[CN X]] of the pharyngeal plexus.

==Length==
The average length of the human tongue from the [[oropharynx]] to the tip is 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in).<ref>{{cite book |year=1997 |last=Kerrod |first=Robin |title=MacMillan's Encyclopedia of Science |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company, Inc. |volume=6 |isbn=0-02-864558-8}}</ref>

==Physiology==
Chemicals that stimulate [[taste receptor]] cells are known as tastants. Once a tastant is dissolved in [[saliva]], it can make contact with the [[plasma membrane]] of the gustatory hairs, which are the sites of taste [[transduction (physiology)|transduction]].<ref>Tortora. ''Principles of Anatomy and Physiology'' 12th edition, chapter 17, p.602.</ref>

The tongue is equipped with many [[taste buds]] on its [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]] surface, and each taste bud is equipped with taste receptor cells that can sense particular classes of tastes. There are taste cells for: sweet, bitter, salty or sour, and [[umami]].<ref>Silverhorn. ''Human Physiology: An integrated approach'' 5th edition, chapter 10, p.352.</ref> Umami receptor cells are the least understood but research into the key features is making progress.<ref>Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel Todd. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. "Sensation and Perception." Psychology. 2nd ed. New York: Worth, 2009. 166. Print.</ref>

==Pathology==
{{Main|Tongue disease}}

After the [[Gingiva|gum]]s, the tongue is the second most common [[soft tissue]] site for various [[pathology|pathologies]] in the [[oral cavity]]. Pathological conditions of the tongue include [[geographic tongue]],<ref name="MS">{{cite journal |last1=Zadik |first1=Y. |last2=Drucker |first2=S. |last3=Pallmon |first3=S. |title=Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=459–60 |year=2011 |month=Aug |pmid=21763590 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962210004883}}</ref> [[burning mouth syndrome]], tongue [[necrosis]],<ref name="pmid21176820">{{cite journal |last1=Zadik |first1=Yehuda |last2=Findler |first2=Mordechai |last3=Maly |first3=Alexander |last4=Rushinek |first4=Heli |last5=Czerninski |first5=Rakefet |title=A 78-year-old woman with bilateral tongue necrosis |journal=Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=15–9 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21176820 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WP1-51RVMB0-F&_user=10&_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2011&_rdoc=15&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236977%232011%23998889998%232814774%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=6977&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=111&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9a2b15759358123bfbffedf7a8652add&searchtype=a |doi=10.1016/j.tripleo.2010.09.001}}</ref> [[oral hairy leukoplakia]], [[granular cell tumor]] and [[squamous cell carcinoma]].<ref name="SCC">{{cite journal |last1=Lam |first1=L. |last2=Logan |first2=R.

Owing to optimal conditions of humidity, temperature and hiding niche between the tongue papillae and inside the [[tongue piercing|pierced tongue]], the tongue is a preferred site for colonization of [[Candida albicans]].<ref name="Candida">{{cite journal |last1=Zadik |first1=Yehuda |last2=Burnstein |first2=Saar |last3=Derazne |first3=Estella |last4=Sandler |first4=Vadim |last5=Ianculovici |first5=Clariel |last6=Halperin |first6=Tamar |title=Colonization of Candida: prevalence among tongue-pierced and non-pierced immunocompetent adults |journal=Oral Dis |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=172–5 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=19732353 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-0825.2009.01618.x}}</ref>  

Many infections are often found on or under the tongue. One rare but very possible infection is gonorrhea, characterized by small white bumps located underneath the tongue.

==Sublingual medication==
The [[sublingual]] region underneath the front of the tongue is a location where the [[oral mucosa]] is very thin, and underlain by a plexus of veins. This is an ideal location for introducing certain medications to the body. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly [[Blood vessel|vascular]] quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. This is the only convenient and efficacious route of administration (apart from [[Intravenous therapy|I.V.]] administration) of [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerin]] to a patient suffering chest pain from [[angina pectoris]].

==Non-human tongues==
[[File:Okapitongue.jpg|thumb|right|An [[okapi]] cleaning its [[snout|muzzle]] with its tongue]]
Most [[vertebrate]] animals have tongues. In mammals such as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s, the tongue is often used to clean the fur and body. The tongues of these species have a very rough texture which allows them to remove oils and parasites. A dog's tongue also acts as a heat regulator. As a dog increases its exercise the tongue will increase in size due to greater blood flow. The tongue hangs out of the dog's mouth and the moisture on the tongue will work to cool the bloodflow.<ref>[http://www.doctordog.com/drdognewsletter/tongue.html A dog's tongue]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n3u34u4220384846/ |title=Lingual blood flow and its hypothalamic control in the dog during panting |journal=[[Pflügers Archiv European Journal of Physiology]] |month=January |year=1976 |issn=0031-6768 |doi=10.1007/BF00583652 |pages=25–31 |volume=367 |issue=1 |last1=Krönert |first1=H. |last2=Pleschka |first2=K. |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref>

Some animals have tongues that are specially adapted for catching prey. For example, [[chameleon]]s, [[frog]]s, and [[anteater]]s have [[prehensility|prehensile]] tongues.

Many species of fish have small folds at the base of their mouths that might informally be called tongues, but they lack a muscular structure like the true tongues found in most [[tetrapod]]s.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |last1=Romer |first1=Alfred Sherwood |last2=Parsons |first2=Thomas S. |year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA |pages=298–299 |isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kingsley |first=John Sterling |year=1912 |title=Comparative anatomy of vertebrates |publisher=P.

Other animals may have organs that are [[analogy (biology)|analogous]] to tongues, such as a [[butterfly]]'s [[proboscis]] or a [[radula]] on a [[mollusca|mollusc]], but these are not [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with the tongues found in vertebrates, and often have little resemblance in function, for example, butterflies do not lick with their proboscides; they suck thorough them, and the proboscis is not a single organ, but two jaws held together to form a tube.<ref name= "isbn0-412-61390-5">{{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=O.

===As food===
{{See also|Beef tongue}}

The tongues of some animals are consumed and sometimes considered delicacies. Hot tongue sandwiches are frequently found on menus in [[Kosher]] [[delicatessen]]s in America. [[Taco|Taco de lengua]] (''lengua'' being Spanish for tongue) is a taco filled with [[beef tongue]], and is especially popular in Mexican cuisine. As part of Colombian gastronomy, Tongue in Sauce (Lengua en Salsa), is a dish prepared by frying the tongue, adding tomato sauce, onions and salt.  Tongue can also be prepared as [[birria]]. Pig and beef tongue are consumed in Chinese cuisine. [[Duck]] tongues are sometimes employed in [[Szechuan cuisine|Szechuan]] dishes, while [[Lamb (food)|lamb]]'s tongue is occasionally employed in Continental and contemporary American cooking. Fried [[cod]] "tongue" is a relatively common part of fish meals in [[Norway]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] cow tongue is cooked and served in vinegar (''lengua a la vinagreta'').  In the Czech Republic and Poland, a pork tongue is considered a delicacy,and there are many ways of preparing it. In Eastern Slavic countries, pork and beef tongues are commonly consumed, boiled and garnished with horseradish or jelled; beef tongues fetch a significantly higher price and are considered more of a delicacy.  In Alaska, cow tongues are among the more common.

Tongues of seals and whales have been eaten, sometimes in large quantities, by sealers and whalers, and in various times and places have been sold for food on shore.<ref>CHARLES BOARDMAN HAWES. Whaling. Doubleday, 1924</ref>

==Cultural aspects==
Sticking one's tongue out at someone is considered a childish gesture of rudeness and/or defiance in many countries; the act may also have  sexual connotations, depending on the way in which it is done. However, in [[Tibet]] it is considered a greeting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tibetwrites.org/?Tibetan-Culture-in-the-21st |title=Tibetan culture in the 21st century |author=Bhuchung K Tsering |date=27 December 2007 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref> In 2009, a farmer from [[Fabriano]], Italy was convicted and fined by [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|the country's highest court]] for sticking his tongue out at a neighbor with whom he had been arguing. Proof of the affront had been captured with a cell phone camera.<ref name="UPI">[http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2009/12/19/Sticking-out-your-tongue-ruled-illegal/UPI-71761261272837/ Sticking out your tongue ruled illegal]</ref>
[[Blowing a raspberry]] can also be meant as a gesture of derision.

;'''Body art'''
Being a cultural custom for long time, [[tongue piercing]] and [[tongue splitting|splitting]] has become quite common in western countries in recent decades, with up to one-fifth of young adults having at least one piece of body art in the tongue.<ref name="DTLEVIN">{{cite journal |last1=Liran |first1=Levin |last2=Yehuda |first2=Zadik |last3=Tal |first3=Becker |title=Oral and dental complications of intra-oral piercing |journal=Dent Traumatol |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=341–3 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16262620 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2005.00395.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118672805/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>
