The '''rectus abdominis muscle,''' also known as the "'''abs'''," is a paired [[muscle]] running vertically on each side of the anterior wall of the human abdomen, as well as that of some other mammals. There are two parallel muscles, separated by a midline band of [[connective tissue]] called the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]] ("white line"). It extends from the [[pubic symphysis]], [[pubic crest]] and [[pubic tubercle]] inferiorly, to the [[xiphoid process]] and [[costal cartilages]] of ribs V to VII superiorly.<ref>Gray's Anatomy for students, 2nd edition, Page:176</ref>

It is contained in the [[rectus sheath]], which consists of the [[aponeurosis|aponeuroses]] of the lateral abdominal muscles. 

Three, and sometimes four, bands of connective tissue called the [[tendinous intersections]] traverse the rectus abdominus, which separate it into six or eight distinct muscle bellies, respectively. The appearance of these segments has led to the rectus abdominus also being called the "'''six-pack'''."

==Function==
The rectus abdominis is an important [[human position|postural]] muscle. It is responsible for flexing the [[lumbar spine]], as when doing a "[[crunch (exercise)|crunch]]". The rib cage is brought up to where the [[pelvis]] is when the pelvis is fixed, or the pelvis can be brought towards the rib cage (posterior pelvic tilt) when the rib cage is fixed, such as in a leg-hip raise. The two can also be brought together simultaneously when neither is fixed in space.

The rectus abdominis assists with breathing and plays an important role in [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] when forcefully exhaling, as seen after exercise as well as in conditions where exhalation is difficult such as emphysema. It also helps in keeping the internal organs intact and in creating intra-abdominal pressure, such as when exercising or lifting heavy weights, during forceful defecation or parturition (childbirth).

==Blood supply==
The rectus abdominis has several sources of arterial blood supply. In reconstructive surgery terms, it is a Mathes and Nahai<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7465666 |year=1981 |last1=Mathes |first1=SJ |last2=Nahai |first2=F |title=Classification of the vascular anatomy of muscles: Experimental and clinical correlation |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=177–87 |journal=Plastic and reconstructive surgery}}</ref> Type III muscle with two dominant pedicles. First, the [[inferior epigastric artery]] and vein (or veins) run superiorly on the posterior surface of the rectus abdominis, enter the rectus fascia at the [[Arcuate line (anterior abdominal wall)|arcuate line]], and serve the lower part of the muscle. Second, the [[superior epigastric artery]], a terminal branch of the [[internal thoracic artery]], supplies blood to the upper portion. Finally, numerous small segmental contributions come from the lower six [[intercostal artery|intercostal arteries]] as well.

==Innervation==
The muscles are innervated by [[thoracoabdominal nerve]]s, which pierce the anterior layer of the [[rectus sheath]].

==Location==
The rectus abdominis is a long flat muscle, which extends along the whole length of the front of the abdomen, and is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the [[linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]].

The muscle is inserted by three portions of unequal size into the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh [[ribs]].                 

The upper portion, attached principally to the cartilage of the fifth rib, usually has some fibers of insertion into the anterior extremity of the rib itself.

Some fibers are occasionally connected with the [[costoxiphoid ligaments]], and the side of the [[xiphoid process]].

==Damage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
An abdominal muscle strain, also called a pulled abdominal muscle, is an injury to one of the muscles of the abdominal wall. A muscle strain occurs when the muscle is stretched too far. When this occurs the muscle fibers are torn. Most commonly, a strain causes microscopic tears within the muscle, but occasionally, in severe injuries, the muscle can rupture from its attachment.

The rectus abdominis is similar in most vertebrates. The most obvious difference between animal and human abdominal musculature is that in animals, there are a different number of tendinous intersections.
