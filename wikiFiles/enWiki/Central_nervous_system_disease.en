A '''central nervous system disease''' can affect either the [[spinal cord]] ([[myelopathy]]) or [[brain]] ([[encephalopathy]]), both of which are part of the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="urlNervous System Diseases">{{cite web |url=http://www.healthinsite.gov.au/topics/Nervous_System_Diseases |title=Nervous System Diseases |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>   

==Functions==
===Spinal Cord===
{{Main|Spinal cord}}
The spinal cord transmits sensory reception from the [[peripheral nervous system]].<ref name="urlPeripheral Nervous System">{{cite web |url=http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/P/PNS.html |title=Organization of the Nervous System |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> It also conducts motor information to the body's [[skeletal muscles]], [[cardiac muscles]], [[smooth muscles]], and [[glands]]. There are 31 pairs of [[spinal nerves]] along the spinal cord. These nerves each contain both sensory and motor [[axon]]s. The spinal cord is protected by [[vertebra]]e, and connects the peripheral nervous system to the brain, and it acts as a "minor" coordinating center.

===Brain===
{{Main|Human brain}}It allows the body to function. The brain is protected by the skull; however, if the brain is damaged, the results to the human body can be very consequential.

==Types of disease==
===Encephalitis===
{{Main|Encephalitis}}
Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. It is usually caused by a foreign substance or a [[viral infection]]. Symptoms of this disease include: headache, neck pain, drowsiness, nausea, and fever. If caused by the [[West Nile virus]],<ref name="urlWest Nile Virus">{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/west_nile_encephalitis/article.htm |title=West Nile Virus |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> it may be lethal to humans, as well as birds and horses.

===Meningitis===
{{Main|Meningitis}}
Meningitis is an inflammation of the [[meninges]] (membranes) of the brain and spinal cord. It is most often caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Fever, vomiting, and a stiff neck are all symptoms of meningitis.

===Tropical spastic paraparesis===
{{Main|Tropical spastic paraparesis}}
Troby a virus that can also cause [[leukemia]], a disease of the [[bone marrow]].

===Arachnoid cysts===
{{Main|Arachnoid cysts}}
Arachnoid cysts are [[cerebrospinal fluid]] covered by arachnoidal cells that may develop on the brain or spinal cord.<ref name="urlArachnoid Cysts">{{cite web |url=http://arachnoidcyst.org/functions.php |title=How the Brain Works |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> They are a [[congenital disorder]] and in some cases may not show symptoms. However, if there is a large cyst, symptoms may include headache, seizures, [[ataxia]] (lack of muscle control), [[hemiparesis]], and several others. [[Macrocephaly]] and [[ADHD]] are common among children, while pre-senile dementia, [[hydrocephalus]] (an abnormality of the dynamics of the cerebrospinal fluid), and [[urinary incontinence]] are symptoms for elderly patients (65 and older).
===Huntington's===
{{Main|Huntington's disease}}
Huntington's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that is inherited. Degeneration of neuronal cells occurs throughout the brain, especially in the [[striatum]]. There is a progressive decline which results in abnormal movements.<ref name="urlHuntington's Disease">{{cite web |url=http://www.hdsa.org/living-with-huntingtons/family-care/stages-of-hd.html |title=Huntington's Disease |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Statistics show that Huntington’s disease may affect 10 per 100,000 people of Western European descent.

===Alzheimer’s===
{{Main|Alzheimer's disease}}
Alzheimer’s is a [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease typically found in people over the age of 65 years. Worldwide, approximately 24 million people have [[dementia]]; 60% of these cases are due to Alzheimer’s. The ultimate cause is unknown. The clinical sign of Alzheimer’s is progressive cognition deterioration.

=== Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD)=== 

Main article: [[Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) 

ADHD(often highly debated & controversial.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_controversies</ref>)is now largely considered to be a genuine<ref>http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Healthday/brain-studies-show-adhd-real-disease/story?id=4508193#.UYB2rKLvu_o</ref>,organic disorder of the nervous system according to the United States government .<ref>http://www.genome.gov/10004300#al-1</ref><ref>http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/202997.php</ref> <ref>http://www.ssdrc.com/attention-deficit.html</ref>ADHD which in severe cases can be debilitating.<ref>http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/112.00-MentalDisorders-Childhood.htm</ref>Has symptoms thought to be caused by structural as well as biochemical  imbalances in the brain.<ref>http://health.howstuffworks.com/mental-health/adhd/adhd1.htm</ref>In Particular low levels of the neurotransmitters [[dopamine]] & norephinprine,<ref>http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/guide/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd</ref> which are responsible for controlling & maintaining  attention & movement.Many people with ADHD continue to have symptoms well into adulthood.<ref>http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/adult-adhd/DS01161</ref>In addition, Adult ADHD has(recently,as of 2011.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20491888</ref><ref>http://news.health.com/2011/01/19/adult-adhd-often-precedes-certain-type-of-dementia-study/</ref>) been associated with an increased risk of the development of [[Dementia with Lewy bodies]],or(DLB)<ref>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110118092132.htm</ref> a progressive,& often fatal neurological disease with symptoms similar to both Alzheimer's disease & Parkinson's disease which often occurs in people over age 65. <ref>http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/adult-adhd/DS01161</ref><ref>http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dementiawithlewybodies/dementiawithlewybodies.htm</ref>

===Locked-in syndrome===
{{Main|Locked-in syndrome}}
Locked-in syndrome is due to a lesion on the brain stem, damaging the [[pons]]. It is a condition where the patient is awake, but suffers from paralysis<ref name="urlLocked-in syndrome">{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/lockedinsyndrome/lockedinsyndrome.htm |title=Locked-In Syndrome |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> of all or nearly all voluntary muscles of the body and cannot communicate or move. Causes of locked-in syndrome may be: traumatic brain injury, [[circulatory system disease]], nerve cell damage, and [[overdose]] of medication.

===Parkinson's===
{{Main|Parkinson's disease}}
Parkinson’s affects the motor skills and speech.  Symptoms may include [[bradykinesia]] (slow physical movement), muscle rigidity, and tremors. Behavior, thinking, and sensation disorders are non-motor symptoms.
===Tourette's===
{{Main|Tourette syndrome}}
Tourette's syndrome is an inherited neurological disorder. Early onset may be during childhood, and is characterized by physical [[tics]] and verbal tics. The exact cause of Tourette's, other than genetic factors, is unknown.

===Multiple sclerosis===
{{Main|Multiple sclerosis}}
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory [[demyelinating disease]], meaning that the [[myelin sheath]] of [[neuron]]s is damaged. Symptoms of MS include: visual and sensation problems, muscle weakness, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].

==Causes==
===Trauma===
{{Main|Traumatic brain injury}}
Any type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) or injury done to the spinal cord can result in a wide spectrum of disabilities in a person. Depending on the section of the brain or spinal cord that suffers the trauma the outcome may be anticipated.

===Infections===
{{Main|List of central nervous system infections}}
Infectious diseases are transmitted in several ways. Some of these infections may affect the brain or spinal cord directly. Generally, an [[infection]] is a disease that is caused by the invasion of a micro-organism or virus.

===Degeneration===
Degenerative spinal disorders involve a loss of function in the spine. Pressure on the spinal cord and nerves may be associated with [[herniation]] or disc displacement. Brain degeneration also causes central nervous system diseases. Studies have shown that [[obese]] people may have severe degeneration in the brain due to loss of tissue affecting [[cognition]].

===Structural defects===
Common structural defects include: birth defects,<ref name="urlBirth Defects">{{cite web |url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/system/ill/birth_defects.html |title=Birth Defects |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> [[anencephaly]], [[hypospadias]], and [[spina bifida]]. Children born with structural defects may have malformed limbs, heart problems, and facial abnormalities.
===Tumors===
A [[tumor]] is an abnormal growth of body tissue. In beginning, tumors can be non-cancerous, but if they are malignant, they are cancerous. In general, they appear when there is a problem with [[cellular division]]. Problems with the body’s [[immune system]] can lead to tumors.

===Autoimmune Disorders===
An [[autoimmune disorder]] is a condition where the immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. This is caused by harmful substances, called [[antigens]].
===Stroke===
{{Main|Stroke}}
A stroke is an interruption of the blood supply to the brain. Approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the US has a stroke.<ref name="urlStroke">{{cite web |url=http://www.hearthealthywomen.org/index.php?view=article&id=581 |title=Stroke |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> This can happen when a [[blood vessel]] is blocked by a [[blood clot]] or when a blood vessel ruptures, causing blood to leak to the brain. If the brain cannot get enough oxygen and blood, brain cells can die, leading to permanent damage.

==Signs and Symptoms==
Every disease has different [[Medical sign|signs]] and [[symptoms]]. Some include: persistent headache,pain in the(face, back, arms, or legs.)Inability to concentrate, loss of feeling,memory loss,loss of muscle strength, [[tremors]], seizures, muscle [[fasciculations]] also known as(twitching), ,tics, paralysis, and [[slurred speech]]. One should seek medical attention if affected by these.

==Treatments==
There is a wide range of treatments for central nervous system diseases. These can range from surgery to [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] or prescribed medications.
