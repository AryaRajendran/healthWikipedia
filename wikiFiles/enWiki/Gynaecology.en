[[Image:Gynaecology-1822.jpg|thumb|The historic taboo associated with the examination of [[Female reproductive system (human)|female genitalia]] has long inhibited the science of gynaecology. This 1822 drawing by Jacques-Pierre Maygnier shows a "compromise" procedure, in which the [[physician]] is kneeling before the woman but cannot see her genitalia. Modern gynaecology has shed these inhibitions.]]

'''Gynaecology''' or '''gynecology'''<ref>See [[American and British English spelling differences]]. ''Gynecology'' is the American spelling, but it is also common in international contexts, e.g. [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] and [http://www.isuog.org International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology].</ref> is the medical practice dealing with the health of the [[female reproductive system]] ([[uterus]], [[vagina]], and [[ovaries]]). Literally, outside medicine, it means "the science of [[woman|women]]".  Its counterpart is [[andrology]], which deals with medical issues specific to the male reproductive system.

Almost all modern gynaecologists are also [[obstetrics|obstetricians]] (see ''[[obstetrics and gynaecology]]'').  In many areas, the specialties of gynaecology and obstetrics overlap. 

==Etymology==
The word "gynaecology" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ancient Greek gyne, γυνή, modern Greek gynaika, γυναίκα, meaning woman and logia, meaning study, so gynaecology literally is the study of women.

==History==
The [[Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus]] is the oldest known  medical text of any kind.  Dated to about 1800 B.C., it deals with women's complaints—gynaecological diseases, fertility, pregnancy, contraception, etc. The text is divided into thirty-four sections, each section dealing with a specific problem and containing  diagnosis and treatment, no [[prognosis]] is suggested. Treatments are non surgical, comprising applying medicines to the affected body part or swallowing them. The womb is at times seen as the source of complaints manifesting themselves in other body parts.<ref>Laurinda S. Dixon. ''Perilous Chastity: Women and Illness in Pre-Enlightenment Art and Medicine'', Cornell University Press 1995, pp.15f.</ref>

The [[Hippocratic Corpus]] contains several gynaecological treatises dating to the 5th/4th centuries BC. The gynaecological treatise ''Gynaikeia'' by [[Soranus of Ephesus]] (1st/2nd century AD) is extant (together with a 6th-century [[Latin]] paraphrase by [[Muscio]], a physician of the same school). He was the chief representative of the school of physicians known as the "[[Methodic school|Methodists]]".

[[J. Marion Sims]] is considered the father of American gynaecology. He developed many of his techniques by operating on slaves, many of whom were not given anesthesia.

==Examination==
Gynaecology is typically considered a consultant specialty. In some countries, women must first see a [[general practitioner]] (GP; also known as a family practitioner (FP)) prior to seeing a gynaecologist. If their condition requires training, knowledge, surgical procedure, or equipment unavailable to the GP, the patient is then referred to a gynaecologist. In the [[United States]], however, law and many [[health insurance]] plans allow gynaecologists to provide [[primary care]] in addition to aspects of their own specialty. With this option available, some women opt to see a gynaecological surgeon for non-gynaecological problems without another physician's referral.

As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is quite intimate, more so than a routine physical exam. It also requires unique instrumentation such as the [[speculum (medical)|speculum]]. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of concave metal or plastic which are used to retract the tissues of the vagina and permit examination of the [[cervix]], the lower part of the uterus located within the upper portion of the vagina. Gynaecologists typically do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen and one or two fingers in the vagina) to palpate the cervix, uterus, ovaries and bony [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. It is not uncommon to do a [[rectovaginal examination]] for complete evaluation of the pelvis, particularly if any suspicious masses are appreciated. Male gynaecologists may have a female [[chaperone (clinical)|chaperone]] for their examination. An abdominal and/or vaginal [[obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]] can be used to confirm any abnormalities appreciated with the bimanual examination or when indicated by the patient's history.

==Diseases==
The main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:
# [[Cancer]] and pre-cancerous diseases of the reproductive organs including ovaries, [[fallopian tube]]s, uterus, cervix, vagina, and vulva
# [[Urinary incontinence|Incontinence]] of urine
# [[Amenorrhoea]] (absent [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual periods]])
# [[dysmenorrhea|Dysmenorrhoea]] (painful menstrual periods)
# [[Infertility]]
# [[Menorrhagia]] (heavy menstrual periods); a common indication for [[hysterectomy]]
# [[Prolapse]] of pelvic organs
# [[Infections]] of the vagina ([[vaginitis]]), cervix and uterus (including [[fungus|fungal]], [[bacteria]]l, [[virus|viral]], and [[protozoa]]l)
There is some crossover in these areas. For example, a woman with urinary incontinence may be referred to a [[urology|urologist]].

==Therapies==
As with all surgical specialties, gynaecologists may employ medical or surgical therapies (or many times, both), depending on the exact nature of the problem that they are treating. Pre- and post-operative medical management will often employ many standard drug therapies, such as [[antibiotics]], [[diuretics]], [[antihypertensives]], and [[antiemetics]]. Additionally, gynaecologists make frequent use of specialized [[hormone]]-modulating therapies (such as [[Clomifene]] citrate and [[hormonal contraception]]) to treat disorders of the female genital tract that are responsive to [[pituitary]] and/or [[gonad]]al signals.

Surgery, however, is the mainstay of gynaecological therapy. For historical and political reasons, gynaecologists were previously not considered "surgeons", although this point has always been the source of some controversy. Modern advancements in both general surgery and gynaecology, however, have blurred many of the once rigid lines of distinction. The rise of sub-specialties within gynaecology which are primarily surgical in nature (for example urogynaecology and gynaecological oncology) have strengthened the reputations of gynaecologists as surgical practitioners, and many surgeons and surgical societies have come to view gynaecologists as comrades of sorts. As proof of this changing attitude, gynaecologists are now eligible for fellowship in both the [[American College of Surgeons]] and [[Royal College of Surgeons|Royal Colleges of Surgeons]], and many newer surgical textbooks include chapters on (at least basic) gynaecological surgery.

Some of the more common operations that gynaecologists perform include: 
# [[Dilation and curettage]] (removal of the uterine contents  for various reasons, including completing a partial miscarriage and diagnostic sampling for dysfunctional uterine bleeding refractive to medical therapy)
# [[Hysterectomy]] (removal of the uterus)
# [[Oophorectomy]] (removal of the ovaries)
# [[Tubal ligation]] (a type of permanent sterilization)
# [[Hysteroscopy]] (inspection of the uterus cavity)
# Diagnostic [[laparoscopy]] – used to diagnose and treat sources of pelvic and abdominal pain; perhaps most famously used to provide a definitive diagnosis of [[endometriosis]].
# Exploratory [[laparotomy]] – may be used to investigate the level of progression of benign or malignant disease, or to assess and repair damage to the pelvic organs.
# Various surgical treatments for [[urinary incontinence]], including [[cystoscopy]] and sub-[[urethra]]l slings.
# Surgical treatment of pelvic organ [[prolapse]], including correction of [[cystocele]] and [[rectocele]].
# [[Appendectomy]] – often performed to remove site of painful [[endometriosis]] implantation and/or prophylactically (against future acute [[appendicitis]]) at the time of [[hysterectomy]] or [[Caesarean section]]. May also be performed as part of a [[Cancer staging|staging]] operation for [[ovarian cancer]].
# Cervical Excision Procedures (including cryosurgery) – removal of the surface of the cervix containing pre-cancerous cells which have been previously identified on [[Pap smear]].

==Specialist training==
In the UK the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]], based in London, encourages the study and advancement of both the science and practice of obstetrics and gynaecology. This is done through postgraduate medical education and training development, and the publication of clinical guidelines and reports on aspects of the specialty and service provision. The RCOG International Office works with other international organisations to help lower maternal morbidity and mortality in under-resourced countries.

[[Gynecologic oncology|Gynaecologic oncology]] is a subspecialty of gynaecology, dealing with gynaecology-related [[cancer]].
