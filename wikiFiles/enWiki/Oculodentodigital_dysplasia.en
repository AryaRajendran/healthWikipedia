'''Oculodentodigital syndrome''' (ODD syndrome) is an extremely rare genetic condition that typically results in small eyes, underdeveloped teeth, and syndactyly and malformation of  the fourth and fifth fingers.  It has also been called '''oculo-dento-digital syndrome''', '''oculodentodigital dysplasia''' (ODDD), and '''oculodentoosseous dysplasia''' (ODOD). It is considered a kind of [[ectodermal dysplasia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Signs and symptoms==
People with ODD syndrome often have a characteristic appearance.  Visible features of the condition include:<ref name="pmid16219735">{{cite journal |author=Vasconcellos JP, Melo MB, Schimiti RB, Bressanim NC, Costa FF, Costa VP |title=A novel mutation in the GJA1 gene in a family with oculodentodigital dysplasia |journal=[[Arch.

* [[microdontia|small teeth]] that are prone to [[caries]] because of [[hypoplasia|underdeveloped]] tooth enamel;
* a long, thin nose;
* [[microphthalmos|unusually small]] eyes; and
* type III [[syndactyly]] of the fourth and fifth fingers.

Iris atrophy and [[glaucoma]] are more common than average.<ref name="pmid16219735" /> The size of the eyes often interferes with learning to read; special eyeglasses may be required. Hair may be fine, thin, dry, or fragile; in some families, it is curly.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kelly SC, Ratajczak P, Keller M, Purcell SM, Griffin T, Richard G |title=A novel GJA 1 mutation in oculo-dento-digital dysplasia with curly hair and hyperkeratosis |journal=Eur J Dermatol |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=241–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16709485 |doi=<!--no DOI--> |url=http://www.john-libbey-eurotext.fr/en/revues/medecine/ejd/e-docs/00/04/18/FC/article.phtml}}</ref>

==Genetics==
ODD is commonly an autosomal dominant condition, but can be inherited as a recessive trait.<ref name="pmid16816024">{{cite journal |author=Richardson RJ, Joss S, Tomkin S, Ahmed M, Sheridan E, Dixon MJ |title=A nonsense mutation in the first transmembrane domain of connexin 43 underlies autosomal recessive oculodentodigital syndrome |journal=J.

Most people inherit this condition from one of their parents, but new cases do arise through novel mutations.<ref name="pmid1110452">{{cite journal |author=Jones KL, Smith DW, Harvey MA, Hall BD, Quan L |title=Older paternal age and fresh gene mutation: data on additional disorders |journal=[[J. Pediatr.]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=84–8 |year=1975 |pmid=1110452 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(75)80709-8}}</ref> The mutation has high [[penetrance]] and variable [[expressivity|expression]], which means that nearly all people with the gene show signs of the condition, but these signs can range from very mild to very obvious.<ref name="pmid10331943" />

==Epidemiology==
The actual incidence of this disease is not known, but only 243 cases have been reported in the scientific literature, suggesting an incidence of [[Order of magnitude|on the order of]] one affected person in ten million people.<ref name="pmid12021949"/>
