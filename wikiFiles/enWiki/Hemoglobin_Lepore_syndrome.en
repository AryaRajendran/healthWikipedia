[[File:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|thumb|right|260px|A crossover between the delta and [[beta globin]] [[gene]] [[locus (genetics)|loci]] results in the [[mutation]] which causes the Hb Lepore [[Phenotypic trait|trait]].]]
'''Hemoglobin Lepore syndrome''' or '''Hb Lepore syndrome''' (Hb Lepore) is typically an [[asymptomatic]] [[hemoglobinopathy]], which is caused by an [[autosomal recessive]] [[Mutation|genetic mutation]]. The Hb Lepore variant, consisting of two normal [[alpha globin]] chains (HBA) and two deltabeta globin fusion chains which occurs due to a "crossover" between the [[HBD|delta]] (HBD) and [[beta globin]] (HBB) gene [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] during [[meiosis]]  and was first identified in an Italian family in 1958.<ref>Gerald P.S., Diamond L.K. A new hereditary hemoglobinopathy (the Lepore trait) and its interaction with thalassemia trait. Blood. 1958 Sep;13(9):835-44. PMID 13572441</ref> There are three varieties of Hb Lepore, Washington (Hb Lepore Washington, AKA Hb Lepore Boston or Hb Lepore Washington-Boston), Baltimore (Hb Lepore Baltimore) and [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] (Hb Hollandia). All three varieties show similar [[Electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] and [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] properties and hematological findings bear close resemblance to those of the [[beta-thalassemia]] [[Phenotypic trait|trait]]; a blood disorder that reduces the production of the iron-containing [[protein]] [[hemoglobin]] which carries oxygen to cells and which may cause [[anemia]].

The [[homozygous]] state for Hb Lepore is rare. Patients of [[Balkans|Balkan]] descent tend to have the most severe presentation of symptoms including severe [[anemia]] during the first five years of life. They also presented with significant [[splenomegaly]], [[hepatomegaly]], and skeletal abnormalities identical to those of homozygous [[beta-thalassemia]]. The amount of Hb Lepore in the patients [[blood]] ranged from 8 to 30%, the remainder being [[fetal hemoglobin]] (Hb F) which is present in minute quantities (typically<1 percent) in the [[red blood cells]] of adults. Known as F- cells they are present in a small proportion of overall RBCs.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rochette J, Craig JE, Thein SL |title=Fetal hemoglobin levels in adults |journal=Blood Rev |date=1994 Dec |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=213–24 |pmid=7534152}}</ref>

[[Heterozygous]] Hb Lepore  is similar to beta-thalassemia major, however the clinical course is variable. Patients with this condition  typically present with severe anemia during the first two years of life. The heterozygote form is mildly anemic (Hb 11-13 g/dl) but presents with a significant [[Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration|hypochromia]] (deficiency of hemoglobin in the [[red blood cells]]) and [[microcytosis]].

==Diagnosis==
{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}
The diagnosis of Hb Lepore syndrome may be performed antenatally or postnatally via the use of a variety of tests
*[[Complete blood count]] (CBC)
*Cation Exchange [[High-performance liquid chromatography]] (CE-HPLC): a [[chromatographic]] technique used to separate and quantify various normal and abnormal hemoglobin components in blood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gupta LCPK, Kumar CH, Kumar CCS,

==Sickle cell-Hb Lepore Boston syndrome==
Sickle cell-Hb Lepore Boston syndrome is a type  of sickle cell disease (HbS) that
differs from homozygous sickle cell disease where both parents carry sickle hemoglobin. In this variant one parent has the sickle cell hemoglobin the second parent has Hb Lepore Boston, the only one of the three variants described in association with HbS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stevens MC, Lehmann H, Mason KP |journal=Am J Dis Child |date=1982 Jan |volume=136|issue=1 |pages=19–22 |title=Sickle cell-Hb Lepore Boston syndrome. Uncommon differential diagnosis to homozygous sickle cell disease |pmid=7055103}}</ref>

==Treatment==
{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}

===Homozygous Hb Lepore===
Management includes a regular course of [[blood transfusion]]s.

===Heterozygous Hb Lepore===
Normal growth and development can occur, with frequent transfusions to maintain a [[hemoglobin]] level above 11 [[gram|g]]/[[deciliter|dl]]. [[Chelation therapy]] is often necessary to control the accumlation of [[iron]] from the tranfusions. Levels of Hb Lepore are thus [[Biosynthesis|synthesized]] in a reduced amount with the levels of Hb Lepore in [[heterozygotes]] ranging from 5 to 15%.

==Silent Stroke==
A potential complication that may occur in children that suffer acute anemia with a hemoglobin count below 5.5  g/dl is [[silent stroke]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Acute anemia linked to silent strokes in children American Stroke Association Meeting Report: Abstract 185 |publisher=American Heart Association |date=2011-02-11 |author=Dowling MM, Quinn CT, Plumb P, Rogers ZR, Rollins N, Koral K, Barber R, Buchanan GR |url=http://www.newsroom.heart.org/index.php?s=43&item=1260 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110726144148/http://www.newsroom.heart.org/index.php?s=43&item=1260 |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}{{Unreliable medical source|date=September 2011}}</ref> A silent stroke is a type of [[stroke]] that does not have any outward symptoms ([[asymptomatic]]), and the patient is typically unaware they have suffered a stroke. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms a silent stroke still causes damage to the brain, and places the patient at increased risk for both [[transient ischemic attack]] and major stroke in the future.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miwa K, Rudivić R, Niazi GA, ''et al.'' |title=Silent cerebral infarction is associated with incident stroke and TIA independent of carotid intima-media thickness |journal=Intern Med |year=2010 |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=817–22 |pmid=20453400 |doi=10.2169/internalmedicine.49.3211}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
The Hb Lepore trait has a worldwide distribution and may affect individuals of various ethnicities however the three main varieties which been defined tend to be more prevalent among specific ethnic groups, typically [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] of the Southern regions [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. The three main varieties are named for the geographical areas they were first identified in with various subtypes, the three main varieties are:
* [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] (Hb Lepore Washington, also known as Hb Lepore Boston or Hb Lepore Washington-Boston);  most common in [[Italians]] from [[Southern Italy]]
*[[Baltimore]] (Hb Lepore Baltimore); first described in a family with [[African]] ancestry; most common in people from the [[Balkan countries]], [[Albanians]] [[Croats]], [[Serbs]], [[Slovenes]] and [[Romanians]]. It has also been described in [[Turkish people|Turks]] and in regions of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. A rare case of the Baltimore variety was discovered in an [[African American]] woman in the [[Bronx, New York]] and dubbed Hn Lepore-Bronx<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Ann Hematol |date=2009 Jun |volume=88 |issue=6 |pages=545–8 |title=Rare occurrence of Hb Lepore-Baltimore in African Americans: molecular characteristics and variations of Hb Lepores |author=McKeown SM, Carmichael H, Markowitz RB, Kutlar A, Holley L, Kutlar F |pmid=18989669 |doi=10.1007/s00277-008-0631-4}}</ref> and another variety was discovered in the city of [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada and dubbed Hb E-Lepore Saskatoon<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Hemoglobin |year=2005 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=215–9 |title=The first case of Hb E-Saskatoon associated with Hb Lepore-Baltimore found in Spain |author=Ropero P, Murga MJ, González FA, Polo M, Benavente C, Salvador M, Villegas A |pmid=16114185}}</ref>
*[[Jayapura|Hollandia]] (Hb Lepore Hollandia); identified in [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Bangladesh]].
