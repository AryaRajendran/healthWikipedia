'''Cyclooxygenase''' ('''COX'''), officially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS), is an [[enzyme]] ({{EC_number|1.14.99.1}}) that is responsible for formation of important biological mediators called [[prostanoid]]s, including [[prostaglandin]]s, [[prostacyclin]] and [[thromboxane]]. Pharmacological inhibition of ''COX'' can provide relief from the symptoms of [[inflammation]] and [[pain]]. [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, such as [[aspirin]] and [[ibuprofen]], exert their effects through inhibition of COX. The names "prostaglandin synthase (PHS)" and "prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase (PES)" are still used to refer to COX.

== Function ==
{{See also|Prostaglandin|Eicosanoid}}
''COX'' converts [[arachidonic acid]] (AA, an [[Omega-6 fatty acid|ω-6]] [[PUFA]]) to [[Prostaglandin H2|prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub>]] (PGH<sub>2</sub>), the precursor of the series-2 [[prostanoid]]s. The enzyme contains two active sites: a [[heme]] with [[peroxidase]] activity, responsible for the reduction of PGG<sub>2</sub> to PGH<sub>2</sub>, and a  cyclooxygenase site, where arachidonic acid is converted into the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G<sub>2</sub> (PGG<sub>2</sub>). The reaction proceeds through H atom abstraction from arachidonic acid by a tyrosine radical generated by the [[peroxidase]] active site. Two O<sub>2</sub> molecules then react with the arachidonic [[acid radical]], yielding PGG<sub>2</sub>.

At present, three ''COX'' [[isoenzyme]]s are known: ''[[PTGS1|COX-1]]'', ''[[COX-2]]'', and ''[[COX-3]]''. ''COX-3'' is a [[Splicing (genetics)|splice variant]] of COX-1, which retains [[intron]] one and has a [[frameshift mutation]]; thus some prefer the name ''COX-1b'' or ''COX-1 variant'' (''COX-1v'').<ref name="pmid12242329">{{cite journal | author = Chandrasekharan NV, Dai H, Roos KL, Evanson NK, Tomsik J, Elton TS, Simmons DL | title = COX-3, a cyclooxygenase-1 variant inhibited by acetaminophen and other analgesic/antipyretic drugs: Cloning, structure, and expression | journal = Proc.

Different tissues express varying levels of ''COX-1'' and ''COX-2''. Although both enzymes act basically in the same fashion, selective inhibition can make a difference in side-effects. ''COX-1'' is considered a [[constitutive enzyme]], being found in most mammalian cells. ''COX-2'', on the other hand, is undetectable in most normal tissues. It is an [[adaptive enzyme|inducible enzyme]], becoming abundant in activated [[macrophage]]s and other cells at sites of inflammation. More recently, it has been shown to be upregulated in various carcinomas and to have a central role in tumorigenesis.

Both COX-1 and -2 (also known as PGHS-1 and -2) also oxygenate two other essential fatty acids &ndash; [[Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid|DGLA]] (ω-6) and [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] (ω-3) &ndash; to give the series-1 and series-3 prostanoids, which are less [[inflammation|inflammatory]] than those of series-2.  DGLA and EPA are [[competitive inhibitor]]s with AA for the COX pathways.  This inhibition is a major mode of action in the way that dietary sources of DGLA and EPA (e.g., [[borage]], [[fish oil]]) reduce inflammation.<ref name="pmid12480795">{{cite journal | author = Simopoulos AP | title = Omega-3 fatty acids in inflammation and autoimmune diseases | journal = J Am Coll Nutr | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 495–505 | year = 2002 | month = December | pmid = 12480795 | doi = }}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==

In terms of their molecular biology, ''COX-1'' and ''COX-2'' are of similar molecular weight, approximately 70 and 72 k[[dalton (unit)|Da]], respectively, and having 65% amino acid sequence homology and near-identical catalytic sites. The most significant difference between the isoenzymes, which allows for selective inhibition, is the substitution of [[isoleucine]] at position 523 in ''COX-1'' with [[valine]] in ''COX-2''. The smaller Val<sub>523</sub> residue in ''COX-2'' allows access to a [[hydrophobic]] side-pocket in the enzyme (which Ile<sub>523</sub> sterically hinders). Drug molecules, such as DuP-697 and the coxibs derived from it, bind to this alternative site and are considered to be selective inhibitors of ''COX-2''.

=== Classical NSAIDs ===

{{See also|Mechanism of action of aspirin}}
The main ''COX'' inhibitors are the [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs).

The classical ''COX'' inhibitors are not selective and inhibit all types of ''COX''. The resulting inhibition of [[prostaglandin]] and [[thromboxane]] synthesis has the effect of reduced inflammation, as well as antipyretic, antithrombotic and analgesic effects. The most frequent adverse effect of NSAIDs is irritation of the gastric mucosa as [[prostaglandin]]s normally have a protective role in the gastrointestinal tract. Some NSAIDs are also acidic which may cause additional damage to the gastrointestinal tract.

=== Newer NSAIDs ===

Selectivity for ''COX-2'' is the main feature of [[celecoxib]], [[rofecoxib]], and other members of this drug class.  Because COX-2 is usually specific to inflamed tissue, there is much less gastric irritation associated with COX-2 inhibitors, with a decreased risk of peptic ulceration. The selectivity of COX-2 does not seem to negate other side-effects of NSAIDs, most notably an increased risk of [[renal failure]], and there is evidence that indicates an increase in the risk for [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[thrombosis]], and [[stroke]] through an increase of [[thromboxane]] unbalanced by prostacyclin (which is reduced by COX-2 inhibition). {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} [[Rofecoxib]] (brand name [[Vioxx]]) was withdrawn in 2004 because of such concerns. Some other COX-2 selective NSAIDs, such as [[celecoxib]], and [[etoricoxib]], are still on the market.

=== Cardiovascular side-effects of COX inhibitors ===

''COX-2'' inhibitors have been found to increase the risk of [[Thrombosis|atherothrombosis]] even with short-term use. A 2006 analysis of 138 randomised trials and almost 150 000 participants<ref name="pmid16740558">{{cite journal | author = Kearney PM, Baigent C, Godwin J, Halls H, Emberson JR, Patrono C | title = Do selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of atherothrombosis?

Fish oils have been proposed as a reasonable alternative for the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] e.g. cod liver oil and other conditions as a consequence of the fact that they provide less cardiovascular risk than other treatments including NSAIDs.<ref name='fish oils'/>
