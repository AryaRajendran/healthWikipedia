A '''fetus''' ({{IPA-en|ˈfiːtəs|pron}}; also spelled '''''foetus''''', '''''fœtus''''', '''''faetus''''', or '''''fætus''''', see below) is a developing [[mammal]] or other [[viviparous]] [[vertebrate]] after the [[embryo]]nic stage and before [[childbirth|birth]]. 

In humans, the fetal stage of [[prenatal development]] starts at the beginning of the 11th week in [[gestational age]], which is the 9th week after [[fertilization]].<ref name="nursing">Klossner, N.

==Etymology==
The word ''fetus'' (plural ''fetuses'') is from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:fetus#Latin|fētus]]'' (“offspring”, “bringing forth”, “hatching of young”).<ref>Harper, Douglas. (2001). ''[http://etymonline.com/ Online Etymology Dictionary]''. Retrieved 2007-01-20.</ref>

''Fœtus'' or ''foetus'' is the British, Irish and Commonwealth spelling, which has been in use since at least 1594.<ref name=OED>{{Cite journal|title=Foetus|volume=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50087237|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> It arose as a [[hypercorrection]] based on an incorrect etymology (i.e. due to insufficient knowledge of Latin) that may have originated with an error by [[Saint Isidore of Seville]], in AD 620.<ref name="Br Med J">{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = W.J. | title = Foetus—or Foetus? | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue =5537 | date = 18 February 1967 | pmc = 1841520 | pmid = }}</ref><ref name=BMJ>{{cite journal | last = Aronson | first = Jeff | title = When I use a word...:Oe no! | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 315 | issue =7102 | date = 26 July 1997 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7102/0.9|accessdate=25 September 2012 }}</ref> This spelling is the most common in most Commonwealth nations (except in the medical literature, where fetus is used). The etymologically accurate original spelling, ''fetus'', is used in Canada and the United States.

===Variation in growth===
{{see also|Birth weight}}
There is much variation in the growth of the human fetus. When fetal size is less than expected, that condition is known as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) also called fetal growth restriction (FGR); factors affecting fetal growth can be ''maternal'', ''[[placenta]]l'', or ''fetal''.<ref name="Holden">Holden, Chris and MacDonald, Anita. ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN070202421X&id=EUXbcmfcADYC&pg=RA2-PA174&lpg=RA2-PA174&ots=_-wbxFW87C&dq=%22growth%22+and+variation+and+fetus+and+%22placental+factors%22+and+%22maternal+factors%22+and+%22fetal+factors%22&num=100&sig=0jIpH8JKU_2TDllfpRuCjcFgD1I Nutrition and Child Health]'' (Elsevier 2000). Retrieved 2007-03-04.</ref>

'''Maternal''' factors include maternal [[weight]], [[body mass index]], nutritional state, emotional [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], toxin exposure (including [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]], [[heroin]], and other drugs which can also harm the fetus in other ways), and [[uterus|uterine]] [[blood]] flow.

'''Placental''' factors include size, microstructure (densities and architecture), [[umbilical cord|umbilical]] blood flow, transporters and binding proteins, nutrient utilization and nutrient production.

'''Fetal''' factors include the fetus genome, nutrient production, and [[hormone]] output. Also, female fetuses tend to weigh less than males, at full term.<ref name="Holden"/>

Fetal growth is often classified as follows: small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA), and large for gestational age (LGA).<ref>Queenan, John. ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0632043326&id=sfp-OzoU6X4C&pg=RA2-PA6&lpg=RA2-PA6&ots=otwaM0KidM&dq=sga+aga+lga+growth+factors+placental&num=100&sig=bzteZcizgLWVNg6heQ7QWnLur3A#PRA2-PA6,M1 Management of High-Risk Pregnancy]'' (Blackwell 1999). Retrieved 2007-03-04.</ref> SGA can result in [[low birth weight]], although premature birth can also result in low birth weight. Low birth weight increases risk for perinatal mortality ([[death]] shortly after birth), [[asphyxia]], [[hypothermia]], [[polycythemia]], [[hypocalcemia]], [[immune dysfunction]], [[neurologic]] abnormalities, and other long-term health problems. SGA may be associated with growth delay, or it may instead be associated with absolute stunting of growth.

==Viability==

{{wide image|Prenatal development table.svg|1850px|Stages in [[prenatal development]], showing viability and point of 50% chance of survival at bottom. Weeks and months numbered [[gestational age|by gestation]].}}

Viability refers to a point in fetal development at which the human fetus may survive outside the womb.  The lower limit of [[Viability (fetal)|viability]] is approximately five months [[gestational age]], and usually later.<ref>Halamek, Louis.

==Fetal pain==
{{main|Fetal pain}}

Fetal [[pain]], its existence, and its implications are debated politically and academically. According to the conclusions of a review published in 2005, "Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester."<ref name="JAMA">{{cite journal | last = Lee | first = Susan | title = Fetal Pain A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence | journal = The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 294 | issue = 8 | date = August 24/31, 2005 | publisher = the American Medical Association| url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/294/8/947 | accessdate = 2008-02-14 | pmid = 16118385 | doi = 10.1001/jama.294.8.947 | pages = 947–54 | last2 = Ralston | first2 = HJ | last3 = Drey | first3 = EA | last4 = Partridge | first4 = JC | last5 = Rosen | first5 = MA }} Two authors of the study published in JAMA did not report their abortion-related activities, which pro-life groups called a conflict of interest; the editor of JAMA responded that JAMA probably would have mentioned those activities if they had been disclosed, but still would have published the study.

==Circulatory system==
{{main|Fetal circulation}}
[[Image:Fetal circulation.png|thumb|right|220px|Diagram of the human [[fetal circulatory system]].]]
The [[circulatory system]] of a human fetus works differently to that of born humans, mainly because the lungs are not in use: the fetus obtains [[oxygen]] and nutrients from the woman through the [[placenta]] and the [[umbilical cord]].<ref name="Whitaker">Whitaker, Kent. ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0766813738&id=R3WK8XyAHYgC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&ots=wcft0RkRxg&dq=%22fetal+circulatory+system%22&sig=_DSt-D7pBSBtikfJ5oQKYVlNKmU Comprehensive Perinatal and Pediatric Respiratory Care]'' (Delmar 2001). Retrieved 2007-03-04.</ref>

Blood from the placenta is carried to the fetus by the [[umbilical vein]]. About half of this enters the fetal ''[[ductus venosus]]'' and is carried to the [[inferior vena cava]], while the other half enters the [[liver]] proper from the inferior border of the liver. The branch of the umbilical vein that supplies the right lobe of the liver first joins with the [[portal vein]]. The blood then moves to the right atrium of the [[heart]]. In the fetus, there is an opening between the right and left atrium (the ''[[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]]''), and most of the blood flows from the right into the left atrium, thus bypassing [[pulmonary circulation]]. The majority of blood flow is into the left ventricle from where it is pumped through the [[aorta]] into the body. Some of the blood moves from the aorta through the internal iliac arteries to the umbilical arteries, and re-enters the placenta, where [[carbon dioxide]] and other waste products from the fetus are taken up and enter the woman's circulation.<ref name="Whitaker"/>

Some of the blood from the right atrium does not enter the left atrium, but enters the right ventricle and is pumped into the [[pulmonary artery]]. In the fetus, there is a special connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, called the ''[[ductus arteriosus]]'', which directs most of this blood away from the lungs (which aren't being used for respiration at this point as the fetus is suspended in [[amniotic fluid]]).<ref name="Whitaker"/>

===Postnatal development===
{{Main|Adaptation to extrauterine life}}

With the first breath after birth, the system changes suddenly. The pulmonary resistance is dramatically reduced ("pulmo" is from the Latin for "[[lung]]"). More blood moves from the right atrium to the right ventricle and into the pulmonary arteries, and less flows through the ''[[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]]'' to the left atrium. The blood from the lungs travels through the pulmonary veins to the left atrium, increasing the pressure there. The decreased right atrial pressure and the increased left atrial pressure pushes the ''septum primum'' against the ''septum secundum'', closing the ''foramen ovale'', which now becomes the ''fossa ovalis''. This completes the separation of the circulatory system into two halves, the left and the right.

The ''ductus arteriosus'' normally closes off within one or two days of birth, leaving behind the ligamentum arteriosum. The umbilical vein and the ductus venosus closes off within two to five days after birth, leaving behind the ''[[ligamentum teres]]'' and the ''[[ligamentum venosus]]'' of the liver respectively.

===Differences from the adult circulatory system===
Remnants of the fetal circulation can be found in adults:<ref>Dudek, Ronald and Fix, James. ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0781757266&id=LGcI-FVCruEC&pg=RA1-PA54&lpg=RA1-PA54&ots=2h9BlGiwkB&dq=%22Remnants+of+fetal+circulatory%22&sig=FFhRCd92q-wfUbGgR81vu62sBMA#PRA1-PA54,M1 Board Review Series Embryology]'' (Lippincott 2004).

In addition to differences in circulation, the developing fetus also employs a different type of oxygen [[transport protein|transport molecule]] than adults (adults use [[hemoglobin|adult hemoglobin]]). [[Fetal hemoglobin]] enhances the fetus' ability to draw oxygen from the placenta. Its dissociation curve to oxygen is shifted to the left, meaning that it will take up oxygen at a lower concentration than adult hemoglobin will. This enables fetal hemoglobin to absorb oxygen from adult hemoglobin in the placenta, which has a lower pressure of oxygen than at the lungs.

==Immune system==
The [[placenta]] functions as a selective [[maternal-fetal barrier]] against transmission of [[microbe]]s. However, insufficiency in this function may still cause [[mother-to-child transmission]] of infectious diseases.

Also, maternal [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG antibodies]] cross the placenta, giving the fetus [[passive immunity]] against diseases for which the mother has antibodies. This transfer of antibodies begin as early as the 20th week of gestational age, and certainly by the 24th week.<ref>[http://books.google.se/books?id=apeLf0mPx1QC&pg=PA202 Page 202] in: {{cite book |author=Pillitteri, Adele |title=Maternal and Child Health Nursing: Care of the Childbearing and Childrearing Family |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=1-58255-999-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Developmental problems==

{{see also|Congenital disorder}}
Congenital anomalies are anomalies that are acquired before birth. Infants with certain congenital anomalies of the heart can survive only as long as the ductus remains open: in such cases the closure of the ductus can be delayed by the administration of [[prostaglandin]]s to permit sufficient time for the surgical correction of the anomalies. Conversely, in cases of [[patent ductus arteriosus]], where the ductus does not properly close, drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis can be used to encourage its closure, so that surgery can be avoided.

A developing fetus is highly susceptible to anomalies in its growth and metabolism, increasing the risk of birth defects. One area of concern is the pregnant woman's lifestyle choices made during pregnancy.<ref>Dalby, JT. (1978).''Environmental effects on prenatal development'' Journal of Pediatric Psychology, 3, 105-109.</ref> Diet is especially important in the early stages of development. Studies show that supplementation of the woman's diet with [[folic acid]] reduces the risk of [[spina bifida]] and other [[neural tube]] defects. Another dietary concern is whether the woman eats breakfast. Skipping breakfast could lead to extended periods of lower than normal nutrients in the woman's blood, leading to a higher risk of [[Preterm birth|prematurity]], or other birth defects in the fetus. During this time alcohol consumption may increase the risk of the development of [[Fetal alcohol syndrome]], a condition leading to [[mental retardation]] in some infants.<ref>{{cite book |author=Streissguth, Ann Pytkowicz |title=Fetal alcohol syndrome: a guide for families and communities |publisher=Paul H Brookes Pub |location=Baltimore, MD |year=1997 |isbn=1-55766-283-5 }}</ref>
[[smoking and pregnancy|Smoking during pregnancy]] may also lead to reduced birth weight. Low birth weight is defined as 2500&nbsp;grams (5.5&nbsp;lb). Low birth weight is a concern for medical providers due to the tendency of these infants, described as ''premature'' by weight, to have a higher risk of secondary medical problems. Some research shows that fetal ultrasounds (including Doppler, 3D/4D ultrasound, and 2D ultrasound) can have negative effect on birth weight and neurodevelopment.<ref>http://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/ultrasoundrodgers.asp</ref>

==Legal issues==
[[Abortion law|Abortion of a pregnancy is legal]] and/or tolerated due to facets of the physician-patient relationship in many countries such as Australia, India, Canada, most European countries, and the United States. Many of those countries that allow abortion during the fetal stage have gestational time limits, so that [[Late-term abortion#Legal restrictions on later abortion|late-term abortions are not normally allowed]].<ref>Anika Rahman, Laura Katzive and Stanley K. Henshaw.
