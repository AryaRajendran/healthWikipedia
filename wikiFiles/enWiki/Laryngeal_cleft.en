==Symptoms and diagnosis==
Diagnosis of a laryngeal cleft in an infant often comes after problems with feeding which include coughing, [[cyanosis]] (blue skin) and failing to gain weight over time.<ref name=Cherry /> [[Lung|Pulmonary]] infections are also common.<ref name=Bluestone>{{Cite book

</ref> Laryngeal clefts are classified into four types according to length. Type&nbsp;I extends no further down than the [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]], type&nbsp;II extends below the vocal cords and into the [[cricoid cartilage]], type&nbsp;III extends into the [[neck|cervical]] section of the trachea and type&nbsp;IV extends the furthest—into the [[chest|thoracic]] section of the trachea.<ref name=Graham />
==Treatment==
Treatment of a laryngeal cleft depends on the length and resulting severity of symptoms. A shorter cleft (type&nbsp;I) may not require surgical intervention.<ref name=Graham /> Symptoms can be managed by thickening the infant's feeds.<ref name=Graham /> A slightly longer cleft (long type&nbsp;I or shorter type&nbsp;II) is repaired endoscopically. A cleft that is longer still (type&nbsp;II or type&nbsp;III) is repaired directly through the neck, with a [[tracheotomy]].<ref name=Graham />
==Associated conditions==
20–27% of individuals with a laryngeal cleft also have a [[tracheoesophageal fistula]] and approximately 6% of individuals with the  fistula also have the cleft.<ref name=Bluestone /> Other congenital anomalies commonly associated with laryngeal cleft are [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|gastro-oesophageal reflux]], [[tracheobronchomalacia]], [[congenital heart defect]], [[dextrocardia]] and [[situs inversus]].<ref name=Graham /> Laryngeal cleft can be a component of other genetic syndromes, including [[Pallister-Hall syndrome]] and [[G syndrome]] ([[Opitz-Friaz syndrome]]).<ref name=Bluestone />
