'''Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor''' ('''AT/RT''') is a rare [[tumor]] usually diagnosed in childhood.  Although usually a [[brain tumor]], AT/RT can occur anywhere in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) including the [[spinal cord]].  About 60% will be in the [[posterior cranial fossa]] (particularly the [[cerebellum]]).  One review estimated 52% posterior fossa, 39% sPNET ([[supratentorial]] [[primitive neuroectodermal tumor]]s), 5% [[pineal gland|pineal]], 2% [[Spinal tumor|spinal]], and 2% multi-focal.<ref name="Kieran">{{cite journal

In the United States, three children per 1,000,000 or around 30 new AT/RT cases are diagnosed each year.  AT/RT represents around 3% of pediatric [[cancer]]s of the CNS.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/envirohealth/children/child_illness/d6-graph.htm Measure D6:  Types of Childhood Cancer] – 2006 Tables D6a & D6b.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  Retrieved on 2008-04-17.</ref>
Around 17% of all pediatric cancers involve the CNS; it is the most common childhood solid tumor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  The survival rate for CNS tumors is around 60%; with AT/RT it is around 10%.  Pediatric brain cancer is the second leading cause of childhood death, just after [[leukemia]].  Recent trends suggest that the rate of overall CNS tumor diagnosis is increasing by about 2.7% per year.  As diagnostic techniques using genetic markers improve and are used more often, the proportion of AT/RT diagnoses is expected to increase.

Because it is highly [[cancer|malignant]], AT/RT has a high [[mortality rate]].  A survey of 36 AT/RT patients at [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] from 1984 to 2003 showed that the two-year event-free survival for children under three was 11%, the overall survival rate was 17%. For children aged 3 years or older the event-free survival was 78% and the overall survival 89%.<ref name="jco.ascopubs.org">{{cite journal |author=Tekautz TM, Fuller CE, Blaney S, ''et al.'' |title=Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (ATRT): improved survival in children 3 years of age and older with radiation therapy and high-dose alkylator-based chemotherapy |journal=[[J.

Oncol.]] |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=1491–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15735125 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2005.05.187 |url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/full/23/7/1491}} See Figure 1.</ref>  Because most patients with AT/RT are less than three years old (71% in St Jude Study), the overall prognosis for AT/RT is very poor.

Current research is focusing on using [[chemotherapy]] protocols that are effective against [[rhabdomyosarcoma]] in combination with surgery and radiation therapy.

==Classification==
AT/RT may be related to [[rhabdoid tumour|malignant rhabdoid tumor]] (MRT), which occurs outside the CNS, usually in the kidney.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The finding that AT/RT and MRT both have deletions of the INI1 gene{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} indicates that rhabdoid tumors of the kidney and brain are at least closely related. AT/RT and MRT also have similar [[histology]] and similar clinical and demographic features. Moreover, 10–15% of MRT patients have simultaneous or subsequent brain tumors, many of which are secondary or primary MRT.

==Signs and symptoms==

Clinical signs and symptoms depend on the location of the tumor.

Since many of the tumors occur in the [[Posterior cranial fossa|posterior fossa]] they present like other posterior fossa tumors, often with headache, vomiting, [[fatigue (medical)|lethargy]], and [[ataxia]] (unsteady gait).  There is a case report of a seven-month-old child with a primarily [[spinal tumor]] that presented with progressive [[paraplegia]] and abnormal feeling in the legs.<ref>

==Genetics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}
[[genetics|Genetic]] similarities have been found within rhabdoid tumors.  In particular the [[Chromosome|chromosomal]] [[22q11.2 deletion syndrome|22 deletion]] is very common in AT/RTs.  The [[chromosome 22]] area contains the hSNF5/INI1 [[gene]] that appears to function as a classic [[tumor suppressor]] gene.<ref>
{{cite journal |author=Chung-Lan Kao, Shih-Hwa Chiou, Yann-Jang Chen, Sher Singh, Han-Tso Lin, Ren-Shyan Liu, Chih-Wen Lo, Chi-Chang Yang, Chin-Wen Chi, Chen-hsen Lee and Tai-Tong Wong |title=Increased expression of osteopontin gene in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the central nervous system |journal=Modern Pathology |volume=18 |issue= 6 |pages=769–778 |year=2005 |accessdate = 2008-05-05 |url=http://www.nature.com/modpathol/journal/v18/n6/full/3800270a.html |doi=10.1038/modpathol.3800270 |pmid=15776015}}</ref> Most rhabdoid tumors have INI1 deletions whether they occur in the CNS, kidney or elsewhere.  This [[mutation]] is viewed as the "first hit" which predisposes children to malignancies.  INI1/hSNF5, a component of the [[chromatin]] remodeling SWI/SNF complex, is a critical tumor suppressor biallelically inactivated in rhabdoid tumors. Identification of INI1 as a tumor suppressor has facilitated accurate diagnosis of rhabdoid tumors.
 
The rate of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] for SWI/SNF and [[Histone deacetylase|HDAC]] complexes seem to be regulated by the INI1 gene.  The SWI/SNF complex plays a role in chromatin remodeling.  AT/RT is the first pediatric brain tumor for which a candidate tumor suppressor gene has been identified. A mutation or deletion in the INI1/hSNF5 gene occurs in the majority of AT/RT tumors.  Up to 90% of AT/RT cases involve chromosome 22 deletion.  This is mainly point mutations on the hSNF5/INI1 gene (i.e., one can diagnosis AT/RT without a chromosome 22 deletion elsewhere).  The [[SWI/SNF|hSNF5/INI1]] gene regulates 15 or so proteins in the chromatin structure.  In addition, the OPN gene has a higher expression in AT/RT tumors. It is increasingly believed that the reason that all of the AT/RT cancers are not associated with the hSNF5/INI1 gene is that there are 14 additional proteins in the chromatin structure that are controlled by other genes.  There are also some emerging mouse models of the AT/RT cancer as well as experimental cell lines derived from tumors.  Despite these advances, the function of the gene is not yet understood. There is not enough known about the function of INI1, either as an independent modulator of gene expression or through its association with the [[SWI/SNF]] complex, to be able to use specific targeted biological agents for treatment.  Prospective clinical and biologic trials are greatly needed to understand the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, as well as the role of the gene.

=== Risk for siblings and other members of the family===
Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors are very rare tumors and absolute risk to siblings is not reported in the literature.  However, there have been some reports of AT/RTs presenting in two members of the same family, or one family member with an AT/RT and another with a renal rhabdoid tumor or other CNS tumor.  These are suspected to arise from [[Germline|germ-line]] genetic mutations in a parent shared by affected siblings.

*A three-generation family is known in which two half-brothers were diagnosed with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT). The two boys, diagnosed at 2 months and 17 months of age, had a germline insertion mutation in exon 4 of the INI1 gene that was inherited from their healthy mother. A maternal uncle died in childhood from a brain tumor and a malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney.  The identification of two unaffected carriers in a family segregating a germline mutation and rhabdoid tumor supports the hypothesis that there may be variable risks of development of rhabdoid tumor in the context of a germline mutation. There may be a developmental window in which most rhabdoid tumors occur. This family highlights the importance of mutation analysis in all patients with a suspected rhabdoid tumor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Janson K, Nedzi LA, David O, ''et al.'' |title=Predisposition to atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor due to an inherited INI1 mutation |journal=Pediatr Blood Cancer |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=279–84 |year=2006 |pmid=16261613 |doi=10.1002/pbc.20622}}</ref>

==Pathology==

[[Pathology]] is the study and [[diagnosis]] of [[disease]] through examination of [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[bodily fluid]]s and whole bodies ([[Autopsy]]).  AT/RT and rhabdoid tumor share the term "rhabdoid" because under a microscope both tumors resemble [[rhabdomyosarcoma]].[[Image:ATRT-HE-Overview.jpg|thumb|right|AT/RT Histology with numerous rhabdoid tumor cells]][[Image:Rhabdoidtumourcell.jpg|thumb|right|Rhabdoid Tumor Cell - 400X Magnification]]

===Histology===
[[Histology]] is the study of the [[anatomy|microscopic anatomy]] of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. It is performed by examining a thin slice of tissue under a [[light microscope]]. The tumor [[histopathology]] is jumbled small and large cells.  The [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] of this tumor contains many different types of cells including the rhabdoid cells, large spindled cell, [[Epithelial reticular cells|epithelial]] and mesenchymal cells and areas resembling [[primitive neuroectodermal tumor]] (PNET).  As much as 70% of the tumor may be made up of PNET-like cells.  [[Ultrastructure]] characteristic whorls of [[intermediate filament]]s in the [[rhabdoid tumor]]s (as with rhabdoid tumors in any area of the body).  Ho and associates found sickle-shaped embracing cells, previously unreported, in all of 11 cases of AT/RT.<ref name="pmid10805090">{{cite journal |author=Ho DM, Hsu CY, Wong TT, Ting LT, Chiang H |title=Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the central nervous system: a comparative study with primitive neuroectodermal tumor/medulloblastoma |journal=Acta Neuropathol. |volume=99 |issue=5 |pages=482–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10805090 |doi= 10.1007/s004010051149|url=}}</ref>

===Immunohistochemistry===
[[Image:ATRT-INI1.jpg|thumb|[[Immunohistochemistry]] for INI1, the product of the SMARCB1 gene typically defective in ATRT. Note loss of brown staining in the nuclei of tumor cells with defective SMARCB1 as compared to retained staining of nuclei of vascular cells (internal positive control).]]
[[Immunohistochemistry]] refers to the process of localizing proteins in cells of a tissue section exploiting the principle of antibodies binding specifically to antigens in biological tissues.  A tissue sample is stained to identify specific cellular proteins.  Immunohistochemical staining is widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Specific molecular markers are characteristic of particular cancer types. Immunohistochemistry is also widely used in basic research to understand the distribution and localization of biomarkers in different parts of a tissue.  Proteins found in an Atypical Teratoid Rhaboid Tumor are:

*[[Vimentin]]-positive
*[[Cytokeratin]]-positive
*Neuron specific enolase-positive
*Epitelial membrane antigen-positive
*[[Glial fibrillary acidic protein]]- positive

====Cytogenetic studies====
[[Cytogenetic]]s is the study of a tumor’s genetic make-up.  A technique called [[fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]] may be able to help locate a mutation or abnormality that may be allowing tumor growth.<ref name="pmid11230702">{{cite journal 
|author=Bruch LA, Hill DA, Cai DX, Levy BK, Dehner LP, Perry A |title=A role for fluorescence in situ hybridization detection of chromosome 22q dosage in distinguishing atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors from medulloblastoma/central primitive neuroectodermal tumors |journal=Hum. Pathol. |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=156–62 |year=2001 |pmid=11230702 |doi=10.1053/hupa.2001.21572 
|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0046-8177(01)87801-1}}</ref>  This technique has been shown to be useful in identifying some tumors and distinguishing two histologically similar tumors from each other (such as AT/RTs and PNETs). In particular, medulloblastmas/PNETs may possibly be differentiated cytogenetically from AT/RTs as chromosomal deletions of 17p are relatively common with medulloblastoma and abnormalities of 22q11.2 are not seen.  On the other hand, chromosomal 22 deletions are very comomon in AT/RTs.

In importance of the hSNF5/INI1 gene located on chromosomal band 22q11.2 is highlighted in the summary paper form the Workshop on Childhood Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors as the mutation’s presence is sufficient to change the diagnosis from a medulloblastoma or PNET to the more aggressive AT/RT classification. However, it should be noted that this mutation is not present in 100% of cases.  Therefore, if the mutation is not present in an otherwise classic AT/RT immunohistochemical and morphologic pattern then the diagnosis remains an AT/RT.

==Diagnosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}
The standard work-up for AT/RT includes:

* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of the brain and spine
* [[Lumbar puncture]] to look for M1 disease
* [[Computed tomography]] (CT) of chest and abdomen to check for a tumor
* [[Bone marrow examination|Bone marrow aspiration]] to check for bone tumors.  Sometimes the physician will perform a [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|stem cell transplant]]
* [[Bone marrow examination|Bone marrow biopsy]]
* [[Bone scan]]

The initial diagnosis of a tumor is made with a [[Medical radiography|radiographic]] study ([[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]]<ref>
{{cite journal |author=Meyers SP, Khademianc ZP, Biegeld JA, Chuange SH, Koronesb DN, Zimmerman RA |title=Primary Intracranial Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumors of Infancy and Childhood: MRI Features and Patient Outcomes |journal=American Journal of Neuroradiology |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=962–971 |year=2006 |month=May |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/content/full/27/5/962 | accessdate = 2008-05-05 |pmid=16687525 }}</ref> or [[Computed Tomography|CT]]-). If CT was performed first, an MRI is usually performed as the images are often more detailed and may reveal previously undetected [[Metastasis|metastatic]] tumors in other locations of the brain.  In addition, an MRI of the [[Vertebral column|spine]] is usually performed. The AT/RT tumor often spreads to the spine.  It is difficult to diagnose AT/RT only from radiographic study; usually a pathologist must perform a cytological or genetic analysis.

Examination of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) is important as one-third of patients will have intracranial dissemination with involvement of the CSF. Large tumor cells, eccentricity of the nuclei and prominent nucleoli are consistent findings.<ref>{{cite journal

Increasingly it is recommended that a genetic analysis be performed on the brain tumor, especially to find if a deletion in the INI1/hSNF5 gene is involved (appears to account for over 80% of the cases).  The correct diagnosis of the tumor is critical to any protocol.  Studies have shown that 8% to over 50% of AT/RT tumors are diagnosed incorrectly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Differential diagnosis===

The critical step in treatment planning is to determine the correct histology of the tumor.  Misidentification of the tumor histology can lead to errors in treatment and prognosis.<ref>{{cite journal

</ref> [[primitive neuroectodermal tumor]], [[choroid plexus carcinoma]], and some kinds of [[germ cell tumor]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}<!-- which kinds of germ cell tumor? -->  Because rhabdoid characteristics<!-- defined above? --> are not the only component of AT/RT, some sections of an AT/RT may resemble other tumors.  These characteristics may be present only in focal areas or may be less pronounced.

It is important to consider AT/RT when a medulloblastoma or PNET is suspected, particularly in a child under the age of one.  [[Cytogenetics|Cytogenetic]] studies can assist in differentiating MB/PNETs from AT/RTs.  Some kinds of [[germ cell tumor]] secrete [[tumor marker]]s [[Alpha-fetoprotein|AFP]] or [[bHCG]]; AT/RTs do not.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

<!-- move this paragraph to Prognosis? -->
Compared to medulloblastoma, AT/RT has a significantly worse prognosis.  AT/RT occurs in young children (often younger than three years) who are difficult to evaluate, it is resistant to many current therapies, and its recurrence is fast.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Appearance on radiologic exam===

AT/RTs can occur at any sites within the CNS; however, approximately 60% are located in the posterior fossa or cerebellar area.  The ASCO study showed 52% posterior fossa; 39% sPNET ([[supratentorial]] primitive neuroectodermal tumors); 5% [[Pineal gland|pineal]]; 2% [[Spinal tumor|spinal]], and 2% multi-focal.<ref name="Kieran"/> 

The tumors' appearance on CT and MRI are nonspecific, tending towards large size, [[Metastatic calcification|calcifications]], [[Necrosis|necrosis (tissue death)]],and hemorrhage (bleeding). Radiological studies alone cannot identify AT/RT; a pathologist almost always has to evaluate a brain tissue sample.
  
The increased cellularity of the tumor may make the appearance on  an uncontrasted CT to have increased attenuation.  Solid parts of the tumor often enhance with contrast MRI finding on [[Relaxation (NMR)|T1 and T2]] weighted images are variable.  Pre-contrast T2 weighted images may show an iso-signal or slightly hyper-signal. Solid components of the tumor may enhance with contrast but do not always. MRI studies appear to be more able to pick up metastatic foci in other intracranial locations as well as intraspinal locations.

Preoperative and follow-up studies are needed to detect metastatic disease.

==Treatment==

===Surgery===
[[Surgery]] plays a critical role in obtaining [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] to make an accurate [[diagnosis]].  Surgery alone is curative.  In addition, 30% of the AT/RTs are located supratentorially and there is a predilection for the cerebello-pontine angle<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utmb.edu/otoref/Grnds/Mass-CPA-040602/Mass-CPA-slides-040602.pdf |title=PDF |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref> which makes surgical resection difficult. One-third or more children will have [[disseminated disease]] at the time of diagnosis. Total or near-total resections are often not possible.

===Chemotherapy===
Approximately 50% of the AT/RTs will transiently respond, but [[Chemotherapy]] by itself is rarely curative.  There is no standard treatment for AT/RT.  Various chemotherapeutic agents have been used against AT/RTs which are also used against other CNS tumors including [[cisplatin]]um, [[carboplatinum]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[vincristine]] and [[etoposide]].  Some [[chemotherapy regimens|Chemotherapy protocols]] are listed below:

Survival was comparable to that of previous studies, and most patients who survived did not receive radiation therapy.<ref name="Geyer" />

*[[Sarcoma]] protocols. There has been at least one report in the literature of malignant rhabdoid tumors of the CNS being treated in as a high-grade intracranial [[sarcoma]].  These three cases were treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and triple [[intrathecal]] chemotherapy similar to the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study III guidelines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/childrhabdomyosarcoma/healthprofessional/ |title=Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment|publisher= National Cancer Institute |accessdate=2007-07-09 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070704092544/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/childrhabdomyosarcoma/healthprofessional/| archivedate= 4 July 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
 
* [[Intrathecal]] protocols. One of the difficulties with brain and spinal tumors is that the [[blood brain barrier]] needs to be crossed so that the drug can get to the tumor.  One mechanism to deliver the drug is through a device called an [[Ommaya reservoir]].  This is a device which shares some characteristics with a shunt in which a tube a surgically placed in the fluid surrounding the brain and a bulb shaped reservoir attached to the tubing is placed under the skin of the scalp.  When the child is to receive [[intrathecal]] [[chemotherapy]], the drug is administered into this bulb reservoir.   At other times intrathecal chemotherapeutic agents are delivered through a [[lumbar puncture]] (spinal tap). A current Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium [[Chemotherapy regimens|Protocol]] uses intrathecal [[mafosfamide]], a pre-activated [[cyclophosphamide]]derivative, in addition to other modalities to try to effect this tumor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poussaint TY, Phillips PC, Vajapeyam S, ''et al.'' |title=The Neuroimaging Center of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium-collaborative neuroimaging in pediatric brain tumor research: a work in progress |journal=AJNR.  American journal of neuroradiology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=603–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17416804 |doi=}}</ref>

* High dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. This therapy uses chemotherapy at doses high enough to completely suppress the [[bone marrow]].  Prior to instituting this therapy, the child has a [[Central venous catheter|central line]] placed and [[stem cell]]s are gathered.  After therapy these cells are given back to the child to [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|regrow the bone marrow]].  Stem cell rescue or [[autologous]] [[bone marrow transplantation]], was initially thought to be of benefit to a wide group of patients, but has declined over the [[History of cancer chemotherapy|history of chemotherapy]] protocols.

===Radiation therapy===
The traditional practice for childhood brain tumors has been to use chemotherapy and to defer [[radiation therapy]] until a child is older than three years.  This strategy is based upon observations that children under three have significant long term complications as a result of brain irradiation.  However, the long term outcomes of AT/RT are so poor that some protocols call for upfront radiation therapy, often in spite of young age.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Squire SE, Chan MD, Marcus KJ |title=Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor: the controversy behind radiation therapy |journal=J. Neurooncol. |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=97–111 |year=2007 |pmid=16855864 |doi=10.1007/s11060-006-9196-z}}</ref>

The dose and volume of radiation had not been standardized, however, radiation does appear to improve survival.  The use of radiation has been limited in children younger than three because of the risk of severe neurocognitive deficits.   There are protocols using conformal, local radiation in the young child to try to cure this tumor.

[[External beam radiotherapy|External beam]] (conformal) radiation uses several beams that intersect at the tumor location; the normal brain tissue receives less radiation and cognitive function is thereby less affected.
 
[[Proton therapy|Proton beam radiation]] was only offered at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in Boston and at Loma Linda, California as of 2002. Since 2003 three or four more proton therapy centers have opened in the United States.Some centres have since opened in Europe. (Germany, Switzerland and France).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massgeneral.org/cancer/about/providers/radiation/proton/principles.asp |title=Principles of Proton Beam Therapy |publisher=Massgeneral.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Christopher Owen - Pageservant |url=http://neurosurgery.mgh.harvard.edu/ProtonBeam/ |title=Proton Beam RadioTheraphy at Mass.

===Chromatin re-modeling agents===
This protocol is still in pre-clinical evaluation.  [[Histone deacetylase inhibitor|HDAC inhibitors]] are a new class of anticancer agents targeted directly at [[chromatin remodeling]]. These agents have been used in acute promyelocytic leukemia and have been found to affect the [[Histone deacetylase|HDAC]]-mediated transcriptional repression.  There is too little understanding of the INI1 deficiency to predict whether HDAC inhibitors will be effective against AT/RTs.  There are some laboratory results that indicate it is effective against certain AT/RT cell lines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhang ZK, Davies KP, Allen J, ''et al.'' |title=Cell cycle arrest and repression of cyclin D1 transcription by INI1/hSNF5 |journal=Mol.

==Prognosis==

The prognosis for AT/RT has been very poor, although there are some indications that an IRSIII-based therapy can produce long-term survival (60 to 72 months). Two-year survival is less than 20%, average survival postoperatively is 11 months, and doctors often recommend palliative care, especially with younger children because of the poor outcomes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Recently a protocol utilized by a multicenter trial reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology resulted in a 70% survival rate at 2–3 years, with most relapses occurring within months, leading to hope that there is a point beyond which patients can be considered cured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danafarberchildrens.org/news/new-hope-for-patients-with-rare-brain-tumors.html |title=New hope for patients with rare brain tumors |publisher=Danafarberchildrens.org |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref>

Patients with metastasis (disseminated tumor), larger tumors, tumors that could not be fully removed, or tumor recurrence, and who were younger than 36 months had the worst outcomes (i.e., shorter survival times).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

A retrospective survey from 36 AT/RT [[St. Jude Children's Hospital]] patients from 1984 to 2003 showed that the Two-year event-free survival (EFS) for children under three was 11%, the overall survival (OS) rate was 17%.  For children aged 3 years or older the EFS was 78% and the OS 89%.<ref name="jco.ascopubs.org"/> A retrospective register at the Cleveland Children's hospital on 42 AT/RT patients found median survival time is 16.25 months and a survival rate around 33%.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  One-quarter of these cases did not show the mutation in the [[SWI/SNF|INI1/hSNF5]] gene.

=== Metastasis ===
Metastatic spread is noted in approximately one-third of the AT/RT cases at the time of diagnosis and tumors can occur anywhere throughout the CNS.  The ASCO study of the 188 documented AT/RT cases prior to 2004 found 30% of the cases had metastasis at diagnosis.<ref name="Kieran" /> Metastatic spread to the [[meninges]] (leptomenigeal spread sometimes referred to as sugar coating) is common both initially and with relapse.  Average survival times decline with the presence of metastasis.  Primary CNS tumors generally metastasize only within the CNS.

One case of metastatic disease to the abdomen via ventriculoperitoneal [[shunt (medical)|shunt]] has been reported with AT/RT .  Metastatic dissemination via this mechanism has been reported with other brain tumors including [[germinoma]]s, [[medulloblastoma]]s, [[astrocytoma]]s, [[Glioma|glioblastomas]], [[ependymoma]]s and [[endodermal sinus tumor]]s.  Guler and Sugita separately reported cases of lung metastasis without a shunt.<ref>{{cite journal

==Epidemiology==

An estimated 3% of pediatric brain tumors are AT/RTs although this percentage may increase with better differentiation between PNET/medulloblastoma tumors and AT/RTs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

As with other CNS tumors, slightly more males are affected than females (ratio 1.6:1).  The ASCO study showed a 1.4:1 male to female ratio.<ref name="Kieran" />

==History==

Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor was first described as a distinct entity in 1987.<ref>

}}</ref><!-- cite 1987 description -->  Before 1978, when rhabdoid tumor was described, AT/RT likely was misdiagnosed as [[medulloblastoma]].   In some early reports the tumor was known also as ''' [[rhabdoid tumour|malignant rhabdoid tumor]]  (MRT) of the CNS'''.  Between 1978 and 1987, AT/RT was usually misdiagnosed as [[rhabdoid tumor]].  However, both AT/RT and non-CNS MRT have a worse prognosis than medulloblastoma and are resistant to the standard treatment protocols for medulloblastoma.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

By 1995, AT/RT had become regarded as a newly-defined aggressive, biologically unique class of primarily brain and spinal tumors, usually affecting infants and young children.<ref>{{cite journal

Twenty-two participants from 14 institutions came together to discuss the biology, treatments and new strategies for these tumors.  The consensus paper on the biology of the tumor was published in Clinical Research.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Biegel JA, Kalpana G, Knudsen ES, ''et al.'' |title=The role of INI1 and the SWI/SNF complex in the development of rhabdoid tumors: meeting summary from the workshop on childhood atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=323–8 |year=2002 |pmid=11782395 |doi= |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11782395}}</ref>
The workshop's recognition that CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) have deletions of the INI1 gene indicates that rhabdoid tumors of the kidney and brain are identical or closely related entities. This observation is not surprising because rhabdoid tumors at both locations possess similar histologic, clinical, and demographic features.

== Research directions ==
Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor is rare and no therapy has been proven to deliver long-term survival, nor is there a set of standard protocols.  Thus, most children with AT/RT are enrolled in [[clinical trial]]s to attempt to find an effective cure. A clinical trial is not a treatment standard;  it is research.  Some clinical trials compare an experimental treatment to a standard treatment, but only if such a standard treatment exists.

There is an ongoing research into stem cell transplant surgeries.
