'''Bronchial hyperresponsiveness''' (or other combinations with '''airway''' or '''hyperreactivity''') is a state characterised by easily triggered [[bronchospasm]] (contraction of the [[bronchioles]] or small airways).

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness can be assessed with a [[bronchial challenge test]]. This most often uses products like [[methacholine]] or [[histamine]]. These chemicals trigger bronchospasm in normal individuals as well, but people with bronchial hyperresponsiveness have a lower threshold.

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness is a hallmark of [[asthma]] but also occurs frequently in people suffering from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD).<ref name="pmid9817744">{{cite journal |author=Postma DS, Kerstjens HA |title=Characteristics of airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |journal=Am.
