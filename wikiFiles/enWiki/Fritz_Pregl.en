'''Fritz Pregl''' (in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] also Friderik Pregl) (3 September 1869 – 13 December 1930), was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]n [[chemist]] and [[physician]] from a mixed [[Slovene Language|Slovene]]-[[German Language|German]]-speaking background. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1923 for making important contributions to [[quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative]] [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[microanalysis]], one of which was the improvement of the [[combustion train]] technique for [[elemental analysis]].

==Biography==
Pregl was born in [[Ljubljana]] within [[Austria-Hungary]] to a Slovene-speaking father and German-speaking mother. He died in [[Graz]], [[Austria]] in 1930.

Pregl started his career as [[chemist]] after he studied medicine at the [[University of Graz]]. With his focus on [[physiology]] and especially chemical physiology, he suffered from the limitations of [[quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative]] [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[microanalysis]]. The small quantities of substances he obtained during the research of [[bile acid]] made it necessary to improve the process of [[elemental analysis]] by reducing the necessary components. At the end of his research, he had lowered the minimal amount of substance necessary for the analysis process by a factor of 50. He invited chemists to learn his method of elemental analysis, so that the method was soon widely accepted.

==Commemoration==
In 1950, the department of the [[University of Graz]] where Fritz Pregl had worked was named the [[Institute of Medical Chemistry and Pregl Laboratory]]. Streets in Graz, Innsbruck, Vienna and Klagenfurt were named after him. In Slovenia, [[Pregl Award]]s have been bestowed annually since 2007 by the [[National Institute of Chemistry (Slovenia)|National Institute of Chemistry]] for the research work and for outstanding [[doctorate]]s. Slovenian pupils are conferred Pregl Recognition Awards, whereas secondary school students are conferred Pregl Citations for excellent results in national competitions in chemistry. A square in Ljubljana is named after Pregl.<ref>{{cite article |url=http://www.koz.si/megakviz/Data/pregl.pdf |title=Friderik Pregl |journal=Slovenski knjižnično-muzejski megakviz |volume=10/11 |first=Ivanka |last=Učakar |coauthors=Žiga Rangus |publisher=Ljubljana City Library |year=2011 |month=January |language=Slovene}}</ref>
