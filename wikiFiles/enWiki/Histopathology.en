'''Histopathology''' (compound of three [[Greek language|Greek]] word's: ''{{lang|grc|ἱστός}}'' histos "tissue", ''πάθος'' pathos "disease-suffering", and -''λογία'' [[-logy|-logia]]) refers to the [[light microscope|microscopic]] examination of tissue in order to study the manifestations of [[disease]]. Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology refers to the examination of a [[biopsy]] or surgical [[Laboratory specimen|specimen]] by a [[pathology|pathologist]], after the specimen has been processed and [[histological section]]s have been placed onto glass slides. In contrast, [[cytopathology]] examines free cells or tissue fragments.

== Collection of tissues ==
Histopathological examination of tissues starts with [[surgery]], [[biopsy]], or [[autopsy]]. The tissue is removed from the [[body]] or [[plant]], and then placed in a [[fixation (histology)|fixative]] which stabilizes the tissues to prevent [[Decomposition|decay]]. The most common fixative is [[formalin]] (10% [[formaldehyde]] in water).

== Preparation for histology ==
{{Main|Histology}}
The tissue is then prepared for viewing under a [[microscope]] using either chemical fixation or frozen section.

=== Chemical fixation ===
In baths of xylene

=== Frozen section processing ===
The second method of histology processing is called [[frozen section]] processing. In this method, the tissue is frozen and sliced thinly using a [[microtome]] mounted in a below-freezing refrigeration device called the [[cryostat]].  The thin frozen sections are mounted on a glass slide, fixed immediately & briefly in liquid fixative, and stained using the similar staining techniques as traditional wax embedded sections.  The advantages of this method is rapid processing time, less equipment requirement, and less need for ventilation in the laboratory.  The disadvantage is the poor quality of the final slide.  It is used in intra-operative pathology for determinations that might help in choosing the next step in surgery during that surgical session (for example, to preliminarily determine clearness of the [[resection margin]] of a tumor during surgery).

== Staining of the Processed Histology Slides ==

This can be done to slides processed by the chemical fixation or frozen section slides.  To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more [[pigments]]. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast.

The most commonly used stain in histopathology is a combination of [[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] (often abbreviated H&E). Hematoxylin is used to stain [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] '''blue''', while eosin stains [[cytoplasm]] and the extracellular connective tissue matrix '''pink'''. There are hundreds of various other techniques which have been used to selectively stain cells. Other compounds used to color tissue sections include [[safranin]], [[Oil Red O]], [[congo red]], [[Silver compounds|silver salts]] and artificial dyes. '''Histochemistry''' refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. A commonly performed histochemical technique is the [[Perls' Prussian blue]] reaction, used to demonstrate iron deposits in diseases like [[Hemochromatosis]].<ref>http://www.scribd.com/doc/4448747/Perl Perls' Prussian blue original formula and uses.

Recently, [[antibody|antibodies]] have been used to stain particular [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s. Called [[immunohistochemistry]], this technique has greatly increased the ability to specifically identify categories of cells under a microscope. Other advanced techniques include '''in situ hybridization''' to identify specific [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] molecules.  These antibody staining methods often require the use of frozen section histology.
Digital cameras are increasingly used to capture histopathological images.

== Interpretation ==
The histological slides are examined under a microscope by a [[pathology|pathologist]], a medically qualified specialist who has completed a recognised training programme (5 - 5.5 years in the United Kingdom). This [[medical diagnosis]] is formulated as a '''pathology report''' describing the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. In the case of [[cancer]], this represents the '''tissue diagnosis''' required for most treatment protocols.  In the removal of [[cancer]], the pathologist will indicate whether the [[surgical margin]] is cleared, or is involved (residual cancer is left behind).  This is done using either the [[bread loafing]] or [[CCPDMA]] method of processing.

== In myocardial infarction ==
{{Further|Timeline of myocardial infarction pathology}}
After a [[myocardial infarction]], no histopathology is seen the first ~30 minutes. The only possible sign the first 4 hours is waviness of fibres at border. Later, however, a [[coagulation necrosis]] is initiated, with edema and hemorrhage. After 12 hours, there can be seen [[karyopyknosis]] and hypereosinophilia of myocytes with contraction band necrosis in margins, as well as beginning of neutrophil infiltration. At 1 – 3 days there is continued coagulation necrosis with loss of nuclei and striations and an increased infiltration of neutrophils to interstitium. Until the end of the first week after infarction there is beginning of disintegration of dead muscle fibres, necrosis of neutrophils and beginning of macrophage removal of dead cells at border, which increases the succeeding days. After a week there is also beginning of granulation tissue formation at margins, which matures during the following month, and gets increased collagen deposition and decreased cellularity until the [[myocardial scarring]] is fully mature at approximately 2 months after infarction.<ref name=Kumar11>Chapter 11 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref>
