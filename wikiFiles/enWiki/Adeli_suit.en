[[File:ADELI suit.jpg|thumbnail]]
The '''ADELI Suit''' was originally designed for the [[Russia]]n [[Soviet space program|space program]] in 1971.{{cn|date=December 2012}} The purpose then was to give the [[Astronaut|cosmonauts]] in [[space]] a way to counter the effects of long-term [[weightlessness]] on the body. It is currently used to treat children with physical disabilities resulting from [[cerebral palsy]], other [[Neurology|neurological]] conditions originating from brain damage or [[spinal cord injury]].{{cn|date=December 2012}}<!-- This citation must show that treatment is effective. --> <!-- The therapy in the suit has been proposed as an alternative to the conventional therapy to treat the impairments associated with cerebral palsy as well as other neuromuscular disorders originating from the brain damage. Reference: http://cogprints.org/7257/1/2010-4-14.pdf -->

==Construction==

<!-- What is the origin of the acronym (or name?) "ADELI"? This is a question that this article really should answer! -->
<!-- There is no explanation on the origin of the acronym "ADELI". However, this could be potentially added to the article: The Adeli Suit is a modification of a space suit, called the “Penguin” suit, which was then modified resulting in an elasticized suit for use in positioning and stretching muscles during physical therapy. Reference: http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/600_699/0696.html  -->
The suit is designed to create a normal framework of forces on the body, stabilizing the torso to allow more fluent and coordinated movement for all the limbs. The suit uses a system of elastic bands and pulleys that create artificial forces against which the body can work, to prevent [[Muscle atrophy|muscular atrophy]] and reduce [[osteoporosis]].{{cn|date=December 2012}} It consists of a vest, shorts, knee pads, shoes and sometimes a head piece, all connected in a prescribed pattern with [[Bungee cord|bungees]] of appropriate tension. The theory behind the ADELI Suit is that through active movement [[therapy]] the brain is stimulated and thus retrained to recognize, and eventually initiate, correct movement of the muscles. <ref name="adeli-method">{{cite web|url=http://adeli-center.com/en/?page_id=2256 |title=Space Neurology &#124; ADELI Medical Center |publisher=Adeli-center.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-02}}</ref>

==Claimed benefits==

The ADELI Medical Center states that the effect of the suit is that the established pathological [[Synapse|synaptic]] pathways are rewritten with the new normal [[reflex]] pathways, which exercises [[therapeutic]] effects on the structures of the [[Central Nervous System]] responsible for motor activity.<ref name="adeli-method" /> Claimed benefits include external stabilization, restoration of muscle tone, re-alignment of the body towards the normal, normalization of gait, provision of tactile stimulation, improved balance, support of weakened muscles, strengthening of functional muscles, relaxation of contracted muscles, and improvement of coordination.<ref name="adeli-method" /><ref>{{Cite journal

Not all patients are suitable for the ADELI Suit treatment.<!-- more detail needed --> <!-- Please,let's rephrase this sentence into something like this: Suit therapy has been proposed as a treatment for cerebral palsy, however, the suit manufacturers also recommend the treatment for other neuromuscular disorders, including developmental delays, traumatic brain injury, post-stroke, ataxia, athetosis, spasticity and hypotonia. The suit is, however, contraindicated in patients with hip subluxation greater than 50% or severe scoliosis and used with precautions in patients with heart conditions uncontrolled seizure activities, hip subluxation, hydrocephalus, diabetes, kidney problems and hypertension.

==Long-term effects==

Rehabilitative gains in motor control through treatment with the ADELI Suit are typically retained after the intensive course is completed.{{cn|date=December 2012}} Research on groups of children with the ADELI Suit therapy has shown long-term retention of skills once their therapy program ceased.{{cn|date=December 2012}} However, further research is still needed into all the long-term effects.
