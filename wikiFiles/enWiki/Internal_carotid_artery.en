In [[human anatomy]], the '''internal carotid arteries''' are two major [[arteries]], one on each side of the head and neck.  They arise from the [[common carotid arteries]] where these bifurcate into the internal and [[external carotid artery]]; the internal carotid artery supplies the brain, while the external carotid nourishes other portions of the head, such as face, scalp, skull, and meninges.

==Classification==
[[Terminologia Anatomica]] in 1998 subdivided the artery into four parts: "cervical", "petrous", "cavernous", and "cerebral".<ref>{{LoyolaMedEd|Neuro/neurovasc/navigation/ica.htm}}</ref><ref> {{DorlandsDict|one/000008499|Internal carotid artery}}</ref> However, in clinical settings, the classification system of the internal carotid artery usually follows the 1996 recommendations by Bouthillier,<ref name="Bouthillier et al. 1996">{{cite journal |last=Bouthillier |first=Alain |coauthors=Harry van Loveren, Jefferey Keller  |year=1996 |month=March |title=Segments of the internal carotid artery: a new classification |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=425â€“432 |pmid=8837792 |doi=10.1097/00006123-199603000-00001 }}</ref> describing seven anatomical segments of the internal carotid artery, each with a corresponding alphanumberic identifier -- C1 cervical, C2 petrous, C3 lacerum, C4 cavernous, C5 clinoid, C6 ophthalmic, and C7 communicating. The Bouthillier nomenclature remains in widespread use by neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and neurologists. The segments are subdivided based on anatomical and microsurgical landmarks and surrounding anatomy, more than [[angiographic]] appearance of the artery.  An alternative [[embryologic]] classification system proposed by [[:fr:Pierre Lasjaunias|Pierre Lasjaunias]] and colleagues is invaluable when it comes to explanation of many internal carotid artery variants. An older clinical classification, based on pioneering work by Fischer in 1938, is mainly of historical significance.

[[File:Circle of Willis 5.jpg|thumb|300px|Internal carotid artery]]
The segments of the internal carotid artery are as follows:

* '''Cervical segment''', or C1, identical to the commonly used [[Cervical part of internal carotid artery|Cervical portion]]
* '''Petrous segment''', or C2
* '''Lacerum segment''', or C3
**C2 and C3 compose the commonly termed [[Petrous portion of the internal carotid artery|Petrous portion]]
* '''Cavernous segment''', or C4, almost identical to the commonly used [[Cavernous part of internal carotid artery|Cavernous portion]]
* '''Clinoid segment''', or C5. This segment is not identified in some earlier classifications, and lies between the commonly used [[Cavernous part of internal carotid artery|Cavernous portion]] and  [[Cerebral portion of internal carotid artery|Cerebral or Supraclinoid portion]]

* '''Ophthalmic''', or supraclinoid segment, or C6
* '''Communicating''', or terminal segment, or C7
** C6 and C7 together constitute the commonly used [[Cerebral portion of internal carotid artery|Cerebral or Supraclinoid portion]]

[[Image:Magnetic resonance angiogram of segments of the internal carotid artery.jpg|thumb|Segments of the internal carotid artery, delineated on an [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MRA]] of the head.]]
The internal carotid artery is a terminal branch of the [[common carotid artery]]; it arises around the level of the third cervical [[vertebra]] when the common carotid bifurcates into this artery and its more superficial counterpart, the [[external carotid artery]].  

===C1: Cervical segment===
[[Image:Gray384.png|thumb|Level of 6th cervical vertebrae -- still at level of common carotid, but relationships are similar to those of cervical segment of internal carotid.]]
The '''cervical segment''', or C1, of the internal carotid extends from the carotid bifurcation until it enters the [[carotid canal]] in the skull anterior to the jugular foramen. 
[[File:Internal carotid artery.jpg|thumb|Internal carotid artery - dissection]]
At its origin, the internal carotid artery is somewhat dilated.  This part of the artery is known as the [[carotid sinus]] or the carotid bulb.  The ascending portion of the cervical segment occurs distal to the bulb, when the vessel walls are again parallel.

The internal carotid runs vertically upward in the [[carotid sheath]], and enters the [[Human skull|skull]] through the [[carotid canal]]. During this part of its course, it lies in front of the transverse processes of the upper three cervical vertebrae. 

It is relatively superficial at its start, where it is contained in the [[carotid triangle]] of the neck, and lies behind and lateral to the external carotid, overlapped by the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and covered by the deep fascia, the [[platysma]], and integument: it then passes beneath the [[parotid gland]], being crossed by the [[hypoglossal nerve]], the [[digastric muscle]] and the [[stylohyoid muscle]], the [[occipital artery]] and the [[posterior auricular artery]]. Higher up, it is separated from the external carotid by the [[styloglossus]] and [[stylopharyngeus]] muscles, the tip of the styloid process and the [[stylohyoid ligament]], the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] and the pharyngeal branch of the [[vagus nerve]]. It is in relation, behind, with the [[longus capitis]], the [[superior cervical ganglion]] of the [[sympathetic trunk]], and the [[superior laryngeal nerve]]; laterally, with the [[internal jugular vein]] and vagus nerve, the nerve lying on a plane posterior to the artery; medially, with the [[pharynx]], superior laryngeal nerve, and [[ascending pharyngeal artery]]. At the base of the skull the glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, and hypoglossal nerves lie between the artery and the internal jugular vein.

Unlike the [[external carotid artery]], the internal carotid normally has no branches in the [[neck]].

===C2: Petrous segment===
The '''petrous segment''', or C2, of the internal carotid is that which is inside the petrous part of the [[temporal bone]]. This segment extends until the [[foramen lacerum]]. The petrous portion classically has three sections: an ascending, or vertical portion; the genu, or bend; and the horizontal portion.
   
When the internal carotid artery enters the canal in the [[petrous portion of the temporal bone]], it first ascends a short distance, then curves anteriorly and medially. The artery lies at first in front of the [[cochlea]] and [[tympanic cavity]]; from the latter cavity it is separated by a thin, bony lamella, which is cribriform in the young subject, and often partly absorbed in old age. Farther forward it is separated from the [[trigeminal ganglion]] by a thin plate of bone, which forms the floor of the fossa for the ganglion and the roof of the horizontal portion of the canal. Frequently this bony plate is more or less deficient, and then the ganglion is separated from the artery by fibrous membrane. The artery is separated from the bony wall of the [[carotid canal]] by a prolongation of [[dura mater]], and is surrounded by a number of small veins and by filaments of the [[carotid plexus]], derived from the ascending branch of the [[superior cervical ganglion]] of the sympathetic trunk. 

The named branches of the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery are:
*the [[vidian artery]] or artery of the pterygoid canal
*the [[caroticotympanic artery]]

===C3: Lacerum segment===
The '''lacerum segment''', or C3, is a short segment that begins above the [[foramen lacerum]] and ends at the [[petrolingual ligament]], a reflection of [[periosteum]]  between the lingula and petrous apex (or petrosal process) of the [[sphenoid bone]]. The lacerum portion is still considered 'extra-dural', as it is surrounded by periosteum and fibrocartilage along its course. The vidian artery arises from the lacerum segment, though it is often too small to be angioraphically visible. It is erroneously stated in several anatomy text books that the internal carotid artery passes through the foramen lacerum. This at best has only ever been a partial truth in that it passes through the superior part of the foramen on its way to the cavernous sinus. As such it does not traverse the skull through it. The inferior part of the foramen is actually filled with fibrocartilage. The broad consensus is that the internal carotid artery should not be described as travelling through the foramen lacerum. <ref>TAUBER M, VAN LOVEREN H. R et al. The enigmatic foramen lacerum. Commentaries. Neurosurgery. 1999, vol. 44, no2, pp. 386-393 [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=1668325]</ref>

===C4: Cavernous segment===
[[Image:Gray571.png|thumb|Oblique section through the cavernous sinus.]]
The '''cavernous segment''', or C4, of the internal carotid artery begins at the petrolingual ligament and extends to the proximal dural ring, which is formed by the medial and inferior periosteum of the anterior clinoid process. The cavernous segment is surrounded by the [[cavernous sinus]].

In this part of its course, the artery is situated between the layers of the dura mater forming the cavernous sinus, but covered by the lining membrane of the sinus. It at first ascends toward the [[posterior clinoid process]], then passes forward by the side of the [[body of the sphenoid bone]], and again curves upward on the medial side of the [[anterior clinoid process]], and perforates the dura mater forming the roof of the sinus. The curve in the cavernous segment is called the carotid siphon. This portion of the artery is surrounded by filaments of the sympathetic trunk, and on its lateral side is the [[abducent nerve]], or cranial nerve VI.

The named branches of the cavernous segment are:
* the [[meningohypophyseal artery]]
* the [[inferolateral trunk]]

The cavernous segment also gives rise to small capsular arteries that supply the wall of the cavernous sinus.

===C5: Clinoid segment===
The '''clinoid segment''', or C5, is another short segment of the internal carotid that begins after the artery exits the [[cavernous sinus]] at the proximal dural ring and extends distally to the distal dural ring, after which the carotid artery is considered 'intra-dural' and has entered the [[subarachnoid space]]. 

The clinoid segment normally has no named branches, though the [[ophthalmic artery]] may arise from the clinoid segment.

===C6: Ophthalmic segment===
[[Image:Gray514.png|thumb|The ophthalmic artery and its branches.]]
The '''ophthalmic segment''', or C6, extends from the distal dural ring, which is continuous with the falciform ligament, to the origin of the [[posterior communicating artery]].  The ophthalmic segment courses roughly horizontally, parallel to the [[optic nerve]] which runs superomedially to the carotid at this point. 

The named branches of the ophthalmic segment are:
*the [[ophthalmic artery]]
*the [[superior hypophyseal artery]]

===C7: Communicating segment===
The '''communicating segment''', or terminal segment, or C7, of the internal carotid artery passes between the optic and oculomotor nerves to the anterior perforated substance at the medial extremity of the lateral cerebral fissure. Angiographically, this segment extends from the origin of the [[posterior communicating artery]] to the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery.  

The named branches of the communicating segment are:
*the [[posterior communicating artery]]
*the [[anterior choroidal artery]]

The internal carotid then divides to form the [[anterior cerebral artery]] and [[middle cerebral artery]]. The internal carotid artery can receive blood flow via an important [[anastomosis|collateral pathway]] supplying the brain, the cerebral arterial circle, which is more commonly known as the [[Circle of Willis]].
