The administration of drugs to whole populations irrespective of disease status is referred to as '''mass drug administration (MDA)'''. This article describes the administration of [[antimalarial drugs]] to whole populations an intervention which has been used as a [[malaria]]-control measure for more than 70 years. Recent proposals to eliminate or even to eradicate [[malaria]] have led to a renewed interest in mass drug administrations in areas with very high malaria [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemicity]].<ref>Brian Greenwood The use of anti-malarial drugs to prevent malaria in the population of malaria endemic areas; ''Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg.'' '''70(1)''', pp1&ndash;7</ref> Drugs have been administered either directly as a full therapeutic course of treatment or indirectly through the fortification of salt. Mass drug administrations were generally unsuccessful in interrupting transmission but, in some cases, had a marked effect on [[parasite]] prevalence and on the incidence of clinical malaria. MDAs are likely to encourage the spread of drug-resistant parasites and so have only a limited role in malaria control. They may have a part to play in the management of epidemics and in the control of malaria in areas with a very short transmission season. In order to reduce the risk of spreading drug resistance, MDAs should use more than one drug and, preferably include a drug, such as an [[artemisinin]], which has an effect on [[gametocytes]]. MDAs have low acceptance in areas with low malaria endemicity.

==Background and history==
Reports of attempts to control malaria through mass treatment with antimalarial drugs date back to at least 1932.<ref name="Barber1932">Barber, M. et al. (1932) Malaria studies on the Firestone rubber plantation in Liberia, West Africa. Am J Hyg 15 (3), 601n = 1 fallacy633</ref> In the 1950s, the WHO included mass drug administration (MDA) of antimalarial drugs as a tool for malaria eradication ‘in exceptional conditions when conventional control techniques have failed.<ref>WHO.

Considering the short lasing benefit of mass drug administration one modification has been to repeat mass drug administrations which has led to the development of [[intermittent preventive therapy]].

==Methods==
Two methods of MDA, direct and indirect, have been used. In direct MDA, also referred to as ‘Mass drug treatment’, a therapeutic dose of the antimalarial drug, usually in the form of tablets, is given to an entire population. In indirect MDA, the antimalarial drug is added to food stuff, usually salt.

===Direct drug administration===
The first, well documented use of direct MDA took place in a rubber plantation in [[Liberia]] in 1931.<ref name="Barber1932"/> Two doses of the 8-[[aminoquinoline]] [[plasmoquine]] were given weekly to workers and their families in two camps. The [[prevalence]]s of malaria parasite infections in humans and anopheline mosquitoes before and after treatment were studied. The authors concluded that ‘the fall in the [[mosquito]] infection rate of the two plasmoquine treated camps was so large as to indicate a local disappearance, or at least a great reduction, in [[gametocyte]] carriers in the treated population’. No long-term follow up data were provided for this study or most of the trials reported subsequently. The next documented use of MDA in sub-Saharan Africa took place in 1948 and 1949 in tea estates in Kericho, [[Kenya]].<ref name="pmid15414786">{{cite journal |author=Dixon DS |title=Paludrine (proguanil) as a malarial prophylactic amongst African labour in Kenya |journal=East Afr Med J |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=127–30 |year=1950 |month=March |pmid=15414786 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Ten thousand inhabitants of the tea estates received twice weekly proguanil from April to July 1948. The intervention was supplemented with DDT spraying in March and June of the following year. Before the intervention the mean malaria incidence in July, the peak of the malaria transmission season, was 56 cases per 1000 population. Following the intervention 4 malaria cases were detected in July 1949. The author therefore recommended continuation of twice weekly [[proguanil]] prophylaxis on the estates.
 
The Nandi district of Kenya was the scene of a large MDA in 1953 and 1954.<ref name="pmid13473734">{{cite journal |author=Matson AT |title=The history of malaria in Nandi |journal=East Afr Med J |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=431–41 |year=1957 |month=August |pmid=13473734 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid14179766">{{cite journal |author=Roberts JM |title=The control of epidemic malaria in the highlands of Western Kenya.

The coverage was estimated to be around 95%.  Before the intervention severe malaria [[epidemic]]s had been reported in the area. Following the intervention the parasite prevalence dropped from 23% to 2.3%.  The author states that in a control area parasite prevalence rose over the same period  to over 50%. It was felt that the MDA was effective in curbing severe malaria epidemics. In the following three years, 1955 to 1957, [[pyrimethamine]] administration was replaced with [[Dieldrin]] spraying to consolidate malaria control, which makes an assessment of the long term effect of this MDA impossible. 

During a pilot programme in [[Uganda]] in 1959 mass administration of [[chloroquine]] / [[pyrimethamine]] was combined with spraying of residual insecticides ([[DDT]]).<ref name="pmid13720940">{{cite journal |author=De Zulueta J, Kafuko GW, Cullen JR, Pedersen CK |title=The results of the first year of a malaria eradication pilot project in Northern Kigezi (Uganda) |journal=East Afr Med J |volume=38 |issue= |pages=1–26 |year=1961 |month=January |pmid=13720940 |doi= |url=}}</ref> The success of the pilot programme led to a larger study targeted at a population of 16,000.

Two large trials of MDA combined with household spraying with [[DDT]] were conducted in [[Cameroun]] and Upper Volta ([[Burkina Faso]]) in 1960&ndash;1961.<ref name="pmid13890755">{{cite journal |author=Escudie A, Hamon J, Ricosse JH, Chartol A |title=[Results of 2 years of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis in the rural African area in the pilot zone of Bobo Dioulasso (Haute Volta).] |language=French |journal=Med Trop (Mars) |volume=21(Special) |issue= |pages=689–728 |year=1961 |pmid=13890755 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>Escudie, A. et al.

After the MDA, the parasite prevalence in children decreased, but the overall parasite prevalence increased slightly, thus failing to deplete the [[reservoir]] of infection.<ref name="pmid4434871">{{cite journal |author=Dola SK |title=Mass drug administration as a supplementary attack measure in malaria eradication programme |journal=East Afr Med J |volume=51 |issue=7 |pages=529–31 |year=1974 |month=July |pmid=4434871 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Two trials in Northern [[Nigeria]] combined multiple rounds of MDA and [[insecticide]] spraying. The first trial, in Kankiya, included 11 rounds of MDA combined with 8 rounds of [[DDT]] indoor spraying.<ref>Najera, J.A. et al. (1973) Mass drug administration and DDT indoor-spraying as antimalarial measures in the Northern savanna of Nigeria, WHO/MAL/73.817 (WHO/MAL/73.817) WHO</ref> The study was based on computer-aided models that showed that MDA could eradicate malaria in the study area if combined with an appropriate ‘insecticide attack’.<ref>Macdonald, G. et al. (1967) The potential value of mass treatment in malaria eradication (WHO/MAL/67.615) WHO</ref> Following MDAs, parasite prevalence dropped from 19% to&nbsp;1%. The investigators did not consider this a success because parasite prevalence increased again after the interventions were stopped. Entomological indices also showed only a temporary reduction in transmission, which was completely reversed after the control measures ceased. Because the investigators felt that the failure of the trial to interrupt transmission was due to operational inadequacies, they recommended a much larger and more sophisticated evaluation of [[insecticide]] spraying combined with MDA. This recommendation helped to launch the Garki project, also in Northern Nigeria, in 1969.<ref>Molineaux, L. and Gramiccia, G. (1980) The Garki Project. Research on the Epidemiology and Control of Malaria in the Sudan Savanna of West Africa., WHO</ref> In the [[Garki, Nigeria|Garki]] project, all 164 study villages in the catchment area were sprayed with [[propoxur]], a residual insecticide. In addition, in 60 villages, MDA with [[sulfalene]]/[[pyrimethamine]] was given at 10 week intervals for two years. In two small village clusters, house spraying was supplemented with [[larvicide]] and MDA every two weeks. With biweekly MDA, parasite prevalence fell to&nbsp;1% in the dry season and to&nbsp;5% in the rainy season. MDA given every 10 weeks resulted in a parasite prevalence of 2% in the dry season and 28% in the rainy season. Transmission was not interrupted with either MDA regime. The authors concluded that spraying of residual insecticides and MDA did not result in a sustainable interruption of malaria transmission. 

In 1999 in [[The Gambia]] residents living in 33 of 42 villages in the catchment area received a single dose of [[sulfadoxine]]/ [[pyrimethamine]] (SP) combined with artesunate while the residents of nine control villages received placebo.<ref name="pmid14584381">{{cite journal |author=von Seidlein L, Walraven G, Milligan PJ, ''et al.'' |title=The effect of mass administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combined with artesunate on malaria incidence: a double-blind, community-randomized, placebo-controlled trial in The Gambia |journal=Trans.

Initially, during July and August, the mean malaria incidence rate in treated villages was significantly lower than in the control villages. In subsequent months, the incidence was slightly higher in the MDA villages. The difference between the two groups was '''not''' statistically significant. Overall no benefit of the mass drug administration was detected over the course of the malaria transmission season.

A mass drug administration campaign using S/P, [[artesunate]] and [[primaquine]] was completed in Moshi district, [[Tanzania]] in 2008. The findings have yet to be published.

Outside of sub-Saharan Africa one of the larger reported malaria-control projects using MDA took place in Nicaragua in 1981 following the overthrow of the [[Somoza]] regime.<ref name="pmid6136655">{{cite journal |author=Garfield RM, Vermund SH |title=Changes in malaria incidence after mass drug administration in Nicaragua |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8348 |pages=500–3 |year=1983 |month=August |pmid=6136655 |doi= |url=}}</ref> An estimated 70% of Nicaragua’s total population (1.9 million people) received [[chloroquine]] and [[primaquine]] during the peak period of disease transmission (November). An estimated 9200 cases of malaria were prevented. The campaign had better results in preventing and curing malaria infections than in interrupting transmission. However, the mass administration of antimalarials was not sustainable and, as with other malaria-control efforts, collapsed following the return of politically conservative forces.<ref name="pmid10437886">{{cite journal |author=Garfield R |title=Malaria control in Nicaragua: social and political influences on disease transmission and control activities |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9176 |pages=414–8 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10437886 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)02226-6 |url=}}</ref>

In three malaria-control projects conducted in the Indian states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and [[Orissa]] in the early 1960s, MDA had an ancillary role and was mentioned only briefly in reports on these interventions.<ref>Lakshmanacharyulu, T. et al.

The incidence of malaria decreased so that, by the end of 1979, the authors considered the intervention to be a success.

In 1984, MDA was added to the distribution of [[insecticide-impregnated bed]] nets ([[ITN]]s) in [[Sabah]] ([[Malaysia]]), but this failed to interrupt malaria transmission.<ref name="pmid2979556">{{cite journal |author=Hii JL, Vun YS, Chin KF, ''et al.'' |title=The influence of permethrin-impregnated bednets and mass drug administration on the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in Sabah, Malaysia |journal=Med.

An additional 300&nbsp;mg [[chloroquine]] and 75&nbsp;mg [[pyrimethamine]] plus 1500&nbsp;mg [[sulfadoxine]] was added to this regimen in the first, fifth, and ninth week. Children received an adjusted equivalent of the adult dose. Follow-up consisted of yearly parasite surveillance. During the seven surveillance years following the MDA, no ''P.falciparum'' infections were detected.

MDA is included in the malaria-control policy of the People’s Republic of [[China]]. Following the first malaria-control phase from 1955 to 1962, which was mostly focused on malaria surveys, mass administrations were added to vector control measures and improved case management in 10 of China’s 33 provinces.<ref name="pmid9653729">{{cite journal |author=Yip K |title=Antimalarial work in China: a historical perspective |journal=Parassitologia |volume=40 |issue=1-2 |pages=29–38 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9653729 |doi= |url=}}</ref> The drugs used in the administrations, mostly chloroquine and piperaquine, were provided free of charge by the central government. The economic reforms instituted by [[Deng Xiaoping]], which ultimately put an end to the provision of free health care through the central government and the emergence of resistance against the most widely used antimalarials modified the use of mass drug administrations after 1980. MDAs are now targeted at high-risk populations, specifically non-immune migratory workers who receive repeated courses during the high transmission season. According to government guidelines, [[piperaquine]], [[chloroquine]], or [[sulfadoxine]] combined with [[primaquine]] can be used for mass administrations.<ref>Ministry-of-Health.

Malaria burden and control measures are shown in Table 1. Between 1990 and 2000 the malaria prevalence dropped from 10.6 to 1.9 / 100,000, the number of reported malaria cases dropped from 117,359 to 24,088 while the number of reported deaths attributable to malaria remained stable.<ref name="pmid14519583">{{cite journal |author=von Seidlein L, Greenwood BM |title=Mass administrations of antimalarial drugs |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=452–60 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14519583 |doi= 10.1016/j.pt.2003.08.003|url=}}</ref> These data, reported to the national government, depend on reporting from health care providers and like all data depending on passive surveillance tend to underestimate the true disease burden. However there is no reason to think that the level of underreporting has changed over the last decade. Therefore the proportional reduction in malaria disease burden is likely to be true. Malaria-control measures, including MDA, as well as major ecologic changes during the second half of the last century are likely to have been responsible for the more than 100-fold reduction in malaria burden in China since the initial surveys in 1955.<ref name="pmid11775219">{{cite journal |author=Tang L |title=Progress in malaria control in China |journal=Chin.

===Indirect MDA===
A different approach to MDA consists of adding an antimalarial to an essential foodstuff, usually salt. Chloroquinized salt for malaria suppression was introduced by Pinotti in 1952 and gave promising results in a number of field trials and malaria-control programmes in Brazil.<ref name="pmid13089160">{{cite journal |author=Pinotti M |title=[New method for the control of malaria by the use of drugs mixed with kitchen salt in daily diet.] |language=Portuguese |journal=Rev Bras Med |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=241–6 |year=1953 |month=April |pmid=13089160 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid13186255">{{cite journal |author=Pinotti M |title=[New method of malaria prevention: combination of an antimalarial drug with table salt used daily in food.] |language=Portuguese |journal=Rev Bras Malariol Doencas Trop |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=5–12 |year=1954 |month=January |pmid=13186255 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid18831147">{{cite journal |author=Hochman G |title=From autonomy to partial alignment: national malaria programs in the time of global eradication, Brazil, 1941&ndash;1961 |journal=Can Bull Med Hist |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=161–92 |year=2008 |pmid=18831147 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

In 1959, the WHO conducted a trial in West New Guinea (later known as [[Irian Jaya]]).<ref name="pmid14208125">{{cite journal |author=Meuwissen JH |title=The use of medicated salt in an antimalaria campaign in West New Guinea |journal=Trop Geogr Med |volume=16 |issue= |pages=245–55 |year=1964 |month=September |pmid=14208125 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Salt crystals were mixed with pyrimethamine so as to provide a 0.07% pyrimethamine salt. As there were no shops in the catchment area, each family unit received fortnightly a quantity of salt from the local teacher or another member of the village community. Within three and a half months of the onset of the campaign, clinically significant levels of [[pyrimethamine]] resistance were reported. It was then decided to mix the remaining stock of pyrimethaminized salt with [[chloroquine]] powder. The chloroquine base content was 0.04% or 140&nbsp;mg per adult per week based on a 5g per day salt consumption. The emergence of [[chloroquine resistance]] was investigated, but this was not detected. The distribution of medicated salts otherwise had no effect and it was concluded that ''‘Pinotti’s method holds no prospect of malaria eradication…’''. The explanation for this finding given by the author is that ''‘the salt consumption by children was too small to reduce significantly the parasite reservoir of the younger age groups’''.

Between 1961 and 1965, the use of chloroquinized salt was made compulsory over an area of 109,000km2 in [[Guyana]], covering a population of 48,500 individuals.<ref>Giglioli, G. (1967) Interruption of malaria transmission by chloroquinized salt in Guyana, with observations on a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Bull. WHO 36 (2), 283&ndash;301.</ref> The chloroquinized salt was prepared at a state salt plant so as to provide a 0.43% [[chloroquine]] concentration. The salt was sold in two pound plastic bags. The state held the monopoly for the salt. The only alternative source was salt smuggled from Brazil. Although the chloroquinized salt was used, its popularity was limited by the occurrence of a photo-allergic [[dermatitis]] popularly called ‘salt itch’ noted in all treatment areas. [[Chloroquine resistance]] was first observed in 1962 in the area with the lowest relative uptake of chloroquinized salt. In the course of the following months, a complete replacement of the susceptible strains with resistant ''P. falciparum'' strains was observed. Following the reintroduction of [[DDT]] spraying, the prevalence of ''P. falciparum'' declined.

In Southeast Asia, the medicated salt project at [[Pailin]], on the [[Kampuchea]]-[[Thailand|Thai]] border, demonstrated how drug resistance can develop when a large population of ''P. falciparum'' undergoing high transmission rates is exposed to intense drug pressure.<ref name="pmid3526576">{{cite journal |author=Verdrager J |title=Epidemiology of emergence and spread of drug-resistant falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia |journal=Southeast Asian J.

Sea salt was mixed with [[pyrimethamine]] at a concentration of 0.05%. Between 1960 and 1961, 77 tons of medicated salt were distributed in the area. After widespread [[pyrimethamine resistance]] was reported, pyrimethamine was replaced by [[chloroquine]]. From 1961 to 1962, 75 tons of chloroquine were distributed.  In two indicator districts, the parasite rates decreased from 40% to 7% and from 27% to 14%.<ref name="pmid14072437">{{cite journal |author=Eyles DE, Hoo CC, Warren M, Sandosham AA |title=Plasmodium falciparum resistant to chloroquine in Cambodia |journal=Am.

==Assessing effectiveness==
Whether MDAs can be considered successful or not depends on the expectation of what they might achieve; many studies do not define whether their main aim was to interrupt transmission or to control disease. When MDAs were used as part of an attempt to interrupt transmission completely, they almost always failed. Only one project, conducted on [[Aneityum]], a small isolated island in the Pacific, succeeded in permanently interrupting transmission using MDA as one of several malaria-control strategies. However, although unable to interrupt transmission, many MDA projects led to a marked reduction in parasite prevalence and probably had a marked also transient effect on malaria-related [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. Most of the early trials used study designs which would now be considered inadequate to provide a definitive answer on study outcome. For example, before-and-after comparisons were used frequently. Such comparisons are especially unreliable for vector-borne diseases which may show marked variations in incidence from season to season as well as from year to year. Furthermore, in several studies only a single intervention and control area or group were compared despite the fact a single control group cannot provide statistically interpretable results (see [[n = 1 fallacy|''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 fallacy]]).

The deficiencies in the study designs mentioned above reflect the evolution of research methodology over the last 50 years. The evaluation of an intervention such as MDA is complicated by the fact that the effect of the intervention on transmission can only be measured at the community and not at the individual level. [[Trial method]]s which use a community, a village, or a cluster as unit of inference have taken longer to evolve than those used for [[individually randomized trial]]s. There are, with some notable exceptions, few properly designed and analysed [[cluster randomized trial]]s conducted by health care researchers prior to 1978. One major handicap for researchers who need to use the cluster approach, besides the need for a large sample size, is the need to use [[statistical methods]] that differ from the familiar methods used in individually randomized trials. Significant progress has been made in the development of statistical methods for the analysis of [[correlation|correlated data]].

==MDA and drug resistance==
The present unpopularity of MDA is not only due to doubts regarding the health benefit of this intervention but to the fear that MDAs will facilitate the spread of [[drug resistance]]. Concern that MDA would cause [[pyrimethamine]] and later [[chloroquine]] resistance was first raised in the early 1960s. Circumstantial evidence linked the use of [[medicated salts]] to the emergence of chloroquine resistance in the 1980s: Chloroquine resistance emerged first in three foci, namely [[South America]] ([[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Brazil]]), [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Thailand]]/[[Kampuchea]]), and [[Africa]] ([[Tanzania]]/[[Kenya]]). Payne has argued that the one common factor between these three epidemiologically diverse areas was widespread distribution of medicated salts prior to the emergence of chloroquine resistance.<ref name="pmid15463062"/>

In contrast to indirect MDA, emergence of drug resistance has not been linked to the administration of [[therapeutic doses]] of antimalarials through direct MDA programmes. The likely explanation lies in the different [[pharmacokinetic]] profiles that result from these two methods of drug administration. The administration of therapeutically dosed antimalarial drugs results in a single peak drug level which kills all susceptible strains. Only during the [[terminal half life]] of the drug when the concentration drops below the C<sub>min</sub>, the [[inhibitory concentration]] which kills the large majority of a parasite population, will new infections with more resistant strains have a [[survival advantage]]. Thus drugs with a very short terminal half life, including [[artemisinin derivatives]], carry a lower risk of selecting resistant parasites than longer acting drugs. In contrast, the administration of medicated salts is likely to result in drug levels undulating in the sub-lethal range, which reach a [[steady state]] after several doses have been administered. The situation is worse if drugs such as [[chloroquine]] are used which accumulate progressively. This situation, a steady increase in drug concentration, is identical to the experimental design used for the in vitro induction of drug resistance.<ref name="pmid8799803">{{cite journal |author=Bhasin VK, Nair L |title=In vitro selection of Plasmodium falciparum lines resistant to dihydrofolate-reductase inhibitors and cross resistance studies |journal=Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |year=1996 |month=February |pmid=8799803 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Medicated salt projects can be considered as large scale ''in vivo'' experiments designed to select resistant parasites.

==MDA and drug toxicity==
The administration of antimalarials to large numbers of individuals with little or no preliminary screening could result in significant [[toxicity]] as nearly all antimalarials in common use can occasionally cause serious adverse events. For example the widespread use of 8-aminoquinolones in areas where [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] is common carries the risk of precipitating episodes of [[haemolysis]]. Few MDA projects have reported specifically on adverse events. No life-threatening outcomes have been reported as a result of an MDA but a rare serious adverse event such as a blood dyscrasia would probably not have been detected without active surveillance for adverse events which was not reported in any of the studies. There is a theoretical risk that administration of antimalarial drugs during the course of MDAs to women in the first trimester of pregnancy, some of whom may not know that they are pregnant, could lead to foetal abnormalities. The benefit of malaria control has to be weighed against potential problems. Hence MDA is likely to be only used in areas with very high malaria endemicity.
