'''Garlic allergy''' or [[allergic contact dermatitis]] to [[garlic]] is a common inflammatory skin condition caused by contact with garlic oil or dust. It mostly affects people who cut and handle fresh garlic, such as [[chef]]s,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Dj9asUfurpcC&pg=PA396|page=396|title=Condensed handbook of occupational dermatology|author=Lasse Kanerva, Peter Elsner, Jan E. Wahlberg, Howard I. Maibach|publisher=Springer|year=2004|isbn=3-540-44348-7}}</ref> and presents on the tips of the thumb, index and middle fingers of the non-dominant hand (which typically hold garlic bulbs during the cutting). The affected fingertips show an asymmetrical pattern of [[fissure]] as well as [[Hyperkeratosis|thickening]] and [[Desquamation|shedding]] of the outer skin layers, which may progress to second- or third-degree [[burn]] of injured skin.<ref name=b1>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=f2IwYiyh3YUC&pg=PT305|page=305|title=Dermatology, Volume 2|author=Thomas D.

Garlic dermatitis is similar to the [[tulip]] dermatitis and is induced by a combined mechanical and chemical action. Whereas the former mechanism acts via skin rubbing which progresses into damage, the major cause of the latter is the chemical [[diallyl disulfide]] (DADS),<ref name=b1/> together  with related compounds [[allyl propyl disulfide]] and [[allicin]]. These chemicals occur in oils of plants of the genus ''[[Allium]]'', including garlic, [[onion]] and [[leek]].<ref name=b2>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6AB89RHV9ucC&pg=PA288|page=228|title=Garlic and other alliums: the lore and the science|author=Eric Block|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2009|isbn=0-85404-190-7}}</ref>

Garlic allergy has been known since at least 1950. It is not limited to hand contact, but can also be induced, with different symptoms, by inhaling garlic dust or ingesting raw garlic, though the latter cases are relatively rare.<ref name=b2/> DADS penetrates through most types of commercial gloves, and thus wearing gloves while handling garlic has proven inefficient against the allergy.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=15527433|year=2004|last1=Moyle|first1=M|last2=Frowen|first2=K|last3=Nixon|first3=R|title=Use of gloves in protection from diallyl disulphide allergy.|volume=45|issue=4|pages=223–5|doi=10.1111/j.1440-0960.2004.00102.x|journal=The Australasian journal of dermatology}}</ref> Treatment includes avoiding any contact with garlic oil or vapors, as well as medication, such as administering [[acitretin]] (25 mg/day, orally) or applying [[psoralen]] and ultraviolet light to the affected skin area over a period of 12 weeks (the so-called [[PUVA therapy]]).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dQBAzfyCeQ8C&pg=PA723|page=723|title=Fisher's contact dermatitis|author=Robert L.
