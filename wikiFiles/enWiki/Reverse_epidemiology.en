'''Reverse epidemiology''' is a term for a medical [[hypothesis]] which holds that [[obesity]] and [[hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]] may, [[counterintuitive]]ly, be protective and associated with greater survival in certain groups of people, such as very elderly individuals or those with certain [[chronic disease]]s. It further postulates that normal to low [[body mass index]] or normal values of [[cholesterol]] may be detrimental and associated with higher [[Mortality rate|mortality]] in asymptomatic people.

The terminology was first proposed by [[Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh]] in the journal ''Kidney International'' in 2003<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00803.x |title=Reverse epidemiology of cardiovascular risk factors in maintenance dialysis patients |year=2003 |last1=Kalantar-Zadeh |first1=Kamyar |last2=Block |first2=Gladys |last3=Humphreys |first3=Michael H. |last4=Kopple |first4=Joel D. |journal=Kidney International |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=793–808 |pmid=12631061}}</ref> and in the ''Journal of American College of Cardiology'' in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2003.11.039 |title=Reverse epidemiology of conventional cardiovascular risk factors in patients with chronic heart failure |year=2004 |last1=Kalantar-Zadeh |first1=Kamyar |last2=Block |first2=Gladys |last3=Horwich |first3=Tamara |last4=Fonarow |first4=Gregg C |journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=1439–44 |pmid=15093881}}</ref>  It is a contradiction to prevailing concepts of prevention of [[atherosclerosis]] and [[cardiovascular disease]]; however, active [[prophylaxis|prophylactic treatment]] of heart disease in otherwise healthy, asymptomatic people is and has been controversial in the medical community for several years.<ref name="Naghavi">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.hpc.0000249784.29151.54 |title=The First SHAPE (Screening for Heart Attack Prevention and Education) Guideline |year=2006 |last1=Naghavi |first1=Morteza |last2=Falk |first2=Erling |last3=Hecht |first3=Harvey S. |last4=Shah |first4=Prediman K. |journal=Critical Pathways in Cardiology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=187–90 |pmid=18340236 |author5=Shape Task Force}}</ref><ref name="Pearson">{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.26.1.49 |title=The Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease: Have We Really Made Progress? |year=2007 |last1=Pearson |first1=T.

==Obesity survival paradox==
Although the negative health consequences of obesity in the general population are well supported by the available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox.<ref name=Schmidt2007>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1525-139X.2007.00349.x |title=CARDIOVASCULAR AND SURVIVAL PARADOXES IN DIALYSIS PATIENTS: Obesity-Survival Paradox-Still a Controversy? |year=2007 |last1=Schmidt |first1=Darren S. |last2=Salahudeen |first2=Abdulla K. |journal=Seminars in Dialysis |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=486–92 |pmid=17991192}}</ref> The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis,<ref name=Schmidt2007/> and has subsequently been found in those with [[heart failure]], and [[Peripheral vascular disease|peripheral artery disease]] (PAD).<ref name=paradox2003>{{cite journal |pmid=12825847 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=12825847 |year=2003 |author1=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force |title=Behavioral counseling in primary care to promote a healthy diet: Recommendations and rationale |volume=67 |issue=12 |pages=2573–6 |journal=American family physician}}</ref>

In people with heart failure, those with a BMI between 30.0–34.9 had lower mortality than those with a normal weight. This has been attributed to the fact that people often lose weight as they become progressively more ill.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2006.04.039 |title=The Obesity Paradox: Fact or Fiction? |year=2006 |last1=Habbu |first1=Amit |last2=Lakkis |first2=Nasser M. |last3=Dokainish |first3=Hisham |journal=The American Journal of Cardiology |volume=98 |issue=7 |pages=944–8 |pmid=16996880}}</ref> Similar findings have been made in other types of heart disease. People with class I obesity and heart disease do not have greater rates of further heart problems than people of normal weight who also have heart disease.
