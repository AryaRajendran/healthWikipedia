The term '''pudendal neuralgia (PN)''' is used interchangeably with "pudendal nerve entrapment", but a 2009 review study found both that "prevalence of PN is unknown and it seems to be a rare event" and that "there is no evidence to support equating the presence of this syndrome with a diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment," meaning that it is possible to have all the symptoms of pudendal nerve entrapment (otherwise known as pudendal neuralgia) based on the criteria specified at Nantes in 2006, without having an entrapped pudendal nerve.<ref name="Stav-2009">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Stav | first1 = K. | last2 = Dwyer | first2 = PL. | last3 = Roberts | first3 = L. | title = Pudendal neuralgia.

==Symptoms== 
The main symptom is [[neuropathic pain]] in the anorectal, perineal, and/or genital regions.  The pain is worst when sitting and can characteristically be described as burning, stabbing, or aching.  Patients may report allodynia, pain from what should be non-painful stimuli (such as light contact with clothing).  Often, patients will complain of sensing a foreign body in the rectum when no object is actually present.  In many patients, the pain predominates on either the right or left side.<ref name="Labat-2008">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Labat | first1 = JJ. | last2 = Riant | first2 = T. | last3 = Robert | first3 = R. | last4 = Amarenco | first4 = G. | last5 = Lefaucheur | first5 = JP. | last6 = Rigaud | first6 = J. | title = Diagnostic criteria for pudendal neuralgia by pudendal nerve entrapment (Nantes criteria). | journal = Neurourol Urodyn | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 306–10 | month =  | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1002/nau.20505 | PMID = 17828787 }}</ref>

The typical symptoms of PNE or PN are seen, for example, in male competitive cyclists (it is often called "cyclist syndrome<ref name="Durante-2010"/>), who can rarely develop recurrent [[numbness]] of the [[penis]] and [[scrotum]] after prolonged cycling, or an altered sensation of [[ejaculation]], with disturbance of [[micturition]] (urination) and reduced awareness of [[defecation]].<ref name="Silbert-1991">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Silbert | first1 = PL. | last2 = Dunne | first2 = JW. | last3 = Edis | first3 = RH. | last4 = Stewart-Wynne | first4 = EG. | title = Bicycling induced pudendal nerve pressure neuropathy. | journal = Clin Exp Neurol | volume = 28 | issue =  | pages = 191–6 | month =  | year = 1991 | doi =  | PMID = 1821826 }}</ref><ref name="Oberpenning-1994">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Oberpenning | first1 = F. | last2 = Roth | first2 = S. | last3 = Leusmann | first3 = DB. | last4 = van Ahlen | first4 = H. | last5 = Hertle | first5 = L. | title = The Alcock syndrome: temporary penile insensitivity due to compression of the pudendal nerve within the Alcock canal. | journal = J Urol | volume = 151 | issue = 2 | pages = 423–5 | month = Feb | year = 1994 | doi =  | PMID = 8283544 }}</ref> Nerve entrapment syndromes, presenting as genitalia numbness, are amongst the most common bicycling associated urogenital problems.<ref name="Leibovitch-2005">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Leibovitch | first1 = I. | last2 = Mor | first2 = Y. | title = The vicious cycling: bicycling related urogenital disorders. | journal = Eur Urol | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 277-86; discussion 286-7 | month = Mar | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.eururo.2004.10.024 | PMID = 15716187 }}</ref>

[[Differential diagnosis]] should consider the far commoner conditions [[chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome]] and [[interstitial cystitis]].<ref name="Hough"/>

==Tests and Imaging==
Similar to a [[tinel sign]] digital palpitation of the [[ischial spine]] may produce pain.  In contrast, patients may report temporary relief with a diagnostic pudendal nerve block (see [[#Injections | Injections]]), typically infiltrated near the [[ischial spine]].<ref name="Ramsden-2003"/><ref name="Labat-2008"/>. 

[[Electromyography]] can be used to measure motor latency along the pudendal nerve.  A greater than normal conduction delay can indicate entrapment of the nerve.<ref name="Ramsden-2003"/>

Imaging studies using [[magnetic resonance imaging|MR neurography]] may be useful. In patients with unilateral pudendal entrapment in the [[Alcock's canal]], it is typical to see asymmetric swelling and hyperintensity affecting the pudendal neurovascular bundle.<ref>{{cite journal |pmc=2924821 |title=MR Neurography and Diffusion Tensor Imaging: Origins, History & Clinical Impact of the first 50,000 cases with an Assessment of Efficacy and Utility in a Prospective 5,000 Patient Study Group |publisher= | pmid=19927075 |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000351279.78110.00 |volume=65 |issue=4 Suppl |year=2009 |month=October |journal=Neurosurgery |pages=A29–43}}</ref>

==Causes==
PNE can be caused by [[pregnancy]], scarring due to [[surgery]], accidents and surgical mishaps.<ref name="Alevizon-1996">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Alevizon | first1 = SJ. | last2 = Finan | first2 = MA. | title = Sacrospinous colpopexy: management of postoperative pudendal nerve entrapment. | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 88 | issue = 4 Pt 2 | pages = 713–5 | month = Oct | year = 1996 | doi =  | PMID = 8841264 }}</ref>  Anatomic abnormalities can result in PNE due to the pudendal nerve being fused to different parts of the anatomy, or trapped between the sacrotuberous and sacrospinalis [[ligament]]s.  Heavy and prolonged [[cycling|bicycling]], especially if an inappropriately shaped or incorrectly  positioned bicycle seat is used, may eventually thicken the sacrotuberous and/or sacrospinous ligaments and trap the nerve between them, resulting in PNE.

==Treatment==
Optional treatments include behavioral modifications, physical therapy, analgesics and other medications, pudendal nerve block, and surgical nerve decompression.<ref name="Stav-2009"/> A newer form of treatment is pulsed radiofrequency.<ref name="Rhame-">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rhame | first1 = EE. | last2 = Levey | first2 = KA. | last3 = Gharibo | first3 = CG. | title = Successful treatment of refractory pudendal neuralgia with pulsed radiofrequency. | journal = Pain Physician | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 633–8 | month =  | year =  2009| doi =  | PMID = 19461829 }}</ref>

===Physical therapy===
There are stretches and exercises which have provided reduced levels of pain for some people. There are different sources of pain for people since there are so many ligament, muscles and nerves in the area. Sometimes women do pelvic floor exercises for compression after childbirth. However, there have been cases where the wrong stretches make the constant pain worse. Some people need to strengthen the muscles, others should stretch, while for some people it is purely [[neurological]]. There have been cases where doing stretches have helped bicyclists. A helpful stretch for some is bending over and touching your toes. Another stretch includes bringing your knee to your chest on the compressed side while laying on your back. One more possibly helpful stretch for bicyclists include sitting in the lotus position and moving your head to the ground supporting yourself with your hands and keeping your buttocks up. Stretches should not be held long (about 8 seconds) and be spread out through the day. [[Acupuncture]] has helped decrease pain levels for some people, but is generally ineffective.{{citation needed|date=February 2008}} Chiropractic adjustments to the lower back have also helped some patients with pudendal nerve issues.

===Medications===
There are numerous pharmaceutical treatments for [[neuropathic pain]] associated with pudendal neuralgia.  Drugs used include [[anticonvulsant|anti-epileptics]] (like [[gabapentin]]<ref name="Rhame-"/>), [[antidepressant]]s (like [[amitriptyline]]<ref name="Hough"/>), and [[palmitoylethanolamide]].<ref name="Calabrò-2010">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Calabrò | first1 = RS. | last2 = Gervasi | first2 = G. | last3 = Marino | first3 = S. | last4 = Mondo | first4 = PN. | last5 = Bramanti | first5 = P. | title = Misdiagnosed chronic pelvic pain: pudendal neuralgia responding to a novel use of palmitoylethanolamide. | journal = Pain Med | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 781–4 | month = May | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1111/j.1526-4637.2010.00823.x | PMID = 20345619 }}</ref>

===Injections===
Alcock canal infiltration with corticosteroids is a minimally invasive technique which allows for pain relief and could be tried when physical therapy has failed and before surgery. A long-acting local [[anesthetic]] ([[bupivacaine]] hydrochloride) and a [[corticosteroid]] (e.g. [[methylprednisolone]]) are injected to provide immediate pudendal [[anesthesia]].<ref name="Hough"/> The injections may also bring a long-term response because the anti-inflammatory effects of the [[steroid]] and steroid-induced fat [[necrosis]] can reduce inflammation in the region around the nerve and decrease pressure on the nerve itself. This treatment may be effective in 65–73% of patients.<ref name="Hough"/>

===Pulsed radiofrequency===
[[Pulsed radiofrequency]] has been successful in treating a refractory case of PNE.<ref name="Rhame-"/>

===Surgical===
Decompression surgery is a "last resort", according to surgeons who perform the operation.<ref name="Robert-2009"/> The surgery is performed by a small number of surgeons in a limited number of countries. The validity of decompression surgery as a treatment and the existence of entrapment as a cause of pelvic pain are highly controversial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.med.nyu.edu/neurosurgery/pns/conditions/compressions/pelvis/pudendal.html |title=Pudendal Nerve Entrapment | Department of Neurosurgery | NYU Medical Center, New York, NY |publisher=www.med.nyu.edu |accessdate=2010-12-14 }}</ref><ref name="Spinner-2006">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Spinner | first1 = RJ. | title = Outcomes for peripheral nerve entrapment syndromes. | journal = Clin Neurosurg | volume = 53 | issue =  | pages = 285–94 | url = http://www.cns.org/publications/clinical/53/pdf/cnb00106000285.pdf | year = 2006 | doi =  | PMID = 17380764 }}</ref> While a few doctors will prescribe decompression surgery, most will not. Notably, in February 2003 the [[European Association of Urology]] in its ''Guidelines on Pelvic Pain'' said<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uroweb.org/?id=218&gid=17 |title=European Association of Urology (EAU) - Guidelines |publisher=www.uroweb.org |accessdate=2010-06-16 }}</ref> that expert centers in Europe have found no cases of PNE and that surgical success is rare:

{{quotation|Pudendal nerve neuropathy is likely to be a probable diagnosis if the pain is unilateral, has a burning quality and is exacerbated by unilateral rectal palpation of the ischial spine, with delayed pudendal motor latency on that side only. However, such cases account for only a small proportion of all those presenting with perineal pain. Proof of diagnosis rests on pain relief following decompression of the nerve in Alcock’s canal and is rarely achieved. The value of the clinical neurophysiological investigations is debatable; some centres in Europe claim that the investigations have great sensitivity, while other centres, which also have a specialized interest in pelvic floor neurophysiology, have not identified any cases.|European Association of Urology|Guidelines on Chronic Pelvic Pain}}

Three types of surgery have been done to decompress the pudendal nerve: transperineal, transgluteal, and transichiorectal. A follow-up of patients of this surgery after 4 years found that 50% felt their pain had improved to various extents, although control patients were not followed up for comparison.<ref name="Robert-2005">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Robert | first1 = R. | last2 = Labat | first2 = JJ. | last3 = Bensignor | first3 = M. | last4 = Glemain | first4 = P. | last5 = Deschamps | first5 = C. | last6 = Raoul | first6 = S. | last7 = Hamel | first7 = O. | title = Decompression and transposition of the pudendal nerve in pudendal neuralgia: a randomized controlled trial and long-term evaluation. | journal = Eur Urol | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 403–8 | month = Mar | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.eururo.2004.09.003 | PMID = 15716208 }}</ref> If surgery does bring relief of symptoms, patients will mostly experience it within 4 weeks of surgery.<ref name="Filler-2009">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Filler | first1 = AG. | title = Diagnosis and treatment of pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome subtypes: imaging, injections, and minimal access surgery. | journal = Neurosurg Focus | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = E9 | month = Feb | year = 2009 | doi = 10.3171/FOC.2009.26.2.E9 | PMID = 19323602 }}</ref>

However, the studies and surgical methods cited above generally focused on the Alcock’s canal and the area between the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments as likely sites for entrapment. More recent studies have identified possible entrapment sites anterior to Alcock’s canal.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hruby |first1 = S. | title =  Anatomy of Pudendal Nerve at Urogenital Diaphragm—New Critical Site for Nerve Entrapment. | journal = Urology | volume = 66 (5) | pages = 949–952 | month = May | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2005.05.032 | pmid=16286101}}</ref>
