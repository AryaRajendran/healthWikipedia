'''Trauma models of mental disorders''' (alternatively called '''trauma models of psychopathology''') emphasize the effects of [[psychological trauma]], particularly in early development, as the key causal factor in the development of some or many psychiatric disorders, in addition to trauma as an adult as in [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].

Trauma models are typically founded on the view that traumatic experiences (including but not limited to actual physical or sexual abuse) are more common or more serious than thought in the histories of those diagnosed with mental disorders. Such models have traditionally been associated with [[psychoanalytic]] approaches, notably [[Sigmund Freud]]'s early ideas on childhood sexual abuse and [[hysteria]].

[[John Bowlby]], who developed [[attachment theory]], also describes the negative mental health consequences, based on his observations, of the effects on infants and young children when a positive relationship with a caregiver is lacking.<ref>Cassidy, J., & Shaver, P., (Eds). (1999) ''Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Applications''. Guilford Press, NY</ref> In addition there is significant research supporting the linkage between early experiences of chronic maltreatment and later problems.<ref>Main, M. & Hesse, E. (1990). "Parents' unresolved traumatic experiences are related to infant disorganized attachment status: Is frightened and/or frightening parental behavior the linking mechanism?" In Greenberg, M., Cicchetti, D., and Cummings, M. (Eds.), ''Attachment In The Preschool Years: Theory, Research, and Intervention''. Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]].</ref>

In the 1960s trauma models also became associated with [[humanistic psychology|humanist]] and [[anti-psychiatry]] approaches, particularly in regard to understanding schizophrenia and the role of the family.{{MEDRS|date=September 2012}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lilienfeld |first=Scott |title=Will the real pseudoscientists please stand up? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume= November/December |page=45 |year=1995}}</ref> Personality disorders have also been a focus, particularly [[borderline personality disorder]]. Extreme versions of trauma models have implicated the fetal environment and the trauma of being born, or have been associated with [[recovered memory]] controversies.

More generally, trauma models highlight particularly [[burnout (psychology)|stressful]] and traumatic factors in early attachment relations and in the development of mature interpersonal relationships. They are often presented as a counterpoint to a psychiatry claimed to be too focused on genetics, neurochemistry and medication.

==History==
In the 1940s, '50s, '60s and '70s some [[mental health]] professionals proposed trauma models to understand schizophrenia: [[Harry Stack Sullivan]], [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]], [[Theodore Lidz]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Silvano Arieti]], [[R.D. Laing]] and others. They held that schizophrenia is induced by experiences in profoundly disturbed families, or by attempts to cope with a damaging society. In the 1950s Sullivan's theory that schizophrenia is related to interpersonal relationships was widely accepted in the United States.

The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], or DSM, does not claim that the specific etiology of schizophrenia and other serious [[psychoses]] has been established. However, the psychogenic models proposed by these early researchers such as the "schizophrenogenic mother" are no longer accepted in the psychiatric profession. Since the 1960s pharmacological treatments became the increasing focus of psychiatry, and by the 1980s the theory that the family dynamics could be implicated in schizophrenia became unacceptable in Germany.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hahlweg |first=K |coauthors=et al. |title="Familienbetreuung als verhaltenstherapeutischer Ansatz zur Ruckfallprophylaxe bei schizophrenen Patienten", in M. Krausz, D. Naber (eds.) ''Integrative Schizophrenietherapie'' |publisher=Freiburg: Karger |year=2000}}</ref>

Before his death in 2001, aged ninety, Lidz, one of the main proponents of the "schizophrenogenic" parents theory, expressed regret that current research in [[biological psychiatry]] is "barking up the wrong tree".<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v29.n21/story14.html]&nbsp;– article on Theodore Lidz</ref> Like Lidz, Laing maintained until his death that the cause of both [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid personalities]] and schizophrenia was influenced by family relationships.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

In 1975 Silvano Arieti won the American [[National Book Award]] in the field of science for his book, ''[[Interpretation of Schizophrenia]]'', which advances a psychological model for understanding all the regressive types of the disorder.<ref>[http://www.associazionesilvanoarieti.org/english/sa_curriculum.html associazionesilvanoarieti.org]&nbsp;– page on Arieti (mostly in Italian)</ref> According to more recent research, [[child abuse]] at home plays a causal role in [[clinical depression|depression]], [[PTSD]], [[eating disorders]], [[substance abuse]] and [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociative disorders]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kendler |first=K |coauthors=et al. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |title=Childhood sexual abuse and adult psychiatric and substance use disorders in women |volume=57 |pages=953–959 |year=2000 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.57.10.953 |pmid=11015813 |issue=10}}</ref>

The more severe the abuse the more probability symptoms will develop in adult life.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mullen |coauthors=et al. |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |title=Childhood sexual abuse and mental health in adult life |volume=163 |pages=721–32 |year=1993 |doi=10.1192/bjp.163.6.721 |first1=P. E. |pmid=8306113 |issue=6}}</ref> In the psychiatric field it is hypothesized that child abuse is less related to the most serious psychoses, such as schizophrenia.{{Verify source|date=April 2009}} However, some mental health professionals maintain that the relationship is stronger in psychoses than [[neuroses]].{{dubious|date=September 2012}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Emma |coauthors=Jim Burdett |title="Preventing 'schizophrenia': creating the conditions for saner societies" in Read et al., Models of Madness |publisher=Routledge |year=2004}}</ref>

==A common critical argument==
Critics of the model, such as August Piper Jr., argue that the logic of the claim that childhood trauma causes insanity demonstrates a serious flaw. If the claim were true, critics contend, the abuse of millions of children over the years should have caused many cases of insanity; but no evidence exists.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Piper |first=August |title= Multiple personality disorder: witchcraft survives in the twentieth century |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=May/June |year=1998}}</ref>

Arieti had addressed this line of argumentation, stating that the only persons before whom young human beings are vulnerable are the ones to whom they are [[human bonding|emotionally bonded]] in childhood. A passage of ''Interpretation of Schizophrenia'', originally published in 1955, sheds light on the heart of the trauma model:
{{Cquote|First of all we have to repeat here what we already mentioned [...], that conditions of obvious external danger, as in the case of wars, disasters, or other adversities that affect the collectivity, do not produce the type of anxiety that hurts the [[consciousness|inner self]] and do not themselves favor schizophrenia. Even extreme [[poverty]], physical illness, or personal tragedies do not necessarily lead to schizophrenia unless they have psychological ramifications that hurt the sense of self. Even homes broken by death, [[divorce]] or desertion may be less destructive than homes where both parents are alive, live together, and always undermine the child's conception of himself.<ref>{{cite book |last=Arieti |first=Silvano |title=Interpretation of Schizophrenia |publisher=Aronson |year=1994 |page=197}}</ref>}}

==Recent approaches==
In more recent years psychologist [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]], author of twelve books on mental distress and disorders, including non-psychiatric conditions like falling prey to [[cult]]s, has informed future parents and former victims about the disastrous consequences of child abuse. 

The "trauma model of mental disorders" is the name given by [[psychiatrist]] Colin A. Ross to his specific model, which is presented as a solution to the problem of [[comorbidity]] in the [[mental health]] field.<ref>[http://www.rossinst.com/trauma.htm]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&nbsp;– Colin Ross' web site</ref> An information packet given to inpatients at the [[Ross Institute for Psychological Trauma]] describes the theoretical basis of his trauma model in [[common sense|commonsensical]] terms:
{{Cquote|The problem faced by many patients is that they did not grow up in a reasonably healthy, normal family. They grew up in an inconsistent, abusive and traumatic family. The very people to whom the child had to attach for survival, were also abuse perpetrators and hurt him or her badly [...] The basic conflict, the deepest pain, and the deepest source of symptoms, is the fact that mom and dad's behavior hurts, did not fit together, and did not make sense.}}

In ''Schizophrenia: an Innovative Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Colin |first=Ross |title=Schizophrenia: An Innovative Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2004}}</ref> Ross determines that some patients diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] have symptoms related to [[dissociative identity disorder]].<ref>[http://www.rossinst.com/schizophrenia_book.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2012}} Ross’ book on schizophrenia</ref>

The family conditions during infancy are at present considered virtually irrelevant in the psychiatric profession.{{dubious|date=September 2012}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=Lucy |title=Family management in "schizophrenia": its assumptions and contradictions |journal=Journal of Mental Health |volume=2 |pages=255–69 |year=1993 |doi=10.3109/09638239309003771 |issue=3}}</ref> According to some critics, the goal of modern psychiatric treatment is not to understand how parents could have contributed to the problem or how it can be resolved by improving the relationship. The objective is how to reduce the burden of a psychotic crisis for the family through medication of the disturbed individual. As two trauma researchers have put it, "the ideology of [[mechanism (philosophy)|biological reductionism]]" in psychiatry is "to exonerate the family."<ref>{{cite book |last=Aderhold |first=Volkmar |coauthors=Evelyn Gottwalz |title=Family therapy and schizophrenia: replacing ideology with openness” in Read et al., Models of Madness |publisher=Routledge |year=2004}}</ref>

In 2006 a UK researcher and a New Zealand clinical psychologist presented a meta-analysis of schizophrenia studies<ref>{{cite journal |author=Read J, van Os J, Morrison AP, Ross CA |title=Childhood trauma, psychosis and schizophrenia: a literature review with theoretical and clinical implications |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=112 |issue=5 |pages=330–50 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16223421 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00634.x}}</ref> to psychiatric conferences which they claimed demonstrated that the prevalence of physical and sexual abuse in the histories of those with schizophrenia is very high and is being under-studied.

The researchers admit that not all schizophrenics suffered trauma, but they believe "the level of actual abuse may be an important difference". While conceding that genetics may still be a causative risk factor they maintain "other evidence shows that genes alone do not cause the illness."  The review caused considerable debate<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20060514024158data_trunc_sys.shtml |title=Media report of sexual abuse as cause of schizophrenia |accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/podcast/?id=208&type=item |title=Maudsley debate on sexual abuse as a cause of schizophrenia |accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref>

In the field of [[criminology]], Lonnie Athens developed a theory of how a process of brutalization by parents or peers that usually occurs in childhood results in violent crimes in adulthood. [[Richard Rhodes]]' ''Why They Kill'' describes Athens' observations about domestic and societal violence in the criminals' backgrounds. Both Athens and Rhodes reject the genetic inheritance theories.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rhodes |first=Richard |title=Why They Kill: The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist |publisher=Vintage |year=2000 |isbn= 0-375-40249-7}}</ref>

Other criminologists such as [[Jonathan Pincus]] and [[Dorothy Otnow Lewis]] believe that, although it is the interaction of childhood abuse and neurological disturbances that explains murder, virtually all of the 150 murderers they studied over a 25-year period had suffered severe abuse as children. Pincus believes that the only feasible remedy for crime would be the prevention of child abuse.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pincus |first=Jonathan |title=Base Instincts: What Makes Killers Kill |publisher=W.W. Norton & Company |year=2002 |isbn= 0-393-05022-X}}</ref>

A 2012 review article supports the hypothesis that current or recent trauma may affect an individual's assessment of the more distant past, changing the experience of the past and resulting in dissociative states.<ref name="pmid22423434">{{cite journal
