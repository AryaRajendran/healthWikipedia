'''Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN)''' is the direct  imaging of [[nerve]]s in the body by optimizing selectivity for unique MRI water properties  of nerves. It is a modification of [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. This technique yields a detailed image of a nerve from  the resonance signal that arises from in the nerve itself rather than from surrounding tissues or from fat in the nerve lining. Because of the intraneural source of the image signal, the image provides a medically useful set of information about the internal state of the nerve such as the presence of irritation, nerve swelling ([[edema]]), compression, pinch or injury. Standard magnetic resonance images can show the outline of some nerves in portions of their courses but do not show the intrinsic signal from nerve water. Magnetic resonance neurography is used to evaluate major nerve compressions such as those affecting the [[sciatic nerve]] (e.g. [[piriformis syndrome]]), the [[brachial plexus]] nerves (e.g. [[thoracic outlet syndrome]]), the [[pudendal nerve]], or virtually any named nerve in the body. A related technique for imaging neural tracts in the brain and spinal cord is called magnetic resonance [[tractography]] or [[diffusion tensor imaging]].

==History and physical basis==
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is based on differences in the physical properties of [[proton]]s in [[Water (molecule)|water molecules]] in different tissues in the body. The protons and the water molecules of which they are part have subtly different movement characteristics that relate to their [[Biophysics|biophysical]] surroundings. Because of this, MRI is capable of differentiating one tissue from another; this provides "tissue contrast." From the time of the first clinical use of MRI in the mid 1970s until 1992, however, despite the active work of many thousands of researchers, there was no reliable method for visualizing nerve. In some parts of the body, nerves could be observed as areas of absent signal delineated by bright fat, or as bland grey structures that could not be reliably distinguished from other similar-appearing structures in cross sectional images. 

In 1992, Aaron Filler and Franklyn Howe, working at [[St George's Hospital|St. George's Hospital Medical School]] in London, succeeded in identifying the unique water properties of nerve water that would make it possible to generate tissue-specific nerve images.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Howe FA, Filler AG, Bell BA, Griffiths JR |title=Magnetic resonance neurography |journal=Magn Reson Med |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=328–38 |year=1992 |month=December |pmid=1461131 |doi= 10.1002/mrm.1910280215|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Filler AG, Howe FA, Hayes CE, Kliot M, Winn HR, Bell BA, Griffiths JR, Tsuruda JS. |title=Magnetic resonance neurography |journal=Lancet |volume=341 |issue=8846 |pages=659–61 |year=1993 |month=March |pmid=8095572 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(93)90422-D}}</ref><ref>Filler AG, Tsuruda JS, Richards TL, Howe FA: Images, apparatus, algorithms and methods.[http://www.neurography.com/aaronfiller.html#patents GB 9216383], UK Patent Office, 1992.</ref><ref>Filler AG, Tsuruda JS, Richards TL, Howe FA: [http://www.patentmonkey.com/PM/patentid/5560360.aspx Image Neurography and Diffusion Anisotropy Imaging]. US 5,560,360, United States Patent Office, 1993.</ref> The result was an initial "pure" nerve image in which every other tissue was made to disappear leaving behind only the image of the nerves. The initial pure nerve image served as the basis of image processing techniques leading to discovery of a series of other MRI [[Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging#Example of a Pulse Sequence|pulse sequence]] techniques that would make nerves imageable as well. Further, because they demonstrate water signal arising in the neural tissue itself, they can also reveal abnormalities that affect only the nerve and that do not affect surrounding tissues. More than three million patients seek medical attention every year for nerve-related disorders such as [[sciatica]], [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] or various other [[nerve injury|nerve injuries]], yet before 1992, no radiologists were trained to image nerves, and most physicians believed it simply could not be done usefully<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kline DG, Hudson AR, Zager E |title=Selection and preoperative work-up for peripheral nerve surgery| journal=Clin Neurosurg |volume=39 |pages=8–35 |year=1992 |pmid=1333932}}</ref>

There are two main physical bases for the imaging discovery. Firstly, it was known at the time that water diffused preferentially along the long axis of neural tissue in the brain – a property called "[[Diffusion MRI#Diffusion tensor imaging|anisotropic diffusion]]". [[Diffusion MRI]] had been developed to take advantage of this phenomenon to show contrast between [[white matter]] and [[grey matter]] in the [[brain]]. However, diffusion MRI proved ineffective for imaging of [[nerve]]s for reasons that were not initially clear. Filler and Howe discovered that the problem was that the most of the image signal in nerve came from protons that were not involved in anisotropic diffusion. They developed a collection of methods to suppress the "isotropic signal" and this resulted in allowing the anisotropic signal to be unmasked. This was based on the discovery that [[Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging#Contrast enhancement|Chemical Shift Selection]] could be used to suppress "short [[Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging#Resonance and Relaxation|T2]] water" in the nerve and that this mostly affected isotropic water. 

The [[Nerve#Anatomy|endoneurial fluid]] compartment in nerve can be unmasked by similar techniques resulting in a "T2" based neurography<ref>{{cite journal |author=Filler AG, Kliot M, Howe FA, Hayes CE, Saunders DE, Goodkin R, Bell BA, Winn HR, Griffiths JR, Tsuruda JS |title=Application of magnetic resonance neurography in the evaluation of patients with peripheral nerve pathology |journal=J. Neurosurg. |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=299–309 |year=1996 |month=August |pmid=8755760 |doi= 10.3171/jns.1996.85.2.0299|url=http://jnsonline.org/jns/issues/v85n2/pdf/n0850299.pdf |format=}} {{dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> as well as the original diffusion based neurography technique. Endoneurial fluid increases when nerve is compressed, irritated or injured, leading to nerve image hyperintensity in an marnetic resonance neurography image. Subsequent research has further demonstrated the biophysical basis for the ability of MR Neurography to show [[nerve injury]] and irritation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cudlip SA, Howe FA, Griffiths JR, Bell BA |title=Magnetic resonance neurography of peripheral nerve following experimental crush injury, and correlation with functional deficit |journal=J. Neurosurg. |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=755–9 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=11990818 |doi= 10.3171/jns.2002.96.4.0755|url=http://jnsonline.org/jns/issues/v96n4/full/n0960755_fs.html }} {{dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref>

Measurements of the T2 relaxation rate of nerve by Filler and Howe revealed that previous reports of a short relaxation time were wrong and that&mdash;once signal from [[lipid]] protons was suppressed&mdash;the primary image signal from nerve had long T2 relaxation rates best imaged with pulse sequence [[Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging#Example of a Pulse Sequence|echo times]] in the range of 50 to 100&nbsp;[[millisecond]]s. In addition, they later showed that T2-neurography differs from most other MR imaging in that the conspicuity or relative prominence of nerve is affected by the angle of [[voxel]] orientation during the acquisition of the image. When acquisitions are done with echo times below 40&nbsp;milliseconds, there can be "magic angle effects"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chappell KE, Robson MD, Stonebridge-Foster A, ''et al.'' |title=Magic angle effects in MR neurography |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=431–40 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15037469 |doi= |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15037469}}</ref> that provide some spurious information, so MR Neurography is always done with echo times greater than 40&nbsp;milliseconds. The need for long echo times also characterizes the type of inversion recovery [[Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging#Contrast enhancement|fat suppression]] sequences used for neurography nerve imaging.

Within a few months of the initial findings on diffusion-based nerve imaging, the diffusion technique for nerve imaging was adapted to permit for visualization of neural tracts in the [[spinal cord]] and brain via [[Diffusion MRI#Diffusion tensor imaging|Diffusion Tensor Imaging]].

==Clinical uses==
The most significant impact of magnetic resonance neurography is on the evaluation of the large proximal nerve elements such as the [[brachial plexus]] (the nerves between the [[cervical spine]] and the underarm that innervate shoulder, arm and hand),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhou L, Yousem DM, Chaudhry V |title=Role of magnetic resonance neurography in brachial plexus lesions |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=305–9 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15318341 |doi=10.1002/mus.20108}}</ref> the [[lumbosacral plexus]] (nerves between the lumbosacral spine and legs), the [[sciatic nerve]] in the pelvis,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lewis AM, Layzer R, Engstrom JW, Barbaro NM, Chin CT |title=Magnetic resonance neurography in extraspinal sciatica |journal=Arch.

Neurography has also been helpful for improving [http://www.backpain-guide.com/Chapter_Fig_folders/Ch09_Imaging_Folder/Ch09_Imaging.html image diagnosis in spine disorders]. It can help identify which spinal nerve is actually irritated as a supplement to routine spinal MRI. Standard spinal MRI only demonstrates the anatomy and numerous [[Spinal disc herniation|disk bulges]], [[bone spur]]s or [[stenosis|stenoses]] that may or may not actually cause nerve impingement symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dailey AT, Tsuruda JS, Goodkin R, ''et al.'' |title=Magnetic resonance neurography for cervical radiculopathy: a preliminary report |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=488–92 discussion 492 |year=1996 |month=March |pmid=8837800 |doi= 10.1097/00006123-199603000-00013|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0148-396X&volume=38&issue=3&spage=488}}</ref><ref>{{tr icon}} {{cite journal |author=Erdem CZ, Erdem LO, Cağavi F, Kalayci M, Gündoğdu S |title=[High resolution MR neurography in patients with cervical radiculopathy] |language=Turkish |journal=Tani Girisim Radyol |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=14–9 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15054696 |doi= |url=http://tgr.dergisi.org/pubmed.php3?year=2004&volume=10&issue=1&page=14}}</ref> 

Many nerves, such as the [[median nerve|median]] and [[ulnar nerve]] in the arm or the [[tibial nerve]] in the [[tarsal tunnel]], are just below the skin surface and can be tested for pathology with [[electromyography]], but this technique has always been difficult to apply for deep proximal nerves.

Use of magnetic resonance neurography is increasing in neurology and neurosurgery as the implications of its value in diagnosing various causes of sciatica becomes more widespread.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=19927075 |pmc=2924821 |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000351279.78110.00 |title=MR Neurography and Diffusion Tensor Imaging: Origins, History & Clinical Impact |year=2009 |last1=Filler |first1=Aaron |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=65 |pages=29–43 |issue=4 Suppl}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bendszus M, Stoll G |title=Technology Insight: Visualizing peripheral nerve injury using MRI |journal=Nat Clin Pract Neurol |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=46–53 |year=2005 |pmid=16932491 |doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0017}}</ref> There are 1.5 million lumbar MRI scans performed in the US each year for sciatica, leading to surgery for a herniated disk in about 300,000 patients per year.

Neurography has been applied increasingly to evaluate the distal nerve roots, lumbo-sacral plexus and proximal sciatic nerve in the pelvis and thigh to find other causes of sciatica.

Magnetic resonance neurography does not pose any diagnostic disadvantage relative to standard magnetic resonance imaging because neurography studies typically include high resolution standard MRI image series for anatomical reference along with the neurographic sequences. However, the patient will generally have a slightly longer time in the scanner compared to a routine MRI scan. Magnetic resonance neurography can only be performed in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging#Magnet|1.5 tesla and 3 tesla]] cylindrical type scanners and can't really be done effectively in lower power "open" MR scanners - this can pose significant challenges for [[claustrophobic]] patients. Although it has been in use for fifteen years and is the subject of more than 150 research publications, most insurance companies still classify this test as experimental and may decline reimbursement, resulting in the need to file appeals. Patients in some plans obtain standard insurance coverage for this widely used procedure.
