The '''second metacarpal bone''' ('''metacarpal bone of the [[index finger]]''') is the longest, and its base the largest, of all the [[Metacarpus|metacarpal bones]].<ref name="Gray's">''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (1918). See infobox.</ref>

== Human anatomy ==
Its base is prolonged upward and medialward, forming a prominent ridge.<ref name="Gray's" />

It presents four articular facets, three on the upper surface and one on the [[ulnar]] side:<ref name="Gray's" />
* Of the facets on the upper surface:
** the ''intermediate'' is the largest and is concave from side to side, convex from before backward for articulation with the [[lesser multangular]];
** the ''lateral'' is small, flat and oval for articulation with the [[greater multangular]];
** the ''medial'', on the summit of the ridge, is long and narrow for articulation with the [[capitate]].
* The facet on the ulnar side articulates with the [[third metacarpal]].

The [[extensor carpi radialis longus muscle]] is inserted on the dorsal surface and the [[flexor carpi radialis muscle]] on the [[volar]] surface of the base.<ref name="Gray's" />

This bone is often the most prone to damage from fast bowlers in [[cricket]], as it is furthest down the bat handle on both left- and right-handers, and as such is in danger of being struck by balls that are pitched short.<ref>Laven , Kate. "West Indies' Courtney Walsh still in love with cricket." Daily Telegraph [London] 05 MAY 2009 Print.</ref>

== Evolution ==
The articulation between the second metacarpal and the capitate is considered uniquely specialized in [[hominid]]s.  On the second metacarpal, the facet for the capitate is directed proximally, almost perpendicular to the facet for the third metacarpal, while the corresponding facet on the capitate is oriented distally.  This is to receive compressive forces generated by the pad-to-pad [[Thumb#Opposition and apposition|opposition]] between the thumb and the index finger.  In contrast, in [[ape]]s, including fossil apes such as ''[[Dryopithecus]]'' and ''[[Proconsul (primate)|Proconsul]]'', these facets are oriented in a [[sagittal plane]]. In [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] monkeys these facets are oriented slightly differently due to their locomotor behaviour.

Interestingly, in ''[[Oreopithecus]]'', a [[Miocene]] hominid that went extinct {{mya|7}}, the orientation of the facet on the second metacarpal is similar to human conditions&nbsp;— an indication that it had the capability of pad-to-pad precision grip.  ''Oreopithecus'' also lacks the waisted capitate associated with apes and climbing still present in ''[[Australopithecus]]''.
