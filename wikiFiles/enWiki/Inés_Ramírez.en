'''Inés Ramírez Pérez''' (born 1960) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] woman from the state of [[Oaxaca]] who gained media attention after performing a successful [[Caesarean section]] on herself in 2000, making her the only person known to have done so successfully.

==History==
Ines Ramírez Pérez is a peasant living in rural [[Mexico]]. She speaks [[Zapotec languages|Zapotec]] and some [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref name="smh"/> She had no medical training, but nevertheless performed a successful Caesarean section on herself; both she and her baby survived.

Ramírez was alone in her cabin in [[Rio Talea]], Southern [[Mexico]], when her labour started.  The nearest [[midwife]] was more than 50 miles away over rough terrain and rough roads. Her husband, who had assisted her through her previous labours, was drinking at a cantina.  Rio Talea has 500 people and only one phone, but it was not nearby. Ramírez had given birth to eight children, seven living, at the time of the pregnancy in question. The last pregnancy, three years prior, had ended in fetal death during labor. Rather than experience the loss of another child in the same way, Ramírez decided to operate on herself.

===The operation===
At midnight, on 5 March 2000&#160;— after 12 hours of continual pain, Ramírez sat down on a bench<ref name="smh">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/01/1086037758224.html|title=True grit: the mum who delivered her own baby|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 June 2004|accessdate=4 November 2010}}</ref> and drank three small glasses of hard liquor.<ref name="ijgo">{{cite journal

(For comparison: a typical C-section incision is 10&nbsp;cm long, horizontal and well below the navel, the so-called "bikini-line incision".) After operating on herself for an hour, she reached inside her uterus and pulled out her baby boy.<ref name="smh"/> She then severed the umbilical cord with a pair of scissors and became unconscious.<ref name="smh"/> She used clothes to bandage her wound after regaining consciousness, and sent one of her older sons to find help.<ref name="smh"/>

===Aftermath===
Several hours later, the village health assistant and a second man found Ramírez conscious and alert, along with her live baby.<ref name="smh"/> He sewed her incision with an available needle and thread.<ref name="smh"/>

Ramírez was eventually taken to the local clinic, two and a half miles away, and then to the nearest hospital, eight hours away by car. Sixteen hours thereafter she underwent surgical repair of the incision site. On the seventh post-operative day, she underwent a second surgery to repair complications resulting from damage to her intestines incurred during her C-section. She was released from the hospital on the tenth day post-surgery, and went on to make a complete recovery.

Describing her experience, Ramírez said, "I couldn’t stand the pain anymore. If my baby was going to die, then I decided I would have to die, too. But if he was going to grow up, I was going to see him grow up, and I was going to be with my child. I thought that God would save both our lives."<ref name="smh"/>

Ramírez is believed to be the only person known to have performed a successful caesarean section on herself. Her case was written up in the March 2004 issue of the ''International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics''.<ref name="ijgo"/>

She is also believed to have been profoundly lucky in several ways: to have put herself in the position she chose, which put her uterus&#160;— rather than her intestines&#160;— against the abdominal wall under the incision site; to have not succumbed to infection from the large open wound in a non-sterile environment; to have not passed out from the pain part-way through, bled to death, or died from shock. She did say, afterward, that she didn't advise other women to follow her example.
