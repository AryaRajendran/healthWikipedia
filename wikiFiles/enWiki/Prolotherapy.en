'''Prolotherapy''' is also known as "proliferation therapy," "regenerative injection therapy,"<ref name="prolotherapy"/> or "proliferative injection therapy". It involves injecting an otherwise non-[[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] and non-[[Biological activity|active]] irritant solution into the body, generally in the region of [[tendons]] or [[ligaments]] for the purpose of strengthening weakened connective tissue and alleviating [[musculoskeletal]] pain.<ref>{{cite news| title= Injections to Kick-Start Tissue Repair | date= 7 August 2007  |quote= Prolotherapy involves a series of injections designed to produce inflammation in the injured tissue. |url =http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/health/07brod.html |publisher= [[New York Times]] | accessdate= 24 July 2008| first=Jane E.| last=Brody}}</ref><ref name="Wall Street"/><ref name="Mayo Clinic">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/prolotherapy/AN01330 |title=Prolotherapy: Solution to low back pain? |author=Brent A.

Prolotherapy is hypothesized to reinitiate the inflammatory process that deposits new additional fibers thereby repairing lax tendons or ligaments and to possibly promote the release of local growth factors.<ref name="review"/><ref name="Clinical"/> However, the precise [[mechanism of action]] remains unknown.<ref name="prolotherapy"/> Once strengthened, the weak areas would no longer send pain signals.<ref name="RationaleForProlotherapy">{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=AR |title=A Rationale for Prolotherapy|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Medicine |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages= |year=1991|url=http://www.prolotherapy.com/articles/banks.htm}}</ref> 
==History==
The concept of creating irritation or injury to stimulate healing has been recorded as early as Roman times where hot needles were poked into the shoulders of injured gladiators. Prolotherapy use began in the 1930s and was originally used in the treatment of ligamentous laxity.<ref name="review"/>  In the 1950s Dr. George S. Hackett, a general surgeon in the United States, began performing injections of irritant solutions in an effort to repair [[joints]] and hernias.<ref name="prolotherapy">{{cite journal |last1=Rabago |first1=D |last2=Slattengren |first2=A |last3=Zgierska |first3=A|title=Prolotherapy in Primary Care Practice|journal=Primary Care: Clinics in Office Practice |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=65–80 |year=2010|pmid=20188998|doi=10.1016/j.pop.2009.09.013}}</ref> This practice is what would eventually evolve into modern day prolotherapy. He was joined in this practice by [[Gustav Anders Hemwall]] in the 1950s.  In 1955, a Dr. Hemwall became acquainted with George Hackett at an [[American Medical Association]] meeting and started practicing prolotherapy.  Dr. Hemwall was regarded as an expert in prolotherapy.

==Prolotherapy in clinical practice==
Prolotherapy involves the injection of an irritant solution into a joint space, weakened ligament, or tendon insertion to relieve pain.<ref name="Clinical"/> Most commonly, hyperosmolar [[dextrose]] (a sugar) is the solution used;<ref name="Wall Street"/><ref name="Guided">{{Cite journal|last1=Davidson|first1=J|last2=Jayaraman|first2=S |title=Guided interventions in musculoskeletal ultrasound: what's the evidence?|journal=Clinical radiology |volume=66|issue=2 |pages=140-152 |year=2011|month=February|pmid=21216330 |doi=10.1016/j.crad.2010.09.006}}</ref> [[glycerine]], [[lidocaine]] (a commonly used [[local anesthetic]]),<ref name="Wall Street"/> [[phenol]], and sodium morrhuate, a derivative of [[cod liver oil]] extract are other commonly used agents.<ref name="review"/><ref name="Clinical"/> The injection is administered at joints or at tendons where they connect to bone. 

Prolotherapy treatment sessions are generally given every two to six weeks for several months.<ref name="prolotherapy"/> Many patients receive treatment at less frequent intervals until treatments are rarely required, if at all.<ref name="RationaleForProlotherapy"/>

==Possible indications for prolotherapy==
Indications for prolotherapy may include one or more of the following:<ref name="prolotherapy"/><ref name="Wall Street">{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304410504575560214236534310.html |title= A Pinch of Sugar for Pain|author=Laura Johannes |year=2010 |work= |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="UPMC"/>
* [[Low back pain]]
* Knee [[osteoarthritis]]
* [[Achilles tendinitis|Achilles tendinopathy]]<ref name="Clinical"/>
* [[Dislocated shoulder|Shoulder dislocation]]
* Neck strain
* [[Costochondritis]]
* [[Lateral epicondylitis]]
* [[Fibromyalgia]]
* Pain from [[whiplash injury]]
*[[Plantar fasciitis]]

==Contraindications==
[[Contraindications]] for patients to receive prolotherapy injections may include:<ref name="prolotherapy"/> 
* Local [[abscess]]
* [[Coagulopathy|Bleeding disorders]]<ref name="UPMC"/>
* Patient on [[anticoagulant]] medication<ref name="UPMC"/>
* Known allergy to prolotherapy agent<ref name="UPMC"/>
* Acute infections such as [[cellulitis]]<ref name="Clinical"/>
* [[Septic arthritis]]<ref name="Clinical"/>
Relative contraindications include:
* Acute [[gouty arthritis]]
* Acute [[bone fracture|fracture]]

==Side effects and Adverse events==
Patients receiving prolotherapy injections have reported generally mild side effects including: pain at the injection site<ref name="Wall Street"/> (often within 72 hours of the injection), numbness at the injection site, or mild bleeding. Pain from prolotherapy injections is temporary and is often treated with [[acetaminophen]] or in rare cases [[opioid]] medications; [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]] are not usually recommended but are occasionally used in patients with pain refractory to other methods of [[Pain management|pain control]].<ref name="prolotherapy"/> Theoretical adverse events of prolotherapy injection include [[lightheadedness]], allergic reactions to the agent used, infection, or [[nerve injury|nerve damage]]. However, [[allergic reactions]] to sodium morrhuate are rare.<ref name="prolotherapy"/> Rare cases of back pain, neck pain, spinal cord irritation, [[pneumothorax]], and disc injury have been reported at a rate comparable to that of other spinal injection procedures.<ref name="prolotherapy"/><ref name="Clinical"/>

==Evidence based medicine==

A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane review]] of the medical literature as of October 2006 on the efficacy of prolotherapy injections in adults with chronic low-back pain concluded:<ref name="CochraneCollaboration">{{cite journal |last1=Dagenais |first1=S |last2=Yelland |first2=MJ |last3=Del Mar |first3=C|last4=Schoene|first4=ML|title=Prolotherapy injections for chronic low-back pain|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews |volume=CD004059 |issue= |pages= |year=2007|month=April|pmid=17443537|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004059.pub3}}</ref>

Three [[randomized controlled trials]] found that prolotherapy by itself is inadequate for chronic low-back pain, but can be beneficial when used with other low back pain treatment modalities such as [[spinal manipulation]] or corticosteroid injections.<ref name="Clinical">{{cite journal |last1=Distel |first1=LM|last2=Best|first2=TM|title=Prolotherapy: a clinical review of its role in treating chronic musculoskeletal pain|journal=PM&R |volume=3 |issue=6 supplement 1 |pages=S78-S81 |year=2011|month=June|pmid=21703585|doi=10.1016/j.pmrj.2011.04.003}}</ref><ref name="CochraneCollaboration"/> These studies, however were based on treating non specific back pain, not the indicated tendonosis. They also were not provided in locations specific for the patient's pathology but rather at predetermined points.
{{quotation|Of the five studies we reviewed, three found that prolotherapy injections alone were not an effective treatment for chronic low-back pain and two found that a combination of prolotherapy injections, spinal manipulation, exercises, and other treatments can help chronic low-back pain and disability. Minor side effects such as increased back pain and stiffness were common but short-lived. Based on these five studies, the role of prolotherapy injections for chronic low-back pain is still not clear.}}

More recently, a 2009 [[systematic review]] of the medical literature evaluated the efficacy of injection therapies including prolotherapy in the treatment of lateral epicondylosis. The authors concluded that the current body of evidence for prolotherapy and other injection therapies suggests that these therapies may benefit patients with lateral epicondylosis, but could not make definitive conclusions due to the limited evidence available.<ref name="review">{{cite journal |last1=Rabago |first1=D |last2=Best |first2=TM |last3=Zgierska |first3=AE|last4=Zelsig|first4=E|last5=Ryan|first5=M|last6=Crane|first6=D |title=A systematic review of four injections therapies for lateral epicondylosis: prolotherapy, polidocanol, whole blood, and platelet-rich plasma|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=471–481 |year=2009|pmid=19028733|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2008.052761}}</ref> A 2010 systematic review concluded moderate evidence exists to support the use of prolotherapy injections in the management of pain in lateral epicondyalgia; the authors also concluded that prolotherapy was no more effective than eccentric exercise in the treatment of achilles tendinopathy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coombes|first1=BK |last2=Bisset |first2=L |last3=Vicenzino |first3=B|title=Efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections and other injections for management of tendinopathy: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials|journal=Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9754 |pages=1751-1767 |year=2010|month=November|pmid=20970844|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61160-9}}</ref>   

Again in 2012, a systematic review and [[meta-analysis]] of seventeen trials studying various injection therapies including [[glucocorticoids]], [[botulinum toxin]], [[Autologous blood injection|autologous blood]], [[platelet-rich plasma]], [[polidocanol]], [[glycosaminoglycan]], prolotherapy, and [[hyaluronic acid]] found that prolotherapy and hyaluronic acid injection therapies were more efficacious than placebo when treating lateral epicondylosis. Of the studies evaluated, one of ten glucocorticoid trials, one of five trials for autologous blood or platelet-rich plasma, one trial of polidcanol, and one trial of prolotherapy met the criteria for low risk of bias.  The authors noted that few of the reviewed trials met the criteria for low risk of bias and that there is a need for more well-controlled trials.<ref name="meta-analysis">{{cite journal |last1=Krogh |first1=TP |last2=Bartels |first2=EM |last3=Ellingsen |first3=T|last4=Stengaard-Pedersen|first4=K|last5=Buchbinder|first5=R|last6=Fredberg|first6=U|last7=Bliddal|first7=H|last8=Christensen|first8=R |title=Comparative Effectiveness  of Injection Therapies in Lateral Epicondylitis: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials |journal=American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume= |issue=7 |pages= |year=2012|month=September|pmid=22972856|doi=10.1177/0363546512458237}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Major [[medical insurance]] policies do not currently cover the treatment. The [[Medicare (United States)|United States Medicare]] system does not cover prolotherapy <!-- "... the medical effectiveness of these therapies has not been verified by scientifically controlled studies, and therefore, cannot be covered..."--> despite reviews of the policy which took place in September 1992 and September 1999, after practitioners demanded them. The reviewers determined that practitioners had not provided "any scientific evidence on which to base a [different] coverage decision," and so retained Medicare's current coverage policy, but expressed willingness to reconsider if presented with results of "further studies on the benefits of prolotherapy."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/prolo.html |title=HCFA Decision Memorandum |accessdate=24 July 2008 |quote= |publisher=Quackwatch}}</ref>
Medicare in 1999 failed to review any new available literature regarding prolotherapy; they based their decision solely on the result of their prior decision.

Veteran Affairs and workman's compensation now cover prolotherapy.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
