A '''nutrient enema''', also known as '''feeding per rectum''', '''rectal alimentation''', or '''rectal feeding''', is an [[enema]] administered with the intent of providing [[nutrition]] when normal [[eating]] is not possible. Although this treatment is ancient, dating back at least to [[Galen]], and commonly used in the Middle Ages,<ref>{{cite jstor|25302025}}</ref> and still a common technique in 19th century medicine,<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1987791|title=The nutrient enema|author=J. W. A. Mackenzie|date=March 1943|publisher=Archives of Disease in Childhood|pmid=21032242|volume=18|issue=93|journal=Arch. Dis. Child.|pages=22â€“7}}</ref> Nutrient enemas have been superseded in modern medical care by [[tube feeding]] and [[intravenous feeding]].

A variety of different mixes have been used for nutrient enemas throughout history. A paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1926 stated that because the [[rectum]] and lower [[digestive tract]] lack [[digestive enzyme]]s, it is likely that only the end-products of normal digestion such as [[sugars]], [[amino acid]]s, [[salt]] and [[alcohol]], will be absorbed.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/118858a0}}</ref>

Notoriously, the treatment was given to U.S. President [[James A. Garfield]] after his shooting in 1881, and is asserted to have prolonged his life.<ref>Bliss, D. W.
