A '''staphyloma''' is an abnormal protrusion of the [[uvea]]l tissue through a weak point in the [[human eye|eyeball]]. The protrusion is generally black in colour, due to the inner layers of the [[human eye|eye]]. It occurs due to weakening of outer layer of eye (cornea or sclera) by an inflammatory or degenerative condition. 
It may be of 5 types, depending on the location on the [[human eye|eye ball]] (''bulbus oculi'').

== Anterior (corneal) staphyloma ==
In the [[anterior segment]] of the eye, involving the [[cornea]] and the nearby [[sclera]].

== Intercalary staphyloma ==
It is the name given to the localised bulge in limbal area, lined by the root of the iris. It results due to ectasia of weak scar tissue formed at the limbus, following healing of a perforating injury or a peripheral corneal ulcer. There may be associated secondary angle closure glaucoma,  may cause progression of the bulge if not treated. Defective vision occurs due to marked corneal astigmatism. Treatment consists of localised staphylectomy under heavy doses of oral steroids.

== Ciliary staphyloma ==

As the name implies, it is the bulge of weak sclera lined by ciliary body, which occurs about 2–3&nbsp;mm away from the limbus. Its common causes are thinning of sclera following perforating injury, scleritis & absolute glaucoma.

== Equatorial staphyloma ==
On the equator of the eye (region circumferencing the largest diameter orthogonal to the visual axis). Its causes are scleritis & degeneration of sclera in pathological myopia. It occurs more commonly in the regions of sclera which are perforated by vortex veins.

== Posterior staphyloma ==
In the [[posterior segment]] of the eye, typically diagnosed at the region of the [[macula]], deforming the eye in a way that the eye-length is extended associated with [[myopia]] (nearsightedness). It is diagnosed by ophthalmoscopy, which shows an area of retinal excavation in the region of the staphyloma.
