A '''case-control study''' is a type of [[study design]] used widely, often in [[epidemiology]]. It is a type of [[observational study]] in which two existing groups differing in outcome are identified and compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute. Case-control studies are often used to identify factors that may contribute to a medical condition by comparing subjects who have that condition/disease (the 'cases') with patients who do not have the condition/disease but are otherwise similar (the 'controls').<ref name="url8. Case-control and cross sectional studies">{{cite web |url=http://emj.bmj.com/content/20/1/54.full.pdf |title=8. Case-control and cross sectional studies |format= |work= |accessdate=March 5, 2012}}

==Definition==
The case-control is a type of epidemiological observational study. An observational study is a study in which subjects are not randomized to the exposed or unexposed groups, rather the subjects are ''observed'' in order to determine both their exposure and their outcome status and the exposure status is thus not determined by the researcher. 
Porta's Dictionary of Epidemiology<ref name="Porta's Dictionary of Epidemiology">Porta M (editor). A dictionary of epidemiology. 5th. edition. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Edited by [[Miquel Porta]] [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/EpidemiologyBiostatistics/?view=usa&ci=9780195314502]</ref> defines the case-control study as

: an observational epidemiological study of persons with the disease (or another outcome variable) of interest and a suitable control group of persons without the disease (comparison group, reference group). The potential relationship of a suspected risk factor or an attribute to the disease is examined by comparing the diseased and nondiseased subjects with regard to how frequently the factor or attribute is present (or, if quantitative, the levels of the attribute) in each of the groups (diseased and nondiseased)."<ref name="Porta's Dictionary of Epidemiology" /> 

For example, in a study trying to show that people who smoke (the ''attribute'') are more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer (the ''outcome''), the ''cases'' would be persons with lung cancer, the ''controls'' would be persons without lung cancer (not necessarily healthy), and some of each group would be smokers. If a larger proportion of the cases smoke than the controls, that suggests, but does not conclusively show, that the hypothesis is valid.

The case-control study is frequently contrasted with [[cohort study|cohort studies]], wherein exposed and unexposed subjects are observed until they develop an outcome of interest.<ref name="Porta's Dictionary of Epidemiology" /><ref name="Rothman K.

=== Control group selection ===

Controls need not be in good health; inclusion of sick people is sometimes appropriate, as the control group should represent those at risk of becoming a case.<ref>Compared to what? Finding controls for case-control studies, David A Grimes, Kenneth F Schulz, Lancet 2005; 365: 1429–33</ref> Controls should come from the same population as the cases, and their selection should be independent of the exposures of interest.<ref>Case-control studies: research in reverse; Kenneth F Schulz, David A Grimes. Lancet 2002: 359: 431–34</ref>

Controls can carry the same disease as the experimental group, but of another grade/severity, therefore being different from the outcome of interest. However, because the difference between the cases and the controls will be smaller, this results in a lower [[statistical power|power]] to detect an exposure effect.

As with any epidemiological study, greater numbers in the study will increase the power of the study. Numbers of cases and controls do not have to be equal. In many situations, it is much easier to recruit controls than to find cases. Increasing the number of controls above the number of cases, up to a ratio of about 4 to 1, may be a cost-effective way to improve the study.<ref>Grimes D.A., Schulz K.F. Compared to what? Finding controls for case-control studies. Lancet 2005; 365: 1429–33</ref>

==Usefulness and drawbacks==
Case-control studies are a relatively inexpensive and frequently used type of epidemiological study that can be carried out by small teams or individual researchers in single facilities in a way that more structured experimental studies often cannot be.  They have pointed the way to a number of important discoveries and advances. The case-control study design is often used in the study of rare diseases or as a preliminary study where little is known about the association  between the risk factor and disease of interest.<ref>Kate Ann Levin, Study design I, Evidence-Based Dentistry (2005) 6, 78–79. doi:10.1038/sj.ebd.6400355 </ref>

Compared to prospective cohort studies they tend to be less costly and shorter in duration. In several situations they have greater statistical power than cohort studies, which must often wait for a 'sufficient' number of disease events to accrue. 

Case-control studies are observational in nature and thus do not provide the same level of evidence as [[randomized controlled trials]]. The results may be confounded by other factors, to the extent of giving the opposite answer to better studies. A meta-analysis of what were considered 30 high-quality studies concluded that use of a product halved a risk, when in fact the risk was, if anything, increased.<ref>[http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/3/464.short Lawlor, D. A., G. Davey Smith, and S. Ebrahim. 2004. Commentary: The hormone replacement-coronary heart disease conundrum: is this the death of observational epidemiology? Int. J. Epidemiol. 33: 464-467.]</ref><ref>[http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/294/2/218.short Ioannidis, J. P. A. 2005. Contradicted and initially stronger effects in highly cited clinical research. JAMA 294: 218-228.]</ref> It may also be more difficult to establish the timeline of exposure to disease outcome in the setting of a case-control study than within a prospective cohort study design where the exposure is ascertained prior to following the subjects over time in order to ascertain their outcome status. The most important drawback in case-control studies relates to the difficulty of obtaining reliable information about an individual’s exposure status over time. Case-control studies are therefore placed low in the [[hierarchy of evidence]].

==Examples==
One of the most significant triumphs of the case-control study was the demonstration of the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer, by Sir Richard Doll and others after him. Doll was able to show a statistically significant association between the two in a large case-control study.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3826939.stm Sir Richard Doll: A life's research]", [[BBC News]], 22 June 2004</ref>  Opponents argued for many years that this type of study cannot prove causation, but the eventual results of cohort studies confirmed the causal link which the case-control studies suggested, and it is now accepted that tobacco smoking is the cause of about 87% of all lung cancer mortality in the US.

==Analysis==
Case-control studies were initially analyzed by testing whether or not there were significant differences between the proportion of exposed subjects among cases and controls.<ref name="Rodrigues L, Kirkwood BR.

Jerome Cornfield’s contributions to epidemiology. Biometrics 1982; 38:33-45. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2529852?seq=1]</ref> pointed out that, when the disease outcome of interest is rare, the odds ratio of exposure can be used to estimate the relative risk (see [[rare disease assumption]]). It was later shown by Miettinen in 1976 that this assumption is not necessary and that the odds ratio of exposure can be used to directly estimate the incidence rate ratio of exposure without the need for the rare disease assumption.<ref name="Rodrigues L, Kirkwood BR.
