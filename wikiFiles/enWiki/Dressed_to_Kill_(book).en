'''''Dressed to Kill''''' is a book by Sydney Ross Singer and Soma Grismaijer that proposes a link between [[Brassiere|bra]]s and [[breast cancer]].  According to the authors, the restrictive nature of a brassiere inhibits the [[lymphatic system]]. The book's claim that bras cause breast cancer has been dismissed by the medical and scientific communities; the [[National Cancer Institute]],<ref name="nci">[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/pregnancy Fact Sheet on Breast Cancer Risk Factors], from the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]]. Accessed July 10, 2008.</ref> the [[American Cancer Society]],<ref name="acs">[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MED/content/MED_6_1x_Underwire_Bras.asp?sitearea=MED Bras and Breast Cancer], from the [[American Cancer Society]]. Accessed July 10, 2008.</ref> and the [[National Institutes of Health]]<ref name="nih">[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000913.htm Breast Cancer Information] from [[MedlinePlus]]. Accessed July 10, 2008.</ref> have all concluded that there is no link between bra use and breast cancer.

== Background ==
In their book, Singer and Grismaijer argue that bra-wearing may be a major cause of [[breast cancer]] because of the purported effect of the bra on lymphatic circulation. Their interpretation is that constriction from tightly worn bras inhibits the proper functioning of the [[lymphatic system]] and leads to a buildup of fluid within the breast tissue.  In addition, they state [[carcinogenic]] substances that we take into our bodies through [[petrochemical]]ly polluted food, air and water course throughout the body, including the breast tissue, and need to be flushed from the tissues by the lymphatic system.  Hence, bra-induced constriction of the breast lymphatic vessels, according to the authors, concentrates these toxins within the breast tissue, which may ultimately lead to cancer.

Singer and Grismaijer claim 70% of breast cancer cases are unexplainable by the then-current [as of 1995] [[Epidemiology and etiology of breast cancer|known risk factors for breast cancer]]. In addition, the authors claim that breast cancer is only a problem in cultures where women wear bras; in bra-free cultures, breast cancer is a rare event.  In ''Dressed To Kill'', they argue that women who wear a bra 24 hours a day are 125 times more likely to have breast cancer than women who are bra-free.  Their study also claims that bra-free women have about the same incidence of breast cancer as men.

Singer and Grismaijer claim to have noticed that the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]], who are integrated into white culture and therefore wear bras, have the same rate of breast cancer, while the [[Australian Aborigines|aboriginals]] of [[Australia]], who are bra-free, have practically no breast cancer. The same was true for “Westernized” [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Fijians]] and other bra-converted cultures.

Singer and Grismaijer examined the bra wearing attitudes and behaviors of over 4,700 US women in 5 major cities.  They claim about half of the women questioned had had breast cancer. Women who had had breast cancer were asked about their bra-wearing habits prior to their diagnosis of cancer.  Although they did not adhere to any [[scientific protocol]]s for a medical study, the authors hoped that the medical industry would follow-up with further research to either verify or refute their findings.  Their study findings were:

* 3 out of 4 women who wore their bras 24 hours per day developed breast cancer.
* 1 out of 7 women who wore bras more than 12 hour per day but not to bed developed breast cancer.
* 1 out of 152 women who wore their bras less than 12 hours per day got breast cancer.
* 1 out of 168 women who wore bras rarely or never acquired breast cancer.

The authors published these claims in ''Dressed to Kill''. The book generated controversy which the authors attributed the greed of the fashion and medical industries: "The bra industry is a multi-billion dollar enterprise. And billions of dollars are spent each year researching and treating this disease.  Ironically, ending breast cancer can cause financial hardship for many people." <ref>{{cite web | last=Singer | first=Sydney Ross | url=http://www.theherbaladvisor.com/Healthy_Living_35/Bras_Still_Cause_Breast_Cancer_Are_Your_Patients_Dressed_To_Kill.shtml | title= Bras Still Cause Breast Cancer: Are Your Patients Dressed To Kill? | year=2007 | publisher= The Herbal Advisor.com | accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref>

To dismiss critics of their work, they claim the mainstream medical organizations all denied the link between smoking and [[lung cancer]] for decades after the initial research was published.<ref>

== Criticisms ==
Medical and scientific bodies which have examined the book's claims have generally dismissed them on the basis of poor methodology, lack of supporting evidence, and Singer and Grismaijer's failure to consider alternate explanations besides bra use for their findings.

One specific critique of the their book by Martha Molete of the Cancer Association of South Africa argues that numerous aspects of the book's claims are scientifically unsubstantiated or unproven, citing:<ref name="Molete">{{cite web | last=Molete | first=Martha | url=https://www.givengain.com/cgi-bin/giga.cgi?cmd=cause_dir_news_item&cause_id=1056&news_id=31903&cat_id=756 | title=Can wearing a bra cause breast cancer? | year=2008 | publisher= [[Cancer Society of South Africa]] | accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref>

# Lack of controlled epidemiological data correlating bra-wearing with the risk for breast cancer
# Lack of proof that the pressure exerted by a bra reduces the flow of lymph
# Lack of proof that lymph contains carcinogens
# Lack of proof that there are carcinogens in the human body that can induce breast cancer
# Existence of published data correlating obesity with post-menopausal breast cancer 

None of the authors' surveys have attempted to account for any of the [[Epidemiology and etiology of breast cancer|well-known epidemiological risk factors for breast cancer]], such as number of full-term pregnancies, age at first pregnancy, obesity, [[Western pattern diet]], or use of [[medication]]s such as [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]].  Per Molete, "the authors' statistical treatment of their obtained data appears to be flawed. They do not include the data or a detailed description of the statistical treatment of the data. The two groups, i.e. those wearing bras and those that did not, were not controlled for many other factors influencing the risk of breast cancer."<ref name="Molete"/>

=== No supporting research ===
A survey of the [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] database revealed no published scientific studies supporting a link between bra wearing and breast cancer risk.<ref name="Molete"/>  Furthermore, no scientific publications were found which were authored by Singer or Grismaijer.<ref name="Molete"/>

=== Scientific counterhypothesis ===
The Molete article also discusses the one scientific study that examined the relationship between breast cancer and bra use. This study, among 3,918 cases and 11,712 controls from 7 centers in the United States, found that premenopausal women who do not wear bras had half the risk of breast cancer compared with bra users (P about 0.09). The authors offer the hypothesis that women who do not wear bras are thinner and likely to have smaller breasts. The same study found that among postmenopausal women only bra users with larger breasts had an increased risk of breast cancer (P about 0.026). The study suggests bra cup size is a proxy for greater weight and obesity which are known risk factors for breast cancer, and that the apparent risk associated with bra use is more likely a reflection of known risk factors for breast cancer, such as obesity.<ref name="Molete"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hsieh CC  |first=Trichopoulos D  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |month= |title=Breast size, handedness and breast cancer risk |journal=European Journal of Cancer and Clinical Oncology |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=131–134 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1016/0277-5379(91)90469-T |last2=Trichopoulos |first2=D. |pmid=1827274}}</ref>

===Opposing views===
Other medical and scientific bodies uniformly reject the book's claims about bras and breast cancer:

* The [[National Cancer Institute]] (US) states that bras have not been shown to increase a woman's risk of breast cancer.<ref name="acs"/> 
* Breastcancer.org specifically answers this question, relating to bras and how breasts are touched.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breastcancer.org/questions/bras.jsp |title=Can Wearing a Bra all the Time Cause Cancer? |publisher=Breastcancer.org |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>
* The [[American Cancer Society]] states, "There are no scientifically valid studies that show wearing bras of any type causes breast cancer."<ref name="acs"/>
* The U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] states, "Breast implants, using antiperspirants, and wearing [[underwire bra]]s do not raise your risk for breast cancer."<ref name="nih"/>
* In 2000, as a follow-up to misreporting of a UK study, British health professionals and "Cancer charities" stated that bras cause no increase in breast cancer risk.<ref>{{cite news | last= | first= | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/998348.stm | title=Claims of bra link to cancer dismissed | publisher=BBC | accessdate=2009-01-01 | date=2000-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Stuart | first=Julia | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/dont-burn-your-bra-just-yet-622008.html | title=Don't burn your bra just yet | publisher=[[The Independent]] | accessdate=2009-01-01 | location=London | date=2000-11-02}}</ref>
