A '''general practitioner''' ('''GP''') is a [[Physician|medical practitioner]] who treats [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] and [[Chronic (medical)|chronic illnesses]] and provides [[preventive care]] and [[health education]] to patients. "The good GP will treat patients both as people and as a population".<ref>Ann Leck and Ian Leck (1987), What is a good GP?, [[British Medical Journal]], 294 (6568), 351-2.</ref> 

As a difference to medical or surgical specialized doctors they intend to practice a [[Holism|holistic]] approach that takes into consideration the biological, psychological and social environment in which patients live. Their duties are not confined to specific organs of the body, and they have particular skills in treating people with multiple health issues. They are trained to treat patients of any age and sex to levels of complexity that are defined by each country.<ref>http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_Duties_of_a_family_practitioner</ref>

In some healthcare systems GPs work in primary care healthcare centres where they  play a central role in the healthcare team  Nevertheless,  in some models of care GPs work as single-handed practitioners. 

The variations in the role of a GP vary greatly between countries or even within countries. In urban areas of developed countries their roles are much narrower and focused on the care of chronic health problems, treatment of acute non-life threatening diseases, early detection and referral to specialized care of serious diseases and preventative care as health education or immunization. Meanwhile, in rural areas of developed countries or in developing countries a GP may be routinely involved in pre-hospital emergency care, the delivery of babies, some hospital care in community hospitals and perform low complexity surgical procedures. <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2845490/</ref><ref>http://www.stfm.org/fmhub/fm2008/April/Bill284.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.amazon.co.uk/Confessions-GP-Benjamin-Daniels/dp/1906321884</ref>

The term ''general practitioner'' or ''GP'' is common in the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]] and several [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. In these countries the word [[physician]] is largely reserved for certain other types of medical specialists, notably in [[internal medicine]]. While in these countries, the term GP has a clearly defined meaning, in North America the term has become somewhat ambiguous, and is not necessarily synonymous with the term "[[Family medicine|family doctor]]" or primary care provider, as described below.

While historically the role of a GP has been performed from any doctor qualified in a medical school working in the community. Since the 1950s general practice has become a speciality in its own right, with specific training requirements tailored to each country. <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2370185/?page=1</ref><ref>http://personal.rhul.ac.uk/usjd/135/indexgp.htm</ref><ref>http://ino.sagepub.com/content/2/1/2.full</ref>

The [[Alma Ata Declaration]] in 1978 set the intellectual foundation of what primary care and general practice is now days.

=== India and Bangladesh ===
The basic medical degrees in India and Bangladesh are MBBS ([[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]]), BAMS ([[Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery]]), BHMS ([[Bachelor of Homoeopathic Medicine and Surgery]]) and BUMS (Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery). These generally comprise of a four-and-a-half-year course followed by a year of compulsory rotatory internship. The internship requires the candidate to work in all departments for a stipulated period of time, to undergo hands-on training in treating patients.

The registration of doctors is usually managed by state medical councils. A permanent registration as a Registered Medical Practitioner is granted only after satisfactory completion of the compulsory internship.

=== Pakistan ===
In [[Pakistan]], formerly a part of undivided [[British India]], 5 years of MBBS is followed by one year of internship in different specialties. [[Pakistan Medical and Dental Council]] (PMDC) then confers permanent registration, after which the candidate may choose to practice as a GP or opt for specialty training.

The first Family Medicine Training programme was approved by the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Pakistan (CPSP) in 1992
and initiated in 1993 by the Family Medicine Division of the Department of Community Health
Sciences, [[Aga Khan University]], Pakistan. In 1997, the Royal College of General Practitioners, UK, unconditionally approved the Programme for the MRCGP Examination and additionally declared it as amongst the top 10 programmes in UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aku.edu/pgme/pdfs/fammed.pdf |title= Family Medicine |publisher=Aga Khan University|work= |accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref>

=== France ===
In [[France]], the '''''médecin généraliste''''' (commonly called ''docteur'') is responsible for the long term care in a population. This implies prevention, education, care of the [[disease]]s and [[Physical trauma|trauma]]s that do not require a specialist, and orientation towards a specialist when necessary. They also follow the severe diseases day-to-day (between the acute crises that require the intervention of a specialist).

They have a role in the survey of [[epidemy|epidemics]], a legal role (constatation of traumas that can bring compensation, certificates for the practice of a [[sport]], [[death]] certificate, certificate for hospitalisation without consent in case of mental incapacity), and a role in the [[emergency medicine|emergency care]] (they can be called by the ''samu'', the French [[emergency medical service|EMS]]). They often go to a patient's home when the patient cannot come to the consulting room (especially in case of children or old people), and have to contribute to a night and week-end duty (although this was contested in a strike in 2002). {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The studies consist of six years in the university (common to all medical specialties), and three years as a junior practitioner (''interne'')&nbsp;:
* the first year (PACES, ''première année commune aux études de santé'', often abbreviated to ''P1'' by students) is common with the dentists and [[midwifery]]; the rank at the final competitive examination<ref>Marchand-Antonin, Benoît.

* the following two years, called ''propédeutique'', are dedicated to the fundamental sciences: [[anatomy]], human [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]], [[bacteriology]], [[statistics]]...
* the three following years are called ''externat'' and are dedicated to the study of [[clinical medicine]]; they end with a classifying examination, the rank determines in which specialty (general medicine is one of them) the student can make his ''internat'';
* the ''internat'' is three years of initial professional experience under the responsibility of a ''senior''; the ''interne'' can prescribe, he can replace physicians,<ref>Guedes-Marchand, Cécile.

This ends with a [[doctorate]], a research work which usually consist of a statistical study of cases to propose a care strategy for a specific affliction (in an epidemiological, diagnostic, or therapeutic point of view).

=== Czech Republic ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
In Czech Republic to become a general practitioner five years of training are required, either as GP for adults (''praktické lékařství pro dospělé'') or for children and adolescents (''praktické lékařství pro děti a dorostv''). In Czech Republic the subcject practical medicine (''praktické lékařství'') is divided into three subgroups:

001 - praktické lékařství pro dospělé (GP for adults)

002 - praktické lékařství pro děti a dorost (GP for children and adolescents)

003 - lékařská služba první pomoci (first aid medicine)

Czech GPs either work in their own office or in health centers.

=== Germany ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
In Germany most general practitioners are ''Fachärzte für Allgemeinmedizin'' (''specialists of common medicine''), some are ''hausärztliche Internisten'' (''specialists of internal medicine''). To become a general practitioner either 5 years of training in ''Allgemeinmedizin'' (''common medicine'') or ''Innere Medizin'' (''internal medicine'') are required. For ''Facharzt für Allgemeinmedizin'' training time in internal medicine, surgery and in general practice is required. Most general practitioners work in their own office, sometimes together with colleagues in health centers, regionally associated in ''Kassenärztliche Vereinigungen'' (''Associations of practitioners in public health system''). Patients can use a on-call service at night and during the weekends. Many regions have to face a shortage of general practitioners, especially in rural areas.

=== Ireland ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
General Practice in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] largely follows the British model, with some exceptions. GP training in Ireland is governed by the [[Irish College of General Practitioners]] and requires the completion of a primary medical degree. In Ireland the title of MB BCh BAO (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery, Bachelor of the Obstetric Art) or BM BS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) is awarded upon successful completion of a 4 year graduate or 5 to 6 year undergraduate degree programme in one of the country's 6 medical schools.

Following this a further year is spent as an Intern, rotating through medical and surgical specialties. In most, but not all instances, 6 months are spent in medicine and 6 months in surgery. Some interns can gain experience in general practice, psychiatry and other specialties. The successful completion of intern training leads to full registration with the Irish Medical Council.

Those [[physician|medical practitioners]] wishing to pursue a career in General Practice must complete an approved training scheme. Previously completion of a training scheme was not mandatory to sit the Membership of the Irish College of General Practictioners (MICGP) exams and practice as a GP in Ireland. Many doctors took up stand-alone SHO posts in the required specialities and then sat the exam without any vocational training. This route has now been abolished and vocational training is mandatory. Completion of vocational GP training in other jurisdictions (e.g. the UK) and completion of the MICGP or equivalent (e.g. MRCGP) is still possible, but anecdotal evidence would suggest Irish trained GPs are at a significant advantage when applying for Irish GP posts.

Entry to a General Practice Training Scheme is based on competitive interview. Most are of 4 years duration (one is 5 years). Generally the first 2 years are spent rotating through relevant specialties (medicine, paediatrics, obstetrics & gynaecology, psychiatry, accident & emergency, ENT etc.). Two years are then spent as a GP registrar in designated Training Practice. After successfully completing the MICGP exams, the new general practitioner is free to practice.

General practice in Ireland is a desirable career for many and competition for places on training schemes is intense. There has been much criticism of the perceived under-supply of training places and efforts are made to increase places annually. Currently there are 12 schemes - Donegal, Sligo, Western (Galway, Mayo and Roscommon), Mid-Western (Limerick, Clare and Tipperary North Riding), Southern (Cork & Kerry), South-East (Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and Tipperary South Riding), Midlands (Offaly, Westmeath, Laois, Kildare), North-East (Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Cavan), Ballinasloe and 3 schemes based in Dublin.

Typically Irish GPs work exclusively with private (i.e. fee-for-service paying) patients or have a mix of public and private. So-called "public" patients are those who qualify for a medical card under the General Medical Services (or GMS) system. This is free health care, provided by the government and is means tested. Other groups such as those with specified chronic illnesses and the elderly are also entitled to a medical card. A medical card entitles the holder to free GP consultations, free medications and free hospital treatment.
In order to treat medical card holders a GP must apply for and be granted a GMS list. Applications for such lists are competitive as they can be very lucurative for the GP and vacancies do not often arise.

GPs deal with the entire spectrum of medical ailments. They are well placed to implement preventative measures and to manage chronic illness. They also act as "gate-keepers" for the tertiary care system, providing referrals to specialist services when appropriate. Some GPs are employed by private agencies.

=== Italy ===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
In [[Italy]] the '''''medico di famiglia''''', or "medico di medicina generale", is the first point of contact between patient and healthcare system.  The equivalent figure in the UK and in most English-speaking countries is the General Practitioner. The "medico di famiglia" is a self-employed worker, but he has contractual arrangements with the NHS.
As a result of Title IV of D. Decree 368/99, as amended by Legislative Decree 277/03. It is imposed as a prerequisite for new GPs the "Diploma di Formazione Specifica in Medicina Generale" (Diploma of Specific Training in General Medicine) necessary for working as general practitioners under the National Health Service. For doctors graduated after 31.12.1994 the possession of this diploma is a necessary requirement for accessing to the regional ranking of general practice aimed to access agreements with the NHS as a General Practitioner.
Not only citizens but also treated and non-Europeans living legally are entitled to the choice of general practitioner.
The choice can be achieved within the municipality of residence or domicile in health.
To become a "medico di famiglia " you must hold a Degree in Medicine and Surgery (6 years course), authorization to practice as a Physician, the inclusion in the doctors' register, the diploma of specialization in general medicine (3 years Residency Program), and the inclusion in the regional rankings.

=== Netherlands and Belgium ===
General practice in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] is considered fairly advanced. The ''huisarts'' (literally: "home doctor") administers first line, primary care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In the Netherlands, patients cannot consult a hospital specialist without a required referral. Most GP's work in private practice although more medical centers with employed GP's are seen. Many GP's have a specialist interest, e.g. in [[palliative care]].

In Belgium, one year of lectures and two years of [[residency (medicine)|residency]] are required. In the Netherlands, training consists of three years (full-time) of specialization after completion of internships. First and third year of training takes place at a GP practice. The second year of training consists of six months training at an emergency room, or internal medicine, paediatrics or gynaecology, or a combination of a general or academic hospital, three months of training at a psychiatric hospital or outpatient clinic and three months at a nursing home (verpleeghuis) or clinical geriatrics ward/policlinic. During all three years, residents get one day of training at university while working in practice the other days. The first year, a lot of emphasis is placed on communications skills with video training. Furthermore all aspects of working as a GP gets addressed including working with the medical standards from the Dutch GP association NHG (Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nhg.artsennet.nl/kenniscentrum/k_richtlijnen/k_nhgstandaarden.htm |title=NHG-Standaarden |publisher=Nhg.artsennet.nl |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>
All residents must also take the national GP knowledge test (Landelijke Huisartsgeneeskundige Kennistoets (LHK-toets)) twice a year.<ref name="huisartsopleiding.nl">{{cite web|url=http://huisartsopleiding.nl/content.asp?kid=10072029&bid=10028521 |title=Huisartsopleiding Nederland - LHK-toets |publisher=Huisartsopleiding.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref> In this test of 120 multiple choice questions, medical, ethical, scientific and legal matters of GP work are addressed.<ref name="huisartsopleiding.nl"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://knmg.artsennet.nl/Opleiding-en-Registratie/opleiding/hvrc.htm |title=Opleiding tot huisarts |publisher=Knmg.artsennet.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>

=== Spain ===
[[File:DivinoValles.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Francisco Vallés]] (Divino Vallés)]]
In [[Spain]] GPs are officially '''especialistas en medicina familiar y comunitaria''' but are commonly called "''médico de cabecera''" or "''médico de familia''." <ref>http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicina_familiar_y_comunitaria</ref>

Most Spanish GPs work for the state funded health authority through the regional government (''comunidad autónoma''). They are in most cases salary-based healthcare workers. 

For the provision of primary care, Spain is currently divided geographically in basic health care areas (''áreas básicas de salud''), each one containing a primary health care team (''Equipo de atención primaria''). Each team is multidisciplinary and typically includes GPs, community pediatricians, nurses, physiotherapists and social workers, together with ancillary staff. In urban areas all the services are concentrated in a single large building (Centro de salud) while in rural areas the main center is supported by smaller branches (''consultorios''), typically single-handled. <ref>http://www.msc.es/ciudadanos/prestaciones/centrosServiciosSNS/hospitales/introduccionCentro.htm</ref>

Becoming a GP in Spain involves studying medicine for 6 years, passing a competitive national exam called MIR (''Medico Interno Residente'') and undergoing a 4 years training program. The training program has includes  core specialties as general medicine and general practice (around 12 months each), pediatrics, gynecology, orthopedics and psychiatry. Shorter and optional placements in ENT, ophthalmology, ED, infectious diseases, rheumathology or others add up to the 4 years curriculum. The assessment is work based and involves completing a logbook that ensures all the expected skills, abilities and aptitudes have been acquired by the end of the training period. <ref>http://www.msc.es/profesionales/formacion/docs/medifamiliar.pdf</ref><ref>http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examen_MIR</ref>

Nowadays some of the specialists in family practice in Spain are forced to work in other countries (mainly UK, Portugal and France) due to lack of stable work in their home country.   <ref>http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/08/06/actualidad/1344284347_177524.html</ref>

=== United Kingdom ===
<!-- This section is linked from [[List of Judge John Deed episodes]] -->
In the [[United Kingdom]], doctors wishing to become GPs take at least 5 years training after [[Medical school (United Kingdom)|medical school]], which is usually an undergraduate course of five to six years (or a graduate course of four to six years) leading to the degrees of [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery|Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery]] (MB,ChB/BS).

Up until the year 2005, those wanting to become a General Practitioner of medicine had to do a minimum of the following postgraduate training:
* one year as a [[pre-registration house officer]] (PRHO) (formerly called a house officer), in which the trainee would usually spend 6 months on a general surgical ward and 6 months on a general medical ward in a hospital;
* two years as a [[senior house officer]] (SHO) - often on a General Practice Vocational Training Scheme (GP-VTS) in which the trainee would normally complete four 6-month jobs in hospital specialties such as obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, geriatric medicine, accident and emergency or psychiatry;
* one year as a general practice registrar on a GP-VTS.

This process has changed under the programme [[Modernising Medical Careers]].  [[Physician|Medical practitioners]] graduating from 2005 onward have to do a minimum of 5 years postgraduate training:
* two years of ''Foundation Training'', in which the trainee will do a rotation around either six 4-month jobs or eight 3-month jobs - these include at least 3-months in general medicine and 3-months in general surgery, but will also include jobs in other areas;

*  A three-year "run-through" GP Specialty Training Program containing (GPSTP): 18 months as a Specialty Registrar in which time the trainee completes a mixture of jobs in hospital specialties such as [[obstetrics]] and [[gynaecology]], [[paediatrics]], [[geriatric medicine]], [[Emergency department|accident and emergency]] or [[psychiatry]]; 18 months as a GP Specialty Registrar in General Practice.
<div>

|{{NHS medical career grades}}

</div>

During the GP specialty training program, the medical practitioner must complete a variety of assessments in order to be allowed to practice independently as a GP. There is a knowledge-based exam with multiple choice questions called the Applied Knowledge Test (AKT). The practical examination takes the form of a "simulated surgery" in which the doctor is presented with 13 clinical cases and assessment is made of data gathering, interpersonal skills and clinical management. This Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) is held on three or four occasions throughout the year and takes place in the specially designed centre at Croydon. Finally throughout the year the doctor must complete an electronic portfolio which is made up of case-based discussions, critique of videoed consultations and reflective entries into a "learning log".

Membership of the [[Royal College of General Practitioners]] was previously optional. However, new trainee GP's from 2008 are now compulsorily required to complete the nMRCGP. They will not be allowed to practice without this postgraduate qualification. After passing the exam or assessment, they are awarded the specialist qualification of MRCGP – Member of the Royal College of General Practitioners. Previously qualified general practitioners (prior to 2008) are not required to hold the MRCGP, but it is considered desirable. In addition, many hold qualifications such as the DCH (Diploma in Child Health of the [[Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health]]) and/or the DRCOG (Diploma of the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]]) and/or the DGH (Diploma in Geriatric Medicine of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]). Some General Practitioners also hold the MRCP (Member of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]) or other specialist qualifications, but generally only if they had a hospital career, or a career in another speciality, before training in General Practice.

There are many arrangements under which general practitioners can work in the UK. While the main career aim is becoming a principal or partner in a GP surgery, many become salaried or non-principal GPs, work in hospitals in GP-led acute care units, or perform locum work. Whichever of these roles they fill, the vast majority of GPs receive most of their income from the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). Principals and partners in GP surgeries are self-employed, but they have contractual arrangements with the NHS which give them considerable predictability of income.

[[Image:JerichoHealthCentre20050326 CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|left|GPs in the United Kingdom may operate in community health centres.]]Visits to GP surgeries are free in all countries of the United Kingdom, but charges for prescription only medicine vary. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have abolished all charges. In England, however, most adults of working age who are not on benefits have to pay a standard charge for [[prescription only medicine]] of £7.60 per item from April 2012.

Recent reforms to the [[National Health Service|NHS]] have included changing the [[General medical services|GP contract]]. General practitioners are now not required to work unsociable hours, and get paid to some extent according to their [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|performance]], e.g. numbers of patients treated, what treatments were administered, and the health of their catchment area, through the [[Quality and Outcomes Framework]]. They are encouraged to prescribe medicines by their generic names. The IT system used for assessing their income based on these criteria is called [[Quality Management and Analysis System|QMAS]]. A GP can expect to earn about £70,000 a year without doing any overtime, although this figure is extremely variable. A 2006 report<ref>{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1759412,00.html |title=Perks of an island GP: seals, scenery and £300,000 |publisher=The Observer |author=Jo Revill |work= |accessdate=2008-06-17 |date=2006-04-23 | location=London}}</ref> noted that some GPs were earning £250k per year, with the highest-paid on £300k for working alone across five islands in the [[Outer Hebrides]]. However, a full-time GMS or PMS practice partner can now expect to earn around £95,900 before tax, while a salaried GP earns on average £66,500.<ref>http://www.mysalary.co.uk/average-salary/Gp_1231</ref> This equates to an hourly rate of around £40 an hour for a GP partner.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1756277,00.html |title=The question: Is your GP worth £250,000? |publisher=The Guardian |work= |accessdate=2008-06-17 | location=London | first=Sarah | last=Boseley | date=2006-04-19}}</ref>

== North America ==

=== Canada ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
In [[Canada]], the term general practitioner often has two meanings. The Canadian specialty that is equivalent to the British general practitioner training program is [[family medicine]] which accounts for almost 40% of the residency positions for graduating students. Following four years in medical school, a resident will spend 2–3 years in an accredited family medicine program. At the end of this, residents are eligible to be examined for Certification in [[The College of Family Physicians of Canada]]. Many hospitals and health regions now require this certification. To maintain their certificate, medical practitioners must document ongoing learning and upgrade activities to accumulate "MainPro" credits. Some practitioners add an extra year of training in emergency medicine and can thus be additionally certified as CCFP(EM). Extra training in anesthesia, surgery and obstetrics may also be recognized but this is not standardized across the country.

General practitioners in Canada do operate in private practice, in that they are not employees of the government. They either own their own practice or work for a privately owned practice. However, the majority of GPs are remunerated via their provincial governments' publicly funded health insurance plans, via a variety of payment mechanisms, including fee-for-service, salaried positions, and alternate payment plans. There is increasing interest in the latter as a means to promote best practices within a managed economic environment. As standard office practice has become less financially viable in recent years, many FPs now pursue areas of special interest. In rural areas, the majority of FPs still provide a broad, well-rounded scope of practice. Manpower inequities in rural areas are now being addressed with some innovative training and inducement mechanisms. An imbalance between physician manpower and a growing patient load has resulted in [[orphan patients]] who find it difficult to access primary care, but this is not unique to Canada. Family Medicine is recently recognized as a Medical Specialty in Canada. Family Physicians who pass the Certification exam, CCFP, become Specialist in Family Medicine.

=== United States ===
[[physician|Medical practitioner]]s must hold a license to practice medicine in the United States. The requirement is to be enrolled in or have completed a year of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]], traditionally called a rotating internship. There are generally four years of undergraduate college and four years of medical school prior to the internship. All prospective licentiates (denoted as physicians and surgeons in most states, e.g., California) who pass step three of the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE) or level three of the [[Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination]] (COMLEX-USA) and successfully complete an accredited internship may practice the full range of medicine.

The population of this type of medical practitioner is declining, however. Currently the [[United States Navy]] has many of these general practitioners, formally known as General Medical Officers or GMOs, in active practice. The GMO is an inherent concept to all military medical branches. GMOs are the gatekeepers of medicine in that they hold the purse strings and decide upon the merit of specialist consultation. The US now holds a different definition for the term "general practitioner". The two terms "general practitioner" and "family practice" were synonymous prior to 1970. At that time both terms (if used within the US) referred to someone who completed medical school and the one-year required internship, and then worked as a general family doctor. Completion of a post-graduate specialty training program or residency in [[family medicine]] was, at that time, not a requirement. A [[physician]] who specializes in "family medicine" must now complete a residency in family medicine, and must be eligible for [[board certification]], which is required by many hospitals and health plans for hospital privileges and remuneration, respectively. It was not until the 1970s that family medicine was recognized as a specialty in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theabfm.org/about/history.aspx |title=History of the Specialty |publisher=[[American Board of Family Medicine]] |author= Pisacano, Nicholas J. |accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref>

Many licensed family [[physician|medical practitioners]] in the United States after this change began to use the term "general practitioner" to refer to those practitioners who previously did not complete a family medicine [[residency (medicine)|residency]]. Family physicians (after completing [[medical school]]) must then complete three to four years of additional residency in family medicine. Three hundred hours of medical education within the prior six years is also required to be eligible to sit for the board certification exam; these hours are largely acquired during residency training.

The existing general practitioners in the 1970s were given the choice to be grandfathered into the newly created specialty of Family Practice. As well, the American Academy of General Practice changed its name to the American Academy of Family Physicians.<ref>{{cite web

When the American Academy of Family Practice was created, the American Academy of General Practice was abolished. Several members of the AMA were in opposition to this and predicted that another General Practice organization would inevitably result, including Susan Black, MD. She predicted a "second coming" of a "General Practice Movement". Several physicians nationwide created the American Academy of General Physicians. They prescribed a body of knowledge that defined a "General Practitioner". 

General practitioners have in the past, and currently are being created by the present system of producing doctors. 

Prior to recent history most postgraduate education in the United States was accomplished using the mentor system.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} A physician would finish a rotating internship and move to some town and be taught by the local physicians the skills needed for that particular town. This allowed each community's needs to be met by the teaching of the new general practitioner the skills needed in that community. This also allowed the new physician to start making a living and raising a family, etc. General practitioners would be the surgeons, the obstetricians, and the internists for their given communities. Changes in demographics and the growing complexities of the developing bodies of knowledge made it necessary to produce more highly trained surgeons and other specialists. For many physicians it was a natural desire to want to be considered "specialists".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} What was not anticipated by many physicians is that an option to be a generalist would be abolished.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Recently,{{When|date=December 2010}} new fellowships in [[International Family Medicine]] have emerged. These fellowships are designed to train family physicians working in resource poor environments.<ref>[http://www.vcfm.net/fellowships/international-medicine-fellowship/ "International Family Medicine Fellowship"], Via Christi Retrieved 4/14/2010.</ref>

There is currently{{When|date=December 2010}} a shortage of [[primary care physician]]s (and also other primary care providers) due to several factors, notably the lesser prestige associated with the young specialty, the lower pay, and the increasingly frustrating practice environment. In the US physicians are increasingly forced to do more administrative work,<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2009/07/16/news/economy/healthcare_doctors_shortage/ "Family doctors: An endangered breed", CNNMoney.com July 16, 2009]</ref> and shoulder higher malpractice premiums.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
General Practice in Australia and New Zealand has undergone many changes in training requirements over the past decade. The basic medical degree in Australia is the MBBS, and New Zealand the MBChB degree (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery), which has traditionally been attained after completion of an undergraduate five or six-year course. Over the last few years, an ever increasing number of post-graduate four-year medical programs (previous bachelors degree required) have become more common and now account more than half of all Australian medical graduates. After graduating, a one year internship is completed in a public and private hospitals prior to obtaining full registration.  Many newly registered medical practitioners undergo one year or more of pre-vocational position as Resident Medical Officers (different titles depending on jurisdictions) before specialist training begins. For general practice training, the medical practitioner then applies to enter a three- or four-year  program either through the "Australasian General Practice Training Program", "Remote Vocational Training Scheme" or "Independent Pathway". {GP Australia}. 
A combination of coursework and apprenticeship type training leading to the awarding of the FRACGP (Fellowship of the [[Royal Australian College of General Practitioners]]), FACRRM (Fellowship of [[Australian College of Remote and Rural Medicine]]) or FRNZCGP (Fellowship of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners), if successful. Since 1996 this qualification or its equivalent has been required in order for the GP to access [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] rebates as a general practitioner. Medicare is Australia's [[universal health care|universal health insurance]] system, and without access to it, a practitioner cannot effectively work in private practice in Australia. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
Procedural General Practice training in combination with General Practice Fellowship was first established by the "Australian College of Remote and Rural Medicine"  in 2004. This new fellowship was developed in aid to recognise the specialised skills required to work within a rural and remote context. In addition it was hoped to recognise the impending urgency of training Rural Procedural Practitioners to sustain Obstetric and Surgical services within rural Australia. Each training registrar select a speciality that can be utilised in a rural area from the Advanced Skills Training list and spends a minimum of 12 months completing this specialty, the most common of which are Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynaecology and Anaesthetics. Further choices of specialty include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health, Adult Internal Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Mental Health, Paediatrics, Population health and Remote Medicine. 
Shortly after the establishment of the FACRRM, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners introduced an additional training year (from the basic 3 years) to offer the "Fellowship in Advanced Rural General Practice". The additional year, or Advanced Rural Skills Training (ARST) can be conducted in various locations from Tertiary Hospitals to Small General Practice.

In New Zealand, most GPs work within a practice that is part of a [[Primary Health Organisation]] (PHO). These are funded at a population level, based on the characteristics of a practice's enrolled population (referred to as capitation-based funding). Fee-for-service arrangements still exist with other funders such as Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and Ministry of Social Development (MSD), as well as receiving co-payments from patients to top-up the capitation-based funding. In NZ new graduates must complete the RNZCGP GPEP (General Practice Education Program) Stages I and II in order to be granted the title FRNZCGP, which includes the PRIMEX assessment and further CME and Peer group learning sessions as directed by the RNZCGP. Holders of the award of FRNZCGP may apply for specialist recognition with the New Zealand Medical Council (MCNZ), after which they are considered specialists in General Practice by the council and the community. {{fact|date=April 2013}}

Increasingly a portion of income is derived from government payments for participation in chronic disease management programs.

There is a shortage of GPs in rural areas and increasingly outer metropolitan areas of large cities, which has led to the utilisation of overseas trained doctors (international medical graduates (IMGs)).

== Pay ==
Pay of medical practitioners varies widely in different countries throughout the world. In the UK, for example, full-time self-employed GPs can currently expect to earn a profit share of around £100,000  per annum while PCT employed GPs can currently expect to earn a salary of £53,781 to £81,158.<ref>[http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=553 ''Pay for doctors,'' NHS careers]</ref>
