{{animal testing}}
A '''great ape research ban''', or severe restrictions on the use of non-human [[great ape]]s in research, is currently in place in the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. These countries have ruled that [[chimpanzee]]s, [[bonobo]]s, [[gorilla]]s, and [[orangutans]] are [[Cognition|cognitively]] so similar to humans that using them as test subjects is unethical. Austria is the only country in the world where experiments on lesser apes, the gibbons, are completely banned too.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==New Zealand==
New Zealand granted basic rights to five great ape species in 1999. Their use is now forbidden in research, testing or teaching.<ref>[http://www.animallaw.info/journals/jo_pdf/lralvol_7p35.pdf "A STEP AT A TIME: NEW ZEALAND’S PROGRESS TOWARD HOMINID RIGHTS" BY ROWAN TAYLOR]</ref>

==United States==
The [[United States]] is the world's largest user of chimpanzees for [[biomedical research]], with approximately 1,200 individual subjects currently in U.S. labs.<ref>[http://www.releasechimps.org/2008/04/17/federal-bill-introduced-to-end-invasive-research-on-chimpanzees/ Federal Bill Introduced to End Invasive Research on Chimpanzees]</ref> On December 15, 2011, US [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) declared in a report (see report brief<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Chimpanzees-in-Biomedical-and-Behavioral-Research-Assessing-the-Necessity/Report-Brief.aspx?page=1|title=Chimpanzees in Biomedical and Behavioral Research: Assessing the Necessity|publisher=Institute of Medicine|date=December 15, 2011|work=iom.edu|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref>) that ‘most current use of chimpanzees for biomedical research is unnecessary’ and recommended to curtail the government funded research on human’s closest relative.<ref name=nature>{{cite web|url= http://www.nature.com/news/us-chimpanzee-research-to-be-curtailed-1.9663|title=US Chimpanzee Research to be Curtailed|author=Wadman, Meredity|date=December 16, 2011|work=Nature.com|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref>  [[Francis Collins]], director of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) announced<ref name=nih>{{cite web|url= http://www.nih.gov/news/health/dec2011/od-15.htm|title=Statement by NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins on the Institute of Medicine report addressing the scientific need for the use of chimpanzees in research|date=December 15, 2011|work=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref> on the same day that he accepted the recommendations and will develop the implementation plan which includes the forming of an expert committee to review all submitted grant applications and projects already underway involving the use of chimpanzees.  Furthermore no new grant applications using chimpanzees will be reviewed until further notice.<ref name=nature/><ref name=nih/> On 21 September 2012, NIH announced that 110 chimpanzees owned by the government will be retired.  NIH owes about 500 chimpanzees for research, this move signifies the first step to wind down NIH’s investment in chimpanzee research, according to Francis Collins.  Currently housed at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette|New Iberia Research Center]] in [[Louisiana]], 10 of the retired chimpanzees will go to the chimpanzee sanctuary [[Chimp Haven]] while the rest will go to [[Texas Biomedical Research Institute]] in [[San Antonio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/09/21/161556143/government-officials-retire-chimpanzees-from-research?ft=1&f=1001|title=Government Officials Retire Chimpanzees From Research|author=Greenfieldboyce, Nell|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=24 September 2012}}</ref>  However, concerns over the chimpanzee’s status in the Texas Biomedical Research Institute as ‘research ineligible’ rather than ‘retired’ prompted NIH to reconsider the plan and it announced on 17 October 2012 that as many chimpanzees as possible will be relocated to Chimp Haven by August 2013 and eventually all 110 will move there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/17/14125394-goodall-praises-nih-decision-to-remove-some-chimps-from-research-but-controversy-erupts-over-their-next-home?lite|title=Goodall praises NIH decision to remove some chimps from research, but controversy erupts over their next home|author=Lisa Myers and Diane Beasley|publisher=nbcnews.com|date=17 October 2012|accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref>
On 22 January 2013, a NIH task force released a report calling for the government to retire most of the chimpanzees the U.S. government support.  The panel concluded that the animals provide little benefit in biomedical discoveries except in a few disease cases which can be supported by a small population of 50 primates for future research.  Other approaches such as genetically altered mice should be developed and refined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-22/u-s-panel-calls-for-limits-on-medical-use-of-chimpanzees.html|title=U.S. Panel Calls for Limits on Medical Use of Chimpanzees|author=Flinn, Ryan|publisher=Bloomberg.com|date=23 January 2013|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://dpcpsi.nih.gov/council/pdf/FNL_Report_WG_Chimpanzees.pdf|title=Council of Councils Working Group on the Use of Chimpanzees in NIH-Supported Research Report|author=Working Group on the Use of Chimpanzees in National Institutes of Health (NIH)-Supported Research|publisher=NIH|date=22 January 2013}}</ref>

==United Kingdom==
Announcing the UK’s ban in 1986, the British [[Home Secretary]] said: "[T]his is a matter of morality. The cognitive and behavioural characteristics and qualities of these animals mean it is unethical to treat them as expendable for research." Britain continues to use other [[primate]]s in laboratories, such as [[macaque]]s and [[marmoset]]s. In 2006 the permanency of the UK ban was questioned by [[Colin Blakemore]], head of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]. Blakemore, while stressing he saw no "immediate need" to lift the ban,  argued "that under certain circumstances, such as the emergence of a lethal [[pandemic]] virus that only affected the great apes, including man, then experiments on chimps, orang-utans and even gorillas may become necessary." The [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] described Blakemore's stance as "backward-looking." <ref>{{cite news
