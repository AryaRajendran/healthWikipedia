'''Protein S deficiency''' is a disorder associated with increased risk of [[venous thrombosis]]. Protein S, a [[vitamin K]]-dependent physiological anticoagulant, acts as a nonenzymatic cofactor to activated protein C in the proteolytic degradation of [[factor V]]a and [[factor VIII]]a. Decreased (antigen) levels or impaired function (activity) of [[protein S]] leads to decreased degradation of [[factor V]]a and [[factor VIII]]a and an increased propensity to venous thrombosis. Protein S circulates in human plasma in two forms: approximately 60 percent is bound to complement component C4b β-chain while the remaining 40 percent is free. Only free protein S has activated protein C cofactor activity.

==Types==
There are three types of hereditary protein S deficiency:
*Type I - decreased [[protein]] S activity: decreased total protein S (=both bound and free protein S) levels AND decreased free [[protein S]] levels (quantitative defect)
*Type II - decreased protein S activity: normal free protein S levels AND normal total protein S levels (qualitative defect)
*Type III - decreased protein S activity: decreased free protein S levels AND normal total protein S levels (quantitative defect)

Protein S deficiency can also be acquired due to vitamin K deficiency or treatment with [[warfarin]], systemic sex hormone therapy and pregnancy, liver disease, and certain chronic infections (for example HIV). Vitamin K deficiency or treatment with [[warfarin]] generally also impairs the coagulation system itself (factors II, VII, IX and X), and therefore predisposes to [[hemorrhage|bleeding]] rather than thrombosis. 
Protein S deficiency is the underlying cause of a small proportion of cases of [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC), [[deep venous thrombosis]] (DVT) and [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE).
