The intersection of '''Scientology and abortion''' has a controversial history which began with Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s discussion of abortion in his 1950 book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]''. Hubbard wrote in ''Dianetics'' that abortion and attempts at abortion could cause trauma to the fetus and to the mother in both spiritual and physical ways. Scientologists came to believe that attempted abortions could cause traumatic experiences felt by the fetus, which would later be remembered as memories referred to in Scientology as "[[Engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]". In the Scientology technique called [[Auditing (Scientology)|Auditing]], Scientologists are frequently queried regarding their sexual feelings and behaviors. These questions about Scientologists' sexual behavior are often posed to members during "security checks", a specific form of auditing sessions where individuals are required to document their divergence from the organization's ethics. One of the questions asked in these security checks is, "Have you ever been involved in an abortion?".

A female former member of Scientology's elite organization called the [[Sea Org]] discussed the views of Scientology with regard to abortion with [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Stephen A. Kent]]. She told Kent that while the Sea Org operated at sea during the mid-1970s, women understood that they were not to have children. She stated to Kent that women on the ships were pressured into having abortions. In 1994, former Scientologist and Sea Org member Mary Tabayoyon filed a legal declaration in which she said that while at Scientology's base in [[Hemet]], [[California]] members of the Sea Org were instructed not to have children, and were coerced to have abortions. In 1999, former Scientologist Jesse Prince told ''[[The Press-Enterprise (California)|The Press-Enterprise]]'' that after his wife Monika became pregnant while both were working at the Scientology complex [[Golden Era Productions]] in [[Gilman Hot Springs]], [[California]], she was ordered to have an abortion in order for the couple to remain in the Sea Org. Scientology representatives at the time asserted that Prince's wife chose of her own volition to have an abortion, and was not forced to do so.

In 2001, former Scientologist [[Astra Woodcraft]] told the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' that if a woman gets pregnant while in the Sea Org, she will either be sent to a lower-level organization of Scientology, or be pressured to have an abortion. In April 2008, Woodcraft appeared along with Scientology leader [[David Miscavige]]'s [[niece]] [[Jenna Miscavige Hill]] on the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline]]'', and both asserted that Sea Org members who become pregnant are told to either leave or get an abortion. Claire Headley was an employee at Scientology's facility [[Golden Era Productions]] from 1991 to 2005 and a Scientologist and Sea Org member. In 2009, she filed a lawsuit against Golden Era Productions in which she asserted she was forced to undergo two abortions in order to keep her position with her employer. Scientology representative [[Thomas W. Davis|Tommy Davis]] described her lawsuit as "utterly meritless", and said that Scientologists who sign up for the Sea Org know that they are "becoming a part of a highly dedicated, highly disciplined, very regulated lifestyle as part of a religious order". Laura Ann DeCrescenzo filed a lawsuit in 2009 against Scientology, in which she asserted that she was forced to have an abortion at age 17.

In commentary on Scientology and practices in the Sea Org, new religions scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]] told the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' that members of the Sea Org are discouraged from having children. Melton wrote in a contribution in the book ''New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America'' that he had yet to see documents confirming whether Scientology had a policy demanding that pregnant members of the Sea Org get an abortion. In an article for the ''[[Marburg Journal of Religion]]'', [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Stephen A. Kent]] wrote that "researchers should not be surprised to learn of pressures that Sea Org women felt to either abort pregnancies or give-up children for adoption". Kent commented, "Sea Org obligations override many personal and family obligations and responsibilities, and devotion to the Scientology cause often appears to take priority over the needs of children."

In a 1950 article in ''Look'' magazine, Albert Q. Maisel wrote, "Unlike many religious groups, the proponents of dianetics have nothing against birth control.

In a 1987 interview with [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Stephen A.

It wasn't like anybody said 'You have got to get an abortion.' It was more an implied thing. If you don't you're going to leave," said the woman to Kent.<ref name="kent" />

According to Brian Kelly, [[editor in chief]] of ''From the Housestops'' journal, Sea Org members were shown unpublished writings by L.

Mary Tabayoyon joined Scientology in 1967 and became a member of the Sea Org in 1971, later leaving Scientology in 1992.<ref name="kent" /> Tabayoyon filed a legal declaration on August 26, 1994 in the case ''Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz'', describing Scientology's practices on having children in the Sea Org.<ref name="sly" /><ref name="kent" /> Tabayoyon wrote that a Sea Org order issued September 26, 1986 stated that having children while in the elite division of Scientology was forbidden.<ref name="sly" /> She said that while at Scientology's base in [[Hemet]], [[California]], "members of the Sea Org were forbidden to have any more children if they were to stay on post[,] and the Hubbard technology was applied to coercively persuade us to have abortions so that we could remain on post".<ref name="kent" /> According to Tabayoyon this pressure was exerted during a Scientology procedure known as "ethics handling", where individuals were instructed to go along with L. Ron Hubbard's policies as well as those of Scientology.<ref name="kent" /> Tabayoyon said "[I] gave up my child due to my greatly misguided obligation and dedication to the Sea Org".<ref name="kent" /> She stated she made the decision to give up her child because she was "indoctrinated to believe that I should never put my own personal desires ahead of the accomplishment of the purpose of the Sea Org".<ref name="kent" />

In 1999, former Scientologist Jesse Prince told ''[[The Press-Enterprise (California)|The Press-Enterprise]]'' that after his wife Monika became pregnant while both were working at the Scientology complex [[Golden Era Productions]] in [[Gilman Hot Springs]], [[California]], she was ordered to have an abortion in order for the couple to remain in the Sea Org.<ref name="exchurchmemberfights">{{cite news   | last =Thurston  | first =Susan   | title =Ex-church member fights for right to speak out Scientology officials deny claim his wife was ordered to have abortion   | work =[[The Press-Enterprise (California)|The Press-Enterprise]]  | page =A03  | publisher =The Press-Enterprise Co.  | date =January 31, 1999}}</ref> "The order devastated both my wife and me.

Every person that says they have been coerced are saying it for another reason. Nobody is coerced into doing anything in the Church of Scientology. The purpose of Scientology is to increase a person's self-determinism," said Hoden.<ref name="exchurchmemberfights" /> The director of public affairs for the Church of Scientology International, Aron Mason, said Prince's statements were motivated by financial reasons, and stated to ''The Press-Enterprise'', "He is only existing because he gets paid to say the party line for people who are anti-Scientologists."<ref name="exchurchmemberfights" />

Betty Hardin, a former worker in the finance department at Golden Era Productions, has described routinely driving pregnant women to the [[Planned Parenthood]] center in [[Riverside, California]] to obtain abortions and follow-up treatment.<ref name="voltz" /> According to Hardin, she eventually got out of being the driver for the "abortion run" because the anti-abortion activists who often picketed the Planned Parenthood center saw her so often that they came to recognize her.<ref name="voltz">{{cite book|last=Voltz|first=Tom|title=Scientology und (k)ein Ende|page=170|publisher=Walter|year=1995|isbn=978-3-530-89980-1}}</ref>

Tera Hathaway filed an affidavit in 2001 which stated, "[The Executive Director] had gone on to say that at this point in my life it is better to do the greatest good for all. That spending my life ‘clearing the planet’ which means basically to get the planet saved from insanity, would be the greatest good, in other words, a far more noble endeavor than leaving staff to raise a child. She went on to tell me that the spirit doesn't enter the baby's body until the baby is born. She made the point that all I would be ‘killing’ is a piece of meat essentially. We discussed this for a couple of days and she showed me definitions in the L. Ron Hubbard Technical Dictionary to persuade me to have an abortion."<ref name="sly" />

==Commentary==
In his book ''[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]'', author Jon Atack commented, "A rather peculiar aspect of ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' was Hubbard's emphasis on 'attempted abortions.'"<ref name="atack" /> Atack pointed out that Hubbard thought attempted abortions caused ulcers, and noted, "He had been suffering from a duodenal ulcer since 1943.<ref name="atack" /> Author George Malko wrote in ''[[Scientology: The Now Religion]]'' that "Hubbard's extensive discussion of things sexual, his concern with abortions, beatings, coitus under duress, flatulence which causes pressure on the foetus, certain cloacal references, all suggest to me a fascination which borders on the obsessive, as if he possessed a deep-seated hatred of women. All of them are being beaten, most of them prove to be unfaithful, few babies are wanted."<ref name="atack" /><ref name="malko">{{cite book  | last =Malko  | first =George  | title =[[Scientology: The Now Religion]]  | publisher =Delacorte Press  | year =1970  | page =52  | isbn =1-112-96373-1 }}</ref> Hubbard's interest in abortions was criticized in the 1965 [[Anderson Report]] as "a morbid preoccupation with matters relating to abnormal behaviour of women" and "a prurient and distinctly unhealthy attachment to abortions, rape, perversion, and similar matters."<ref name="Anderson-44">{{cite book|last=Anderson | first=Kevin Victor | authorlink=Kevin Victor Anderson| title=Report of the Board of Inquiry into Scientology|page=44|year=1965|publisher=State of Victoria}}</ref>

New religions scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]] told the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' that Scientology discourages members of the Sea Org from having children.<ref name="leavingthefold" /> "They don't look at children as a resource, but as a problem. Children take people off-line, so they discourage members of the Sea Org from having children," said Melton.<ref name="leavingthefold" /> In the book ''New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America'', Melton contributed a chapter, "A Contemporary Ordered Religious Community: The Sea Organization".<ref name="davis">{{cite book  | last =Davis  | first =Derek   | coauthors =Barry Hankins  | title =New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America  | publisher =Baylor University Press  | year =2003  | pages =53, 191  | isbn = 0-918954-92-4}}</ref> In the piece, Melton commented on statements he had seen about Scientology and abortion in "anti-Scientology literature".<ref name="davis" /> Melton wrote, "It has been asserted in some anti-Scientology literature that the Church had, at least for a time period, demanded that any female Sea Org members who became pregnant obtain an abortion. I have been unable to find any verification of that allegation."<ref name="davis" /> Melton went on to assert, "Given the nature of the church, were this ever to have become a policy of the Sea Org, there would have undoutedly been a paper trail of documents which, if they existed, have never been produced."<ref name="davis" />

In an article in the ''[[Marburg Journal of Religion]]'', Stephen A. Kent discussed Scientology and abortion, writing "Because the attitude among some Sea Org leadership appears to be that children hinder adults from performing their vital assignments, researchers should not be surprised to learn of pressures that Sea Org women felt to either abort pregnancies or give-up children for adoption."<ref name="kent" /> He commented, "Taken together, the interviews, legal declarations, media accounts, and internal documents present troubling glimpses into the lives of Scientology's most committed members. Sea Org obligations override many personal and family obligations and responsibilities, and devotion to the Scientology cause often appears to take priority over the needs of children."<ref name="kent">{{cite journal  | last =Kent  | first =Stephen A.  | authorlink =Stephen A.

In a 1998 speech, attorney and Scientology critic Graham E. Berry commented on Mary Tabayoyan's affidavit about Scientology and abortion, "Mary Tabayoyan has testified as to how she and other Scientologists were ordered to have abortions; and I have argued before a court that that constitutes instructions to commit murder.
