Since the vaccine only covers some high-risk types of HPV, experts still recommend that women get regular Pap smear screening even after vaccination.<ref name ="National Cancer Institute HPV Q&A"/>

HPV vaccination is approved for use in males in many areas.  In addition to protecting their partners from cervical cancer, vaccination can protect males against anal cancer, and may prevent other HPV associated cancers.  Gardasil can also protect males against genital warts.  HPV vaccination has been recommended for males in the United States, where vaccine uptake among women has been low.  Vaccination  is also recommended in populations at higher risk for HPV associated cancers, such as men who have sex with men and those with compromised immune response.

==Vaccine target populations==
<!-- Indications -->

Gardasil and Cervarix are preventative vaccines and do not treat HPV infection or cervical cancer. They are recommended for women who are 9 to 25 years old who have not been exposed to HPV. However, since it is unlikely that a woman will have already contracted all four viruses, and because HPV is primarily sexually transmitted, the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has recommended vaccination for women up to 26 years of age.

===Males===

HPV vaccines are approved for males in several countries, including Australia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  

On 9 September 2009, an advisory panel recommended that the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) licence Gardasil in the United States for boys and men ages 9–26 for the prevention of genital warts<ref>

As with females, the vaccine should be administered before infection with the HPV types covered by the vaccine occurs. Vaccination before adolescence therefore makes it more likely that the recipient has not been exposed to HPV.

An advisory panel for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] voted to recommend that the vaccine be given to boys ages 11–12. The panel's recommendation is intended to prevent genital warts and anal cancers in males, and possibly prevent head and neck cancer (though the vaccine's effectiveness against head and neck cancers has not yet been proven.)<ref>{{cite web|last=Rettner|first=Rachael|title=Boys Should Get HPV Vaccine Too, CDC Says|url=http://www.livescience.com/16707-hpv-vaccine-boys-cdc-recommendations.html|publisher=[[LiveScience]]|accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref>

=== Older women ===
When Gardasil was first introduced, it was recommended as a prevention for cervical cancer for women that were 25 years old or younger. New evidence suggests that all Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are effective in preventing cervical cancer for women up to 45 years of age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourcancertoday.com/news/HPV-update.html|title=HPV Vaccine Update |publisher=[[Your Cancer Today]]|date=2007-12-11}}</ref>

In November 2007, Merck presented new data on Gardasil. In an investigational study, Gardasil reduced incidence of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18-related persistent infection and disease in women through age 45. The study evaluated women who had not contracted at least one of the HPV types targeted by the vaccine by the end of the three-dose vaccination series. Merck planned to submit this data before the end of 2007 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to seek an indication for Gardasil for women through age 45.<ref>5 November 2007, [http://web.archive.org/web/20071112010855/http://www.merck.com/newsroom/press_releases/product/2007_1105.html New Data Presented on GARDASIL, Merck's Cervical Cancer Vaccine, in Women Through Age 45].

==Contraindications and precautions==

While the use of HPV vaccines can help reduce cervical cancer deaths by two thirds around the world,<ref>{{cite web|title=Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccines|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Prevention/HPV-vaccine}}</ref> not everyone is eligible for vaccination. There are some patient factors that exclude people from receiving Gardasil or Cervarix. There factors include:<ref name="fact sheet">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-vaccine-hcp.htm|title=HPV Vaccine Information for Clinicians - Fact Sheet|publisher=CDC}}</ref>

*Patients with history of immediate hypersensitivity to vaccine components. Patients with a hypersensitivity to yeast should not receive Gardasil since yeast is used in its production.

*Patients with moderate or severe [[acute illness]]es. This does not completely exclude patients from vaccination, it just postpones the time of vaccination until the illness has improved.<ref name="recommendations">{{cite web|url=http://pcph.pocahontascoia.us/pdfdocs/HPV_Vaccine.pdf|title=Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Recommendations|publisher=FDA}}</ref>

===During pregnancy===
In the Gardasil clinical trials, 1,115 pregnant women received the HPV vaccine. Overall, the proportions of pregnancies with an adverse outcome were comparable in subjects who received Gardasil and subjects who received placebo.<ref name="Merck_Pregnancy">[http://www.merckpregnancyregistries.com/gardisil.html Merck Pregnancy Registries - GARDASIL<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, the clinical trials had a relatively small sample size. Currently the vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women.<ref name="Merck_Pregnancy" /><ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) | url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/should-not-vacc.htm#hpv | title=Who Should NOT Get Vaccinated with these Vaccines? | date=2010-6-10 | accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref> The long-term effects of the vaccine on fertility are not known, but no effects are anticipated.

The FDA has classified the HPV vaccine as a pregnancy Category B, meaning there is no apparent harm on the fetus in animal studies. HPV vaccines have not been causally related with adverse pregnancy outcomes or adverse effects on the fetus However, data on vaccination during pregnancy is very limited and vaccination during the pregnancy term should be delayed until more information is available. If a woman is found to be pregnant during the three dose series of vaccination, the series will be postponed until pregnancy has been completed. While there is no indication for intervention for vaccine dosages administered during pregnancy, patients and health-care providers are encouraged to report exposure to vaccines to the appropriate HPV vaccine pregnancy registry.<ref name="fact sheet"/><ref name="recommendations"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hpv.emedtv.com/hpv-vaccine/hpv-vaccine-and-pregnancy.html|title=HPV Vaccine and Pregnancy|publisher=eMedTV}}</ref>

Gardasil also protects against low-risk HPV types 6  and 11, which do not cause cancer, but do cause genital warts. 

A recent analysis of data from a clinical trial of Cervarix found that this vaccine is just as effective at protecting women against persistent HPV 16 and 18 infection in the anus as it is at protecting them from these infections in the cervix.  Overall, about 30 percent of cervical cancers will not be prevented by these vaccines. Also, in the case of Gardasil, 10 percent of genital warts will not be prevented by the vaccine. Neither vaccine prevents other sexually transmitted diseases, nor do they treat HPV infection or cervical cancer.<ref name=pmid_17380109/><ref name=CDC-HPV/>

HPV types 16, 18 and 45 contribute to 94% of cervical [[adenocarcinoma]] (cancers originating in the glandular cells of the cervix).<ref name=Tay />  While most cervical cancer arises in the squamous cells, adenocarcinomas make up a sizable minority of cancers.<ref name=Tay />  Further, Pap smears are not as effective at detecting adenocarcinomas, so where Pap screening programs are in place, a larger proportion of the remaining cancers are adenocarcinomas.<ref name=Tay />  Trials suggest that HPV vaccines may also reduce the incidence of adenocarcinoma.<ref name=Tay />

==Safety==
HPV vaccines are approved for use in over 100 countries, with more than 100 million doses distributed worldwide. Extensive clinical trial and post-marketing safety surveillance data indicate that both Gardasil and Cervarix are well tolerated and safe.

See [http://www.ncirs.edu.au/immunisation/fact-sheets/hpv-human-papillomavirus-fact-sheet.pdf Human papillomavirus Vaccines for Australians: information for immunisation providers, National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance Factsheet: March 2013]

Gardasil is a 3-dose (injection) vaccine. {{As of|2009|9|1}} there have been more than 26 million doses distributed in the United States, and there have been 15,037 [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] (VAERS) reports following the vaccination.<ref name ="CDC VAERS - Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System" /> Ninety-two percent were reports of events considered to be non-serious (e.g., fainting, pain and swelling at the injection site (arm), headache, nausea and fever), and 8 percent were considered to be serious (death, permanent disability, life-threatening illness and hospitalization). There is no proven causal link between the vaccine and serious adverse effects; all reports are related by time only. That is, they are only related because the effect happened some time after the vaccination.<ref name ="CDC VAERS - Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System">

According to the Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  and the FDA, the rate of adverse side effects related to Gardasil immunization in the safety review were consistent with what has been seen in the safety studies carried out before the vaccine was approved and were similar to those seen with other vaccines. However, a higher proportion of syncope (fainting) and venous thrombolic events (blood clots) were seen with Gardasil than are usually seen with other vaccines. The FDA and CDC have reminded health care providers that, to prevent falls and injuries, all vaccine recipients should remain seated or lying down and be closely observed for 15 minutes after vaccination.<ref name=CDC-HPV/>

According to the CDC, Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with approximately 20 million people currently infected and an estimated 6.2 million additional people who become newly infected every year. [2] More than 100 HPV types have been identified, over 40 of which can infect the genital area. [2] High risk, or oncogenic types, including types 16 and 18, can cause high-grade cervical cell abnormalities that are precursors to cervical cancer and other cancers such as vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers as well as some oropharyngeal cancers. [2] Low risk, or non-oncogenic types, such as HPV 6 or 11, can cause benign or low-grade abnormalities of cervical cells, genital warts, and a disease of the respiratory tract called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. [2] Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, causing no clinical manifestations. [2]

===Worldwide===
Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most deadly cancer in women.<ref name=Tay />
There were an estimated 529,000 new cases of cervical cancer, and 275,000 deaths in 2008.<ref name=Tay />  Due to the success of [[Pap smear]] screening programs at reducing cervical cancer in more developed countries, the majority of cervical cancers (85%) and deaths (80%) occur in less developed parts of the world.<ref name=Tay /><ref name=cervicalCAaction /><ref name=Parkin06 />

==Vaccination and public health==
{{quote|Widespread vaccination has the potential to reduce cervical cancer deaths around the world by as much as two-thirds, if all women were to take the vaccine and if protection turns out to be long-term. In addition, the vaccines can reduce the need for medical care, biopsies, and invasive procedures associated with the follow-up from abnormal Pap tests, thus helping to reduce health care costs and anxieties related to abnormal Pap tests and follow-up procedures.|American [[National Cancer Institute]]|<ref name="National Cancer Institute HPV Q&A"/>
}}

Comments made by Dr. Diane Harper, researcher for the HPV vaccines, were interpreted as indicating that in countries where Pap smear screening is common, it will take vaccination of a large proportion of women in order to further reduce cervical cancer rates.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/19/cbsnews_investigates/main5253431.shtml Gardasil Researcher Speaks Out], Sharyl Attkisson, CBS News, August 19, 2009</ref>

Current preventive vaccines protect against the two HPV types (16 and 18) that cause about 70% of cervical cancers worldwide.<ref name=Munoz2004 /> Because of the distribution of HPV types associated with cervical cancer, the vaccines are likely to be most effective in Asia, Europe and North America.<ref name=Munoz2004 /> Some other high risk types cause a larger percentage of cancers in other parts of the world.<ref name=Munoz2004 />  Vaccines that protect against more of the types common in cancers would prevent more cancers, and be less subject to regional variation.<ref name=Munoz2004 />  For instance, a vaccine against the seven types most common in cervical cancers (16, 18, 45, 31, 33, 52, 58) would prevent an estimated 87% of cervical cancers worldwide.<ref name=Munoz2004 />

Only 41% of women with cervical cancer in the developing world get medical treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wittet S. & Tsu V.| year=2008| title=Cervical cancer prevention and the Millennium Development Goals| journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization| volume = 86|issue=6 | pages = 488–90|pmid=18568279|pmc=2647477|doi=10.2471/BLT.07.050450}}</ref> Therefore, prevention of HPV by vaccination may be a more effective way of lowering the disease burden in developing countries than cervical screening. The [[ESGO|European Society of Gynecological Oncology]] sees the developing world as most likely to benefit from HPV vaccination.<ref name = "ESGO Statement on Cervical Cancer Vaccination">{{cite web|url= http://www.esgo.org/About_ESGO/Documents/Statement_HPV.pdf|title= ESGO Statement on Cervical Cancer Vaccination|publisher=ESGO|year= 2007}}</ref> However, individuals in many resource-limited nations, Kenya for example, are unable to afford the vaccine.<ref name ="Cervarix Marketing in Kenya">{{cite web|url= http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/81239.php| work = Medical News Today | title = Cervarix Marketing in Kenya| accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref>  

In more developed countries, populations that do not receive adequate medical care, such as poor or minorities in the United States or parts of Europe also have less access to cervical screening and appropriate treatment, and are similarly more likely to benefit.<ref name=Tay>|{{cite pmid| 22123221}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
The HPV vaccines are based on hollow [[virus-like particle]]s (VLPs) assembled from [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] HPV coat [[protein]]s. The virus possesses circular double stranded DNA and a viral shell that is composed of 72 capsomeres. Every subunit of the virus is composed of two proteins molecules, L1 and L2. The reason why this virus has the capability to affect the skin and the mucous layers is due to its structure. The primary structures expressed in these areas are E1 and E2, these proteins are responsible for the replication of the virus.<ref name="Arteaga">{{cite web|last=Arteaga|first=Arkaitz|title=The Shape and Structure of hpv|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Oropharyngeal+Cancer/articles/16/The+shape+and+structure+of+hpv|accessdate=03/07/12}}</ref> E1 is a highly conserved protein in the virus, E1 is in charge of the production of viral copies is also involved in every step of replication process.<ref name="Arteaga"/> The second component of this process is E2 ensures that non-specific interaction occur while interacting with E1.<ref name="Arteaga"/> As a result of these proteins working together is assures that numerous amounts of copies are made within the host cell. The structure of the virus is critical because this influence the infection affinity of the virus. Knowing the structure of the virus allowed for the development of an efficient vaccine, such Gardasil and Cervarix. 
The vaccines target the two high-risk HPVs, types 16 and 18 that cause the most cervical cancers. Gardasil's proteins are synthesized by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its protein makeup allows it to target four types of HPV. Gardasil contains inactive L1 proteins from four different HPV strains: 6, 11, 16, and 18. Each vaccine dose contains 225 mcg of aluminum, 9.56&nbsp;mg of sodium chloride, 0.78&nbsp;mg of L-histidine, 50 mcg of polysorbate 80, 35 mcg of sodium borate, and water. The combination of ingredients totals 0.5 mL.<ref name="WikiMarkup">http://ciitn.missouri.edu/cgi-bin/pub_view_project_ind.cgi?g_num=2&c_id=2007008</ref>
Together, these two HPV types currently cause about 70 percent of all [[cervical cancer]].<ref name=Munoz2004>{{cite journal| journal = Int J Cancer | date = 2004-08-20 | volume = 111 | title = Against which human papillomavirus types shall we vaccinate and screen?

Gardasil and Cervarix are designed to elicit virus-neutralizing [[antibody]] responses that prevent initial infection with the HPV types represented in the vaccine. The vaccines have been shown to offer 100 percent protection against the development of cervical [[pre-cancer]]s and genital warts caused by the HPV types in the vaccine, with few or no side effects. The protective effects of the vaccine are expected to last a minimum of 4.5 years after the initial vaccination.<ref name="Lancet">{{cite journal |author=Harper DM, Franco EL, Wheeler CM |title=Sustained efficacy up to 4.5 years of a bivalent L1 virus-like particle vaccine against human papillomavirus types 16 and 18: follow-up from a randomised control trial |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9518 |pages = 1247–55 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16631880 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68439-0 |url=}}</ref>

While the study period was not long enough for cervical cancer to develop, the prevention of these cervical precancerous lesions (or [[dysplasia]]s) is believed highly likely to result in the prevention of those cancers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108666.htm |title=FDA Licenses New Vaccine for Prevention of Cervical Cancer and Other Diseases in Females Caused by Human Papillomavirus |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|date=2006-06-08 |accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref>

==History==
In work that was initiated in the mid 1980s, the vaccine was developed, in parallel, by researchers at [[Georgetown University]] Medical Center, the [[University of Rochester]], the [[University of Queensland]] in Australia, and the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]].<ref>{{cite journal

[[Harald zur Hausen]], a German researcher who initially suspected and later helped to prove that genital HPV infection can lead to cervical cancer, was awarded half of the $1.4 million [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for his work. Verification that cervical cancer is caused by an infectious agent led several other groups (see above) to develop vaccines against HPV strains that cause most cases of cervical cancer. The other half of the award went to [[Francoise Barre-Sinoussi]] and [[Luc Montagnier]], two French virologists, for their part in the discovery of HIV.<ref name="CDC-HPV-Fact"/>

zur Hausen went against current dogma and postulated that oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) caused cervical cancer.<ref name=CDC-HPV/> He realized that HPV-DNA could exist in a non-productive state in the tumours, and should be detectable by specific searches for viral DNA.<ref name="CDC-HPV-Fact"/> He and others, notably workers at the [[Pasteur Institute]], found HPV to be a heterogeneous family of viruses. Only some HPV types cause cancer.<ref name=CDC-HPV/>

Harald zur Hausen pursued his idea of HPV for over 10 years by searching for different HPV types. [3] This research was difficult due to the fact that only parts of the viral DNA were integrated into the host genome. He found novel HPV-DNA in cervix cancer biopsies, and thus discovered the new, tumourigenic HPV16 type in 1983. In 1984, he cloned HPV16 and 18 from patients with cervical cancer.<ref name="CDC-HPV-Fact"/> The HPV types 16 and 18 were consistently found in about 70% of cervical cancer biopsies throughout the world.<ref name=CDC-HPV/>

His observation of HPV oncogenic potential in human malignancy provided impetus within the research community to characterize the natural history of HPV infection, and to develop a better understanding of mechanisms of HPV-induced carcinogenesis.<ref name=CDC-HPV/>

There is also substantial research interest in the development of [[therapeutic vaccine]]s, which seek to elicit immune responses against established HPV infections and HPV-induced cancers.

===Therapeutic HPV vaccines===
In addition to preventive vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, laboratory research and several human clinical trials are focused on the development of therapeutic HPV vaccines. HPV-associated diseases have become an ideal test of antigen-specific immunotherapy due to the expression of viral oncoproteins that provide tumour-specific non-self antigenic targets.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The relative accessibility of the lower genital tract makes it easier to study the effect of therapeutic vaccines on the systemic circulation and the target tissue.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In general these vaccines focus on the main HPV [[oncogenes]], E6 and E7. Since expression of E6 and E7 is required for promoting the growth of cervical cancer cells (and cells within warts), it is hoped that immune responses against the two oncogenes might eradicate established [[tumor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roden RB, Ling M, Wu TC |title=Vaccination to prevent and treat cervical cancer |journal=Human pathology |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages = 971–82 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15297964 |doi=10.1016/j.humpath.2004.04.007 |url=}}</ref>

==Vaccine implementation==
{{Main| Vaccination policy}}

In developed countries, the widespread use of cervical "[[Pap smear]]" screening programs has reduced the incidence of invasive cervical cancer by 50% or more. Current preventive vaccines reduce, but do not eliminate the chance of getting cervical cancer. Therefore, experts recommend that women combine the benefits of both programs by seeking regular Pap smear screening, even after vaccination.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Bull World Health Organ |year=2007 |volume=85 |issue=9 |pages = 719–26 |title= Human papillomavirus and HPV vaccines: a review |author= Cutts FT, Franceschi S, Goldie S |pmid=18026629 |url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0042-96862007000900018&lng=en&nrm=iso |doi= 10.2471/BLT.06.038414 |pmc= 2636411}}</ref> The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has recommended all European teenage girls to be vaccinated however Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Turkey currently do not have a vaccination programme in place.

===Australia===
In April 2007, Australia became the first country to introduce a government funded National Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Program to protect young women against HPV infections that can lead to cancers and disease.<ref name="HPV Prevalence"> Tabrizi S. Brotherton J. Kaldor J et al. Fall in Human Papillomavirus Prevalence Following a National Vaccination Program. Journal of Infectious Diseases. October 24, 2012. </ref> The National HPV Vaccination Program is listed on the National Immunisation Program (NIP) Schedule and funded under the Immunise Australia Program.<ref name="Information about the program">  [http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/about-the-program], [http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/about-the-program Immuinise Australia: Information about the HPV immunisation program] </ref> The Immunise Australia Program is a joint Australian, State and Territory Government initiative to increase immunisation rates for vaccine preventable diseases.

The National HPV Vaccination Program for females was made up of two components: an ongoing school-based program for 12-13 year old girls; and a time-limited catch-up program (females aged 14 – 26 years) delivered through schools, general practices and community immunisation services, which ceased on 31 December 2009.

During 2007-2009, an estimated 83% of females aged 12-17 years received at least one dose of HPV vaccine and 70% completed the 3-dose HPV vaccination course.<ref name="HPV Prevalence" /> Latest HPV coverage data on the Immunise Australia website show that by 15 years of age, over 70% of Australian females have received all three doses. This has remained steady since 2009.<ref name="Immunise HPV">[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/immunise-hpv], [http://www.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/immunise-hpv Immunise Australia HPV].</ref> 

Since the National HPV Vaccination Program commenced in 2007, there has been a reduction in HPV-related infections in young women. A study published in The Journal of Infectious Disease in October 2012 found the prevalence of vaccine preventable HPV types (6, 11, 16 and 18) in Papanicolaou test results of women aged 18-24 years  has significantly decreased from 28.7% to 6.7% four years after the introduction of the National HPV Vaccination Program.<ref name="HPV Prevalence" /> A separate report published in the Kirby Institute’s Annual Surveillance Report 2011 (page 28) found the diagnosis of genital warts (caused by HPV types 6 and 11) had also decreased in young women and men.<ref name="Kirby Report">[http://www.kirby.unsw.edu.au/surveillance/2011-annual-surveillance-report-hiv-viral-hepatitis-stis" ], [http://www.kirby.unsw.edu.au/surveillance/2011-annual-surveillance-report-hiv-viral-hepatitis-stis 2011 Annual Surveillance Report of HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs].</ref> 

In October 2010, the Australian regulatory agency, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, extended the registration of the quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil) to include use in males aged 9 through 26 years of age, for the prevention of external genital lesions and infection with HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.

In November 2011, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) recommended the extension of the National HPV Vaccination Program to include males. The PBAC made its recommendation on the preventative health benefits that can be achieved, such as a reduction in the incidence of anal and penile cancers and other HPV-related disease. In addition to the direct benefit to males, it was estimated that routine HPV vaccination of adolescent males would contribute to the reduction of vaccine HPV-type infection and associated disease in women through herd immunity.<ref name="Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme">[http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/pbac-outcomes/2011-11], [http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/pbac-outcomes/2011-11 Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Recommendations].</ref>

On 12 July 2012, the Australian Government announced funding to extend the National HPV Vaccination Program to include males, with implementation commencing in all states and territories in February 2013.<ref name="Announcement">[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/mr-yr12-tp-tp059.htm?OpenDocument&yr=2012&mth=07], [http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/mr-yr12-tp-tp059.htm?OpenDocument&yr=2012&mth=07 Minister Plibersek announces HPV vaccination for boys].</ref>

From February 2013, free HPV vaccine is being provided through school-based programs for:

* males and females aged 12-13 years (ongoing program); and
* males aged between 14-15 years – until the end of the school year in 2014 (catch up program).

HPV vaccination with Cervarix was introduced into the national immunisation programme in September 2008, for girls aged 12–13 across the UK. A two-year catch up campaign started in Autumn 2009 to vaccinate all girls up to 18 years of age. Catch up vaccination will be offered to:
* girls aged between 16 and 18 from autumn 2009, and
* girls aged between 15 and 17 from autumn 2010.

By the end of the catch up campaign, all girls under 18 will have been offered the HPV vaccine.

From September 2012, Gardasil will replace Cervarix as the HPV vaccination of choice due to its added protection against genital warts.

It will be many years before the vaccination programme has an effect upon cervical cancer incidence so women are advised to continue accepting their invitations for cervical screening.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/cervical/index.html | title = NHS Cervical Screening Program | accessdate = 2008-06-26}}</ref>

===United States===
The cost of HPV vaccine for females under 18 who are uninsured is covered under the federal [[Vaccines for Children Program]].

{{As of|2007|alt=As of late 2007}}, about one quarter of US females age 13–17 years had received at least one of the three HPV shots.<ref>{{cite news|title=1 in 4 US teen girls got cervical cancer shot| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/09/AR2008100901452.html?sub=new| accessdate=2008-10-12 | work=The Washington Post}}{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref>

According to the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), getting as many girls vaccinated as early and as quickly as possible will reduce the cases of cervical cancer among middle-aged women in 30 to 40 years and reduce the transmission of this highly communicable infection. Barriers include the limited understanding by many people that HPV causes cervical cancer, the difficulty of getting pre-teens and teens into the doctor's office to get a shot, and the high cost of the vaccine ($120/dose, $360 total for the three required doses, plus the cost of doctor visits).<ref name=pmid_17380109 /><ref name=CDC:STDfactsheet />

A survey was conducted in 2009 to gather information about knowledge and adoption of the HPV vaccine. Thirty percent of 13- to 17-year-olds and 9% of 18- to 26-year-olds out of the total 1,011 young women surveyed reported receipt of at least one HPV injection. Knowledge about HPV varied; however, 5% or fewer subjects believed that the HPV vaccine precluded the need for regular cervical cancer screening or safe-sex practices. Few girls and young women overestimate the protection provided by the vaccine. Despite moderate uptake, many females at risk of acquiring HPV have not yet received the vaccine.<ref name=caskey>{{cite journal|last=Caskey|first=R|coauthors=Lindau ST, Alexander GC|title=Knowledge and early adoption of the HPV vaccine among girls and young women: results of a national survey|journal=The Journal of Adolescent Health|year=2009|month=November|volume=45|issue=5|pages=453–462|pmid=19837351|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=19837351|accessdate=11/10/2011|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.04.021}}</ref>

====Legislation====
Shortly after the first HPV vaccine was approved, bills to include the vaccine among those that are mandatory for school attendance were introduced in many states.<ref name=Schwartz>{{cite journal| journal = American Journal of Public Health | author = Schwartz | title = HPV Vaccination's Second Act: Promotion, Competition, and Compulsion | date = 2010 October | volume = 100| pmid = 20724671 | issue = 10| pages = 1841–4 | doi=10.2105/AJPH.2010.193060 }}</ref> Only two such bills passed (in Virginia and Washington DC) during the first four years after vaccine introduction.<ref name=Schwartz /> Mandates have been effective at increasing uptake of other vaccines, such as mumps, measles, rubella, and hepatitis B (which is also sexually transmitted).<ref name=CDC:STDfactsheet>{{cite web | url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/STDFact-HPV-vaccine-young-women.htm |title=HPV Vaccine Information For Young Women|publisher= [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |accessdate=2009-06-14}}</ref> However most such efforts developed for five or more years after vaccine release, while financing and supply were arranged, further safety data was gathered, and education efforts increased understanding, before mandates were considered.<ref name=Schwartz />

Other measures that have been considered include requiring insurers to cover HPV vaccination, and funding HPV vaccines for those without insurance.

=====Opt-out policies=====
Almost all pieces of legislation currently pending in the states that would make the vaccine mandatory for school entrance have an "[[opt-out]]" policy.<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/HPVvaccine.htm HPV Vaccine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=====Immigrants=====
Between July 2008 and December 2009, proof of the first of three doses of HPV Gardasil vaccine was required for women ages 11–26 intending to legally enter the United States.   This requirement stirred controversy because of the cost of the vaccine, and because all the other vaccines so required prevent diseases which are spread by respiratory route and considered highly contagious.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gardasil Requirement for Immigrants Stirs Backlash|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122282354408892791.html?|accessdate=2009-01-15|author=MIRIAM JORDAN|work=The Wall Street Journal | date=2008-10-01}}</ref> The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] repealed all HPV vaccination directives for immigrants effective December 14, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Green card seekers won't have to get HPV vaccine|url=http://www.nwcn.com/news/national/70217772.html|accessdate=2011-01-31| date=2009-11-16}}</ref>

However, Medicaid covers HPV vaccination in accordance with the ACIP recommendations, and immunizations are a mandatory service under Medicaid for eligible individuals under age 21. [1] In addition, Medicaid includes the Vaccines for Children Program. [1] This program provides immunization services for children 18 and under who are Medicaid eligible, uninsured, underinsured, receiving immunizations through a Federally Qualified Health Center or Rural Health Clinic, or are Native American or Alaska Native.[1]

The vaccine manufacturers also offer help for people who cannot afford HPV vaccination. GSK has the Vaccines Access Program, which provides Cervarix free of charge to women who do not have insurance and who have a low income, and who are ages 19 to 25 and therefore too old for the Medicaid Vaccines for Children Program. [1] For example, Merck offers the Merck Vaccine Patient Assistance Program, which provides Gardasil for free to people over the age of 19 who do not have health insurance or cannot afford to pay for the vaccine. [1]

=====Religious right and conservative groups=====
Several conservative{{Who|date=July 2012}}{{Quantify|date=July 2012}} groups in the U.S. have publicly opposed the concept of making HPV vaccination mandatory for pre-adolescent girls, asserting that making the vaccine mandatory is a violation of parental rights. They also say that it will lead to early sexual activity, giving a false sense of immunity to sexually transmitted disease. (See [[Peltzman effect]]) Both the [[Family Research Council]] and the group [[Focus on the Family]] support widespread (universal) availability of HPV vaccines but oppose mandatory HPV vaccinations for entry to public school.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/14/AR2006071401532.html |title=Pro-Family, Pro-Vaccine — But Keep It Voluntary| last=Sprigg |first=Peter |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2006-07-15 |accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://newstandardnews.net/content/index.cfm/items/2552 |title=Cervical Cancer Vaccine Raises 'Promiscuity' Controversy |author=Coyne, Brendan |work=[[The New Standard]] |accessdate=2006-08-28 |date=2005-11-02}}</ref><ref>[http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=IF07B01 Family Research Council: Thursday, February 7, 2008 "IF07B01"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.family.org/socialissues/A000000357.cfm Focus on the Family Position Statement: Human Papillomavirus Vaccines<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Many organizations{{Who|date=July 2010}}{{Quantify|date=July 2010}} disagree with the argument that the vaccine increases sexual activity among teens. Dr. Christine Peterson, director of the University of Virginia's Gynecology Clinic, said "The presence of seat belts in cars doesn't cause people to drive less safely. The presence of a vaccine in a person's body doesn't cause them to engage in risk-taking behavior they would not otherwise engage in."<ref>"Lifesaving Politics." Ms. Magazine. pp 12–13.
