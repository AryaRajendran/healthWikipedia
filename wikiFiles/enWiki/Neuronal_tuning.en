'''Neuronal tuning''' refers to the property of brain cells by which they selectively represent a particular type of sensory, motor, or cognitive information. Neuronal responses are optimally tuned to specific patterns through experience.<ref>Sakai, Kuniyoshi; Miyashita, Yasushi. Neuronal tuning to learned complex forms in vision. ''NeuroReport'' 1994, 5:829-832.</ref> Neuronal tuning can be strong and sharp, as observed in [[primary visual cortex]] (area V1), or weak and broad, as observed in [[neural ensemble]]s. Single neurons may be simultaneously tuned to several modalities, such as visual, auditory, and olfactory. Neurons that are tuned to different signals often integrate information from the different sources. In [[neural network]]s, such integration is the major principle of operation. The best examples of neuronal tuning can be seen in the visual, auditory, olfactory, somatosensory, and memory systems.

== Visually Tuned System ==
Accepted neuronal tuning models suggest that [[neuron]]s respond to different degrees based on the similarity between the optimal stimulus of the neuron and the given stimulus.<ref>Grill-Spector, Kalanit; Witthoft, Nathan. Deos the Bairn Not Raed Ervey Lteter by Istlef, but the Wrod as a Wlohe? ''Neuron'' 2009, 62:161-162.</ref> The first major evidence of neuronal tuning in the visual system was provided by [[Hubel]] and [[Wiesel]] in 1959.<ref name="hubel">Hubel, D. H.; Wiesel, T. N. Receptive Fields of Single Neurones in the Cat's Striate Cortex. ''J. Physiol.'' 1959, 148:574-591.</ref> They discovered that oriented slits of light were the most effective stimuli for striate cortex “[[simple cell]]” neurons.<ref>Wurtz, Robert H. Recounting the impact of Hubel and Wiesel. ''J. Physiol.'' 2009, 587:2817-2823.</ref> Other neurons, “[[complex cell]]s," responded best to lines of a certain orientation moving in a specific direction.<ref name="hubel" /> Overall, the V1 neurons were found to be selectively tuned to a certain orientations, sizes, positions, and forms.<ref name="hubel" /> Hubel and Wiesel won the [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/ Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine] in 1981 for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system.<ref>[http://www.nobelprize.org www.nobelprize.org]</ref>

While these simple cells in V1 respond to oriented bars through small [[receptive field]]s, the optimal visual stimulus becomes increasing complex as one moves toward the anterior of the brain.<ref name ="ries">Riesenhuber, Maximilian; Poggio, Tomaso. Neural mechanisms of object recognition. ''Current Opinion in Neurobiology'' 2002, 12:162-168.</ref> Neurons in [[visual cortex|area V4]] are selectively tuned to different wavelengths, hues, and saturations of color.<ref name ="book">Kolb, B.; Whishaw, I. Q. Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology (2003). New York, NY: Worth Publishers.</ref> The [[Visual cortex|middle temporal]] or [[Visual cortex|area V5]] is specifically tuned to the speed and direction of moving stimuli.<ref name ="book" /> At the apex of the ventral stream called the [[Inferior temporal gyrus|inferotemporal cortex]], neurons became tuned to complex stimuli, such as faces.<ref name ="ries" /> The specific tuning of intermediate neurons in the [[ventral stream]] is less clear, because the range of form variety that can be utilized for probing is nearly infinite.<ref name ="sakai">Sakai, K.; Naya, Y.; Miyashita, Y. Neuronal tuning and associative mechanisms in form representation. ''Learning and Memory'' 1994, 1:83-105.</ref> 

In the anterior part of the [[ventral stream]], various regions appear to be tuned selectively to identify body parts ([[extrastriate body area]]), faces ([[fusiform face area]]), moving bodies ([[Superior temporal sulcus|posterior superior temporal sulcus]]), or even scenes ([[parahippocampal place area]]).<ref name ="book" /> Neuronal tuning in these areas requires fine discrimination among complex patterns in each relevant category for [[object recognition]].<ref name ="sakai" /> Recent findings suggest that this fine discrimination is a function of [[expertise]] and the individual [[categorization|level of categorization]] with stimuli. Specifically, work has been done by Gauthier ''et al'' (2001) to show [[fusiform face area]] (FFA) activation for birds in bird experts and cars in car experts when compared to the opposing stimuli.<ref>Gauthier, I.; Skudlarski, P.; Gore, J. C.; Anderson, A. W. Expertise for cars and birds recruits brain areas involved in face recognition. ''Nat. Neurosci.'' 2001, 3:191-197.</ref> Gauthier ''et al'' (2002) also utilized a new class of objects called [[Greeble (psychology)|Greebles]] and trained people to recognize them at individual levels.<ref name ="gauth" /> After training, the [[Fusiform face area|FFA]] was tuned to distinguish between this class of objects as well as faces.<ref name ="gauth">Gauthier, I.; Tarr, M. J. Unraveling mechanisms for expert object recognition: Bridging brain activity and behavior. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance'' 2002, 28(2):431-446.</ref> Curran ''et al'' (2002) similarly trained people in a less structured class of objects called "blobs" and showed [[Fusiform face area|FFA]] selective activation for them.<ref>Curran, I.; Tanaka, J.; Weiskopf, D. An electrophysiological comparison of visual categorization and recognition memory. ''Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioral Neuroscience'' 2002, 18(2):1-18.</ref> Overall, neurons can be tuned selectively discriminate between certain sets of stimuli that are experienced regularly in the world.

== Tuning in Other Systems ==
[[Neuron]]s in other systems also become selectively tuned to stimuli. In the [[auditory system]], different neurons may respond selectively to the frequency (pitch), amplitude (loudness), and/or complexity (uniqueness) of sounds.<ref name ="book" /> In the [[olfactory system]], neurons may be tuned to certain kinds of smells.<ref name ="book" /> In the [[gustatory system]], different neurons may respond selectively to different components of food: sweet, sour, salty, and bitter.<ref name ="book" /> In the [[somatosensory system]], neurons may be selectively tuned to different types of pressure, temperature, bodily position, and pain.<ref name ="book" /> This tuning in the [[somatosensory system]] also provides feedback to the [[motor system]] so that it may selectively tune neurons to respond in specific ways to given stimuli.<ref name ="book" /> Finally, the encoding and storage of information in both [[Short-term memory|short-term]] and [[Long-term memory|long-term]] memory requires the tuning of neurons in complex ways such that information may be later retrieved.<ref name ="book" />
