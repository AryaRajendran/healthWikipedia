|author=Medical Dictionary|title=Definition|accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref> is a [[drug delivery device]] used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs.
[[File:Jet nebulizer.jpg|thumb|A modern jet nebulizer in use]]

Nebulizers are commonly used for the treatment of [[cystic fibrosis]], [[asthma]], [[COPD]] and other [[respiratory disease]]s. 

[[Analytical Nebulizers]] are another form of nebulizer and are used primarily in laboratory settings for elemental analysis.

Nebulizers use [[oxygen]], [[compressed air]] or [[ultrasonics|ultrasonic]] power to break up medical solutions and suspensions into small [[aerosol]] droplets that can be directly inhaled from the mouthpiece of the device. The definition of an aerosol is a "mixture of gas and liquid particles," and the best example of a naturally occurring aerosol is [[mist]], formed when small vaporized water particles mixed with hot ambient air are cooled down and condense into a fine cloud of visible airborne water droplets.

==Aerosol deposition==
The lung deposition characteristics and efficacy of an aerosol depend largely on the particle or droplet size. Generally, the smaller the particle the greater its chance of peripheral penetration and retention. However, for very fine particles below 0.5 µm in diameter there is a chance of avoiding deposition altogether and being exhaled. In 1966 the Task Group on Lung Dynamics, concerned mainly with the hazards of inhalation of environmental toxins, proposed a model for deposition of particles in the lung. This suggested that particles of more than 10 µm in diameter are most likely to deposit in the mouth and throat, for those of 5–10 µm diameter a transition from mouth to airway deposition occurs, and particles smaller than 5 µm in diameter deposit more frequently in the lower airways and are appropriate for pharmaceutical aerosols.<ref>The science of nebulised drug delivery, p6</ref>

==Types of nebulizers==

===Mechanical===

====Home made====
A nebulizer can be made at home with a sealed bottle that can be safely pumped to a moderately high air pressure. A plug is made by drilling a hole through a cork and inserting a ball inflating needle connected to a bicycle pump. A small amount of volatile liquid, such as alcohol, is placed in the bottle and the cork and bicycle pump apparatus is used to increase the pressure in the bottle. When the cork is removed, the rapid change in air pressure will vaporize the liquid.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs2CjmOvqSA</ref> The same effect can be achieved using less volatile substances such as water, although vaporization occurs to a lesser extent.

====Soft Mist Inhaler====
The medical company [[Boehringer Ingelheim]] also invented a new device named Respimat '''Soft Mist Inhaler''' in 1997. This new technology provides a metered dose to the user, as the liquid bottom of the inhaler is rotated clockwise 180 degrees by hand, adding a build up tension into a spring around the flexible liquid container. When the user activates the bottom of the inhaler, the energy from the spring is released and imposes pressure on the flexible liquid container, causing liquid to spray out of 2 nozzles, thus forming a soft mist to be inhaled. The device features no gas propellant and no need for battery/power to operate. The average droplet size in the mist was measured to a somewhat disappointing 5.8 micrometers, which could indicate some potential efficiency problems for the inhaled medicine to reach the lungs. Subsequent trials have proven this was not the case. Due to the very low velocity of the mist, the Soft Mist Inhaler in fact has a higher efficiency compared to a conventional pMDI.<ref name="Soft Mist Inhaler">{{cite web|url=http://www.respimat.com/com/Main/functions/howitworks/index.jsp|author=Boehringer Ingelheim|title=How it works: Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler|year=2003|accessdate=2005-08-16}}</ref> In 2000, arguments were launched towards the European Respiratory Society (ERS) to clarify/expand their definition of a nebulizer, as the new Soft Mist Inhaler in technical terms both could be classified as a "hand driven nebulizer" and a "hand driven pMDI".<ref name="Soft Mist Inhaler definition">{{cite journal |journal=Eur Respir Rev |volume=10 |pages=187–191 |author=Denyer J, ''et al.'' |title=New liquid drug aerosol devices for inhalation therapy |year=2000}}</ref>

====Human Powered Nebulizer (HPN)====
The most recent innovation in nebulizer technology is the human-powered nebulizer being developed by Dr. Lars E. Olson of Marquette University.

The human-powered nebulizer (HPN) is designed to provide relief to patients suffering from respiratory diseases such as asthma, TB, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in areas with limited access to electricity. Invented in 2009 by a team of doctors from Marquette University, HPN uses a bicycle frame and pedals—each connected to a piston and some tubing—to turn liquid medicine into mist that flows directly into a patient's lungs through an attached mouthpiece. Commercial nebulizers typically use an electric compressor to maintain their rate of airflow, but with HPN, healthcare workers achieve the same goal by pedaling the equivalent of 8 miles per hour.<ref>http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/green-energy/7-ways-pedal-power-will-change-the-world-6#slide-6</ref>

===Electrical===

====Vibrating Mesh Technology (VMT)====
A new significant innovation was made in the nebulizer market around 2005, with creation of the ultrasonic Vibrating Mesh Technology (VMT). With this technology a mesh/membrane with 1000-7000 laser drilled holes vibrates at the top of the liquid reservoir, and thereby pressures out a mist of very fine droplets through the holes. This technology is more efficient than having a vibrating piezoelectric element at the bottom of the liquid reservoir, and thereby shorter treatment times are also achieved. The old problems found with the ultrasonic wave nebulizer, having too much liquid waste and undesired heating of the medical liquid, have also been solved by the new '''Vibrating Mesh nebulizers'''. A partial list of available VMT nebulizers includes: Pari eFlow,<ref name="VMT1">{{cite web|url=http://www.paripharma.com/technologies1.htm|author=PARI Pharma|title=Leading aerosol therapies worldwide, delivery with eFlow|year=2008|accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref> [[Respironics]] i-Neb,<ref name="VMT2">{{cite web|url=http://ineb.respironics.com/AADHow.asp|author=Philips Respironics|title=Active Aerosol Dilevery, The I-neb and Vibrating Mesh Technology|year=2010|accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref> [[Omron]] MicroAir,<ref name="VMT3">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcare.omron.co.jp/english/neu_method.html|author=Omron|title=Talking about nebulization method: Ultrasonic nebulizer and Vibrating Mesh nebulizer|year=2010|accessdate=2010-04-09}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Beurer Nebulizer IH50,<ref name="VMT4">{{cite web|url=http://www.beurer.com/web/en/product/nebulization/detail.php?pk=31&id=5707&bek=165&bct=%26nbsp%3B%26gt%3B%26nbsp%3Bproduct+details%26nbsp%3B%26gt%3B%26nbsp%3BIH50|author=Beurer|title=Product details of IH50 nebulizer, with a vibrating membrane|year=2010|accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref> and Aerogen Aeroneb.<ref name="VMT5">{{cite web|url=http://aerogen.com/technology.html|author=Aerogen|title=Micropump nebulizers, Aeroneb, Vibrating Mesh Technology|year=2009|accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref> As the price of the ultrasonic VMT nebulizers carry a higher price compared to the previous models, most of the manufacturers continue also to sell the more "old fashioned" Jet nebulizer.

====Jet nebulizer====
The most commonly used nebulizers are '''Jet nebulizers''', which are also called "atomizers".<ref name=Finlay>{{cite book |author=Finlay, W.H. |title=The Mechanics of Inhaled Pharmaceutical Aerosols: An Introduction |publisher=Academic Press |location= |year=2001 }}</ref> Jet nebulizers are connected by tubing to a [[gas compressor|compressor]], that causes [[compressed air]] or [[oxygen]] to flow at high velocity through a liquid medicine to turn it into an [[aerosol]], which is then inhaled by the patient. Currently there seems to be a tendency among physicians to prefer prescription of a [[pressurized Metered Dose Inhaler]] (pMDI) for their patients, instead of a Jet nebulizer that generates a lot more noise (often 60dB during use) and is less portable due to a heavier weight. However Jet nebulizers are commonly used for patients in hospitals who have difficulty using inhalers, such as in serious cases of respiratory disease, or severe asthma attacks.<ref name=Hickey>{{cite book |author=Hickey, A.J. |title=Pharmaceutical Inhalation Aerosol Technology |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York |year=2004 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The main advantage of the Jet nebulizer is related to its low operational cost. If the patient needs to inhale medicine on a daily basis the use of a pMDI can be rather expensive. Today several manufacturers have also managed to lower the weight of the Jet nebulizer down to {{convert|635|g}}, and thereby started to label it as a portable device. Compared to all the competing inhalers and nebulizers, the noise and heavy weight is however still the biggest draw back of the Jet nebulizer. 

====Ultrasonic wave nebulizer====
'''Ultrasonic wave nebulizers''' were invented in 1964 as a new more portable nebulizer. The technology inside an ultrasonic wave nebulizer is to have an [[electronic oscillator]] generate a high frequency [[ultrasonic wave]], which causes the mechanical vibration of a [[piezoelectric]] element. This vibrating element is in contact with a liquid reservoir and its high frequency vibration is sufficient to produce a vapor mist.<ref name="Ultrasonic humidifier">{{cite web|url=http://www.airwin-luftbefeuchter.de/html/en/operating_principle.html|author=BOGA Gmbh|title=Operating principle of ultrasonic humidifier|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> As they create aerosols from ultrasonic vibration instead of using a heavy air compressor, they only have a weight around {{convert|170|g}}. Another advantage is that the ultrasonic vibration is almost silent. Examples of these more modern type of nebulizers are: [[Omron]] NE-U17 and Beurer Nebulizer IH30.<ref>{{cite book |author=Knoch, M.; Finlay, W.H. |chapter=Ch. 71 Nebuliser Technologies |editor=Rathbone, Hadgraft, Roberts |title=Modified-Release Drug Delivery Technology |publisher=Marcel Dekker |year=2002 |pages=849–856 }}</ref>

==Use and attachments==
Nebulizers accept their medicine in the form of a liquid solution, which is often loaded into the device upon use. [[Corticosteroids]] and [[Bronchodilator]]s such as [[salbutamol]] (''albuterol'' [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) are often used, and sometimes in combination with [[ipratropium]]. The reason these pharmaceuticals are inhaled instead of ingested is in order to target their effect to the [[respiratory tract]], which speeds onset of action of the medicine and reduces side effects, compared to other alternative intake routes.<ref name=Hickey /> 

Usually, the aerosolized medicine is inhaled through a tube-like mouthpiece, similar to that of an [[inhaler]]. The mouthpiece, however, is sometimes replaced with a face mask, similar to that used for inhaled [[anesthesia]], for ease of use with young children or the elderly. Pediatric masks are often shaped liked animals such as fish, dogs or dragons to make children less resistant to nebulizer treatments. Many nebulizer manufacturers also offer pacifier attachments for infants and toddlers.<ref>Just Nebulizers (2012) http://justnebulizers.com/breathing-treatments-and-kids/. Retrieved 07-16-2012</ref> But mouthpieces are preferable if patients are able to use them since face-masks result in reduced lung delivery because of aerosol losses in the nose.<ref name=Finlay />

After use with corticosteroid, it is theoretically possible for patients to develop a [[yeast infection]] in the mouth ([[Oral candidiasis|thrush]]) or hoarseness of voice ([[dysphonia]]), although these conditions are clinically very rare. To avoid these adverse effects, some clinicians suggest that the person who used the nebulizer should rinse his or her mouth. This is not true for bronchodilators; however, patients may still wish to rinse their mouths due to the unpleasant taste of some bronchodilating drugs.

==Nebulizer use by those with asthma==

===Guidelines===
Various asthma guidelines, such as the Global Initiative for Asthma Guidelines [GINA], the British Guidelines on the management of Asthma, The Canadian Pediatric Asthma Consensus Guidelines, and United States Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthma each recommend metered dose inhalers in place of nebulizer-delivered therapies.<ref name=Clark2010>{{cite journal |author=Clark NM, Houle C, Partridge MR, Leo HL, Paton JY |title=The puzzle of continued use of nebulized therapy by those with asthma |journal=Chron Respir Dis |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=3–7 |year=2010 |pmid=20103617 |doi=10.1177/1479972309357496 |url=http://crd.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=20103617}}</ref>
The European Respiratory Society acknowledge that although nebulizers are used in hospitals and at home they suggest much of this use may not be evidence-based.<ref name=Boe2001>{{cite journal |author=Boe J, Dennis JH, O'Driscoll BR, ''et al.'' |title=European Respiratory Society Guidelines on the use of nebulizers |journal=Eur. Respir. J. |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=228–42 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11510796 |url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11510796}}</ref>

===Effectiveness===
Recent evidence show that nebulizers are no more effective than [[metered-dose inhaler]]s (MDIs) with spacers and that MDIs may offer advantages in children with acute asthma.<ref name=Clark2010/><ref name=Cates2006>{{cite journal |author=Cates CJ, Crilly JA, Rowe BH |title=Holding chambers (spacers) versus nebulisers for beta-agonist treatment of acute asthma |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000052 |year=2006 |pmid=16625527 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000052.pub2 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000052.pub2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Epling J, Chang MH |title=Are metered-dose inhalers with holding chambers better than nebulizers for treating acute asthma? |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=62–4 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12537167 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=12537167}}</ref> Those findings refer specifically to the treatment of asthma and not to the efficacy of nebulisers generally, as for COPD for example.

European Respiratory Society highlighted a risk relating to dosage reproducibility caused by selling nebulizer devices separately from nebulized solution. They found this practice could vary dosages 10-fold or more by changing from an inefficient nebulizer system to a highly efficient one.<ref name=Boe2001/><ref name=Cates2006/>
Two advantages attributed to nebulizers, compared to MDIs with spacers(inhalers), were their ability to deliver larger dosages at a faster rate, especially in acute asthma; however, recent data suggests actual lung deposition rates are the same. In addition, another trial found that a MDI (with spacer) — had a lower required dose for clinical result — compared to a nebulizer (see Clark, et al. other references).<ref name=Clark2010/>

==History==
[[Image:Sales-Girons (1858).jpg|thumb|left|160px|Sales-Girons pressurized nebulizer from 1858.]]
The first "powered" or pressurized inhaler was invented in France by Sales-Girons in 1858. This device used pressure to atomize the liquid medication. The pump handle is operated like a bicycle pump. When the pump is pulled up, it draws liquid from the reservoir, and upon the force of the user's hand, the liquid is pressurized through an atomizer, to be sprayed out for inhalation near the user's mouth.<ref name="Sales-Girons">{{cite web|url=http://www.inhalatorium.com/page148.html|author=Inhalatorium|title=Pressurized inhaler invented by Sales-Girons|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref>

In 1864, the first steam-driven nebulizer was invented in Germany. This inhaler, known as "Siegle’s steam spray inhaler", used the [[Venturi principle]] to atomize liquid medication, and this was the very beginning of nebulizer therapy. The importance of droplet size was not yet understood, so the efficacy of this first device was unfortunately mediocre for many of the medical compounds. The Siegle steam spray inhaler consisted of a spirit burner, which boiled water in the reservoir into steam that could then flow across the top and into a tube suspended in the pharmaceutical solution. The passage of steam drew the medicine into the vapor, and the patient inhaled this vapor through a mouthpiece made of glass.<ref name="Siegle">{{cite web|url= http://www.inhalatorium.com/page113.html|author=Inhalatorium|title=Siegle's steam spray inhaler|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref>

The first electrical nebulizer was invented in the 1930s and called a Pneumostat. With this device, a medical liquid (typically [[adrenalin chloride]], used as a bronchial muscle relaxant to reverse contriction) was made aerosol by the power from an electrical compressor.<ref name="Pneumostat">{{cite web|url=http://www.inhalatorium.com/page131.html|author=Inhalatorium|title=First electrical nebulizer (Pneumostat)|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> As an alternative to the expensive electrical nebulizer, many people in the 1930s continued to use the much more simple and cheap hand-driven nebulizer, known as the Parke-Davis Glaseptic.<ref name="Parke-Davis">{{cite web|url=http://www.inhalatorium.com/page90.html|author=Inhalatorium|title=The hand driven nebulizer "Parke-Davis Glaseptic|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref>

In 1956, a technology competing against the nebulizer was launched by Riker Laboratories ([[3M]]), in the form of pressurized [[metered-dose inhaler]]s, with Medihaler-iso ([[isoprenaline]]) and Medihaler-epi ([[Epinephrine|adrenaline]]) as the two first products.<ref name="pMDI patent">{{cite web|url=http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=GB&NR=830426A&KC=A&FT=D&date=19600316&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP|author=Riker Laboratories|title=Self-propelling pharmaceutical compositions (for a pMDI)|work=GB patent|date=1956-03-21|accessdate=1960-03-16}}</ref> In these devices, the drug is cold-fill and delivered in exact doses through some special metering valves, driven by a gas propellant technology (i.e. [[Freon]] or a less environmentally damaging HFA).<ref name="inhalation therapy">{{cite journal |author=Sanders M |title=Inhalation therapy: an historical review |journal=Prim Care Respir J |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=71–81 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17356785 |doi=10.3132/pcrj.2007.00017 |url=http://www.thepcrj.org/journ/vol16/16_2_71_81.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

In 1964, a new type of electronic nebulizer was introduced: the "ultrasonic wave nebulizer".<ref name="Ultrasonic nebulizer patent">{{cite web|url=http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=GB&NR=1069048A&KC=A&FT=D&date=19670517&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_V3|author=Devilbiss|title=Method and apparatus for producing aerosols (ultrasonic nebulizer)|work=GB patent|date=1964-02-10|accessdate=1967-05-17}}</ref> Today the nebulizing technology is not only used for medical purposes. Ultrasonic wave nebulizers are also used in [[humidifier]]s, to spray out water aerosols to moisten dry air in buildings.<ref name="Ultrasonic humidifier"/>

Some of the first models of [[electronic cigarette]]s featured an ultrasonic wave nebulizer (having a [[piezoelectric]] element vibrating and creating high-frequency [[ultrasound]] waves, to cause vibration and atomization of liquid [[nicotine]]) in combination with a [[Humidifier|vapouriser]] (built as a [[spray nozzle]] with an electric [[heating element]]).<ref name="Electronic cigarette patent 2004">{{cite web|url=http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=EP&NR=1736065A1&KC=A1&FT=D&date=20061227&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_V3|author=Hon Lik|title=An aerosol electronic cigarette|work=CN patent|date=2004-04-14|accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref> The most common type of electronic cigarettes currently sold, however, omit the ultrasonic wave nebulizer, as it was not found to be efficient enough for this kind of device. Instead, the electronic cigarettes now use an electric vaporizer, either in direct contact with the absorbent material in the "impregnated atomizer," or in combination with the nebulization technology related to a "spraying jet atomizer" (in the form of liquid droplets being out-sprayed by a high-speed air stream, that passes through some small venturi injection channels, drilled in a material absorbed with nicotine liquid).<ref name="Electronic cigarette patent 2006">{{cite web|url=http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=EP&NR=2022350A1&KC=A1&FT=D&date=20090211&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_V3|author=Hon Lik|title=Emulation aerosol sucker|work=CN patent|date=2006-05-16|accessdate=2009-02-11}}</ref>
