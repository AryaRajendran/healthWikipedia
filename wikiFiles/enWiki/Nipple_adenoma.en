A '''nipple adenoma''' is a rare [[benign]] tumour of the [[breast cancer|breast]].

The condition may also be known as :
:*Florid papillomatosis of the nipple
:*Florid adenomatosis
:*Subareolar duct papillomatosis
:*Erosive adenomatosis<ref name="Sternberg">{{cite book |author=Stoler, Mark A.; Mills, Stacey E.; Carter, Darryl; Joel K Greenson; Reuter, Victor E. |title=Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7942-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Definition==
A nipple adenoma is a type of [[intraductal papilloma]] that arises within the [[lactiferous duct]]s that are located within the [[nipple]].<ref name="Washusurgpath">{{cite book |author=Pfeifer, John D.; Humphrey, Peter A.; Dehner, Louis P. |title=The Washington Manual of surgical pathology |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-6527-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Nipple adenomas most commonly occur in 30- to 40-year old women,<ref name=Sternberg/> but can also occur in men.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tuveri M, Calò PG, Mocci C, Nicolosi A |title=Florid papillomatosis of the male nipple |journal=Am. J. Surg. |volume=200 |issue=3 |pages=e39–40 |year=2010 |month=September |pmid=20409515 |doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2009.10.026 |url=}}</ref>  They can also occur at any age, including in the elderly, in adolescence,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tao W, Kai F, Yue Hua L |title=Nipple adenoma in an adolescent |journal=Pediatr Dermatol |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=399–401 |year=2010 |pmid=20653865 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1470.2010.01176.x |url=}}</ref> and in infants.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clune JE, Kozakewich HP, VanBeek CA, Labow BI, Greene AK |title=Nipple adenoma in infancy |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=2219–22 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19944237 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.08.020 |url=}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Nipple adenomas may be felt as a [[breast lump|lump]] under the nipple or [[areola]]. They may come to attention because of nipple pain, ulceration, swelling or discharge.<ref name=Sternberg/>

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
The [[histology|microscopic]] appearance of a nipple adenoma can be mistaken for [[breast cancer|carcinoma]].<ref name=Sternberg/>  Other conditions that have similar symptoms and signs as nipple adenoma include [[Paget's disease of the breast]], other intraductal papillomas, [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS), [[syringomatous adenoma]] of the nipple and [[subareolar sclerosing duct hyperplasia]].<ref name=Sternberg/>

===Imaging===
Lesions of the nipple and areola, such as nipple adenoma, may be difficult to image clearly on routine [[mammogram]] or [[ultrasonography]]. Nipple adenomas can be imaged using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and conventional or MR ductogram.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sarica O, Zeybek E, Ozturk E |title=Evaluation of nipple-areola complex with ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging |journal=J Comput Assist Tomogr |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=575–86 |year=2010 |month=July |pmid=20657228 |doi=10.1097/RCT.0b013e3181d74a88 |url=}}</ref>

===Biopsy===
Once excised, the [[macroscopic]] appearance of nipple adenomas is of a poorly defined nodular mass. The microscopic appearance can be quite bizarre, and may be misinterpreted as a carcinoma. Nipple adenomas usually have a rounded outline at low magnification, and at higher magnification can be seen to consist of a haphazardly arranged mass of proliferating tubular structures composed of [[epithelium|epithelial]] and [[myoepithelium|myoepithelial]] cells within varying amounts of [[fibroblast|fibrous]] [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]]. The epithelial cells are usually columnar, but the columnar epthelial cells can undergo [[apocrine]] or [[squamous]] [[metaplasia]].  [[Mitosis|Mitotic figures]] and [[necrosis]] are not commonly seen.<ref name=Sternberg/>

==Treatment==
The appropriate treatment in contemporary [[western medicine]] is complete [[surgery|surgical]] excision of the abnormal growth with a small amount of normal surrounding breast tissue.<ref name=Sternberg/>

==Prognosis==
Nipple adenomas are [[benign|non-cancerous]] growths, which can recur if not completely surgically removed.<ref name=Sternberg/>  There are reported cases of cancers arising within nipple adenomas, and following excision of nipple adenomas, but these are rare occurrences.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rao P, Shousha S |title=Male nipple adenoma with DCIS followed 9&nbsp;years later by invasive carcinoma |journal=Breast J |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=317–8 |year=2010 |pmid=20408826 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4741.2010.00900.x |url=}}</ref>
