'''Secondary sclerosing cholangitis''' abbreviated as ('''SSC''') is a disease that is morphologically similar to [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] ([[primary sclerosing cholangitis|PSC]]) but that originates from a known [[pathology|pathological process]]. Its [[Illness|clinical]] and [[cholangiography|cholangiographic]] features may mimic PSC, yet its natural history may be more favorable if recognition is prompt and appropriate therapy is introduced. Thus, the [[diagnosis]] of PSC requires the [[Diagnosis of exclusion|exclusion]] of secondary causes of [[sclerosing cholangitis]] and recognition of associated conditions that may potentially imitate its classic cholangiographic features. Secondary causes of SSC include [[Gallstone|intraductal stone disease]], [[surgical]] or [[blunt trauma|blunt]] [[abdominal trauma]], intra-[[arterial]] [[chemotherapy]], and recurrent [[pancreatitis]].<ref name="pmid17058222">{{cite journal |author=Abdalian R, Heathcote EJ |title=Sclerosing cholangitis: a focus on secondary causes |journal=[[Hepatology]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=1063–74 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17058222 |doi=10.1002/hep.21405 |issn=}}</ref> It has been clearly demonstrated sclerosing cholangitis can develop after an episode of severe bacterial [[cholangitis]].<ref name="pmid12057011">{{cite journal | author = ter Borg PC, van Buuren HR, Depla AC | title = Bacterial cholangitis causing secondary sclerosing cholangitis: a case report | journal = BMC Gastroenterology | volume = 2| pages = 14 | year = 2002 | month = June | pmid = 12057011 | pmc = 116430 | doi = 10.1186/1471-230X-2-14| url = | issn = }}</ref> Also it was suggested that it can result from insult to the biliary tree by obstructive cholangitis secondary to [[choledocholithiasis]], surgical damage, trauma, vascular insults, [[parasitism|parasites]], or congenital fibrocystic disorders.
