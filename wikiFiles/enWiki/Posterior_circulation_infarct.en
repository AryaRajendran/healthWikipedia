A '''Posterior Circulation Infarct''' ('''POCI''') is a type of [[cerebral infarction]] affecting the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[circulatory system|circulation]] supplying one side of the [[brain]].

'''Posterior Circulation Stroke Syndrome''' ('''POCS''') refers to the symptoms of a patient who clinically appears to have suffered from a posterior circulation infarct, but who has not yet had any diagnostic imaging (e.g. [[CT Scan]]) to confirm the diagnosis.

It can cause the following symptoms:
* Cranial nerve palsy AND [[contralateral]] motor/sensory defect
* [[wikt:bilateral|Bilateral]] motor or sensory defect
* Eye movement problems (e.g.[[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]])
* [[Cerebellar]] dysfunction
* Isolated [[homonymous hemianopia]]

It has also been associated with [[deafness]].<ref name="pmid18408371">{{cite journal |author=Lee H |title=Sudden deafness related to posterior circulation infarction in the territory of the nonanterior inferior cerebellar artery: frequency, origin, and vascular topographical pattern |journal=Eur.
