The '''common gamma chain''' (γ<sub>c</sub>) (or CD132), also known as '''interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma''' or '''IL-2RG''', is a [[cytokine receptor]] sub-unit that is common to the receptor complexes for at least six different [[interleukin receptors]]: [[interleukin-2 receptor|IL-2]], [[interleukin-4 receptor|IL-4]],<ref name="pmid8266078">{{cite journal | author = Russell SM, Keegan AD, Harada N, Nakamura Y, Noguchi M, Leland P, Friedmann MC, Miyajima A, Puri RK, Paul WE | title = Interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain: a functional component of the interleukin-4 receptor | journal = Science | volume = 262 | issue = 5141 | pages = 1880–3 | year = 1993 | month = December | pmid = 8266078 | doi = 10.1126/science.8266078 }}</ref> [[interleukin-7 receptor|IL-7]],<ref name="pmid8266077">{{cite journal | author = Noguchi M, Nakamura Y, Russell SM, Ziegler SF, Tsang M, Cao X, Leonard WJ | title = Interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain: a functional component of the interleukin-7 receptor | journal = Science | volume = 262 | issue = 5141 | pages = 1877–80 | year = 1993 | month = December | pmid = 8266077 | doi = 10.1126/science.8266077 }}</ref> [[interleukin-9 receptor|IL-9]], [[interleukin-15 receptor|IL-15]]<ref name="pmid7641685">{{cite journal | author = Giri JG, Kumaki S, Ahdieh M, Friend DJ, Loomis A, Shanebeck K, DuBose R, Cosman D, Park LS, Anderson DM | title = Identification and cloning of a novel IL-15 binding protein that is structurally related to the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 14 | issue = 15 | pages = 3654–63 | year = 1995 | month = August | pmid = 7641685 | pmc = 394440 | doi = }}</ref> and [[interleukin-21 receptor]]. The γ<sub>c</sub> [[glycoprotein]] is a member of the [[type I cytokine receptor]] family expressed on most [[lymphocyte]] (white blood cell) populations, and its gene is found on the [[X-chromosome]] of mammals.

This protein is located on the surface of immature blood-forming cells in [[bone marrow]]. One end of the protein resides outside of the cell where it binds to [[cytokine]]s and the other end of the protein resides in the interior of the cell where it transmits signals to the cell's nucleus. The common gamma chain partners with other proteins to direct blood-forming cells to form [[lymphocyte]]s (a type of white blood cell). The receptor also directs the growth and maturation of lymphocyte subtypes: [[T cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[natural killer cell]]s. These cells kill viruses, make antibodies, and help regulate the entire immune system.

== Gene ==
'''Cytokine receptor common subunit gamma''' also known as '''interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma''' or '''IL-2RG''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''IL2RG'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid1631559">{{cite journal | author = Takeshita T, Asao H, Ohtani K, Ishii N, Kumaki S, Tanaka N, Munakata H, Nakamura M, Sugamura K | title = Cloning of the gamma chain of the human IL-2 receptor | journal = Science | volume = 257 | issue = 5068 | pages = 379–82 | year = 1992 | month = July | pmid = 1631559 | doi = 10.1126/science.1631559| url =  }}</ref> The human IL2RG gene is located on the long (q) arm of the [[X chromosome]] at position 13.1, from [[base pair]] 70,110,279 to base pair 70,114,423.

==Structure==
The γ<sub>c</sub> chain is an [[integral membrane protein]] that contains extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains.

==Function==
Lymphocytes expressing the common gamma chain can form functional receptors for these cytokine proteins, which transmit [[cell signaling|signals]] from one cell to another and direct programs of [[cellular differentiation]].

=== Ligands ===
The γ<sub>c</sub> chain partners with other [[ligand]]-specific receptors to direct lymphocytes to respond to [[cytokine]]s including [[interleukin 2|IL-2]], [[interleukin 4|IL-4]], [[interleukin 7|IL-7]], [[interleukin 9|IL-9]], [[interleukin 15|IL-15]] and [[interleukin 21|IL-21]].<ref name="pmid11418623">{{cite journal | author = Asao H, Okuyama C, Kumaki S, Ishii N, Tsuchiya S, Foster D, Sugamura K | title = Cutting edge: the common gamma-chain is an indispensable subunit of the IL-21 receptor complex | journal = J.

==Clinical significance==

=== X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ===
[[X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency]] is caused by mutations in the IL2RG gene. More than 200 different mutations in the IL2RG gene have been identified in people with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).<ref name="pmid11037300">{{cite journal | author = Vihinen M, Arredondo-Vega FX, Casanova JL, Etzioni A, Giliani S, Hammarström L, Hershfield MS, Heyworth PG, Hsu AP, Lähdesmäki A, Lappalainen I, Notarangelo LD, Puck JM, Reith W, Roos D, Schumacher RF, Schwarz K, Vezzoni P, Villa A, Väliaho J, Smith CI | title = Primary immunodeficiency mutation databases | journal = Adv.

A lack of functional mature lymphocytes disrupts the immune system's ability to protect the body from infection. Sufferers have no functional immunity and can die within months after birth without successful [[bone marrow transplant]]ation or alternatively, isolation from exposure to pathogens. Without important developmental signals from IL-7 and IL-15, [[T-cell]] and [[NK cell]] populations respectively fail to develop.
