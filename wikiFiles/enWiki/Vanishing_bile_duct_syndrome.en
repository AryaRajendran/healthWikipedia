'''Vanishing bile duct syndrome''' is a loose collection of diseases which leads to the injury to hepatic bile ducts and eventual [[ductopenia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reau NS, Jensen DM |title=Vanishing bile duct syndrome |journal=Clin Liver Dis |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=203â€“17, x |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18242505 |doi=10.1016/j.cld.2007.11.007 |url=}}</ref>

==Etiology==

===Congenital/Developmental===
In fetal and neonatal life the ductal plates are remodeled.  The malformations can be atretic or fibrocystic.

====Atretic causes====
*Extrahepatic bile duct atresia

====Fibrocystic causes====
*Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
*Congential hepatic fibrosis
*Caroli's disease
*Von Meyenburg complex

====Chromosomal associations====
*Trisomy 17, 18 and 21

====Genetic associations====
*Cystic fibrosis
*Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
*Trihydroxycoprostanic acidemia
*[[Byler's disease]]

===Immunologic associations===
Bile duct injury and loss can result from autoimmune destruction.  T cells recognize biliary epithelial cell antigens causing injury and eventual atresia.

===Other causes===
*Primary biliary cirrhosis
*Primary sclerosing cholangitis
*Hodgkin's disease
*Chronic graft-versus-host disease
*Drugs/Toxins
*Ischemia

==Clinical presentation==
The presentation is dependant upon the underlying etiology.  The course can be rapid or chronic.
 
===Symptoms===
*Fatigue
*Anorexia
*Abdominal pain
*Weight loss
*Pruritus

===Signs===
*Hyperlipidemia
*Malabsorption
*Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies
*Elevated alkaline phosphatase
*Elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase
*Elevated conjugated bilirubin

==Treatment==
Treatment is dependent upon the underlying etiology.  Treatment is supportive as it is not possible to induce regrowth of lost ducts.

===Medical therapies===
*[[Ursodeoxycholic acid]]
*[[Immunosuppression]]
**General consensus is that more studies are needed before this can be considered
*[[Organ transplant]]
