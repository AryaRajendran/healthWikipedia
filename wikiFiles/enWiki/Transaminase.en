In [[biochemistry]], a '''transaminase''' or an '''aminotransferase''' is an [[enzyme]] that [[catalyze]]s a type of reaction between an [[amino acid]] and an [[alpha-keto acid|&alpha;-keto acid]]. 

An amino acid contains an [[amine]] (NH<sub>2</sub>) group. A keto acid contains a [[ketone|keto]] (=O) group. In [[transamination]], the NH<sub>2</sub> group on one molecule is exchanged with the =O group on the other molecule. The amino acid becomes a keto acid, and the keto acid becomes an amino acid. 

Some transamination activities of the [[ribosome]] have been found to be catalyzed by so-called [[ribozymes]] (RNA enzymes). Examples being the [[hammerhead ribozyme]], the [[VS ribozyme]] and the [[hairpin ribozyme]]. 

The transaminase enzymes are important in the production of various amino acids, and measuring the [[concentration]]s of various transaminases in the blood is important in the diagnosing and tracking many [[disease]]s. Transaminases require the coenzyme [[pyridoxal-phosphate]], which is converted into [[pyridoxamine]] in the first phase of the reaction, when an amino acid is converted into a keto acid. Enzyme-bound [[pyridoxamine]] in turn reacts with [[pyruvate]], [[oxaloacetate]], or [[alpha-ketoglutarate]], giving [[alanine]], [[aspartic acid]], or [[glutamic acid]], respectively. Many transamination reactions occur in tissues, catalysed by transaminases specific for a particular amino/keto acid pair. The reactions are readily reversible, the direction being determined by which of the reactants are in excess. The specific enzymes are named from one of the reactant pairs, for example; the reaction between glutamic acid and pyruvic acid to make alpha ketoglutaric acid and alanine is called glutamic-pyruvic transaminase or GPT for short.  Tissue transaminase activities can be investigated by incubating a homogenate with various amino/keto aci dpairs. Transamination is demonstrated if the corresponding new amino acid and keto acid are formed, as revealed by paper chromatography. Reversibility is demonstrated by using the complementary keto/amino acid pari as starting reactants. After chromatogram has been taken out of the solvent the chromatogram is then treated with ninhydrin to locate the spots.

Two important transaminase enzymes are AST ([[SGOT]]) and ALT ([[SGPT]]), the presence of [[elevated transaminases]] can be an indicator of liver damage.

==Transaminases in amino acid metabolism in animals==
Animals must metabolize [[proteins]] to amino acids, at the expense of muscle tissue, when [[blood sugar]] is low. The preference of [[liver]] transaminases for [[oxaloacetate]] or [[alpha-ketoglutarate]] plays a key role in funneling nitrogen from [[amino acid]] metabolism to aspartate and glutamate for conversion to urea for excretion of nitrogen. In similar manner, in muscles the use of pyruvate for transamination gives alanine, which is carried by the bloodstream to the liver (the overall reaction being termed ''[[Alanine cycle|glucose-alanine cycle]]''). Here other transaminases regenerate pyruvate, which provides a valuable precursor for [[gluconeogenesis]]. This alanine cycle is analogous to the [[Cori cycle]], which allows [[anaerobic metabolism]] by muscles.
