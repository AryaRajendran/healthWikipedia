'''Tic disorders''' are defined in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) based on type (motor or phonic) and duration of [[tic]]s (sudden, rapid, nonrhythmic, stereotyped).<ref name=BehaveNet>[[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000). [http://behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/touretteTR.htm DSM-IV-TR: Tourette's Disorder.] ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', 4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]), ISBN 0-89042-025-4. Available at BehaveNet.com Retrieved on August 10, 2009.</ref>   Tic disorders are defined similarly by the [[World Health Organization]] (ICD-10 codes).<ref name=Swain>Swain JE, Scahill L, Lombroso PJ, King RA, Leckman JF.

==Classification==
{{Clips of tics}}
Tic disorders are classified  as follows:<ref>Evidente VG.  [http://web.archive.org/web/20080731231002/http://www.postgradmed.com/issues/2000/10_00/evidente_tic.shtml "Is it a tic or Tourette's? Clues for differentiating simple from more complex tic disorders".]  ''Postgraduate medicine''108 (5): 175-6, 179-82. PMID 11043089  Retrieved on 2007-05-24</ref>

* '''Transient tic disorder''' consists of multiple motor and/or phonic tics with duration of at least 4 weeks, but less than 12 months.
* '''Chronic tic disorder''' is either single or multiple motor or phonic tics, but not both, which are present for more than a year.
* '''[[Tourette syndrome]]''' is diagnosed when both motor and phonic tics are present for more than a year.
* '''Tic Disorder NOS''' is diagnosed when tics are present, but do not meet the criteria for any specific tic disorder.

Tic disorders onset in childhood (before the age of 18), and are not due to the effects of medication or another medical condition.

* F95.0   Transient tic disorder
* F95.1   Chronic motor or vocal tic disorder
* F95.2   Combined vocal and multiple motor tic disorder [de la Tourette]
* F95.8   Other tic disorders
* F95.9   Tic disorder, unspecified

==Prevalence==
A large, community-based study suggested that over 19% of school-age children have tic disorders;<ref>Kurlan R, McDermott MP, Deeley C, ''et al.'' "Prevalence of tics in schoolchildren and association with placement in special education". ''Neurology'' 57 (8): 1383-8. PMID 11673576</ref>  the children with tic disorders in that study were usually undiagnosed.

As many as 1 in 100 people may experience some form of tic disorder, usually before the onset of puberty.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050323092424/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/tourette/detail_tourette.htm Tourette Syndrome Fact Sheet.] National Institutes of Health (NIH). Retrieved on 2005-03-23.</ref>  Tourette syndrome is the more severe expression of a spectrum of tic disorders, which are thought to be due to the same genetic vulnerability.  Nevertheless, most cases of Tourette syndrome are not severe. Although a significant amount of investigative work indicates genetic linkage of the various tic disorders, further study is needed to confirm the relationship.<ref>Swerdlow NR. "Tourette syndrome: current controversies and the battlefield landscape". ''Current neurology and neuroscience reports''. 5 (5): 329-31. {{DOI|10.1007/s11910-005-0054-8}} PMID 16131414</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment of tic disorders, although not usually necessary, is similar to [[treatment of Tourette syndrome]].  Tics should be distinguished from other causes of [[tourettism]].
