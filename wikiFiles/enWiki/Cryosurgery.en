'''Cryosurgery''' (cryotherapy) is the application of extreme cold to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue.<ref>[http://dermnetnz.org/procedures/cryotherapy.html DermNet NZ - Cryotherapy]</ref> The term comes from the Greek words '''cryo''' (κρύο) ("icy cold") and '''surgery''' (''cheirourgiki'' - χειρουργική) meaning "hand work" or "handiwork".

Cryosurgery has been historically used to treat a number of diseases and disorders, especially [[List of skin diseases|a variety of benign and malignant skin conditions]].<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic553.htm eMedicine.com - Dermatology - Cryotherapy]</ref>

== Uses ==

[[Wart]]s, [[mole (skin marking)|moles]], [[skin tag]]s, [[solar keratosis|solar keratoses]], [[Morton's neuroma]] and small [[skin cancer]]s are candidates for cryosurgical treatment. Several [[internal medicine|internal disorders]] are also treated with cryosurgery, including [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], lung cancer, oral cancers, [[Cervix|cervical]] disorders and, more commonly in the past, [[hemorrhoids]]. Soft tissue conditions such as [[plantar fasciitis]] and [[fibroma]] can be treated with cryosurgery. 
Generally, all tumors that can be reached by the cryoprobes used during an operation are treatable. Although found to be effective, this method of treatment is only appropriate for use against localized disease, and solid tumors larger than 1&nbsp;cm. Tiny, diffuse [[metastases]] that often coincide with cancers are usually not affected by cryotherapy.

Cryosurgery works by taking advantage of the destructive force of freezing temperatures on [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. At low temperatures, [[ice crystal]]s form inside the cells, which can tear them apart. More damage occurs when [[blood vessel]]s supplying the diseased tissue freeze.

== Method ==
=== Liquid nitrogen===
[[Image:Cryogun.jpg|right|thumb|Cryogun used to spray liquid nitrogen]]
A common method of freezing lesions is using [[liquid nitrogen]] as the cooling solution. The super-cooled liquid may be sprayed on the diseased tissue, circulated through a tube called a cryoprobe, or simply dabbed on with a cotton or foam swab. 

=== Carbon dioxide ===
Less frequently, doctors use [[carbon dioxide]] "snow" formed into a cylinder or mixed with [[acetone]] to form a slush that is applied directly to the treated tissue. 

=== Argon===
Recent advances in technology have allowed for the use of [[argon]] gas to drive ice formation using a principle known as the [[Joule-Thomson effect]]. This gives physicians excellent control of the ice, and minimizing complications using ultra-thin 17 [[Stubs Iron Wire Gauge|gauge]] cryoneedles.  

=== Dimethyl ether - propane ===
A mixture of [[dimethyl ether]] and [[propane]] is used in some preparations such as [[Dr. Scholl's]] Freeze Away.  The mixture is stored in an [[aerosol spray]] type container at room temperature and drops to {{convert|-41|C|F}} when dispensed.  The mixture is often dispensed into a straw with a cotton-tipped swab.

== Results ==
Cryosurgery is a [[minimally invasive]] procedure, and is often preferred to more traditional kinds of surgery because of its minimal pain, scarring, and cost; however, as with any medical treatment, there are risks involved, primarily that of damage to nearby healthy tissue. Damage to [[Nerve|nerve tissue]] is of particular concern.

Patients undergoing cryosurgery usually experience minor-to-moderate localized pain and redness, which can be alleviated by oral administration of [[analgesics]] such as [[aspirin]], [[ibuprofen]] or [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol).  [[Blister]]s may form, but these usually scab over and peel away within several days.
