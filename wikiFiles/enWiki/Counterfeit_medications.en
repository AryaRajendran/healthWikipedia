A '''counterfeit medication''' or a [[counterfeit]] drug is a [[medication]] or pharmaceutical product which is produced and sold with the intent to deceptively represent its origin, authenticity or effectiveness. A counterfeit drug may contain inappropriate quantities of active ingredients, or none, may be improperly processed within the body (e.g., absorption by the body), may contain ingredients that are not on the label (which may or may not be harmful), or may be supplied with inaccurate or fake [[packaging and labeling]]. Medicines which are deliberately mislabeled to deceive consumers&mdash;including mislabeled but otherwise genuine generic drugs&mdash;are counterfeit. Counterfeit drugs are related to [[pharma fraud]]. Drug manufacturers and distributors are increasingly investing in countermeasures, such as traceability and authentication technologies, to try to minimise the impact of counterfeit drugs.<ref>Mark Davison, [http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470616172.html "Pharmaceutical Anti-Counterfeiting: Combating the Real Danger from Fake Drugs"], Wiley, 2011, 426pp</ref>

<!--Counterfeit pharmaceuticals present a real threat to legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturers and can be potentially damaging to a  company’s reputation and financial position. This book describes the different analytical techniques that can be used to distinguish between
genuine and counterfeit pharmaceutical products. A variety of techniques in spectroscopy and chromatography are covered and case studies are included in the publication [http://www.labmate-online.com/book/perry_g._wang_and_albert_i._wertheimer/counterfeit_medicines_volume_ii_detection_identification_and_analysis/11/ Counterfeit Medicines Volume II].

Legitimate, correctly labeled, low-cost [[generic drug]]s are not counterfeit or fake (although they can be counterfeited), but can be caught up in anticounterfeiting enforcement measures.<ref name="K.Mara">Kaitlin Mara, [http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/2010/08/02/coverage-of-anti-counterfeit-policy-debate-varies-widely-across-global-media/ Coverage Of Anti-Counterfeit Policy Debate Varies Widely Across Global Media], [[Intellectual Property Watch]], August 2, 2010.

Counterfeit medicinal drugs include those with less or none of the stated active ingredients, with added, sometimes hazardous, adulterants, substituted ingredients, completely misrepresented, or sold with a false brand name.  Otherwise, legitimate drugs that have passed their date of expiry are sometimes remarked with false dates.  Low-quality counterfeit medication may cause any of several dangerous [[health]] consequences, including [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] or [[allergy|allergic reactions]], in addition to their obvious lack of efficacy due to having less or none of their active ingredients.

Since [[counterfeiting]] is difficult to detect, investigate, quantify, or stop, the quantity of counterfeit medication is difficult to determine. In 2003, the [[World Health Organization]] cited estimates that the annual earnings from substandard and/or counterfeit drugs were over [[USD|US$]]32 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs275/en/ |title=WHO &#124; Substandard and counterfeit medicines |publisher=Who.int |date=August 25, 2004 |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref>  

The considerable difference between the cost of manufacturing counterfeit medication and price counterfeiters charge is a lucrative incentive. Fake [[antibiotic]]s with a low concentration of the active ingredients can do damage world wide by stimulating the development of drug [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] in surviving bacteria. Courses of antibiotic treatment which are not completed can be dangerous or even life threatening. If a low-potency counterfeit drug is involved, completion of a course of treatment cannot be fully effective. Counterfeit drugs have even been known to have been involved in clinical drug trials.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Several technologies may prove helpful in combating the counterfeit drug problem. An example is [[RFID|radio frequency identification]], which uses electronic devices to track and identify items, such as pharmaceutical products, by assigning individual [[serial number]]s to the containers holding each product. The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is working towards an [[electronic pedigree]] (ePedigree) system to track drugs from factory to pharmacy. This technology may prevent the diversion or counterfeiting of drugs by allowing wholesalers and pharmacists to determine the identity and dosage of individual products.  Some techniques, such as [[Raman spectroscopy]] and energy-dispersive X-Ray diffraction (EDXRD)<ref>Williams, J: "Healthcare Distributor", page 81. E.L.F. Publications, Inc., December 2006/January 2007</ref> can be used to discover counterfeit drugs while still inside their packaging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6314287.stm |title=Health &#124; Fake drugs caught inside the pack |publisher=BBC News |date=January 31, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref>

===China===
{{See|Pharmaceutical industry in China}}
The [[State Food and Drug Administration]] is not responsible for regulating pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured and exported by chemical companies. This regulatory lack, which has resulted in considerable international news coverage unfavorable to China, has been known for a decade, but failure of Chinese regulatory agencies to cooperate has prevented improvement.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/world/asia/31chemical.html "Chinese Chemicals Flow Unchecked to World Drug Market"] article reported by Walt Bogdanich, Jake Hooker and Andrew W. Lehren and written by Mr. Bogdanich in the [[New York Times]] October 31, 2007</ref> On May 6, 2005, the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] press agency [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] reported that the [[World Health Organization]] had established [[Rapid Alert System]], the world's first [[World Wide Web|web]]-based system for tracking the activities of drug counterfeiters, in light of the increasing severity of the problem of counterfeit drugs.

=== India ===
According to a report released by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), 75% of fake drugs supplied world over have some origins in India, followed by 7% from Egypt and 6% from China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/news/ng.asp?n=81178-oecd-counterfeit-drug-supply-chain |title=New counterfeit report highlights worrying trends |publisher=Outsourcing-pharma.com |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref>

=== United States ===
The United States has a growing problem with counterfeit drugs. In 2012, tainted [[steroids]] killed 11 people near Boston and sickened another 100.<ref name=Economist>[http://www.economist.com/node/21564546 "Bad Medicine"], ''The Economist'', Oct. 13, 2012</ref>  In another case, vials of the cancer medicine [[Avastin]] were found to contain no active ingredients. The vials were sourced in Turkey, shipped to Switzerland, then Denmark, finally to the United Kingdom from which they were exported to U.S. wholesale distributors.<ref> [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303879604577410430607090226.html#project%3DDRUGS0720%26articleTabs%3Dinteractive]. "How Fake Cancer Drugs Entered U.S.," ''Wall Street Journal'', July 20th, 2012, Christopher Weaver.</ref> The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. wholesale distributor was hired by Canada Drugs, which also owns CanadaDrugs.com, a retail pharmacy website that sells prescription medication internationally, with a focus on the American market. <ref> Ibid</ref> In 2007-08, 149 Americans died from a contaminated blood thinner called [[Heparin]] that was legally imported into the United States. <ref name=Economist/>Investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, the Albers Medical investigation is the most prolific example to date. On August 21, 2005, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri issued a press release announcing that three businesses and eleven individuals were indicted for their involvement in a $42 million dollar conspiracy to sell counterfeit, smuggled and misbranded Lipitor and other drugs and for participating in a conspiracy to sell stolen drugs. As part of this investigation, FDA initiated a recall of more than 18 million Lipitor tablets, which ranks as the largest recall in the history of criminal investigations of counterfeit medications. Participants in this scheme conspired to purchase and sell counterfeit, misbranded and illegally imported drugs. Foreign versions of Lipitor and Celebrex were smuggled into the U.S. from South America and re-sold after being re-packaged to conceal the true origin of the drugs. Counterfeit Lipitor also was manufactured in South America and then smuggled into the U.S. where it was co-mingled with the genuine foreign Lipitor and sold in the U.S. In addition, participants conspired to buy, sell and traffic almost eight million dollars worth of stolen Glaxo Smith Kline and Roche drugs, using fake pedigrees to launder the drugs and thereby concealing that they were stolen. There also were charges related to the sale of counterfeit Procrit, as well as counterfeit and misbranded Serostim and Neupogen. Procrit is an injectable drug used in the treatment of anemia and Neupogen is an injectable drug used by cancer patients to stimulate the production of white blood cells in order to decrease the incidence of infections.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ola/2005/counterfeit1101.html "Hearing on Counterfeit Drugs within the United States"]</ref><ref name=Florida Man Sentenced for $42 Million Lipitor Fraud ref>[http://www.justice.gov/usao/mow/news2007/carlow.sen.htm]</ref>

== Anticounterfeit platforms ==
In 2007, the world's first free-to-access [[anti-counterfeit platform|anticounterfeit platform]]<ref name="mP">{{cite web|title=Home page|url=http://www.mpedigree.net/mpedigree/index.php|publisher=mPedigree|accessdate=January 18, 2012}}</ref> was established in the West African country of Ghana. The platform, dubbed [[Mpedigree|mPedigree]],<ref>Sample news report here: http://news.myjoyonline.com/health/200803/14868.asp</ref> relies on existing GSM networks in that country to provide pharmaceutical consumers and patients with the means to verify whether their purchased medicines are from the original source through a free two-way SMS message, provided the manufacturer of the relevant medication has subscribed to a special scheme. Still in trial stages, the implementers of the platform announced in 2009 that they are in partnership with Ghana's Ministry of Health and the country's specialized agency responsible for drug safety, the Food and Drugs Board, to move the platform from pilot to full-deployment stage.<ref name="mP"/><ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200806200817.html allAfrica.com: Ghana: Country to Use SMS to Fight Fake Drugs (Page 1 of 1)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2010, [[NAFDAC]] in Nigeria launched an [[SMS]]-based anticounterfeiting platform using technology from [[Sproxil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.233.com.gh/posts/2011/unwired/sproxil-fight-against-counterfeit-drugs-continues/ |title="Sproxil fight against counterfeit drugs" |publisher=Tech.233.com.gh |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name=allAfrica>{{cite web|title=Nigeria: NAFDAC Introduces New Anti Counterfeiting Technologies|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201006141446.html|publisher=[[allAfrica]]|accessdate=January 18, 2012|author=Chioma Obinna|coauthors=Gabriel Olawale|month=June 12|year=2010}}</ref> That system was also adopted by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ifedigbo|first=Sylva|title=How to identify fake Ampiclox|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.ng/article/how-identify-fake-ampiclox|work=Daily Times Nigeria|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}</ref>  In April 2011, CNN published a video highlighting Sproxil's solution in the fight against counterfeit drugs in Nigeria.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/international/2011/04/04/mpa.purefoy.drugs.battle.cnn | work=CNN | title=CNN.com Video}}</ref> In July 2011, Kenya's [[Pharmacy and Poisons Board]] also adopted text message-based anticounterfeiting systems and endorsed the Sproxil solution.<ref>{{cite web|author=Phil Taylor |url=http://www.securingpharma.com/40/articles/1000.php |title="Kenya plans national roll-out of mobile anti-counterfeiting tech" |publisher=Securingpharma.com |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> In early 2012 it was announced that more than one million people in Africa had checked their medicines using the text-message based verification service developed by Sproxil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sproxil claims milestone with 1 millionth medicine verification|url=http://www.securingpharma.com/sproxil-claims-milestone-with-1-millionth-medicine-verification-/s40/a1178/|work=SecuringPharma|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}</ref>

An [[ePedigree]] is another important system for the automatic detection of counterfeit drugs.  States such as California are increasingly requiring pharmaceutical companies to generate and store [http://www.pharmacy.ca.gov/about/e_pedigree.shtml ePedigrees for each product they handle].  On January 5, 2007 [[EPCglobal]] ratified the [http://www.epcglobalinc.org/standards/pedigree Pedigree Standard] as an international standard that specifies an [[XML]] description of the life history of a product across an arbitrarily complex supply chain.

==Illegal drugs of abuse==
Illegal drugs can be counterfeited easily because no standards or regulations govern them or their packaging though some examples of illegal drugs are sold under "brand names" to indicate certain standards or dosage levels were being adhered to, as in the case of 1960s-era [[LSD]], which was sold with patterns or logos printed on blotter paper. These illegal "brands" can also be counterfeited by drug dealers who want to be able to sell their products at higher prices. 

Counterfeit illegal and recreational drugs range from products which do not contain any [[active ingredient]]s, as in cases where lactose powder is sold as heroin, or dried herbs such as oregano are sold as cannabis, to cases where the active ingredients are "cut" with a diluent (as in cases where cocaine is mixed with lactose powder), and cases where the claimed active ingredients are substituted by something cheaper (e.g., when [[methamphetamine]] is sold as [[cocaine]]).

The use of diluents in illegal drugs reduces the potency of the drugs and makes it hard for users to determine the appropriate dosage level. Diluents include "foodstuffs (flour and baby milk formula), sugars (glucose, lactose, maltose, and mannitol), and inorganic materials such as powder."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=182672 |title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service |publisher=Ncjrs.gov |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> The diluents used often depend on the way drug purchasers consume particular drugs. Drug dealers selling heroin to users who inject dilute the drug with different products from dealers selling to users who smoke or [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflate]] the drug; diluents which can easily form a solution with water for injecting heroin can be problematic for users who are sniffing the powder. When cocaine is mixed with diluents for the purpose of injection, the "...diluents can produce serious abscesses and pain if the user misses the vein and injects into muscle tissue."<ref>Office of National Drug Control Policy - Publications - Pulse Check: Trends in Drug Abuse, Summer 1997</ref> "Diluents and adulterants are often added to No. 3 heroin", including sugar, quinine, barbital and caffeine, some of which "can cause serious side effects."<ref>{{cite web|author=changnoi.com |url=http://hangoverguide.com/factbook/opi_burma.html |title=Opium and Heroin production in Burma-Part1 &#124;GlobalHangoverGuide |publisher=Hangoverguide.com |date=November 9, 1973 |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> Dr. Hirsch, the New York Medical Examiner, claimed that buying illegal drugs is "... like playing [[Russian roulette]]," because "there is no way of knowing just what a heroin dealer has slipped into the packets." In some cases, if a dealer does not take the time to dilute the drug with lactose or other fillers, a "very potent blend of heroin" is sold, which can lead to overdoses.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E3D81238F937A3575AC0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=Potent New Blend of Heroin Ends 8 Very Different Lives | first=Joseph B. | last=Tr | date=September 4, 1994 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref>

Claims that illegal drugs are routinely cut with substances such as rat poison and crushed glass, often cited in antidrug pamphlets, are largely unsubstantiated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ecstasy - common misconceptions|url=http://www.drugscope.org.uk/resources/mediaguide/ecstasymyths.htm|publisher=[[DrugScope]]|accessdate=January 18, 2012}}</ref>
