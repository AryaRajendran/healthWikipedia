'''Ewing's sarcoma''' is a malignant [[small, round, blue cell tumour]]. It is a rare disease in which [[cancer]] cells are found in the [[bone]] or in soft [[biological tissue|tissue]]. The most common areas in which it occurs are the [[pelvis]], the [[femur]], the [[humerus]], the [[ribs]] and clavicle (collar bone). 

Because a common genetic locus is responsible for a large percentage of Ewing's sarcoma and [[primitive neuroectodermal tumor]]s, these are sometimes grouped together in a category known as the [[Ewing family of tumors]].<ref name="pmid17272319">{{cite journal |author=Iwamoto Y |title=Diagnosis and treatment of Ewing's sarcoma |journal=Jpn. J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=79–89 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17272319 |doi=10.1093/jjco/hyl142 |url=http://jjco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17272319}}</ref>  The diseases are, however, considered to be different:  peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumours are generally not associated with bones, while Ewing sarcomas are most commonly related to bone.

Ewing's sarcoma occurs most frequently in [[teenagers]] and [[Young adult (psychology)|young adults]], with a male/female ratio of 1.6:1.<ref name="pmid8419714">{{cite journal |author=Burt M |title=Medical tumours of the chest wall.

Although usually classified as a bone tumour, Ewing's sarcoma can have characteristics of both [[mesoderm]]al and [[ectoderm]]al origin, making it difficult to classify.<ref name="pmid14600088">{{cite journal |author=Longtin R |title=Ewing sarcoma: a miracle drug waiting to happen? |journal=J.

[[James Ewing (pathologist)|James Ewing]] (1866–1943) first described the tumour, establishing that the disease was separate from [[lymphoma]] and other types of cancer known at that time.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2367}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ewing, J. |title=Diffuse endothelioma of bone |journal=Proceedings of the New York Pathological Society |volume=21 |pages=17–24 |year=1921 }}</ref>

==Causes==
Genetic exchange between chromosomes can cause cells to become cancerous. Most cases of Ewing's sarcoma (85%) are the result of a [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] between chromosomes 11 and 22, which fuses the [[EWS gene]] of [[chromosome 22]] to the [[FLI1]] gene of [[chromosome 11]].<ref name=Cecil />

EWS/FLI functions as the master regulator.<ref name="pmid18414662">{{cite journal |author=Owen LA, Kowalewski AA, Lessnick SL |title=EWS/FLI mediates transcriptional repression via NKX2.2 during oncogenic transformation in Ewing's sarcoma |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=e1965 |year=2008 |pmid=18414662 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001965 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001965 |pmc=2291578 |editor1-last=Wu |editor1-first=Xiaolin}}</ref>

Other translocations are at t(21;22)<ref name="pmid8162068">{{cite journal |author=Sorensen PH, Lessnick SL, Lopez-Terrada D, Liu XF, Triche TJ, Denny CT |title=A second Ewing's sarcoma translocation, t(21;22), fuses the EWS gene to another ETS-family transcription factor, ERG |journal=Nat.

Signs  symptoms include: intermittent [[Fever|fevers]], [[anemia]], [[leukocytosis]], increased [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|sedimentation rate]], and other symptoms of inflammatory systemic illness.<ref name=Cecil />

According to [[The Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT)]], the most common symptoms are: localized pain, swelling, and sporadic bone pain with variable intensity.  The swelling is most likely to be visible if the sarcoma is located on a bone near the surface of the body, but when it occurs in other places deeper in the body, like on the pelvis, it may not be visible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcrt.org.uk/bci_symptoms_of_ewings_sarcoma.php |title=Symptoms of Ewing's Sarcoma - Bone Cancer Research Trust |publisher=Bcrt.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-05}}</ref>

==Clinical findings==
[[image:636039cfb96dc46674512d89a8229c big gallery.jpg|thumb|Distribution of Ewing's sarcoma. Most frequent locations are the large long bones and the [[pelvis]].]]
Ewing's sarcoma is more common in males and usually presents in childhood or early adulthood, with a peak between 10 and 20 years of age. It can occur anywhere in the body, but most commonly in the [[pelvis]] and proximal long tubular bones, especially around the growth plates. The [[diaphyses]] of the [[femur]] are the most common sites, followed by the [[tibia]] and the [[humerus]]. Thirty percent are overtly [[metastasis|metastatic]] at presentation. Patients usually experience extreme bone pain.

Ewing's sarcoma cells are positive for [[CD99]] and [[MIC2]],<ref name=Cecil /> and negative for [[CD45]].<ref name="pmid16720851">{{cite journal |author=Bernstein M |title=Ewing sarcoma family of tumours: current management |journal=Oncologist |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=503–19 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16720851 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.11-5-503 |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16720851 |author-separator=, |author2=Kovar H |author3=Paulussen M |display-authors=3 |last4=Randall |first4=RL |last5=Schuck |first5=A |last6=Teot |first6=LA |last7=Juergens |first7=H}}</ref>

==Imaging findings==
[[Image:Ewing sarcoma tibia child.jpg|thumb|right|100px|X-Ray of a child with Ewing sarcoma of the [[tibia]].]] 
[[Image:Ewing's sarcoma MRI nci-vol-1832-300.jpg|thumb|[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] slice showing Ewing's sarcoma of the left hip (white area shown right).]]
On conventional [[radiography|radiographs]], the most common osseous presentation is a permeative lytic lesion with [[periosteum|periosteal]] reaction. The classic description of lamellated or "onion skin" type [[periosteum|periosteal]] reaction is often associated with this lesion.  Plain films add valuable information in the initial evaluation or screening. The wide zone of transition (e.g. permeative) is the most useful plain film characteristic in differentiation of benign versus aggressive or malignant lytic lesions.

[[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] should be routinely used in the work-up of malignant tumours. MRI will show the full bony and soft tissue extent and relate the tumour to other nearby anatomic structures (e.g. vessels). [[Gadolinium]] contrast is not necessary as it does not give additional information over noncontrast studies, though some current researchers argue that dynamic, contrast enhanced MRI may help determine the amount of necrosis within the tumour, thus help in determining response to treatment prior to surgery.

[[Computed axial tomography|CT]] can also be used to define the extraosseous extent of the tumour, especially in the skull, spine, ribs and pelvis. Both CT and MRI can be used to follow response to radiation and/or [[chemotherapy]].

Bone [[scintigraphy]] can also be used to follow tumour response to therapy.

In the group of malignant small round cell tumours which include Ewing's sarcoma, bone lymphoma and small cell osteosarcoma, the cortex may appear almost normal radiographically, while there is permeative growth throughout the Haversian channels.
These tumours may be accompanied by a large soft tissue mass while there is almost no visible bone destruction.
The radiographs frequently do not shown any signs of cortical destruction.

Radiographically Ewing's Sarcoma presents as "Moth-eaten" destructive radiolucencies of the medulla and erosion of the cortex with expansion.


A grouping of three unrelated teenagers in Wake Forest NC have diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma. All three children were diagnosed in 2011 and all attended the same temporary classroom together while the school underwent renovation. A fourth teenager living nearby was diagnosed in 2009. The odds of this grouping are considered significant.  <ref>http://www.wral.com/three-wake-students-battle-rare-cancer-cluster-or-coincidence-/12389860/</ref>

==Clinical differential diagnosis==
{{expand section|date=February 2013}}
Other entities that may have a similar clinical presentation include [[osteomyelitis]], [[osteosarcoma]] (especially telangiectatic osteosarcoma) and [[eosinophilic granuloma]]. Soft tissue neoplasms such as [[pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma]] (malignant fibrous histiocytoma) that erode into adjacent bone may also have a similar appearance.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Ewing sarcoma - intermed mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a metastatic Ewing's sarcoma with the characteristic cytoplasmic clearing on H&E staining, which was showing to be PAS positive.]]
The definitive diagnosis is based on [[histomorphologic]] findings, [[immunohistochemistry]] and [[molecular pathology]].

Ewing's sarcoma is a [[small round cell tumor]], that typically has a clear cytoplasm on [[H&E stain]]ing, due to [[glycogen]].  The presence of the glycogen can be demonstrated with positive [[PAS stain]]ing and negative [[PAS diastase]] staining.  The characteristic [[immunostain]] is [[CD99]] which diffusely marks the [[cell membrane]]. Morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are corroborated with an associated [[chromosomal translocation]], of which there are several.  The most common translocation, present in approximately 90% of Ewing sarcoma cases, is t(11;22)(q24;q12).<ref>{{cite web|title=Soft tissue tumors: Ewing's tumors/Primitive neurectodermal tumors (PNET)|url=http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/Tumors/Ewing5010.html|publisher=Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology|accessdate=5 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=pmid3163261>{{cite journal |author=Turc-Carel C |title=Chromosomes in Ewing's sarcoma.

The pathologic differential diagnosis is the grouping of [[Small, round, blue cell tumour]]s, which includes [[lymphoma]], alveolar [[rhabdomyosarcoma]] and [[desmoplastic small round cell tumor]], among others.

==Epidemiology==
Ewing's sarcomas represent 16% of primary bone sarcomas.<ref name=Cecil>{{cite book|last=medicine|first=s cecil|title=Goldman|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4377-2788-3|page=1326|edition=24th ed.}}</ref>  

Ewing's sarcoma in the United States is most common in the second decade of life,<ref name=Cecil /> with a rate of 0.3 cases per million in children under 3 years of age, and as high as 4.6 cases per million in adolescents aged 15–19 years. Internationally the annual incidence rate averages less than 2 cases per million children.<ref>{{EMedicine|radio|275|Ewing Sarcoma Imaging}}</ref> In the United Kingdom an average of six children per year are diagnosed, mainly males in early stages of puberty.  Due to the prevalence of diagnosis during teenage years, there may possibly be a link between the onset of puberty and the early stages of this disease, although no research is currently being conducted to confirm this hypothesis.

==Treatment==
Almost all patients require multidrug [[chemotherapy]] (often including [[ifosfamide]] and [[etoposide]])<ref name="pmid18258578">{{cite journal |author=Lahl M, Fisher VL, Laschinger K |title=Ewing sarcoma family of tumours: an overview from diagnosis to survivorship |journal=Clin J Oncol Nurs |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=89–97 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18258578 |doi=10.1188/08.CJON.89-97 |url=http://ons.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&doi=10.1188/08.CJON.89-97}}</ref> as well as local disease control with surgery and/or radiation.<ref name=Randall>{{cite web|author=Randall, RL|year=2005|title=Ewing's Sarcoma Family of Tumours (ESFT)|work=ESUN|url=http://sarcomahelp.org/learning_center/ewings_sarcoma.html| accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> An aggressive approach is necessary because almost all patients with apparently localized disease at the time of diagnosis actually have asymptomatic metastatic disease. 

Treatment often consists of neo-adjuvant [[chemotherapy]], which may include [[vincristine]], [[doxorubicin]], and [[cyclophosphamide]] with [[ifosfamide]] and [[etoposide]].<ref name=Cecil /> After about three months of chemotherapy, the remaining tumor is surgically resected, radiated, or both.<ref name=Cecil /> The surgical resection may involve limb salvage or [[amputation]]. Complete excision at the time of biopsy may be performed if malignancy is confirmed at the time it is examined.  

Treatment lengths vary depending on location and stage of the disease at diagnosis. Radical chemotherapy may be as short as 6 treatments at 3 week cycles, however most patients will undergo chemotherapy for 6–12 months and radiation therapy for 5–8 weeks.{{cn|date=January 2013}}
Radiotherapy has been used for localised disease. The tumor has a unique property of being highly sensitive to radiation, sometimes acknowledged by the phrase "melting like snow". But the main drawback is that it recurs dramatically after sometime.{{cn|date=January 2013}} [[Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide]]s have been proposed as possible treatment by down-regulating the expression of the oncogenic fusion protein associated with the development of Ewing's sarcoma resulting from the EWS-ETS gene translocation.<ref name="pmid18310898">{{cite journal |author=Asami S |title=Treatment of Ewing sarcoma using an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to regulate the cell cycle |journal=Biol.

===Fertility preservation===
In women, chemotherapy may damage the [[ovaries]] and cause [[infertility]]. To avail for future pregnancies, the woman may preserve oocytes or ovarian tissue by [[oocyte cryopreservation]] or [[ovarian tissue cryopreservation]] prior to starting chemotherapy.
