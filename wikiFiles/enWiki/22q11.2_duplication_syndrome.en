'''22q11.2 duplication syndrome''' is a rare [[genetic disorder]] caused by a [[Duplication (genetics)|duplication]] of a segment at the end of [[chromosome 22]].

==Clinical features==

The most frequent reported symptoms in patients with duplication of 22q11.2 duplication syndrome are [[mental retardation]]/learning disabilility (97% of patients), [[Psychomotor retardation|delayed psychomotor development]] (67% of patients), growth retardation (63% of patients) and muscular [[hypotonia]] (43% of patients).<ref name="pmid18707033">{{cite journal |author=Wentzel C, Fernström M, Ohrner Y, Annerén G, Thuresson AC |title=Clinical variability of the 22q11.2 duplication syndrome |journal=Eur J Med Genet |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=501–10 |year=2008 |pmid=18707033 |doi=10.1016/j.ejmg.2008.07.005 |url=}}</ref> However, these are common and relatively non-specific indications for [[cytogenetic]] analysis, and the extent to which the duplication of 22q11.2 causes these features is currently unknown.  The duplication is frequently inherited from a normal parent, so it is clear that intellectual development can be normal.

==Size of duplication==

Duplications of 22q11 vary in size and thereby in gene content. They include the typical common 3-Mb microduplication, 1.5-Mb nested duplication, consistent with [[non-allelic homologous recombination]] (NAHR) using distinct low-copy repeats. These microduplications likely represent the predicted reciprocal rearrangements to the microdeletions characterized in the 22q11.2 region.<ref name="pmid18414210">{{cite journal |author=Ou Z, Berg JS, Yonath H, ''et al.'' |title=Microduplications of 22q11.2 are frequently inherited and are associated with variable phenotypes |journal=Genet. Med. |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=267–77 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18414210 |doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31816b64c2 |url=}}</ref> Smaller microduplications may occur within this highly dynamic with frequent rearrangements using alternative low-copy repeats  as recombination substrates within and distal to the [[DiGeorge syndrome]] region.

==Origin of duplication==

The majority of 22q11 duplications are [[Mendelian inheritance|inherited]] often from a parent with a normal or near-normal [[phenotype]]. This is in sharp distinction to [[22q11 deletion syndrome]] where about 90% of cases are caused by mutations that occur ''[[De novo synthesis|de novo]]''.
