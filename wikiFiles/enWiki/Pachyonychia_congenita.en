'''Pachyonychia congenita''' is an [[autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] skin disorder. 

==Symptoms==
Common symptoms include:

*Excess keratin in nail beds and thickening of the nails
*[[Hyperkeratosis]] on hands and feet
*Oral lesions that look like thick white plaques
*Steatocystoma multiplex
*Pain
*Blisters

== Types ==
Pachyonychia congenita may be divided into the following types<ref name="Fitz2">Freedberg, et al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-138076-0.</ref>{{rp|510}}:
*[[Pachyonychia congenita type I]] (Jadassohn–Lewandowsky syndrome)
*[[Pachyonychia congenita type II]] (Jackson–Lawler pachyonychia congenita, Jackson–Sertoli syndrome)

== Pathophysiology ==
The condition is caused by [[genetic mutations]] in one of four [[genes]] that encode [[keratin]] [[protein]]s specific to the [[epithelial]] tissues affected in the two forms of the disorder.  PC1 is caused by mutations in [[keratin 6A]] (protein name K6A; gene name ''KRT6A'') or [[keratin 16]] (protein K16; gene ''KRT16''). The PC2 form is due to mutations in the genes encoding [[keratin 6B]] (protein name K6B; gene name ''KRT6B'') or [[keratin 17]] (protein K17; gene ''KRT17'').  Three of the genes causing PC were identified in 1995<ref>{{cite journal |author=McLean WH |title=Keratin 16 and keratin 17 mutations cause pachyonychia congenita |journal=Nat.

== Inheritance ==

[[File:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|Pachyonychia congenita has an autosomal dominant pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

Pachyonychia congenita follows an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern of inheritance, which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and only one copy of the gene is required to inherit the disorder from a parent who has the disorder. On average, 50% of the offspring of an affected person will inherit the disorder, regardless of gender. 

Occasionally, however, a solitary case can emerge in a family with no prior history of the disorder due to the occurrence of a new [[mutation]] (often referred to as a sporadic or spontaneous mutation).
