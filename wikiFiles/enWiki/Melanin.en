'''Melanin''' {{IPAc-en|audio=melanin-pronunciation.ogg|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|ə|n|ɪ|n}} ({{lang-el|μέλας}} - ''melas'', "black") is a [[ubiquitous]] natural [[pigment]] found in most organisms ([[spider]]s are one of the few groups in which it has not been detected). In animals melanin pigments are derivatives of the amino acid [[tyrosine]]. The most common [[biological tissue|biological]] melanin is '''eumelanin'''.  This is a brown-black [[polymer]] of dihydroxy[[indole]] [[carboxylic acid]]s and their reduced forms.  Another common form of melanin is [[pheomelanin]], a cysteine-containing red-brown [[polymer]] of [[benzothiazine]] units largely responsible for red hair and [[freckle]]s. 

The production of melanin in human skin is called [[melanogenesis]]. Production of melanin is  induced by UVB-radiation simulated by DNA, which is also a photoprotectant.<ref name=Agar2005>{{cite journal |author=Agar N, Young AR |title=Melanogenesis: a photoprotective response to DNA damage? |journal=Mutation research |volume=571 |issue=1–2 |pages=121–32 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15748643 |doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2004.11.016 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 1546980 | doi=10.1002/bies.950140111 | volume=14 | issue=1 | title=The function of melanin or six blind people examine an elephant | year=1992 | month=January | author=Hill HZ | journal=BioEssays | pages=49–56}}</ref>  This occurs by means of a process called "ultrafast [[internal conversion (chemistry)|internal conversion]]".

== Humans ==
[[File:Albinistic girl papua new guinea.jpg|thumb|right|[[Albinism]] occurs when melanocytes produce little or no melanin. This albino girl is from [[Papua New Guinea]].]]

In humans, melanin is the primary determinant of [[human skin color|skin color]].  It is also found in [[hair]], the pigmented tissue underlying the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] of the eye, and the [[stria vascularis of cochlear duct|stria vascularis]] of the [[inner ear]]. In the brain, tissues with melanin include the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] and pigment-bearing neurons within areas of the [[brainstem]], such as the [[locus coeruleus]] and the [[substantia nigra]]. It also occurs in the [[zona reticularis]] of the [[adrenal gland]]. 

The melanin in the skin is produced by [[melanocyte]]s, which are found in the [[Stratum germinativum|basal layer]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. Although, in general, human beings possess a similar concentration of melanocytes in their skin, the melanocytes in some individuals and ethnic groups more frequently or less frequently [[gene expression|express]] the melanin-producing [[gene]]s, thereby conferring a greater or lesser concentration of skin melanin. Some individual animals and humans have very little or no melanin synthesis in their bodies, a condition known as [[albinism]].

Because melanin is an aggregate of smaller component molecules, there are many different types of melanin with differing proportions and bonding patterns of these component molecules. Both pheomelanin and eumelanin are found in human skin and [[hair]], but eumelanin is the most abundant melanin in humans, as well as the form most likely to be deficient in [[albinism]].

=== Eumelanin ===
[[File:Eumelanine.svg|thumb|left|Part of the structural formula of eumelanin. "(COOH)" can be COOH or H, or (more rarely) other [[substituent]]s. The arrow denotes where the polymer continues.]]
Eumelanin [[polymer]]s have long been thought to comprise numerous cross-linked 5,6-dihydroxy[[indole]] ([[5,6-dihydroxyindole|DHI]]) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-[[carboxylic acid]] ([[DHICA]]) polymers.  The two types are recognized: black and brown. Black melanin is darker than brown. Black eumelanin and brown eumelanin are found in non-Europeans.  A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes grey hair. A small amount of brown eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes yellow (blond) color hair.

=== Pheomelanin ===
[[File:Pheomelanine.svg|thumb|right|Part of the structural formula of pheomelanin. "(COOH)" can be COOH or H, or (more rarely) other [[substituent]]s. The arrows denote where the polymer continues.]]
Pheomelanin is found in hair and skin of lighter-skinned humans. Pheomelanin imparts a pink to red hue and, thus, is found in particularly large quantities in [[red hair]].<ref>V.Krishnaraj, M.D, Skin Layers</ref> Pheomelanin is particularly concentrated in the lips, nipples, glans of the penis, and vagina.<ref>http://www.metacyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=COMPOUND&object=CPD-12380</ref> Pheomelanin also may become [[carcinogen]]ic when exposed to the ultraviolet rays of the sun. In chemical terms, pheomelanin differs from eumelanin in that its oligomer structure incorporates [[benzothiazine]] and [[benzothiazole]] units that are produced,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Greco|first=Giorgia|coauthors=Lucia Panzella, Luisella Verotta, Marco d’Ischia, Alessandra Napolitano|title=Uncovering the Structure of Human Red Hair Pheomelanin:Benzothiazolylthiazinodihydroisoquinolines As Key Building Blocks|journal=Journal of Natural Products |year=2011|volume=74|issue=4|doi=10.1021/np100740n|pages=675–82|pmid=21341762}}</ref>  instead of DHI and [[DHICA]], when the amino acid [[L-cysteine]] is present.

== Other organisms ==
Melanins have very diverse roles and functions in various organisms. A form of melanin makes up the ink used by many [[cephalopod]]s (see [[cephalopod ink]]) as a defense mechanism against predators. Melanins also protect microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, against stresses that involve cell damage such as [[UV radiation]] from the sun and [[reactive oxygen species]]. Melanin also protects against damage from high temperatures, chemical stresses (such as [[heavy metals]] and [[oxidizing agents]]), and biochemical threats (such as host defenses against invading microbes).<ref name="Hamilton & Gomez">{{cite journal|author=Hamilton AJ, Gomez BL.|year= 2002|title=Melanins in fungal pathogens|journal=J.

In invertebrates, a major aspect of the innate immune defense system against invading pathogens involves melanin. Within minutes after infection, the microbe is encapsulated within melanin (melanization), and the generation of free radical byproducts during the formation of this capsule is thought to aid in killing them.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cerenius L, Söderhäll K |title=The prophenoloxidase-activating system in invertebrates |journal=Immunological reviews |volume=198 |issue= |pages=116–26 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15199959 |doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.00116.x |url=}}</ref> Some types of fungi, called [[radiotrophic fungus|radiotrophic fungi]], appear to be able to use melanin as a photosynthetic pigment that enables them to capture [[gamma rays]]<ref>[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070526/fob5.asp Science News, Dark Power: Pigment seems to put radiation to good use], Week of May 26, 2007; Vol. 171, No. 21 , p. 325 by Davide Castelvecchi</ref> and harness its energy for growth.<ref name="Dadachova et al.">{{cite journal|author=Dadachova E, Bryan RA, Huang X, Moadel T, Schweitzer AD, Aisen P, Nosanchuk JD, Casadevall A.|year= 2007|title=Ionizing radiation changes the electronic properties of melanin and enhances the growth of melanized fungi|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=2|pages=e457|pmid=17520016 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000457|issue=5|pmc=1866175|editor1-last=Rutherford|editor1-first=Julian}}</ref>

The black feathers of birds owe their color to melanin; they are much more readily degraded by bacteria than  white feathers, or those containing other pigments such as [[carotene]]s.<ref name= grande>{{cite journal| last= Grande | first= Juan Manuel | coauthors= Negro, Juan José;  María Torres, José | year= 2004| title=  The evolution of bird plumage colouration; a role for feather-degrading bacteria? | journal= Ardeola  | volume= 51 | issue = 2 | pages= 375&ndash;383 | url = | doi =  }}</ref>

In some mice, melanin is used slightly differently. For instance, in Agouti mice, the hair appears brown because of alternation between black eumelanin production and a yellow variety of pheomelanin. The hairs are actually banded black and yellow, and the net effect is the brown color of most mice. Some genetic irregularities can produce either fully black or fully yellow mice.

[[Catechol melanin]]s are plant melanins.

== Biosynthetic pathways ==

[[File:L-Tyrosin phys.svg|thumb|L-tyrosine]]
[[File:3,4-Dihydroxy-L-phenylalanin (Levodopa).svg|thumb|L-DOPA]]
[[File:L-Dopachinon.svg|thumb|L-dopaquinone]]
[[File:L-Leucodopachrom.svg|thumb|L-leucodopachrome]]
[[File:L-Dopachrom.svg|thumb|L-dopachrome]]
The first step of the biosynthetic pathway for both eumelanins and pheomelanins is [[Enzyme catalysis|catalysed]] by [[tyrosinase]]:
:[[Tyrosine]] → [[L-DOPA|DOPA]] → [[dopaquinone]]
Dopaquinone can combine with [[cysteine]] by two pathways to benzothiazines and pheomelanins
:Dopaquinone + cysteine → 5-S-cysteinyldopa → benzothiazine intermediate → pheomelanin

:Dopaquinone + cysteine → 2-S-cysteinyldopa → benzothiazine intermediate → pheomelanin

Alternatively, dopaquinone can be converted to [[leucodopachrome]] and follow two more pathways to the eumelanins
:Dopaquinone → leucodopachrome → [[dopachrome]] → 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid → quinone → eumelanin

:Dopaquinone → leucodopachrome → dopachrome → 5,6-dihydroxyindole → [[quinone]] → eumelanin

Detailed metabolic pathways can be found in the [http://www.kegg.jp/ KEGG database] (see [[#External links|External links]]).

===Microscopic appearance===

Melanin is brown, non-refractile, and finely granular with individual granules having a diameter of less than 800 nanometers. This differentiates melanin from common [[hemosiderin|blood breakdown pigments]], which are larger, chunky, and refractile, and range in color from green to yellow or red-brown. In heavily pigmented lesions, dense aggregates of melanin can obscure histologic detail. A dilute solution of [[potassium permanganate]] is an effective melanin bleach.

== Genetic disorders and disease states ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Cat]] -->
Melanin deficiency has been connected for some time with various genetic abnormalities and disease states.

There are approximately nine different types of [[oculocutaneous albinism]], which is mostly an autosomal recessive disorder. Certain ethnicities have higher incidences of different forms. For example, the most common type, called oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2), is especially frequent among people of black [[Africa]]n descent. It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a [[congenital]] reduction or absence of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. The estimated frequency of OCA2 among [[African-American]]s is 1 in 10,000, which contrasts with a frequency of 1 in 36,000 in white Americans.<ref>[http://albinism.med.umn.edu/mmm.htm Oculocutaneous Albinism<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In some African nations, the frequency of the disorder is even higher, ranging from 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000.<ref name=emedicine>[http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic260.htm "Ocular Manifestations of Albinism"]</ref> Another form of Albinism, the "yellow oculocutaneous albinism", appears to be more prevalent among the [[Amish]], who are of primarily [[Switzerland|Swiss]] and [[Germany|German]] ancestry. People with this IB variant of the disorder commonly have white hair and skin at birth, but rapidly develop normal skin pigmentation in infancy.<ref name=emedicine/>

Ocular albinism affects not only eye pigmentation, but visual acuity, as well. People with albinism typically test poorly, within the 20/60 to 20/400 range. In addition, two forms of albinism, with approximately 1 in 2700 most prevalent among people of Puerto Rican origin, are associated with mortality beyond melanoma-related deaths.

{{quote|Mortality also is increased in patients with [[Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome]] and [[Chediak-Higashi syndrome]]. Patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome have a bleeding diathesis secondary to platelet dysfunction and also experience restrictive lung disease (pulmonary fibrosis), inflammatory bowel disease, cardiomyopathy, and renal disease. Patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome are susceptible to infection and also can develop lymphofollicular malignancy.|<ref name=emedicine/>}}

The role that melanin deficiency plays in such disorders remains under study.

The connection between albinism and [[deafness]] is well known, though poorly understood.  In his 1859 treatise ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] observed that "cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally deaf".<ref>[http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin/texts/origin_6th/origin6th_01.html Termination of British Library Net internet service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In humans, hypopigmentation and deafness occur together in the rare [[Waardenburg's syndrome]], predominantly observed among the [[Hopi]] in [[North America]].<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=OMIM&dopt=Detailed&tmpl=dispomimTemplate&list_uids=300700 OMIM Result<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The incidence of albinism in Hopi Indians has been estimated as approximately 1 in 200 individuals. It is interesting to note that similar patterns of albinism and deafness have been found in other mammals, including dogs and rodents. However, a lack of melanin ''per se'' does not appear to be directly responsible for deafness associated with hypopigmentation, as most individuals lacking the enzymes required to synthesize melanin have normal auditory function.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=606933 Omim - Tyrosinase; Tyr<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Instead the absence of [[melanocytes]] in the stria vascularis of the inner ear results in [[cochlea]]r impairment,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cable J, Huszar D, Jaenisch R, Steel KP |title=Effects of mutations at the W locus (c-kit) on inner ear pigmentation and function in the mouse |journal=Pigment Cell Research |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=17–32 |year=1994 |month=February |pmid=7521050 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0749.1994.tb00015.x|url=}}</ref> though why this is, is not fully understood.

In [[Parkinson's disease]], a disorder that affects [[neuromotor]] functioning, there is decreased neuromelanin in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus as consequence of specific dropping out of dopaminergic and noradrenergic pigmented neurons. This results in diminished [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] synthesis. While no correlation between race and the level of neuromelanin in the substantia nigra has been reported, the significantly lower incidence of Parkinson's in blacks than in whites has "prompt[ed] some to suggest that cutaneous melanin might somehow serve to protect the neuromelanin in substantia nigra from external toxins.".<ref>[http://www.seniorpsychiatry.com/pages/articles/lewy.html Lewy Body Disease<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Also see Nicolaus<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=15949901 | doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2005.04.011 | volume=65 | issue=4 | title=A critical review of the function of neuromelanin and an attempt to provide a unified theory | year=2005 | author=Nicolaus BJ | journal=Med.

In addition to melanin deficiency, the molecular weight of the melanin [[polymer]] may be decreased by various factors such as oxidative stress, exposure to light, perturbation in its association with melanosomal [[matrix protein]]s, changes in [[pH]] or in local concentrations of metal ions. A decreased molecular weight or a decrease in the degree of polymerization of '''ocular melanin''' has been proposed to turn the normally anti-oxidant polymer into a [[pro-oxidant]]. In its pro-oxidant state, melanin has been suggested to be involved in the causation and progression of [[macular degeneration]] and [[melanoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meyskens FL, Farmer P, Fruehauf JP |title=Redox regulation in human melanocytes and melanoma |journal=Pigment Cell Research |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=148–54 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11434561 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0749.2001.140303.x |url=}}</ref>  [[Rasagiline]], an important monotherapy drug in Parkinson's disease, has melanin binding properties, and [[melanoma]] tumor reducing properties.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22515841]

Higher eumelanin levels also can be a disadvantage, however, beyond a higher disposition toward vitamin D deficiency. Dark skin is a complicating factor in the laser removal of [[port-wine stain]]s. Effective in treating white skin, in general, lasers are less successful in removing port-wine stains in people of Asian or African descent. Higher concentrations of melanin in darker-skinned individuals simply diffuse and absorb the laser radiation, inhibiting light absorption by the targeted tissue. In similar manner, melanin can complicate laser treatment of other dermatological conditions in people with darker skin.

[[Freckles]] and [[mole (skin marking)|mole]]s are formed where there is a localized concentration of melanin in the skin. They are highly associated with pale skin.

[[Nicotine]] has an affinity for melanin-containing tissues because of its precursor function in melanin synthesis or its irreversible binding of melanin. This has been suggested to underlie the increased [[Nicotine#Dependence|nicotine dependence]] and lower [[smoking cessation]] rates in darker pigmented individuals.<ref>King G, Yerger VB, Whembolua GL, Bendel RB, Kittles R, Moolchan ET. Link between facultative melanin and tobacco use among African Americans.(2009). Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 92(4):589-96. {{doi|10.1016/j.pbb.2009.02.011}} PMID 19268687</ref>

==Human adaptation==
Melanocytes insert granules of melanin into specialized cellular [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] called [[melanosome]]s. These are then transferred into the other skin cells of the human [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. The melanosomes in each recipient cell accumulate atop the [[cell nucleus]], where they protect the nuclear [[DNA]] from mutations caused by the [[ionizing radiation]] of the sun's [[ultraviolet]] rays. In general, people whose ancestors lived for long periods in the regions of the globe near the [[equator]] have larger quantities of eumelanin in their skins. This makes their skins brown or black and protects them against high levels of exposure to the sun, which more frequently results in [[melanoma]]s in lighter-skinned people.

With humans, exposure to sunlight stimulates the [[skin]] to produce [[vitamin D]]. Because high levels of cutaneous melanin act as a natural sun screen, dark skin can be a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency in regions of the Earth known as cool temperate zones, i.e., above 36 degrees latitude in the Northern hemisphere and below 36 degrees in the Southern hemisphere. As a result of this, health authorities in Canada and the USA have issued recommendations for people with darker complexions (including people of southern European descent) to consume between 1000-2000 IU (International Units) of vitamin D, daily, autumn through spring.

The most recent scientific evidence indicates that all humans evolved in [[Africa]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tishkoff SA |title=The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans|journal=Science Xpress |month=April |year=2009|doi=10.1126/science.1172257|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1172257 |pmid=19407144 |volume=324 |issue=5930 |pages=1035–44 |pmc=2947357 |author-separator=, |author2=Reed FA |display-authors=2 |last3=Friedlaender |first3=F.

A. |last9=Bodo |first9=J.-M.}}</ref> then populated the rest of the world through successive radiations. It seems likely that the first modern humans had relatively large numbers of eumelanin-producing melanocytes.  In accordance, they had darker skin as with the indigenous people of Africa today. As some of these original peoples migrated and settled in areas of [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], the selective pressure for eumelanin production decreased in climates where radiation from the sun was less intense. Of the two common gene variants known to be associated with pale human skin, ''[[Mc1r]]''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harding RM |title=Evidence for variable selective pressures at MC1R |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1351–61 |year=2000 |month=April |pmid=10733465 |pmc=1288200 |doi=10.1086/302863 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Healy E |author3=Ray AJ |display-authors=3 |last4=Ellis |first4=Nichola S. |last5=Flanagan |first5=Niamh |last6=Todd |first6=Carol |last7=Dixon |first7=Craig |last8=Sajantila |first8=Antti |last9=Jackson |first9=Ian J.}}</ref> does not appear to have undergone positive selection, while ''[[SLC24A5]]''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lamason RL |title=SLC24A5, a putative cation exchanger, affects pigmentation in zebrafish and humans |journal=Science (New York, New York.) |volume=310 |issue=5755 |pages=1782–6 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16357253 |doi=10.1126/science.1116238 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Mohideen MA |author3=Mest JR |display-authors=3 |last4=Wong |first4=AC |last5=Norton |first5=HL |last6=Aros |first6=MC |last7=Jurynec |first7=MJ |last8=Mao |first8=X |last9=Humphreville |first9=VR}}</ref> has.

As with peoples having migrated northward, those with light skin migrating toward the equator acclimatize to the much stronger solar radiation. Most people's skin darkens when exposed to UV light, giving them more protection when it is needed. This is the physiological purpose of [[sun tanning]]. Dark-skinned people, who produce more skin-protecting eumelanin, have a greater protection against [[sunburn]] and the development of [[melanoma]], a potentially deadly form of [[skin cancer]], as well as other health problems related to exposure to strong [[solar radiation]], including the [[photodegradation]] of certain [[vitamin]]s such as [[riboflavin]]s, [[carotenoid]]s, [[tocopherol]], and [[folate]].

Melanin in the eyes, in the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and [[choroid]], helps protect them from [[ultraviolet]] and [[high-energy visible light|high-frequency visible light]]; people with [[Eye color|gray, blue, and green eyes]] are more at risk for sun-related eye problems. <!--
remainder of this paragraph is a tangent that could and probably should be deleted
--> Further, the ocular lens yellows with age, providing added protection. However, the lens also becomes more rigid with age, losing most of its [[accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] — the ability to change shape to focus from far to near — a detriment due probably to [[protein]] crosslinking caused by UV exposure.

Recent research by J.D. Simon ''et al.''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liu Y, Hong L, Kempf VR, Wakamatsu K, Ito S, Simon JD |title=Ion-exchange and adsorption of Fe(III) by Sepia melanin |journal=Pigment Cell Research |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=262–9 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15140071 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0749.2004.00140.x |url=}}</ref> suggests that melanin may serve a protective role other than photoprotection. Melanin is able to effectively [[Chemical ligation|ligate]] metal ions through its carboxylate and phenolic hydroxyl groups, in many cases much more efficiently than the powerful chelating ligand ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Thus, it may serve to sequester potentially toxic metal ions, protecting the rest of the cell. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the loss of neuromelanin observed in Parkinson's disease is accompanied by an increase in iron levels in the brain.
