'''Herpes simplex virus''' '''1''' and '''2''' ('''HSV-1''' and '''HSV-2'''), also known as '''Human herpes virus 1''' and '''2''' ('''HHV-1''' and '''-2'''), are two members of the herpes [[virus]] family, [[Herpesviridae]], that infect [[human]]s.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book| author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors)| title = Sherris Medical Microbiology| edition = 4th| pages = 555–62| publisher = McGraw Hill| year = 2004| isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> Both HSV-1 (which produces most cold sores) and HSV-2 (which produces most genital herpes) are [[wikt:ubiquitous|ubiquitous]] and [[Infectious disease|contagious]]. They can be spread when an infected person is producing and [[viral shedding|shedding]] the virus.

Symptoms of herpes simplex virus [[infection]] include watery [[blister]]s in the [[skin]] or [[mucous membranes]] of the mouth, lips or genitals.<ref name=Sherris /> Lesions heal with a [[Coagulation|scab]] characteristic of herpetic disease. Sometimes, the viruses cause very mild or atypical symptoms during outbreaks. However, as [[neurotropic virus|neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses]], HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by becoming ''latent'' and hiding from the [[immune system]] in the [[cell (biology)|cell]] bodies of [[neurons]]. After the initial or ''primary'' infection, some infected people experience [[wikt:sporadic|sporadic]] episodes of viral ''reactivation'' or ''outbreaks''. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transported via the neuron's [[axon]] to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and cause new sores.<ref>{{cite web | title=Herpes simplex | url=http://www.dermnetnz.org/viral/herpes-simplex.html | date=2006-09-16 | publisher=DermNet NZ&nbsp;— New Zealand Dermatological Society | accessdate=2006-10-15}}</ref>

==Transmission==
{{Main|Herpes simplex}}

HSV-1 and -2 are transmitted by contact with an infectious area of the skin during re-activations of the virus. Although less likely, the herpes viruses can be transmitted during latency. Transmission is likely to occur during symptomatic re-activation of the virus that causes visible and typical skin sores. Asymptomatic reactivation means that the virus causes atypical, subtle or hard to notice symptoms that are not identified as an active herpes infection. Atypical symptoms are often attributed to other causes such as a yeast infection.<ref name="pmid18156035">{{cite journal |author=Gupta R, Warren T, Wald A |title=Genital herpes |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9605 |pages=2127–37 |year=2007 |pmid=18156035 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61908-4}}</ref><ref name="PMID_18186706"/> HSV-1 is often acquired orally during childhood. It may also be sexually transmitted, including contact with saliva, such as [[kissing]] and mouth-to-genital contact ([[oral sex]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HERPES|url=http://medweb.mit.edu/wellness/programs/herpes.html}}</ref> HSV-2 is primarily a sexually transmitted infection but rates of HSV-1 genital infections are increasing.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>

Herpes simplex viruses can affect areas of skin exposed to contact with an infected person. An example of this is herpetic whitlow which is a herpes infection on the fingers. This was a common affliction of dental surgeons prior to the routine use of gloves when conducting treatment on patients.

==Microbiology==

===Viral structure===
Animal herpes viruses all share some common properties. The structure of herpes viruses consists of a relatively large double-stranded, linear [[DNA]] [[genome]] encased within an [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] protein cage called the [[capsid]], which is wrapped in a [[lipid bilayer]] called the [[Envelope (biology)|envelope]]. The envelope is joined to the capsid by means of a [[Viral tegument|tegument]]. This complete particle is known as the [[virion]].<ref name="pmid16814597">{{cite journal |author=Mettenleiter TC, Klupp BG, Granzow H |title=Herpesvirus assembly: a tale of two membranes |journal=Curr. Opin.

These genes and their functions are summarized in the table below.

The genomes of HSV1 and HSV2 are complex and contain two unique regions called the long unique region (U<sub>L</sub>) and the short unique region (U<sub>S</sub>). Of the 74 known ORFs, U<sub>L</sub> contains 56 viral genes, whereas U<sub>S</sub> contains only 12.<ref name="pmid16490275"/> Transcription of HSV genes is catalyzed by [[RNA polymerase II]] of the infected host.<ref name="pmid16490275"/> [[Immediate early gene]]s, which encode proteins that regulate the expression of ''early'' and ''late'' viral genes, are the first to be expressed following infection. [[early protein|Early gene]] expression follows, to allow the synthesis of [[enzyme]]s involved in [[DNA replication]] and the production of certain [[Viral envelope|envelope]] [[glycoprotein]]s. Expression of late genes occurs last; this group of genes predominantly encode proteins that form the virion particle.<ref name="pmid16490275"/>

Five proteins from (U<sub>L</sub>) form the viral capsid; [[HHV capsid portal protein|UL6]], UL18, UL35, UL38 and the major capsid protein UL19.<ref name="pmid16814597"/>

===Cellular entry===
[[File:HSV replication.png|thumb|right|350px|A simplified diagram of HSV replication]]
Entry of HSV into the host cell involves interactions of several [[glycoprotein]]s on the surface of the enveloped virus, with [[Transmembrane receptor|receptors]] on the surface of the host cell. The envelope covering the virus particle, when bound to specific receptors on the cell surface, will fuse with the host cell membrane and create an opening, or ''pore'', through which the virus enters the host cell.

The sequential stages of HSV entry are analogous to [[Viral entry|those of other viruses]]. At first, complementary receptors on the virus and the cell surface bring the viral and cell membranes into proximity. In an intermediate state, the two membranes begin to merge, forming a ''hemifusion state.'' Finally, a stable ''entry pore'' is formed through which the viral envelope contents are introduced to the host cell.<ref name="Subramanian_17299053">{{cite journal |author=Subramanian RP, Geraghty RJ |title=Herpes simplex virus type 1 mediates fusion through a hemifusion intermediate by sequential activity of glycoproteins D, H, L, and B |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=104 |issue=8 |pages=2903–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17299053 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0608374104 |pmc=1815279}}</ref>
In the case of a herpes virus, initial interactions occur when a viral envelope glycoprotein called glycoprotein C (gC) binds to a cell surface particle called [[heparan sulfate]]. A second glycoprotein, glycoprotein D (gD), binds specifically to at least one of [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122668866/PDFSTART three] known entry receptors. These include herpesvirus entry mediator([[TNFRSF14|HVEM]]), [[nectin]]-1 and 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate. The receptor provides a strong, fixed attachment to the host cell. These interactions bring the membrane surfaces into mutual proximity and allow for other glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope to interact with other cell surface molecules.
Once bound to the HVEM, gD changes its conformation and interacts with viral glycoproteins H (gH) and L (gL), which form a complex. The interaction of these membrane proteins results in the hemifusion state. Afterward, gB interaction with the gH/gL complex creates an entry pore for the viral capsid.<ref name="Subramanian_17299053"/> Glycoprotein B interacts with [[glycosaminoglycan]]s on the surface of the host cell.

===Genetic inoculation===
After the viral capsid enters the cellular [[cytoplasm]], it is transported to the [[cell nucleus]]. Once attached to the nucleus at a ''nuclear entry pore'', the capsid ejects its DNA contents via the capsid ''portal''. The capsid portal is formed by twelve copies of portal protein, UL6, arranged as a ring; the proteins contain a [[leucine zipper]] sequence of [[amino acids]] which allow them to adhere to each other.<ref name="pmid17188319">

===Immune evasion===
HSV evades the immune system through interference with MHC class I presentation of antigen on the cell surface. It achieves this through blockade of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)  induced by the secretion of ICP-47 by HSV.<ref>Abbas et al (2009) Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Elsevier Inc.</ref> In the host cell, TAP transports digested viral antigen epitopes from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing these epitopes to be combined with MHC class I molecules and presented on the surface of the cell. Viral epitope presentation with MHC class I is a requirement for activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), the major effectors of the cell-mediated immune response against virally-infected cells. ICP-47 prevents initiation of a CTL-response against HSV, allowing the virus to survive for a protracted period in the host.

===Replication===
[[File:Herpes simplex virus pap test.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing the viral [[cytopathic effect]] of HSV (multi-nucleation, ground glass chromatin).]]
Following infection of a cell, a cascade of herpes virus proteins, called ''immediate-early'', ''[[Early protein|early]]'', and ''late'', are produced. Research using [[flow cytometry]] on another member of the herpes virus family, [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]], indicates the possibility of an additional [[Lytic cycle|lytic stage]], ''delayed-late''.<ref name="PMID_17005685">{{cite journal |author=Adang LA, Parsons CH, Kedes DH |title=Asynchronous Progression through the Lytic Cascade and Variations in Intracellular Viral Loads Revealed by High-Throughput Single-Cell Analysis of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Infection |journal=J.

In the case of HSV-1, no protein products are detected during latency, whereas they are detected during the lytic cycle.

The early proteins transcribed are used in the regulation of genetic replication of the virus. On entering the cell, an α-TIF protein joins the viral particle and aids in immediate-[[Early protein|early]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. The virion host shutoff protein (VHS or UL41) is very important to viral replication.<ref name="pmid12083325"/> This enzyme shuts off protein synthesis in the host, degrades host [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]], helps in viral replication, and regulates [[gene expression]] of viral proteins. The viral genome immediately travels to the nucleus but the VHS protein remains in the cytoplasm.<ref name="pmid16940547">{{cite journal |author=Taddeo B, Roizman B |title=The Virion Host Shutoff Protein (UL41) of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Is an Endoribonuclease with a Substrate Specificity Similar to That of RNase A |journal=J.

The late proteins are used in to form the capsid and the receptors on the surface of the virus. Packaging of the viral particles&nbsp;— including the [[genome]], core and the [[capsid]] - occurs in the nucleus of the cell. Here, [[concatemer]]s of the viral genome are separated by cleavage and are placed into pre-formed capsids. HSV-1 undergoes a process of primary and secondary envelopment. The primary envelope is acquired by budding into the inner nuclear membrane of the cell. This then fuses with the outer nuclear membrane releasing a naked capsid into the cytoplasm. The virus acquires its final envelope by budding into cytoplasmic [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Granzow H, Klupp BG, Fuchs W, Veits J, Osterrieder N, Mettenleiter TC |title=Egress of Alphaherpesviruses: Comparative Ultrastructural Study |journal=J.

===Latent infection===
HSVs may persist in a quiescent but persistent form known as ''latent infection'', notably in [[Ganglion|neural ganglia]].<ref name=Sherris /> HSV-1 tends to reside in the [[trigeminal ganglion|trigeminal ganglia]], while HSV-2 tends to reside in the [[sacral ganglia]], but note that these are tendencies only, not fixed behavior. During such latent infection of a cell, HSVs express [[HHV LAT|Latency Associated Transcript (LAT)]] [[RNA]]. LAT is known to regulate the host cell genome and interferes with natural cell death mechanisms. By maintaining the host cells, LAT expression preserves a reservoir of the virus, which allows subsequent, usually symptomatic, periodic recurrences or "outbreaks" characteristic of non-latency. Whether or not recurrences are noticeable (symptomatic), viral shedding occurs to produce further infections (usually in a new host, if any). A protein found in [[neuron]]s may bind to herpes virus DNA and regulate [[Virus latency|latency]]. Herpes virus DNA contains a gene for a protein called ICP4, which is an important [[Transactivation|transactivator]] of genes associated with lytic infection in HSV-1.<ref name="PMID17555596">{{cite journal |author=Pinnoji RC, Bedadala GR, George B, Holland TC, Hill JM, Hsia SC |title=Repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor/neuronal restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) can regulate HSV-1 immediate-early transcription via histone modification |journal=Virol.

==Treatment and vaccine development==
:''For more details on treatment of herpes simplex virus, see [[Herpes simplex#Treatment|Herpes simplex]].''

Herpes viruses establish lifelong infections, and the virus cannot yet be eradicated from the body. Treatment usually involves general-purpose [[antiviral drug]]s that interfere with viral replication, reduce the physical severity of outbreak-associated lesions, and lower the chance of transmission to others. Studies of vulnerable patient populations have indicated that daily use of antivirals such as [[acyclovir]] and [[valacyclovir]] can reduce reactivation rates.<ref name="PMID_18186706">{{cite journal |author=Koelle DM, Corey L |title=Herpes simplex: insights on pathogenesis and possible vaccines |journal=Annual Review of Medicine |volume=59 |issue= |pages=381–95 |year=2008 |pmid=18186706 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.59.061606.095540}}</ref>

==Connection between facial sores and Alzheimer's disease==
In the presence of a certain gene variation ([[Apolipoprotein E|APOE]]-epsilon4 allele carriers), a possible link between HSV-1 (i.e., the virus that causes cold sores or oral herpes) and [[Alzheimer's disease]] was reported in 1979.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Middleton PJ, Petric M, Kozak M, Rewcastle NB, McLachlan DR |title=Herpes-simplex viral genome and senile and presenile dementias of Alzheimer and Pick |journal=Lancet |volume=315 |issue=8176 |pages=1038 |year=1980 |month=May |pmid=6103379 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(80)91490-7 |url=}}</ref> HSV-1 appears to be particularly damaging to the nervous system and increases one’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

Herpes simplex virus is considered as a potential therapy for cancer and has been extensively clinically tested to assess its [[oncolytic]] (cancer killing) ability.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Varghese|first=Susan|coauthors=Rabkin, Samuel D|title=Oncolytic herpes simplex virus vectors for cancer virotherapy|journal=Cancer Gene Therapy|date=1 December 2002|volume=9|issue=12|pages=967–978|doi=10.1038/sj.cgt.7700537|url=http://www.nature.com/cgt/journal/v9/n12/full/7700537a.html}}</ref>
