'''Brodmann area 11''' is one of [[Korbinian Brodmann|Brodmann's]] [[Cell biology|cytologically]] defined [[Brodmann area|regions of the brain]].  It is involved in planning, reasoning, and decision making.

==Human==
'''Brodmann area 11''', or BA11, is part of the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] [[cerebral cortex | cortex]] in the [[human brain]]. BA11 covers the medial part of the ventral surface of the frontal lobe.

'''Prefrontal area 11 of Brodmann-1909''' is a subdivision of the frontal lobe in the human defined on the basis of [[cytoarchitecture]]. Defined and illustrated in Brodmann-1909, it included the areas subsequently illustrated in Brodmann-10 as prefrontal area 11 and rostral area 12. 

'''prefrontal area 11''' is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex of the human. As illustrated in Brodmann-10, It constitutes most of the [[orbital gyri]], [[gyrus rectus]] and the most rostral portion of the [[superior frontal gyrus]]. It is bounded medially by the [[inferior rostral sulcus]] (H) and laterally approximately by the [[frontomarginal sulcus]] (H). Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded on the rostral and lateral aspects of the hemisphere by the [[frontopolar area 10]], the [[orbital area 47]], and the [[triangular area 45]]; on the medial surface it is bounded dorsally by the [[rostral area 12]] and caudally by the [[subgenual area 25]]. In an earlier map, the area labeled 11, i.e., prefrontal [[area 11 of Brodmann]]-1909, was larger; it included the area now designated rostral area 12.  

==Guenon==
'''Brodmann area 11''' is a subdivision of the frontal lobe of the [[guenon]] defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture (Brodmann-1905). Distinctive features: area 11 lacks an internal [[granular layer]] (IV); larger [[pyramidal cell]]s of sublayer 3b of the external [[pyramidal layer]] (III) merge with a denser self-contained collection of cells in the internal pyramidal layer (V); similar to [[area 10 of Brodmann]]-1909 is the presence in the [[multiform layer]] (VI) of trains of cells oriented parallel to the cortical surface separated by acellular fiber bundles; a thick [[molecular layer]] (I); a relatively narrow overall cortical thickness; and a gradual transition from the [[multiform layer]] (VI) to the subcortical [[white matter]].
