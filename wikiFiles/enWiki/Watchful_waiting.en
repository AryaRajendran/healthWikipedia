'''Watchful waiting''' (also '''watch and wait''' or '''WAW''') is an approach to a [[medicine|medical]] problem in which time is allowed to pass before medical intervention or therapy is used.  During this time, repeated [[medical test|testing]] may be performed.

A distinction can be drawn between ''watchful waiting'' and ''medical observation'',<ref name="urlAustralian Prostate Cancer Website">{{cite web |url=http://www.prostatehealth.org.au/phip_4.html?PHPSESSID=e1db774b4be02970795b9b7b95d7fb68#MonitoringNoTreatment |title=Australian Prostate Cancer Website |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> but some sources equate the terms.<ref name="urlProstate cancer guide - MayoClinic.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/prostate-cancer/PC99999/PAGE=PC00018 |title=Prostate cancer guide - MayoClinic.com |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="urlDefinition of watchful waiting - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms">{{cite web |url=http://nci.nih.gov/templates/db_alpha.aspx?CdrID=45942 |title=Definition of watchful waiting - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Usually, watchful waiting is an [[outpatient]] process and it may have a duration of months or years.  In contrast, [[medical observation]] usually is an [[inpatient]] process, often involving frequent or even continuous monitoring, and may have a duration of hours or days.

==Uses==
Often watchful waiting is recommended in situations with a high likelihood of self-resolution, in situations where there is high uncertainty concerning the diagnosis, and in situations where the risks of intervention or therapy may outweigh the benefits. 

Watchful waiting is often recommended for many common illnesses such as [[otitis media|ear infections]];<ref>[http://www.aap.org/healthtopics/earinfections.cfm American Academy of Pediatrics]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> because the majority of cases resolve spontaneously, [[antibiotic]]s will often be prescribed only after several days of [[symptoms]]. It is also a strategy frequently used in [[surgery]] prior to a possible operation,<ref name="pmid16636325">{{cite journal |author=Kendall C, Murray S |title=Is watchful waiting a reasonable approach for men with minimally symptomatic inguinal hernia? |journal=CMAJ |volume=174 |issue=9 |pages=1263–4 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16636325 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.060299 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16636325 |pmc=1435959}}</ref> when it is possible for a symptom (for example [[abdominal pain]]) to either improve naturally or become worse.

==Process==

===Watchful waiting===
In many applications, a key component of watchful waiting is the use of an explicit [[decision tree]] or other protocol to ensure a timely transition from watchful waiting to another form of management, as needed.<ref name="pmid1433687">{{cite journal |author=Katz DA, Littenberg B, Cronenwett JL |title=Management of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. Early surgery vs watchful waiting |journal=JAMA |volume=268 |issue=19 |pages=2678–86 |year=1992 |month=November |pmid=1433687 |doi= 10.1001/jama.268.19.2678|url=}}</ref>  This is particularly common in the post-surgical management of cancer survivors, in whom cancer recurrence is a significant concern.

===Medical observation===
Usually, patients in observation, according to hospital policy, are only kept in observation for 24 or 48 hours before they will be discharged or admitted as an inpatient. Insurance can play a role in how "observation" is defined (for example, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] (US) does not support observation services for over 48 hours).<ref name="urlGundersen Lutheran - What is Outpatient Observation?">{{cite web |url=http://www.gundluth.org/web/misc/pbs.nsf/8a155831a7ba541b8625703600655a76/c850b081fba94992862572fa006013b9!OpenDocument |title=Gundersen Lutheran - What is Outpatient Observation? |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>
