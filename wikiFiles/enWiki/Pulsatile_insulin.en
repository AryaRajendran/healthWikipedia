'''Pulsatile insulin''', sometimes called '''metabolic activation therapy''', or '''cellular activation therapy''' describes in a literal sense the intravenous injection of [[insulin]] in pulses versus continuous infusions. Injection of insulin in pulses mimics the physiological secretions of insulin by the [[pancreas]] into the [[portal vein]] which then drains into the [[liver]]. In healthy, non-diabetic individuals, pancreatic secretions of insulin correspond to the intake of food. The pancreas will secrete variable amounts of insulin based upon the amount of food consumed (basically speaking, the more food that is consumed, the more insulin the pancreas will secrete) among other factors. The majority of available experimental evidence suggests a more potent [[hypoglycemic]] effect of pulsatile insulin in comparison to continuous insulin infusion. Continuous exposure to insulin and [[glucagon]] is known to decrease the hormones’ metabolic effectiveness on [[glucose]] production in [[humans]] due to the body developing an increased tolerance to the hormones. Down-regulation at the [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] level may partially explain the decreased action of steady-state levels of insulin, while pulsatile [[hormone]] secretion may allow recovery of [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] affinity and numbers for insulin. Intermittent intravenous insulin administration with peaks of insulin concentrations may enhance suppression of [[gluconeogenesis]] and reduce [[hepatic]] glucose production.

== Background==

Dr. Thomas Aoki, former Head of [[Metabolism]] Research at the [[Joslin Diabetes Center]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and a current Professor of Medicine at the [[University of California, Davis]], was the pioneer of using pulsatile insulin in the treatment of diabetes. Dr. Aoki’s work focused on the role of [[liver]] dysfunction in diabetic metabolism. He theorized that end [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] damage in diabetes is caused by abnormal hepatic glucose metabolism, inadequate insulin delivery, and insulin resistance.

== Pulsatile Insulin and the Liver==

Normally, insulin is secreted from the pancreas in pulses into the [[portal vein]] which brings blood into the liver in variable amounts, closely related to [[ingestion]] of meals. For induction and maintenance of insulin-dependent [[enzymes]] essential for glucose metabolism in the liver (e.g. [[hepatic glucokinase]], [[phosphofructokinase]], and [[pyruvate kinase]]), the [[hepatocytes]] require a defined insulin level (200-500 µU/ml in the [[portal vein]]) concomitant with high glucose levels (which acts as a bimolecular signal). In non-diabetic subjects, portal insulin concentrations are twofold to threefold greater than those in the peripheral circulation. During the first pass through the liver, 50% of the insulin is removed, strongly insinuating that the liver is the principal metabolic target organ of the [[gastrointestinal]] tract and the pancreas. The insulin retained by the hepatocytes may itself be essential for the long-term effects of insulin on hepatic glucose metabolism as well as growth and de novo enzyme synthesis. Following oral glucose intake, the liver accounts for an equal or greater portion of total net glucose uptake compared to the periphery. Insulin exerts pivotal control of glucose levels through its ability to regulate hepatic glucose production directly or indirectly. The traditional subcutaneous (S.C.) insulin administration regimens used by diabetic patients a) fails to capture the pulsatile nature of natural insulin secretion and b) does not reach high enough insulin concentrations at the hepatocyte level (e.g., 10 U regular insulin injected S.C. produce a peak systemic circulation concentration of 30-40 µU/ml and an even lower portal vein concentration of 15-20 µU/ml).

== Controversy over efficacy ==

There is disagreement about whether this therapy benefits patients. Many insurers refuse to cover the treatment. Several literature reviews by insurers conclude that there is no evidence of efficacy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hepatic Activation Therapy|url=http://www.anthem.com/medicalpolicies/policies/mp_pw_a050507.htm|publisher=Anthem Blue Cross|accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Clinical Policy Bulletin: Intermittent Intravenous Insulin Therapy|url=http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/700_799/0742.html|publisher=Aetna|accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Outpatient Intravenous Insulin Therapy (OIVIT)|url=http://blue.regence.com/trgmedpol/medicine/med96.html|publisher=Blue Regence|accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Intermittent Intravenous Insulin Therapy|url=https://www.oxhp.com/secure/policy/intermittent_iv_insulin_therapy_411.html|publisher=UnitedHealthcare|accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> 

A number of investigators have found no physiologic benefit from pulsatile delivery.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grubert|first=J.

In some cases, insurance companies have been ordered to pay for that patient. For example, a trial with [[CalPERS]] resulted in a decision ordering Blue Cross and other insurance providers to pay for the therapy as to those parties.
