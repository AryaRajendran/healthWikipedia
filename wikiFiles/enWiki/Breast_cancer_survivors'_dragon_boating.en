'''Breast cancer survivors' dragon boating''' is an international movement inspired by the research of Canadian [[sports medicine]] specialist '''Don McKenzie'''. Survivors of [[breast cancer]] join together to paddle [[dragon boat]]s to the benefit of their physical health and social wellbeing.

==Research==
Donald Chisholm ("Don") McKenzie is a Canadian sports medicine specialist at the [[University of British Columbia]], professor in the School of Kinesiology<ref>{{cite web|title=School of Kinesiology: Don McKenzie|url=http://kin.educ.ubc.ca/don-mckenzie|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref> and Director of the Allan McGavin Sports Medicine Centre.<ref>{{cite web|title=Allan McGavin Sports Medicine Centre: People |url=http://www.ubcsportsmedicine.ca/people/|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref> In a 1998 paper in the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' McKenzie described how in February 1996 he started a dragon boat team for women with a history of breast cancer, which the women chose to name Abreast in a Boat.<ref name=mckenzie>{{cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Donald C.|title=Abreast in a Boat&nbsp;– a race against breast cancer|journal=[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]|year=1998|month=August|volume=159|pages=376–378|url=http://www.canadianmedicaljournal.ca/content/159/4/376.full.pdf |accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref> He believed that this activity would benefit breast cancer survivors as it provided strenuous upper body activity in an aesthetically pleasing and socially supportive environment.<ref name=mckenzie />

His paper<ref name=mckenzie /> concludes:
{{block quote|How important is the Abreast in a Boat project? It is an
approach to promoting health and raising breast cancer
awareness that is driven by women with the disease. It
reaches out to other women and offers them a message of
hope and support. It is helping to change attitudes toward
“life after breast cancer,” and it encourages women to lead
full and active lives. It is making a difference.}}

In 2001 McKenzie was awarded the [[Meritorious Service Medal (Canada)|Meritorious Service Medal]] for his work with Abreast In A Boat. The citation ended with the words: "His remarkable achievements, enhanced by his guidance and caring, have given breast cancer survivors across Canada a sense of confidence and pride, and a lifeline to a better existence."<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Donald Chisholm McKenzie, M.S.M.|url=http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=447&t=8&ln=McKenzie|publisher=Governor General of Canada | work= Meritorious Service Decorations (civilian division)|accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref>

Later research published by Mitchell et al concluded that: "The interview data support the emerging hypothesis that dragon boating is a vehicle for improving women's wellness and post-treatment quality of life."<ref name=mitchell>{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=J L|coauthors=et al|title=Survivor Dragon Boating: A Vehicle to Reclaim and Enhance Life After Treatment for Breast Cancer |journal=Health Care for Women International |year=2007|volume=28|issue=2|doi=10.1080/07399330601128445|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07399330601128445|accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref>
