'''''Agaricus xanthodermus''''', commonly known as the '''yellow-staining mushroom''' or simply the '''yellow-stainer''',<ref name=Phillips/> is a [[mushroom]] of the
genus ''[[Agaricus]]'', which displays a strong yellow colouration at the base of the stem when cut.  It is poisonous for most people, causing gastrointestinal upset,  but can be eaten by some without apparent negative effect.

==Taxonomy==
This species was first officially defined under the name ''Agaricus xanthodermus'' in 1876 by Léon Gaston Genevier, in a letter published in the bulletin of the [[Société botanique de France|French Botanical Society]].<ref name=SBF/><ref name=IndexFungorum/>  Genevier described the ''[[Agaricus]]'' mushrooms commonly eaten (perhaps sometimes inadvisedly) in the region of [[Nantes]], and attempted to clarify the distinctions between them.  He proposed a detailed reclassification into 5 species, including this new one.  Apparently up until that time, these yellow-staining mushrooms were considered to be just varieties of other species which are edible: ''[[Agaricus arvensis|A. arvensis]]'', ''[http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=508604 A. edulis]'', and ''[[Agaricus silvicola|A. silvicola]]''.<ref name=Genevier/>

The epithet ''xanthodermus'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words for "yellow" and "skin", which were then given a Latin adjective ending.  This is the official name, but the form ''Agaricus xanthoderma'' is also often seen.<ref name="Bon"/><ref name="Courtecuisse"/><ref name=Moser/>  In the latter name, ''-derma'' "skin" is a neuter noun which does not have to agree in gender with ''Agaricus'', and so this form is legal according to the rules of botanical nomenclature.<ref name="Nomenclature"/>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is generally 6–10&nbsp;cm (2.4–4&nbsp;in) in diameter, though can reach 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in). It is initially convex, with some young specimens having a squarish shape, though flattening with age. It is whitish, with light brown tints towards the centre. The cap is dry and smooth, but can be scaly when old. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] of this mushroom progress from pale-pink to a chocolate color. The spore print is brown. Its white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is bulbous with a skirt-like ring. Microscopically, the [[Cystidium|cheilocystidia]] are club-shaped.  The spores are 6-7×3-4&nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]].

The main identifying feature is an immediate bright yellow colouration on cutting through the base of the stem, or scraping the flesh; later,  the affected area fades to a dull brown.  Numerous edible ''Agaricus'' species, such as ''[[Agaricus augustus|A. augustus]]'', ''[[Agaricus arvensis|A. arvensis]]'' and ''[[Agaricus silvicola|A. silvicola]]'', turn yellow to a greater or lesser extent, but they do not display such an intense reaction.

''Agaricus xanthodermus'' has an unpleasant characteristic smell, which is phenolic, reminiscent of ink or [[carbolic soap]].  The smell is especially strong at the base of the stem.

This mushroom is very common and widely distributed in [[North America]], [[Europe]], West Asia including eastern [[Anatolia]]<ref name=Dem04/> and Iran,<ref name=Asef2010/> North Africa,<ref name="Courtecuisse"/> and [[southern Africa]].<ref name=Westhuizen/>  It has been introduced into [[Australia]]. It occurs in woods, lawns, gardens and hedgerows in autumn. This is a [[saprobic]] species.

==Poisonous character==
It appears that some people can eat this mushroom without ill effects,<ref name=Phillips/><ref name=Genevier/><ref name=Jordan/> but it can cause serious gastric problems. It is indigestible and gives rise to symptoms of  sweating, flushing, and severe stomach cramps.<ref name=Phillips/><ref name=Bon/><ref name=Jordan/>

Of those who gather ''Agaricus''-style mushrooms, about 50% of the cases of poisoning are from this species. On cooking, the smell becomes very noticeable, and this may deter people from eating it inadvertently.<ref name=Jordan/>

==Related species==
''A. xanthodermus'' belongs to a group of related species  (the "Xanthodermatei") which likewise discolour bright yellow and have a phenolic smell.  They include ''A. praeclaresquamosus'' (formerly ''[[Agaricus placomyces|A. placomyces]]'') which has dark grey scales, ''[[Agaricus moelleri|A. moelleri]]'', and ''[[Agaricus pilatianus|A. pilatianus]]'', which does not have a bulbous stem.<ref name="Courtecuisse"/>

<ref name="Nomenclature">Binomial names may take the form "noun + adjective", "noun + nominative noun" or "noun + genitive noun" as explained in [[Binomial nomenclature#Derivation of binomial names|this section of the Binomial nomenclature article]].  There is agreement in gender only in the "noun + adjective" case (as in ''Agaricus xanthodermus'', which means something like "yellow-skinned Agaricus"), but ''Agaricus xanthoderma'' is the second type (like "Agaricus yellow-skin") and there the endings do not agree.  Another similar example is ''[[Agaricus silvicola]]'' (which means "Agaricus, inhabitant of the woods").</ref>
