[[File:Edward Bliss Foote.jpg|thumb|Edward Bliss Foote designed an early form of barrier contraception that he called the "womb veil"]]
The '''womb veil''' was a 19th-century American form of [[barrier contraception]] consisting of an occlusive [[pessary]] made of [[rubber]]. It was a forerunner to the modern [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] and [[cervical cap]].<ref name=brodiep216>Janet Farrell Brodie, ''Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America'' (Cornell University Press, 1994), p. 216 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Wbeoi0rGvpkC&pg=PA216&dq=%22womb+veil%22+inauthor:brodie&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22%20inauthor%3Abrodie&f=false online]; Andrea Tone, ''Devices and Desires: A History of Contraceptives in America'' (MacMillan, 2001), p. 14.

The use of rubber pessaries for contraception likely arose from the 19th-century practice of correcting a [[uterine prolapse|prolapsed uterus]] with such a device; the condition seems to have been far more frequently diagnosed than its incidence would warrant, and at times may have been a fiction for employing a pessary for birth control.<ref>Angus McLaren, "Birth Control: The Diaphragm," in ''Eyewitness to Science'' (Harvard University Press, 1995), p. 175; Katz, "The History of Birth Control in the United States," p. 91.</ref> As with the production of [[condom]]s for men, the development of [[vulcanized rubber]] by [[Charles Goodyear]] helped make barrier contraceptives for women more reliable and inexpensive.<ref>Patricia Aikens Murphy, Katherine Morgan, and Frances E.

==Social history==
The [[Popular Health Movement]] of the [[Jacksonian Democracy|Jacksonian era]] encouraged the sharing of knowledge about contraception, and contraceptive devices were advertised openly in newspaper ads and in brochures throughout the first half of the 19th century.<ref>Adele Clark, ''Disciplining Reproduction: Modernity, American Life Sciences, and the Problems of Sex'' (University of California Press, 1998), p. 167 [http://books.google.com/books?id=I4ClMZgui7sC&pg=PA167&dq=%22womb+veils%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=7#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veils%22&f=false online.]</ref> Among their proponents was the physician Edward Bliss Foote. Foote introduced his device, the womb veil, in a self-published book entitled ''Medical Common Sense'':

<blockquote>
This consists of an [[natural rubber|India-rubber]] contrivance which the female easily adjusts in the vagina ''before'' copulation, and which spreads a thin tissue of rubber before the mouth of the womb so as to prevent the [[semen|seminal]] aura from entering. … Conception cannot possibly take place when it is used. The full enjoyment of the conjugal embrace can be indulged in during coition. The husband would hardly be likely to know that it was being used, unless told by the wife. … It places conception entirely under the control of the wife, to whom it naturally belongs; for it is for her to say at what time and under what circumstances, she will become the mother, and the moral, religious, and physical instructress of offpsring.<ref name="Foote1863">{{cite book|title=Medical Common Sense; Applied to the Causes, Prevention, and Cure of Chronic Diseases and Unhappiness in Marriage|first=Edward Bliss|last=Foote|year=1863|location=New York|page=380|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iNRkAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA380#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>See also discussion by Brodie, ''Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America'', p. 218.</ref>

[[File:Emma Goldman seated.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Emma Goldman]] was among those who promoted the use of "womb veils" as contraception]]
Foote appears to have been the first to use the term "womb veil", in introducing his vaginal diaphragm in 1863.<ref>Lee L. Bean, Geraldine P. Mineau, and Douglas L. Anderton, ''Fertility Change on the American Frontier: Adaptation and Innovation'' (University of California Press, 1990), p. 30 [http://books.google.com/books?id=POER_tq5wtoC&pg=PA30&dq=%22womb+veil%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=68#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22&f=false  online]; Vern L.

Atwater Collection of American Popular Medicine and Health Reform'' (University of Rochester Press, 2001), vol. 1, p. 335 [http://books.google.com/books?id=qTlb22FcjBIC&pg=PA335&dq=%22womb+veil%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=31#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22&f=false online.]</ref> Foote touted his device as "the only reliable means yet discovered for the prevention of conception," and sold it "closely sealed" through the mail at a cost of $6. Foote may have gotten the idea for his device from an 1838 German treatise on cervical caps, or from acquaintance with the German tradition of [[midwifery]] that had been brought to the United States.<ref>Brodie, ''Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America'', p. 218.</ref> Although he mentions his intention to obtain a [[patent]], none is recorded.<ref>Michael Sappol, ''A Traffic of Dead Bodies: Anatomy and Embodied Social Identity in Nineteenth-Century America'' (Princeton University Press, 2002), p. 369.</ref>

"Succinct, straightforward" advertising for birth control devices, as well as for [[aphrodisiac]]s and drugs to induce abortion and cure [[venereal disease]], had been common in newspapers of the 1830s and 40s.<ref>Brodie, ''Contraception and Abortion'', p. 190.</ref> But in 1873, the [[Comstock laws]] made it illegal to disseminate information about contraception.<ref>Lis Harris, ''Rules of Engagement: Four Couples and American Marriage Today'' (Simon & Schuster, 1995), p. 106 [http://books.google.com/books?id=nEzW0ieqw7kC&pg=RA1-PA106&dq=%22womb+veils%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=14#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veils%22&f=false online.] As Brodie, ''Contraception and Abortion'', pp. 191–192, notes, even "eminently respectable" publications were subject to accusations. For an editorial fulmination against advertising various remedies for [[gonorrhea]] and [[impotence]], with greater indignation directed at even the possibility of exposure to ads for condoms and womb veils ("this literature of sin, a fertile source of immorality"), see "Death to Quacks," ''Toledo Medical and Surgical Journal'' 2 (1878), pp. 415–416 [http://books.google.com/books?id=_0agAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA416&dq=%22womb+veils%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=37#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veils%22&f=false online.]</ref> The following year, Foote was arrested and convicted under Comstock.<ref>John D'Emilio and Estelle B.

In March 1878, [[Anthony Comstock]] himself raided a druggist and seized an inventory that included six womb veils; another arrest netted 150.</ref> Although contraceptive information in popular media was curtailed, technical and medical journals and textbooks were not subject to this regulation, and physicians continued to discuss both issues and technologies pertaining to birth control.<ref>Katz, "The History of Birth Control in the United States," p. 91.</ref>

The early 20th century saw a resurgence of interest in birth control in the United States, due largely to the efforts of [[Margaret Sanger]] and other social activists. One of the most outspoken advocates for contraception during this time was [[Emma Goldman]], who openly defied the Comstock laws by recommending the womb veil in leaflets she distributed after her lectures.<ref>Including ''Why and How the Poor Should Not Have Many Children''; see Linda Gordon, ''The Moral Property of Women: A History of Birth Control Politics in America'' (University of Illinois Press, 1974, 2002), p. 148 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Hwh2wGplDc4C&pg=PA148&dq=%22Goldman+and+Reitman+distributed+a+small,+four-page+pamphlet%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22Goldman%20and%20Reitman%20distributed%20a%20small%2C%20four-page%20pamphlet%22&f=false  online], and Ellen Chesler, ''Woman of Valor: Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America'' (Simon & Schuster, 1992, 2007), p. 88.</ref>

==Efficacy and side effects ==
The womb veil, described in medical [[Latin]] as a type of ''pessarium occlusivum'', was considered by some medical authorities to be effective if fitted and inserted correctly. Post-coital douching was often recommended in conjunction with its use.<ref>F.E. Chandler, review of ''Die Mittel zur Verhuetung der Conception'' by Jans Ferdy (Heuser, n.d.), in ''The Medical Times and Register'' 32 (1896), p. 258 [http://books.google.com/books?id=2dpXAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA258&dq=%22womb+veil%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=35#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22&f=false online.]</ref> Prolonged use of the device was reported on occasion to produce side effects, some of which pointed toward a need for better hygiene.<ref>"Simple erosions, such as arise from the mechanical irritation of a pessary, or from the pent-up secretions incident to the wearing of a womb-veil, are quickly cured by removing the cause and keeping the parts clean": David Tod Gilliam, ''A Text-book of Practical Gynecology'' (1916, 5th ed.), p. 237 [http://books.google.com/books?id=8nZdZL13T04C&pg=PA237&dq=%22womb+veil%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=140#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22&f=false online.] Similar report of "gastric disturbance" that was relieved by removal of the womb veil, releasing "an accumulation of a creamy fluid," verbal reports given 8 February 1887 as published in ''The American Lancet'' 11 (1887), p. 177 [http://books.google.com/books?id=7jZYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA177&dq=%22womb+veil%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=79#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22&f=false online.]</ref> Serious ulcerations were reported among those who wore it too long or without proper care.<ref>''Kansas Medical Journal'', 23 January 1897, p. 47 [http://books.google.com/books?id=x1sWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA47&dq=%22womb+veil%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=85#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22&f=false online.]</ref> In a report to the New Haven Medical Association, one doctor blamed the womb veil for a woman's nocturnal [[seizure]]s.<ref>Medical society reports, ''Yale Medical Journal'' 7 (1900–1901), pp. 329–330 [http://books.google.com/books?id=AjOgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA330&dq=%22womb+veil%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=39#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22&f=false online.]</ref> A gynecologist noted that the rubber womb veil might cause irritation or itching, but reckoned that the "opportunity for increased or unlimited intercourse" was the proximate cause.<ref>William A.

One physican found the womb veil to be "harmless" and likely "effectual" in some cases, but thought it relied too much on women knowing how to insert it correctly, with the possibility that it might become dislodged during intercourse.<ref>Chunn, "The Prevention of Conception," p. 83 [http://books.google.com/books?id=h7VXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA83&dq=%22womb+veil%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=89#v=onepage&q=&f=false  online.]</ref> Concerns about displacement of the womb veil, as well as irritation and loss of pleasurable sensation, were also expressed by the author of a 1912 book on human sexuality.<ref>Joseph Richardson Parke, ''Human Sexuality: A Medico-Literary Treatise on the History and Pathology of the Sex Instinct for the Use of Physicians and Jurists'' (Philadelphia, 1912), p. 176 [http://books.google.com/books?id=beqd8QBd9wUC&pg=PA176&dq=%22womb+veil%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=4#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22&f=false online.]</ref> The element of unreliability was recognized in the literature distributed by Emma Goldman.<ref>Gordon, ''The Moral Property of Women'', p. 148.</ref>

Concerns about fit were addressed by offering over-the-counter womb veils labeled by size, though not in a standardized way: "big" and "small," "one-size-fits-all," and "mothers' size" were some of the terms used. Symptoms such as cramping, abdominal pain, ulceration, and urinary tract infections were likely to have been caused by a too-large womb veil. The risk of dispacement and consequent pregnancy was increased by a veil too small. By comparison, modern diaphragms require cervical measurement and a prescription from a medical practitioner, and range in size from 50 to 95 millimeters.<ref>Tone, ''Devices and Desires'', p. 74.</ref> 

Noting that "any preventive will fail if not applied properly," the New York physician and [[free love|free-love]] advocate<ref>Rotter was the author of ''The Sexes and Love in Freedom'' and ''Jealousy, the Foe of Freedom''; see ad in Dora Forster's ''Sex Radicalism: As Seen by an Emancipated Woman of the New Time'' (Chicago, 1905), pp. 59 and 60 [http://books.google.com/books?id=DTFYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA60&dq=%22Oscar+Rotter%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=5#v=onepage&q=%22Oscar%20Rotter%22&f=false  online.]</ref> [[Oscar Rotter]] offered these instructions:

<blockquote>
For introduction, the woman is to sit down, so to say, on her heels, with her legs spread apart, which will bring the womb down as low as possible. Then taking the womb veil into the right hand with the cavity looking upward and compressed from side to side, giving it thus the shape of an ellipse, she has to push it up the vagina as far as it will go. It will then spread out of its own accord and apply itself closely and firmly to the neck of the womb.<ref>Oscar Rotter, "Means of Preventing Conception," ''The Medical World'' 15 (1897), pp. 151–152 [http://books.google.com/books?id=bstXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA152&dq=%22womb+veil%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22&f=false online.]</ref>
</blockquote>

Rotter also recommended that the veil be used in conjunction with a [[spermicide]] ointment made from [[muriate]] of [[quinine]] and [[vaseline]].<ref>Rotter uses the lowercase form for "vaseline."</ref> Instructions for removal and hygiene followed.

Rotter was an enthusiastic if careful proponent of the womb veil. Writing in 1897, he recommended pessaries made in England as of the highest quality, with those from Germany also satisfactory. The American in his view were the most poorly made, an inferiority he blamed on the restrictive Comstock laws that drove manufacture and sale underground: "In England, however, where such goods are openly advertised and sold, competition tends to secure the [[survival of the fittest]], and hence it is better to import them from that country." Until legal prohibitions limiting commercial production and distribution were lessened in the 1920s, reputable companies would manufacture devices for contraception only as a discreet sideline. Small-scale entrepreneurs, not excluding [[black market]]eers, stepped in to produce womb veils among other taboo items intended if not explicitly labeled as birth control.<ref>Tone, ''Devices and Desires'', pp. 48–49. Among those retailers subjected to raids and confiscations was an Irishman arrested in 1881 for selling contraceptives from a one-room shop at 489 Grand Street, New York City; his seized stock included 11 womb veils; see Brodie, ''Contraception and Abortion'', p. 235.</ref> For women too poor to buy quality contraception, Rotter also described how to make a homemade device from a rubber ball.<ref>Rotter, "Means of Preventing Conception," pp. 151–152.</ref>

==Moral and racialist aspects==
The Comstock ban on advertising contraceptive devices, which included womb veils, was not intended to protect consumers from false claims of efficacy, but from exposure to indecency. One editorial writer specifically asserted that even if the ads made true statements, the "anger and indignation of respectable people" at finding such products in their daily newspaper would be grounds to ban them.<ref>Unsigned editorial, ''Saint Paul Medical Journal'' 3 (1901), p. 687 [http://books.google.com/books?id=6DygAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA687&dq=%22womb+veils%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=49#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veils%22&f=false  online.]</ref> At Foote's trial, [[Anthony Comstock]] himself testified that the womb veil was "an instrument of death both moral and physical to the youth of the land."<ref>Janice Ruth Wood, ''The Struggle for Free Speech in the United States, 1872–1915: Edward Bliss Foote, Edward Bond Foote, and Anti-Comstock Operations'' (Routledge, 2008), p. 67 [http://books.google.com/books?id=yXUdUPiJ6oMC&pg=PA67&dq=%22The+dispute+between+the+Footes+and+Comstock%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22The%20dispute%20between%20the%20Footes%20and%20Comstock%22&f=false online.]</ref>

The use of womb veils, like other forms of contraception, was thus subject to moral condemnation. In his ''Ladies' Guide in Health and Disease'', [[John Harvey Kellogg]] asserted several legitimate reasons for [[family planning]], but considered womb veils and other technological forms of birth control to be harmful both physically and psychologically, causing women to lose "all respect for the sacredness of the maternal function."<ref>[[John Harvey Kellogg]], ''Ladies' Guide in Health and Disease: Girlhood, Maidenhood, Wifehood, Motherhood'' (Battle Creek, Michigan, 1901), pp. 345–351, on womb veils p. 349 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ilf06zADQ1AC&pg=PA349&dq=%22womb+veils%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=32#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veils%22&f=false  online.]</ref> The author of a ''Hand-book to [[Obstetrics]]'' (1908) opined:

<blockquote>
I think there is a growing distaste for the family duties among women … that should be condemned. The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, etc., while still claiming their sex privileges, with the dissolution of club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This ought not to be. Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one sole and single purpose, any departure therefrom being done at the violation of her best ideals and a misdirection of energy.<ref>Rawlins Cadwallader, ''Hand-book of Obstetrics'' (1908), p. 260.</ref>
</blockquote>

The author finds the [[rhythm method]] ineffective, since "for the female, [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] and [[menstruation]] are the same." He further disapproves of [[coitus interruptus|withdrawal]], warning that the latter would lead to "nervous collapse" and noting that "it is infinitely worse than [[masturbation]]."<ref>Cadwallader, ''Hand-book of Obstetrics'', p. 260. Kellogg had also compared birth control measures to "self-abuse" (p. 351).</ref> The perceived immorality of contraceptive devices was linked to the fear that they might enhance sexual pleasure; like masturbation, the use of womb veils, condoms, and other appliances might "heighten the feeling," but "there is no contact of the parts, and it is morally pernicious and degrading." Because these devices removed the fear of conception, they were said to foster a "positive invitation to illicit intercourse."<ref>Cadwallader, ''Hand-book of Obstetrics'', p. 261.</ref> Although in general douching was more acceptable,<ref>Cadwallader, ''Hand-book of Obstetrics'', p. 261; Herrick, "Abortion and Its Lessons," p. 10.</ref> even ads for "syringes" could be condemned as being "as hurtful to public morals and children's education as if they advertised condoms and womb veils."<ref>John F. Edgar, "Correspondence: The Way of the Irregular, of Any School of Practice, Is Full of Chaos and Boomerangs," "The Medical Forum: A Monthly Journal Devoted to the Interests of the Medical Profession'' 2 (1905), p. 329 [http://books.google.com/books?id=TL9XAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA329&dq=%22womb+veils%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=31#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veils%22&f=false online.]</ref>

Although birth control was sometimes advocated as a way for the poor to manage their resources better by limiting the size of their family, it could also be promoted for controlling social groups seen as inferior.<ref>On race, class, modernity, and urbanization as factors in perceptions of birth control, see Katz, "The History of Birth Control in the United States," ''passim''; Tone, ''Devices and Desires'', p. 145ff. More broadly on the subject of [[eugenics]], [[feminism]], and race, see Gordon, ''The Moral Property of Women'', p. 80ff.</ref> Observing that a couple "swept away by passion" might not think to take precautions such as inserting a womb veil, and that "the least intelligent" such as "the rough workman or dull peasant" would be most likely not to exercise self-control, one medical writer advocated [[intrauterine device]]s that could be left in place "if we wish to breed up not down."<ref>Robert L. Dickinson, "Simple Sterilization of Women by Cautery Stricture at the Intra-Uterine Tubal Openings, Compared with Other Methods," ''Surgery, Gynecology, and Obstetrics'' 23 (1916), p. 204 [http://books.google.com/books?id=6N9BAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA204&dq=%22womb+veil%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=19#v=onepage&q=%22womb%20veil%22&f=false  online.]</ref> 

Anxieties about "race suicide"<ref>Cadwallader, ''Hand-book of Obstetrics'', p. 260 [http://books.google.com/books?id=45kuOD65zg0C&pg=PA260&dq=%22race+suicide%22+inauthor:cadwallader&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22race%20suicide%22%20inauthor%3Acadwallader&f=false online.]</ref> also framed opposition to birth control. The average number of births among white married couples is estimated to have dropped by nearly half between 1800 and 1900.<ref>Katz, "The History of Birth Control in the United States," p. 82.</ref> Womb veils were pointed to in racially charged rhetoric warning that contraception threatened the white, specifically [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Anglo-Saxon]], [[fertility rate]]. A Missouri physician blamed [[gynecology]] as a medical specialty for teaching "young ladies how to avoid conception," claiming that "syringes, sponges,<ref>Inserted sponges have been used as barrier contraception since antiquity, when they were often saturated with a fluid, commonly vinegar, aimed at creating an environment less hospitable for fertilization. The sponge was one of the first methods of contraception recommended in printed informational tracts, appearing as early as 1797. See Brodie, ''Contraception and Abortion'', p. 212.</ref> and womb-veils will exterminate the [[List of passengers on the Mayflower|descendants of the Mayflower]]."<ref>"Dr. George W.

<blockquote>
we should have no criminal abortion cases, no womb veils, no tubes with buttons to close the os,<ref>This phrase may be engimatic to the 21st-century reader; the ''os'' refers to the opening of the uterus, and tubes were part of the syringe apparatus that was standard for an obstetric [[medical bag]]; see Robert Banres, ''Lectures on Obstetric Operations'' (London, 1871), p. 6 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Bm0oAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA6&dq=%22obstetric+instruments+—+The+obstetric+Bag%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=1&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22obstetric%20instruments%20—%20The%20obstetric%20Bag%22&f=false online.] The closing of the ''os'' here, however, seems to mean a measure taken to prevent conception; a procedure that sounds similar is described as an alternative to [[hysterectomy]] in ''The American Journal of the Medical Sciences'' (August 1897), pp. 257–258 [http://books.google.com/books?id=PgkCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA258&dq=tubes+with+buttons+to+close+the+os&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=27#v=onepage&q=&f=false  online.]</ref> and the Anglo-Saxon race, instead of being in a decadent condition, would rise in its birth rate and not leave the race problem to the [[Latins|Latin]]-[[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] and [[colored]] race.<ref>J.P.

In fact, indications are that black Americans also practiced family planning to a comparable degree in the post-slavery period, and several factors seem to have influenced a desire for smaller families among various demographic groups in the 19th century.<ref>Katz, "The History of Birth Control in the United States," p. 86 ''et passim''.</ref>
