'''Favus''' (Latin for "honeycomb") is a [[disease]] usually affecting the [[scalp]],<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000039109|favus}}</ref> but occurring occasionally on any part of the skin, and even at times on [[mucous membrane]]s. 

==Presentation==
The uncomplicated appearance is that of a number of yellowish, circular, cup-shaped crusts ([[scutula]]) grouped in patches like a piece of honeycomb, each about the size of a split pea, with a hair projecting in the center. These increase in size and become crusted over, so that the characteristic [[lesion]] can only be seen round the edge of the [[Wound healing#Proliferative phase|scab]]. A mousy odour is often present.  Growth continues to take place for several months, when scab and [[scutulum]] come away, leaving a shining bare patch destitute of hair. The disease is essentially chronic, lasting from ten to twenty years. It is caused by the growth of a [[fungus]], and pathologically is the reaction of the tissues to the growth. 

The fungus was named after a microscopic structure termed "achorion" (a term not used in modern science), seen in scrapings of infected skin, which consists of slender, [[mycelia]]l threads matted together, bearing oval, nucleated fungal substrate-[[arthroconidia]] either free or jointed. This structure is currently called "scutula." The fungus itself is now called ''[[Trichophyton]] schoenleinii''.

During initial infection, the fungal spores would appear to enter through the unbroken cutaneous surface, and to germinate mostly in and around the [[hair follicle]] and sometimes in the shaft of the hair. 

==Species==
It was the first disease in which a fungus was discovered by [[Johann Lukas Schönlein|J. L. Schönlein]] in 1839; the discovery was published in a brief note of twenty lines in Millers Archive for that year (p. 82), the fungus having been subsequently named by [[Robert Remak]]; ''[[Achorion]] schoenleinii'' after its discoverer. 

In 1892, two additional "species" of the fungus were described by [[Paul Gerson Unna]], the ''Favus griseus'', giving rise to greyish-yellow scutula, and the ''Favus sulphureus celerior'', causing sulfur-yellow scutula of a rapid growth.  This was in the days before scientists learned to rigorously distinguish microorganism identities from disease identities, and these antique, ambiguous disease-based names no longer have status either in [[mycology]] or in [[dermatology]].

Similar looking infections, sometimes diagnosed as favus but more often as atypical inflammatory tinea, may rarely be produced by agents of more common dermatophyte fungal infections, in particular ''[[Microsporum gypseum]]'', the most common soil-borne dermatophyte fungus, and ''[[Trichophyton mentagrophytes]]'' (name used in post-1999 sense for a [[phylogenetic]] [[species]] formerly referred to as ''Trichophyton mentagrophytes'' var. ''quinckeanum''), the agent of favus infection of the mouse.    

==Treatment==
Up until the advent of modern therapies, favus was widespread worldwide; prior to Schönlein's recognition of it as a fungal disease, it was frequently confused with [[Hansen's disease]], better known as [[leprosy]], and European sufferers were sometimes committed to leprosaria.   Today, due to this species' high susceptibility to the antifungal drug [[griseofulvin]], it has been eliminated from most parts of the world except rural central Asia and scattered rural areas of Africa.  It is mainly a disease connected to demographic poverty and isolation, but is so readily treatable that it is among the diseases most likely to be completely eliminated by modern medicine.
