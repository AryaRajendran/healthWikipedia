A '''hypertensive emergency''' (formerly called '''"malignant hypertension"''') is severe [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) with acute impairment of one or more [[organ system]]s (especially the [[central nervous system]], [[cardiovascular system]] and/or the [[renal system]])<ref name=CFP11>{{cite journal|pmid=21998228 | volume=57 | issue=10 | title=Managing hypertensive emergencies in the ED | pmc=3192077 | year=2011 | month=October | author=Thomas L | journal=Can Fam Physician | pages=1137–97}}</ref> that can result in [[irreversible]] organ damage. In a hypertensive emergency, the [[blood pressure]] should be substantially lowered over a period of minutes to hours with an [[antihypertensive]] agent.

==Signs and symptoms==
The eyes may show [[retinal hemorrhage]] or an [[exudate]]. [[Papilledema]] must be present before a diagnosis of malignant hypertension can be made.

The [[brain]] shows manifestations of increased [[intracranial pressure]], such as headache, [[vomiting]], and/or [[subarachnoid hemorrhage|subarachnoid]] or [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

Patients will usually suffer from left ventricular dysfunction.

The kidneys will be affected, resulting in [[hematuria]], [[proteinuria]], and [[acute renal failure]].

It differs from other complications of hypertension in that it is accompanied by [[papilledema]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000051312|malignant hypertension}}</ref> This can be associated with [[hypertensive retinopathy]].

Other signs and symptoms can include:

*[[Chest pain]]
*[[Cardiac dysrhythmia|Arrhythmia]]s
*[[Headache]]
*[[Nosebleed|Epistaxis]]
*[[Dyspnea]]
*[[Syncope (medicine)|Faintness]] or [[vertigo]]
*Severe [[anxiety]]
*Agitation
*Altered mental status
*[[Paresthesia]]s
*Vomiting

Chest pain requires immediate lowering of blood pressure (such as with [[sodium nitroprusside]] infusions), while urgencies can be treated with oral agents, with the goal of lowering the [[mean arterial pressure]] (MAP) by 20% in 1–2 days with further reduction to "normal" levels in weeks or months. The former use of oral [[nifedipine]], a [[calcium channel blocker]], has been strongly discouraged because it is not absorbed in a controlled and reproducible fashion and has led to serious and fatal hypotensive problems.

Sometimes, the term hypertensive emergency is also used as a generic term, comprising both hypertensive ''emergency'', as a specific term for a serious and urgent condition of elevated blood pressure, and hypertensive ''urgency'', as a specific term of a less serious and less urgent condition (the terminology hypertensive ''crisis'' is usually used in this sense).

The term hypertensive emergency is primarily used as a specific term for a hypertensive crisis with a diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 120 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180mmHg. Hypertensive emergency differs from hypertensive crisis in that, in the former, there is evidence of acute organ damage.

==Pathophysiology==

The pathophysiology of hypertensive emergency is not well understood.<ref name="A">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/758544-overview |title=Hypertensive Emergencies |date=|accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> Failure of normal autoregulation and an abrupt rise in systemic vascular resistance are typical initial components of the disease process.<ref name="M">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/758544-overview |title=Pathophysiology |date=|accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> 

Hypertensive emergency pathophysiology includes:

* Abrupt increase in [[systemic vascular resistance]], likely related to humoral [[vasoconstrictors]]
* [[Endothelial]] injury
* [[Fibrinoid necrosis]] of the [[arterioles]]
* Deposition of [[platelets]] and [[fibrin]]
* Breakdown of normal autoregulatory function

The resulting [[ischemia]] prompts further release of vasoactive substances, completing a [[vicious cycle]].<ref name="C">{{cite web|url=http://www.4um.com/tutorial/anaesth/highbp.htm |title=Hypertension and Anaesthesia |date=|accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref>
If the process is not stopped, a vicious cycle of [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] failure begins, leading to loss of [[cerebrum|cerebral]] and local autoregulation, organ system ischemia and dysfunction, and [[myocardial infarction]].<ref name="D">{{cite web|url=http://www.vbwg.org/resources/Slide_Lecture.../2/VBWG08_AH2.ppt |title=Vascular Biology Working Group |date=|accessdate=2010-04-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

It is estimated that single-organ involvement is found in approximately 83% of hypertensive emergency patients, two-organ involvement in about 14% of patients, and [[multi-organ failure]] (failure of at least 3 organ systems) in about 3% of patients. 

The most common clinical presentations of hypertensive emergencies are [[cerebral infarction]] (24.5%), [[pulmonary edema]] (22.5%), [[hypertensive encephalopathy]] (16.3%), and [[congestive heart failure]] (12%). Less common presentations include [[intracranial hemorrhage]], [[aortic dissection]], and [[eclampsia]].<ref name="M">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/758544-overview |title= Hypertensive emergency|date=|accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> 

Cerebral autoregulation is the ability of the [[blood vessels]] in the brain to maintain a constant [[blood flow]]. It has been shown that people who suffer from chronic hypertension can tolerate higher arterial pressure before their autoregulation system is disrupted. Hypertensives also have an increased cerebrovascular resistance which puts them at greater risk of developing cerebral ischemia if the blood flow decreases into a normotensive range. On the other hand, sudden or rapid rises in blood pressure may cause hyperperfusion and increased cerebral blood flow, causing increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema. [[Hypertensive encephalopathy]] - characterized by hypertension, altered mentation, and [[papilledema]]- is one of the clinical manifestations of cerebral edema and microhemorrhages seen with dysfunction of cerebral autoregulation.<ref name="M">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/758544-overview | title=Central nervous system |date=|accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> 

Increased [[arterial stiffness]], increased [[systolic blood pressure]], and widened pulse pressures, all resulting from chronic hypertension, can lead to heart damage. Coronary perfusion pressures are decreased by these factors, which also increase myocardial oxygen consumption, possibly leading to left [[ventricular hypertrophy]]. As the left ventricle becomes unable to compensate for an acute rise in systemic vascular resistance, left ventricular failure and [[pulmonary edema]] or myocardial ischemia may occur.

Chronic hypertension has a great impact on the renal vasculature, leading to pathologic changes in the small arteries of the [[kidney]]. Affected arteries develop endothelial dysfunction and impairment of normal [[vasodilation]], which alter renal autoregulation. When the renal autoregulatory system is disrupted, the [[glomerulus|intraglomerular]] pressure starts to vary directly with the systemic arterial pressure, thus offering no protection to the kidney during blood pressure fluctuations. During a hypertensive crisis, this can lead to acute renal ischemia.

Endothelial injury can occur as a consequence of severe elevations in blood pressure, with [[fibrinoid necrosis]] of the [[arterioles]] following. The vascular injury leads to deposition of [[platelets]] and [[fibrin]], and a breakdown of the normal autoregulatory function. [[Ischemia]] occurs as a result, prompting further release of vasoactive substances. This process completes the vicious cycle.<ref name="N"/>

Many factors and causes are contributory in hypertensive crises. One main cause is the [[discontinuation]] of antihypertensive medications. Other common causes of hypertensive crises are autonomic hyperactivity, collagen-vascular diseases, drug use (particularly stimulants, especially [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]] and their [[Structural analog|substituted analogues]]), [[glomerulonephritis]], head trauma, [[neoplasia]]s, [[preeclampsia]] and [[eclampsia]], and renovascular hypertension.<ref name="N"/>   

During a hypertensive emergency uncontrolled blood pressure leads to progressive or impending end-organ dysfunction. Therefore, it is important to lower the blood pressure aggressively. Acute end-organ damage may occur, affecting the neurological, cardiovascular, renal, or other organ systems. Some examples of neurological damage include [[hypertensive encephalopathy]], [[cerebral vascular accident]]/[[cerebral infarction]], subarachnoid hemorrhage, and [[intracranial hemorrhage]]. Cardiovascular system damage can include [[myocardial ischemia]]/infarction, acute left ventricular dysfunction, acute pulmonary edema, and aortic dissection. Other end-organ damage can include acute [[renal failure]] or insufficiency,  [[retinopathy]], [[eclampsia]], and [[microangiopathic hemolytic anemia]].<ref name="O">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/h/hypertension/book-diseases-20a.htm |title=Hypertension -pathophysiology|date=|accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref>

Extreme blood pressure can lead to problems in the eye, such as retinopathy or damage to the blood vessels in the eye.<ref name="P">{{cite web|url=http://www.severe-hypertension.com/blurredvision.html |title=Blurred Vision Causes|date=|accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref>

==Treatment==

Several classes of antihypertensive agents are recommended, with the choice depending on the [[etiology]] of the hypertensive crisis, the severity of the elevation in blood pressure, and the usual blood pressure of the patient before the hypertensive crisis. In most cases, the administration of an [[intravenous]] [[sodium nitroprusside]] [[Injection (medicine)|injection]], which has an almost immediate [[antihypertensive]] effect, is suitable (but in many cases not readily available). In less urgent cases, oral agents like [[captopril]], [[clonidine]], [[labetalol]], or [[prazosin]] can be used, but all have a delayed onset of action (by several minutes) compared to sodium nitroprusside.

It is also important that the blood pressure be lowered smoothly, not too abruptly. The initial goal in hypertensive emergencies is to reduce the pressure by no more than 25% (within minutes to 1 or 2 hours), and then toward a level of 160/100&nbsp;mm Hg within a total of 2–6 hours. Excessive reduction in blood pressure can precipitate coronary, cerebral, or renal [[ischemia]] and, possibly, infarction.<ref name=AMN>{{cite web | Brewster LM, MD; Michael Sutters, MD | title =Hypertensive Urgencies & Emergencies - Hypertension Drug Therapy | work =Systemic Hypertension | url=http://www.health.am/hypertension/hypertensive-urgencies-emergencies/ | year = 2006 | publisher=Armenian Health Network, Health.am | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref>

The diagnosis of a hypertensive emergency is not based solely on an absolute level of blood pressure, but also on the typical blood pressure level of the patient before the hypertensive crisis occurs. Individuals with a history of [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] hypertension may not tolerate a "normal" blood pressure.

== Epidemiology ==
Although an estimated 50 million or more adult Americans suffer from hypertension, the relative incidence of hypertensive crisis is relatively low (less than 1% annually). Nevertheless, this condition does affect upward of 500,000 Americans each year, and is therefore a not insignificant cause of serious morbidity in the US.<ref name=Cleveland>{{cite web | Vidt DG | title =Emergency room management of hypertensive urgencies and emergencies | work = | url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/407727 | year = 2001 | publisher=Cleveland Clinic Foundation | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref>

According to a research published in 2006, hypertension prevalence is again on the rise, with 28.6% of the U.S. population estimated to be suffering from it in the period 1999-2002. According to the study, relative incidence rates of hypertension range between 3% and 18% of the population. These numbers depend on the age, [[gender]], [[ethnicity]], and body size.<ref name="K">{{cite web|url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102132?cookieSet=1&journalCode=publhealth |title=Hypertension: Trends in Prevalence, Incidence, and Control |date=|accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref>

According to Whelton, the incidence and prevalence of hypertension is about 50% higher in [[African-American]] adults than in white or Mexican-American populations. Also, Whelton adds that prevalence of hypertension has increased progressively in [[children]] and [[adolescents]] between 1988-2000.  According to this study, recent estimates indicate that approximately 1 billion [[adults]] worldwide have hypertension, with the highest prevalence of hypertension in [[Eastern Europe]] and the Latin American/Caribbean region.<ref name="L">{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/494336_2 |title=Prevalence and Incidence of Hypertension |date=|accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref>

As a result of the use of [[antihypertensives]], the incidence of hypertensive emergencies has declined from 7% to 1% of patients with hypertension. The 1–year survival rate has also increased. Before 1950, this survival rate was only 20%, but it is now more than 90% with proper medical treatment.<ref name="M">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/758544-overview |title=Hypertensive Emergencies |date=|accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref> 

Hypertensive crises more commonly occur among African-Americans and the [[elderly]]. Most patients who experience hypertensive crises have previously been diagnosed as hypertensive and been prescribed antihypertensive therapy, but continue to have inadequate blood pressure control.<ref name="N">{{cite web|url=http://www.uam.es/departamentos/medicina/anesnet/journals/ija/vol1n1/articles/htncrise.htm |title=Hypertensive Crises: Recognition and Management |date=|accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref> 

Estimates indicate that approximately 1% to 2% of patients with hypertension develop hypertensive crisis at some point in their lifetime. [[Men]] are more commonly affected by hypertensive crises than [[women]]. 

The incidence of hypertensive crises has increased and hospital admissions tripled between 1983 and 1990, from 23,000 to 73,000 per year in the United States. The incidence of postoperative hypertensive crisis varies and such variation depends on the population examined. Most studies report and incidence of between 4% to 35%.<ref name="O">{{cite web|url=http://www.turner-white.com/pdf/brm_CC_pre7_2.pdf |title=Hypertensive Crises |date=|accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Severe hypertension is a serious and potentially life-threatening medical condition with a generally poor prognosis. It is estimated that people who do not receive appropriate treatment only live an average of about three years after the diagnosis has been established.<ref name="G">{{cite web|url=http://www.severehypertension.org/ | title=Severe Hypertension Symptoms
|date=|accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> 

The [[Morbidity#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] of hypertensive emergencies depend on the extent of end-organ dysfunction at the time of presentation and the degree to which blood pressure is controlled afterward. With good blood pressure control and medication compliance, the 10-year survival rate of patients with hypertensive crises approaches 70%.<ref name="H">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/758544-overview |title=Mortality/Morbidity
|date=|accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> 

The risks of developing a life-threatening disease affecting the heart or brain increase as the blood flow increases. Commonly, ischemic heart attack and stroke are the causes that lead to death in patients with severe hypertension. It is estimated that for every 20&nbsp;mm Hg systolic or 10&nbsp;mm Hg diastolic increase in blood pressures above 115/75&nbsp;mm Hg, the mortality rate for both ischemic heart disease and stroke doubles.

Several studies have concluded that [[African Americans]] have a greater incidence of hypertension and a greater morbidity and mortality from hypertensive disease than [[non-Hispanic whites]].<ref name=J>{{cite journal | Howard, J. | title =Race Differences in Hypertension Mortality Trends: Differential Drug Exposure as a Theory | work =Systemic Hypertension | jstor=3349030 | year = 1965 | publisher=Milbank Mem Fund Q | 43:202-218 }}</ref> It appears that hypertensive crisis is also more common in African Americans compared with other races.

Although severe hypertension is more common in the [[elderly]], it may occur in children (though very rarely). Also, women have slightly increased risks of developing hypertension crises than do men.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The lifetime risk for developing hypertension is 86-90% in females and 81-83% in males.
