The '''pathophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome''' is unknown. Several potential [[etiology|causes]] for the [[pathogenesis|development]] of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] have been proposed, including [[nervous system|neurological]] factors, psychological or psychosocial factors or influences, infections, [[immune system|immunological]] factors, [[Endocrine system|endocrinal]] factors and genetic factors. Other, less-common theories have also been articulated. No clinically meaningful risk factor has been identified.<ref name="PMID_17892624">{{cite journal | author = Hempel S, Chambers D, Bagnall AM, Forbes C | title = Risk factors for chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis: a systematic scoping review of multiple predictor studies | journal = Psychol Med | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 915–26 | year = 2008 | month = July | pmid = 17892624 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291707001602}}</ref>

[[Dysautonomia]] is the disruption of the function of the [[autonomic nervous system]] (ANS) which controls many aspects of [[homeostasis]].

===Psychoneuroimmunological interactions===
The [[psychoneuroimmunology|brain and immune system]] influence each other, especially in the [[HPA axis]] and [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Mental stress causes suppression of the immune system by [[hormones]] such as [[cortisol]] and [[epinepherine]]. Release of stress hormones, caused by diseases outside the brain, can result in neurological symptoms due to the influence of stress hormones on neurotransmitters. Neuropsychiatric disorders present in CFS may be related to [[autoantibodies]] to neuronal or endothelial (interior surface of blood vessels) targets,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Margutti P, Delunardo F, Ortona E | title = Autoantibodies associated with psychiatric disorders | journal = Curr Neurovasc Res | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages =149–57 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16719797 | doi = 10.2174/156720206776875894}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Tanaka S, Kuratsune H, Hidaka Y, Hakariya Y, Tatsumi KI, Takano T, Kanakura Y, Amino N | title = Autoantibodies against muscarinic cholinergic receptor in chronic fatigue syndrome | journal = Int J Mol Med | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–30 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12851722}}</ref> or disordered cytokine production by [[glial cells]] within the central nervous system.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vollmer-Conna U, Lloyd A, Hickie I, Wakefield D | title = Chronic fatigue syndrome: an immunological perspective | journal = Aust N Z J Psychiatry | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 523–7 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9711366 | doi = 10.3109/00048679809068326}}</ref>

==Psychological and psychosocial==
The possible involvement of psychological factors within CFS is both unclear and contentious,<ref name="CDCBasic">{{cite web | title = Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Basic Facts | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = May 9, 2006 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/cfs/cfsbasicfacts.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Using Documents in Social Research|last=Prior|first=Lindsay|year=2003|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-5747-8|page=120|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cmobV4fXRtgC&pg=PA120&lpg=PA120&dq=cfs+psychological+contentious&q=cfs%20psychological%20contentious|accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref> with several psychological and psychosocial factors having been theorized.

===Behavioral===
High levels of "action-proneness" may play a predisposing, initiating and/or perpetuating role in CFS.<ref name="pmid11595245">{{cite journal |author=Van Houdenhove B, Neerinckx E, Onghena P, Lysens R, Vertommen H |title=Premorbid "overactive" lifestyle in chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia.

[[Neuroticism]] and [[Extraversion and introversion|introversion]] have previously been reported as risk factors for developing CFS.<ref name=Prins2006>{{cite journal |author=Prins JB, van der Meer JW, Bleijenberg G |title=Chronic fatigue syndrome |journal=Lancet |volume=367|issue=9507 |pages=346–55 |year=2006 |pmid=16443043 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68073-2}}</ref> A recent [[systematic review]] of personality and CFS found an association with neuroticism, but stated that it was often accounted for by co-morbid depression and levels were similar to those in patients with other chronic diseases, and found no firm evidence for introversion.<ref>{{cite journal | author = van Geelen SM, Sinnema G, Hermans HJ, Kuis W | title = Personality and chronic fatigue syndrome: Methodological and conceptual issues | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | year = 2007 | month = January | pmid = 17350740 | url = http://www.umcutrecht.nl/NR/rdonlyres/9751DFE7-3822-44AC-8546-6633DF940AA8/6338/Artikel6_vanGeelen_PersonailtyandCFSmethodological.pdf | doi= 10.1016/j.cpr.2007.01.010 | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 885–903}}</ref>

===Cognitive behavioural model===
According to the cognitive-behavioural model of illness, the patient's interpretation of symptoms plays an important role in perpetuating the illness. Catastrophic interpretations of symptoms, the belief that symptoms are beyond the patient's control and excessive emotional reactions may accentuate the physiological changes giving rise to symptoms. The cognitive-behavioural model differs from the extreme psychological model which proposes that illness symptoms are exclusively mental.<ref>{{cite book |author=Mark A. Demitrack, Susan E. Abbey |title=Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: An Integrative Approach to Evaluation and Treatment |publisher=Guilford Press|year=1999 |pages=241 |isbn=1-57230-499-5, 9781572304994 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> In response to a version of the cognitive behavioural model described in the book "Chronic Fatigue and Its Syndromes", the authors of a status report on CFS state, "Although this model may explain continued illness in some CFS patients, it certainly does not pertain to all CFS patients and is thus not too satisfactory."<ref name="pmid12194905"/>

===Fixation===
Some research suggests that CFS may be perpetuated when patients fixate on a physical cause for their symptoms or when exercise is avoided.<ref name="Prins2006"/><ref name="Deary">{{cite journal |author=Deary V, Chalder T, Sharpe M |title=The cognitive behavioural model of medically unexplained symptoms: a theoretical and empirical review |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=781–97 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17822818 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.07.002 |url=}}</ref>

===Illness behavior===
A lack of support, or the reinforcement of [[Sickness behavior|illness behavior]] by social networks, may be associated with delayed recovery for some patients.<ref name="Prins2006"/>

===Mood disorders===
There are clinical overlaps and differences between CFS and [[clinical depression]]. Current mood disorders occur in 18.9% of CFS patients compared to 3.9% of the general population.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Prins J, Bleijenberg G, Rouweler EK, van der Meer J. | title = Effect of psychiatric disorders on outcome of cognitive-behavioural therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 187 | pages = 184–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16055833 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.187.2.184 | issue = 2 }}</ref>  Previous psychiatric disorders or shared risk factors for psychiatric disorders may have an etiological role in some cases of CFS.<ref name="pmid17976252">{{cite journal |author=Harvey SB, Wadsworth M, Wessely S, Hotopf M |title=The relationship between prior psychiatric disorder and chronic fatigue: evidence from a national birth cohort study |journal=Psychol Med |volume= 38|issue= 7|pages=1–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17976252 |doi=10.1017/S0033291707001900}}</ref> The presence of multiple comorbid disorders could be a marker for psychological influences on etiology.<ref name="pmid11910364">{{cite journal |author=Whitehead WE, Palsson O, Jones KR |title=Systematic review of the comorbidity of irritable bowel syndrome with other disorders: what are the causes and implications? |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=122 |issue=4 |pages=1140–56 |year=2002 |pmid=11910364 |doi=10.1053/gast.2002.32392}}</ref> Neuropsychological impairments could be involved in CFS,<ref name="pmid7778111">{{cite journal |author=Deluca J, Johnson SK, Natelson BH |title=Neuropsychiatric status of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome: an overview |journal=Toxicol Ind Health |volume=10 |issue=4–5 |pages=513–22 |year=1994 |pmid=7778111 |doi=}}</ref> and neuroendocrine studies and brain imaging have confirmed the occurrence of neurobiological abnormalities in most patients with CFS.<ref name="pmid8870062">{{cite journal |author=Gonzalez MB, Cousins JC, Doraiswamy PM |title=Neurobiology of chronic fatigue syndrome |journal=Prog.

===Sensitization===
Central sensitization could be responsible for the sustaining pain complaints in CFS. Elevated concentrations of nitric oxide are present in the blood of CFS patients, and brain imaging shows brain abnormalities. Catastrophizing, avoidance behaviour, and somatization may result in, or are initiated by, sensitization of the central nervous system.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nijs J, Van de Velde B, De Meirleir K |title=Pain in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome: does nitric oxide trigger central sensitization? |journal=Med.

==Infections==
Many viral and bacterial infections have been proposed to cause or associate with CFS, but no infectious influence on pathophysiology has been proven.

==Endocrine system==
The [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) controls levels of [[hormone]]s such as [[cortisol]] and is activated in a [[circadian rhythm]] and modulated by factors such as [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], [[digestion]] or [[illness]]. It is important in regulating energy metabolism, the immune system, stress responses and inflammation in the body.

The main endocrinological research findings in CFS are mild hypocortisolism, a blunted [[adrenocorticotropin]] (ACTH) response to stressors, and enhanced negative feedback sensitivity to glucocorticoids; however there is no specific or uniform dysfunction of the HPA axis in CFS and about half of relevant studies did not find evidence of either hypocortisolism or an abnormal response to various types of challenge tests. It has been debated whether these disturbances would play a primary role in the pathogenesis of CFS, but prospective evidence suggests that the HPA axis is not an important factor during the early stages of CFS, although it has been hypothesized that it might play a role in exacerbating or perpetuating symptoms later on in the course of the illness.<ref name="PMID 12700181">{{cite journal | author = Cleare AJ | title = The neuroendocrinology of chronic fatigue syndrome. | journal = Endocr Rev | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 236–52 | year = 2003 | month = April | pmid = 12700181 | url = http://edrv.endojournals.org/content/24/2/236.long}}</ref><ref name="PMID 15036250">{{cite journal | author = Cleare AJ | title = The HPA axis and the genesis of chronic fatigue syndrome. | journal = Trends Endocrinol Metab | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 55–9 | year = X | month = March | pmid = 15036250 | url = | doi=10.1016/j.tem.2003.12.002}}</ref><ref name="PMID 17596739">{{cite journal | author = Van Den Eede F, Moorkens G, Van Houdenhove B, Cosyns P, Claes SJ | title = Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in chronic fatigue syndrome. | journal = Neuropsychobiology | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 112–20 | year = 2007 | month = | pmid = 17596739 | url = http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ArtikelNr=000104468&Ausgabe=233279&ProduktNr=224082&filename=000104468.pdf | doi=10.1159/000104468}}</ref> A 2011 meta-analysis reported a [[effect size|small]] but [[statistically significant]] hypocortisolism in CFS.<ref name="PMID 21315796">{{cite journal | author = Tak LM, Cleare AJ, Ormel J, Manoharan A, Kok IC, Wessely S, Rosmalen JG | title = Meta-analysis and meta-regression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in functional somatic disorders. | journal = Biol Psychol | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–94 | year = 2011 | month = May | pmid = 21315796 | url = | doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.02.002}}</ref> A study of cognitive behavioural therapy for CFS, which also measured cortisol levels, had observed that hypocortisolism was associated with a poorer response to CBT.<ref name="PMID 19607750">{{cite journal | author = Roberts AD, Charler ML, Papadopoulos A, Wessely S, Chalder T, Cleare AJ | title = Does hypocortisolism predict a poor response to cognitive behavioural therapy in chronic fatigue syndrome? | journal = Psychol Med | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 515–22 | year = 2010 | month = March | pmid = 19607750 | url = | doi=10.1017/S0033291709990390}}</ref>

===Essential fatty acid deficiencies===
Essential fatty acid levels: Several studies published between 1990 and 2005 reported finding reduced levels of Omega-6 or Omega-3 [[essential fatty acids]] in [[cell membranes]] or [[Blood serum|serum]] in patients diagnosed with post-viral fatigue syndrome or CDC-defined CFS.<ref name="pmid2270749">{{cite journal |author=Behan PO, Behan WM, Horrobin D |title=Effect of high doses of essential fatty acids on the postviral fatigue syndrome |journal=Acta Neurol.

===Toxic agents===
[[Insecticide]]s have a possible effect on the cause and/or course of CFS.<ref name="pmid16978917"/> Chronic exposure to [[organophosphate]]s, a pesticide, has neurophsychiatric effects including cognitive impairment and chronic fatigue,<ref name="Tahmaz">{{cite journal |author=Tahmaz N, Soutar A, Cherrie JW |title=Chronic fatigue and organophosphate pesticides in sheep farming: a retrospective study amongst people reporting to a UK pharmacovigilance scheme |journal=Ann Occup Hyg |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=261–7 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12765866 |doi= 10.1093/annhyg/meg042|url=}}</ref> and according to a paper by Davies, the CDC includes organophosphates as a cause of (CFS).

===Exercise findings===
In a large national birth cohort study, the risk of developing CFS as an adult was inversely correlated with childhood exercise, but no association was found for other childhood or maternal factors such as psychological problems, academic ability, allergic tendencies, birth weight, birth order or obesity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Viner R, Hotopf M | title = Childhood predictors of self reported chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis in adults: national birth cohort study | journal = BMJ | volume = 329 | issue = 7472 | pages = 941 | year = 2003 | pmid = 15469945 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38258.507928.55 | pmc = 524102}}</ref> However, a similar study found that an increased level of exercise in childhood and early-adulthood is a risk factor.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Harvey SB, Wadsworth M, Wessely S, Hotopf M | title = Etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome: testing popular hypotheses using a national birth cohort study | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 70 | issue = 4 | pages = 488–95 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18378866 | doi = 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31816a8dbc}}</ref>
