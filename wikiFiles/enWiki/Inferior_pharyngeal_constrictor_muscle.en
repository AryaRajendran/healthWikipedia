The '''Inferior pharyngeal constrictor''', the thickest of the three constrictors, arises from the sides of the [[cricoid]] and [[thyroid cartilage]]. Similarly to the [[Superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle|superior]] and [[middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle|middle]] pharyngeal constrictor muscles, it is innervated by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X), specifically, by branches from the pharyngeal plexus and by neuronal branches from the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

==Origin and insertion==
The muscle is composed of two parts.  The first (and more superior) arising from the thyroid cartilage ('''thyropharyngeal part''') and the second arising from the cricoid cartilage ('''cricopharyngeal part'''). <ref>{{MuscleLoyola|icon}}</ref>

* On the ''thyroid cartilage'' it arises from the oblique line on the side of the [[wikt:lamina|lamina]], from the surface behind this nearly as far as the posterior border and from the inferior cornu. 

* From the ''cricoid cartilage'' it arises in the interval between the [[Cricothyreoideus]] in front, and the articular facet for the [[inferior horn of thyroid cartilage|inferior cornu]] of the thyroid cartilage behind. 

From these origins the fibers spread backward and medialward to be inserted with the muscle of the opposite side into the fibrous [[pharyngeal raphe]] in the posterior median line of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]].  

The inferior fibers are horizontal and continuous with the circular fibers of the [[esophagus]]; the rest ascend, increasing in obliquity, and overlap the [[Constrictor medius]].

== Action ==
As soon as the [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] of food is received in the pharynx, the elevator muscles relax, the pharynx descends, and the constrictors contract upon the bolus, and convey it downward into the esophagus.

== Role in human disease ==
Uncoordinated contraction, and/or [[Cricopharyngeal Spasm]] and/or impaired relaxation of this muscle are currently considered the main factors in development of a [[Zenker's diverticulum]].

Motor incoordination of the cricopharyngeus can cause difficulty [[swallowing]].

Between the two bellies of the inferior constrictor (Thyropharyngeal and Cricopharyngeal) is a small gape called '[[Killian's dehiscence]]'. It is clinically important as a diverticulum can form where a 'balloon' of mucosa becomes trapped outside the pharyngeal boundaries. Food or other materials may reside here, which may lead to infection.
