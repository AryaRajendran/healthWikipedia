A '''callus''' (or '''[[callosity]]''') is a toughened area of [[skin]] which has become relatively thick and hard in response to repeated friction, pressure, or other irritation. Rubbing that is too frequent or forceful will cause [[blister]]s rather than allow calluses to form. Since repeated contact is required, calluses are most often found on feet because of frequent walking.  Calluses are generally not harmful, but may sometimes lead to other problems, such as [[Ulcer (dermatology)|skin ulceration]] or [[infection]].

==Causes==
Normally, a callus will form on any part of the skin exposed to friction over a long period of time. For example, people often develop calluses on the [[middle finger]] of their [[dominant hand]] due to writing with a pen or pencil. Another cause is from playing string instruments like the guitar or the violin; calluses will develop on the four fingers of the hand used in holding the strings down to the fingerboard, and sometimes on the fingers of the hand used for [[pizzicato]] or [[strumming]]. Calluses are also very common on the fingers of [[bassists]] who use both the [[pizzicato]] and [[slapping]] techniques. This also applies to rock climbers on almost all of their fingers. There are many activities that can result in the formation of a callus, and having one is sometimes viewed as a badge of honor.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.google.com/search?q=proud+calluses | title=Google Search}}</ref> Activities that are notorious for causing calluses include (but are not limited to) [[list of construction trades|construction work]], many sports, wood carving, playing musical instruments, use of chef knifes, rock climbing, hiking, martial arts, [[weight training]], dancing (especially ballet), chopping wood, and wearing high heels. [[Tenpin bowling|Tenpin bowlers]] will often develop calluses on their thumbs and occasionally their middle fingers from frequent bowling.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tititudorancea.com/z/callus.htm | title=Google Search}}</ref> Although often found on the [[foot]] (where the most pressure and friction are applied), calluses can occur anywhere on the body as a reaction to moderate, constant "grinding" pressure. It is the natural reaction of the [[palmar]] or [[plantar]] skin. Too much friction occurring too fast for the skin to develop a protective callus will cause a [[blister]] or [[abrasion (medical)|abrasion]] instead.

Biologically, calluses are formed by the accumulation of [[cellular differentiation|terminally]] differentiated [[keratinocyte]]s in the outermost layer of skin. Though the cells of calluses are dead, they are quite resistant to mechanical and chemical insults due to extensive networks of cross-linked proteins and [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] keratin [[intermediate filaments]] containing many [[disulfide bonds]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tantisiriwat N, Janchai S |title=Transglutaminases: multifunctional cross-linking enzymes that stabilize tissues. |journal=The FASEB Journal |volume=5 |issue=15 |pages=3071–7 |year=1991 |month=Dec |pmid=1683845 |doi= |url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/5/15/3071.long}}</ref> 

Sometimes a callus occurs where there is no rubbing or pressure. These [[hyperkeratoses]] can have a variety of causes. Some toxins, such as [[arsenic]], can cause thick palms and soles. Some diseases, such as [[syphilis]], can cause thickening of the palms and soles as well as pinpoint hyperkeratoses. There is a benign condition called ''keratosis palmaris et plantaris'', which produces corns in the creases of the fingers and non-weight bearing spaces of the feet. Some of this may be caused by [[actinic keratosis]], which occurs due to overexposure to sun or with age and hormonal shifts.

==Corns==
{{Main|Corn (medicine)}}
A ''[[corn (medicine)|corn]]'' (or ''clavus'', plural ''clavi'') is a specially-shaped callus of dead skin that usually occurs on thin or [[glabrous]] (hairless and smooth) skin surfaces, especially on the dorsal surface of toes or fingers. They can sometimes occur on the thicker [[palmar]] or [[plantar]] skin surfaces. Corns form when the pressure point against the skin traces an elliptical or semi-elliptical path during the rubbing motion, the center of which is at the point of pressure, gradually widening. If there is constant stimulation of the tissue producing the corns, even after the corn is surgically removed, the skin may continue to grow as a corn.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}[[Image:Corns.jpg|thumb|Painful corns]]

The hard part at the center of the corn resembles a funnel with a broad raised top and a pointed bottom. Because of their shape, corns intensify the pressure at the tip and can cause deep tissue damage and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]].<ref name=Silverberg>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1089594-overview  eMedicine > Clavus] By Nanette Silverberg. Updated: Apr 9, 2010</ref> The scientific name for a corn is ''heloma'' (plural ''helomata''). A hard corn is called a ''heloma durum'', while a soft corn is called a ''heloma molle''.

The location of soft corns tends to differ from that of hard corns. Hard corns occur on dry, flat surfaces of skin. Soft corns (frequently found between adjacent toes) stay moist, keeping the surrounding skin soft. The corn's center is not soft however, but [[Induration|indurated]].

The specific diagnostic workup and treatments for corns may differ substantially from other forms of calluses.

==Prevention==
Corns and calluses are easier to prevent than to treat.  When it is not desirable to form a callus, minimizing rubbing and pressure will prevent callus formation.  Footwear should be properly fitted,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/finding-the-right-footwear-for-your-foot-problem | title = Foot problems: Finding the right shoes | first = Shannon | last = Erstad | date = 6 March 2008 | work = [[WebMD]] Medical Reference from Healthwise | publisher = Healthwise | at = "How do I find the right shoes?" | accessdate = 2010-06-10 | quote = You should not have to "break in" shoes if they fit properly.}}</ref> gloves may be worn, and protective pads, rings or skin dressings may be used.  People with poor circulation or sensation should check their skin often for signs of rubbing and irritation so they can minimize any damage.

==Treatment==
Calluses and corns may go away by themselves eventually, once the irritation is consistently avoided.  They may also be dissolved with [[keratolytic]] agents containing [[salicylic acid]], sanded down with a [[pumice]] stone or filed down with a callus shaver, or pared down by a professional such as a [[podiatrist]] or a [[foot health practitioner]].<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/corns-and-calluses/DS00033/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs Corns and calluses: Treatments and drugs].

Before 1937 (when commerce in medicinal [[cannabis]] was effectively banned by a [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937|federal law]] in the [[United States]]), topical corn remedies usually contained tincture of cannabis, which possessed effective antibacterial properties and the rich green colour expected of such treatments at the time.<ref>http://antiquecannabisbook.com/chap6/CornMed.htm</ref>

==Diabetes==
People with [[diabetes]] face special skin challenges. Because diabetes affects the [[capillaries]], the small blood vessels which feed the skin, thickening of the skin with callus increases the difficulty of supplying nutrients to the skin.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} Callus formation is seen in high numbers of patients with diabetes, and together with absent foot pulses and formation of [[hammer toe]],<ref name="pmid19432661">{{cite journal |author=Alavi A, Sanjari M, Haghdoost A, Sibbald RG |title=Common foot examination features of 247 Iranian patients with diabetes |journal=Int Wound J |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=117–22 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19432661 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-481X.2009.00583.x |url=}} -12% having callus formation</ref><ref name="pmid18839852">{{cite journal |author=Tantisiriwat N, Janchai S |title=Common foot problems in diabetic foot clinic |journal=J Med Assoc Thai |volume=91 |issue=7 |pages=1097–101 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18839852 |doi= |url=}} -56% having callus present</ref> this may be an early sign of individuals at an increased risk for foot ulcers.<ref name="pmid19432661"/> 

The stiffness of a callus or corn, coupled with the [[shear stress|shear]] and pressure that caused it, may tear the capillaries or adjoining tissue, causing bleeding within the callus or corn.  Often, bleeding within a callus is an early sign of diabetes, even before elevated blood sugars may be noticed. Although the bleeding can be small, sometimes small pools of blood or [[hematoma]] are formed. The blood itself is an irritant, a foreign body within the callus that makes the area burn or itch. If the pool of blood is exposed to the outside, [[infection]] may follow. Infection may also lead to [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]]. Luckily, this process can be prevented at several places,  Diabetic foot infections are the leading cause of diabetic limb [[amputation]].

==Other meanings==
In [[botany]], the term is also used to describe a condition of thickened surfaces of leaves or other plant parts.  A callus also can refer to an undifferentiated plant cell mass grown on a culture medium, which can be put into a [[bioreactor]] to produce genetically identical cells.
