'''Ketosis''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|ɨ|ˈ|t|oʊ|s|ɨ|s}}) is a state of elevated levels of [[ketone bodies]] in the body.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ketosis thefreedictionary.com/ketosis] citing:
*The American Heritage® Medical Dictionary Copyright © 2007
*Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. © 2009
*Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. © 2007</ref> It is almost always generalized throughout the body, with '''hyperketonemia''', that is, an elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood. Ketone bodies are formed by [[ketogenesis]] when liver [[glycogen]] stores are depleted. The ketone bodies [[acetoacetate]] and [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|β-hydroxybutyrate]] are used for energy.<ref>Harvey & Champe, biochemistry</ref>

==Metabolic pathways==
When [[glycogen]] stores are not available in the cells, fat ([[triacylglycerol]]) is cleaved to provide 3 [[fatty acid]] chains and 1 [[glycerol]] molecule in a process known as [[lipolysis]]. Most of the body is able to use fatty acids as an alternative source of energy in a process called [[beta-oxidation]]. One of the products of beta-oxidation is [[acetyl-CoA]], which can be further used in the [[citric acid cycle]]. During prolonged fasting or starvation, acetyl-CoA in the liver is used to produce [[ketone bodies]] instead, leading to a state of ketosis.

During starvation or a long physical training session, the body starts using fatty acids instead of glucose. The [[brain]] cannot use long-chain fatty acids for energy because they are completely [[albumin]]-bound and cannot cross the [[blood–brain barrier]].  Not all [[Fatty acid|medium-chain fatty acids]] are bound to albumin.  The unbound medium-chain fatty acids are soluble in the blood and can cross the blood–brain barrier.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/52/3/502.pdf |authors=Robert C Johnson, Susan K Young, Richard Cotter, Lawrence Lin, and W Bruce Rowe |title=Medium-chain-triglyceride lipid emulsion: metabolism and tissue distribution |journal=Am J Clin Nutr |year=1990 |volume=52 |pages=502–8 |issue=3}}</ref> The ketone bodies produced in the liver can also cross the blood–brain barrier.  In the brain, these ketone bodies are then incorporated into acetyl-CoA and used in the [[citric acid cycle]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The ketone body acetoacetate will slowly decarboxylate into [[acetone]], a volatile compound that is both metabolized as an energy source and lost in the [[breath]] and [[urine]].

== Ketoacidosis ==
{{main|Ketoacidosis}}
[[Ketone bodies]] are acidic, but [[acid-base homeostasis]] in the blood is normally maintained through [[Bicarbonate buffering system|bicarbonate buffering]], [[respiratory compensation]] to vary the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the bloodstream, hydrogen ion absorption by tissue proteins and bone, and [[renal compensation]] through increased excretion of [[dihydrogen phosphate]] and [[ammonium]] ions.<ref name="Marshall2008">{{cite book | last1 = Marshall | first1 = William J. | last2 = Bangert | first2 = Stephen K. | title = Clinical biochemistry: metabolic and clinical aspects | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | year = 2008 | pages = 67–80 | accessdate = 2010-11-25 | isbn = 978-0-443-10186-1}}</ref> Prolonged excess of ketone bodies can overwhelm normal compensatory mechanisms, leading to [[acidosis]] if blood pH falls below 7.35.

There are two major causes of ketoacidosis:
* Most commonly, ketoacidosis is [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA), resulting from increased fat metabolism due to a shortage of [[insulin]]. It is associated primarily with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type I diabetes]], and may result in a [[diabetic coma]] if left untreated.<ref name="Kitabchi2006">{{cite journal |author=Kitabchi AE, Umpierrez GE, Murphy MB, Kreisberg RA |title=Hyperglycemic crises in adult patients with diabetes: a consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association |journal=[[Diabetes Care]] |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=2739–48 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17130218 |doi=10.2337/dc06-9916 |url=}}</ref>

* [[Alcoholic ketoacidosis]] (AKA) presents infrequently, but can occur with acute alcohol intoxication, most often following a binge in [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]] with acute or chronic liver or pancreatic disorders. Alcoholic ketoacidosis occurs more frequently following [[methanol]] or [[ethylene glycol]] intoxication than following intoxication with uncontaminated [[ethanol]].<ref name="Kraut2008">{{cite journal |author=Kraut JA, Kurtz I |title=Toxic alcohol ingestions: clinical features, diagnosis, and management |journal=[[Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=208–25 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18045860 |doi=10.2215/CJN.03220807 |url=}}</ref>

A mild acidosis may result from prolonged fasting or when following a [[ketogenic diet]] or a [[very low calorie diet]].<ref name="Hartman2007">{{cite journal |author=Hartman AL, Vining EP |title=Clinical aspects of the ketogenic diet |journal=[[Epilepsia]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=31–42 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17241206 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.00914.x |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Delbridge E, Proietto J|title=State of the science: VLED (Very Low Energy Diet) for obesity|journal=Asia Pac J Clin Nutr|year=2006|volume=15|pages=49–54|pmid=16928661|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16928661}}</ref>

==Diet==
If the diet is changed from one that is high in [[carbohydrates]] to one that does not provide sufficient carbohydrate to replenish glycogen stores, the body goes through a set of stages to enter ketosis. During the initial stages of this process, blood glucose levels are maintained through [[gluconeogenesis]], and the adult [[brain]] does not burn ketones. However, the brain makes immediate use of ketones for lipid synthesis in the brain. After about 48 hours of this process, the brain starts burning ketones in order to more directly use the energy from the fat stores that are being depended upon, and to reserve the glucose only for its absolute needs, thus avoiding the depletion of the body's protein store in the muscles.<ref name="www.proteinpower.com.metabolism-and-ketosis">{{cite web | author=Eades, M. R. | title=Metabolism and Ketosis | date=2007-05-22 | url=http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/ketones-and-ketosis/metabolism-and-ketosis/ }}</ref>

Ketosis is deliberately induced by use of a [[ketogenic diet]] as a medical intervention in cases of intractable [[epilepsy]].<ref name="Hartman2007" /> Other uses of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s remain controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Foster GD |title=A randomized trial of a low-carbohydrate diet for obesity |journal=N.

==Diagnosis==
Whether ketosis is taking place can be checked by using special urine test strips such as ''[[Ketostix]]''. The strips have a small pad on the end which is dipped in a fresh specimen of urine. Within a matter of seconds, the strip changes color indicating the level of ketone bodies detected, which reflects the degree of [[ketonuria]], which, in turn, can be used to give a rough estimation of the level of hyperketonemia in the body (see table below). Alternatively, some products targeted to diabetics such as the Abbott Precision Xtra or the Nova Max can be used to take a blood sample and measure the ketone levels directly. Normal [[serum reference ranges]] for ketone bodies are 0.5–3.0&nbsp;mg/dL, equivalent to 0.05–0.29&nbsp;mmol/L.<ref name=polymertechnology/>

Also, when the body is in ketosis, one's breath may smell of acetone. This is due to the break down of of acetoacetic acid into acetone and carbon dioxide which is exhaled through the lungs. Some find the smell offensive. Acetone is the same chemical responsible for the smell of nail polish remover and some paint thinners.

==Controversy==
Some clinicians regard restricting a diet from all carbohydrates as unhealthy and dangerous.<ref>Karra, Cindy: ''[http://www.shapeup.org/about/arch_pr/122903.php Shape Up America! Reveals The Truth About Dieters]'', Shape Up America! (by former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop), 29 December 2003</ref>  However, it isn't necessary to completely eliminate all carbohydrates from the diet in order to achieve a state of ketosis.  Other clinicians regard ketosis as a safe biochemical process that occurs during the fat-burning state.<ref name=Volek>{{cite book|last=Volek|first=Jeff S.|title=The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living|year=2011|publisher=Beyond Obesity|isbn=978-0-9834907-0-8|pages=302|url=http://www.artandscienceoflowcarb.com|coauthors=Stephen D. Phinney}}</ref> 
Ketogenesis can occur solely from the byproduct of fat degradation: [[acetyl-CoA]]. Ketosis, which is accompanied by [[gluconeogenesis]] (the creation of glucose de novo from [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]]), is the specific state with which some clinicians are concerned. However, it is unlikely for a normal functioning person to reach life-threatening levels of ketosis, defined as serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (B-OHB) levels above 15 millimolar (mM) compared to ketogenic diets among non diabetics which "rarely run serum B-OHB levels above 3 mM."<ref>Volek and Phinney, p. 4</ref> This is avoided with proper basal secretion of pancreatic insulin. People who are unable to secrete basal insulin, such as type I diabetics and long-term type II diabetics, are liable to enter an unsafe level of ketosis, causing an eventual comatose state that requires emergency medical treatment.

The anti-ketosis conclusions have been challenged by a number of doctors and advocates of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s, who dispute assertions that the body has a preference for glucose and that there are dangers associated with ketosis.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM198501313120505|last=Eaton|first=S.

Conversely, it is speculated by [[Nick Lane]] <ref>{{cite book|last=Lane|first=Nick|pages=254–256|title=Power Sex Suicide Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life|year=2005|isbn=0-19-280481-2}}</ref> that the Inuit may have a genetic predisposition allowing them to eat a ketogenic diet and remain healthy.

==Veterinary medicine==
In [[dairy cattle]], ketosis is a common ailment that usually occurs during the first weeks after giving birth to a calf. Ketosis is in these cases sometimes referred to as ''acetonemia''. A study from 2011 revealed that whether ketosis is developed or not depends on the [[lipids]] a cow uses to create [[butterfat]]. Animals prone to ketosis mobilize fatty acids from [[adipose tissue]], while robust animals create fatty acids from blood [[phosphatidylcholine]] (lecithin). Healthy animals can be recognized by high levels of milk [[glycerophosphocholine]] and low levels of milk [[phosphocholine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klein MS, Buttchereit N, Miemczyk SP, ''et al.'' |title=NMR metabolomic analysis of dairy cows reveals milk glycerophosphocholine to phosphocholine ratio as prognostic biomarker for risk of ketosis |journal=J.
