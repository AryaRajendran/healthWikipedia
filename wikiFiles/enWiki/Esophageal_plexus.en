The '''esophageal plexus''' is formed by nerve fibers from two sources: 1.branches of the [[vagus nerve]] 2.visceral branches of the [[sympathetic trunk]].  The esophageal plexus and the [[cardiac plexus]] contain the same types of fibers and are both considered [[thoracic autonomic plexus]](es).

==Parasympathetic Fibers==
1.  The [[Vagus nerve]] delivers two fiber types to the esophageal plexus:

* A.  Preganglionic Parasympathetic fibers ([[Preganglionic fibers]]) - These fibers have their cell bodies located in the [[dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus]] and they will synapse on the [[terminal ganglia]] in the walls of the [[esophagus]].
* B.  [[Afferent fibers]]- These fibers are primarily concerned with autonomic reflexes and they have their cell bodies in the [[inferior ganglion of the vagus]].

"Note":  These vagal fibers in the esophageal plexus reform to make the [[anterior vagal trunk]] (left vagus) and the [[posterior vagal trunk]] (right vagus).  Anterior and posterior being terms in relation to the [[esophagus]]. a mnemonic for which is 'LARP': Left becomes Anterior, Right becomes Posterior.

==Sympathetic Fibers==
2.  The visceral branches of the [[sympathetic trunk]] also deliver two fiber types to the esophageal plexus
* A.  [[sympathetic postganglionic fibers]]-  The cell bodies of these fibers are located in the [[sympathetic trunk ganglia]].  The cell bodies of the [[preganglionic fibers]], the first neuron of this two neuron chain, are located in the [[intermediolateral cell column]] ([[IMLCC]]) of the [[thoracic spinal cord]].
* B.  [[Afferent fibers]]- These fibers are primarily concerned with pain and have cell bodies located in the [[dorsal root ganglion]].
