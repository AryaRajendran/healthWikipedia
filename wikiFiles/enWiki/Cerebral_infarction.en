A '''cerebral infarction''' is an [[ischemia|ischemic]] [[stroke]] resulting from a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain. It can be atherothrombotic or embolic.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Ropper, Allan H.; Adams, Raymond Delacy; Brown, Robert F.; Victor, Maurice | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Adams and Victor's principles of neurology | date=2005 | publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical Pub. Division | location=New York  | isbn=0-07-141620-X | pages=686–704}}</ref> Stroke caused by cerebral infarction should be distinguished from two other kinds of stroke: [[cerebral hemorrhage]] and  [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]].  A cerebral infarction occurs when a [[blood vessel]] that supplies a part of the [[brain]] becomes blocked or leakage occurs outside the vessel walls. This loss of blood supply results in the death of that area of tissue. Cerebral infarctions vary in their severity with one third of the cases resulting in death.

==Classification==
There are various classification systems for a cerebral infarction. 

* The Oxford Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the initial symptoms. Based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as [[total anterior circulation infarct]] (TACI), [[partial anterior circulation infarct]] (PACI), [[lacunar infarct]] (LACI) or [[posterior circulation infarct]] (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bamford J, Sandercock P, Dennis M, Burn J, Warlow C |title=Classification and natural history of clinically identifiable subtypes of cerebral infarction |journal=Lancet |volume=337 |issue=8756 |pages=1521–6 |year=1991 |month=June |pmid=1675378 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0140-6736(91)93206-O |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)93206-O}} Later publications distinguish between "syndrome" and "infarct", based on evidence from imaging. "Syndrome" may be replaced by "hemorrhage" if imaging demonstrates a bleed.

* The TOAST (Trial of [[Danaparoid|Org 10172]] in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations; on this basis, a stroke is classified as being due to (1) thrombosis or embolism due to [[atherosclerosis]] of a large artery, (2) embolism of [[heart|cardiac]] origin, (3) occlusion of a small blood vessel, (4) other determined cause, (5) undetermined cause (two possible causes, no cause identified, or incomplete investigation).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adams HP, Bendixen BH, Kappelle LJ, ''et al.'' |title=Classification of subtype of acute ischemic stroke.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of cerebral infarction are determined by topographical localisation of cerebral lesion. If the infarct is located in primary motor cortex- contralateral hemiparesis is said to occur. With [[brainstem]] localization, brainstem syndromes are typical: [[Lateral medullary syndrome|Wallenberg's syndrome]], [[Weber's syndrome]], [[Millard-Gubler syndrome]], [[Benedikt syndrome]] or others.
Infarctions will result in weakness and loss of sensation on the opposite side of the [[body]]. Physical examination of the [[head]] area will reveal abnormal pupil dilation, [[Pupillary light reflex|light reaction]] and lack of [[human eye|eye]] movement on opposite side. If the infarction occurs on the left side brain, speech will be slurred. [[Reflexes]] may be aggravated as well.

==Causes==
In thrombotic cerebral infarction a thrombus  usually forms around [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] plaques. 
An embolic stroke refers to the blockage of an artery by an [[Embolism|embolus]], a traveling particle or debris in the arterial bloodstream originating elsewhere. An embolus is most frequently a thrombus, but it can also be a number of other substances including [[Fat embolism|fat]] (e.g. from [[bone marrow]] in a [[Bone fracture|broken bone]]), [[Air embolism|air]], [[cancer]] cells or clumps of [[bacteria]] (usually from infectious [[endocarditis]]). The embolus may be of cardiac origin due to [[Atrial fibrillation]], [[Foramen_ovale_(heart)|Patent foramen ovale]]  or from [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] plaque of another (or the same) large artery.

===Risk factors===
Risk factors for cerebral infarction are generally the same as for [[atherosclerosis]]: [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[tobacco smoking]], [[hypercholesterolemia]],  [[hyperlipoproteinemia]], [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[obesity]].

==Diagnosis==
[[Computed tomography]] (CT) and [[MRI]] scanning will show damaged area in the brain, showing that the symptoms were not caused by a [[tumor]], [[subdural hematoma]] or other brain disorder. The blockage will also appear on the [[angiogram]].

==Treatment==
In last decade, similar to myocardial infarction treatment, thrombolytic drugs were introduced in the therapy of cerebral infarction. The use of intravenous [[Tissue plasminogen activator|rtPA]] therapy can be advocated in patients who arrive to stroke unit and can be fully evaluated within 3 h of the onset.

If cerebral infarction is caused by a [[thrombus]]  occluding blood flow to an artery supplying the brain, definitive therapy is aimed at removing the blockage by breaking the clot down ([[thrombolysis]]), or by removing it mechanically ([[thrombectomy]]). The more rapidly blood flow is restored to the brain, the fewer brain cells die.<ref> {{cite journal |author=Saver JL |title=Time is brain - quantified |journal=Stroke |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=263–6 |year=2006 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/01.STR.0000196957.55928.abv1 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000196957.55928.ab |pmid=16339467}}</ref> In increasing numbers of primary stroke centers, pharmacologic thrombolysis  with the drug [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (tPA), is used to dissolve the clot and unblock the artery.
Another intervention for acute cerebral ischaemia is removal of the offending thrombus directly. This is accomplished by inserting a catheter into the [[femoral artery]], directing it into the [[cerebral circulation]], and deploying a corkscrew-like device to ensnare the clot, which is then withdrawn from the body. Mechanical embolectomy devices have been demonstrated effective at restoring blood flow in patients who were unable to receive [[Thrombolysis|thrombolytic drugs]] or for whom the drugs were ineffective,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Flint AC, Duckwiler GR, Budzik RF, Liebeskind DS, Smith WS |title=Mechanical thrombectomy of intracranial internal carotid occlusion: pooled results of the MERCI and Multi MERCI Part I trials |journal=Stroke |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=1274–80 |year=2007 |pmid=17332445 |doi= 10.1161/01.STR.0000260187.33864.a7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith WS, Sung G, Starkman S, ''et al.'' |title=Safety and efficacy of mechanical embolectomy in acute ischemic stroke: results of the MERCI trial |journal=Stroke |volume=36 |issue=7 |pages=1432–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15961709 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000171066.25248.1d|url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/36/7/1432}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lutsep HL, Rymer MM, Nesbit GM |title=Vertebrobasilar revascularization rates and outcomes in the MERCI and multi-MERCI trials |journal=J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=55–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18346645 |doi=10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2007.11.003}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith WS |title=Safety of mechanical thrombectomy and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator in acute ischemic stroke.

[[Angioplasty]] and [[stent]]ing have begun to be looked at as possible viable options in treatment of acute cerebral ischaemia. In a [[systematic review]] of six uncontrolled, single-center trials, involving a total of 300 patients, of intra-cranial stenting in symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis, the rate of technical success (reduction to stenosis of <50%) ranged from 90-98%, and the rate of major peri-procedural complications ranged from 4-10%.  The rates of restenosis and/or stroke following the treatment were also favorable.<ref name="pmid">{{cite journal |author=Derdeyn CP, Chimowitz MI |title=Angioplasty and Stenting for Atherosclerotic Intracranial Stenosis: Rationale for a Randomized Clinical Trial |journal=Neuroimaging Clin.

If studies show carotid stenosis, and the patient has residual function in the affected side, [[carotid endarterectomy]] (surgical removal of the stenosis) may decrease the risk of recurrence if performed rapidly after cerebral infarction. [[Carotid endarterectomy]] is also indicated to decrease the risk of cerebral infarction for symptomatic carotid stenosis (>70 to 80 % reduction in diameter). <ref>{{Cite book

In tissue losses that are not immediately fatal, the best course of action is to make every effort to restore impairments through [[physical therapy]], [[speech therapy]] and [[exercise]].
