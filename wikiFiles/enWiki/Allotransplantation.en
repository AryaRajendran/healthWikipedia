'''Allotransplantation''' (''allo-'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning "other") is the [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] of [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[Biological tissue|tissues]], or [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], to a recipient from a genetically non-identical donor of the same species.<ref>[http://www.ehealthmd.com/library/acltears/ACL_surgery.html#allograft Surgery For ACL Tears]</ref> The transplant is called an '''allograft''', '''allogeneic transplant''', or '''homograft'''. Most human tissue and [[organ transplant]]s are allografts.

An immune response against an allograft or xenograft is termed [[Transplant rejection|rejection]]. An allogenic bone marrow transplant can result in an immune attack  termed [[Graft versus host|Graft-versus-host disease]].

==Procedure==
Informed consent is required before tissue is harvested from a donor, alive or dead.  Proper screening for pathology and risk factors for communicable diseases such as [[HIV]] and [[Viral hepatitis|Hepatitis B and C]] is then conducted.  

In the US donor tissue must be harvested and processed adhering to the [[Current Good Tissue Practices]] rule. In most cases it is sent to tissue banks for processing and distribution. Each year, [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulated and [[American Association of Tissue Banks]]-accredited tissue banks distribute 1.5 million bone and tissue allografts.

==Transplantable organs and tissues==
{{main|Transplantable organs and tissues}}
A variety of organs and tissues can be used for allografts, including:
*[[Anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) repair
*Joint reconstruction in the [[Knee replacement|knee]] and [[Ankle replacement|ankle]]
*Meniscal replacement
*Reconstruction due to cancer or trauma
*Ridge augmentation in dental procedures
*[[Shoulder surgery|Shoulder repair]]
*[[Spinal fusion]]
*[[Urology|Urological procedures]]
*[[skin]] transplants
*[[cornea]]l transplants
*[[heart transplantation|heart transplants]]
*[[heart valves]]
*lung transplantation
*Intestinal transplantation (Isolated Small Bowel, Intestine & Liver, Multivisceral)
*[[liver transplantation|liver transplants]]
*[[kidney transplantation|kidney transplants]]
*[[bone marrow transplant]]s
*[[bone]] allograft
*[[ligament]] or [[tendon]] allograft

==Laws & regulations==
In the US, the Federal government Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulated human tissue intended for transplants since 1993. In order to ensure the quality of donor tissue and reduce contamination and disease transmission risks three regulations addressing manufacturing activities associated with human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) were promulgated in May 2005: The first requires companies producing and distributing HCT/Ps to register with the FDA. The second, called the “Donor Eligibility” rule, proscribes criteria for donor eligibility. The third, the “Current Good Tissue Practices” rule, oversees overall processing and distribution practices of each company.

==Other tranplant options==
*[[Autograft]], tissue transplanted from one site to another on the same patient. An autograft reduces the risk of rejection but requires a second surgery site, adding pain, risk and possible longer aftercare.

*[[Xenograft]], a transplant from another species 

*[[Isograft]], a transplant from a genetically identical donor, such as an identical twin.

*Synthetic and metal implants. Unlike allografts, such grafts do not incorporate into the body.
