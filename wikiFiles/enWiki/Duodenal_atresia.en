'''Duodenal atresia''' is the congenital absence or complete closure of a portion of the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[duodenum]].  It causes increased levels of amniotic fluid during pregnancy ([[polyhydramnios]]) and intestinal obstruction in newborn babies.  Radiography shows a distended stomach and distended duodenum, which are separated by the pyloric valve, a finding described as the "double-bubble sign."  

Treatment includes suctioning out any fluid that is trapped in the stomach, providing fluids intravenously, and surgical repair of the intestinal closure.  

==Epidemiology==
Duodenal atresia occurs in 1 in every 5,000-10,000 live births.<ref name=RapidDx>{{cite journal|last=Kimura|first=Kim|coauthors=Loening-Baucke, V|title=Bilious vomiting in the newborn: rapid diagnosis of intestinal obstruction.|journal=American family physician|date=2000 May 1|volume=61|issue=9|pages=2791–8|pmid=10821158|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0501/p2791.html|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref>   

==Associated conditions==
Approximately 20–40 percent of all infants with duodenal atresia have [[Down syndrome]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. Approximately 8% all infants with Down syndrome have duodenal atresia.<ref name="titleDuodenal Atresia">{{cite web |url=http://brighamrad.harvard.edu/Cases/bwh/hcache/35/full.html |title=Duodenal Atresia |accessdate=2007-12-03 |work=}}</ref>

==History and Physical Exam==
During pregnancy, duodenal atresia is associated with increased [[amniotic fluid]] in the uterus, which is called [[polyhydramnios]].<ref name="titleDuodenal Atresia"/>  This increase in amniotic fluid is caused by the inability of the fetus to swallow the amniotic fluid and absorb it in their digestive tract.  

After birth, duodenal atresia may cause abdominal distension, especially of the upper abdomen.  Bilious vomiting commonly occurs within the first day of life.  The vomiting is described as "bilious," because it contains bile acid.  

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of duodenal atresia is usually confirmed by [[radiography]].  An [[X-ray]] of the abdomen shows two large air filled spaces, the so-called "double bubble" sign.<ref name="pmid15912365">{{cite journal |author=Poki HO, Holland AJ, Pitkin J |title=Double bubble, double trouble |journal=Pediatr. Surg. Int. |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=428–31 |year=2005 |pmid=15912365 |doi=10.1007/s00383-005-1448-z}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Traubici J |title=The double bubble sign |journal=Radiology |volume=220 |issue=2 |pages=463–4 |year=2001 |month=August |pmid=11477252 |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/220/2/463 }}</ref> The air is trapped in the stomach and proximal duodenum, which are separated by the [[pyloric sphincter]], creating the appearance of two bubbles visible on x-ray.  Since the closure of the duodenum is complete in duodenal atresia, no air is seen in the distal duodenum.

Atresias occurring distal to the duodenum are usually caused by vascular accidents or ischemic insult, such as jejunoileal atresia.

==Treatment==
Early treatment includes [[Gastric lavage|removing fluids from the stomach]] via a [[nasogastric tube]], and providing fluids [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]].<ref name=RapidDx /> The definitive treatment for duodenal atresia is surgery (duodenoduodenostomy), which may be performed [[Open surgery|openly]] or [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopically]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Spilde|first=Troy L|coauthors=St Peter, SD; Keckler, SJ; Holcomb GW, 3rd; Snyder, CL; Ostlie, DJ|title=Open vs laparoscopic repair of congenital duodenal obstructions: a concurrent series.|journal=Journal of pediatric surgery|year=2008|month=June|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1002–5|pmid=18558173|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022346808001577|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> The surgery is not urgent.<ref name=RapidDx/> The initial repair has a 5 percent morbidity and mortality rate.<ref name=LongTerm>{{cite journal|last=Escobar|first=Mauricio A|coauthors=Ladd, AP; Grosfeld, JL; West, KW; Rescorla, FJ; Scherer LR, 3rd; Engum, SA; Rouse, TM; Billmire, DF|title=Duodenal atresia and stenosis: long-term follow-up over 30 years.|journal=Journal of pediatric surgery|year=2004|month=June|volume=39|issue=6|pages=867-71; discussion 867-71|pmid=15185215|url=http://www.jpedsurg.org/article/S0022-3468(04)00108-3/abstract|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref>

==Complications==
Prognosis is usually very good, although complications are more likely to occur when there are serious congenital anomalies.<ref name=RapidDx /> Late complications may occur in about 12 percent of patients with duodenal atresia, and the mortality rate for these complications is 6 percent.<ref name=LongTerm />
