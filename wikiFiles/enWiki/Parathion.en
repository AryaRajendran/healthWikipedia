'''Parathion''', also called '''parathion-ethyl''' or '''diethyl parathion''', is an [[organophosphate compound]]. It is a potent [[insecticide]] and [[acaricide]]. It was originally developed by [[IG Farben]] in the 1940s. It is highly toxic to non-target organisms, including humans.  Its use is banned or restricted in many countries, and there are proposals to ban it from all use. Closely related is "methyl parathion" (see below).

==Parathion-methyl==
"Parathion-methyl" (CAS#298-00-0), also known as methyl parathion or dimethyl parathion, was also developed and is marketed for similar uses.  It is a distinct compound with diminished toxicity. Some trade names of parathion-methyl include '''Bladan M''', '''Metaphos''', '''ME605''', and '''E601'''.

<center>[[File:Methyl-parathion-from-xtal-2005-3D-balls.png|200px|Ball-and-stick model of the methyl parathion molecule]]</center>

==History==
[[File:E605-forte.jpg|thumb|Bottle with E605]]
Parathion was developed by [[Gerhard Schrader]] for the [[Germany|German]] trust [[IG Farben]] in the 1940s.  After the war and the collapse of IG Farben due to the war crime trials, the Western allies seized the [[patent]], and parathion was marketed worldwide by different companies and under different brand names. The most common German brand was '''E605''' (banned in Germany after 2002); this was not a food-additive "[[E number]]" as used in the EU today. "E" stands for ''Entwicklungsnummer'' (German for "development number").

==Handling properties==
When pure, parathion is a white crystalline solid, however it is commonly distributed as a brown [[liquid]] that smells of rotting [[Egg (food)|egg]]s or [[garlic]]. The insecticide is more or less stable, although it darkens when exposed to sunlight.

==Industrial synthesis==
Parathion is synthesized from [[diethyl dithiophosphoric acid]] (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>PS<sub>2</sub>H, which is obtained by treatment of [[phosphorus pentasulfide|P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>]] with ethanol ([[methanol]] is used to prepare methyl parathion).  Diethyl dithiophosphoric acid is chlorinated to generate diethylthiophosphoryl chloride, which is then treated with [[sodium 4-nitrophenolate]] (the [[sodium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[4-Nitrophenol|4-nitrophenol]]).<ref name = fee>{{cite book |last=Fee |first=D.

: (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>P(S)Cl + NaOC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>   →   (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>P(S)OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>  +  NaCl

==Applications==
As a pesticide, parathion is generally applied by spraying.  It is often applied to [[cotton]], [[rice]] and [[fruit]] trees. The usual concentrations of ready-to-use solutions are 0.05 to 0.1%. The chemical is banned for use on many food crops.

==Insecticidal activity==
Parathion acts on the enzyme [[acetylcholinesterase]], but indirectly.  After being ingested by insects (and unintentionally, by humans), the parathion becomes oxidized by [[oxidase]]s to give [[paraoxon]], replacing the double bonded sulfur with oxygen.<ref name = metcalf>{{cite book |last=Metcalf |first=R. L. |chapter=Insect Control |title=Ullman’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA |location=New York |year=2002 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a14_263 }}</ref>

:(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>P(S)OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>  +  1/2 O<sub>2</sub> →   (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>P(O)OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>  +  S

The phosphate ester is more reactive in organisms than the phosphorothiolate ester, as the phosphorus atoms become much more electronegative.<ref name = metcalf/>

==Degradation==
Degradation of parathion leads to more water soluble products.  [[Hydrolysis]], which deactivates the molecule, occurs at the [[aryl ester]] bond resulting in [[diethyl thiophosphate]] and [[4-nitrophenol]].<ref name = metcalf/>
:(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>P(S)OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O →  HOC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> + (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>P(S)OH
Degradation proceeds differently under [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] conditions: the nitro group on parathion is reduced to the [[amine]].
:(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>P(S)OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> +  6 H →  (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>P(S)OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>O

==Safety==
Parathion is a [[cholinesterase inhibitor]]. It generally disrupts the [[nervous system]] by inhibiting [[acetylcholinesterase]]. It is absorbed via skin, mucous membranes, and orally. Absorbed parathion is rapidly metabolized to paraoxon, as described above. Paraoxon exposure can result in [[headache]]s, [[convulsions]], poor vision, [[vomiting]], abdominal pain, severe [[diarrhea]], [[unconsciousness]], [[tremor]], [[dyspnea]], and finally [[edema|lung-edema]] as well as respiratory arrest.  Symptoms of poisoning are known to last for extended periods of time, sometimes months. The most common and very specific antidote is [[atropine]], in doses of up to 100&nbsp;mg daily. Because atropine may also be toxic, it is recommended that small frequently repeated doses be used in treatment. If human poisoning is detected early and the treatment is prompt (atropine and artificial respiration), fatalities are infrequent. Insufficient oxygen will lead to [[cerebral hypoxia]] and permanent brain damage.  [[Peripheral neuropathy]] including [[paralysis]] is noticed as late [[sequelae]] after recovery from acute intoxication. Parathion has been used for committing suicide and deliberately poisoning other persons. It is known as "Schwiegermuttergift" (mother-in-law poison) in Germany. For this reason, most formulations contain a blue dye providing warning.

Parathion has been used as a [[chemical weapon]], most notably by the [[Selous Scouts#Composition|Selous Scouts]] during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Moorcraft |first=Paul |last2=McLaughlin |first2=Peter |title=The Rhodesian War: A Military History |location=Yorkshire |publisher=Pen & Sword |year=2008 |page=106 |isbn=9781844156948 }}</ref>

Based on animal studies, parathion is considered by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] to be a possible human [[carcinogen]].<ref name=epa>{{cite web | title = Parathion | work = Integrated Risk Information System | publisher = [[U. S. Environmental Protection Agency]] | date = 26 January 2007 | url = http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0327.htm}}</ref> Studies show that parathion is toxic to fetuses, but does not cause birth defects.<ref name = extoxnet>{{cite web | work = Extension Toxicology Network | title = Pesticide Information Profiles - Parathion | publisher = [[Oregon State University]] | month = September | year = 1993 | url = http://extoxnet.orst.edu/pips/parathio.htm}}</ref>

It is classified as a [[UNEP]] [[Persistent Organic Pollutant]] and [[WHO]] [[Toxicity Class]], "Ia, Extremely Hazardous".

Parathion is very toxic to [[bees]], [[fish]], [[bird]]s, and other forms of wildlife.<ref name = extoxnet/> Parathion can be replaced by many safer and less toxic alternatives (less toxic [[organophosphate]]s, [[carbamate]]s, or synthetic [[pyrethroid]]s).

===Protection against poisoning===
To provide the end user with a minimum standard of protection, suitable protective gloves, clothing, and a respirator with organic-vapour cartridges must be worn. [[Industrial safety]] during the production process requires special ventilation and continuous measurement of air contamination in order not to exceed PEL levels, as well as paying careful attention to personal hygiene. Frequent analysis of workers' serum acetylcholinesterase activity is also helpful with regards to occupational safety, because the action of parathion is cumulative. If an area of the body is contaminated with parathion, the contamination should be removed immediately and thoroughly. Also, atropine has been used as a specific antidote.

==Proposals to ban==
According to the non-governmental organisation [[Pesticide Action Network]] or PAN, parathion is one of the most dangerous pesticides. This organization lists parathion also as a 'bad actor chemical'.<ref name = panid>{{cite web | title = Parathion - Identification, toxicity, use, water pollution potential, ecological toxicity and regulatory information | publisher = [[Pesticide Action Network]] | author = S. Kegley, B. Hill, S. Orme | url = http://pesticideinfo.org/Detail_Chemical.jsp?Rec_Id=PC35122}}</ref> In the US alone more than 650 agricultural workers have been poisoned since 1966, of which 100 died. In underdeveloped countries many more people have suffered fatal and nonfatal intoxications. The [[World Health Organization]], PAN and numerous environmental organisations propose a general and global ban. Its use is banned or restricted in 23 countries and its import is illegal in a total of 50 countries.<ref name=panid/>
