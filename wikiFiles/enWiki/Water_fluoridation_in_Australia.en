[[Australia]] is one of many countries that have [[water fluoridation]] programs currently operating (see [[Fluoridation by country]]). As of March 2012, artificially fluoridated drinking water is provided for 70% or more of the population in all states and territories. The acceptance of the benefits of water fluoridation occurred in Australia in December 1953, roughly two years after acceptance in the United States.<ref>[http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:8724/Water_September_.pdf Water Fluoridation: The Engineers' Contribution]</ref> Many of Australia's drinking water supplies subsequently began fluoridation in the 1960s and 1970s. By 1984 almost 66% of the Australian population had access to fluoridated drinking water, represented by 850 towns and cities.<ref name="parliament">[http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/downloads/reports/1SP%20Flouridation%20part%201%20of%204.pdf Inquiry into Water Fluoridation in the ACT - Report by the Standing Committee on Social Policy, 1991]</ref><ref name="commonwealth">Commonwealth Department of Health, Fluoridation of Water: A Collection. 9; Commonwealth Department of Health, Fluoridation of Water in Australia 1984 (Canberra: Australian Government Publishing Service, 1985), 13.</ref> Some areas within Australia have [[Fluoride#Natural_occurrence|natural fluoride]] levels in the groundwater, which was estimated in 1991 to provide drinking water to approximately 0.9% of the population.<ref name="parliament" />

A key difference between the implementation of drinking water fluoridation in the United States and Australia was the impact of temperature and climate on water consumption. Temperatures are a key factor in the establishment of legislative requirements, such as the Water Fluoridation Regulation 2008<ref>[http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/W/WatrFluorR08.pdf Water Fluoridation Regulation 2008]</ref> in Queensland, that prescribe concentrations of fluoride to be added to the water. Consequently, areas with higher average temperatures require less fluoride to be added to the drinking water to achieve the same oral health benefits. The tropical conditions found in parts of Australia, such as Queensland, also make it difficult to maintain fluoridation equipment due to higher levels of corrosion caused by the wet climate.

The addition of fluoride to a drinking water supply is generally governed by the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines/publications/eh52|title=Australian Drinking Water Guidelines 2011|year=2011|publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council|accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> The Guidelines recommend a health-related guideline value (maximum concentration) of 1.5&nbsp;mg/L for fluoride, which mirrors the [[World Health Organisation]] Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/gdwq3rev/en/|title=Guidelines for drinking-water quality|year=2006|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref>  Guidance on the concentration of fluoride has been present in the Guidelines since 1983.

The Health Minister may then choose to direct the water authority to add fluoride to the water.

== New South Wales ==
Approximately 95% of the population has access to fluoridated water (Sep 2011). Fluoridation commenced in [[New South Wales]] with [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] in 1956,<ref>[http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/factsheets/general/water_fluoridation.html Water Fluoridation Factsheet - New South Wales Department of Health]</ref> with [[Sydney]] fluoridating in 1968.<ref name="parliament" /> The use of fluoride is regulated by the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Act 1957,<ref>[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/inforcepdf/1957-58.pdf?id=58a392ae-69c5-11dd-8fae-00144f4fe975 Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Act 1957]</ref> and the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Regulation 2007.<ref>[http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/resources/aboutus/legal/pdf/fluoridereg.pdf Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Regulation 2007]</ref>

== Australian Capital Territory ==
Fluoride has been added to water supplies in [[Canberra]] and the City of [[Queanbeyan]] since 1964. The addition of fluoride is regulated by the Electricity and Water (Amendment) Act (No. 2) 1989 <ref>[http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/1989-13/19891009-5120/pdf/1989-13.pdf Electricity and Water (Amendment) Act (No. 2) 1989]</ref> and the Public Health (Drinking Water) Code of Practice 2007 (No 1) <ref>[http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/di/2007-62/current/pdf/2007-62.pdf Public Health (Drinking Water) Code of Practice 2007 (No 1)].</ref> There was a brief period in 1989 where fluoridation was suspended following a formal review of the effectiveness of fluoridation on oral health.<ref name="parliament" /> As only one water supplier provides all of the water for these areas, the percentage of the population with access to fluoridated water has always been 100% during the times in which it was added.

== Western Australia ==
Water fluoridation was introduced in [[Western Australia]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1968, and is regulated by the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Act 1966.<ref>[http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/pco/prod/FileStore.nsf/Documents/MRDocument:5473P/$FILE/FluoridationofPublWatrSuppliesAct1966_01-d0-02.pdf?OpenElement Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Act 1966]</ref> As of 2012, around 92% of the population is provided with fluoridated water through a drinking water supply.<ref>[http://www.public.health.wa.gov.au/cproot/4320/2/Fluoride%20in%20Drinking%20Water.pdf Fluoride in Drinking Water Factsheet - Western Australia Department of Health]</ref> An exception exists in the [[Busselton]], [[Vasse, Western Australia|Vasse]] and [[Wonnerup]] townsites (approximately 20,000 residents), where fluoride is not artificially added to the water because it has naturally occurring fluoride.<ref>[http://www.busseltonwater.wa.gov.au/OurWater.aspx Busselton Water (Understanding our Natural Groundwater Resource)]</ref> Proposals for the addition of fluoride to a public water supply or matters relating to the Act and its administration are dealt with by the Advisory Committee for the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies.<ref>[http://www.public.health.wa.gov.au/3/1584/2/advisory_committee_for_the_fluoridation_of_public_.pm Advisory Committee for the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies]</ref>

== South Australia ==
Water fluoridation commenced in [[Adelaide]] in 1971. There is no legal requirement to add fluoride to drinking water supplies. As of 2010, 90% of the state’s communities have access to reticulated water with appropriate levels of fluoride.<ref>[http://www.dh.sa.gov.au/pehs/fluoridation-facts.htm Fluoridation Facts - South Australia Department of Health]</ref>

== Northern Territory ==
Fluoride has been added to public water supplies in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] (since 1972), [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]], and [[Gove Peninsula|Gove]]. Similar to South Australia, there is no legal requirement to add fluoride to the Northern Territory's water supplies, but a position paper <ref>[http://www.health.nt.gov.au/library/scripts/objectifyMedia.aspx?file=pdf/59/82.pdf&siteID=1&str_title=Position%20Statement%20-%20The%20use%20of%20Fluorides%20in%20the%20Northern%20Territory.pdf Position Statement: The use of fluorides in the Northern Territory]</ref> published in November 2010 strongly encourages water providers to add fluoride where possible.

== Victoria ==
Fluoride was first added to the drinking water for the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n town of [[Bacchus Marsh, Victoria|Bacchus Marsh]] in 1962, with [[Melbourne]] beginning fluoridation in 1977.<ref>Dedman, R. and Neil, A.

== Queensland ==
[[Image:Percentage of Queensland population with access to fluoridated water.jpg|thumb|Queensland residents served with community water fluoridation, 2011]]
On 29 November 2012 the Queensland Parliament, with a [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] government, reversed the previous [[Australian Labor Party|Labour]] government's mandate requiring certain public potable water supplies to add fluoride to the water. As a consequence of these changes local councils in Queensland have the choice to add fluoride to drinking water supplies, similar to the conditions in place under the previous legislation. In January 2013 the [[Cairns]] council decided to discontinue water fluoridation<ref>{{cite web|title=Cairns Council brushes fluoride from water supply

The previous government, under [[Queensland]] Premier [[Anna Bligh]], announced on 5 December 2007 that the mandatory fluoridation of most of Queensland's water supplies will begin in 2008.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/12/05/2110402.htm Qld to get fluoridated water - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]</ref> When it was enacted the Water Fluoridation Act 2008 required the addition of fluoride to any water supply supplying potable water to at least 1000 members of the public, unless an exemption is granted based on safety or naturally occurring levels that meet the required levels.<ref>[http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/2008/08AC012.pdf Water Fluoridation Act 2008]</ref> The fluoridation of drinking water supplies is regulated by [[Queensland Health]],<ref>[http://www.health.qld.gov.au/fluoride/ Queensland Health Fluoride Website]</ref> with implementation supported by the former [[Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation]].<ref>[http://www.deedi.qld.gov.au/cg/qld-fluoridation-capital-assistance-program.html Queensland Fluoridation Capital Assistance Program]</ref> Prior to this legislation Queensland was the only Australian state without a formal statewide program for the addition of fluoride to drinking water.  

The accompanying Water Fluoridation Regulation 2008 listed 134 drinking water supplies that were to be fluoridated by 31 December 2012.<ref>[http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/SLS/2008/08SL394.pdf Water Fluoridation Regulation 2008, Schedule 1]</ref> Of the drinking water supplies listed in the Regulation, 32 comprised the [[SEQ Water Grid]] located in [[South East Queensland|Southeast Queensland]]. The fluoridation of these supplies by the end of 2009 accounted for the largest increase in people currently receiving fluoridated water in Queensland (approximately 2.6 million people in 2006 or 68% of the Queensland population). 

Before the 2008 legislation the addition of fluoride to water supplies was regulated by the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Act 1963.<ref>[http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/REPEALED/F/FluorPubWaSuA63_01C_051208.pdf Fluoridation of Water Supplies Act 1963]</ref> Under this legislation only 5% of drinking water supplies were fluoridated. Queensland was unique in that it did not pursue water fluoridation like all the other Australian States and Territories, with only 7 of the 850 fluoridated supplies in 1984 operating in Queensland.<ref name="commonwealth" /> Those supplies operated in the towns of [[Biloela]], [[Dalby]], [[Gatton, Queensland|Gatton]], [[Mareeba]], [[Moranbah]], and [[Townsville]]/[[Thuringowa]], with some adding fluoride to their drinking water since 1972. A few of these towns stopped adding fluoride prior to the Water Fluoridation Act 2008.<ref>Impact Analysis of Water Fluoridation, December 2002, Prepared for Queensland Health by Jaguar Consulting Pty Ltd. Retrieved from http://www.lgaq.asn.au/ on 4 April 2012.</ref>  

Several areas of Queensland, such as [[Julia Creek]], [[Quilpie]], [[Thargomindah]] and [[Adavale]] are known to have naturally occurring fluoride present in their drinking water, a characteristic that has been studied since the late 1920s.<ref>{{citation |title=Interim Report of the Fluoride in Waters Survey Committee |publisher=Department of Agriculture and Stock |location=Brisbane |year=1947 |author=Parkinson, C.E., et al.}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv.php?pid=UQ:8581&dsID=n0406Ake1.pdf |title=An historical perspective on early progress of Queensland water fluoridation 1945-1954: sheep, climate and sugar |author = H.
