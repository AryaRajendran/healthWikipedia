Although there are behavioral similarities, psychopathy and ASPD, according to criteria in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', are not synonymous. The diagnosis of ASPD covers two to three times as many prisoners as those that have been labeled psychopaths.

== Etymology ==
The word "psychopathy" is a joining of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words psyche ψυχή (soul) and pathos πάθος (suffering, feeling).<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=psychopathy&searchmode=phrase "Psychopathy", Online Etymology Dictionary] Retrieved August 1st 2011</ref> The first documented use is from 1847 in [[Germany]] as ''psychopatisch'',<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=psychopathic&allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary: Psychopathic] Retrieved January 21st 2012</ref> and the noun ''psychopath'' has been traced to 1885.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=psychopath&allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary: Psychopath] Retrieved January 21st 2012</ref> 

In medicine, ''patho-'' has long had a specific meaning of [[disease]]. Thus ''[[pathology]]'' has meant the study of disease since 1610, and ''[[psychopathology]]'' the study of [[mental disorder]] since 1847. A sense of "worthy to be a subject of pathology, morbid, excessive" is attested from 1845,<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pathological&allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary: Pathological] Retrieved January 21st 2012</ref> including the phrase ''[[pathological liar]]'' from 1891 in the medical literature.

''[[Psychosis]]'' was also used in Germany from 1841, including in a general sense of any mental derangement. The suffix -ωσις (-osis) meant in this case "abnormal condition". This term or its adjective ''psychotic'' would come to refer specifically to mental states or disorders characterized by [[hallucinations]], [[delusions]] or being in some other sense out of touch with [[reality]].<ref name=Burgy>{{cite journal |last=Burgy|first=M.|title=The Concept of Psychosis: Historical and Phenomenological Aspects|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|date=20 August 2008|volume=34|issue=6|pages=1200–1210|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm136|url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/6/1200.full.pdf|pmid=18174608|pmc=2632489}}</ref>

The term psychopathy initially had a very general meaning too, referring to all sorts of mental disorders. Some medical dictionaries still define it in the narrow and broad sense, for example [[MedlinePlus]] from the U.S. [[National Library of Medicine]].<ref>Medlineplus [http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/psychopath Psychopath] or [http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/psychopathy Psychopathy] Retrieved January 21st 2012</ref> Others, such as [[Stedman's Medical Dictionary]], define it only as an outdated term for an antisocial type of personality disorder.<ref>Medilexicon powered by Stedman's, part of Lippincott Williams & Wilkins [http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=73686 Psychopath] Retrieved January 21st 2012</ref> 

The [[slang]] ''psycho'' has been traced to 1936 as a shortening of the adjective ''psychopathic'', and from 1942 as a shortening of the noun ''psychopath'',<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=psycho&allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary: Psychopathic]</ref> and it can also be short for psychotic.<ref>[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/psycho?rdfrom=Psycho Wiktionary: Psycho] Retrieved January 22nd 2012</ref>

The label ''psychopath'' has been described as strangely nonspecific but probably persisting because it indicates that the source of behavior lies in the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] rather than in the situation. The media usually uses the term to designate any criminal whose offenses are particularly abhorrent and unnatural, but that is not its original or general psychiatric meaning.<ref name=lykken>Lykken, David T.

==Measurement instruments==

===Psychopathy Checklist===
{{Main|Hare Psychopathy Checklist}}
Psychopathy is most commonly assessed with the [[Hare Psychopathy Checklist|Psychopathy Checklist, Revised]] (PCL-R) created by psychologist [[Robert D. Hare]]. Each of the 20 items in the PCL-R is scored on a three-point scale, with a rating of 0 if it does not apply at all, 1 if there is a partial match or mixed information, and 2 if there is a reasonably good match to the offender. This is said{{whom?|date=April 2013}} to be ideally done through a face-to-face interview together with supporting information on lifetime behavior (e.g. from case files), but is also done based only on file information. It can take up to three hours to collect and review the information.<ref name=gap/>

The PCL-R is referred to by some as the "gold standard"{{whom?|date=April 2013}} for assessing psychopathy. It was developed with and for criminal samples, based on the pioneer [[Hervey Cleckley]]'s mid-20th century's characterization but with his positive-adjustment indicators omitted. High PCL-R scores are positively associated with measures of [[impulsivity]] and [[aggression]], [[Machiavellianism]], persistent criminal behavior, and negatively associated with measures of [[empathy]] and affiliation. 30 out of a maximum score of 40 is recommended as the cut-off for the label of psychopathy, although there is little scientific support for this as a particular break point. For research purposes a cut-off score of 25 is sometimes used.<ref name=gap/> In fact, the UK has used a cut-off of 25 rather than the 30 used in the United States.<ref name=semple/>

The PCL-R items were designed to be split in two. Factor 1 involves interpersonal or affective (emotion) personality traits and higher values are associated with [[narcissism]] and low empathy as well as social dominance and less fear or depression. Factor 2 involves either impulsive-irresponsible behaviors or antisocial behaviors and is associated with a maladaptive lifestyle including criminality. The two factors correlate with each other to some extent.<ref name=gap/> Each factor is sometimes further subdivided in two - interpersonal vs affect items for Factor 1, and impulsive-irresponsible lifestyle vs antisocial behavior items for Factor 2. "Promiscuous sexual behavior" and "many short-term marital relationships" have sometimes been left out in such divisions (Hare, 2003).

Cooke and Michie have argued that a three-factor structure provide a better model than the two-factor structure. Those items from factor 2 strictly relating to antisocial behavior (criminal versatility, juvenile delinquency, revocation of conditional release, early behavioral problems, and poor behavioral controls) are removed. The remaining items are divided into three factors: Arrogant and Deceitful Interpersonal Style, Deficient Affective Experience, and Impulsive and Irresponsible Behavioral Style.<ref name=cookemichie>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1040-3590.13.2.171 |title=Refining the construct of psychopath: Towards a hierarchical model |year=2001 |last1=Cooke |first1=David J. |last2=Michie |first2=Christine |journal=Psychological Assessment |volume=13 |pages=171–88 |pmid=11433793 |issue=2}}</ref> Hare and colleagues have published detailed critiques of the model and argue that there are statistical and conceptual problems.<ref name=hareneumann>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091452 |title=Psychopathy as a Clinical and Empirical Construct |year=2008 |last1=Hare |first1=Robert D. |last2=Neumann |first2=Craig S. |journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology |volume=4 |pages=217–46 |pmid=18370617|url=http://www.hare.org/references/HareandNeumannARCP2008.pdf}}</ref>

Because an individual's scores may have important consequences for his or her future, the potential for harm if the test is used or administered incorrectly is considerable. The test can only be considered valid if administered by a suitably qualified and experienced clinician under controlled conditions.<ref name=hare2>Hare, R. D., & Neumann, C. N. (2006).

Toronto, ON, Canada: Multi-Health Systems.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

There is also a shorter version of the PCL-R, known as a screening version (PCL-SC), developed for quicker assessments of larger numbers or groups without criminal records. It has only 12 items and a maximum scores of 24 but correlates strongly with the main PCL-R. The corresponding cut-off score is 18.

Hare's concept and checklist have also been criticized. In 2010 there was controversy after it emerged Hare had threatened legal action that stopped publication of a peer-reviewed article on the PCL-R. Hare alleged the article quoted or paraphrased him incorrectly. The article eventually appeared three years later. It alleged that the checklist is wrongly viewed by many as the basic definition of psychopathy, yet it leaves out key factors, while also making criminality too central to the concept. The authors claimed this leads to problems in overdiagnosis and in the use of the checklist to secure convictions.{{contradiction-inline|date=April 2013}} Hare has clarified that he receives less than $35,000 a year from [[royalties]] associated with the checklist and its derivatives.<ref>Minkel, JR.

In addition, Hare's concept of psychopathy has been criticised as being only weakly applicable to real-world settings and tending towards [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]].{{contradiction-inline|date=April 2013}} It is also said to be vulnerable to "labeling effects"; to be over-simplistic; reductionistic; to embody the [[fundamental attribution error]]; and to not pay enough attention to context and the dynamic nature of human behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walters|first=Glenn D.|title=The Trouble with Psychopathy as a General Theory of Crime|journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology|date=1 April 2004|volume=48|issue=2|pages=133–148|doi=10.1177/0306624X03259472|pmid=15070462}}</ref> Some research suggests that ratings made using this system depend on the personality of the person doing the rating, including how empathic they themselves are.

Unlike the PCL, the [[Psychopathic Personality Inventory]] (PPI) was developed to comprehensively index personality traits without explicitly referring to anti-social or criminal behaviors themselves. It is a self-report scale that was developed in non-clinical samples (e.g. university students) rather than prisoners, though may be used with the latter. It was revised in 2005 to become the PPI-R (Lilienfeld & Widows) and now comprises 154 items organized into eight subscales. The item scores have been found to group into two overarching and largely separate factors (unlike the PCL-R factors), plus a third factor which is largely independent on scores on the other two:<ref name=gap/>

I: Fearless dominance. From the subscales Social influence, Fearlessness, and Stress immunity. Associated with less anxiety, depression, and empathy as well as higher well-being, assertiveness, narcissism, and thrill-seeking.

II: Impulsive antisociality. From the subscales "[[Machiavellian]]" egocentricity, Rebellious nonconformity, Blame externalization, and Carefree lack of planning. Associated with impulsivity, aggressiveness, substance use, antisocial behavior, negative affect, and suicidal ideation.

III: Coldheartedness. From a subscale with the same name.

A person may score at different levels on the different factors, but the overall score indicates the extent of psychopathic personality. Factor I is associated with social efficacy while factor 2 is associated with maladaptive tendencies.<ref name=gap/>

===Other===
There are some traditional [[personality tests]] that contain subscales relating to psychopathy, though they assess relatively non-specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior. These include the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (Psychopathic Deviate scale); the [[California Psychological Inventory]] (Socialization scale); and the [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory]] (Antisocial Personality Disorder scale). There is also the [[Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale]] (LSRP) and the Hare Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (HSRP). However, in terms of self-report tests, the PPI/PPI-R has become the most used in modern psychopathy research on adults.<ref name=gap/>

===DSM and ICD===
There are currently two widely established systems for classifying [[mental disorders]] &mdash; Chapter V of the [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD-10) produced by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) produced by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). Both list categories of disorders thought to be distinct types, and have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The DSM has never listed psychopathy as the official term for a personality disorder, although it shares behavioral characteristics with ASPD, which is characterized by "... a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood", and requires three out of seven specific factors to be present. The ICD's conceptually similar diagnosis is called Dissocial personality disorder, "usually coming to attention because of a gross disparity between behaviour and the prevailing social norms, and characterized by" 3 of 6 specific issues.<ref name="Patrick2005a"/><ref name="dissocial">[http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-pe04.html Dissocial Personality Disorder]</ref>

Although there are behavioral similarities, ASPD according the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' criteria and psychopathy are not synonymous. A diagnosis of ASPD is based on behavioral patterns, whereas psychopathy measurements also include personality characteristics. The diagnosis of ASPD covers two to three times as many prisoners as are rated as psychopaths. Most offenders scoring high on the PCL-R also pass the ASPD criteria but most of those with ASPD do not score high on the PCL-R.<ref name=Patrick2005a/><ref name=semple>{{cite book | first=David | last= Semple | year= 2005| url=http://books.google.com/?id=1MeRuoTs0loC&pg=PA448&lpg=PA448&dq=dissocial+personality+disorder| title= The Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry | edition=| publisher=Oxford University Press | location=USA| pages= 448–449 | isbn=0-19-852783-7}}</ref> Some who meet criteria for ASPD may only score high on Factor 2 of the PLC-R.<ref name="Davison, G.C. 2002">Davison, G.C., Neale, J.M., Blankstein, K.R., & Flett, G.L. (2002). ''Abnormal Psychology.'' (Etobicoke: Wiley){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> 

Proponents claim that the Psychopathy Checklist is better able to predict future criminality, violence, and recidivism than the diagnosis of ASPD. Hare writes that there are also differences between PLC psychopaths and others on "processing and use of linguistic and emotional information", while such differences are small between those diagnosed with ASPD and not.<ref name=Hare1996>[http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/dsm-iv/content/article/10168/54831 "Psychopathy and Antisocial Personality Disorder: A Case of Diagnostic Confusion"]. Robert D. Hare, Ph.D. ''Psychiatric Times''. Vol. 13 No. 2. February 1, 1996.</ref><ref name=HareHarpur/> However, the Hare Psychopathy Checklist requires the use of a rather long interview and availability of considerable additional information<ref name=HareHarpur>Hare, R.D., Hart, S.D., Harpur, T.J. [http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/~peterson/psy430s2001/Hare%20RD%20Psychopathy%20JAP%201991.pdf Psychopathy and the DSM—IV Criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder] (PDF).</ref> as well as depending in part on judgments of character rather than observed behavior. 

Hare wrote that the field trials for the DSM-IV found personality traits judgments to be as reliable as those diagnostic criteria relying only on behavior, but that the personality traits criteria were dropped in part because it was feared that the average clinician would not use them correctly. Hare criticizes the instead used DSM-IV criteria for being poorly empirically tested. In addition, the introductory text description describes the personality characteristics typical of psychopathy, which Hare argues make the manual confusing and actually containing two different sets of criteria. He has also argued that confusion regarding how to diagnose ASPD, confusion regarding the difference between ASPD and psychopathy, as well as the differing future prognoses regarding recidivism and treatability, may have serious consequences in settings such as court cases where psychopathy is often seen as aggravating the crime.<ref name=Hare1996/>

The [[DSM-V]] working party is recommending a revision of ASPD to be called antisocial/dyssocial personality disorder.<ref>DSM-V revision panel [http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=16 T 04 Antisocial Personality Disorder (Dyssocial Personality Disorder)]. Retrieved January 23, 2012.</ref> There is also a suggestion to include a subtype "Antisocial/Psychopathic Type".<ref>http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=438#</ref>

==Other classification issues ==

===Distinct condition or not ===
A crucial issue regarding the concept of psychopathy is whether it identifies a distinct condition that can be separated from other conditions and "normal" personality types, or whether it is simply a combination of scores on various dimensions of personality found throughout the population in varying combinations. 

An early and influential  analysis from Harris and colleagues indicated a discrete category may underlie PCL-R psychopathy, but this was only found for the behavioral Factor 2 items, indicating this analysis may be related to ASPD rather than psychopathy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harris GT, Rice ME, Quinsey VL |title=Psychopathy as a taxon: evidence that psychopaths are a discrete class |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=387–97 |year=1994 |month=April |pmid=8201078 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.62.2.387}}</ref>  Marcus, John, and Edens more recently performed a series of statistical analysis on PPI scores and concluded psychopathy may best be conceptualized as having a "dimensional latent structure" like [[Clinical depression|depression]].<ref name="taxon">{{cite journal |author=Marcus DK, John SL, Edens JF |title=A taxometric analysis of psychopathic personality |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=113 |issue=4 |pages=626–35 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15535794 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.113.4.626}}</ref>

Marcus et al. repeated the study on a larger sample of prisoners, using the PCL-R and seeking to rule out other experimental or statistical issues that may have produced the previously different findings. They again found that the psychopathy measurements do not appear to be identifying a discrete type (a [[taxon]]). They suggest that while for legal or other practical purposes an arbitrary cut-off point on trait scores might be used, there is actually no clear scientific evidence for an objective point of difference by which to call some people "psychopaths". The Hare checklist was developed for research not clinical forensic diagnosis, and even for research purposes to improve understanding of the underlying issues, it is necessary to examine dimensions of personality in general rather than only this constellation of traits.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Edens|first=John F.|coauthors=Marcus, David K., Lilienfeld, Scott O., Poythress, Norman G., Jr.|title=Psychopathic, Not Psychopath: Taxometric Evidence for the Dimensional Structure of Psychopathy|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=115|issue=1|pages=131–144|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.115.1.131|url=http://peezer.squarespace.com/storage/moral-reasoning/psychopath%20not%20psychopath.pdf|pmid=16492104}}</ref>

=== Triarchic model ===
The triarchic model argues that various concepts of psychopathy can be explained by three factors:<ref name=gap/> 
* Boldness. Low fear including stress-tolerance, toleration of unfamiliarity and danger, and high self-confidence and social assertiveness. PCL-R measures this relatively poorly and mainly through Facet 1 of Factor 1. Similar to PPI Fearless dominance. May correspond to differences in the [[amygdala]] and other neurological systems associated with fear.
* Disinhibition. Poor impulse control including problems with planning and foresight, lacking affect and urge control, demand for immediate gratification, and poor behavioral restraints. Similar to PCL-R Factor 2 and PPI Impulsive antisociality. May correspond to impairments in [[frontal lobe]] systems that are involved in such control.
* Meanness. Lacking empathy and close attachments with others, disdain of close attachments, use of cruelty to gain empowerment, exploitative tendencies, defiance of authority, and destructive excitement seeking. PCL-R in general is related to this but in particular some elements in Factor 1. Similar to PPI Coldheartedness but also includes elements of subscales in Impulsive antisociality. Meanness may possibly be caused by either high boldness or high disinhibition combined with an adverse environment. Thus, a child with high boldness may respond poorly to punishment but may respond better to rewards and secure attachments which may not be available under adverse conditions. A child with high disinhibition may have increased problems under adverse conditions with meanness developing in response.<ref name=gap/><ref name="doi10.1017/S0954579409000492">{{cite doi|10.1017/S0954579409000492}}</ref>

===Psychopathy vs. sociopathy===
====General====
Hare notes that ''sociopathy'' and ''psychopathy'' are often used interchangeably, but in some cases the term ''sociopathy'' is preferred because it is less likely than is ''psychopathy'' to be confused with [[psychosis|psychoticism]], whereas in other cases which term is used may "reflect the user's views on the origins and determinates of the disorder," with the term ''sociopathy'' preferred by those that see the causes as due to social factors and early environment, and the term ''psychopathy'' preferred by those who believe that there are psychological, biological, and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors.<ref name="Without Conscience">{{cite book |last=Hare|first=Robert D.|authorlink =Robert D. Hare|title=Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|year=1999|isbn=1-57230-451-0}}</ref>

====Contemporary biological understanding====
Psychopathy and sociopathy can be separated by the following categories: good guys and bad guys. Good guys, played by actors as [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Mel Gibson]] and [[John Wayne]], depict a predictable set of behaviors people can allot to the definition of psychopath.<ref name="Various sources">Anderson, S.

===Primary-secondary distinction===
Several researchers have argued that there exist two variants of psychopathy. There is also empirical support for separating persons scoring high on the PCL-R into two groups that do not simply reflect Factor 1 and Factor 2. There is at least preliminary evidence of differences regarding cognition and affect as measured in laboratory tests. Different theories characterize these two variants somewhat differently. Compared to "primary" psychopaths, researchers agree that "secondary" psychopaths have more fear, anxiety, and negative emotions. They are often seen as more impulsive and with more reactive anger and aggression. Some preliminary research have suggested that secondary psychopaths may have had a more abusive childhood according to self-reports (which possibly may be inflated in secondary psychopathy), may have a higher risk of future violence, and may respond better to treatment.<ref name=gap/>

Primary psychopathy has been seen as mainly due to genetic factors while secondary psychopathy has been seen as mainly due to environmental factors which also has implications for treatment possibilities. Such proposed environmental factors include an abusive childhood or a society presenting opportunities for cheating. Other researchers have argued that genetics and environment are important for both variants. [[David T. Lykken]], using [[Gray's biopsychological theory of personality]], have argued that primary psychopaths innately have little fear while secondary psychopaths innately have increased sensitivity to rewards. Proponents of the triarchic model described above see primary psychopaths associated with increased boldness and secondary psychopathy as associated with increased disinhibition.<ref name=gap/>

===Other personality dimensions===
Some studies have linked psychopathy to other dimensions of personality. These include antagonism (high), [[conscientiousness]] (low) and [[anxiousness]] (low, or sometimes high). However, there are different views as to which personality dimensions are more central in regard to psychopathy, and in addition the traits are found throughout the general population in differing combinations.<ref name=handbook>Millon, Theodore; Davis, Roger D. "Chapter 11: The Five-Factor Model of Personality, ''Psychopathy: Antisocial, Criminal, and Violent Behavior.''</ref> Some have also linked psychopathy to high [[psychoticism]] - a theorized dimension referring to tough, aggressive or hostile tendencies.<ref name="bare_url">Marvin Zuckerman (1991) [http://books.google.com/books?id=TA01Duy4RLwC&pg=RA1-PA390 ''Psychobiology of personality''] Cambridge University Press, p. 390. ISBN 0-521-35942-2</ref>

Aspects of this that appear associated with psychopathy are lack of socialization and responsibility, impulsivity, sensation-seeking in some cases, and aggression.<ref name="bare_url"/> [[Otto Kernberg]], from a particular psychoanalytic perspective, believes psychopathy should be considered as part of a spectrum of pathological [[narcissism]], that would range from narcissistic personality on the low end, [[malignant narcissism]] in the middle, and psychopathy at the high end.<ref>{{cite book | first=Kernberg | last=Otto F. | year=2004| title= Aggressivity, Narcissism, and Self-Destructiveness in the Psychotherapeutic Relationship: New Developments in the Psychopathology and Psychotherapy of Severe Personality Disorders| publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=0-300-10180-5}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> However, narcissism is generally seen as only one aspect of psychopathy as generally defined.

===Cleckley checklist===
In his book ''[[Mask of Sanity]]'', [[Hervey M. Cleckley]] described 16 "common qualities" that he thought were characteristic of the individuals he termed psychopaths:<ref>Cleckley, [http://www.cix.co.uk/~klockstone/sanity_1.pdf The Mask of Sanity: An attempt to clarify some issues about the so-called psychopathic personality] pp.338-339 (5th ed.)</ref>  Cleckley checklist formed the basis for Hare's more current PCL-R checklist (see above).

{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
#Superficial charm and good "intelligence"
#Absence of delusions and other signs of irrational thinking
#Absence of "nervousness" or [[neurosis|psychoneurotic]] manifestations
#Unreliability
#Untruthfulness and insincerity
#Lack of remorse and shame
#Inadequately motivated antisocial behavior
#Poor judgment and failure to learn by experience
#Pathologic [[egocentricity]] and incapacity for love
#General poverty in major affective reactions
#Specific loss of insight
#Unresponsiveness in general interpersonal relations
#Fantastic and uninviting behavior with [[alcohol|drink]] and sometimes without
#Suicide threats rarely carried out
#Sex life impersonal, trivial, and poorly integrated
#Failure to follow any life plan.
}}

Cleckley also suggested there were milder forms. He ended his survey by saying "If we consider, in addition to these patients (nearly all of whom have records of the utmost folly and misery and idleness over many years and who have had to enter a
psychiatric hospital), the vast number of similar people in every community who show the same behavior pattern in milder form but who are sufficiently protected and supported by relatives to remain at large, the prevalence of this disorder is seen to be appalling."<ref>Cleckley, [http://www.cix.co.uk/~klockstone/sanity_1.pdf The Mask of Sanity: An attempt to clarify some issues about the so-called psychopathic personality] pp.452 (5th ed.)</ref>

==Moral judgment==
Psychopaths have been considered notoriously [[amorality|amoral]]&nbsp;– an absence of, indifference towards, or disregard for moral beliefs. There are little firm data on patterns of moral judgment, however. Studies of developmental level (sophistication) of moral reasoning found all possible results&nbsp;– lower, higher or the same as non-psychopaths. Studies that compared judgments of personal moral transgressions versus judgments of breaking conventional rules or laws, found that psychopaths rated them as equally severe, whereas non-psychopaths rated the rule-breaking as less severe.<ref name="KoenigsKruepkeZeierNewman">{{cite journal |last=Koenigs|first=M.|coauthors=Kruepke, M., Zeier, J., Newman, J. P.|title=Utilitarian moral judgment in psychopathy|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|date=18 July 2011|doi=10.1093/scan/nsr048|url=http://koenigslab.psychiatry.wisc.edu/pdfs/Koenigs%20SCAN%20psychopathy%20moral%20judgment.pdf|volume=7|issue=6|pages=708–14|pmid=21768207|pmc=3427868}}</ref>

A study comparing judgments of whether personal or impersonal harm would be endorsed in order to achieve the rationally maximum ([[utilitarian]]) amount of welfare, found no significant differences between psychopaths and non-psychopaths. However, a further study using the same tests found that prisoners scoring high on the psychopathy checklist were more likely to endorse impersonal harm or rule violations than non-psychopaths were. Psychopaths who scored low in anxiety were also more willing to endorse personal harm on average.<ref name="KoenigsKruepkeZeierNewman"/> 

Assessing accidents, where one person harmed another unintentionally, psychopaths judged such actions to be more
morally permissible. This result is perhaps a reflection of psychopaths' failure to appreciate the emotional aspect of the victim's harmful experience, and furnishes direct evidence of abnormal moral judgment in psychopathy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Young |first1= L. |last2= Koenigs |first2= M. |last3= Kruepke |first3= M. |last4= Newman |first4= J. |year= 2012 |title= Psychopathy increases perceived moral permissibility of accidents |url= http://moralitylab.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/YoungKoenigsPsychopathy.pdf |journal= Journal of Abnormal Psychology |issue= in press |doi= 10.1037/a0027489 |volume= 121 |pages= 659 }}</ref>

== Intelligence==
Hare and Neumann (2008) state that a large literature shows that there is at most only a weak association between psychopathy and [[IQ]]. They consider that the early pioneer Cleckley included high IQ in his checklist due to [[selection bias]] since many of his patients were "well educated and from middle-class or upper-class backgrounds" and state that "there is no obvious theoretical reason why the disorder described by Cleckley or other clinicians should be related to intelligence; some psychopaths are bright, others less so."<ref name=HareNeumann2008>{{cite doi|10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091452}}</ref>

In addition, studies indicate that different aspects of the definition of psychopathy (e.g. interpersonal, affective (emotion), behavioral and lifestyle components) can show different links to intelligence, and it can also depend on the type of "[[intelligence]]" assessment (e.g. verbal IQ, creative, practical, analytical). Those scoring high on psychopathy measures may tend to score lower on verbal IQ.<ref name=LecterMyth>{{cite journal |last=DeLisi|first=Matt|coauthors=Vaughn, Michael G., Beaver, Kevin M., Wright, John Paul|title=The Hannibal Lecter Myth: Psychopathy and Verbal Intelligence in the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|date=NaN undefined NaN|volume=32|issue=2|pages=169–177|doi=10.1007/s10862-009-9147-z|url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/staff/delisi/Hannibal%20Lecter%20PDF.pdf}}</ref>

According to R. J. R. Blair, psychopaths demonstrate impairment in stimulus-reinforced learning (whether punishment-based or reward-based).<ref name="pmid18434283" /> This may be due to dysfunctions in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.<ref name="pmid18434283" /> People scoring ≥25 in the [[Psychopathy Checklist Revised]], with an associated history of violent behavior, appear to have significantly reduced microstructural integrity in their [[uncinate fasciculus]] &mdash; [[white matter]] connecting the amygdala and [[orbitofrontal cortex]].<ref name="craig2009" /> There is DT-MRI evidence of breakdowns in the [[white matter]] connections between these two important areas.<ref name="pmid19506560-0" /><ref name="pmid19506560-1" />

==Co-occurrence with other mental conditions==
Psychopaths may have various other mental conditions.<ref name=BlairMitchellBlair>{{cite book |title=Psychopathy, emotion and the brain |last=Blair |first=J |coauthor=Mitchel D; Blair K |year=2005 |isbn=0-631-23336-9 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |pages=25–27|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/27005161/The-Psychopath-Emotion-and-the-Brain}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> It has been found that psychopathy scores correlated with "[[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], and [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] personality disorders ... but not [[neurosis|neurotic]] disorders or [[schizophrenia]]".<ref name="coid et al">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.ijlp.2009.02.008}}</ref> Additionally, the constellation of traits in psychopathy assessments overlaps considerably with ASPD criteria and also with histrionic personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder criteria.<ref name=Nedopil>{{cite book |chapter=Comorbidity of psychopathy with major mental disorders |last=Nedopil |first=N |coauthor=Hollweg, M; Hartmann, J; Jaser, R |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-7923-4919-9 |title=Psychopathy: Theory, Research and Implications for Society (NATO Science Series D) |editor1-first=DJ |editor2-first=AE |editor3-first=RD |editor-last=Cooke |editor2-last=Forth |editor3-last=Hare}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

Psychopathy is associated with [[substance use disorders]]. This appears to be linked more closely to anti-social/criminal lifestyle, as measured by Factor 2 of the PCL-R, than the interpersonal-emotional traits assessed by Factor I of the PCL-R.<ref name=BlairMitchellBlair/><ref>Smith SS, Newman JP.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2266219 Alcohol and drug abuse-dependence disorders in psychopathic and nonpsychopathic criminal offenders].</ref><ref name=Kantor>{{cite book |last=Kantor |first=Martin |title=The Psychopathy of Everyday Life |isbn=0-275-98798-1 |year=2006|page=107}}</ref> 

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]) is known to be highly comorbid with [[conduct disorder]], and may also co-occur with psychopathic tendencies. This may be explained in part by deficits in [[executive functions|executive function]].<ref name=BlairMitchellBlair/>

[[Anxiety disorders]] often co-occur with ASPD, and contrary to assumptions psychopathy can sometimes be marked by anxiety; however, this appears to be due to the antisocial aspect (factor 2 of the PCL), and anxiety may be inversely associated with the interpersonal-emotional traits (Factor I of the PCL-R). {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] appears to be inversely associated with psychopathy. There is little evidence for a link between psychopathy and schizophrenia.<ref name=BlairMitchellBlair/>

It has been suggested that psychopathy may be comorbid with several other diagnoses than these,<ref name=Kantor/> but limited work on comorbidity has been carried out. This may be partly due to difficulties in using inpatient groups from certain institutions to assess comorbidity, owing to the likelihood of some bias in sample selection.<ref name=BlairMitchellBlair/>

==Offending==
The majority of crimes, including violent crimes, are committed by a small part of the population (5-7%). However, those who repeatedly commit crimes are a heterogeneous group with varying personality characteristics and psychopathy cannot be said to be ''the'' underlying type.<ref name=gap/>

=== Correlation with criminality ===
The PCL-R manual state an average score of 22.1 in North American prisoners samples and that 20.5% scored 30 or higher. An analysis of prisoner samples from outside North America found a somewhat lower average value of 17.5.<ref name=Patrick2005b>Patrick, Christopher J  (Editor). (2005) Handbook of Psychopathy. Guilford Press. Pages 440-443.</ref> A diagnosis of ASPD is about two to three times as common in prisoners as a label of psychopathy is.<ref name="Patrick2005a"/> A 2009 study by Coid et al. of a representative sample of British prisoners, unlike selected samples used in many other studies, found a prevalence of PCL-R > 30 in 7.7% of men and in 1.9% of women. Psychopathy scores "correlated with younger age, repeated imprisonment, detention in higher security, disciplinary infractions, antisocial, narcissistic, histrionic, and schizoid personality disorders, and substance misuse, but not neurotic disorders or schizophrenia." Most correlations were similar to those in other studies.<ref name="coid et al" />

Psychopathy, as measured with the PCL-R in institutional settings, show in [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] small to moderate [[effect size]]s (''[[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|r]]'' = 0.23 to 0.30) with institutional misbehavior, postrelease crime, or postrelease violent crime with similar effects for the three outcomes. Individual studies give similar results for adult offenders, forensic psychiatric samples, community samples, and youth. The PCL-R is poorer at predicting sexual re-offending.<ref name=gap/>

However, this link appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past criminal history, which are well-established but very general risk factors. The aspects of core personality often held to be distinctively psychopathic, generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves. Thus Factor 1 of the PCL-R and Fearless dominance of the PPI-R have smaller or no relationship to crime, including violent crime. In contrast Factor 2 and Impulsive antisociality of the PPI-R are associated more strongly with criminality. Factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength to that of the PCL-R as a whole. The antisocial facet of the PCL-R is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past criminal behavior which, together with results regarding the PPI-R which by design does not include past criminal behavior, suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor.<ref name=gap/> 

Some clinicians suggest that assessment of the [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of psychopathy does not necessarily add value to violence [[risk assessment]]. There are several other risk assessment instruments which can predict further crime with an accuracy similar to the PCL-R and some of these are considerably easier, quicker, and less expensive to administrate. This may even be done automatically by a computer simply based on data such as age, gender, number of previous convictions, and age of first conviction. Some of these  assessments may also identify treatment change and goals, identify quick changes that may help short-term management, identify more specific kinds of violence that may be at risk, and may have established specific probabilities of offending for specific scores. PCL-R may continue to be popular for risk assessment because of is pioneering role and the large amount of research done using it.<ref name=gap/><ref>Jeremy F. Mills, Daryl G. Kroner, Robert D.

=== Violence ===
Links have been suggested that psychopaths tend to commit more "instrumental" violence than "reactive" violence. One conclusion in this regard was made by a 2002 study of homicide offenders, which reported that the homicides committed by psychopaths were almost always (93.3%) primarily instrumental, while about half (48.4%) of those committed by non-psychopaths were.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1037//0021-843X.111.3.436}}</ref> However, contrary to the equating of this to mean "in cold blood", more than a third of the homicides by psychopaths involved emotional reactivity as well.<ref name="gap" />

In addition, the non-psychopaths still accounted for most of the instrumental homicides, because most of these murderers were not psychopaths. In any case, FBI profilers indicate that serious victim injury is generally an emotional offense, and some research supports this, at least with regard to sexual offending. One study has found more serious offending by non-psychopaths on average than by psychopaths (e.g. more homicides versus more armed robbery and property offenses) and another that the Affective facet of PCL-R predicted reduced offense seriousness.<ref name="gap" />

=== Sexual offending ===
A 2011 study of conditional releases for Canadian male federal offenders found that psychopathy was related to more violent and non-violent offences but not more sexual offences. For [[child sexual abuse|child molesters]], psychopathy was associated with more offences. Despite "their extensive criminal histories and high recidivism rate", psychopaths showed "a great proficiency in persuading parole boards to release them into the community." It is purported that high-psychopathy offenders (both sexual and non-sexual offenders) are about 2.5 times more likely to be granted conditional release compared to non-psychopathic offenders."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Porter|first=Stephen|coauthors=Brinke, Leanne, Wilson, Kevin|title=Crime profiles and conditional release performance of psychopathic and non-psychopathic sexual offenders|journal=Legal and Criminological Psychology|date=1 February 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=109–118|doi=10.1348/135532508X284310|url=https://people.ok.ubc.ca/stporter/Publications_files/Crime%20profiles%20and%20conditional%20release%20of%20psychopathic%20sexual%20offenders.pdf}}</ref> 

Some studies have found only weak associations between psychopathy and sexual offending overall. The association is more certain for [[sexual violence]]. Psychopaths have higher sexual arousal to depictions of [[rape]] than non-psychopaths. Rapists, especially sadistic rapists, and sexual homicide offenders have a high rate of psychopathy. Some researchers have argued that psychopaths have a preference for violent sexual behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Williams|first=K. M.|coauthors=Cooper, B. S., Howell, T. M., Yuille, J. C., Paulhus, D.

One study examined the relationship between psychopathy scores and types of aggression expressed in a sample of 38 sexual murderers. 84.2% of the sample had PCL-R scores above 20 and 47.4% above 30. 82.4% of those above 30 had engaged in sadistic violence (defined as enjoyment indicated by self-report or evidence) as compared to 52.6% of those below and total PCL-R and Factor 1 scores correlated significantly with sadistic violence.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Porter|first=S|coauthors=Woodworth, M, Earle, J, Drugge, J, Boer, D|title=Characteristics of sexual homicides committed by psychopathic and nonpsychopathic offenders|journal=Law and human behavior|date=2003 Oct|volume=27|issue=5|pages=459–70|pmid=14593792|url=https://people.ok.ubc.ca/stporter/Publications_files/sexual%20homicide.pdf|doi=10.1023/A:1025461421791}}</ref> In considering the challenging issue of possible reunification of some [[sex offenders]] into homes with a non-offending parent and children, it has been advised that any sex offender with a significant criminal history should be assessed on the PCL-R, and if they score 18 or higher than they should be excluded from any consideration of being placed in a home with children under any circumstances.<ref>Jill S.

=== Other offending ===
[[Terrorists]] are sometimes called psychopaths, and comparisons can be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence, a selfish worldview that precludes welfare for others, lack of remorse or guilt, and blaming external events. However, such comparisons could also then be drawn more widely, for example to soldiers in wars. In addition, it has been noted that coordinated terrorist activity requires organization, loyalty and ideology; traits such as self-centeredness, unreliability, poor behavioral controls, and unusual behaviors may be disadvantages.<ref>Horgan, J. (2005) [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=75LraX59rXcC&vq=psychopath&source=gbs_navlinks_s The Psychology of Terrorism.] Pg 49 USA: Routledge</ref> 

Recently Häkkänen-Nyholm and Nyholm (2012) have discussed the possibility of psychopathy being associated with organised crime, economic crime and war crimes.
<ref>Häkkänen-Nyholm, H. & Nyholm, J-O. (2012) [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UY7ryLZAETIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=psychopathy+and+law+a+guide&hl=fi&sa=X&ei=Oq94T_n0EeuO4gTNxdWcCQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=psychopathy%20and%20law%20a%20guide&f=false Psychopathy and Law: A Practitioners Guide.] Pg 177 UK: John Wiley & Sons</ref> 

It has been speculated that some psychopaths may be socially successful, due to factors such as low disinhibition in the triarchic model in combination with other advantages such as a favorable upbringing and good intelligence. However, there is little research on this, in part because the PCL-R does not include positive adjustment characteristics and most research have used the PCL-R on criminals. Some research using the PPI indicate that psychopathic interpersonal and affective traits/boldness and/or meanness in the triarchic model exist in noncriminals and correlate with stress immunity and stability.<ref name=gap/> 

Psychologists Fritzon and Board, in their study comparing the incidence of personality disorders in business executives against criminals detained in a mental hospital, found that some personality disorders were more common in the executives. They described the personality-disordered executives as "successful psychopaths" and the personality-disordered criminals as "unsuccessful psychopaths".<ref>Board, B.J. & Fritzon, Katarina, F. (2005). Disordered personalities at work. Psychology, Crime and Law, 11, 17-32</ref>

== Sex differences ==
Research on psychopathy have largely been done on men and the PCL-R was developed using mainly male criminal samples raising the question how well the results apply to women. There have also been research investigating the sex differences. Men score higher than women on both the PCL-R and the PPI and on both of their main scales. The differences tend to be somewhat larger on the interpersonal-affective scale than on the antisocial scale. Most but not all studies have found broadly similar [[Factor analysis|factor structure]] for men and women.<ref name=gap/>

Many associations with other personality traits are similar although in one study the antisocial factor was more strongly related with impulsivity in men and more strongly related with [[openness to experience]] in women. It has been suggested that psychopathy in men manifest more as an antisocial pattern while it in women manifests more as a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] pattern. Studies on this have shown mixed results. PCL-R scores may be somewhat less predictive of violence and recidivism women. On the other hand, psychopathy may have stronger relationship with suicide and possibly internalizing symptoms in women. A suggestion is that psychopathy manifest more as externalizing behaviors in men and more as internalizing behaviors in women.<ref name=gap/>

==Causes and pathophysiology==

===Childhood and adolescent precursors===
The "Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version" (PCL:YV) is an adaptation of the PCL-R for 13–18 years old. It is, like the PCL-R, done by a trained rater based on an interview and an examination of criminal and other records. The "Antisocial Process Screening Device" (APSD) is also an adaptation of the PCL-R. It can be administered by parents or teachers for 6–13 year olds or it can be self-administered by 13–18 years olds. High psychopathy scores for both juveniles, as measured with these instruments, and adults, as measured with the PCL-R, have many similar associations with other variables. This include similar predictive ability regarding violence and criminality as well as this mainly being due to the scales measuring impulsive and antisocial behaviors rather than the scales measuring interpersonal and affective features. As for adults, several other measurement tools have similar predictive ability at risk assessment. One difference is that juvenile psychopathy appears to be associated with more negative emotionality such as anger, hostility, anxiety, and, depression. Some recent studies have also found poorer ability at predicting long-term, adult offending such as the predictive ability not being better than unaided clinical judgment in one study.<ref name=gap/><ref>http://www.hare.org/scales/pclyv.html</ref><ref>http://www.hare.org/scales/apsd.html</ref>

[[Conduct disorder]] is a diagnosis with similarities to ASPD.{{cn|date=April 2013}} The [[DSM-IV]] allows differentiating between childhood onset before age 10  and adolescent onset at age 10 and later. Childhood onset is argued to be more due to a  personality disorder caused by neurological deficits interacting with an adverse  environment. For many, but not all, is childhood onset associated with what is in [[Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime]] is referred to as "life-course- persistent" antisocial behavior as well as poorer health and economic status. Adolescent onset is argued to more typically be associated with short-term antisocial behavior. It has been suggested that the combination of early-onset conduct disorder and [[ADHD]] may be associated with life-course-persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy.<ref name=gap/>

There is evidence that this combination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone. However, it is not particularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have ADHD. Some evidence indicates that this group have deficits in behavioral inhibition similar to adult psychopaths. They may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing  characteristic of adult psychopaths. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult secondary psychopathy/disinhibition in the triarchic model.<ref name=gap/>

The [[DSM-V]] is proposing the specifier "[[Callous and unemotional traits|With Significant Callous-Unemotional Traits]]" which would require at least two out of four of features for at least a year: lacking of remorse/guilt, lacking empathy (callousness), lacking affect, and lacking concern for  performance. It has been suggested that this is a subgroup of early onset conduct disorder distinct from the larger group by having less deficits in inhibition, less fear and anxiety, less emotional reactivity and emotional negativity, more boldness and/or meanness, less intellectual impairment, and less exposure to poor parental practices although parental practices do affect outcomes for this group. It has been argued that this group is at increased risk for future of aggressive, criminal, and other antisocial behaviors but it is unclear how much the callous-unemotinal traits contribute to this since this group also often have higher impulsivity and more prior antisocial behavior compared to children with conduct disorder without callous-unemotional traits. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult primary psychopathy/boldness in the triarchic model.<ref name=gap/>

There are moderate to high correlations between psychopathy rankings from late childhood to early adolescence. The correlations are considerably lower from early- or mid-adolescence to adulthood. In one study most of the similarities were on the Impulsive- and Antisocial-Behavior scales. Of those adolescents who scored in the top 5% highest psychopathy scores at age 13, less than one third (29%) were classified as psychopathic at age 24.<ref name=gap/>

Three behaviors &mdash; [[Enuresis|bedwetting]], [[cruelty to animals]] and [[Pyromania|firestarting]], known as the [[Macdonald triad]] &mdash; were first described by [[J.M. MacDonald]] as possible indicators, if occurring together over time during childhood, of future episodic aggressive behavior.<ref name=macdonald>{{cite journal |author=J. M.

===Environmental===
A study by Farrington of a sample of London males followed between age 8 and 48 included studying which factors predicted scoring 10 or more on the PCL: SV at age 48. The strongest factors were "having a convicted father or mother, physical neglect of the boy, low involvement of the father with the boy, low family income, and coming from a disrupted family." Other significant factors included poor supervision, harsh discipline, large family size, delinquent sibling, young mother, depressed mother, low social class, and poor housing.<ref name=Patrick2005b>Patrick, Christopher J  (Editor). (2005) Handbook of Psychopathy. Guilford Press. Page 234,240.</ref>

There has also been association between psychopaths and detrimental treatment by peers. [[Henry Lee Lucas]], a [[serial killer]] and diagnosed psychopath, was [[bullied]] as a child and later said that his hatred for everyone spawned from mass [[social rejection]].<ref name="Without Conscience" /><ref name="Tick">{{cite web |first=Shirley Lynn|last=Scott|title=What Makes Serial Killers Tick?|publisher=[[truTV|truTV.com]]|accessdate=2013-01-10|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/tick/victims_1.html }}</ref>

Proponents of the triarchic model described earlier see psychopathy as due to the interaction of an adverse environment and genetic predispositions. What is adverse may differ depending on the underlying predisposition. Thus, persons having high boldness may respond poorly to punishment but may respond better to rewards and secure attachments.<ref name=gap/><ref name="doi10.1017/S0954579409000492"/>

===Genetics===
One approach to studying the role of genetics for crime is to calculate the [[heritability]] coefficient. It describes the proportion of the [[variance]] that is due to genetic factors for some characteristic that differs between individuals. The non-heritability proportion can be further divided into the "shared environment" which is the non-genetic factors which make siblings similar while the "non-shared environment" is the non-genetic factors which makes siblings different from another. Studies on the personality characteristics typical of psychopathy have found moderate genetic and moderate "non-shared environmental" influences while none from the "shared environment" A study using the PPI found the two factors fearless dominance and impulsive antisociality to be similarly moderately influenced by genetics and uncorrelated with one another which indicated separate genetic influences.<ref name=gap/><ref name=Glenn2011/>

Genetic factors may generally influence the development of psychopathy while environmental factors affect the specific traits that predominate.<ref name=HareNeumann2008/>

A study on a large group of children found more than 60% heritability for "callous-unemotional traits" and that conduct problems among children with these traits had a higher heritability than among children without these traits.<ref name=gap/>

==== MAO-A ====
Studies have suggested a connection between a variant of the [[monoamine oxidase A]] (MAO-A) gene (dubbed the "warrior gene") and psychopathy.<ref name= "pmid12161658">{{cite journal |author=Caspi A, McClay J, Moffitt TE, Mill J, Martin J, Craig IW, Taylor A, Poulton R | title = Role of genotype in the cycle of violence in maltreated children | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5582 | pages = 851–4 | year = 2002 | month = August | pmid = 12161658 | doi = 10.1126/science.1072290 | laysummary = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-08/uow-gmp072602.php | laysource = eurekalert.org | laydate = 2002-08-01 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17534436">{{cite journal |author=Frazzetto G, Di Lorenzo G, Carola V, ''et al.'' |title=Early trauma and increased risk for physical aggression during adulthood: the moderating role of MAOA genotype |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e486 |year=2007 |pmid=17534436 |pmc=1872046 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000486 |url= |editor1-last=Baune |editor1-first=Bernhard}}</ref> In the variant, the allele associated with behavioral traits consists of 30 bases, and produces comparatively less MAO-A enzyme.<ref name="pmid9799080">{{cite journal | author = Sabol SZ, Hu S, Hamer D | title = A functional polymorphism in the monoamine oxidase A gene promoter | journal = Hum.

The variant was found to vary widely in demographic prevalence among different ethnic groups. 59% of African-American men, 56% of Maori men and 54% of Chinese men carry the MOA-A 3R genetic variant, compared to 34% of Caucasians, suggesting that the former ethnic groups are more genetically predisposed by the MAO-A gene towards aggression or antisocial tendencies compared to other ethnic groups studied.<ref>Rod Lea, Geoffrey Chambers, Journal of the New Zealand Medical Association. 2 March 2007.

===Evolutionary explanations===
Psychopathy is associated with several adverse life outcomes as well as increased risk of early death due to factors such as homicides, accidents, and suicides. This in combination with the evidence for genetic influences is evolutionarily puzzling and may suggest that there are compensating evolutionary advantages. Researchers within [[evolutionary psychology]] have proposed several evolutionary explanations. Some psychopaths may possibly be very socially successful. Another is that some associated traits such as early, promiscuous, adulterous, and coercive sexuality may increase reproductive success. A third is that psychopathy represents a frequency-dependent, {{clarify span|socially [[parasitic]] strategy|date=November 2012}}. This may work as long as there are few other psychopaths in the community since more psychopaths means increasing the risk of encountering another psychopath as well as non-psychopaths likely adapting more countermeasures against cheaters.<ref name=gap/><ref name=Glenn2011>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.avb.2011.03.009}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01138.x}}</ref>

Criticisms include that it may be better to look at the contributing personality factors rather than treat psychopathy as a unitary concept due to poor testability and a lack of empirical evidence regarding reproductive success of psychopaths.  Furthermore, if psychopathy is caused by the combined effects of a very large number of adverse mutations then each mutation may have so small an effect that it escapes natural selection.<ref name=gap/>

===Neuroscience===
Psychopaths have in laboratory research responded differently to aversive stimuli. They have had weak [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] to painful stimuli and poor learning of avoiding responses that causes [[punishment]]. They have had low reactivity in the [[autonomic nervous system]] as measured with [[skin conductance]] while waiting for a painful stimuli but not when the stimuli occurs. While it has been argued that the [[reward system]] functions normally, some studies have also found reduced reactivity to pleasurable stimuli.<ref name=gap/>

Psychopaths have also had difficulty switching from an ongoing action despite environmental cues signaling a need to do so. One possibility is that this explains the difficulty responding to punishment although it is unclear if it can explain findings such as deficient conditioning. There may also be methodological issues regarding the research.<ref name=gap/>

Several studies have found that psychopaths have difficulty identifying certain [[facial expressions]]. This has been linked to the [[amygdala]] in patients with brain damage, but a recent meta-analysis suggested the deficits are not always found in psychopathy, and tend to show more on tasks requiring verbal processing (e.g. a verbal response to a questioner) at the same time as visual processing.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1177/0093854811404120}}</ref>

Neuroimaging studies have found structural and functional differences between those scoring high and low on the PCL-R with a 2011 review by Skeem et al. stating that they are "most notably in the [[amygdala]], [[hippocampus]] and [[parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal gyri]], anterior and posterior [[cingulate cortex]], [[striatum]], [[Insular cortex|insula]], and [[frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] [[cerebral cortex|cortex]]".<ref name=gap/> A 2008 review by Weber et al. stated that "psychopathy is associated with brain abnormalities in a [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]]-[[temporal lobe|temporo]]-[[limbic system|limbic]]—i.e. regions that are involved,among others, in emotional and learning processes."<ref name="review2008">{{Cite doi|10.1002/bsl.802}}</ref> The amygdala and frontal areas has been suggested as particularly important.<ref name="pmid18434283">{{cite doi|10.1098/rstb.2008.0027}}</ref> People scoring ≥25 in the [[Psychopathy Checklist Revised]], with an associated history of violent behavior, appear to have significantly reduced microstructural integrity in their [[uncinate fasciculus]] &mdash; [[white matter]] connecting the amygdala and [[orbitofrontal cortex]].

In a recent study of how psychopaths respond to emotional words, the right anterior temporal gyrus, whereby, wide spread differences in activation patterns have been shown across the temporal lobe when criminal psychopaths were compared to "normal" volunteers. This is consistent with the view of clinical psychology.<ref>Pridmore, S., Chambers, A., & McArthur , M. (2005). Neuroimaging in psychopathy. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 39(10), 856. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1614.2005.01679.x</ref>

There is DT-MRI evidence of breakdowns in the [[white matter]] connections between these two important areas in a small [[United Kingdom|British]] study of nine criminal psychopaths. This evidence suggests that the degree of abnormality was significantly related to the degree of psychopathy and may explain the offending behaviors.<ref name="pmid19506560-0">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/mp.2009.40 |title=Altered connections on the road to psychopathy |year=2009 |last1=Craig |first1=M C |last2=Catani |first2=M |last3=Deeley |first3=Q |last4=Latham |first4=R |last5=Daly |first5=E |last6=Kanaan |first6=R |last7=Picchioni |first7=M |last8=McGuire |first8=P K |last9=Fahy |first9=T |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=14 |pages=946–53, 907 |pmid=19506560 |issue=10}}</ref><ref name="pmid19506560-1">{{cite journal |author=Craig MC, Catani M, Deeley Q, ''et al.'' |title=Altered connections on the road to psychopathy |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=946–53, 907 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19506560 |doi=10.1038/mp.2009.40 |laysummary=http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/news/default.aspx?id=321 |laysource=Press Office Institute of Psychiatry, [[Kings College London]] |laydate=September 3, 2009}}</ref>

Some of these findings are consistent with other research and theories, such as psychopaths having low fear being consistent with changes in the amygdala. However, the amygdala has been associated also with positive emotions and there has been inconsistent results in the studies regarding particular areas. Also "callous-unemtional" traits in children has been associated with changes in the amygdala but again there may be methodological issues.<ref name=gap/>

Proponents of the primary-secondary psychopathy distinction and triarchic model discussed earlier argue that there are neuroscientific differences between subgroups of psychopaths supporting their views. Thus the boldness factor in the triarchic model is argued to be associated with reduced activity in the amygdala during fearful or aversive stimuli and reduced [[startle response]] while the disinhibition factor is argued to be associated with impairment of frontal lobe tasks. There is evidence that boldness and disinhibition are genetically distinguishable.<ref name=gap/>

=== Neurotransmitters and hormones ===
High levels of [[testosterone]] combined with low levels of [[cortisol]] have been theorized as contributing factors. Testosterone is "associated with approach-related behavior, reward sensitivity, and fear reduction". Cortisol increases "the state of fear, sensitivity to punishment, and withdrawal behavior". Injecting testosterone "shift[s] the balance from punishment to reward sensitivity", decreases fearfulness, and increases "responding to angry faces". Some studies have found that antisocial and aggressive behaviors are associated with high testosterone levels but it is unclear if psychopaths have high testosterone levels. A few studies have found psychopathy to be linked to low cortisol levels.<ref name=Glenn2008>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.psc.2008.03.004}}</ref>

High testosterone levels combined with low serotonin levels may increase violent aggression. Some research suggests that testosterone alone does not cause aggression but increases dominance-seeking behaviors. Low serotonin is associated with "impulsive and highly negative reactions" which, if combined with high testosterone, may cause aggression if an individual becomes frustrated.<ref name=Glenn2008/>

Psychopathy was also associated in two studies with an increased ratio of [[Homovanillic acid|HVA]] (a [[dopamine]] metabolite) to [[5-HIAA]] (a [[serotonin]] metabolite).<ref name=Glenn2008/>

[[Monoamine oxidase A]] affected the predictive ability of PCL-R in one study.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.psychres.2010.08.026}}</ref> 

Several animal studies note the role of [[serotonin|serotonergic]] functioning in impulsive aggression and antisocial behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0954579409000418 |pmc=2709751 |title=Multifinality in the development of personality disorders: A Biology × Sex × Environment interaction model of antisocial and borderline traits |pmid=19583882 |year=2009 |last1=Beauchaine |first1=Theodore P. |last2=Klein |first2=Daniel N. |last3=Crowell |first3=Sheila E. |last4=Derbidge |first4=Christina |last5=Gatzke-Kopp |first5=Lisa |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=735–70}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gollan JK, Lee R, Coccaro EF |title=Developmental psychopathology and neurobiology of aggression |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=1151–71 |year=2005 |pmid=16613435 |doi=10.1017/S0954579405050546}}</ref><ref>Lee R, Coccaro ER.

Studies have indicated that individuals with the traits meeting criteria for psychopathy show a greater [[dopamine]] response to potential "rewards" such as monetary promises or taking drugs such as amphetamines. This has been theoretically linked to an increased [[impulsivity]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Psychopaths' brains wired to seek rewards, no matter the consequences|date=March 14, 2010|first1=Joshua W.|last1=Buckholtz|work= [[Nature Neuroscience]] |url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v13/n4/abs/nn.2510.html|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>

A 2010 British study found that a large 2D:4D [[digit ratio]], an indication of high [[prenatal]] [[estrogen]] exposure, was a "positive correlate of psychopathy in females, and a positive correlate of callous affect (psychopathy sub-scale) in males".<ref>{{cite doi|10.5042/bjfp.2010.0183}}</ref>

==Management==

===Clinical management===
Psychopathy has often been considered untreatable. Harris and Rice's ''Handbook of Psychopathy'' says that there is little evidence of a cure or effective treatment for psychopathy; no medications can instill empathy, and psychopaths who undergo traditional [[talk therapy]] might become more adept at manipulating others and more likely to commit crime.<ref name="Patrick 2006 555–572">{{Cite journal |last1=Harris|first1=Grant|last2=Rice|first2=Marnie|contribution=Treatment of psychopathy: A review of empirical findings|editor-last=Patrick|editor-first=Christopher|title= Handbook of Psychopathy|year=2006|pages=555–72|url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/85192141/2006-harris.pdf|isbn=9781593855918}}</ref> The only study finding increased criminal recidivism after treatment was in a 2011 review a retrospective study with several methodological problems on a today likely not approved treatment program in the 1960s. Some relatively rigorous quasi-experimental studies using more modern treatment methods have found improvements regarding reducing future violent and other criminal behavior, regardless of PCL-R scores, although none was a [[randomized controlled trial]]. Some other studies have found improvements in risk factors for crime such as substance abuse. No study had in a 2011 review examined if the personality traits could be changed by such treatments.<ref name=gap/> It has been shown in some studies that punishment and behavior modification techniques may not improve the behavior of psychopaths.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harris|first1=Grant|last2=Rice|first2=Marnie|contribution=Treatment of psychopathy: A review of empirical findings|editor-last=Patrick|editor-first=Christopher|title=Handbook of Psychopathy|year=2006|pages=555–572|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

===Legal response===
The PCL-R, the PCL:SV, and the PCL:YV are highly regarded and widely used in [[criminal justice]] settings in particular in North America. They may be used for risk assessment and for assessing treatment potential and be used as part of the decisions regarding bail, sentence, which prison to use, parole, and regarding whether to a youth should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult. There have been several criticisms against this. They include the general criticisms against the PCL-R, the availability of other risk assessment tools which may have advantages, and excessive pessimism regarding prognosis and treatment possibilities (see earlier sections).<ref name=gap/>

The interrater [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the PCL-R can be high when used carefully in research but tend to be poor in applied settings. In particular Factor 1 items are somewhat subjective. In sexually violent predator cases the PCL-R scores given by prosecution experts were consistently higher than those given by defense experts in one study. The scoring may also be influenced by other differences between raters. In one study it was estimated that of the PCL-R variance, about 45% was due to true offender differences, 20% was due to which side the rater testified for, and 30% was due to other rater differences.<ref name=gap/>

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]], "Psychopathic Disorder" was legally defined in the Mental Health Act (UK)<ref name=ukmha>The Mental Health Act (UK) [http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm50/5016-ii/5016ii.htm Reforming The Mental Health Act, Part II, High risk patients] Accessed June 26, 2006</ref> as, "a persistent disorder or disability of mind (whether or not including significant impairment of intelligence) which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned."  This term, which did not equate to psychopathy, was intended to reflect the presence of a personality disorder, in terms of conditions for detention under the Mental Health Act 1983. With the subsequent amendments to the Mental Health Act 1983 within the [[Mental Health Act 2007]], the term "psychopathic disorder" has been abolished, with all conditions for detention (e.g. mental illness, personality disorder, etc.) now being contained within the generic term of "mental disorder".

In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the diagnosis of [[dissocial personality disorder]] is grounds for detention in secure [[psychiatric hospital]]s under the [[Mental Health Act 1983|Mental Health Act]] if they have committed serious crimes, but since such individuals are disruptive for other patients and not responsive to treatment this alternative to [[prison]] is not often used.<ref>{{Cite book

====United States====

==== "Sexual psychopath" laws ====
Starting in the 1930s, before the modern concept of psychopathy, "sexual psychopath" laws were introduced by some states until by the mid-1960s more than half of the states had such laws. "Sexual psychopaths" were seen as a distinct group of sex offenders who were not seriously mentally ill but had a "psychopathic personality" that could be treated. This was in agreement with the general rehabilitative trends at this time. Courts sent such sex offenders to a mental health facility for community protection and treatment.<ref name="JamesThomasFoley">Nathan James, Kenneth R. Thomas, Cassandra Foley. Commitment of Sexually Dangerous Persons. July 2, 2007. Congressional Research Service. http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34068_20070702.pdf</ref>

Starting in 1970 many of these laws were modified or abolished in favor of more traditional responses such as imprisonment due to criticism of the "sexual psychopath" concept as lacking scientific evidence, the treatment being ineffective, and predictions of future offending being dubious. There were also a series of cases where persons treated and released committed new sex crimes. Starting in the 1990s several states have passed [[Sexually violent predator laws|sexually dangerous person laws]], not synonymous with the modern concept of psychopathy, which permit confinement after a sentence has been completed.<ref name="JamesThomasFoley"/> Psychopathy measurements may be used in the confinement decision process.<ref name=gap/>

==Epidemiology==
A 2008 study using the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL: SV) found that 1.2% of a US sample scored 13 or more which indicates "potential psychopathy". Over half of those studied had scores of 0 or 1 and about two-thirds scored 2 or less. Higher scores were significantly associated with more violence, higher alcohol use, and estimated  lower intelligence.<ref name=neumann1>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.76.5.893 |title=Psychopathic traits in a large community sample: Links to violence, alcohol use, and intelligence |year=2008 |last1=Neumann |first1=Craig S. |last2=Hare |first2=Robert D. |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume=76 |pages=893–9 |pmid=18837606 |issue=5|url=http://www.hare.org/references/NeumannandHareJCCP2008.pdf}}</ref>

A 2009 British study by Coid et al., also using the PCL: SV, reported a community prevalence of 0.6% scoring 13 or more. The lower prevalence than in the 2008 study may be due to the 2009 sample being more representative of the general population. The scores "correlated with: younger age, male gender; suicide attempts, violent behavior, imprisonment and homelessness; drug dependence; histrionic, borderline and adult antisocial personality disorders; panic and obsessive–compulsive disorders."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coid J, Yang M, Ullrich S, Roberts A, Hare RD |title=Prevalence and correlates of psychopathic traits in the household population of Great Britain |journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=65–73 |year=2009 |pmid=19243821 |doi=10.1016/j.ijlp.2009.01.002}}</ref>

PCL-R creator Robert Hare has stated that many (male) psychopaths have a pattern of mating with, and quickly abandoning women, and as a result, have a high [[fertility]] rate. These children may inherit a predisposition to psychopathy. Hare describes the implications as chilling.<ref name="Without Conscience" /> However, empirical evidence regarding the [[reproductive success]] of psychopaths is lacking.<ref name=gap/>

==History==
{{Main|History of psychopathy}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13774, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|180px|Walter C. Langer of Harvard University described [[Adolf Hitler]] as a "neurotic psychopath."<ref name="psycho" />]]
Psychopathy has a long history from a very general concept including many chronic conditions that gradually narrowed to the current one. Sociopathy was introduced as an alternative name indicating a belief that the causes were due to social factors. A more modern concept was introduced by Hervey Cleckley in his influential ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'' which was first published in 1941.<ref name=gap/>

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' was initially influenced by Cleckly's work but later changed the diagnostic criteria to overt antisocial behaviors in order to avoid more subjective judgements of personality traits. Robert Hare in 1980 introduced the influential "Psychopathy Checklist" (PCL) which was revised in 1991 (PCL-R). It is the most widely used measure of psychopathy. There are several self-report tests with "The Psychopathic Personality Inventory" (PPI) being the most popular.<ref name=gap/>

== Society and culture ==
Famous individuals are sometimes diagnosed, perhaps at a distance, as psychopaths. In a report prepared for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] in 1943, [[Walter Charles Langer|Walter C. Langer]] of [[Harvard University]] described [[Adolf Hitler]] as a "neurotic psychopath."<ref name="psycho" >{{cite book
