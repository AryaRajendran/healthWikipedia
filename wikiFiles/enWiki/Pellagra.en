'''Pellagra'''  is a [[vitamin]] [[deficiency disease]] most commonly caused by a chronic lack of [[niacin]] (vitamin B<sub>3</sub>) in the diet. It can be caused by decreased intake of niacin or [[tryptophan]],<ref name=Pitche_2005>{{cite journal |author=Pitche P |title=Pellagra |journal=Sante |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=205–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16207585}}</ref> and possibly by excessive intake of [[leucine]].<ref name=Bapurao_1978>{{cite journal |author=Bapurao S, Krishnaswamy K |title=Vitamin B6 nutritional status of pellagrins and their leucine tolerance |journal=Am J Clin Nutr |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=819–24 |year=1978 |pmid=206127}}</ref> It may also result from alterations in protein metabolism in disorders such as [[carcinoid syndrome]]. A deficiency of the [[amino acid]] [[lysine]] can lead to a deficiency of niacin, as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vitamins-supplements.org/amino-acids/lysine.php |title=Lysine &#124; amino acid health benefits, dietary sources, side effects |publisher=Vitamins-supplements.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref>

==History==
The traditional food preparation method of [[maize]] ("corn"), [[nixtamalization]], by native [[New World]] cultivators who had domesticated corn required treatment of the grain with [[calcium hydroxide|lime]], an [[alkali]]. The lime treatment has been shown to make niacin nutritionally available and reduce the chance of developing pellagra.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rajakumar, K |title=Pellagra in the United States: A Historical Perspective |journal=Southern Medical Journal |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=272–277 |year=2000 |issn= 00384348 |pmid=10728513}}</ref> When maize cultivation was adopted worldwide, this preparation method was not accepted because the benefit was not understood. The original cultivators, often heavily dependent on maize, did not suffer from pellagra; it became common only when maize became a staple that was eaten without the traditional treatment.

Pellagra was first described for its dermatological effect in Spain in 1735 by [[Gaspar Casal]]. He explained that the disease causes dermatitis in exposed skin areas such as hands, feet and neck and that the origin of the disease is poor diet and atmospheric influences.<ref>Casal G. The natural and medical history of the principality of the Asturias. In: Classic Descriptions of Disease (Major RH, ed.), 3rd edn. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas Publisher, 1945; 607–12.</ref> His work published in 1762 by his friend Juan Sevillano was titled ‘Historia Natural y Medicina del Principado de Asturias’ or ''Natural and Medical History of the Principality of Asturias'' (1762). This led to the disease being known as "Asturian leprosy", and it is recognized as the first modern pathological description of a syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stratigos JD, Katsambas A |title=Pellagra: a still existing disease |journal=Br.

D. (2000). "Theophile Roussel and the elimination of pellagra from 19th century France." Nutrition 16(3): 231-233.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10705082?dopt=Citation</ref> Because pellagra outbreaks occurred in regions where maize was a dominant food crop, the belief for centuries was that the maize either carried a toxic substance or was a carrier of disease. Pellagra was also conjectured to be carried by insects. Later, the lack of pellagra outbreaks in [[Mesoamerica]], where maize is a major food crop, led researchers to investigate processing techniques in that region.

Pellagra was studied mostly in Europe until the late 19th century when it became an epidemic especially in the southern United States.<ref>Sydenstricker, V. P. (1958). "The history of pellagra, its recognition as a disorder of nutrition and its conquest." Am J Clin Nutr 6(4): 409-414.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13559167?dopt=Citation</ref> In the early 1900s, pellagra reached epidemic proportions in the American South.  Between 1906 and 1940 more than 3 million Americans were affected by pellagra with more than 100,000 deaths, yet the epidemic resolved itself right after dietary niacin fortification.<ref>Bollet, A. J. (1992). "Politics and pellagra: the epidemic of pellagra in the U.S. in the early twentieth century."

At this time, the scientific community held that pellagra was probably caused by a [[Microorganism|germ]] or some unknown [[toxin]] in corn.<ref name=Bollet_1992>{{cite journal |author=Bollet A |title=Politics and pellagra: the epidemic of pellagra in the U.S. in the early twentieth century |journal=Yale J Biol Med |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=211–21 |year=1992 |pmid=1285449 |pmc=2589605}}</ref> The Spartanburg Pellagra Hospital in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], was the nation's first facility dedicated to discovering the cause of pellagra. It was established in 1914 with a special congressional appropriation to the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and set up primarily for research. In 1915, [[Joseph Goldberger]], assigned to study pellagra by the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], showed it was linked to diet by inducing the disease in prisoners, using the Spartanburg Pellagra Hospital as his clinic. By 1926, Goldberger established that a balanced diet or a small amount of [[brewer's yeast]]<ref name=Swan_2005>{{cite journal | author = Swan, Patricia | title = Goldberger's War: The Life and Work of a Public Health Crusader (review) | journal = Bulletin of the History of Medicine | year = 2005 | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 146–7 | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bulletin_of_the_history_of_medicine/v079/79.1swan.html | doi = 10.1353/bhm.2005.0046}}</ref> prevented pellagra.

Goldberger experimented on 11 prisoners. Before the experiment, the prisoners were eating fruits and vegetables from the prison garden. Goldberger started feeding them only corn. About two weeks into the experiment, the prisoners complained of headaches, confusion, and loss of appetite. In the third week, seven of the 11 broke out in pellagra, and two prisoners begged for release. Goldberger cured them, feeding them fruits and vegetables again, and gave them their freedom. In 1920’s he connected pellagra to the diet of rural areas with corn-based diets rather than infection, contrary to the common medical ideas of that time.<ref>Goldberger, J. and G. A. Wheeler (1990).

In 1937, [[Conrad Elvehjem]], of Madison, Wisconsin, showed the vitamin niacin cured pellagra (manifested as [[Black hairy tongue|black tongue]] in dogs). Later studies by Dr. [[Tom Spies]], Marion Blankenhorn, and Clark Cooper established that niacin also cured pellagra in humans, for which ''Time'' Magazine dubbed them its 1938 [[Time Person of the Year|Men of the Year]] in comprehensive science.

Research conducted between 1900 and 1950 found the number of cases of women with pellagra was consistently double the number of cases of afflicted men.<ref name=pmid637029>{{cite journal |author=Miller DF |title=Pellagra deaths in the United States |journal=Am.

Gillman and Gillman related skeletal tissue and pellagra in their research in South African Blacks. They provide some of the best evidence for skeletal manifestations of pellagra and the reaction of bone in malnutrition. They claimed radiological studies of adult pellagrins demonstrated marked [[osteoporosis]]. A negative mineral balance in pellagrins was noted, which indicated active mobilization and excretion of endogenous mineral substances, and undoubtedly impacted the turnover of bone. Extensive dental caries were present in over half of pellagra patients. In most cases, [[caries]] were associated with "severe gingival retraction, [[sepsis]], exposure of [[cementum]], and loosening of teeth".<ref>{{cite book | last = Gillman | first = Joseph | authorlink = | coauthors = Gillman, Theodore | title = Perspectives in Human Malnutrition: A Contribution to the Biology of Disease from a Clinical and Pathological Study of Chronic Malnutrition and Pellagra in the African | publisher = Grune and Stratton | year = 1951 | location = New York, New York }}</ref> Pellagra is no longer common in the United States.

==Epidemiology==
Pellagra can be common in people who obtain most of their [[food energy]] from maize ("corn" in North American English), notably rural [[South America]], where maize is a [[staple food]]. If maize is not [[Nixtamalization|nixtamalized]], it is a [[Essential amino acid#Use of essential amino acids|poor source of tryptophan]], as well as niacin. Nixtamalization corrects the niacin deficiency, and is a common practice in [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native American]] cultures that grow corn. Following the corn cycle, the symptoms usually appear during spring, increase in the summer due to greater sun exposure, and return the following spring. Indeed, pellagra was once [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in the poorer states of the U.S. South, such as Mississippi and Alabama, as well as among the residents of jails and orphanages as studied by Dr. [[Joseph Goldberger]].

Pellagra is common in Africa, Indonesia, North Korea,<ref>{{cite book|last=Harden|first=Blaine|title=Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West|year=2012|publisher=Viking Adult|isbn=0670023329}}</ref> and China. In affluent societies, a majority of patients with clinical pellagra are poor, homeless, alcohol-dependent, or psychiatric patients who refuse food.<ref name="pmid17712518">{{cite journal |author=Jagielska G, Tomaszewicz-Libudzic EC, Brzozowska A |title=Pellagra: a rare complication of anorexia nervosa |journal=Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=417–20 |year=2007 |pmid=17712518 |doi=10.1007/s00787-007-0613-4}}</ref> In other countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark, even with sufficient intake of niacin, cases have been reported. In this case deficiency might happen not just because of poverty or malnutrition but secondary to alcoholism, drug interaction (psychotropic, cytostatic, tuberclostatic or analgesics), HIV, vitamin B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>6</sub> deficiency, or malabsorption syndromes such as Hartnup and carcinoid.<ref>Hegyi, J., R.

Hartnup syndrome on the other hand reduces niacin or tryptophan absorption. Pellagra was common among prisoners of Soviet labor camps (the [[Gulag]]). It can be found in cases of chronic [[alcoholism]]. In addition, pellagra, as a micronutrient deficiency disease, frequently affects populations of refugees and other displaced people due to their unique, long-term residential circumstances and dependence on food aid. Refugees typically rely on limited sources of niacin provided to them, such as groundnuts; the instability in the nutritional content and distribution of food aid can be the cause of pellagra in displaced populations. Despite all the knowledge about pellagra, there are a few recent outbreaks in countries such as Angola, Zimbabwe and Nepal.<ref>Baquet S, Wuillaume F, Van Egmond K et al.

==Symptoms==
[[Image:Pellagra2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The dermatologic features of this disorder include [[desquamation]], [[erythema]], scaling, and [[keratosis]] of sun-exposed areas, all of which this patient had.]]
Pellagra is classically described by "the four D's": [[diarrhea]], [[dermatitis]], [[dementia]] and [[death]].<ref name=Hegyi_2004>{{cite journal |author=Hegyi J, Schwartz R, Hegyi V |title=Pellagra: dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea |journal=Int J Dermatol |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=2004 |pmid=14693013 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2004.01959.x}}</ref>
A more comprehensive list of symptoms includes:
* High [[Photodermatitis|sensitivity to sunlight]]
* [[Aggression]]
* [[Dermatitis]], [[alopecia]], [[edema]]
* Smooth, beefy red [[glossitis]]
* Red [[skin lesion]]s
* [[Insomnia]]
* [[Weakness]]
* [[Mental confusion]]
* [[Ataxia]], paralysis of extremities, peripheral neuritis
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Dilated cardiomyopathy]]
* Eventually [[dementia]]

Frostig and Spies (acc. to Cleary and Cleary) described more specific psychological symptoms of pellagra as:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cleary MJ, Cleary JP |title=Anorexia nervosa: a form of subclinical pellagra |journal=Int Clin Nutr Rev |volume=9 |issue= |pages=137–143 |year=1989 |issn=0813-9008}}</ref>
* Psychosensory disturbances (impressions as being painful, annoying bright lights, odors intolerance causing nausea and vomiting, dizziness after sudden movements)

* Psychomotor disturbances (restlessness, tense and a desire to quarrel, increased preparedness for motor action)

* Emotional disturbances
Despite clinical symptoms, blood level of tryptophan or unrinary metabolites such as 2-pyridone/N-methylniacinamide ratio <2 or NAD/NADP ratio in erythrocytes could be used to diagnose pellagra. Diagnosis could be confirmed after rapid improvements in the symptoms in patients using high doses of niacin (50–500&nbsp;mg/day) or niacin enriched food.<ref>Gehring, W. (2004). "Nicotinic acid/niacinamide and the skin." Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology
 3: 88–93.</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Pellagra can develop according to several mechanisms, all of which ultimately revolve around niacin deficiency. The first is simple dietary lack of niacin. Second, it may result from deficiency of [[tryptophan]],<ref name="Pitche_2005"/> an [[essential amino acid]] found in meat, poultry, fish, and eggs.<ref>{{cite web | author = Haas EM | title = Vitamin B3—Niacin | work = Excepted from: Staying Healthy with Nutrition: The Complete Guide to Diet and Nutritional Medicine| url = http://www.healthy.net/scr/article.asp?ID=2125 | accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> that the body [[Niacin#Biosynthesis and chemical synthesis|converts into niacin]]. Third, it may be caused by excess [[leucine]], though the relationship is unclear.<ref name="Bapurao_1978"/>

Alterations in protein metabolism may also produce pellagra-like symptoms. An example is [[carcinoid syndrome]], a disease in which [[carcinoid]] tumors produce excessive [[serotonin]]. In normal patients, only one percent of dietary tryptophan is converted to serotonin; however, in patients with carcinoid syndrome, this value may increase to 70%. The diversion of tryptophan to making serotonin in patients with metastatic tumors can result in tryptophan deficiency. Carcinoid syndrome thus may produce decreased protein synthesis, niacin deficiency, and clinical manifestations of pellagra.

==Prognosis==
Untreated, the disease can kill within four or five years. Treatment is with [[nicotinamide]], a chemical related to niacin. The frequency and amount of nicotinamide administered depends on the degree to which the condition has progressed.
