'''Biliary atresia''', also known as "extrahepatic ductopenia" and "progressive obliterative cholangiopathy" is a congenital or acquired disease of the liver and one of the principal forms of chronic rejection of a transplanted liver allograft. As a birth defect in [[neonate|newborn infants]], it has an occurrence of 1/10,000 to 1/15,000 cases in live births in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sleisenger|first=MH|title=Sleisenger and Fordtran's gastrointestinal and liver disease: pathophysiology, diagnosis, management|year=2006|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia|edition=8th Edition|coauthors=Feldman M, Friedman, LS}}</ref> In the congenital form, the common [[bile duct]] between the [[liver]] and the [[small intestine]] is blocked or absent. The acquired type most often occurs in the setting of autoimmune disease, and is one of the principal forms of chronic rejection of a transplanted liver allograft.  

Infants and children with biliary atresia have progressive cholestasis with all the usual concomitant features: jaundice, pruritus, malabsorption with growth retardation, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, hyperlipidemia, and eventually cirrhosis with portal hypertension. If unrecognized, the condition leads to [[liver failure]]—but not [[kernicterus]], as the liver is still able to conjugate bilirubin, and conjugated bilirubin is unable to cross the blood–brain barrier.  The cause of the condition is unknown.  The only effective treatments are certain surgeries such as the [[kasai procedure]], or liver transplantation.

==Symptoms and diagnosis==
Initially, the symptoms are indistinguishable from [[Jaundice#Neonatal jaundice|neonatal jaundice]], a common phenomenon. Symptoms are usually evident between one and six weeks after birth. Besides jaundice, other symptoms include clay colored stools, dark urine, swollen abdominal region and large hardened liver (which may or may not be observable by the naked eye). Prolonged jaundice that is resistant to photo therapy and/or [[exchange transfusion]]s should prompt a search for secondary causes. By this time, [[liver enzyme]]s are generally measured, and these tend to be grossly deranged, [[hyperbilirubinaemia]] is conjugated and therefore does not lead to [[kernicterus]].  [[Medical ultrasonography|Ultrasound]] investigation or other forms of imaging can confirm the diagnosis. Further testing includes radioactive scans of the liver and a [[liver biopsy]]. 

Biliary atresia seems to affect girls slightly more often than boys. Within the same family, it is common for only one child in a pair of twins or only one child within the same family to have it. Asians and African-Americans are affected more frequently than Caucasians. There does not appear to be any link to medications or immunizations given immediately before or during pregnancy.

==Pathophysiology==
There is no known cause of biliary atresia. There have been many theories about etiopathogenesis such as Reovirus 3 infection, congenital malformation, congenital CMV infection, autoimmune theory. This means that the etiology and pathogenesis of biliary atresia are largely unknown.

However, there have been extensive studies about the pathogenesis and proper management of progressive liver fibrosis, which is arguably one of the most important aspects of biliary atresia patients. As the biliary tract cannot transport bile to the intestine, [[bile]] is retained in the liver (known as stasis) and results in cirrhosis of the liver. Proliferation of the small bile ductules occur, and peribiliary fibroblasts become activated. These "reactive" biliary epithelial cells in cholestasis, unlike normal condition, produce and secrete various cytokines such as [[CCL2|CCL-2 or MCP-1]], [[Tumor necrosis factor| Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)]], [[Interleukin-6| Interleukin-6 (IL-6)]], [[Transforming growth factor-beta|TGF-beta]], [[Endothelin| Endothelin (ET)]], and [[Nitric oxide| nitric oxide (NO)]]. Among these, TGF-beta is the most important profibrogenic cytokine that can be seen in liver fibrosis in chronic cholestasis. During the chronic activation of biliary epithelium and progressive fibrosis, afflicted patients eventually show signs and symptoms of portal hypertension (esophagogastric varix bleeding, hypersplenism, hepatorenal syndrome(HRS), hepatopulmonary syndrome(HPS)). The latter two syndromes are essentially caused by systemic mediators that maintain the body within the  hyperdynamic states.

There are three main types of extrahepatic biliary atresia:
* Type I: atresia restricted to the common bile duct.
* Type II: atresia of the common hepatic duct.
* Type III: atresia of the right and left hepatic duct.

Associated anomalies include, in about 20% cases, cardiac lesions, polysplenia, situs inversus, absent vena cava and a preduodenal portal vein.

==Treatment==
If the intrahepatic biliary tree is unaffected, surgical reconstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tract is possible.  This surgery is called a [[Kasai procedure]] (after the Japanese surgeon who developed the surgery, Dr. Morio Kasai) or [[hepatoportoenterostomy]]. This procedure is not usually curative, but ideally does buy time until the child can achieve growth and undergo liver transplantation.

If the atresia is complete, [[liver transplantation]] is the only option. Timely Kasai portoenterostomy (e.g. &lt; 60 postnatal days) has shown better outcomes. Nevertheless, a considerable number of the patients, even if Kasai portoenterostomy has been successful, eventually undergo liver transplantation within a couple of years after Kasai portoenterostomy.

Recent large volume studies from Davenport et al. (Ann Surg, 2008) show that age of the patient is not an absolute clinical factor affecting the prognosis. In the latter study, influence of age differs according to the disease etiology—i.e., whether isolated BA, BASM (BA with splenic malformation ), or CBA(cystic biliary atresia). 

It is widely accepted that corticosteroid treatment after a Kasai operation, with or without choleretics and antibiotics, has a beneficial effect on the postoperative bile flow and can clear the jaundice; but the dosing and duration of the ideal steroid protocol have been controversial ("blast dose" vs. "high dose" vs. "low dose"). Furthermore, it has been observed in many retrospective longitudinal studies that steroid does not prolong survival of the native liver or transplant-free survival. Davenport et al. also showed (hepatology 2007) that short-term low-dose steroid therapy following a Kasai operation has no effect on the mid- and long-term prognosis of biliary atresia patients.

==Genetics==

A possible association with the gene [[GPC1]] which encodes a glypican 1-a heparan sulfate proteoglycan has been reported.<ref name=Cui2013>Cui S, Leyva-Vega M, Tsai EA, Eauclaire SF, Glessner JT, Hakonarson H, Devoto M, Haber BA, Spinner NB, Matthews RP (2013) Evidence from human and zebrafish that GPC1 is a biliary atresia susceptibility gene. Gastroenterology pii: S0016-5085(13)00079-6. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2013.01.022 </ref> This gene is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 2]] (2q37). This gene is involved in the regulation of the gene [[Hedgehog signaling pathway|Hedgehog]] and also of inflammation. In addition to the association of mutations in the gene and the abnormally low levels of this protein in human cases, knock out mutants in zebra fish develop similar lesions in the liver. Hedgehog inhibitors ameliorate the features in the mutated fish and the addition of hedgehog to normal fish produce lesions.

==Notable People==

{{As of|2013}},  only three individuals are known to have undergone the Kasai procedure and not have required additional surgeries. Because of the U.S. [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]], their names are not available. However,  surgeon Dr. Steven Teich of Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, performed the procedure on the second patient. The first patient underwent surgery in 1989. The second patient underwent his surgery in March 1990 at the age of three.
