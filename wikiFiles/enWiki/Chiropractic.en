Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by [[Magnet therapy|magnetic healer]], [[Daniel David Palmer|D.D. Palmer]], in [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport, Iowa, United States]].  Chiropractic theory on spinal joint dysfunction and its putative role in non-musculoskeletal disease has been a source of controversy since its inception in 1895.

Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in [[vitalism]], [[spirituality|spiritual inspiration]] and [[rationalism]]. A philosophy based on [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from [[dogma|irrefutable doctrine]] helped distinguish chiropractic from medicine, provided it with legal and political defenses against claims of practicing medicine without a license, and allowed chiropractors to establish themselves as an autonomous profession. This "straight" philosophy, taught to generations of chiropractors, rejects the [[Inference|inferential reasoning]] of the [[scientific method]],<ref name=Keating05/> and relies on deductions from [[vitalistic]] first principles rather than on the [[materialism]] of science.<ref name=Chiro-Beliefs/> 

However, most practitioners currently accept the importance of scientific research into chiropractic,<ref name=Keating05>{{cite book|author= Keating JC Jr|chapter= Philosophy in chiropractic|pages=77–98|title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic|edition=3rd|editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.)|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2005|isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref> and most practitioners are "mixers" who attempt to combine the materialistic reductionism of science with the metaphysics of their predecessors and with the [[Holistic medicine|holistic paradigm of wellness]];<ref name=Chiro-Beliefs/> a 2008 commentary proposed that chiropractic actively divorce itself from the straight philosophy as part of a campaign to eliminate [[Testability|untestable]] dogma and engage in critical thinking and evidence-based research.<ref name=Murphy-pod/>

Although a wide diversity of ideas currently exists among chiropractors,<ref name=Keating05/> they share the belief that the [[Vertebral column|spine]] and health are related in a fundamental way, and that this relationship is mediated through the nervous system.<ref>{{cite book|author= Gay RE, Nelson CF|chapter= Chiropractic philosophy|chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=altrehab.section.336|editor= Wainapel SF, Fast A (eds.)|title= Alternative Medicine and Rehabilitation: a Guide for Practitioners|year=2003|isbn=1-888799-66-8|location= New York|publisher= [[Demos Medical Publishing]]}}</ref> Chiropractors examine the [[biomechanics]], structure and function of the spine, along with its effects on the [[musculoskeletal]] and [[nervous system]]s and what they believe to be its role in health and disease.<ref name=ACA-history>{{cite web|title= History of chiropractic care|author= [[American Chiropractic Association]]|accessdate=2008-02-21|url=http://acatoday.org/level2_css.cfm?T1ID=13&T2ID=62}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>

''Straight'' chiropractors adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by D.D. and B.J. Palmer, and retain [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] definitions and [[vitalistic]] qualities. Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an "[[innate intelligence]]" exerted via the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for many diseases. Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the "secondary effects" of subluxations) to be unnecessary for chiropractic treatment. Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not "mix" other types of therapies into their practice style.<ref name=History-Primer/> 

Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and they prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon terminology (i.e. perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment, etc.). They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care. Although considered the minority group, "they have been able to transform their status as purists and heirs of the lineage into influence dramatically out of proportion to their numbers."<ref name="Kaptchuk-Eisenberg"/>

''Mixer'' chiropractors "mix" diagnostic and treatment approaches from osteopathic, medical, and chiropractic viewpoints. Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of many causes of disease, and they incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ many treatments including conventional techniques of [[physical therapy]] such as exercise, [[massage]], [[ice pack]]s, and [[moist heat]], along with [[nutritional supplements]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]], [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]], and [[biofeedback]]. Mixers tend to be open to mainstream medicine and are the majority group.<ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg>{{cite journal|journal=[[Arch Intern Med]]|year=1998|volume=158|issue=20|pages=2215–24|title=Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions|author=Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM|pmid=9818801|url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/158/20/2215|doi=10.1001/archinte.158.20.2215 }}</ref>

Although mixers are the majority group, many of them retain some belief in vertebral subluxation as shown in a 2003 survey of 1100 North American chiropractors, which found that 88% wanted to retain the term "vertebral subluxation complex", and that when asked to estimate the percent of disorders of internal organs (such as the heart, the lungs, or the stomach) that subluxation significantly contributes to, the mean response was 62%.<ref name=McDonald/> Despite this finding, a 2008 survey of 6000 American chiropractors demonstrated that most chiropractors seem to believe that a subluxation-based clinical approach may be of limited utility for addressing visceral disorders, and greatly favored non-subluxation-based clinical approaches for such conditions.<ref name=Smith&Carber>{{cite journal|journal=[[J Chiropr Human]]|year=2008|volume=15|issue=|pages=19–26|title=Survey of US Chiropractor Attitudes and Behaviors about Subluxation|author=Smith M, Carber LA|pmid=|url=http://archive.journalchirohumanities.com/Vol%2015/JChiroprHumanit2008v15-19-26.pdf|doi= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Chiropractic & Manual Therapies]]|year=2011|volume=19|issue=4|pages=|title=The prevalence of the term subluxation in North American English-Language Doctor of chiropractic programs|author=Mirtz TA, Perle SM |pmid=21682859|url=http://chiromt.com/content/19/1/14|doi=10.1186/2045-709X-19-14 }}</ref>

=== Vertebral subluxation ===
{{Main|Vertebral subluxation}}
Palmer hypothesized that vertebral joint misalignments, which he termed ''vertebral subluxations'', interfered with the body's function and its inborn (innate) ability to heal itself.<ref name=History-PPC>{{cite book|author= [[Joseph C. Keating, Jr.|Keating JC Jr]]|chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession|pages=23–64|title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic|edition=3rd|editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.)|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2005|isbn=0-07-137534-1}}</ref> D.D. Palmer repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone (health) of the end organ. D.D. Palmer, using a vitalistic approach, imbued the term ''subluxation'' with a metaphysical and [[philosophical]] meaning. He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf|format=PDF|title= D.D. Palmer's forgotten theories of chiropractic|author= Keating JC Jr|publisher= [[Association for the History of Chiropractic]]|year=1995|accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> This concept was later expanded upon by his son, B.J. Palmer and was instrumental in providing the legal basis of differentiating chiropractic medicine from conventional medicine. In 1910, D.D. Palmer theorized that the nervous system controlled health:

:"Physiologists divide nerve-fibers, which form the nerves, into two classes, afferent and efferent. Impressions are made on the peripheral afferent fiber-endings; these create sensations that are transmitted to the center of the nervous system. Efferent nerve-fibers carry impulses out from the center to their endings. Most of these go to muscles and are therefore called motor impulses; some are secretory and enter glands; a portion are inhibitory, their function being to restrain secretion. Thus, nerves carry impulses outward and sensations inward. The activity of these nerves, or rather their fibers, may become excited or allayed by impingement, the result being a modification of functionality—too much or not enough action—which is disease."<ref>{{cite book|author= Palmer DD|title= The Chiropractor's Adjuster: Text-book of the Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic for Students and Practitioners|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/45233534/s-Adjuster-1910|location=Portland, OR|publisher= Portland Printing House Co|year=1910|oclc=17205743}}</ref>

Vertebral subluxation, a core concept of traditional chiropractic, remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and a debate about whether to keep it in the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades.<ref name=Keating-subluxation/> In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, [[dogmatic]] beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community.<ref name=Keating-subluxation>{{cite journal|journal=[[Chiropr Osteopat]]|year=2005|volume=13|page=17|title=Subluxation: dogma or science?|author=Keating JC Jr, Charlton KH, Grod JP, Perle SM, Sikorski D, Winterstein JF|doi=10.1186/1746-1340-13-17|pmid=16092955|url=http://chiroandosteo.com/content/13/1/17|pmc=1208927|issue=1}}</ref> This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others have moved towards an [[evidence-based]] chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[J Chiropr Educ]]|year=2000|volume=14|issue=2|pages=71–7|title=A survey of the use of evidence-based health care in chiropractic college clinics|author=Rose KA, Adams A|url=http://www.journalchiroed.com/2000/JCEFall2000Rose.PDF|format=PDF }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[J Man Manip Ther]]|year=2006|volume=14|issue=2|pages=E14–8|title=Can chiropractors and evidence-based manual therapists work together? an opinion from a veteran chiropractor|author=Homola S|url=http://jmmtonline.com/documents/HomolaV14N2E.pdf|format=PDF }}</ref>

In 2005, the chiropractic subluxation was defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "a lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact. It is essentially a functional entity, which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity." This differs from the medical definition of subluxation as a significant structural displacement, which can be seen with static imaging techniques such as [[Radio diagnostics|X-rays]].<ref name=WHO-guidelines>{{cite journal |author= World Health Organization|year=2005|title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf|format=PDF|isbn= 92-4-159371-7|accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> 

The 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' states "X-rays can reveal neither the subluxations nor the innate intelligence associated with chiropractic philosophy, because they do not exist."<ref name=Trick-or-Treatment/> Attorney David Chapman-Smith, Secretary-General of the [[World Federation of Chiropractic]], has stated that "Medical critics have asked how there can be a subluxation if it cannot be seen on x-ray. The answer is that the chiropractic subluxation is essentially a functional entity, not structural, and is therefore no more visible on static x-ray than a limp or headache or any other functional problem."<ref>{{cite book|page=160|chapter=Principles and Goals of Chiropractic Care|title=The Chiropractic Profession: Its Education, Practice, Research and Future Directions|author=David Chapman-Smith|year=2000|publisher=NCMIC Group|isbn=1-892734-02-8}}</ref> The [[General Chiropractic Council]], the statutory regulatory body for chiropractors in the United Kingdom, states that the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex "is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gcc-uk.org/files/link_file/Guidance_on_claims_made_for_the_chiropractic_VSC_18August10.pdf| format=PDF|title=Guidance on claims made for the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex| publisher=General Chiropractic Council|accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref>

In 2005 the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] published a document, ''WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic'' that characterized chiropractic as a health profession which "emphasizes the conservative management of the neuromusculoskeletal system, without the use of medicines and surgery".<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> Nelson ''et al'' wrote, also in 2005, that one characteristic of chiropractic is a particular emphasis on the spine.<ref name=Nelson>{{cite journal|journal=Chiropr Osteopat|year=2005|volume=13|page=9|title=Chiropractic as spine care: a model for the profession|author=Nelson CF, Lawrence DJ, Triano JJ ''et al.''|doi=10.1186/1746-1340-13-9|pmid=16000175|pmc=1185558|issue=1}}</ref> In 2011 research by Yvonne Villanueva-Russell found a range of opinions among chiropractors: some believed that treatment should be confined to the spine, or back and neck pain; others vehemently disagreed. For example, while one 2009 survey of American chiropractors had found that 73% classified themselves as "back pain/musculoskeletal specialists", the label "back and neck pain specialists" was regarded by 47% of them as a ''least'' desirable description in a 2005 international survey.<ref name="V-H">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.03.038}}</ref>

{{Main|Chiropractic treatment techniques|Spinal adjustment}}
[[Spinal manipulation]], which chiropractors call "spinal adjustment" or "chiropractic adjustment", is the most common treatment used in chiropractic care.<ref name=NBCE_techniques/> Spinal manipulation is a passive manual maneuver during which a three-joint complex is taken past the normal range of movement, but not so far as to dislocate or damage the joint. Its defining factor is a dynamic thrust, which is a sudden force that causes an audible release and attempts to increase a joint's range of motion.<ref name=ACA-SMP/> 

High-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) thrusts have physiological effects that signal neural discharge from paraspinal muscle tissues, depending on duration and amplitude of the thrust are factors of the degree in paraspinal muscle spindles activation. Clinical skill in employing HVLA-SM thrusts depends on the ability of the practitioner to handle the duration and magnitude of the load.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Spine|year=2007|volume=7|issue=5|pages=583– 95|title= Response of lumbar paraspinal muscles spindles is greater to spinal manipulative loading compared with slower loading under length control|author= Pickar JG, Sung PS, Kang YM, Ge W|pmid=17905321|pmc=2075482|doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2006.10.006|url=http://www.thespinejournalonline.com/article/S1529-9430(06)00973-9/abstract }}</ref> More generally, [[spinal manipulative therapy]] (SMT) describes techniques where the hands are used to manipulate, massage, mobilize, adjust, stimulate, apply traction to, or otherwise influence the spine and related tissues.<ref name=ACA-SMP>{{cite web|url=http://acatoday.org/pdf/spinal_manipulation_policy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Spinal manipulation policy statement|author= Winkler K, Hegetschweiler-Goertz C, Jackson PS ''et al.''|accessdate=2008-05-24|year=2003|publisher= American Chiropractic Association}}</ref>

There are several schools of chiropractic adjustive techniques, although most chiropractors mix techniques from several schools. The following adjustive procedures were received by more than 10% of patients of licensed U.S. chiropractors in a 2003 survey:<ref name=NBCE_techniques/> [[Diversified technique]] (full-spine manipulation, employing various techniques), extremity adjusting, [[Activator technique]] (which uses a spring-loaded tool to deliver precise adjustments to the spine), Thompson Technique (which relies on a drop table and detailed procedural protocols), [[Clarence Gonstead#Gonstead Technique|Gonstead]] (which emphasizes evaluating the spine along with specific adjustment that avoids rotational vectors), Cox/flexion-distraction (a gentle, low-force adjusting procedure which mixes chiropractic with osteopathic principles and utilizes specialized adjusting tables with movable parts), adjustive instrument, Sacro-Occipital Technique (which models the spine as a torsion bar), [[Neuromuscular therapy|Nimmo Receptor-Tonus Technique]], [[Applied Kinesiology]] (which emphasises "muscle testing" as a diagnostic tool), and cranial.<ref>{{cite book|title=Technique Systems in Chiropractic|author=Cooperstein R, Gleberzon BJ|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=2004|isbn=0-443-07413-5|ref=TSC }}</ref> Medicine-assisted manipulation, such as [[manipulation under anesthesia]], involves sedation or local anesthetic and is done by a team that includes an [[anesthesiologist]]; a 2008 [[systematic review]] did not find enough evidence to make recommendations about its use for chronic low back pain.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dagenais S, Mayer J, Wooley JR, Haldeman S|title=Evidence-informed management of chronic low back pain with medicine-assisted manipulation|journal=Spine J|volume=8|issue=1|pages=142–9|year=2008|pmid=18164462|doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2007.09.010 }}</ref>

===Practice guidelines===
Reviews of research studies within the chiropractic community have been used to generate practice guidelines outlining standards that specify which chiropractic treatments are "legitimate" (i.e., supported by evidence) and conceivably reimbursable under [[managed care]] health payment systems.<ref name=Villanueva-Russell/> Evidence-based guidelines are supported by one end of an ideological continuum among chiropractors; the other end employs [[antiscientific]] reasoning and makes unsubstantiated claims.<ref name=History-Primer2>{{cite web|title= Chiropractic history: a primer|author= [[Joseph C.

[[Image:Daniel David Palmer.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Half-length sitting portrait of man in his fifties with large gray beard and moustache, wearing coat and vest|[[Daniel David Palmer|D.D. Palmer]]]]
Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by [[Daniel David Palmer|Daniel David (D.D.) Palmer]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. Palmer, a [[Magnetic healing|magnetic healer]], hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could cure disease.<ref name=Baer>{{cite journal|journal=Med Anthropol Q|year=1987|volume=1|issue=2|pages=176–93|title=Divergence and convergence in two systems of manual medicine: osteopathy and chiropractic in the United States|author=Baer HA|doi=10.1525/maq.1987.1.2.02a00030 }}</ref>  Although initially keeping chiropractic a family secret, in 1898 Palmer began teaching it to a few students at his new [[Palmer School of Chiropractic]]. One student, his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|Bartlett Joshua (B.J.) Palmer]], became committed to promoting chiropractic, took over the Palmer School in 1906, and rapidly expanded its enrollment.<ref name=Martin>{{cite journal|journal=Technol Cult|author=Martin SC|year=1993|volume=34|issue=4|pages=808–34|title=Chiropractic and the social context of medical technology, 1895–1925|doi=10.2307/3106416|pmid=11623404|jstor=3106416}}</ref>

However, this version was disputed by Lillard's daughter, Valdeenia Lillard Simons. She said that her father told her that he was telling jokes to a friend in the hall outside Palmer's office and Palmer, who had been reading, joined them. When Lillard reached the punch line, Palmer, laughing heartily, slapped Lillard on the back with the hand holding the heavy book he had been reading. A few days later, Lillard told Palmer that his hearing seemed better. Palmer then decided to explore manipulation as an expansion of his magnetic healing practice. Simons said "the compact was that if they can make [something of] it, then they both would share. But, it didn't happen."<ref name="Westbrooks">{{cite journal |author= Westbrooks B |year=1982 |title= The troubled legacy of Harvey Lillard: the black experience in chiropractic |journal= Chiropr Hist |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=47–53 |pmid=11611211}}</ref>

In spite of the fact that Lillard could hear well enough to tell jokes, [[B.J. Palmer]] claimed under sworn testimony that Lillard had been "thoroughly deaf".<ref name=BJPalmerTestimony>[http://www.chirobase.org/05RB/BCC/07.html B.J. Palmer's testimony in State of Wisconsin vs. S. R. Jansheski, December, 1910]</ref> Since 1895, the story of Palmer's curing a man of deafness has been a part of chiropractic tradition. Palmer's account differs significantly from what actually happened, in that, according to Lillard's daughter, his improved hearing was likely caused by an accidentally fortuitous jarring of Lillard's body and not, as claimed by D.D. Palmer, caused by a "specific" adjustment. It was after this event that Palmer began to experiment with manipulation. He also claimed that his second patient, a man with heart disease, was also cured by spinal manipulation.

Early chiropractors believed that all disease was caused by interruptions in the flow of [[innate intelligence]], a [[Vitalism|vital]] nervous energy or life force that represented God's presence in man; chiropractic leaders often invoked religious imagery and moral traditions. D.D. and B.J. both seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, which might have provided [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|legal protection under the U.S. constitution]], but decided against it partly to avoid confusion with [[Christian Science]].<ref name=Martin/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf|format=PDF|author= Palmer DD|title= D.D.

A longstanding feud between chiropractors and [[medical doctor]]s continued for decades. The AMA labeled chiropractic an "unscientific [[cult]]" in 1966,<ref name=Chiro-PH>{{cite journal|journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther|year=2008|volume=31|issue=6|pages=397–410|title= Chiropractic and public health: current state and future vision|author= Johnson C, Baird R, Dougherty PE ''et al.''|doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2008.07.001|pmid=18722194|url=http://jmptonline.org/article/PIIS0161475408001784/fulltext}}</ref> and until 1980 advised its members that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with "unscientific practitioners".<ref>{{cite journal|journal= [[Am J Public Health]]|year=1989|volume=79|issue=11|pages=1569–70|title= AMA policy on chiropractic|author= Cherkin D|pmid=2817179|pmc=1349822|doi= 10.2105/AJPH.79.11.1569-a}}</ref> This culminated in a landmark 1987 decision, ''[[Wilk v. American Medical Association|Wilk v.

In 2008 and 2009, chiropractors, including the [[British Chiropractic Association]], used [[libel]] lawsuits and threats of lawsuits against their critics.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Godlee F|title=Keep libel laws out of science|journal=BMJ|volume=339|pages=b2783|year=2009|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/jul08_4/b2783|doi=10.1136/bmj.b2783 }}</ref> However, a libel case against science writer [[Simon Singh]] ended with the BCA withdrawing its suit in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Case dropped against Simon Singh|author=Pallab Ghosh|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8621880.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2010-04-15}}</ref><ref name="Mark Henderson">{{cite news|publisher=Times Online|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article7098157.ece|title=Science writer Simon Singh wins bitter libel battle|author=Mark Henderson|location=London|date=2010-04-16}}</ref> [[Simon Singh]] was sued for [[libel]] by the [[British Chiropractic Association]] (BCA) for criticizing their activities in a column in ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name=Eden>{{cite news | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/2570744/Doctors-take-Simon-Singh-to-court.html | title = Doctors take Simon Singh to court |last=Eden |first=R | date=2008-08-16 | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2008-12-12 | location=London}}</ref> A [[preliminary hearing]] took place at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in front of [[David Eady|Justice David Eady]].

Chiropractic has had a strong salesmanship element since it was started by D.D. Palmer. His son, [[B.J. Palmer]], asserted that their chiropractic school was founded on "…a business, not a professional basis. We manufacture chiropractors. We teach them the idea and then we show them how to sell it".<ref name=pmid18670469>{{cite journal |pmid=18670469 |url=http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/121-1278/3158/ |year=2008 |month=Jul |last1=Colquhoun |first1=D |title=Doctor Who? Inappropriate use of titles by some alternative "medicine" practitioners |volume=121 |issue=1278 |pages=6–10 |issn=0028-8446 |journal=The New Zealand medical journal}}</ref> D.D. Palmer established a magnetic healing facility in Davenport, Iowa, styling himself ‘doctor’. Not everyone was convinced, as a local paper in 1894 wrote about him: "A crank on magnetism has a crazy notion hat he can cure the sick and crippled with his magnetic hands. His victims are the weak-minded, ignorant and superstitious, those foolish people who have been sick for years and have become tired of the regular physician and want health by the short-cut method…he has certainly profited by the ignorance of his victims…His increase in business shows what can be done in Davenport, even by a quack."<ref name=pmid18670469/> D.D. Palmer remarked that "Give me a simple mind that thinks along single tracts, give me 30 days to instruct him, and that individual can go forth on the highways and byways and get more sick people well than the best, most complete, all around, unlimited medical education of any medical man who ever lived."<ref name=Ernst-eval/>

In recent decades chiropractic gained legitimacy and greater acceptance by medical physicians and [[health plan]]s, and enjoyed a strong political base and sustained demand for services. However, its future seemed uncertain: as the number of practitioners grew, [[evidence-based medicine]] insisted on treatments with demonstrated value, [[managed care]] restricted payment, and competition grew from [[massage therapist]]s and other health professions. The profession responded by marketing natural products and devices more aggressively, and by reaching deeper into [[alternative medicine]] and [[primary care]].<ref name=Cooper>{{cite pmid|12669653}}</ref>

===Safety===
Chiropractic care in general is safe when employed skillfully and appropriately.<!--<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> --> Manipulation is regarded as relatively safe, but as with all therapeutic interventions, complications can arise, and it has known adverse effects, risks and contraindications.<!--<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> --> Absolute [[contraindication]]s to spinal manipulative therapy are conditions that should not be manipulated; these contraindications include [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and conditions known to result in unstable joints.<ref name=WHO-guidelines/>

Sustained chiropractic care is promoted as a preventative tool, but unnecessary manipulation could present a risk to patients. Some chiropractors are concerned by the routine unjustified claims chiropractors have made.<ref name=Ernst-eval/>

Relative contraindications are conditions where increased risk is acceptable in some situations and where low-force and soft-tissue techniques are treatments of choice; these contraindications include [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> Although most contraindications apply only to manipulation of the affected region, some neurological signs indicate referral to [[emergency medical services]]; these include sudden and severe [[headache]] or [[neck pain]] unlike that previously experienced.<ref name=CCA-CFCREAB-CPG>{{cite journal|journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc|year=2005|volume=49|issue=3|pages=158–209|title= Chiropractic clinical practice guideline: evidence-based treatment of adult neck pain not due to whiplash|author= Anderson-Peacock E, Blouin JS, Bryans R ''et al.''|url=http://jcca-online.org/ecms.ashx/PDF/2005/2005-3/Chiropracticclinicalpracticeguideline-evidence-basedtreatmentofadultneckpainnotduetowhiplash.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=17549134|pmc=1839918 }}<br/>• {{cite journal|journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc|year=2008|volume=52|issue=1|pages=7–8|title=A Clinical Practice Guideline Update from The CCA•CFCREAB-CPG|author= Anderson-Peacock E, Bryans B, Descarreaux M ''et al.''|url=http://jcca-online.org/ecms.ashx/PDF/2008/2008-1/ClinicalPracticeGuidelineUpdatefromTheCCACFCREABCPG.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=18327295|pmc=2258235 }}</ref>

===Risk-benefit===
A 2012 [[systematic review]] concluded that no accurate assessment of risk-benefit exists for cervical manipulation.<ref name=Haynes>{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice|year=2012|volume=66|issue=10|pages=940–947|title= Assessing the risk of stroke from neck manipulation: a systematic review|author= Haynes MJ, Vincent K, Fischhoff C, Bremner AP, Lanlo O, Hankey GJ.|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2012.03004.x|pmid=22994328|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2012.03004.x/full}}</ref> A 2010 systematic review stated that there is no good evidence to assume that neck manipulation is an effective treatment for any medical condition and suggested a [[precautionary principle]] in healthcare for chiropractic intervention even if a causality with [[vertebral artery dissection]] after neck manipulation were merely a remote possibility.<ref name=Ernst-death>{{cite journal|journal= Int J Clinical Practice|year=2010|volume=64|issue= 8|pages=1162–1165|title= Deaths after chiropractic: a review of published cases|author= E Ernst|pmid=20642715|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02352.x}}</ref> The same review concluded that the risk of death from manipulations to the neck outweighs the benefits.<ref name=Ernst-death/> Chiropractors have criticized this conclusion.<ref name=Ernst-response>{{cite journal|journal= Int J Clin Pract|year=2011|volume=65|issue= 1|page=106|title= Response to critiques of deaths after chiropractic|author= E Ernst|pmid=21155949|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02568.x}}</ref> 

A 2009 review evaluating maintenance chiropractic care found that spinal manipulation is routinely associated with considerable harm and no compelling evidence exists to indicate that it adequately prevents symptoms or diseases, thus the risk-benefit is not evidently favorable.<ref>{{cite journal|journal= Prev Med|year=2009|volume=49|issue=2–3|pages=99–100|title= Chiropractic maintenance treatment, a useful preventative approach?|author= Ernst E|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.05.004|pmid=19465044}}</ref>

Gleberzon ''et al.'' identify "deliberate fraud" as a notably harmful element of the chiropractic profession, finding that dubious practice techniques can translate into "outlandish billing and utilization rates".

In an article on quackery, W.T. Jarvis has stated that "Non-scientific health care (e.g., acupuncture, ayurvedic medicine, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy) is licensed by individual states. Practitioners use unscientific practices and deception on a public who, lacking complex health-care knowledge, must rely upon the trustworthiness of providers. Quackery not only harms people, it undermines the scientific enterprise and should be actively opposed by every scientist."<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1643742 |year=1992 |month=Aug |last1=Jarvis |first1=WT |title=Quackery: a national scandal |volume=38 |issue=8B Pt 2 |pages=1574–86 |issn=0009-9147 |journal=Clinical chemistry}}</ref>

No single profession "owns" spinal manipulation and there is little consensus as to which profession should administer SM, raising concerns by chiropractors that other medical physicians could "steal" SM procedures from chiropractors. A focus on evidence-based SM research has also raised concerns that the resulting practice guidelines could limit the scope of chiropractic practice to treating backs and necks.<ref name=Villanueva-Russell>{{cite journal |journal= [[Soc Sci Med]] |year=2005 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=545–61 |title= Evidence-based medicine and its implications for the profession of chiropractic |author= Villanueva-Russell Y |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.05.017 |pmid=15550303}}</ref> Two U.S. states (Washington and Arkansas) prohibit physical therapists from performing SM,<ref>{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Chantal |title=Physical therapists, chiropractors square off over bill |url=http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/politicsnorthwest/2009/01/22/the_campus_is_heating_up.html |date=2009-01-22 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref> some states allow them to do it only if they have completed advanced training in SM, and some states allow only chiropractors to perform SM, or only chiropractors and physicians.
