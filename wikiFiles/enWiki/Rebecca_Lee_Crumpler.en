Crumpler describes the progression of experiences that led her to study and practice medicine in her ''A Book of Medical Discourses'' (1883): 
<blockquote>It may be well to state here that, having been reared by a kind aunt in Pennsylvania, whose usefulness with the sick was continually sought, I early conceived a liking for, and sought every opportunity to relieve the sufferings of others. Later in life I devoted my time, when best I could, to nursing as a business, serving under different doctors for a period of eight years (from 1852 to 1860); most of the time at my adopted home in Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. From these doctors I received letters commending me to the faculty of the New England Female Medical College, whence, four years afterward, I received the degree of doctress of medicine.<ref name="NLM Biography" /><ref>{{ cite book | author=Rebecca Crumpler | title=A Book of Medical Discourses | location=Boston | publisher=Cashman, Keating | year=1883 }} {{OCLC|14773801}}</ref></blockquote>

===Career===
Crumpler first practiced medicine in [[Boston]],<ref name="NLM Biography" /> primarily for poor women and children. During this time she "sought training in the 'British Dominion'".<ref name="Gates" />  

After the [[American Civil War]] ended in 1865, she moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]] believing it to be "a proper field for real missionary work, and one that would present ample opportunities to become acquainted with the diseases of women and children. During my stay there nearly every hour was improved in that sphere of labor. The last quarter of the year 1866, I was enabled… to have access each day to a very large number of the indigent, and others of different classes, in a population of over 30,000 colored." Crumpler worked for the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] to provide medical care to freed [[slavery|slaves]]; She was subject to "intense racism": "men doctors snubbed her, druggist balked at filling her prescriptions, and some people wisecraked that the M.D. behind her name stood for nothing more than 'Mule Driver'".<ref name="NLM Biography" /><ref name="Gates" />{{#tag:ref|The great need for medical providers encouraged other black people to join the medical profession. Black charitable organizations and white missionary organizations provided funding for the first black medical schools.<ref name="Gates" />|group="nb"}}

Rebecca married Dr. Arthur Crumpler around the time of her graduation<ref name="Gates" /> but by the time she moved back to Boston. Her neighborhood on Joy Street in [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] was a predominantly African American community. She "entered into the work with renewed vigor, practicing outside, and receiving children in the house for treatment; regardless, in a measure, of remuneration."<ref name="NLM Biography" />

==Later years==
By 1880 and her husband moved to [[Hyde Park, Massachusetts]]. There was not great demand for her service in the community. She was no longer practicing medicine by 1883 when she wrote ''A Book of Medical Discourses'' from the notes she kept over the course of her medical career. It was dedicated to nurses and mothers.<ref name="NLM Biography" /><ref name="Gates" />

Crumpler died on March 9, 1895 in Fairview, Massachusetts; According to her death certificate she was still a resident of Hyde Park. Her husband, Arthur, died after Rebecca.<ref name="Gates" />
