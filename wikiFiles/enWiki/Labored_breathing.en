'''Labored respiration''' or '''labored breathing''' is an abnormal [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] characterized by evidence of increased effort to breathe, including the use of [[accessory muscles of respiration]], [[stridor]], grunting, or [[nasal flaring]].<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/labored+breathing TheFreeDictionary > labored breathing] Retrieved on Dec 12, 2009</ref>

==Classification==
Labored breathing is distinguished from [[shortness of breath]] or ''dyspnea'', which is the sensation of respiratory distress rather than a physical presentation.

</ref> simply define dyspnea as ''difficulty in breathing'' without further specification, which may confuse it with e.g. labored breathing or [[tachypnea]] (rapid breathing).<ref name=West>{{cite book |author=West JB |title=Pulmonary pathophysiology: the essentials |edition=7 |location=Baltimore |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year=2008 |pages=45}}</ref> Labored breathing has occasionally been included in the definition of dyspnea as well.<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3145 Definition of Dyspnea] MedicineNet. Last Editorial Review: 11/1/1998]</ref> However, in the standard definition, these related signs may be present at the same time, but don't necessarily have to be. For instance, in [[respiratory arrest]] by a primary failure in respiratory muscles the patient, if conscious, may experience dyspnea, yet without having any labored breathing or tachypnea. The other way around, labored breathing or tachypnea can voluntarily be performed even when there is no dyspnea.

Presentations of labored respiration include:
* [[Hyperpnea]] - faster and/or deeper breathing 
* [[Tachypnea]] - increased breathing rate
* ''Retractions'' or ''recessions'' - sucking in of the skin, around the ribs<ref name=Levene2000/> and the top of the sternum<ref>[http://www.uptodate.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=~IJIXh1W5371lMy UpToDate >Patient information: Croup in infants and children] Charles R Woods, MD, MS. Last literature review version 17.3: September 2009 </ref>
* Use of [[accessory muscles of respiration]] rather than only the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]

==Causes==
Causes of labored breathing include:
* Severe metabolic acidosis, particularly [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA) but also renal failure. The specific associated breathing pattern is called [[Kussmaul breathing]].
