==Personal life==
Richard Asher was born to the Reverend Felix Asher and his wife Louise (née Stern). He married [[Margaret Eliot|Margaret Augusta Eliot]] at St Pancras' Church, London on 27 July 1943,<ref>GRO Register of Marriages: September 1943 1b 4 Pancras - Asher = Eliot</ref> whereupon his father-in-law gave him a complete set of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which physician and medical ethicist [[Maurice Henry Pappworth|Maurice Pappworth]] alleged was the source of Asher's "accidental" reputation as a medical [[Etymology|etymologist]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lock | first = Stephen | title = The words of medicine, R.

The Asher family home above his private consulting rooms at 57 [[Wimpole Street]] was briefly notable when [[Paul McCartney]] lived there in 1964-1966 during his relationship with Jane Asher.<ref>{{cite book  | first = Graham | last = Vickers | title = Rock Music Landmarks of London | year = 2001 | publisher = Omnibus Press | isbn = 0-7119-8675-4 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZYU3euLYMAgC}}</ref>

In 1964 Asher suddenly gave up his hospital post and perhaps all medical activities.<ref name="BMJObituary" /> He suffered from depression in later life and reportedly died by his own hand at the age of 57.<ref name="Rowat2001" />

=="Seven Sins of Medicine"==
{{Main|Seven Sins of Medicine}}
The "[[Seven Sins of Medicine]]"<ref name="Rowat2001" /> is a lecture delivered by Asher and later published in ''The Lancet'', describing medical professional behaviour that is considered inappropriate. These sins are often quoted to students:
# Obscurity
# Cruelty
# Bad manners
# Over-specialisation
# Love of the rare
# Common stupidity
# Sloth

==Prize in his memory==
Since 1995 an annual prize (2010 value £1,200) in memory of Asher has been awarded by the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and the [[Society of Authors]] for the best first edition textbook aimed at undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite web
