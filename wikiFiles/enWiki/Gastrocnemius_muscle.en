In humans, the '''gastrocnemius muscle''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|ɡ|æ|s|t|r|ɒ|k|ˈ|n|iː|m|i|ə|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɡ|æ|s|t|r|ə|k|ˈ|n|iː|m|i|ə|s}}; [[Latin]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''γαστήρ'' "stomach" and ''knēmē'' "leg"; meaning "stomach of leg", referring to the bulging shape of the calf) is a very powerful superficial [[bipennate muscle]] that is in the back part of the lower leg.  It runs from its two heads just above the [[knee]] to the [[calcaneus|heel]], and is involved in standing, walking, running and jumping. Along with the [[soleus muscle]] it forms the [[triceps surae muscle|calf muscle]]. Its function is [[Plantarflexion|plantar flexing]] the foot at the ankle joint and flexing the leg at the knee joint. In a 1967 [[Electromyography|EMG]] study, Herman and Bragin concluded that its most important role was [[Anatomical terms of location#Relative directions in the limbs|plantar]] flexing in large contractions and in rapid development of tension.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Nancy |last1=Hamilton |first2=Kathryn |last2=Luttgens |title=Kinesiology: Scientific Basis of Human Motion |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |edition=10th |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-07-248910-1}}</ref>

The gastrocnemius is located with the [[soleus muscle|soleus]] in the posterior (back) compartment of the leg.  The lateral head originates from the lateral condyle of the femur, while the medial head originates from the medial condyle of the [[femur]]. Its other end forms a common tendon with the [[soleus muscle]]; this tendon is known as the calcaneal tendon or [[Achilles tendon|Achilles Tendon]] and inserts onto the posterior surface of the [[calcaneus]], or heel bone.

Deep to the gastrocnemius (farther from the skin) is the soleus muscle.  Some anatomists consider both to be a single muscle, the [[triceps surae muscle|triceps surae]] or "calf muscle", since they share a common insertion via the Achilles tendon. The [[plantaris muscle|plantaris]] muscle and a portion of its tendon run between the two muscles, which is involved in "locking" the knee from the standing position. Since the anterior compartment of the leg is lateral to the tibia, the bulge of muscle medial to the [[tibia]] on the anterior side is actually the posterior compartment. The soleus is superficial to the mid-shaft of the tibia.
Frequently there is a [[sesamoid bone]] called the "[[fabella]]" in the lateral head of gastrocnemius muscle.

==Clinical significance==
The gastrocnemius muscle is prone to [[spasm]]s, which are painful, involuntary, contractions of the muscle that may last several minutes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nighttime Leg Cramps |url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/nighttime-leg-cramps-topic-overview |publisher=[[WebMD]] |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}</ref>

A severe ankle dorsiflexion force may result in an injury of the muscle, commonly referred to as a "torn" or "strained" calf muscle, which is acutely painful and disabling.

The gastrocnemius muscle may also become [[inflammation|inflamed]] due to overuse. [[Anti-inflammatory]] medications and physical therapy (heat, massage, and stretching) may be useful.

Anatomical abnormalities involving the medial head of gastrocnemius muscle results in [[popliteal artery entrapment syndrome]].
