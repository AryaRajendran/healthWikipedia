In human anatomy, the '''extensor carpi ulnaris''' is a [[skeletal muscle]] located on the [[ulna]]r side of the [[forearm]].  It acts to extend and adduct at the [[carpus]]/wrist.

Being an extensor muscle, extensor carpi ulnaris is on the posterior side of the forearm.

==Origin and insertion==
It originates from the [[Lateral epicondyle of the humerus|lateral epicondyle]] of the [[humerus]] and the posterior border of the [[ulna]], and crosses the forearm to the [[ulna]]r (medial) side to insert at the base of the [[5th metacarpal]].

==Action==
The extensor carpi ulnaris [[Extension (kinesiology)|extends]] the [[wrist]], but when acting alone inclines the hand toward the ulnar side; by its continued action it extends the elbow-joint.

The muscle is a minor extensor of the carpus in carnivores, but has become a flexor in [[ungulate]]s. In this case it is described as ''ulnaris lateralis''.

==Innervation==
Despite its name, the extensor carpi ulnaris is innervated by the deep branch of the [[radial nerve]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Clinically oriented anatomy.|year=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wil|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-6083-1181-1|pages=751}}</ref> It would therefore be paralyzed in an injury to the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.<ref>{{cite book

==Injuries==
A common injury to the extensor carpi ulnaris is [[tennis elbow]].  This injury occurs in people that participate in activities requiring repetitive arm, elbow, and wrist, especially then they are tightly gripping an object.  Some symptoms include pain when shaking hands or squeezing an object.  The pain worsens when a person moves their wrist with force.  The pain intensifies because the extensor carpi ulnaris has an injury near the elbow area and as a person moves their arm, the muscle contracts, thus causing it to move over the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.  This causes irritation to the already existing injury.  Some treatments for tennis elbow include physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, and rest from the activity that caused the injury.<ref>{{Cite journal
