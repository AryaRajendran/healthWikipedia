'''Desiccated thyroid''' or '''thyroid extract''', refers to [[pig|porcine]] (or mixed beef and pork) [[thyroid]] glands, dried and powdered for [[medication|therapeutic]] use. Pork (or mixed beef and pork) thyroid preparations were developed in the late 19th century, and are still used today to treat [[hypothyroidism]], the condition of having an underactive thyroid gland. This product is sometimes referred to as "natural thyroid", "natural thyroid hormones", "pork thyroid", thyroid [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]], thyroid [[British Pharmacopoeia|BP]], or by the name of a commercial brand, such as "Armour Thyroid" or "Nature-Throid" & "Westhroid".

Desiccated thyroid has been described in the [[United States Pharmacopoeia]] for nearly a century as ''the cleaned, dried, and powdered thyroid gland previously deprived of connective tissue and fat... obtained from domesticated animals that are used for food by man'' (USP XVI). In the last few decades, pork alone is the usual source. Historically, before modern assays, the potency was specified only by [[iodine]] content ("not less than 0.17% and not more than 0.23%"), rather than hormonal content or activity.

Brands include Forest Lab's '''Armour''', and '''Naturethroid''' & '''Westhroid''' by RLC Labs. Also available is a new generic NP thyroid by Acella Pharmaceuticals. Canada's desiccated thyroid is made by Erfa and is called '''Thyroid'''. All consist of desiccated porcine thyroid powder, differing only in the binders and fillers.

Nature-Throid and Westhroid are available in the following strengths: 1/4(16.25 mg), 1/2(32.5 mg), 3/4(48.75 mg), 1(65 mg), 1.25(81.25 mg), 1.5(97.5 mg), 1.75(113.75), 2(130 mg), 2.25(146.25 mg), 2.5(162.5 mg), 3(195 mg), 4(260 mg), & 5(325 mg) grain. Each one grain (65 mg) contains 9 mcg of T3, and 38 mcg of T4.

All brands contain a mixture of thyroid hormones: T4 ([[thyroxine]]), T3 ([[triiodothyronine]]) in the proportions usually present in pig thyroids (approximately 80% T4 and 20% T3). Armour is made in the following strengths: 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, and 3 grain as well as 4 and 5 grain tablets. One grain (about 60&nbsp;mg) of desiccated thyroid contains about 38 mcg of T4 and 9 mcg of T3.<ref>Epocrates Essentials</ref> Because the preparation is whole thyroid gland, each 60&nbsp;mg tablet also contains over 59&nbsp;mg of all of the other constituents of pork thyroid glands.

==History==
The earliest oral treatment for hypothyroidism consisted of thyroid extract. [[George Redmayne Murray]] of the [[United Kingdom]] first described treatment of [[myxedema]] with thyroid extract in 1891, and published a description of long-term successful treatment (28 years) of a patient with myxedema (severe hypothyroidism) in 1920<ref>Murray GR. The life history of the first case of myxoedema treated by thyroid extract. ''[[Br Med J]]'' 1920;i:359-60.</ref> His treatment was quickly adopted in North America and Europe. The first recorded American use dates to 1891 by a woman who was still taking it 52 years later at 84 years of age <ref>Burgess AM. Myxedema-- controlled by thyroid extract for fifty-two years: report of a case. [[Ann Internal Med]] 1946; 25:146.</ref>

Desiccated thyroid extract is prepared from pig thyroid glands. The glands are dried (desiccated), ground to powder, combined with binder chemicals, and pressed into pills. This was a new use for parts that were previously unwanted [[slaughterhouse]] [[offal]], and [[Armour and Company]], the dominant American [[meatpacking|meatpacker]] in the 20th century, supplied the best-known brand of thyroid extract. 

Replacement by thyroid extract in hypothyroidism was one of the most effective treatments of any disease available to physicians before the middle of the 20th century, and in severe cases afforded dramatic relief of the myriad symptoms. The decision to treat was usually based on the presence of signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism because there were no accurate, readily available [[medical test|laboratory tests]] of thyroid function. Many less severe cases of hypothyroidism went untreated.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Dosage was regulated by improvement of [[symptom]]s. 

Desiccated Thyroid became a commercial treatment option in 1934 with Westhroid{{fact|date=October 2012}}, and has to this day, never been recalled for instability. In the early 1960s, desiccated thyroid hormones (thyroid extract) began to be replaced by  [[levothyroxine]] (T4), or by combinations of T4 and T3. Replacement occurred faster in the United Kingdom than in North America, but by the 1980s more patients were being prescribed levothyroxine or T4/T3 combinations than desiccated thyroid extract.

Several reasons have been identified as to why prescriptions changed from the previously-effective desiccated thyroid treatment. These factors included a desire for improved effectiveness, medical evidence, scientific theory, cultural fashion, and effective marketing. 
*Although thyroid extract was useful and usually effective, some patients continued to complain of fatigue, weight gain, or other symptoms. Dosing until the 1960s was often a matter of prolonged adjustment trials.<ref>Means JH, DeGroot LJ, Stanbury JB. The Thyroid and its Diseases. 3rd ed. New York:McGraw Hill, 1963. See chapter 9 for a lengthy discussion of the difficulties of assessing treatment in the era before effective tests, as well as the doctors' impressions of the superiority of the new synthetic thyroxine that had just become available.</ref>
*It was known that not all of the iodine content of thyroid extract was in the form of effective T4 and T3 and that actual content of available preparations varied more than the permitted 15%.<ref name="pmid13764789">{{cite journal | author = Macgregor AG | title = Why does anybody use thyroid B.P.? | journal = [[The Lancet|Lancet]] | volume = 1 | issue = 7172 | pages = 329–32 | year = 1961 | month = February | pmid = 13764789 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref><ref>Catz B, Ginsburg E, Salenger S.

*By the 1960s, it was known that thyroxine was the essential hormone produced by the thyroid gland, and that most T3 was manufactured in other parts of the body by deiodination of thyroxine. It was demonstrated in hypothyroid animals and people that replacement of thyroxine alone corrected the measurable manifestations (laboratory test results) of hypothyroidism.<ref>Braverman LE, Ingbar SH, Sterling K.

*It was discovered that a healthy person varied the amount of T3 produced from T4 in response to changing needs and conditions{{fact|date=October 2012}} and it seemed wiser not to bypass this control system by providing larger amounts of T3 than were naturally produced each day.
*Furthermore, when T3 could be measured, it was discovered that thyroid extract and synthetic combinations of T4 and T3 produced significantly greater fluctuations of T3 throughout the day than occurred in healthy people or hypothyroid people treated with thyroxine alone.<ref>Surks MI, Schadlow AR, Oppenheimer JH. A new radioimmunoassay for L-triiodothyronine: measurement in thyroid disease and in patients maintained on hormonal replacement. ''[[J Clin Invest]]'' 1972; 51:3104-13.</ref>
*[[Endocrinology|Endocrinologists]] found that treatment with thyroxine alone worked as well or better than thyroid extract for the majority of patients, although even thyroxine did not reverse all the symptoms of a minority.<ref name="pmid371874" />
*Cultural fashion and marketing played a role. In the middle of the 20th century, [[medicinal chemistry|pharmaceutical chemists]] had been discovering the active molecules in a variety of plant and animal remedies, from [[aspirin]] and [[digitoxin]] to [[vitamin]]s, and producing them synthetically with improvements in purity and dosage control. In that cultural context, it was easy to market pure levothyroxine as superior to dried animal glands.
*[[Synthroid]], one of the most successful brand names in [[pharmaceutical marketing]] history, became as synonymous with thyroid replacement to generations of American [[primary care]] doctors as [[Kleenex]] or [[Xerox]] became with their respective products.<ref>Shomon, Mary. ''Living Well With Hypothyroidism: What Your Doctor Doesn't Tell You...That You Need to Know'' (2005).</ref>

Thyroid care changed in other ways as well. Accurate T4 and T3 measurements became widely used in the 1970s, and by the late 1980s, TSH measurement had become sensitive enough to detect mild degrees of [[hyperthyroidism]] and overtreatment. To no one's surprise, blood levels of thyroid hormones and TSH were found to be the best predictors of objective benefits from thyroid replacement: those with the most severe measurable deficiency enjoyed the most dramatic and sustained benefits. It was also discovered that even mild [[hyperthyroidism]] as defined by a suppressed TSH level, whether due to disease or overtreatment, was associated with poorer [[bone density]] in women, and with higher rates of [[atrial fibrillation]] in elderly patients. Doctors began to trust the TSH measurement more and more as the index of optimal replacement dose.

As more doctors prescribed thyroxine instead of thyroid extract, the use of thyroid extract became associated with those whose medical practices deviated in many ways from standard care. (See [[complementary and alternative medicine]].) This association became a disincentive for using thyroid extract, and those prescribing it were considered to be unscientific and irrational practitioners.

==Thyroid extract proponents==
Desiccated thyroid is preferred by a growing body of patients and doctors who claim better relief of symptoms such as fatigue and depressed mood. Many proponents of desiccated thyroid feel passionately about the issue. .{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}


A number of specific claims are commonly made about thyroid extract:
*Thyroid extract is better than thyroxine because it contains both T4 and T3, and both are made by a healthy thyroid gland.
*Doses should be increased until symptoms are relieved regardless of laboratory tests.
*Other constituents of the dried thyroid glands besides the T4 and T3 (e.g., unmeasured amounts of diiodothyronine (T2), monoiodothyronine (T1), [[calcitonin]], other protein-bound iodine) may contribute to a perceived greater effectiveness or confer additional benefits.
*A product produced by [[farm]], [[slaughterhouse]], and factory is "natural", and therefore preferable to thyroxine molecules synthesized in a factory alone.

To endocrinologists the preference of some hypothyroid people for thyroid extract raises some important questions which current evidence cannot answer with certainty:
#Is the reason some people fail to have complete relief of symptoms when tests show normal levels simply because there are other causes of fatigue, depression, and weight gain and these people are mistakenly attributing the problems to the thyroid and simply enjoying a [[placebo effect]] if they claim better relief from thyroid extract?
#Does a combination of T4 and T3 provide more effective symptom relief for some people than T4 alone? Multiple controlled trials have shown inconsistent benefits of various ratios of T4 and T3.<ref>Clyde PW, Harari AE, Getka EJ, Shakir KM. Combined levothyroxine plus liothyronine compared with levothyroxine alone in primary hypothyroidism: a randomized controlled trial.

American Association of Clnical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. 2002, amended 2006.</ref> Even if most people with hypothyroidism enjoy complete relief of symptoms with thyroxine alone, are there people who need T3 as well because they cannot generate normal amounts from T4 as most people do?
#Is the perceived benefit simply a result of overtreatment, such that the same relief could be achieved by pushing a thyroxine dose to higher levels?
#Is the TSH measurement, and its associated 'normal' range, the best indicator of optimal replacement dose? Most research evidence suggests it is, but some patients feel better at doses which produce abnormally high blood levels of T4 and T3 and suppressed TSH. Is this simply a stimulant effect of high doses, similar to [[caffeine]] or [[amphetamine]]? How high is the risk of prolonged overtreatment to the [[bone]]s, [[heart]], and other parts of the body, and is it worth an improvement in subjective well-being?

Despite claims of proponents that desiccated thyroid pills are superior to thyroxine or combinations of T4 and T3 for most people with hypothyroidism, no controlled [[clinical trials]] have been published, and many physicians remain unconvinced that the superiority is anything other than a placebo effect or an overtreatment effect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Current status of thyroid extract use==
At present, a large majority of people (at least in the English-speaking world) of all ages with hypothyroidism are being treated with levothyroxine. When their blood levels of thyroid hormones and TSH are most normal, the majority have no more signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism than similar members of the population.  The [[Royal College of Physicians]] has recommended the exclusive use of synthetic levothyroxine for the treatment of hypothyroidism.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Thyroid disorders 'misdiagnosed' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7965417.stm |journal=BBC News|accessdate=2009-03-30 |quote=the only accurate way to diagnose a thyroid disorder is via a blood test which measures hormone levels, and the only scientifically proven way of treating the condition is by topping up a patient's natural thyroxine levels with a synthetic form of the hormone.
