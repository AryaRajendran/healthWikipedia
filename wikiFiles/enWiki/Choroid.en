The '''choroid''', also known as the '''choroidea''' or '''choroid coat''', is the [[Blood vessel|vascular]] layer of the eye, containing [[connective tissue]], and lying between the [[retina]] and the [[sclera]].  The human choroid is thickest at the far extreme rear of the eye (at 0.2&nbsp;mm), while in the outlying areas it narrows to 0.1&nbsp;mm.<ref name="choroid">[http://www.mrcophth.com/MRCOphth/saqpart12004/SAQ2004answer6.html MRCOphth Sacs questions]</ref> The choroid provides [[oxygen]] and nourishment to the outer layers of the [[retina]].  Along with the [[ciliary body]] and [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], the choroid forms the [[uvea (anatomy)|uveal tract]]. 
	
The structure of the choroid is generally divided into four layers: 
*Haller's layer - outermost layer of the choroid consisting of larger diameter blood vessels;<ref name="choroid"/>
*[[Sattler's layer]] - layer of medium diameter blood vessels;<ref name="choroid"/>
*[[Capillary lamina of choroid|Choriocapillaris]] - layer of capillaries;<ref name="choroid"/> and
*[[Bruch's membrane]] (synonyms: Lamina basalis, Complexus basalis, Lamina vitra) - innermost layer of the choroid.<ref name="choroid"/>

== Blood supply ==
There are two circulations of the eye:  the retinal and uveal, supplied in humans by [[Ciliary arteries|posterior ciliary arteries]], originating from the [[ophthalmic artery]].  The arteries of the uveal circulation, supplying the uvea and outer and middle layers of the retina, are branches of the ophthalmic artery and enter the eyeball without passing with the optic nerve.  The retinal circulation, on the other hand, derives its circulation from the central retinal artery, also a branch of the ophthalmic artery, but passing in conjunction with the optic nerve.<ref name="eb">"Sensory Reception:  Human Vision: Structure and function of the Human Eye" vol. 27, p. 174  Encyclopaedia Britannica,  1987</ref>  They are branching in a segmental distribution to the end arterioles and not [[anastomoses]]. This is clinically significant for diseases affecting  choroidal blood supply. The [[macula]] responsible for central vision and  the anterior part of the [[optic nerve]] are dependent on choroidal blood supply.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bjo.59.11.631 | last1 = Hayreh | first1 = SS. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1975 | month = Nov | title = Segmental nature of the choroidal vasculature | url = | journal = Br J Ophthalmol | volume = 59 | issue = 11| pages = 631â€“48 | pmid = 812547 | pmc = 1017426 }}</ref>

===In bony fish===
[[Teleosts]] bear a body of capillary adjacent to the optic nerve called the choroidal gland. Though its function is not known, it is believed to be a supplemental oxygen carrier.<ref>"Eye (Vertebrate)" McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, vol. 6, 2007.</ref>

==Mechanism==
[[Melanin]], a darkly colored [[pigment]], helps the choroid limit uncontrolled reflection within the eye that would potentially result in the perception of confusing images. In humans and most other [[primates]], melanin occurs throughout the choroid.  In [[albino]] humans, frequently melanin is absent and [[low vision|vision is low]].  In many animals, however, the partial absence of melanin contributes to superior [[night vision]].  In these animals, melanin is absent from a section of the choroid and within that section a layer of highly reflective tissue, the [[tapetum lucidum]], helps to collect light by reflecting it in a controlled manner.  The uncontrolled reflection of light from dark choroid produces the photographic [[red-eye effect]] on photos, whereas the controlled reflection of light from the tapetum lucidum produces [[eyeshine]] (see [[Tapetum lucidum]]).
