'''Glutaric acidemia type 2''' is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[metabolic disorder]] that is characterised by defects in the ability of the body to use [[protein]]s and [[fat]]s for energy.  Incompletely processed proteins and fats can build up, leading to a dangerous chemical imbalance called [[acidosis]]. 

==Diagnosis==

Glutaric acidemia type 2 often appears in infancy as a sudden metabolic crisis, in which acidosis and low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]) cause weakness, behavior changes, and vomiting. There may also be enlargement of the [[liver]], [[heart failure]], and a characteristic odor resembling that of sweaty feet. Some infants with glutaric acidemia type 2 have birth defects, including multiple fluid-filled growths in the kidneys ([[polycystic kidneys]]). Glutaric acidemia type 2 is a very rare disorder. Its precise incidence is unknown. It has been reported in several different ethnic groups.

==Genetics==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Glutaric acidemia type 2 has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

Mutations in the ''[[ETFA]]'', ''[[ETFB]]'', and ''[[ETFDH]]'' [[gene]]s cause glutaric acidemia type II. Glutaric acidemia type 2 is caused by a deficiency in either of two enzymes, called electron transfer flavoprotein and electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase. These enzymes are normally active in the [[mitochondria]], which are the energy-producing centers of cells. When one of these enzymes is defective or missing, partially broken-down nutrients accumulate in the cells and damage them, causing the signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type II.

This condition is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the gene - one from each parent - are needed to inherit the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are [[Genetic carrier|carriers]] of one copy of the defective gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder themselves.
