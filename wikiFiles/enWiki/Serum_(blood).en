In [[blood]], the '''serum''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|s|ɪər|əm}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|s|ɪr|əm}}) is the component that is neither a [[blood cell]] (serum does not contain white or red blood cells) nor a [[clotting factor]]; it is the [[blood plasma]] with the [[fibrinogen]]s removed. Serum includes all [[protein]]s not used in [[blood clotting]] (coagulation) and all the [[electrolyte]]s, [[antibodies]], [[antigen]]s, [[hormone]]s, and any [[exogenous]] substances (e.g., [[drug]]s and [[microorganism]]s).

A study of serum is [[serology]], and may also include [[proteomics]]. Serum is used in numerous [[diagnostic test]]s, as well as in [[blood typing]].

[[Blood]] is [[centrifuge]]d to remove cellular components. Anti-coagulated [[blood]] yields [[Blood plasma|plasma]] containing [[fibrinogen]] and [[clotting factor]]s. Coagulated [[blood]] (clotted blood) yields serum without [[fibrinogen]], although some clotting factors remain.

Serum is an essential factor for the self-renewal of [[embryonic stem cells]] in combination with the cytokine [[leukemia inhibitory factor]].
