'''2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo''-p-''dioxin''' ('''TCDD''') is a [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|polychlorinated dibenzo''-p-''dioxin]] (sometimes in short but inaccurately also called dioxin) with a [[chemical formula]] {{chem|C|12|H|4|Cl|4|O|2}}. TCDD is a colorless solid with no distinguishable odor at room temperature. It is usually formed as a side product in [[organic synthesis]] and [[burning]].

TCDD is the most potent compound ([[Congener (chemistry)|congener]]) of its series (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, known as PCDDs or simply dioxins) and became known as a contaminant in [[Agent Orange]], a herbicide used in the Vietnam War,<ref name=Schecter>{{cite journal |author=Schecter A, Birnbaum L, Ryan JJ, Constable JD |title=Dioxins: an overview |journal=Environ.

==Health effects==

The Expert Group of the World Health Organization considered developmental toxicity as the most pertinent risk of dioxins to human beings.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Consultation on assessment of the health risk of dioxins: re-evaluation of the tolerable daily intake (TDI): Executive summary|journal= Food Additives & Contaminants|volume=17|year=2000|pages=223–240|doi=10.1080/713810655|pmid=10912238}}</ref> Because people are usually exposed simultaneously to a number of dioxin-like chemicals, a more detailed account is given at [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]].

===Cancer===

TCDD was classified in 1997 by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] as a [[carcinogen]] for humans ([[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|group 1]]).<ref name=IARC>{{cite book |author=International Agency for Research on Cancer |title=Polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans |publisher=IARC |location=Lyon |year=1997 |isbn=92-832-1269-X |url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol69/index.php |volume=69 |series=Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans}}</ref> In the occupational cohort studies available for the classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable.<ref name="xl" /><ref name=Schwarz/> Therefore human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations.<ref name=IARC/> This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cole P, Trichopoulos D, Pastides H, Starr T, Mandel JS |title=Dioxin and cancer: a critical review |journal=Regul.

There is also direct epidemiological evidence that TCDD is not carcinogenic at low doses, and in some studies cancer risk has even decreased.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ijc.11635|author=J.T.

==Mechanism of action==
TCDD and dioxin-like compounds act via a specific receptor present in all cells: the [[aryl hydrocarbon receptor|aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/026520300283333|author=L. Poellinger.

A review. |journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology |volume=31|issue=4|year=2010|pages=452–478|pmid=20624415}}</ref> This receptor is a [[transcription factor]] which is involved in [[gene expression|expression]] of [[gene]]s; in fact it has been shown that high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tijet, N., Boutros, P.

TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as [[benzo(a)pyrene]].<ref name=Okey>{{cite journal |author=Okey AB |title=An aryl hydrocarbon receptor odyssey to the shores of toxicology: the Deichmann Lecture, International Congress of Toxicology-XI |journal=Toxicol. Sci. |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=5–38 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17569696 |doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfm096 |url=http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17569696}}</ref> 

These polycyclic hydrocarbons also activate the AH receptor, but less than TCDD and only temporarily.<ref name=Okey/> Even many natural compounds present in vegetables cause some activation of the AH receptor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mandlekar S, Hong JL, Kong AN |title=Modulation of metabolic enzymes by dietary phytochemicals: a review of mechanisms underlying beneficial versus unfavorable effects |journal=Curr. Drug Metab. |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=661–75 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16918318 |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/56425/article}}</ref> This phenomenon can be viewed as adaptive and beneficial, because it protects the organism from toxic and carcinogenic substances. Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH receptor, however, leads to a multitude of adverse effects.<ref name=Okey/>

Scientists have searched for the physiological functions of the AH receptor for years, and one obvious function is to increase the activity of enzymes breaking down foreign chemicals or normal chemicals of the body as needed. There may be other functions, however, related to growth of various organs or other regulatory functions. The AH receptor is phylogenetically highly conserved transcription factor with a history of at least 500 million years, and found in all vertebrates, and its ancient analogs are important regulatory proteins even in more primitive species.<ref name=Linden/> In fact, knock-out animals with no AH receptor are quite sick and develop poorly.<ref name=Linden/> All this implies that a certain level of AH receptor activation is physiological and necessary for the body. 

TCDD is not [[mutagenic]] and not directly [[genotoxic]].<ref name=Dragan>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/026520300283360|author=Y.P. Dragan, D.

TCDD has never been produced commercially except as a pure chemical for scientific research. It is, however, formed as a synthesis side product when producing certain [[chlorophenol]]s or [[phenoxy herbicides|chlorophenoxy acid herbicides]].<ref name="xl">{{cite doi|10.1016/0140-6736(91)91898-5}}</ref> It may also be formed along with other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofuranes in any burning, especially if certain metal [[catalyst]]s such as copper are present (see [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]]).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1021/es00003a015}}</ref>

===Cancer===

Cancers can be induced in animals at many sites. At sufficiently high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, and this has long been a basis for risk assessment.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0041-008X(78)90075-3|author=R.J.

TCDD may in some conditions potentiate the carcinogenic effects of other compounds. An example is [[benzo(a)pyrene]] that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly detoxified by conjugation, but some molecules may escape to the nucleus of the cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases the activity of oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.<ref>{{cite book |first1=H.C. |last1=Pitot III |first2=Y.P. |last2=Dragan |chapter=Chemical carcinogenesis |editor-first=C.D. |editor-last=Klaassen |title=Casarett & Doull's Toxicology: the basic science of poisons |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=0-07-134721-6 |pages=201–267 |edition=6th |url=}}</ref>

==Notable cases==
[[File:Viktor Yuschenko.jpg|thumb|[[Viktor Yushchenko]] with chloracne after his TCDD poisoning incident]]
There have been a number of accidents where people have been exposed to high doses of dioxin-like chemicals, but there are three historical cases of poisoning where the exposure has been to TCDD itself.

*In 1976, thousands of inhabitants of [[Seveso]], Italy were exposed to TCDD after an [[Seveso disaster|accidental release]] of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of [[chloracne]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/15287399109531490|author=P.

*In [[Vienna]], two women were poisoned at their workplace in 1998, and the measured concentrations in one of them were the highest ever measured in a human being, 144,000 pg/g of fat. This is about one hundred thousandfold compared with TCDD concentrations in most people today, and about ten thousandfold compared with the sum of all dioxin-like compounds in young people today. She survived but suffered from difficult chloracne for several years. Aside from malaise and [[amenorrhea]] there were surprisingly few other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1289/ehp.01109865|author=A. Geusau, K. Abraham, K.

*In 2004, then-presidential candidate [[Viktor Yushchenko]] of [[Ukraine]] was poisoned with a large dose of TCDD.
