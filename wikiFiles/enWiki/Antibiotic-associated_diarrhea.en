'''Antibiotic-associated diarrhea''' (AAD) results from an imbalance in the [[gut flora|colonic microbiota]] caused by [[antibiotic]] therapy. Microbiota alteration changes [[carbohydrate metabolism]] with decreased [[short-chain fatty acid]] absorption and an [[diarrhea|osmotic diarrhea]] as a result. Another consequence of antibiotic therapy leading to diarrhea is overgrowth of potentially [[pathogenic]] organisms such as ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''. It is defined as frequent loose and watery [[human feces|stools]] with no other complications.<ref name="HN">{{cite book|title=Harwood-Nuss' Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine|editor=Allan B.

[[Meta-analyses]] have concluded that [[probiotics]] may protect against antibiotic-associated diarrhea in both children and adults.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hempel|first=S|coauthors=Newberry, SJ; Maher, AR; Wang, Z; Miles, JN; Shanman, R; Johnsen, B; Shekelle, PG|title=Probiotics for the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2012 May 9|volume=307|issue=18|pages=1959–69|pmid=22570464|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.3507}}</ref> Evidence is insufficient however regarding an effort on rates of ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pillai|first=A|coauthors=Nelson, R|title=Probiotics for treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated colitis in adults.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2008 Jan 23|issue=1|pages=CD004611|pmid=18254055|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004611.pub2}}</ref> 

However, citing conflicting data in the studies, other sources claim that the use of probiotics has failed thus far to meet the standard of medical care required for [[evidence-based medicine]].<ref name="pmid17278265">{{Cite pmid|17278265}}</ref><ref name ="pmid17266694">{{Cite pmid|17266694}}</ref><ref name ="Sartor">Sartor RS.

Efficacy of probiotic AAD prevention is dependent on the probiotic strain(s) used and on the dosage.<ref name="pmid18542041">{{Cite pmid|18542041}}</ref><ref name="pmid18545161">{{Cite pmid|18545161}}</ref> Up to a 50% reduction of AAD occurrence has been found.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sazawal|first=S|coauthors=Hiremath, G; Dhingra, U; Malik, P; Deb, S; Black, RE|title=Efficacy of probiotics in prevention of acute diarrhoea: a meta-analysis of masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trials.|journal=The Lancet infectious diseases|date=2006 Jun|volume=6|issue=6|pages=374–82|pmid=16728323|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70495-9}}</ref> No [[side-effects]] have been reported in any of these studies. Caution should, however, be exercised when administering probiotic supplements to [[immunocompromised]] individuals or patients who have a compromised [[Leaky gut|intestinal barrier]].

''[[Clostridium difficile]]'', also known more commonly as ''C. diff'', is known to account for 10 to 20 percent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea cases. The reasoning for this, is that the antibiotics administered for the treatment of certain diseases processes such as [[inflammatory colitis]] also inadvertently kills a large portion of the [[gut flora]], the [[normal flora]] that is usually present within the [[bowel]]. With this lower amount of "healthy" bacteria present, the overgrowth of ''C. diff'' is then responsible "for elaborating the [[enterotoxin]]." <ref name="HN"/>
