The '''[[bursae]] of the [[knee]]''' are the fluid sacs and synovial pockets that surround and sometimes communicate with the [[Articular capsule of the knee joint|joint cavity]].  Thin-walled and filled with [[synovial fluid]], they represent the weak point of the joint, but also produce enlargements to the joint space.<ref>Platzer (2004), p 26</ref>  They can be grouped into either ''communicating'' and ''non-communicating'' bursae or, as below, after location.

==Frontal== <!--suprapatellar bursa redirects here-->
In front there are five bursae:
# the '''suprapatellar bursa''' or '''recess''' between the anterior surface of the lower part of the femur and the deep surface of the [[Quadriceps femoris muscle|quadriceps femoris]].<ref name="Burgener-390">Burgener (2002), p 390</ref>  It allows for movement of the quadriceps tendon over the distal end of the femur
# the '''[[prepatellar bursa]]''' between the [[patella]] and the [[skin]], results in "housemaid's knee" when inflamed.<ref name="Burgener-390" />  It allows movement of the skin over the underlying patella.<ref name="Cipriano-358">Cipriano (2002), p 358.  (A brief description of the "clinically important bursae in the anterior aspect of the knee")</ref>
# the '''deep infrapatellar bursa''' between the upper part of the tibia and the patellar ligament.<ref name="Burgener-390" />  It allows for movement of the patellar ligament over the tibia.<ref name="Cipriano-358" />
# the '''subcutaneous [or superficial] infrapatellar bursa''' between the patellar ligament and skin.<ref name="Burgener-390" />
# the '''pretibial bursa''' between the [[Tuberosity of the tibia|tibial tuberosity]] and the skin.<ref name="Burgener-390" />  It allows for movement of the skin over the tibial tuberosity.<ref name="Cipriano-358" /><!--- Cipriano actually attributes this to the "superficial infrapatellar", but not even the image on that page agrees with this; it most by a typo. --->

== Lateral ==
Laterally there are four burs√¶:<ref name="Burgener-390" />
# the '''lateral gastrocnemius [subtendinous] bursa''' between the lateral head of the [[Gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]] and the joint capsule
# the '''fibular bursa''' between the [[Lateral collateral ligament|lateral (fibular) collateral ligament]] and the tendon of the [[Biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]]
# the '''fibulopopliteal bursa''' between the fibular collateral ligament and the tendon of the [[Popliteus muscle|popliteus]]
# and the '''subpopliteal recess''' (or '''bursa''') between the tendon of the popliteus and the [[lateral condyle of the femur]]

== Medial ==
Medially, there are five bursae:
# the '''medial gastrocnemius [subtendinous] bursa''' between the medial head of the [[Gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]] and the joint capsule<ref name="Burgener-390" />
# the '''anserine bursa''' between the [[Medial collateral ligament|medial (tibial) collateral ligament]] and the tendons of the [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]], [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]], and [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]] (i.e. the [[pes anserinus]])<ref name="Burgener-390" />
# the '''bursa semimembranosa''' between the medial collateral ligament and the tendon of the [[Semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]]<ref name="Burgener-390" />
# there is one between the tendon of the semimembranosus and the [[head of the tibia]]<ref name="Grays1918">''Gray's Anatomy'' (1918)</ref>
# and occasionally there is a bursa between the tendons of the semimembranosus and semitendinosus<ref name="Grays1918" />
