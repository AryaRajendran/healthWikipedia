A '''self-inflicted wound''' ('''SIW'''), is the act of harming oneself where there are no underlying psychological problems related to the [[self-injury]], but where the injurer wanted to take advantage of being injured.

==Reasons to self-wound==

Most self-inflicted wounds occur during [[war]]time, for various possible reasons.

Potential [[compulsory draft|draftee]]s may self-injure in order to avoid being drafted for [[health]] reasons.

The most common reason enlisted soldiers self-wound is to render themselves unable to continue serving in combat, thus resulting in their removal from the combat line to a hospital. Thus, self-injury can be used to avoid a more serious combat injury or a combat death.

In prisons and forced labour camps people sometimes self-injure so that they will not be forced to work and could spend some time in the more comfortable conditions of the [[wikt:infirmary|infirmary]] [[barracks]].

==Types of wounds==

Among the most common type of wounds are a [[rifle]] shot to the hand, arm, leg, or foot.

Wounds can also occur by deliberate neglect of health, e.g. by failing to treat a minor wound that will become infected, or "forgetting" foot care in damp conditions that lead to fungal infections.

==Punishments==

In most militaries, deliberately self-inflicted wounds are considered to be a serious military offense. Most self-inflicted wounds go unnoticed, though consequences are often severe if caught.

In the [[British army]] during [[World War I]], the penalty for self-inflicted wound was [[capital punishment]], which at that time was death by firing squad. In the British Army, some 3,894 men were found guilty, though none were executed but instead were sent to prison for lengthy periods.<ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/siw.htm First World War.com - Encyclopedia - Self-inflicted Wounds (SIW)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=Spartacus>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWblighty.htm Blighty Wounds<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In [[Nazi concentration camp]]s, self-injury was dangerous as the incapacitated were often just executed, but in some lower-stringency camps it has indeed been documented.

==History==

There have been many reports of SIW during [[World War I]], placing certain soldiers under suspicion for some injuries which could have been genuine accidents.<ref name=Spartacus />

During [[World War II]], almost all armies (most often mentioned are the [[Soviet Army]] and the [[Wehrmacht]]) had cases of self-inflicted injury.
