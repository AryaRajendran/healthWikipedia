'''Fungal pneumonia''' is an [[infection]] of the [[lung]]s by [[fungus|fungi]]. It can be caused by either [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] or [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic]] fungi or a combination of both. Case mortality in fungal pneumonias can be as high as 90% in [[immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] patients,<ref name="Meersemann">{{cite journal |author=Meersseman W, Lagrou K, Maertens J, Van Wijngaerden E |title=Invasive aspergillosis in the intensive care unit |journal=Clin.

==Cause==
Specific instances of fungal infections that can manifest with pulmonary involvement include:

*[[histoplasmosis]], which has primary pulmonary lesions and hematogenous dissemination
*[[coccidioidomycosis]], which begins with an often self-limited respiratory infection (also called "Valley fever" or "San Joaquin fever")
*pulmonary [[blastomycosis]]
*[[pneumocystis pneumonia]], which typically occurs in immunocompromised people, especially [[AIDS]]
*[[sporotrichosis]] — primarily a lymphocutaneous disease, but can involve the lungs as well
*[[cryptococcosis]] — contracted through inhalation of soil contaminated with the yeast, it can manifest as a pulmonary infection and as a disseminated one
*[[aspergillosis]], resulting in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis
*rarely, [[candidiasis]] has pulmonary manifestations in immunocompromised patients.
* Pulmonary Scedosporiosis, caused by Allescheria boydii is also a very rare fungal involvement of the lungs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Meshram|first=Sushant|coauthors=Mishra Gyanshankar|title=Pulmonary scedosporiosis–A rare entity|journal=Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Disease|year=2011|month=December|volume=1|issue=4|pages=330–332|doi=10.1016/S2222-1808(11)60076-5 |url=http://www.apjtcm.com/zz/2011.4/17.pdf|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Fungi typically enter the lung with inhalation of their [[spore]]s, though they can reach the lung through the bloodstream if other parts of the body are infected. Also, fungal pneumonia can be caused by reactivation of a latent infection. Once inside the alveoli, [[fungus|fungi]] travel into the spaces between the cells and also between adjacent alveoli through connecting pores. This invasion triggers the [[immune system]] to respond by sending white blood cells responsible for attacking microorganisms ([[neutrophil]]s) to the lungs. The neutrophils [[phagocytosis|engulf]] and kill the offending organisms but also release cytokines which result in a general activation of the immune system. This results in the '''fever''', '''chills''', and '''fatigue''' common in bacterial and fungal pneumonia. The neutrophils and fluid leaked from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli and result in impaired oxygen transportation.

==Diagnosis==

Fungal pneumonia can be diagnosed in a number of ways. The simplest and cheapest method is to culture the fungus from a patient's respiratory fluids.  However, such tests are not only insensitive but take time to develop which is a major drawback because studies have shown that slow diagnosis of fungal pneumonia is linked to high mortality.<ref name="Morell 2006">{{cite journal |author=Morrell M, Fraser VJ, Kollef MH |title=Delaying the empiric treatment of candida bloodstream infection until positive blood culture results are obtained: a potential risk factor for hospital mortality |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=3640–5 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16127033 |pmc=1195428 |doi=10.1128/AAC.49.9.3640-3645.2005 }}</ref> Microscopy is another method but is also slow and imprecise. Supplementing these classical methods is the detection of [[antigen]]s.  This technique is significantly faster but can be less sensitive and specific than the classical methods.<ref name="webinar">{{cite web |author=Denning, D |title=Webinar on fungal diagnostics |date=September 2008 |format=PDF |url=http://www.myconostica.co.uk/files/myconostica_webinar_presentation_18_sep_2008.pdf}}</ref>

A molecular test based on [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|real-time PCR]] is also available from Myconostica. Relying on [[DNA]] detection, this is the most sensitive and specific test available for fungi but it is presently limited to detecting only pneumocystis jirovecii and aspergillus.<ref name="unpublished">, Philippe Hauser,

==Treatment==
Fungal pneumonia can be treated with [[antifungal drug]]s and sometimes by [[Debridement|surgical debridement]].
