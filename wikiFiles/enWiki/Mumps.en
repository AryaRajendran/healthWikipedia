'''Mumps'''  ('''epidemic [[parotitis]]''') is a [[viral disease]] of the [[human]] species, caused by the [[mumps virus]]. Before the development of [[vaccination]] and the introduction of a  [[mumps vaccine|vaccine]], it was a common [[childhood disease]] worldwide. It is still a significant threat to health in [[developing countries]], and outbreaks still occur sporadically in [[developed countries]].<ref name=Harrison>{{cite book | author = Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Jameson JL, Isselbacher KJ, Eds. | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine | edition = 16th | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-07-140235-7 }}</ref>

Other symptoms of mumps can include dry mouth, sore face and/or ears and occasionally in more serious cases, loss of voice. In addition, up to 20% of persons infected with the mumps virus do not show symptoms, so it is possible to be infected and spread the virus without knowing it.<ref>{{Citation |year=2008 |month=December |title=FAQ For Young Adults |at=Could I be infected with mumps without knowing it? |publisher=Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care |url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/cs/mumps/english/faq/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090426040001/http://www.health.gov.on.ca/cs/mumps/english/faq/ |archivedate=April 26, 2009 }}</ref>

== Cause==
Mumps is a contagious disease that is spread from person to person through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva from an infected person. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets aerosolize and can enter the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person. Mumps can also be spread by sharing food and drinks. The virus can also survive on surfaces and then be spread after contact in a similar manner.

A person infected with mumps is contagious from approximately 6 days before the onset of symptoms until about 9 days after symptoms start.<ref>{{Citation |publication-date=January 11, 2011 |title=Mumps - Symptoms |work=NHS Choices |publisher=[[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] |publication-place=England |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Mumps/Pages/Symptoms.aspx?url=Pages/What-is-it.aspx |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/13/10/1617.htm Letter:Compliance with Exclusion Requirements to Prevent Mumps Transmission], By Stephanie M. Borchardt, Preethi Rao, and Mark S.

==Diagnosis==
A physical examination confirms the presence of the swollen glands. Usually, the disease is diagnosed on clinical grounds, and no confirmatory laboratory testing is needed. If there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, a test of saliva or [[serology|blood]] may be carried out; a newer diagnostic confirmation, using real-time [[nested polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technology, has also been developed.<ref>

==Prevention==
The most common preventative measure against mumps is a vaccination with a [[mumps vaccine]], invented by American microbiologist [[Maurice Hilleman]] at [[Merck & Co.|Merck]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Offit PA |title=Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian |isbn=0-06-122796-X |year=2007 }}</ref> The vaccine may be given separately or as part of the [[MMR vaccine|MMR immunization]] vaccine which also protects against [[measles]] and [[rubella]]. In the US, MMR is now being supplanted by [[MMRV vaccine|MMRV]], which adds protection against [[chickenpox]]. The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] (World Health Organization) recommends the use of mumps vaccines in all countries with well-functioning childhood vaccination programmes. In the United Kingdom it is routinely given to children at age 13 months with a booster at 3–5 years(preschool) This confers lifelong immunity. The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends the routine administration of MMR vaccine at ages 12–15 months and at 4–6 years.<ref>{{Citation

Because of the outbreaks within college and university settings, many governments have established vaccination programs to prevent large-scale outbreaks. In Canada, provincial governments and the Public Health Agency of Canada have all participated in awareness campaigns to encourage students ranging from grade 1 to college and university to get vaccinated.<ref>[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/mumps-oreillons/prof-eng.php#t2 Table 2: Provincial and Territorial recommendations for mumps-containing immunization, 2007], Information on Outbreaks of Mumps In Canada - Information for Health Professionals, Public Health Agency Canada</ref>

Some [[anti-vaccinationists|anti-vaccine activists]] protest against the administration of a vaccine against mumps, claiming that the attenuated vaccine strain is harmful, and/or that the wild disease is beneficial. There is no evidence whatsoever to support the claim that the wild disease is beneficial, or that the [[MMR vaccine]] is harmful. Claims have been made that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism and [[inflammatory bowel disease]], including one study by [[Andrew Wakefield]]<ref>[http://www.aap.org/immunization/families/autismwakefield.html "Critical flaws" in Andrew Wakefield's studies]</ref><ref>[http://autism.about.com/od/causesofautism/a/MMRVaccine.htm Andrew Wakefield's downfall]</ref> (the paper was discredited and retracted in 2010 and Wakefield was later stripped of his license after his work was found to be an "elaborate fraud" <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/05/autism.vaccines/index.html|title= Retracted autism study an 'elaborate fraud,' British journal finds|coauthors=Cohen, Elizabeth;Falco, Miriam |date= 5 January 2011|work= |publisher=CNN |accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref>) that indicated a link between [[gastrointestinal disease]], autism, and the MMR vaccine. Also, subsequent studies indicate no link between vaccination with the MMR and autism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Demicheli V, Rivetti A, Debalini MG, Di Pietrantonj C |title=Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=2 |issue= |pages=CD004407 |year=2012 |pmid=22336803 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub3}}</ref> Since the dangers of the disease are well known, while the dangers of the vaccine are quite minimal, most doctors recommend vaccination.

The [[WHO]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], the [[British Medical Association]] and the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]] currently recommend routine vaccination of children against mumps. The British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain had previously recommended against general mumps vaccination, changing that recommendation in 1987. In 1988 it became United Kingdom government policy to introduce mass child mumps vaccination programmes with the MMR vaccine, and MMR vaccine is now routinely administered in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Before the introduction of the mumps vaccine, the mumps virus was the leading cause of viral meningoencephalitis in the United States. However, encephalitis occurs rarely (less than 2 per 100,000).<ref name=PinkBook_2006>{{cite book | author = Atkinson W, Humiston S, Wolfe C, Nelson R (Editors). | title = Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | edition = 9th | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and prevention | year = 2006 | id =  [http://www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/pink/def_pink_full.htm Fulltext] }}</ref> In one of the largest studies in the literature, the most common symptoms of mumps meningoencephalitis were found to be fever (97%), vomiting (94%) and headache (88.8%).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kanra G, Isik P, Kara A, Cengiz AB, Secmeer G, Ceyhan M | title=Complementary findings in clinical and epidemiologic features of mumps and mumps meningoencephalitis in children without mumps vaccination | journal=Pediatr Int | year=2004 | pages=663–8 | volume=46 | issue=6 | pmid=15660864  | doi = 10.1111/j.1442-200x.2004.01968.x}}</ref> The mumps vaccine was introduced into the United States in December 1967: since its introduction there has been a steady decrease in the incidence of mumps and mumps virus infection. There were 151,209 cases of mumps reported in 1968. Since 2001, the case average was only 265 per year, excluding an outbreak of >6000 cases in 2006 attributed largely to university contagion in young adults.<ref>

==Treatment==
There is no specific treatment for mumps. Symptoms may be relieved by the application of intermittent ice or heat to the affected neck/testicular area and by [[acetaminophen]]/paracetamol for pain relief. [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] (Aspirin) is not used because there is a hypothetical link with [[Reye's syndrome]].  Warm saltwater [[gargle]]s, soft foods, and extra fluids may also help relieve symptoms. 

According to the Department of Health of Minnesota there is no effective post-exposure recommendation to prevent secondary transmission, nor is the post-exposure use of vaccine or [[immunoglobulin]] effective.<ref name="urlMumps Clinical Information - Minnesota Dept. of Health">{{cite web |url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/mumps/hcp/clinical.html |title=Mumps Clinical Information - Minnesota Dept. of Health |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Patients are advised to avoid acidic foods and beverages, since these stimulate the salivary glands, which can be painful.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/mumps-000112.htm |title=Mumps |author= |date= |work=Complementary and Alternative Medicine Guide |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Death is very unusual. The disease is self-limiting, and general outcome is good, even if other organs are involved. Known complications of mumps include:

*Infection of other organ systems
*Mumps viral infections in adolescent and adult males carry an up to 30% risk that the testes may become infected ([[orchitis]] or [[epididymitis]]), which can be quite painful; about half of these infections result in [[testicular atrophy]], and in rare cases sterility can follow.<ref name=Senanayake/>
*Spontaneous abortion in about 27% of cases during the first trimester of pregnancy.<ref name=Senanayake/>
*Mild forms of [[meningitis]] in up to 10% of cases<ref name=Senanayake/> (40% of cases occur without parotid swelling)
*[[Oophoritis]] (inflammation of ovaries) in about 5% of adolescent and adult females,<ref name=Senanayake/> but fertility is rarely affected.
*[[Pancreatitis]] in about 4% of cases, manifesting as abdominal pain and vomiting
*[[Encephalitis]] (very rare, and fatal in about 1% of the cases when it occurs)<ref name=Senanayake/>
*Profound (91 dB or more) but rare sensorineural [[hearing loss]], uni- or bilateral. Acute unilateral deafness occurs in about 0.005% of cases.<ref name=Senanayake/>

After the illness, lifelong [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to mumps generally occurs; reinfection is possible but tends to be mild and atypical.<ref name=Senanayake>{{cite journal |author= Senanayake SN |title=Mumps: a resurgent disease with protean manifestations |journal= Med J Aust |volume=189 |issue=8 |pages=456–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18928441 |doi= |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/189_08_201008/sen10220_fm.html}}</ref>
