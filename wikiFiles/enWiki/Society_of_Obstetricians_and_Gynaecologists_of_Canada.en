==History==
SOGC was founded in 1944 as a response to the need to promote physician education, research and excellence in care.<ref name="SOCG website"/> The members of its Founding Council, which governed from 1944 to 1945, were:
*President: Léon Gérin-Lajoie
*President-elect: William A. Scott
*Vice-president: John D. McQueen
*Secretary: James C. Goodwin
*Treasurer: D. Nelson Henderson
*Councillors: Arthur B. Nash and Hector Sanche<ref name="SOCG website"/>

It was Dr. Léon Gérin-Lajoie, SOGC's first president, who suggested the name "Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada - Société des obstétriciens et gynécologues du Canada". Gérin-Lajoie was one of several SOGC representatives at the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] (FIGO) First World Congress in 1954, and went on to become FIGO's vice-president in 1957, and president in 1958.<ref name="SOCG website"/>

Beginning in the late 1980s, SOGC gradually broadened its purpose to include international women's health, advocacy, aboriginal health, public education, patient safety, and human resources in obstetrics and gynecology. During this period, the society also began admitting members of related medical professions, such as nursing and midwifery.<ref name="SOCG website"/>
