'''Piriformis syndrome''' is a [[neuromuscular]] disorder that occurs when the [[sciatic nerve]] is compressed or otherwise irritated by the [[piriformis muscle]] causing [[pain]], tingling and numbness in the [[buttocks]] and along the path of the [[sciatic nerve]] descending down the lower thigh and into the leg. Diagnosis is often difficult due to few validated and standardized diagnostic tests, but two have been well-described and clinically validated: one is electrophysiological, called the FAIR-test,<ref name="diag1">[{{cite journal | author= Fishman, LM,  Dombi, GW, Michaelsen, C, Ringel, SV,  Rosbruch, J, Rosner, B, and Weber, C | title=Piriformis Syndrome: Diagnosis, treatment and outcome- a ten year study | journal= Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | year= 2002 | volume= 83 | issue=3 | pages=295–302}}</ref>  which measures delay in sciatic nerve conductions when the piriformis muscle is stretched against it.<ref name="diag1">[{{cite book | author=Loren M.

==Pathophysiology==

When the piriformis muscle shortens or spasms due to trauma or overuse, it can compress or strangle the sciatic nerve beneath the muscle. Generally, conditions of this type are referred to as nerve entrapment or as [[entrapment neuropathies]]; the particular condition known as ''piriformis syndrome'' refers to sciatica symptoms not originating from spinal roots and/or spinal disc compression, but involving the overlying piriformis muscle.  In 17% of an assumed normal population the sciatic nerve passes through the piriformis muscle, rather than underneath it, and in 16.2% of patients undergoing surgery for a suspected piriformis syndrome such an anomaly was found leading to doubt about the importance of the anomaly as a factor in piriformis syndrome.<ref name="pmid 16311716">{{cite journal |author= Smoll NR |title= Variations of the Piriformis and Sciatic Nerve With Clinical Consequence: A Review |journal= Clinical Anatomy |volume= 23 |pages= 8–17 |year= 2010 |doi= 10.1002/ca.20893 |pmid= 19998490 |issue= 1}}</ref> Some researchers discount the importance of this relationship in the etiology of the syndrome.<ref name="pmid 16311716"/><ref name="pmid12766656">{{cite journal |author=Benzon HT, Katz JA, Benzon HA, Iqbal MS |title=Piriformis syndrome: anatomic considerations, a new injection technique, and a review of the literature |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=1442–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12766656 |doi=10.1097/00000542-200306000-00022}}</ref> 

Inactive [[gluteal]] muscles also facilitate development of the syndrome.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} These are important in both hip extension and in aiding the [[piriformis]] in [[external rotation]] of the [[femur]]. A major cause for inactive gluteals is unwanted [[reciprocal inhibition]] from overactive [[hip flexors]] ([[psoas major]], [[iliacus]], and [[rectus femoris]]). This imbalance usually occurs where the hip flexors have been trained to be too short and tight, such as when someone sits with hips flexed, as in sitting all day at work. This deprives the [[gluteal]]s of activation, and the [[synergist]]s to the gluteals ([[hamstrings]], [[adductor magnus]], and piriformis) then have to perform extra roles they have not evolved to do. Resulting [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] of the piriformis then produces the typical symptoms. 

[[:Category:Overuse injuries|Overuse injury]] resulting in piriformis syndrome can result from activities performed in the sitting position that involves strenuous use of the legs as in [[Anatomy of a rowing stroke|rowing/sculling]] and [[Cycling|bicycling]].

Runners, bicyclists and other athletes engaging in forward-moving activities are particularly susceptible to developing piriformis syndrome if they do not engage in lateral stretching and strengthening exercises.  When not balanced by lateral movement of the legs, repeated forward movements can lead to disproportionately weak hip abductors and tight adductors.<ref name="drpribut.com">http://www.drpribut.com/sports/piriformis.html</ref> Thus, disproportionately weak hip abductors/gluteus medius muscles, combined with very tight adductor muscles, can cause the piriformis muscle to shorten and severely contract.  Upon a 40% increase in piriformis size, sciatic nerve impingement is inevitable. This means the abductors on the outside cannot work properly and strain is put on the piriformis.<ref name="drpribut.com"/> 

The result of the piriformis muscle spasm can be impingement of not only the sciatic nerve but also the [[pudendal nerve]].<ref>http://www.chiroweb.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=44401</ref>
The [[pudendal nerve]] controls the muscles of the bowels and bladder. Symptoms of pudendal nerve entrapment include tingling and numbness in the groin and saddle areas, and can lead to urinary and fecal incontinence.

When piriformis syndrome is caused by weak abductors combined with tight adductors, a highly effective and easy treatment includes stretching and strengthening these muscle groups.  An exercise regimen targeting the gluteus medius and hip abductor muscle groups can alleviate symptoms of piriformis syndrome within days. 

Another purported cause for piriformis syndrome is stiffness, or hypomobility, of the [[sacroiliac joint]]s. The resulting compensatory changes in [[gait]] would then result in shearing of one of the origins of the piriformis, and possibly some of the gluteal muscles as well, resulting not only in piriformis malfunction but in other low back pain syndromes as well.

Piriformis syndrome can also be caused by [[pronation|overpronation]] of the foot.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  When a foot overpronates it causes the [[knee]] to turn [[medially]], causing the [[piriformis]] to activate to prevent over-rotating the knee.  This causes the piriformis to become overused and therefore tight, eventually leading to piriformis syndrome.

Piriformis syndrome may also be associated with falling injury.<ref name="pmid17385355">{{cite journal |author=Kuncewicz E, Gajewska E, Sobieska M, Samborski W |title=Piriformis muscle syndrome |journal=Annales Academiae Medicae Stetinensis |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=99–101; discussion 101 |year=2006 |pmid=17385355 |doi=}}</ref>

==The Sciatic Nerve==
The affected nerve in piriformis syndrome is the sciatic nerve. Collectively the [[tibial]] and [[common fibular nerve]] makes up the general term sciatic nerve.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Saladin | first1 = Kenneth S. | title = Anatomy  physiology : the unity of form and functio | year = 2004 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Higher Education | location = Boston | isbn = 0-07-242903-8 | pages =  }}</ref> Since the sciatic nerve is so close to the piriformis it is acknowledged that the muscle plays a role in irritating the nerve.

==Other presentations==
In addition to causing [[gluteal]] pain that may radiate down buttocks and the leg, the syndrome may present with pain that is relieved by walking with the foot on the involved side pointing outward. This position externally rotates the hip, lessening the stretch on the piriformis and relieving the pain slightly.  Piriformis syndrome is also known as "wallet sciatica" or "fat wallet syndrome," as the condition can be caused or aggravated by sitting with a large [[wallet]] in the affected side's rear pocket.<ref>[http://iach.amedd.army.mil/sections/clinics/physicalTherapy/pdf/PIRIFORMIS%20SYNDROME.pdf Piriformis Syndrome (Hip/Buttocks Pain)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
We know that Piriformis syndrome occurs when the [[Sciatic nerve]] is compressed or pinched by the [[Piriformis muscle]].  Indications include sciatica (radiating pain in the buttock, posterior thigh and lower leg) and the physical exam finding of tenderness in the area of the sciatic notch.  The pain is exacerbated with activity, prolonged sitting, or walking.  The diagnosis is largely clinical and is one of exclusion. In physical examination, attempts are made to stretch the irritated piriformis and provoke sciatic nerve compression, such as the Freiberg, the Pace, and the FAIR (flexion, adduction, internal rotation) maneuvers.  Conditions to be ruled out include herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), facet arthropathy, spinal stenosis, and lumbar muscle strain.<ref name="pmid19466717" />

Diagnostic modalities such as CT, MRI, ultrasound, and EMG are mostly useful in excluding other conditions.  However, [[magnetic resonance neurography]] is a medical imaging technique that can show the presence of irritation of the sciatic nerve at the level of the sciatic notch where the nerve passes under the piriformis muscle. Magnetic resonance neurography is considered "investigational/not medically necessary" by some insurance companies. Neurography can determine whether or not a patient has a split sciatic nerve or a split piriformis muscle – this may be important in getting a good result from injections or surgery. Image guided injections carried out in an open MRI scanner, or other 3D image guidance can accurately relax the piriformis muscle to test the diagnosis. Other injection methods such as blind injection, fluoroscopic guided injection, ultrasound, or EMG guidance can work but are not as reliable and have other drawbacks.

==Treatment==
Symptomatic relief of muscle and nerve pain can be obtained by [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] and/or muscle relaxants. Conservative treatment usually begins with stretching exercises, myofascial release, massage, and avoidance of contributory activities, such as running, bicycling, rowing, etc. Some clinicians recommend formal [[physical therapy]], including the teaching of stretching techniques, [[massage]], and strengthening of the core muscles ([[Abdominals|abs]], [[back]], etc.) to reduce strain on the piriformis.

===Stretching===

Stretching is recommended every 2 to 3 waking hours.  For optimal stretching capacity, move the hip joint capsule anteriorly and posteriorly.<ref>Klein, M. J. (2012). Physical medicine and rehabilitation for piriformis syndrome. In C. Lorenzo (Ed.),Medscape Reference: Drugs, Diseases and Procedures.</ref>    The muscle is manually stretched by applying pressure perpendicular to the long axis of the muscle and parallel to the surface of the buttocks until the muscle is relaxed.<ref name="Steiner-1987">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Steiner | first1 = C. | last2 = Staubs | first2 = C. | last3 = Ganon | first3 = M. | last4 = Buhlinger | first4 = C. | title = Piriformis syndrome: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. | journal = J Am Osteopath Assoc | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 318–23 | month = Apr | year = 1987 | doi =  | PMID = 3583849 }}</ref>  Another stretching exercise is to lie on the side opposite of the pain with the hip and knee of the upper leg flexed and adducted towards the ground while the torso is rotated so that the back of the upper shoulder touches the ground.<ref name="Fishman-2002">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fishman | first1 = LM. | last2 = Dombi | first2 = GW. | last3 = Michaelsen | first3 = C. | last4 = Ringel | first4 = S. | last5 = Rozbruch | first5 = J. | last6 = Rosner | first6 = B. | last7 = Weber | first7 = C. | title = Piriformis syndrome: diagnosis, treatment, and outcome--a 10-year study. | journal = Arch Phys Med Rehabil | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 295–301 | month = Mar | year = 2002 | doi =  | PMID = 11887107 }}</ref> Chiropractors may suggest stretching exercises that will target the piriformis, but may also include the [[hamstrings]] and [[hip muscles]] in order to adequately reduce pain and increase [[range of motion]].  Patients with piriformis syndrome may also find relief from ice.  Ice can be helpful when the pain starts, or immediately after an activity that causes pain. This may be simply an ice pack, or ice massage.

===Strengthening===

Muscle strengthening involves working on the hip abductors, external rotators and extensors.<ref name="Tonley-2010">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Tonley | first1 = JC. | last2 = Yun | first2 = SM. | last3 = Kochevar | first3 = RJ. | last4 = Dye | first4 = JA. | last5 = Farrokhi | first5 = S. | last6 = Powers | first6 = CM. | title = Treatment of an individual with piriformis syndrome focusing on hip muscle strengthening and movement reeducation: a case report. | journal = J Orthop Sports Phys Ther | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–11 | month = Feb | year = 2010 | doi = 10.2519/jospt.2010.3108 | PMID = 20118521 }}</ref>  This treatment involves three phases: non-weight bearing exercises, weight bearing exercises, and ballistic exercises.

Failure of conservative treatments described above may lead to consideration of various therapeutic injections such as local anesthetics (e.g., [[lidocaine]]), [[Anti-inflammatory]] drugs and/or [[corticosteroids]], [[botulinum toxin]] (BTX, BOTOX), or a combination of the three.<ref name="pmid19466717" />  Injection technique (discussed in above section) is a significant issue since the piriformis is a very deep seated muscle. A radiologist may assist in this clinical setting by injecting a small dose of medication containing a paralysing agent such as botulinum toxin under high-frequency ultrasound or CT control. This inactivates the piriformis muscle for 3 to 6 months, without resulting in leg weakness or impaired activity.<ref name="pmid15043354">{{cite journal |author=Lang AM |title=Botulinum toxin type B in piriformis syndrome |journal=Am J Phys Med Rehabil. |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=198–202 |year=2004 |pmid=15043354 |doi=10.1097/01.PHM.0000113404.35647.D8}}</ref>

Rarely surgery may be recommended.  The [[prognosis]] is generally good.  Minimal access surgery using newly reported techniques has also proven successful in a large-scale formal outcome published in 2005.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080203103144/http://jnsonline.org/spine/issues/v2n2/toc.html JNS: Spine Table of Contents Menu<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Failure of piriformis syndrome treatment may be secondary to an underlying obturator internus muscle injury.[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/308798-treatment#TreatmentMedicalIssuesComplications]
