== Funding research==
Children With Leukaemia has become a major funder of scientific research and since 2004 this funding has been granted by a peer-reviewed process as recognised by the Association of Medical Research Charities.<ref>[http://www.leukaemia.org/what-we-do/fund-research CHILDREN with LEUKAEMIA:fund research]</ref>  Applications for funding are initially reviewed by a panel made up of at least two members of the organisation’s Scientific Advisory Committee<ref>[http://www.leukaemia.org/about-us/our-scientific-advisors CHILDREN with LEUKAEMIA:our scientific advisors]</ref> and relevant external reviewers from within the appropriate scientific field. This process results in the funding of world-class research.

Children With Leukaemia research endeavours to investigate what causes childhood leukaemia and, ultimately, how to prevent it. 

Children With Leukaemia is working to develop treatments which are not only more effective, driving up the survival rate, but which are less punishing, reducing the risk of the side-effects associated with current treatments.<ref>[http://www.leukaemia.org/what-we-do/fund-research CHILDREN with LEUKAEMIA:fund research]</ref>

== Raising awareness ==
Little is currently known about what causes children to develop leukaemia. The number of new cases being diagnosed has been increasing, suggesting that aspects of our changing lifestyle may play a role.<ref>[http://www.leukaemia.org/what-we-do/fund-research CHILDREN with LEUKAEMIA:fund research]</ref>
 
Children With Leukaemia is working with policy makers to raise awareness of the association between childhood leukaemia and high-voltage power lines. It is seeking to gain support for a building moratorium to stop new houses being built near power lines.<ref>[http://www.leukaemia.org/what-we-do/campaigning CHILDREN with LEUKAEMIA:campaigning]</ref> 

Children With Leukaemia raises awareness of childhood leukaemia by providing information to the public on new scientific research and through celebrity appeals and fundraising efforts.<ref>[http://www.leukaemia.org/what-we-do/raise-awareness/inform CHILDREN with LEUKAEMIA:raising awareness]</ref>
