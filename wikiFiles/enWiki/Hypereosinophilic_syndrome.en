The '''hypereosinophilic syndrome''' (HES) is a disease characterized by a persistently [[Eosinophilia|elevated eosinophil count]] (≥ 1500 eosinophils/mm³) in the blood for at least six months without any recognizable cause, with involvement of either the [[heart]], [[nervous system]], or [[bone marrow]].<ref name="pmid1090795">{{cite journal |author=Chusid MJ, Dale DC, West BC, Wolff SM |title=The hypereosinophilic syndrome: analysis of fourteen cases with review of the literature |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |year=1975 |pmid=1090795 |doi=10.1097/00005792-197501000-00001}}</ref> 

HES is a diagnosis of exclusion, after clonal eosinophilia (such as leukemia) and reactive eosinophilia (in response to infection, autoimmune disease, atopy, hypoadrenalism, [[tropical eosinophilia]], or cancer) have been ruled out.<ref name="Fazel"><New England Journal of Medicine 360:2005 (2009)</ref>

If left untreated, HES is progressively fatal. It is treated with glucocorticoids such as prednisone.<ref name="Fazel"/> The addition of the monoclonal antibody [[mepolizumab]] may reduce the dose of glucocorticoids.<ref name="nejm">{{cite web | last = Scheinfeld | first = Noah S | title = Hypereosinophilic Syndrome | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMoa070812 | accessdate = 2008-02-15 }}</ref>

==Classification==
In the heart, there are two forms of the hypereosinophilic syndrome, endomyocardial fibrosis and [[Loeffler's endocarditis]].  
* Endomyocardial fibrosis (also known as Davies disease) is seen in tropical areas.<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |pages=606 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="pmid15856635">{{cite journal |author=Smedema JP, Winckels SK, Snoep G, Vainer J, Bekkers SC, Crijns HJ |title=Tropical endomyocardial fibrosis (Davies' disease): case report demonstrating the role of magnetic resonance imaging |journal=Int J Cardiovasc Imaging |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=517–22 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15856635 |doi= 10.1007/s10554-004-1095-9|url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=1569-5794&volume=20&page=517}}</ref>
* Loeffler's endocarditis does not have any geographic predisposition.

==Signs and symptoms==
As HES affects many organs at the same time, symptoms may be numerous. Some possible symptoms a patient may present with include:
:*[[Cardiomyopathy]]<ref name="oxford"/>
:*Skin [[lesions]]<ref name="oxford"/>
:*[[Thromboembolic disease]]<ref name="oxford"/>
:*[[Pulmonary disease]]<ref name="oxford"/>
:*[[Neuropathy]]<ref name="oxford"/>
:*[[Hepatosplenomegaly]]<ref name="oxford"/>
:*Reduced [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] size<ref name="oxford"/>

==Diagnosis==
Numerous techniques are used to diagnose hypereosinophilic syndrome, of which the most important is blood testing. In HES, the eosinophil count is greater than 1.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L.<ref name="emedicine"/> On some smears the eosinophils may appear normal in appearance, but morphologic abnormalities, such as a lowering of granule numbers and size, can be observed.<ref name="emedicine"/> Roughly 50% of patients with HES also have [[anaemia]].<ref name="emedicine"/>

Secondly, various imaging and diagnostic technological methods are utilised to detect defects to the heart and other organs, such as valvular dysfunction and [[arrhythmia]]s by usage of [[echocardiography]].<ref name="emedicine"/> Chest radiographs may indicate pleural effusions and/or [[fibrosis]],<ref name="emedicine"/> and neurological tests such as [[CT Scan|CT scans]] can show strokes and increased [[cerebrospinal fluid]] pressure.<ref name="emedicine"/>

A proportion of patients have a mutation involving the ''[[PDGFRA]]'' and ''[[FIP1L1]]'' genes on [[chromosome 4 (human)|the fourth chromosome]], leading to a [[tyrosine kinase]] [[fusion protein]]. Testing for this mutation is now routine practice, as its presence indicates response to [[imatinib]], a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.<ref name="pmid12660384">{{cite journal |author=Cools J, DeAngelo DJ, Gotlib J, ''et al.'' |title=A tyrosine kinase created by fusion of the PDGFRA and FIP1L1 genes as a therapeutic target of imatinib in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=348 |issue=13 |pages=1201–14 |year=2003 |pmid=12660384 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa025217|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/348/13/1201}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment primarily consists of reducing eosinophil levels and preventing further damage to organs.<ref name="emedicine"/> [[Corticosteroids]], such as [[Prednisone]], are good for reducing eosinophil levels and antineoplastics are useful for slowing eosinophil production.<ref name="emedicine"/> Surgical therapy is rarely utilised, however [[splenectomy]] can reduce the pain due to [[spleen]] enlargement.<ref name="emedicine"/> If damage to the heart (in particular the [[heart valve|valves]]), then [[prosthetic]] valves can replace the current organic ones.<ref name="emedicine"/> Follow-up care is vital for the survival of the patient, as such the patient should be checked for any signs of deterioration regularly.<ref name="emedicine"/> After promising results in drug trials (95% efficiency in reducing blood eosinophil count to acceptable levels) it is hoped that in the future hypereosinophilic syndrome, and diseases related to eosinophils such as [[asthma]] and [[Churg-Strauss syndrome]], may be treated with the monoclonal antibody Mepolizumab currently being developed to treat the disease.<ref name="nejm"/> If this becomes successful, it may be possible for corticosteroids to be eradicated and thus reduce the amount of side effects encountered.<ref name="nejm"/>

==Epidemiology==
HES is very rare, with only 50 cases being noted and followed up in the United States between 1971 and 1982,<ref name="emedicine"/> corresponding roughly to a prevalence of 1 to 2 per million people. The disease is even more uncommon within the [[paediatric]] population.<ref name="emedicine"/>

Patients who lack [[chronic heart failure]] and those who respond well to Prednisone or a similar drug have a good [[prognosis]].<ref name="emedicine"/> However, the mortality rate rises in patients with anaemia, [[chromosome|chromosomal]] abnormalities or a very high white blood cell count.<ref name="emedicine"/>
