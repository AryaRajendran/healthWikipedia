'''Folliculitis''' (also known as '''"Hot Tub Rash"''') is the [[inflammation]] of one or more [[hair follicle]]s. The condition may occur anywhere on the [[skin]] with the exception of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They may appear as red dots that come to white tips on the chest, back and arms.

== Causes ==
Most [[carbuncle]]s, [[furuncle]]s, and other cases of folliculitis develop from ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.

Folliculitis starts when hair follicles are damaged by [[friction]] from [[clothing]], an insect bite,{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} blockage of the follicle, [[shaving]], or braids too tight and too close to the scalp. In most cases of folliculitis, the damaged follicles are then infected with the [[bacterium]] ''[[Staphylococcus]]''.

[[Iron deficiency anemia]] is sometimes associated with chronic cases.

===Fungal===
*[[Tinea barbae]] is similar to barber's itch, but the infection is caused by the [[fungus]] [[T. rubrum]].
* '''Malassezia folliculitis''', formerly known as '''[[Pityrosporum folliculitis]]''', is caused by [[yeast]]s ([[fungus|fungi]]) of the [[genus]] [[Malassezia]].

===Bacterial===
*[[Hot-tub folliculitis]] is caused by the bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001460|Hot tub folliculitis}}
</ref>  The folliculitis usually occurs after sitting in a hot tub that was not properly cleaned before use.  Symptoms are found around the body parts that sit in the hot tubâ€”typically the legs, hips, [[buttocks]], and surrounding areas.  Symptoms are typically amplified around regions that were covered by wet clothing, such as [[bathing suit]]s. 
* [[Sycosis vulgaris]], '''Sycosis barbae''' or '''Barber's itch''' is a [[staphylococcus]] infection of the hair follicles in the bearded area of the face, usually the upper lip. Shaving aggravates the condition.
* [[Gram-negative folliculitis]] may appear after prolonged acne treatment with antibiotics.<ref name="AAoD_gnf">{{cite web |url=http://www.skincarephysicians.com/acnenet/severeacne4types.html#3 |title=Severe Acne: 4 types |date= |work= |publisher=American Academy of Dermatology |accessdate=December 15, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v07qRcEr |archivedate=December 15, 2010}}</ref>

===Viral===
* '''[[Herpetic folliculitis]]''' may occur when Herpes Simplex Virus infection spreads to nearby hair follicles - mostly around the mouth.

===Non-infectious===
*[[Pseudofolliculitis barbae]] is a disorder occurring when hair curves back into the skin and causes inflammation.
* [[Eosinophilic folliculitis]] may appear in persons with impaired immune systems.
* [[Folliculitis decalvans]] or '''tufted folliculitis''' usually affects scalp. Several hairs arise from the same hair follicle. Scarring and permanent hair loss may follow. The cause is unknown.
* [[Folliculitis keloidalis]] scarring on the nape of the neck, most common among males of curly hair.
* Oil folliculitis is inflammation of hair follicles due to exposure to various oils and typically occurs on forearms or thighs. It is common in refinery workers, road workers, mechanics, sheep shearers. Even makeup may cause it.
* '''Malignancy''' may also be represented by recalcitrant cases.<ref>Folliculitis, follicular mucinosis, and papular mucinosis as a presentation of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

== Symptoms ==
*[[rash]] (reddened skin area)
*[[pimple]]s or [[pustule]]s located around a hair follicle
**may crust over
**typically occur on neck, [[axilla|armpit]], or [[groin]] area
**may present as [[genital]] [[lesion]]s
*itching skin
*spreading from leg to arm to body through improper treatment of antibiotics

== Treatment ==
#Topical [[antiseptic]] treatment is adequate for most cases
#Topical [[antibiotic]]s such as [[mupirocin]] or [[neomycin]] containing ointment
#Some patients may benefit from systemic [[Beta-lactam antibiotic#Narrow-spectrum penicillinase-resistant penicillins|narrow-spectrum penicillinase-resistant penicillins]] (such as [[dicloxacillin]] in US, or [[flucloxacillin]] in UK)
#Fungal folliculitis can worsen with antibiotics and may require an oral antifungal such as [[Fluconazole]]. Topical antifungals such as Econazole Nitrate may also be effective.
