'''Acute coronary syndrome''' (ACS) refers to any group of symptoms attributed to obstruction of the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]]. The most common symptom prompting diagnosis of ACS is [[chest pain]], often radiating of the left arm or angle of the jaw, pressure-like in character, and associated with nausea and sweating. Acute coronary syndrome usually occurs as a result of one of three problems: [[ST elevation myocardial infarction]] (30%), [[non ST elevation myocardial infarction]] (25%), or [[unstable angina]] (38%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Torres M, Moayedi S |title=Evaluation of the acutely dyspneic elderly patient |journal=Clin. Geriatr. Med. |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=307–25, vi |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17462519 |doi=10.1016/j.cger.2007.01.007 |url=}}</ref>

These types are named according to the appearance of the [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG) as ''non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction'' (NSTEMI) and ''ST segment elevation myocardial infarction'' (STEMI).<ref name="pmid12791748">{{cite journal |author=Grech ED, Ramsdale DR |title=Acute coronary syndrome: unstable angina and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7401 |pages=1259–61 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12791748 |pmc=1126130 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7401.1259 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12791748}}</ref> There can be some variation as to which forms of [[myocardial infarction]] (MI) are classified under acute coronary syndrome.<ref name="urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:acute coronary syndrome">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/nine/14170699.htm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:acute coronary syndrome |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

ACS should be distinguished from [[angina pectoris|''stable'' angina]], which develops during exertion and resolves at rest. In contrast with stable angina, unstable angina occurs suddenly, often at rest or with minimal exertion, or at lesser degrees of exertion than the individual's previous angina ("crescendo angina").  New onset angina is also considered unstable angina, since it suggests a new problem in a coronary artery.

Though ACS is usually associated with [[coronary thrombosis]], it can also be associated with [[cocaine]] use.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Achar SA, Kundu S, Norcross WA |title=Diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=119–26 |year=2005  |pmid=16035692 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20050701/119.html}}</ref> Cardiac chest pain can also be precipitated by [[anemia]], [[bradycardia]]s (excessively slow heart rate) or [[tachycardia]]s (excessively fast heart rate).

==Signs and symptoms==
The cardinal sign of decreased blood flow to the heart is chest pain experienced as tightness around the chest and radiating to the left arm and the left angle of the jaw. This may be associated with [[diaphoresis]] (sweating), [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], as well as [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]]. In many cases, the sensation is "atypical", with pain experienced in different ways or even being completely absent (which is more likely in female patients and those with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]). Some may report [[palpitation]]s, anxiety or a sense of impending doom ([[angor animi]]) and a feeling of being acutely ill.

The description of the chest discomfort as a pressure has little utility in aiding a diagnosis as it is not [[specific]] for ACS.<ref name=ER09>{{cite journal |author=Woo KM, Schneider JI |title=High-risk chief complaints I: chest pain--the big three |journal=Emerg. Med. Clin. North Am. |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=685–712, x |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19932401 |doi=10.1016/j.emc.2009.07.007 |url=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

===Electrocardiogram===
In the setting of acute chest pain, the [[electrocardiogram]] is the investigation that most reliably distinguishes between various causes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chun AA, McGee SR |title=Bedside diagnosis of coronary artery disease: a systematic review |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=117 |issue=5 |pages=334–43 |year=2004 |pmid=15336583 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.03.021}}</ref> If this indicates acute heart damage (elevation in the ''ST segment'', new [[left bundle branch block]]), treatment for a heart attack in the form of [[angioplasty]] or [[thrombolysis]] is indicated immediately (see below). In the absence of such changes, it is not possible to immediately distinguish between unstable angina and NSTEMI.

===Imaging and blood tests===
As it is only one of the many potential causes of [[chest pain]], the patient usually has a number of tests in the [[emergency department]], such as a [[chest X-ray]], [[blood test]]s (including [[cardiac marker|myocardial markers]] such as [[troponin]] I or T, and [[Heart-type fatty acid binding protein|H-FABP]] and/or a [[D-dimer]] if a [[pulmonary embolism]] is suspected), and telemetry (monitoring of the heart rhythm).

===Prediction scores===
The ACI-TIPI score can be used to aid diagnosis; using seven variables from the admission record, this score predicts crudely which patients are likely to have myocardial ischemia.<ref name="pmid2072767">{{cite journal |author=Selker HP, Griffith JL, D'Agostino RB |title=A tool for judging coronary care unit admission appropriateness, valid for both real-time and retrospective use.

This particular study had an 8.4% prevalence of acute coronary syndrome, which means the [[positive predictive value]] of being a male with chest pain and having coronary syndrome is 9.6% and [[negative predictive value]] is 93.2% ( [http://medinformatics.uthscsa.edu/calculator/calc.shtml?calc_dx_SnSp.shtml?prevalence=8.4&sensitivity=65.2&specificity=44 click here] to adjust these results for patients at higher or lower risk of acute coronary syndrome).

In a second [[cohort study]], exercise electrocardiography was similarly found to be a poor predictor of acute coronary syndrome at follow-up.<ref name="pmid19008264">{{cite journal| author=|title=Incremental prognostic value of the exercise electrocardiogram in the initial assessment of patients with suspected angina: cohort study.|year=2008|journal=BMJ(Clinical research ed.) |pmid=19008264|pmc=2583389|doi=10.1136/bmj.a2240| last1=Sekhri| first1=N| last2=Feder| first2=GS| last3=Junghans| first3=C| last4=Eldridge| first4=S| last5=Umaipalan| first5=A| last6=Madhu| first6=R| last7=Hemingway| first7=H| last8=Timmis| first8=AD| volume=337| pages=a2240}}</ref> Of the patients who had a coronary event at 6 years of follow up, 47% had a negative ECG at the start of the study. With an average follow up of 2.21 years the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curves gave resting ECG a score of 0.72 and exercise ECG a score of 0.74.

==Prevention==
Acute coronary syndrome often reflects a degree of damage to the coronaries by [[atherosclerosis]]. Primary prevention of atherosclerosis is controlling the risk factors: healthy eating, exercise, treatment for [[hypertension]] and [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], avoiding [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] and controlling [[cholesterol]] levels; in patients with significant risk factors, [[aspirin]] has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Secondary prevention is discussed in [[myocardial infarction]].

After a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places was introduced in Scotland in March 2006, there was a 17% reduction in hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome. 67% of the decrease occurred in non-smokers.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1056/NEJMsa0706740| title=Smoke-free Legislation and Hospitalizations for Acute Coronary Syndrome| year=2008| author=Pell JP, Haw S, Cobbe S ''et al.''| journal=New England Journal of Medicine| volume=359| pages=482–91| pmid=18669427| issue=5}}</ref>

==Treatment==
People with presumed ACS are typically treated with [[aspirin]], [[Clopidogrel]], [[nitroglycerin]], and if the chest discomfort persists [[morphine]].<ref name=AHA10>{{cite journal |author=O'Connor RE, Brady W, Brooks SC, ''et al.'' |title=Part 10: acute coronary syndromes: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl 3 |pages=S787–817 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=20956226 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971028 |url=}}</ref> Other [[analgesics]] such as [[nitrous oxide]] are of unknown benefit.<ref name=AHA10/>

===STEMI===
{{main|Myocardial infarction}}

If the ECG confirms changes suggestive of [[myocardial infarction]] (ST elevations in specific leads, a new left bundle branch block or a true posterior MI pattern), [[thrombolytics]] may be administered or [[angioplasty|primary coronary angioplasty]] may be performed. In the former, medication is injected that stimulates [[fibrinolysis]], destroying blood clots obstructing the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]]. In the latter, a flexible catheter is passed via the femoral or radial [[arteries]] and advanced to the heart to identify blockages in the coronaries. When occlusions are found, they can be intervened upon mechanically with [[angioplasty]] and usually [[stent]] deployment if a lesion, termed the ''culprit'' lesion, is thought to be causing myocardial damage.  Data suggest that rapid [[triage]], transfer and treatment is essential.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Blankenship JC, Skelding KA | year = 2008 | title = Rapid Triage, Transfer, and Treatment with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction | url = http://www.remedicajournals.com/Acute-Coronary-Syndromes/showarticleattachment.aspx?aaid=4400&PortalID=71 | journal = Acute Coronary Syndromes | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 59–65 }}</ref> The time frame for door-to-needle thrombolytic administration according to [[American College of Cardiology]] (ACC) guidelines should be within 30 minutes, whereas the door-to-balloon Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) time should be less than 90 minutes.  It was found that [[thrombolysis]] is more likely to be delivered within the established ACC guidelines among patients with [[STEMI]] as compared to PCI according to a [[case control]] study .<ref name="pmid19898701">{{cite journal| author=|title=Thrombolysis versus primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST elevation myocardial infarctions at Chilliwack General Hospital.|year=2009|journal=The Canadian journal of cardiology |pmid=19898701|pmc=2776568|doi=| last1=Janda| first1=SP| last2=Tan| first2=N| volume=25| issue=11| pages=e382–4}}</ref>

===NSTEMI and NSTE-ACS===
If the ECG does not show typical changes, the term "non-ST segment elevation ACS" is applied. The patient may still have suffered a "non-ST elevation MI" (NSTEMI). The accepted management of unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome is therefore empirical treatment with [[aspirin]], a second [[platelet inhibitor]] such as [[clopidogrel]], [[prasugrel]] or [[ticagrelor]], and [[heparin]] (usually a [[low-molecular weight heparin]] such as [[enoxaparin]]), with intravenous [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|glyceryl trinitrate]] and [[opioid]]s if the pain persists.

A blood test is generally performed for cardiac troponins twelve hours after onset of the pain. If this is positive, [[coronary angiography]] is typically performed on an urgent basis, as this is highly predictive of a heart attack in the near-future. If the troponin is negative, a treadmill exercise test or a thallium scintigram may be requested.

If there is no evidence of ST segment elevation on the [[electrocardiogram]], delaying urgent [[angioplasty]] until the next morning is not inferior to doing so immediately.<ref name="pmid19724041">{{cite journal| author=Montalescot G, Cayla G, Collet JP, Elhadad S, Beygui F, Le Breton H et al.| title=Immediate vs delayed intervention for acute coronary syndromes: a randomized clinical trial. | journal=JAMA | year= 2009 | volume= 302 | issue= 9 | pages= 947–54 | pmid=19724041 | doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1267 }}</ref>

In a [[cohort study]] comparing [[NSTEMI]] and [[STEMI]], patients with [[NSTEMI]] had statistically similar [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] at one year after [[Percutaneous coronary intervention|PCI]] as compared to patients with [[STEMI]] (3.4% vs 4.4%).<ref name="pmid16860018">{{cite journal| author=|title=Comparative early and late outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in ST-segment elevation and non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (from the CADILLAC trial).|year=2006|journal=The American journal of cardiology|pmid=16860018|pmc=|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2006.01.102| last1=Cox| first1=DA| last2=Stone| first2=GW| last3=Grines| first3=CL| last4=Stuckey| first4=T| last5=Zimetbaum| first5=PJ| last6=Tcheng| first6=JE| last7=Turco| first7=M| last8=Garcia| first8=E| last9=Guagliumi| first9=G| volume=98| issue=3| pages=331–7}}</ref> However, NSTEMI had significantly more "major cardiac events" (death, [[myocardial infarction]], disabling [[stroke]], or requiring [[revascularization]]) at one year (24.0% vs 16.6%).

[[Cocaine]] associated ACS should be managed in a manner similar to other patients with acute coronary syndrome except [[beta blocker]]s should not be used and [[benzodiazepines]] should be administered early.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McCord J, Jneid H, Hollander JE, ''et al.'' |title=Management of cocaine-associated chest pain and myocardial infarction: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Acute Cardiac Care Committee of the Council on Clinical Cardiology |journal=Circulation |volume=117 |issue=14 |pages=1897–907 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18347214 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.188950 |url=}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
===TIMI score===
The [[TIMI]] risk score can identify high risk patients<ref name="pmid10938172">{{cite journal |author=Antman EM, Cohen M, Bernink PJ, ''et al.'' |title=The TIMI risk score for unstable angina/non-ST elevation MI: A method for prognostication and therapeutic decision making |journal=JAMA |volume=284 |issue=7 |pages=835–42 |year=2000 |pmid=10938172 |doi=10.1001/jama.284.7.835}}</ref> and has been independently validated.<ref name="pmid16365321">{{cite journal |author=Pollack CV, Sites FD, Shofer FS, Sease KL, Hollander JE |title=Application of the TIMI risk score for unstable angina and non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome to an unselected emergency department chest pain population |journal=Academic Emergency Medicine |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=13–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16365321 |doi=10.1197/j.aem.2005.06.031}}</ref><ref name="pmid16934646">{{cite journal |author=Chase M, Robey JL, Zogby KE, Sease KL, Shofer FS, Hollander JE |title=Prospective validation of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Risk Score in the emergency department chest pain population |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=252–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16934646 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.01.032}}</ref>

===Biomarkers for diagnosis===
The aim of diagnostic markers is to identify patients with ACS even when there is no evidence of heart muscle damage.
*Ischemia-Modified Albumin (IMA) - In cases of Ischemia - Albumin undergoes a conformational change and loses its ability to bind transitional metals (copper or cobalt). IMA can be used to assess the proportion of modified albumin in ischemia. Its use is limited to ruling out ischemia rather than a diagnostic test for the occurrence of ischemia.
*Myeloperoxidase (MPO) - The levels of circulating MPO, a leukocyte enzyme, elevate early after ACS and can be used as an early marker for the condition.

*Glycogen Phosphorylase Isoenzyme BB-([[GPBB]]) is an early marker of cardiac ischemia and is one of three [[isoenzymes|isoenzyme]] of Glycogen Phosphorylase.

*[[Troponin]] is a late cardiac marker of ACS

===Biomarkers for Risk Stratification===
The aim of prognostic markers is to reflect different components of pathophysiology of ACS. For example:
*Natriuretic peptide - Both B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal Pro BNP can be applied to predict the risk of death and heart failure following ACS.
*Monocyte chemo attractive protein (MCP)-1 - has been shown in a number of studies to identify patients with a higher risk of adverse outcomes after ACS.
