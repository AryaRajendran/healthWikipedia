'''Extramammary Paget’s disease''' ('''EMPD'''), also '''extramammary Paget disease''', is a rare, slow-growing, usually noninvasive intraepithelial (in the [[skin]]) [[adenocarcinoma]] outside of the [[mammary gland]] and includes Paget's disease of the [[vulva]] and the extremely rare Paget's disease of the [[penis]].<ref name=Ekwueme>

</ref> Extramammary Paget’s disease involves primarily the epidermis, but occasionally extends into the underlying dermis.<ref name=Ekwueme/> It has a predilection for [[apocrine gland]]-bearing areas, mostly the [[perineum]], vulva, [[axilla]], [[scrotum]], and penis.<ref name=Ekwueme/>

==Prognosis and comorbity==
Extramammary Paget's disease is usually seen in isolation and is associated with an underlying invasive malignancy about 12% of the time.  It is associated with an underlying adnexal malignancy about 24% of the time.  [[Paget's disease of the breast]] is almost always associated with an underlying invasive [[malignancy]], i.e. [[breast cancer]] (e.g. [[mammary ductal carcinoma]]).

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Extramammary Paget disease - w cond - very high mag.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Micrograph]] of extramammary Paget's disease, [[H&E stain]]]]
Signs and symptoms are [[skin lesion]]s, often mistaken as [[eczema]], that may be [[itch]]y or painful. A [[biopsy]] will establish the [[diagnosis]]. The [[histology]] of the lesion is the same as for Paget's disease of the breast.

==Types==
Paget's disease of the vulva, a rare disease, may be a primary lesion or associated with adenocarcinoma originating from local organs such as the [[Bartholin gland]], the [[urethra]], or the [[rectum]] and thus be secondary. Patients tend to be [[postmenopausal]].

Paget's disease of the penis may also be primary or secondary, and is even rarer than genital Paget’s disease in women. At least one case has been misdiagnosed as [[Bowen's disease]].<ref name=Ekwueme/> Isolated Paget's disease of the penis is extremely rare.<ref name=Ekwueme/>

==Primary disease==
It is important to exclude that the lesion is associated with another cancer. Primary disease is usually treated by [[surgery|surgical]] [[:wikt:excision|excision]].

==History==
[[James Paget]] described Paget's disease of the nipple in 1874. Radcliffe Crocker reported the first case of EMPD in 1889, when he described a patient with a skin lesion affecting the penis and [[scrotum]], the findings of which were identical to those described by Paget.
