'''Immunoproliferative disorders''' (also known as “immunoproliferative diseases” or “immunoproliferative neoplasms”) are disorders of the [[immune system]] that are characterized by the abnormal proliferation of the primary cells of the immune system, which includes [[B cell]]s, [[T cell]]s and [[Natural killer]] (NK) cells, or by the excessive production of [[immunoglobulin]]s (also known as antibodies).

==Classes==
These disorders are subdivided into three main classes, which are [[lymphoproliferative disorders]], [[hypergammaglobulinemia]], and [[paraproteinemia]].<ref name="item5">Health Communication Network. Immunoproliferative disorders - Topic Tree.

* ''Lymphoproliferative disorders'' (LPDs) refer to several conditions in which lymphocytes are produced in excessive quantities. They typically occur in patients who have compromised immune systems. This subset is sometimes incorrectly equated with "immunoproliferative disorders".

* Humoral
** ''Hypergammaglobulinemia'' is characterized by increased levels of [[immunoglobulin]]s in the blood serum.  Five different hypergammaglobulinemias are caused by an excess of [[immunoglobulin M]] (IgM), and some types are caused by a deficiency in the other major types of immunoglobulins.
** ''Paraproteinemia'' or ''monoclonal gammopathy'' is the presence of excessive amounts of a single monoclonal gammaglobulin (called a ''paraprotein'') in the blood.
