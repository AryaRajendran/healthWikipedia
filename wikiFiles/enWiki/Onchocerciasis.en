In 1915, Dr. [[Rodolfo Robles]] Valverde's study on patients with river blindness in [[Guatemala]] led to the discovery that the disease is caused by filaria of ''O. volvulus'', and sheds light on the life cycle and transmission of the parasite.<ref>Marty AM, Duke BOL, Neafie RC. Onchocerciasis in Meyers, W., Neafie, RC; Marty AM; Wear DJ. Pathology of Infectious Diseases, Volume 1 Helminths, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, ISBN 1-88101041-65-4, 2000 p. 287 - 306 (17)</ref> Using case studies of coffee plantation workers in Guatemala, Robles hypothesized the vector of the disease is a day-biting insect, and more specifically, two anthropophilic species of ''[[Simulium]]'' flies found to be endemic to the areas. He published his findings on a “new disease” from Guatemala associated with [[subcutaneous]] nodules, [[anterior]] ocular (eye) lesions, [[dermatitis]], and [[microfilaria]]e in 1917.<ref>ROBLES R. Enfermedad nueva en Guatemala. La Juventud Médica 1917; 17: 97-115.</ref>

Treatment may involve the use of the drug [[ivermectin]]. For best effect, entire communities are treated at the same time. Since final hosts of ''O. volvulus'' are restricted to [[primates]], it has no major animal reservoir. A single dose may kill first-stage [[larva]]e ([[microfilaria]]e) in infected people, and it prevents transmission for many months in the remaining population.<ref name="eMedicine Onchocerciasis">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic637.htm#section~treatment |title=Onchocerciasis (River Blindness) |author=Okulicz JF |work=eMedicine |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}</ref> Other drugs are also available, including the [[tetracycline]]-class antibiotic [[doxycycline]], which kills the ''Wolbachia'' and renders the female nematodes sterile.

==Life cycle of ''O. volvulus''==
The life of the parasite can be traced through the black fly and the human hosts in the following steps:{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
# A ''Simulium'' female black fly takes a blood meal on an infected human host, and ingests microfilaria.
# The microfilaria enter the gut and thoracic flight muscles of the black fly, progressing into the first larval stage (J1.).
# The larvae mature into the second larval stage (J2.), and move to the proboscis and into the saliva in its third larval stage (J3.). Maturation takes about seven days.
# The black fly takes another blood meal, passing the larvae into the next human host’s blood.
# The larvae migrate to the subcutaneous tissue and undergo two more molts.  They form nodules as they mature into adult worms over six to 12 months.
# After maturing, adult male worms mate with female worms in the subcutaneous tissue to produce between 700 and 1,500 microfilaria per day.
# The microfilaria migrate to the skin during the day, and the black flies only feed in the day, so the parasite is in a prime position for the female fly to ingest it. Black flies take blood meals to ingest these microfilaria to restart the cycle.

==Signs and symptoms==
Adult worms remain in subcutaneous nodules, limiting access to the host's immune system.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Microfilariae, in contrast, are able to induce intense inflammatory responses, especially upon their death. Dying microfilariae have been recently discovered to release ''Wolbachia'' surface protein that activates [[TLR2]] and [[TLR4]], triggering innate immune responses and producing the inflammation and its associated morbidity.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[BMC Evol Biol]] |date=2010-02-17|pages=10:48 |title=Accelerated microevolution in an outer membrane protein (OMP) of the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia |author=Baldo L, Desjardins CA, Russell JA, Stahlhut JK, Werren JH |pmid=20163713 |pmc=2843615 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-48 |volume=10}}</ref> ''Wolbachia'' species have been found to be [[endosymbiont]]s of ''O. volvulus'' adults and microfilariae, and are thought to be the driving force behind most of ''O. volvulus'' morbidity.

Skin involvement typically consists of intense itching, swelling, and inflammation.<ref name=SSMJ>Wani, M.G. (February 2008).

*Depigmentation - 'leopard skin' appearance, usually on anterior lower leg

Ocular involvement provides the common name associated with onchocerciasis, river blindness, and may involve any part of the eye from conjunctiva and cornea to uvea and posterior segment, including the retina and optic nerve.<ref name=SSMJ /> The microfilariae migrate to the surface of the [[cornea]]. Punctate [[keratitis]] occurs in the infected area. This clears up as the inflammation subsides. However, if the infection is chronic, sclerosing keratitis can occur, making the affected area become [[opacity (optics)|opaque]]. Over time, the entire cornea may become opaque, thus leading to blindness. Some evidence suggests the effect on the cornea is caused by an immune response to bacteria present in the worms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. The skin is itchy, with severe rashes permanently damaging patches of skin.

The Mazzotti reaction, first described in 1948, is a symptom complex seen in patients after undergoing treatment of onchocerciasis with the medication [[diethylcarbamazine]] (DEC). Mazzotti  reactions can be life-threatening, and are characterized by [[fever]], [[urticaria]], [[Lymphadenopathy|swollen and tender lymph nodes]], [[tachycardia]], [[hypotension]], [[arthralgias]], [[oedema]], and [[abdominal pain]] that occur within seven days of treatment of microfilariasis. The phenomenon is so common when DEC is used, this drug is the basis of a [[Patch test (medicine)|skin patch test]] used to confirm that diagnosis. The drug patch is placed on the skin, and if the patient is infected with ''O. volvulus'' microfilaria, localized [[pruritus]] and urticaria are seen at the application site.<ref>http://microblog.me.uk/420</ref>

==Prevention==
Various control programs aim to stop onchocerciasis from being a [[public health]] problem. The first was the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP), which was launched in 1974, and at its peak, covered 30 million people in 11 countries. Through the use of [[larvicide]] spraying of fast-flowing rivers to control black fly populations, and from 1988 onwards, the use of ivermectin to treat infected people, the OCP eliminated onchocerciasis as a public health problem. The OCP, a joint effort of the World Health Organisation, the [[World Bank]], the [[United Nations Development Programme]], and the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], was considered to be a success, and came to an end in 2002. Continued monitoring ensures onchocerciasis cannot reinvade the area of the OCP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/blindness/partnerships/onchocerciasis_OCP/en/index.html |title=Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |work=Programmes and Projects |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>

In 1992, the Onchocerciasis Elimination Programme for the Americas, which also relies on ivermectin, was launched.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/blindness/partnerships/onchocerciasis_oepa/en/index.html |title=Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (OEPA) |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |work=Programmes and Projects |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>

In 1995, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control began covering another 19 countries, mainly relying upon the use of ivermectin. Its goal is to set up a community-directed supply of ivermectin for those who are infected. In these ways, transmission has declined.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/blindness/partnerships/APOC/en/index.html |title=African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |work=Programmes and Projects |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>

No vaccine to prevent onchocerciasis infection is available.

A vaccine to prevent onchocerciasis infection for cattle is in phase three trials.  Cattle injected with a modified and weakened form of O. ochengi larvae have developed very high levels of protection against infection.  The findings suggest that it could be possible to develop a vaccine that protects people against river blindness using a similar approach.  Unfortunately, a  vaccine to protect humans is still many years off.

==Treatment==
[[File:68-4062-1 (ATED).jpg|thumb|The burden of onchocerciasis: children leading blind adults in Africa]]
In mass drug administration (MDA) programmes, the treatment for onchocerciasis is [[ivermectin]] (trade name: Mectizan); infected people can be treated with two doses of ivermectin, six months apart, repeated every three years. The drug paralyses and kills the microfilariae causing fever, itching, and possibly oedema, arthritis and lymphadenopathy. Intense skin itching is eventually relieved, and the progression towards blindness is halted. In addition, while the drug does not kill the adult worm, it does prevent them from producing additional offspring. The drug therefore prevents both morbidity and transmission.

Ivermectin treatment is particularly effective because it only needs to be taken once or twice a year, needs no refrigeration, and has a wide margin of safety, with the result that it has been widely given by minimally trained community health workers.<ref name="amsci2010">{{cite journal |title=Ivermectin and River Blindness |author=Rea PA, Zhang V, Baras YS |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=294–303 |year=2010 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2010/4/ivermectin-and-river-blindness}}</ref>

===Antibiotics===
For the treatment of individuals, [[doxycycline]] is used to kill the ''[[Wolbachia]]'' bacteria that live in adult worms. This adjunct therapy has been shown to significantly lower microfilarial loads in the host, and may have activity against the adult worms, due to the symbiotic relationship between ''Wolbachia'' and the worm.<ref>{{cite book |author=Trattler, Bill; Gladwin, Mark |title=Clinical Microbiology Made Ridiculously Simple |publisher=MedMaster |location=Miami |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-940780-81-X |oclc=156907378 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16230105">{{cite journal |author=Taylor MJ, Bandi C, Hoerauf A |title=Wolbachia bacterial endosymbionts of filarial nematodes |journal=[[Adv.

===Ivermectin===
[[Ivermectin]] kills the parasite by interfering with the nervous system and muscle function, in particular, by enhancing inhibitory [[neurotransmission]]. The drug binds to and activates [[glutamate-gated chloride channel]]s.<ref name="amsci2010"/> These channels, present in [[neurons]] and [[myocytes]], are not [[invertebrate]]-specific, but are protected in [[vertebrates]] from the action of ivermectin by the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref name="amsci2010"/> Ivermectin is thought to irreversibly activate these channel receptors in the worm, eventually causing an [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential]]. The chance of a future [[action potential]] occurring in synapses between neurons decreases and the nematodes experience [[flaccid paralysis]] followed by death.<ref name="sciencedirect.com">{{cite journal |author=Yates DM, Wolstenholme AJ |title=An ivermectin-sensitive glutamate-gated chloride channel subunit from Dirofilaria immitis |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |volume=34 |issue=9 |date=August 2004 |pages=1075–81 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2004.04.010 |pmid=15313134}}</ref><ref name="parasitology.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de">{{cite journal |author=Harder A |title=Chemotherapeutic approaches to nematodes: current knowledge and outlook |journal=Parasitology Research |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=272–7 |doi=10.1007/s00436-001-0535-x |pmid=11954915 |year=2002}}</ref><ref name="pmid17608971">{{cite journal |journal=Parasitology |year=2005 |volume=131 |issue=Suppl:S85–95 |title=Glutamate-gated chloride channels and the mode of action of the avermectin/milbemycin anthelmintics |author=Wolstenholme AJ, Rogers AT |pmid=16569295 |pages=S85–95 |doi=10.1017/S0031182005008218}}</ref>

Ivermectin is directly effective against the larval stage microfilariae  of ''O. volvulus''; they are paralyzed and can be killed by [[eosinophils]] and [[macrophages]]. It does not kill adult females (macrofilariae), but does cause them to cease releasing microfilariae, perhaps by paralyzing the reproductive tract.<ref name="amsci2010"/>

Since 1988, ivermectin has been provided free of charge for use in humans by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] through the Mectizan donation program (MDP). The MDP works together with ministries of health and nongovernmental development organisations, such as the [[World Health Organization]], to provide free ivermectin to those who need it in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas.<ref name="pmid18419585">{{cite journal |journal=[[Trop Med Int Health]] |date=2008 May |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=689–96 |title=Operational lessons from 20 years of the Mectizan Donation Program for the control of onchocerciasis |author=Thylefors B, Alleman MM, Twum-Danso NA |pmid=18419585 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02049.x}}</ref>

Another 120 million people are at risk for contracting the disease. Due to the vector’s breeding habitat, the disease is more severe along the major rivers in the northern and central areas of the continent, and severity declines in villages farther from rivers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Travelers who do not stay long in those areas have little risk of developing the disease, as it requires prolonged exposure to the fly bites and parasite introduction.

According to a 2002 [[WHO]] report, onchocerciasis has not caused a single death, but its global burden is 987,000 [[disability adjusted life year]]s (DALYs).  The severe [[pruritus]] alone accounts for 60% of the DALYs. Infection reduces the host’s immunity and resistance to other diseases, which results in an estimated reduction in life expectancy of 13 years.<ref name="stan"/>

==Research==
Animal models for the disease are somewhat limited, as the parasite only lives in primates, but there are close parallels. ''Litomosoides sigmodontis '', which will naturally infect [[cotton rat]]s, has been found to fully develop in [[BALB/c]] mice. ''[[Onchocerca ochengi]]'', the closest relative of ''O. volvulus'', lives in intradermal cavities in cattle, and is also spread by black flies. Both systems are useful, but not exact, animal models.<ref name="pmid18446236">{{cite journal |author=Allen JE, Adjei O, Bain O, Hoerauf A, Hoffmann WH, Makepeace BL, Schulz-Key H, Tanya VN, Trees AJ, Wanji S, Taylor DW |title=Of Mice, Cattle, and Humans: The Immunology and Treatment of River Blindness |journal=[[PLoS Negl Trop Dis]] |volume=2 |issue=4 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18446236 |pmc=2323618 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000217 |pages=e217 |editor1-last=Lustigman |editor1-first=Sara}}</ref>
