An '''anticarcinogen''' is any chemical which reduces the occurrence of [[cancer]]s, reduces the severity of cancers that do occur, or acts against cancers that do occur, based on evidence from ''[[in vitro]]'' studies, animal models, [[epidemiological]] studies and/or [[clinical study|clinical studies]].

'''Preventative anticarcinogens''' act by enhancing an organism's natural defenses against cancer, by deactivating [[carcinogen]]s or by blocking the mechanisms by which carcinogens act (such as [[free radical]] damage to [[DNA]]). 

'''Anticarcinoma agents''' participate in the selective destruction of cancer cells, or inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. ''See also: [[Chemotherapy]].''

Interest in preventative anticarcinogens is motivated primarily by the principle that it is preferable to prevent disease where possible, and that positive actions can be effective as well as negative ones (such as reducing exposure to known [[carcinogen]]s). Anticarcinoma agents that do not have significant negative side effects have a similar potential role, by reducing the seriousness of any cancers that do occur.

==Known anticarcinogens==

There is epidemiological evidence that a diet rich in antioxidant [[vitamin]]s and [[flavonoid]]s is anticarcinogenic. Interest in many popular nutritional supplements, including essential [[antioxidant]] nutrients such as [[selenium]] compounds and hormones such as [[melatonin]] and [[DHEA]], is partly motivated by evidence that these have significant anticarcinogenic effects in appropriate quantities.  The major psychoactive component in [[marijuana]], [[tetrahydrocannabinol]], has been shown to have anticarcinogenic activity, when injected into mice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chan PC, Sills RC, Braun AG, Haseman JK, Bucher JR |title=Toxicity and carcinogenicity of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol in Fischer rats and B6C3F1 mice |journal=Fundamental and applied toxicology : official journal of the Society of Toxicology |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=109â€“17 |year=1996 |pmid=8812248 |doi=10.1006/faat.1996.0048}}</ref>  The other major component of [[cannabis]] - [[cannabidiol]], has also been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth, with low potency in non-cancer cells. Although the inhibitory mechanism is not yet fully understood, Ligresti et al. suggest that "cannabidiol exerts its effects on these cells through a combination of mechanisms that include either direct or indirect activation of [[cannabinoid receptor 2|CB<sub>2</sub>]] and [[TRPV1]] receptors, and induction of [[oxidative stress]], all contributing to induce [[apoptosis]].".<ref name=cancerinhibition>{{cite journal
