'''Low-carbohydrate diets''' or '''low-carb diets''' are dietary programs that restrict [[carbohydrate]] consumption, often for the [[Management of obesity|treatment]] of [[obesity]]. Foods high in easily digestible carbohydrates (e.g., [[sugar]], [[bread]], [[pasta]]) are limited or replaced with foods containing a higher percentage of  [[fat]]s and moderate protein (e.g., [[meat]], [[poultry]], [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[shellfish]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[cheese]], [[Nut (fruit)#Nutritional benefits|nuts]], and [[List of edible seeds|seeds]]) and other foods low in carbohydrates (e.g., most [[Salad#Vegetable salad|salad vegetables]]), although other [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]]s (especially [[berry|berries]]) are often allowed. The amount of carbohydrate allowed varies with different low-carbohydrate diets.

Such diets are sometimes ''[[ketogenic]]'' (i.e., they restrict carbohydrate intake sufficiently to cause [[ketosis]]).

==History==
===Prehistory===
{{see also|Paleolithic#Diet and nutrition|label 1=Paleolithic: Diet and nutrition}}
As with the [[paleolithic diet]], several advocates of low-carbohydrate diets have argued that these diets are closer to the ancestral diet of humans before the [[origin of agriculture]], and therefore that humans are [[Adaptation|genetically adapted]] to diets low in carbohydrate.<ref name = "Taubes2011">{{Cite book| last = Taubes, Gary| title = [[Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It]]|publisher = Anchor Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-307-59551-5 | pages = 164–167 | year = 2011}}</ref> Direct archaeological or fossil evidence on nutrition during the [[Paleolithic]], when all humans subsisted by [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]], is limited, but suggests that humans evolved from the vegetarian diets common to other [[Hominidae|great apes]] to one with a greater level of meat eating.<ref name="Richards 2000">{{Cite doi|10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601646}}</ref> Some close relatives of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', such as the [[Neanderthal]]s, appear to have been almost exclusively [[carnivorous]].<ref name="Fiorenza et al 2011">{{Cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0014769}}</ref>

A more detailed picture of early human diets before the origin of agriculture may be obtained by analogy to contemporary hunter-gatherers. According to one survey of these societies, a relatively low carbohydrate (22–40% of total energy), animal food-centered diet is preferred "whenever and wherever it [is] ecologically possible", and where plant foods do predominate, carbohydrate consumption remains low because wild plants are much lower in carbohydrate and higher in [[Dietary fiber|fiber]] than modern [[Domestication#Plants|domesticated]] [[crop]]s.<ref name="Cordain et al 2000">{{Cite pmid|10702160}}</ref> Primatologist Katherine Milton, however, has argued that the survey data on which this conclusion is based inflates the animal content of typical hunter-gatherer diets; much of it was based on early [[ethnography]], which may have overlooked the role of women in gathering plant foods.<ref name="Milton 2000">{{Cite pmid|10702155}}</ref> She has also highlighted the diversity of both ancestral and contemporary [[foraging]] diets, arguing that there is no evidence that humans are especially adapted to a single paleolithic diet over and above the vegetarian diets characteristic of the last thirty million years of primate evolution.<ref name="Milton 2002">{{cite book| last = Milton, Katharine| editor = Ungar, Peter S. & Teaford, Mark F.| title = Human Diet: Its Origins and Evolution| year = 2002  | publisher = Bergin and Garvey  | location = [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport, CT]]| isbn = 0-89789-736-6 | pages = 111–22| chapter = Hunter-gatherer diets: wild foods signal relief from diseases of affluence (PDF)| chapterurl = http://nature.berkeley.edu/miltonlab/pdfs/humandiet.pdf}}</ref>

===Early dietary science===
In 1797, John Rollo reported on the results of treating two [[diabetic]] Army officers with a low-carbohydrate diet and medications. A very low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet was the standard treatment for diabetes throughout the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morgan |first=William |title=Diabetes mellitus: its history, chemistry, anatomy, pathology, physiology, and treatment |year=1877 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1CIDAAAAQAAJ}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Einhorn |first=Max |title=Lectures on dietetics |year=1905 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=utZqUyKmffIC}}</ref>

In 1863, [[William Banting]], a formerly obese English undertaker and coffin maker, published "Letter on Corpulence Addressed to the Public", in which he described a diet for weight control giving up [[bread]], [[butter]], [[milk]], [[sugar]], [[beer]] and [[potatoes]].<ref name=Banting>{{Cite book|url=http://2020ok.com/books/25/letter-on-corpulence-addressed-to-the-public-19925.htm |title = Letter On Corpulence, Addressed to the Public |author=William Banting |publisher= Harrison |location=London, England |year=1869 |edition=4th |accessdate=2008-01-02}}</ref> His booklet was widely read, so much so that some people used the term "Banting" for the activity usually called "[[dieting]]".<ref name=Groves>{{cite web| url=http://www.westonaprice.org/knowyourfats/banting.html |title=William Banting Father of the Low-Carbohydrate Diet |author=Barry Groves |publisher= The [[Weston A.

In 1888, [[James Salisbury]] introduced the [[Salisbury steak]] as part of his high-meat diet, which limited vegetables, fruit, starches, and fats to one-third of the diet.

===Modern low-carbohydrate diets===
In 1967, Irwin Stillman published ''[[Stillman diet|The Doctor's Quick Weight Loss Diet]]''. The "Stillman Diet" is a [[high-protein diet|high-protein]], low-carbohydrate and [[low-fat diet]]. It is regarded as one of the first low-carbohydrate diets to become popular in the [[United States]].<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_6_19/ai_102140891 1967: the Stillman diet – History Of Diets, Part 12 – protein diet] Men's Fitness.

''Life Without Bread''. McGraw-Hill; 2000. ISBN 978-0-658-00170-3. English language, 1st Ed.</ref> However, it was not well known in the [[English-speaking world]].

In 1972, [[Robert Atkins (nutritionist)|Robert Atkins]] published ''[[Atkins Diet|Dr. Atkins Diet Revolution]]'', which advocated a low-carbohydrate diet that he had successfully used in treating patients in the 1960s (having developed the diet from a 1963 article published in ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'').<ref name="The History of the Atkins Diet‚ A Revolutionary Lifestyle">[http://www.e-clipse.com/articles_history.htm The History of the Atkins Diet‚ A Revolutionary Lifestyle]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> The book met with some success, but, because of research at that time suggesting risk factors associated with excess fat and protein, it was widely criticized by the mainstream medical community as being dangerous and misleading, thereby limiting its appeal at the time.<ref>''[http://www.atkinsexposed.org/atkins/75/American_Medical_Association.htm A critique of low-carbohydrate ketogenic weight reduction regimens. A review of Dr. Atkins' diet revolution.]'', Journal of the American Medical Association, 1973</ref> Among other things, critics pointed out that Atkins had done little real research into his theories and based them mostly on his clinical work. Later that decade, Walter Voegtlin and Herman Tarnower published books advocating the [[paleolithic diet]] and [[Scarsdale diet]], respectively, each meeting with moderate success.<ref name="isbn0533013143">{{Cite book|last=Voegtlin |first=Walter L. |title=The stone age diet: Based on in-depth studies of human ecology and the diet of man |year=1975 |publisher=Vantage Press |isbn=0-533-01314-3}}</ref>

The concept of the [[glycemic index]] was developed in 1981 by David Jenkins to account for variances in speed of digestion of different types of carbohydrates. This concept classifies foods according to the rapidity of their effect on [[blood sugar]] levels{{spaced ndash}}with fast digesting [[simple carbohydrate]]s causing a sharper increase and slower digesting [[complex carbohydrate]]s such as [[whole grain]]s a slower one.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6259925 |year=1981 |last1=Jenkins |first1=DJ |last2=Wolever |first2=TM |last3=Taylor |first3=RH |last4=Barker |first4=H |last5=Fielden |first5=H |last6=Baldwin |first6=JM |last7=Bowling |first7=AC |last8=Newman |first8=HC |last9=Jenkins |first9=AL |title=Glycemic index of foods: A physiological basis for carbohydrate exchange |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=362–6 |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}</ref> The concept has been extended to include the amount of carbohydrate actually absorbed as well, as a tablespoonful of cooked [[carrot]]s is less significant overall than a large baked potato (effectively pure [[starch]], which is efficiently absorbed as glucose), despite differences in glycemic index.

In the 1990s, Atkins published ''Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution'', and other doctors began to publish books based on the same principles. This has been said to be the beginning of what the mass media call the "low carb craze" in the [[United States]].<ref name="PBS News Hour: Low Carb Craze">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/jan-june04/carb_04-23.html |title=PBS News Hour: Low Carb Craze |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}</ref> During the late 1990s and early 2000s, low-carbohydrate diets became some of the most popular diets in the US.

Many of the diet guides and gurus that appeared at this time intentionally distanced themselves from Atkins and the term ''low carb'' (because of the controversies), even though their recommendations were based on largely the same principles (e.g., the [[Zone diet]]).<ref>Sears, Barry; Lawren, Bill: ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=fewLJwAACAAJ&dq=%22The+zone%22 Enter the Zone]'', Regan Books, 1995, 352 pp, ISBN 0-06-039150-2</ref><ref>Brand-Miller, Jennie; Foster-Powell, Kaye; McMillan-Price, Joanna: ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=cUz1wJMlGDkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22The+low+GI+diet+Revolution%22&sig=MEWxsMmVc_49o_V9wY5x3AouzeM#PPR3,M1 The Low GI Diet Revolution: The Definitive Science-Based Weight Loss Plan]'', Marlowe & Company, 30 November 2004, 336 pp, ISBN 978-1-56924-413-5</ref> As a result, it is often a matter of debate which diets are really low-carbohydrate and which are not. The 1990s and 2000s also saw the publication of an increased number of clinical studies regarding the effectiveness and safety (pro and con) of low-carbohydrate diets (see [[Medical research related to low-carbohydrate diets|low-carbohydrate diet medical research]]).

In the United States, the popularity of the low-carb diet trend waned somewhat in the late 2000s. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Despite the decline in popularity, this diet trend has continued to quietly garner attention in the medical and nutritional science communities, and also inspired a number of hybrid diets that include traditional calorie-counting and exercise regimens.<ref name="Diabetes Group Backs Low-Carb Diets"/><ref name="epilepsy.com"/><ref>Rosen, Evan David: ''[http://www.defeatdiabetes.org/Articles/diet030618.htm Weighing In On the Low Carb Diet Controversy]'', Defeat Diabetes Foundation, 18 June 2003</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Burros |first=Marian |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EFDE1239F932A15752C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title= Eating Well; The Post-Atkins Low Carb Diet |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date=21 January 2004 |accessdate=19 December 2010 }}</ref> Other popular low-carb diets focus on the removal of certain foods from the diet, such as sugar and grain.

==Practices and theories==
Today, the term "low-carbohydrate diet" is most strongly associated with the [[Atkins Diet]] and other diets that share similar principles. The [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] defines low-carbohydrate diets as diets that restrict carbohydrate intake to 20 to 60 grams per day, typically less than 20 percent of caloric intake.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Last AR, Wilson SA |title=Low-carbohydrate diets |journal=American Family Physician |volume=73 |issue=11 |pages=1942–8 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16770923 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=16770923}}</ref> Some low-carbohydrate diets may exceed one or more of these definitions, notably the maintenance phase of the Atkins Diet. There is no consensus definition of what precisely constitutes a low-carbohydrate diet. Medical researchers and diet advocates may define different levels of carbohydrate intake when specifying low-carbohydrate diets. For the purposes of this discussion, this article focuses on diets that reduce (nutritive) [[carbohydrate]] intake sufficiently to significantly reduce [[insulin]] production and to encourage [[ketosis]] (production of [[ketone]]s to be used as energy in place of glucose).

The body of research underpinning low-carbohydrate diets has grown significantly in the decades of the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>[[Ann Louise Gittleman]]: ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jk2VJbUyEasC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=%22protein+power%22+chapter&source=web&ots=ddPrO-HmU5&sig=ftu-PZRcYvLbVLaVea6vpy3pjsw&hl=en#PPA53,M1 Eat Fat, Lose Weight]'', Chapter 5, McGraw Hill, 11 March 1999, ISBN 0-87983-966-X / 9780879839666</ref><ref>Eades, Michael R.; Eades, Mary Dan: ''Protein Power'', Chapter 1, Bantam Books, 1999, ISBN 0-553-38078-8</ref> Most of this research centers on the relationship between carbohydrate intake and [[blood sugar]] levels (i.e., blood [[glucose]]), as well as some related [[hormone]] levels. Some evidence suggests blood sugar levels in the human body should be maintained in a fairly narrow range to maintain good health. The two primary hormones that regulate blood sugar levels are [[insulin]], which lowers blood sugar levels, and [[glucagon]], which raises blood sugar levels.<ref>''[http://www.endocrineweb.com/insulin.html Normal Regulation of Blood Glucose]'', EndocrineWeb.com, retrieved 12 March 2008</ref> These are both produced in the [[pancreas]]: insulin from [[beta cell]]s and glucagon from alpha cells.

In [[western world|western]] diets (and many others), most meals are sufficiently high in nutritive carbohydrates to evoke insulin secretion. The primary control for this insulin secretion is glucose in the blood stream, typically from digested carbohydrate. Insulin also controls [[ketosis]]; in the non-ketotic state, the human body stores dietary fat in fat cells (i.e., adipose tissue) and preferentially uses glucose as cellular fuel. Diets low in nutritive carbohydrates introduce less glucose into the blood stream and thus evoke less insulin secretion, which leads to longer and more frequent episodes of ketosis. Some research suggests that this causes body fat to be eliminated from the body, although this theory remains controversial, insofar as it refers to excretion of lipids (i.e., fat and oil) and not to fat metabolism during ketosis.<ref>{{cite web | title = Study questions long-term Atkins effects  | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 4 September 2004 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200409/s1192092.htm | archivedate = 11 December 2011 | archiveurl=http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200409/s1192092.htm}}</ref>

This means sharply reducing consumption of desserts, breads, pastas, potatoes, rice, and other sweet or starchy foods. Some recommend levels less than 20&nbsp;grams of "net carbs" per day, at least in the early stages of dieting<ref>''[http://carbstation.com/Clayton/blog/the-atkins-diet/]'', Carbstation.com, retrieved 25 January 2011</ref> (for comparison, a single slice of white bread typically contains 15&nbsp;grams of carbohydrate, almost entirely starch). By contrast, the [[Institute of Medicine|U.S. Institute of Medicine]] recommends a minimum intake of 130&nbsp;grams of carbohydrate per day (the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] and [[World Health Organization|WHO]] similarly recommend that the majority of dietary energy come from carbohydrates).<ref>Food and Nutrition Board (2002/2005).

Low-carbohydrate diets often differ in the specific amount of carbohydrate intake allowed, whether certain types of foods are preferred, whether occasional exceptions are allowed, etc. Generally they all agree that processed sugar should be eliminated, or at the very least greatly reduced, and similarly generally discourage heavily processed grains (white bread, etc.). Low-carbohydrate diets vary greatly in their recommendations as to the amount of fat allowed in the diet. The [[Atkins Diet]] does not limit fat. Others recommend a moderate fat intake.

Although low-carbohydrate diets are most commonly discussed as a weight-loss approach, some experts have proposed using low-carbohydrate diets to mitigate or prevent diseases including diabetes, metabolic disease and epilepsy.<ref name="Yancy 2005 34">{{Cite journal|author=Yancy WS, Foy M, Chalecki AM, Vernon MC, Westman EC |title=A low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet to treat type 2 diabetes |journal=Nutrition & Metabolism |volume=2 |issue= 1|page=34 |year=2005 |pmid=16318637 |pmc=1325029 |doi=10.1186/1743-7075-2-34}}</ref><ref>John M.

There is also a category of diets known as [[glycemic index|low-glycemic-index diets]] (low-GI diets) or low-glycemic-load diets (low-GL diets), in particular the Low GI Diet by Brand-Miller et al.<ref>Brand-Miller et al. (2005). The Low GI Diet Revolution: The Definitive Science-based Weight Loss Plan. Marlowe & Company. New York, NY</ref> In reality, low-carbohydrate diets can also be low-GL diets (and vice versa) depending on the carbohydrates in a particular diet. In practice, though, "low-GI"/"low-GL" diets differ from "low-carb" diets in the following ways. First, low-carbohydrate diets treat all nutritive carbohydrates as having the same effect on metabolism, and generally assume that their effect is predictable. Low-GI/low-GL diets are based on the measured change in blood glucose levels in various carbohydrates – these vary markedly in laboratory studies. The differences are due to poorly understood digestive differences between foods. However, as foods influence digestion in complex ways (e.g., both protein and fat delay absorption of glucose from carbohydrates eaten at the same time) it is difficult to even approximate the glycemic effect (e.g., over time or even in total in some cases) of a particular meal.

Another related diet type, the [[Insulin index|low-insulin-index diet]], is similar except that it is based on measurements of direct insulemic responses (i.e., the amount of [[insulin]] in the bloodstream) to food rather than glycemic response (the amount of [[glucose]] in the bloodstream). Although such diet recommendations mostly involve lowering nutritive carbohydrates, there are some low-carbohydrate foods that are discouraged as well (e.g., beef).<ref>{{Cite journal| author=SH Holt, JC Miller and P Petocz | title=An insulin index of foods: the insulin demand generated by 1000-kJ portions of common foods | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | date=1 November 1997| volume=66 | url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/5/1264 | pages=1264–1276 | pmid=9356547 | issue=5 }}</ref> Insulin secretion is stimulated (though less strongly) by other dietary intake. Like glycemic index diets, there is difficulty predicting the insulin secretion from any particular meal, due to assorted digestive interactions and so differing effects on insulin release.

==Ketosis and insulin synthesis: what is normal?==
At the heart of the debate about most low carbohydrate diets are fundamental questions about what is a ''normal'' diet and how the human body is supposed to operate. These questions can be outlined as follows:

The diets of most people in modern [[western world|Western]] nations, especially the [[United States]], contain large amounts of [[starch]]es and often substantial amounts of [[sugar]]s, including [[fructose]]. Most westerners seldom exhaust stored [[glycogen]] supplies and hence rarely go into [[ketosis]]. This has been regarded by the majority of the medical community in the last century as normal for humans.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Ketosis had been confused with [[ketoacidosis]], a dangerous and extreme ketotic condition associated with diabetes, and had been regarded by the medical community as harmful and potentially life-threatening, who believe it unnecessarily stresses the liver and causes destruction of muscle tissues.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} A perception developed that getting energy chiefly from dietary protein rather than carbohydrates causes liver damage and that getting energy chiefly from dietary fats rather than carbohydrates causes [[coronary heart disease|heart disease]] and other health problems. This view is still held by the majority of those in the medical and nutritional science communities.<ref>''[http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/High-Protein-Diets_UCM_305989_Article.jsp#.T0o_cxyq0bw High-Protein Diets]'', American Heart Association, 14 March 2008</ref><ref>''[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/SPC/content/SPC_1_A_Low_Carb_Diet_to_Prevent_Cancer.asp Weighing In on Low-Carb Diets]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}'', The American Cancer Society, retrieved 12 March 2008</ref><ref>Karra, Cindy: ''[http://www.shapeup.org/about/arch_pr/122903.php Shape Up America! Reveals The Truth About Dieters]'', Shape Up America! (by former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop), 29 December 2003</ref> However, it is now widely recognized that periodic ketosis is in fact normal, and that ketosis provides a number of surprising benefits, including neuroprotection against diverse types of cellular injury.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16940764 |year=2006 |last1=Gasior |first1=M |last2=Rogawski |first2=MA |last3=Hartman |first3=AL |title=Neuroprotective and disease-modifying effects of the ketogenic diet |volume=17 |issue=5–6 |pages=431–9 |pmc=2367001 |journal=Behavioural Pharmacology |doi=10.1097/00008877-200609000-00009}}</ref>

People who eschew low carbohydrate diets cite [[hypoglycemia]] and [[ketoacidosis]] as a risk factor. While mild acidosis may be a side effect when beginning a ketogenic diet,<ref name="Hartman2007">{{cite journal |author=Hartman AL, Vining EP |title=Clinical aspects of the ketogenic diet |journal=[[Epilepsia]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=31–42 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17241206 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.00914.x |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Delbridge E, Proietto J|title=State of the science: VLED (Very Low Energy Diet) for obesity|journal=Asia Pac J Clin Nutr|year=2006|volume=15|pages=49–54|pmid=16928661|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16928661|first1=E|last2=Proietto|first2=J}}</ref> it is benign and should not be confused with diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be life threatening.

A diet very low in starches and sugars induces several adaptive responses. Low blood glucose causes the pancreas to produce [[glucagon]],<ref>Carr, Timothy P.: ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=z3Qp2z2ByV4C&pg=PA194&dq=glucagon+glycogen+ketone&sig=HWX132ylv-Es3A_LUPKWdxD-OHc#PPA72,M1 Discovering Nutrition]'', Chapter 7, Blackwell Publishing, October 2002, ISBN 978-0-632-04564-8</ref> which stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the blood. When liver glycogen stores are exhausted, the body starts utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose. The [[brain]] cannot use fatty acids for energy, and instead uses ketones produced from fatty acids by the liver. By using fatty acids and ketones as energy sources, supplemented by conversion of proteins to glucose ([[gluconeogenesis]]), the body can maintain normal levels of blood glucose without dietary carbohydrates.

Most advocates of low-carbohydrate diets, such as the Atkins Diet, argue that the human body is adapted to function primarily in ketosis.<ref>{{cite web |last=Eades |first=Michael R. |url=http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/intermittent-fasting/protein-power-verses-intermittent-fasting/ |title=Protein Power verses Intermittent Fasting |publisher=proteinpower.com |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=19 December 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Morrison |first=Katharine |url=http://www.dsolve.com/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,13/Itemid,27/ |title=Dietary Carbohydrate, Protein and Fat for People With Glucose Metabolism Disorders. Just What is Optimal? |publisher= D-Solve: Low Carb & Low Insulin Diabetes Management |date=February 2005 }}</ref> They argue that high insulin levels can cause many health problems, most significantly fat storage and weight gain. They argue that the purported dangers of ketosis are unsubstantiated (some of the arguments against ketosis result from confusion between ketosis and [[ketoacidosis]] which is a mostly diabetic condition unrelated to dieting or low-carbohydrate intake).<ref>Dolson, Laura: ''[http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/faq/f/whatisketosis.htm What is Ketosis?]'', About.com: Low Carb Diets, retrieved 13 March 2008</ref> They also argue that fat in the diet only contributes to heart disease in the presence of high insulin levels and that if the diet is instead adjusted to induce ketosis, fat and cholesterol in the diet are beneficial. Most low carb diets plans discourage consumption of [[trans fat]]).

On a high-carbohydrate diet, glucose is used by cells in the body for the energy needed for their basic functions, and about 2/3 of body cells require insulin in order to use glucose. Excessive amounts of blood glucose are thought to be a primary cause of the complications of diabetes; when glucose reacts with body proteins (resulting in glycosolated proteins) and change their behavior. Perhaps for this reason, the amount of glucose tightly maintained in the blood is quite low. Unless a meal is very low in starches and sugars, blood glucose will rise for a period of an hour or two after a meal. When this occurs, beta cells in the [[pancreas]] release insulin to cause uptake of glucose into cells. In liver and muscle cells, more glucose is taken in than is needed and stored as [[glycogen]] (once called 'animal starch').<ref>Bowen, R.: ''[http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/pancreas/index.html The Endocrine Pancreas]'', Colorado State University: Hypertexts for Biomedical Sciences, 8 December 2002</ref> Diets with a high starch/sugar content, therefore, cause release of more insulin and so more cell absorption. In diabetics, glucose levels vary in time with meals and vary a little more as a result of high carbohydrate content meals. In non-diabetics, blood sugar levels are restored to normal levels within an hour or two, regardless of the content of a meal.

While there are [[essential fatty acid]]s (EFA) and [[essential amino acid]]s (EAA) and while a diet devoid of EFA or EAA will result in eventual death, a diet completely without carbohydrates can be maintained indefinitely because fatty acids include a carbohydrate backbone ([[glycerol]]).<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=19083495 |year=2008 |last1=Grieb |first1=P |last2=Kłapcińska |first2=B |last3=Smol |first3=E |last4=Pilis |first4=T |last5=Pilis |first5=W |last6=Sadowska-Krepa |first6=E |last7=Sobczak |first7=A |last8=Bartoszewicz |first8=Z |last9=Nauman |first9=J |title=Long-term consumption of a carbohydrate-restricted diet does not induce deleterious metabolic effects |volume=28 |issue=12 |pages=825–33 |doi=10.1016/j.nutres.2008.09.011 |journal=Nutrition research}}</ref> There are essential fatty acids and amino acids for structural building blocks, not energy. EFA and EAA will be converted into intermediates for the carbohydrate metabolism, even if it depletes their essential stocks. However, a very low carbohydrate diet (less than 20g per day) may negatively affect certain biomarkers<ref>Arizona State University (17 December 2007). Researchers Nix Low-carb Diet. ScienceDaily. Retrieved 15 April 2011, from http://www.sciencedaily.com­/releases/2007/12/071217150506.htm</ref> and produce detrimental effects in certain types of individuals (for instance, those with kidney problems). The opposite is also true – for instance, clinical experience suggests very low carbohydrate diet for patients with [[metabolic syndrome]].<ref>Clinical use of a Carbohydrate-Restricted Diet to Treat the Dyslipidemia of the Metabolic Syndrome [http://www.drjosephhickey.com/pdfs/Hickey%20low%20carb%20research.pdf]</ref>

This study, however, has been met with criticism, due to the unreliability of the self-administered food frequency questionnaire, as compared to food journaling,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ije/18.4.858 |title=Food-Based Validation of a Dietary Questionnaire: The Effects of Week-to-Week Variation in Food Consumption |year=1989 |last1=Salvini |first1=Simonetta |last2=Hunter |first2=David J |last3=Sampson |first3=Laura |last4=Stampfer |first4=Meir J |last5=Colditz |first5=Graham A |last6=Rosner |first6=Bernard |last7=Willett |first7=Walter C |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=858–67 |pmid=2621022}}</ref> as well as classifying "low-carbohydrate" diets based on comparisons to the group as a whole (decile method) rather than surveying dieters following established low-carb dietary guidelines like the Atkins or Paleo diet.<ref>{{cite web|last=Minger|first=Denise|title=Brand-Spankin’ New Study: Are Low-Carb Meat Eaters in Trouble?|url=http://rawfoodsos.com/2010/09/08/brand-spankin-new-study-are-low-carb-meat-eaters-in-trouble/|work=Raw Food SOS|accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref>

==Opinions from major governmental and medical organizations==
Although opinions regarding low-carbohydrate diets vary greatly throughout the medical and nutritional science communities, major government bodies as well as major medical and nutritional associations have generally opposed this nutritional regimen. In recent years, however, some{{who|date=November 2012}} of these same organizations have gradually begun to relax their opposition to the point that some have even voiced cautious support for low-carbohydrate diets{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}. The following are official statements from some of these organizations.
;American Academy of Family Physicians
The [[American Academy of Family Physicians|AAFP]] released a ''discussion paper'' on the Atkins Diet specifically in 2006. Although the paper expresses reservations about the Atkins plan they acknowledge it as a legitimate weight loss approach.<ref>Rebecca K. Kirby: ''[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/clinical/publichealth/nutrition/atkinsdiet.html Atkins' Diet – Discussion Paper]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}'', [http://www.aafp.org/ AAFP], 2006. The paper states
:''... a major problem with them is that many persons attempting to follow a low-carbohydrate regimen do not eat a variety of fruits and vegetables ...''
:...
:''A low dietary glycemic load also has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.''
:...
:''Normal kidney function does not seem to preclude a high-protein diet, but the long-term effects on bone status are unclear.''
:...
:''Because of our diverse health requirements and inherent biochemical individuality, some people will do better on low-fat diets and some people will do better on low-carb diets.''</ref>
;American Diabetes Association
The [[American Diabetes Association|ADA]] revised their ''Nutrition Recommendations and Interventions for Diabetes'' in 2008 to acknowledge low-carbohydrate diets as a legitimate weight-loss plan.<ref>[http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/vol31/suppl_1/#SUMMARY_OF_REVISIONS ADA Nutrition Recommendations and Interventions for Diabetes]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref><ref>American Diabetes Association. January 2008. Nutrition Recommendations and Interventions for Diabetes. Diabetes Care, Volume 31: S61-S78. It states
:''For weight loss, either low-carbohydrate or low-fat calorie-restricted diets may be effective in the short term (up to 1-year).''</ref><ref>Christine Many Luff, ''[http://www.dlife.com/dLife/do/ShowContent/food_and_nutrition/ada_backs_low_carbs.html American Diabetes Association Backs Low-Carb Diets]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}, [http://www.dlife.com/ dLife], retrieved 18 July 2008. It states
:''The evidence is clear that both low-carbohydrate and low-fat calorie restricted diets result in similar weight loss at one year.''</ref>
The recommendations fall short of endorsing low-carbohydrate diets as a long-term health plan nor do they give any preference to these diets. Nevertheless, this is perhaps the first statement of support—albeit for the short-term—by one of the foremost medical organizations.<ref>''[http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/healthday/071228/diabetes-group-backs-low-carb-diets.htm Diabetes Group Backs Low-Carb Diets]'', [http://www.usnews.com/ U.S. News & World Report] 28 December 2007</ref><ref>Patrick Totty, ''[http://www.diabeteshealth.com/read/2008/01/09/5616.html ADA Now Supports Low-Carb Diets]'', [http://www.diabeteshealth.com/ Diabetes Health], 9 January 2008</ref> In its 2009 publication of ''Clinical Practice Recommendations'', the ADA again reaffirmed its acceptance of carbohydrate-controlled diets as an effective treatment for short-term (up to one year) weight loss among obese people suffering from type two diabetes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diabeteshealth.com/read/2008/12/29/6033/ada-2009-recommendations-reaffirm-acceptance-of-low-carb-diet/ |title=ADA 2009 Recommendations Reaffirm Acceptance of Low Carb Diet |date=29 December 2008 |accessdate=19 December 2010 }}</ref>
;American Dietetic Association
As of 2003 in commenting on a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, a spokesperson for the [[American Dietetic Association]] reiterated the association's belief that "there is no magic bullet to safe and healthful weight loss."<ref>[http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/media_3019_ENU_HTML.htm American Dietetic Association Says New Studies of Low-Carb Diets “Confirm What We Already Know – There Is No Magic Bullet to Safe and Healthful Weight Loss']{{dead link|date=March 2013}}, American Dietetic Organization, 21 May 2003.</ref> The Association specifically endorses the high-carbohydrate diet recommended by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. They have stated "Calories cause weight gain. Excess calories from carbohydrates are not any more fattening than calories from other sources. Despite the claims of low-carb diets, a high-carbohydrate diet does not promote fat storage by enhancing insulin resistance."<ref>[http://www.eatright.org/Public/content.aspx?id=10645 Question of the Day - Do Carbohydrates Cause Weight Gain?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
;American Heart Association
The official statement from the [[American Heart Association|AHA]] regarding these diets states categorically that the association "doesn't recommend high-protein diets."<ref>''[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=11234 High-Protein Diets]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}'', [http://www.americanheart.org/ American Heart Association]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}, 18 July 2008. It states
:The American Heart Association doesn't recommend high-protein diets for weight loss. Some of these diets restrict healthful foods that provide essential nutrients and don't provide the variety of foods needed to adequately meet nutritional needs. People who stay on these diets very long may not get enough vitamins and minerals and face other potential health risks.</ref>
A science advisory from the association further states the association's belief that these diets are "associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease."<ref name="AHA Science Advisory"/> The AHA has been one of the most adamant opponents of low-carbohydrate diets.  Dr. Robert Eckel, past president, noted that the association supported low-fat and low-saturated-fat diets, but that a low-carbohydrate diet could potentially meet AHA guidelines.<ref>Stobbe, Mike.  [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2008055196_apmedduelingdiets.html "Study: Low-carb diet best for weight, cholesterol."]  ''[[The Seattle Times]]''.  17 July 2008</ref>

;Australian Heart Foundation
The position statement by the Heart Foundation regarding low-carbohydrate diets states that "the Heart Foundation does not support the adoption of VLCARB diets for weight loss."<ref>''[http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/document/NHF/Very_low_carb_dietsPP_04.pdf Position Statement on Very Low Carbohydrate Diets]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}'', [http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/ Heart Foundation], retrieved 19 July 2008. It states
:Based on current available evidence, the Heart Foundation does not support the adoption of VLCARB diets for weight loss.
:...
:The Heart Foundation found that subjects in research studies achieved more weight and fat loss on the VLCARB diets than on the conventional low fat diets, but this was only in the short term.
:The Heart Foundation’s major concern with many VLCARB [Very Low Carb] diets is not their restriction of carbohydrate or increase in protein, but their high and unrestricted saturated fat content, which may contribute to cardiovascular risk.
</ref>
Although the statement recommends against use of low-carbohydrate diets it explains that their major concern is saturated fats as opposed to carbohydrate restriction and protein. Moreover, other statements suggest that their position might be re-evaluated in the event of more evidence from longer-term studies.
;Food Standards Agency (UK)
The consumer advice statements of the [[Food Standards Agency|FSA]] regarding low-carbohydrate diets state that "rather than avoiding starchy foods, it's better to try and base your meals on them."<ref>''[http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/healthydiet/nutritionessentials/starchfoods Starchy foods]'', [http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/ Food Standards Agency], retrieved 2 August 2008. It states
:Cutting out starchy foods, or any food group, can be bad for your health because you could be missing out on a range of nutrients. Low-carbohydrate diets tend to be high in fat, and eating a diet that is high in fat (especially saturated fat from foods such as meat, cheese, butter and cakes) could increase your chances of developing coronary heart disease.
:...
:So, rather than avoiding starchy foods, it's better to try and base your meals on them, so they make up about a third of your diet.</ref> They further state concerns regarding fat consumption in low-carbohydrate diets.
;Heart & Stroke Foundation (Canada)
The official position statement of the [[Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada|Heart & Stroke Foundation]] states "Do not follow a low carbohydrate diet for purposes of weight loss."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww2.heartandstroke.ca/Page.asp?PageID=33&ArticleID=5632&Src=living&From=SubCategory |title=? <!--Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada Position Statement: LOW CARBOHYDRATE DIETS AND HEART DISEASE AND STROKE --> |publisher=heartandstroke.ca |accessdate=retrieved 18 July 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2010}} It states

;National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)
In 2008, the ''[[Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare|Socialstyrelsen]]'' in Sweden altered its standing regarding low-carbohydrate diets.<ref>''[http://www.thelivinlowcarbshow.com/interview-dr-annika-dahlqvist-gets-swedish-government-to-promote-la-vida-low-carb-episode-107/ Exclusive Interview: Dr. Annika Dahlqvist Gets Swedish Government To Promote Livin’ La Vida Low-Carb!

;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]] issues consumer guidelines for maintaining heart health which state regarding low-carbohydrate diets that "they're not the route to healthy, long-term weight management."<ref>''[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/other/your_guide/healthyheart.pdf Your Guide to a Healthy Heart]'', U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, December 2005. It states
:... they’re not the route to healthy, long-term weight management. A diet high in fat, especially if it is high in saturated fat, is not good for your heart. These diets are also high in protein and can cause kidney problems and increased bone loss. High-fat, low-carb diets are also low in many essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber.</ref>

==Criticism and controversies==
===Water-related weight loss===
In the first week or two of a low-carbohydrate diet a great deal of the weight loss comes from eliminating water retained in the body (many doctors say that the presence of high levels of insulin in the blood causes unnecessary water retention in the body).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}<ref name="The Protein Power Lifeplan">Eades, M. (1995) ''The Protein Power Lifeplan'', Warner Books. ISBN 0-446-67867-8{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> However, this is a short-term effect and is entirely separate from the general weight loss that these diets can produce through eliminating excess body fat. A ketogenic diet is known to cause dehydration as an early-onset complication.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0013-9580.2004.10004.x |title=Early- and Late-onset Complications of the Ketogenic Diet for Intractable Epilepsy |year=2004 |last1=Kang |first1=Hoon Chul |last2=Chung |first2=Da Eun |last3=Kim |first3=Dong Wook |last4=Kim |first4=Heung Dong |journal=Epilepsia |volume=45 |issue=9 |pages=1116–23 |pmid=15329077}}</ref>

===Exercise===
John McDougall, a physician, diet book author, and advisory board member of the [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]], contends that low-carbohydrate diets can inherently cause weakness or fatigue<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aphroditewomenshealth.com/news/20040209193533_health_news.shtml |title=Warning On Low Carb Diets |publisher=Aphroditewomenshealth.com |date=10 March 2004 |accessdate=2011-12-18}}</ref> giving rise to the occasional assumption that low-carbohydrate dieting cannot involve an exercise regimen. Advocates of low-carbohydrate diets generally dispute any suggestion that such diets cause weakness or exhaustion (except in the first few weeks as the body adjusts) and indeed most highly recommend exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle.<ref name="The Protein Power Lifeplan"/><ref name=pmid15507148>{{Cite journal|author=Phinney SD |title=Ketogenic diets and physical performance |journal=Nutrition & Metabolism |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=2 |year=2004 |month= |pmid=15507148 |pmc=524027 |doi=10.1186/1743-7075-1-2}}</ref> There is a large body of evidence stretching back to the 1880s that shows that physical performance is not negatively affected by ketogenic diets once a person has been acclimatized to such a diet.<ref name="Phinney 2004 2">{{cite journal|last=Phinney|first=Stephen|title=Ketogenic diets and physical performance|journal=Nutrition and Metabolism|year=2004|doi=10.1186/1743-7075-1-2|url=http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/1/1/2|pmid=15507148|pmc=524027|volume=1|issue=1|page=2}}</ref>  Arctic cultures, such as the Inuit, were found to lead physically demanding lives and yet consume a diet almost completely devoid of carbohydrates.<ref name="Phinney 2004 2"/>  However, studies also indicate that while a low carbohydrate diet will not reduce endurance performance after adapting, they will probably deteriorate anaerobic performance such as strength training or sprint running because these processes rely on glycogen for fuel.<ref name=pmid15507148/>
A living example that a ketogenic diet can indeed be combined with outstanding achievements in physical exercise is the Olympic biathlon gold medalist [[Björn Ferry]], who won his gold medal after about 6 months on a low-carbohydrate high-fat diet.<ref>Dagens Nyheter: ''[http://www.dn.se/mat-dryck/reportage/ferrys-guldrecept Ferry's gold recipe]'', (in Swedish)</ref>

===Vegetables and fruits===
Many critics {{Who|{{subst:May 2011|date=May 2011}}|date=May 2011}} argue that low-carbohydrate diets inherently require minimizing vegetable and fruit consumption which in turn robs the body of important nutrients.<ref>Dolson, Laura: ''[http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/lowcarb101/a/myths1.htm The Most Common Low Carb Misconception]'', [http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/ About.com: Low Carb Diets], 18 November 2006</ref> Some critics imply or explicitly argue that vegetables and fruits are inherently all heavily concentrated sources of carbohydrates (so much so that some sources literally treat the words ''vegetable'' and ''carbohydrate'' as synonymous).<ref>''[http://www.womenshealthchannel.com/nutrition-guide/carbohydrates.shtml Nutrition: Carbohydrates]'', Women's Health Channel, retrieved 13 March 2008</ref> While some fruits may contain relatively high concentrations of sugar, most are largely water and not particularly calorie-dense. Thus, in absolute terms, even sweet fruits and berries do not represent a significant source of carbohydrates in their natural form and also typically contain a good deal of fiber which attenuates the absorption of sugar in the gut<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Weickert MO, Pfeiffer AF |title=Metabolic effects of dietary fiber consumption and prevention of diabetes |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=138 |issue=3 |pages=439–42 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18287346 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18287346}}</ref> and lastly, most of the sugar in fruit is fructose which, in obese subjects, has a reported negligible effect on insulin levels.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.2008-2192 |title=Endocrine and Metabolic Effects of Consuming Fructose- and Glucose-Sweetened Beverages with Meals in Obese Men and Women: Influence of Insulin Resistance on Plasma Triglyceride Responses |year=2009 |last1=Teff |first1=K.

Cites 2004 study in ''The Archives of Internal Medicine'' showing that fiber from cereals and fruits is more beneficial than fiber from vegetable sources.</ref>

Contrary to the recommendations of most low-carbohydrate diet guides, some individuals may choose to avoid vegetables altogether in order to minimize carbohydrate intake. Low-carbohydrate [[vegetarianism]] is also practiced. <!--Carrot sticks and veggie sticks are especially useful in low carb diet recipes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lowcarbdietsrecipes.org/ |title=Ideas For Low Carb Diet Food Planning  |date=25 September 2010 |author= Peter |accessdate=19 December 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Dolson |first=Laura |url=http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/vegetarian/a/veganlowcarb.htm |title=Meet a Vegan Low Carber!

Raw fruits and vegetables are packed with an array of other protective chemicals like vitamins, flavonoids and sugar alcohols.

===Micronutrients and vitamins===
The major low-carbohydrate diet guides generally recommend multi-vitamin and mineral supplements as part of the diet regimen which may lead some to believe that these diets are nutritionally deficient. The primary reason for this recommendation is that if the switch from a high-carbohydrate to a low-carbohydrate, [[ketogenic]] diet is rapid, the body can temporarily go through a period of adjustment during which the body may require extra vitamins and minerals (the reasons have to do with the body's releasing excess fluids that were stored during high-carbohydrate eating).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In other words, the body goes through a temporary "shock" if the diet is changed to low-carbohydrate dieting quickly just as it would changing to a high-carbohydrate diet quickly. This does not, in and of itself, indicate that either type of diet is nutritionally deficient.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} While it is true that many foods that are rich in carbohydrates are also rich in vitamins and minerals, there are many low-carbohydrate foods that are similarly rich in vitamins and minerals.<ref>Cordain, Loren: ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=uloKAAAACAAJ&dq=the+paleo+diet The Paleo Diet]'', pages 106–107, Wiley, 2002, 272 pages, ISBN 0-471-41390-9</ref>

===Glucose availability===
A common argument in favor of high-carbohydrate diets is that most carbohydrates break down readily into glucose in the bloodstream and, therefore, the body does not have to work as hard to get its energy in a high-carbohydrate diet as a low-carbohydrate diet. This argument, by itself, is incomplete. Although many dietary carbohydrates do break down into glucose, most of that glucose does not remain in the bloodstream for long. Its presence stimulates the beta cells in the pancreas to release insulin which has the effect of causing about 2/3 of body cells to take in glucose, and to cause fat cells to take in fatty acids and store them. As the blood glucose level falls, the amount of insulin released is reduced; the entire process is completed in non-diabetics in an hour or two after eating.<ref>Craig Freudenrich, PhD: ''[http://health.howstuffworks.com/fat-cell2.htm How Fat Cells Work]'', [http://health.howstuffworks.com/ How Stuff Works], retrieved 25 July 2008</ref>  High-carbohydrate diets require more insulin production and release than low-carbohydrate diets{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and there is some evidence that the increasingly large percentage of calories consumed as refined carbohydrates is positively correlated with the increased incidence of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gross LS, Li L, Ford ES, Liu S |title=Increased consumption of refined carbohydrates and the epidemic of type 2 diabetes in the United States: an ecologic assessment |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=774–9 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15113714 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15113714}}</ref>

In addition, this claim neglects the nature of the carbohydrates ingested. Some are indigestible in humans (e.g., cellulose), some are poorly digested in humans (e.g., the amylose starch variant), and some require considerable processing to be converted to absorbable forms. In general, uncooked or unprocessed (e.g., milling, crushing, etc.) foods are harder (typically much harder) to absorb and so do not raise glucose levels as much as might be expected from the proportion of carbohydrate present. Cooking (especially moist cooking above the temperature necessary to expand starch granules), and mechanical processing, both considerably raise the amount of absorbable carbohydrate and reduce the digestive effort required. Analyses which neglect these factors are misleading and will not result in a working diet, or at least one which works as intended. (See Catching Fire, Richard Wrangham)

In fact, there is some evidence that the human brain – the largest consumer of glucose in the body – can operate more efficiently on ketones.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Veech RL, Chance B, Kashiwaya Y, Lardy HA, Cahill GF |title=Ketone bodies, potential therapeutic uses |journal=IUBMB Life |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=241–7 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11569918 |doi=10.1080/152165401753311780}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2012}}

In 2004, the Canadian government ruled that foods sold in Canada could not be marketed with reduced or eliminated carbohydrate content as a selling point because reduced carbohydrate content was not determined to be a health benefit, and that existing "low carb" and "no carb" packaging would have to be phased out by 2006.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Some variants of low carbohydrate diets involve substantially lowered intake of [[dietary fiber]] which can result in [[constipation]] if not supplemented.{{Citation needed|reason=What is the scientific evidence for this assertion?|date=January 2011}} For example, this has been a criticism of the Induction phase of the Atkins diet (the Atkins diet is now clearer about recommending a fiber supplement during Induction). Most advocates today argue that fiber is a "good" carbohydrate and encourage a high-fiber diet.

It has been hypothesized that a diet-related change in blood acidity can lead to bone loss through a process called [[ketoacidosis]], as mentioned earlier in this article. However ketoacidosis, which is often confused with ketosis, is an acute medical condition caused by extreme fasting or as a symptom of untreated diabetes, and is not likely to be induced by an otherwise adequate low-carbohydrate diet.

One of the occasional side effects of a ketogenic diet is a noticeable smell of [[ketone]]s in the urine, perspiration, and breath.<ref>{{cite web |title=Low-Carb Diets Can Cause Bad Breath |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=52504 |first=Denise |last=Mann |date=Medically Updated 7 April 2005 |accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref> This is caused by the presence of larger than usual amounts of the three ketone bodies normally produced during fat metabolism. One of the ketone bodies, [[acetone]], is released via the lungs and has a characteristic smell of overripe fruit or nail polish remover. In most cases, periodic ketosis (as occurs between widely separated meals) does not cause a noticeable odor.
