'''Placenta accreta''' is a severe [[obstetrics|obstetric]] complication involving an abnormally deep attachment of the [[placenta]] to the [[myometrium]] (the middle, muscular layer of the [[uterus|uterine wall]]), without penetrating it. Thus, the placenta grows completely through the [[endometrium]].<ref>[Mount Sinai Hospital] '[http://www.mountsinai.on.ca/care/placenta-clinic/complications/invasiveplacenta Invasive Placenta]'. Accessed 22 March 2013</ref>

The placenta usually detaches from the uterine wall relatively easily, but women who encounter placenta accreta during [[childbirth]] are at great risk of [[obstetrical hemorrhage|haemorrhage]] during its removal. This commonly requires [[surgery]] to stem the bleeding and fully remove the placenta, and in severe forms can often lead to a [[hysterectomy]] or be fatal.

==Etiology==
It occurs due to abnormalities in [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].<ref name=labourprac>{{cite book|last=Arulkumaran|first=edited by Richard Warren, Sabaratnam|title=Best practice in labour and delivery|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-72068-7|pages=108, 146|edition=1st ed., 3rd printing.}}</ref> 
===Risk factors===
The condition is increased in incidence by the presence of [[scar|scar tissue]] i.e. [[Asherman's syndrome]] usually from past uterine surgery, especially from a past [[Dilation and curettage]],<ref name="Capella">{{cite journal |pages=1230–3 |doi=10.1093/humrep/14.5.1230 |title=Hysteroscopic treatment of severe Asherman's syndrome and subsequent fertility |year=1999 |last1=Capella-Allouc |first1=S. |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=14 |issue=5 |pmid=10325268 |last2=Morsad |first2=F |last3=Rongières-Bertrand |first3=C |last4=Taylor |first4=S |last5=Fernandez |first5=H}}</ref> (which is used for many indications including miscarriage, termination, and postpartum hemorrhaging), myomectomy,<ref name="Al Serehi">{{cite journal |pmid=18946102 |year=2008 |last1=Al-Serehi |first1=A |last2=Mhoyan |first2=A |last3=Brown |first3=M |last4=Benirschke |first4=K |last5=Hull |first5=A |last6=Pretorius |first6=DH |title=Placenta accreta: An association with fibroids and Asherman syndrome |volume=27 |issue=11 |pages=1623–8 |journal=Journal of ultrasound in medicine}}</ref> or [[caesarean section]]. A thin [[decidua]] can also be a contributing factor to such [[trophoblast]]ic invasion. Some studies suggest that the rate of incidence is higher when the [[fetus]] is female.<ref>[http://www.americanpregnancy.org American Pregnancy Association] (January 2004) '[http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancycomplications/placentaaccreta.html Placenta Accreta]'. Accessed 16 October 2006</ref>  Other risk factors include low lying placenta, anterior placenta, congenital or acquired uterine defects (such as uterine septa), [[leiomyoma]],ectopic implantation of placenta (including [[cornual pregnancy]]).<ref name=labourprac /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bass|first=KE|coauthors=Morrish, D; Roth, I; Bhardwaj, D; Taylor, R; Zhou, Y; Fisher, SJ|title=Human cytotrophoblast invasion is up-regulated by epidermal growth factor: evidence that paracrine factors modify this process.|journal=Developmental biology|date=1994 Aug|volume=164|issue=2|pages=550–61|pmid=8045351|accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Shimonovitz|first=S|coauthors=Hurwitz, A; Dushnik, M; Anteby, E; Geva-Eldar, T; Yagel, S|title=Developmental regulation of the expression of 72 and 92 kd type IV collagenases in human trophoblasts: a possible mechanism for control of trophoblast invasion.|journal=American journal of obstetrics and gynecology|date=1994 Sep|volume=171|issue=3|pages=832–8|pmid=7522400|accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=acog>{{cite journal|last=ACOG Committee on Obstetric|first=Practice|title=ACOG Committee opinion.

==Pathogenesis==
The placenta forms an abnormally firm attachment to the uterine wall. There is absence of the [[decidua basalis]] and incomplete development of the [[Nitabuch's layer]].<ref name=gabbe>{{cite book|first=[ed. by] Steven G. Gabbe; Jennifer R. Niebyl; Joe Leigh Simpson|title=Obstetrics : normal and problem pregnancies|year=2002|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=9780443065729|pages=519|edition=4. ed.}}</ref> 
There are three forms of placenta accreta, distinguishable by the depth of penetration.

!  Percent
|-
|  Placenta accreta
|  The plancenta attaches strongly to the myometrium, but does not penetrate it. This form of the condition accounts for around 75% of all cases.

|  Placenta increta
|  Occurs when the placenta penetrates the myometrium.

|  Placenta percreta
|  The worst form of the condition is when the placenta penetrates the entire myometrium to the uterine [[serosa]] (invades through entire uterine wall).  This variant can lead to the placenta attaching to other organs such as the rectum or [[urinary bladder|bladder]].<ref>Miller, David A. (2 November 2004).

==Signs and symptoms==
There can be recurrent vaginal spotting and [[wikt:overt|overt]] hemorrhages. These symptoms and signs are not specific to the condition itself and are commonly seen in different obstetric conditions.

Myometrial invasion by placental villi at site of scar of previous caesarian section can lead to uterine rupture before labor, as early as 12 weeks.<ref>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=[edited by] F. Gary Cunningham ... [et|title=Williams obstetrics.|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York ; Toronto|isbn=9780071413152|edition=22nd ed.}}</ref> 

==Diagnosis==
Placenta accreta is very rarely recognised before birth, and is very difficult to diagnose. A Doppler [[ultrasound]] can lead to the diagnosis of a suspected accreta and an [[MRI]] will give more detail leading to further suspicion of such an abnormal placenta. However, both the ultrasound and the MRI rarely confirm an accreta with certainty. While it can lead to some vaginal bleeding during the third trimester, this is more commonly associated with the factors leading to the condition. In some cases the second trimester can see elevated maternal serum [[alpha-fetoprotein]] levels, though this is also an indicator of many other conditions.<ref>Mayes, M., Sweet, B. R. & Tiran, D. (1997). Mayes' Midwifery - A Textbook for Midwives 12th Edition, pp. 524, 709. Bailli&egrave;re Tindall. ISBN 0-7020-1757-4</ref> A three dimensional power color doppler ultrasound scan has been used with good detection rates ([[Positive predictive value|PPV]] 87.5%).<ref name=labourprac/>

During birth, placenta accreta is suspected if the placenta has not been delivered within 30 minutes of the birth.  Usually in this case, manual blunt dissection or placenta traction is attempted but can cause hemorrhage in accreta.

==Complications==
Sometimes, placenta accreta invades bladder.<ref name =gabbe />

==Treatment==
The safest and most common treatment is a planned caesarean section and abdominal [[hysterectomy]] if placenta accreta is diagnosed before birth.<ref>{{cite book |first1=T A |last1=Johnston |first2=S |last2=Paterson-Brown |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists |month=January |year=2011 |title=Placenta Praevia, Placenta Praevia Accreta and Vasa Praevia: Diagnosis and Management |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/clinical-guidance/placenta-praevia-and-placenta-praevia-accreta-diagnosis-and-manageme |series=Green-top Guideline No. 27}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |pages=927–41 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000207559.15715.98 |title=Placenta Previa, Placenta Accreta, and Vasa Previa |year=2006 |last1=Oyelese |first1=Yinka |last2=Smulian |first2=John C. |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume=107 |issue=4 |pmid=16582134}}</ref> [[Pitocin]] and antibiotics are used for post-surgical management.<ref name=protocols>{{cite book|last=Turrentine|first=John E.|title=Clinical protocols in obstetrics and gynecology|year=2008|publisher=Informa Healthcare|location=London|isbn=9780415439961|pages=286|edition=3rd ed.}}</ref> When there is partially separated placenta with focal accreta, best option is removal of placenta and oversewing the uterine defect. If it is important to save the woman's uterus (for future pregnancies) then resection around the placenta may be successful. Conservative treatment can also be uterus sparing but may not be as successful and has a higher risk of complications.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  
Techniques include:
* Leaving the placenta in the uterus and [[curettage]] of uterus. [[Methotrexate]] has been used in this case,<ref name=protocols /> but there is no consensus whether this therapy is any more effective than observation.<ref name =gabbe />
* Intrauterine balloon catheterisation to compress blood vessels
* [[Embolisation]] of pelvic vessels
* [[Internal iliac artery]] ligation
* Bilateral [[uterine artery]] ligation

In cases where there is invasion of bladder, it is treated in similar manner to abdominal pregnancy and manual placental removal is avoided. However, this may eventually need hysterectomy and/or partial [[cystectomy]].<ref name=gabbe />

If [[gravidity|gravida]] decides to proceed with a vaginal delivery, blood products for transfusion and an anesthesiologist are kept ready at delivery.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=77–8 |doi=10.1016/S0020-7292(02)80003-0 |title=Placenta accreta Number 266, January 2002 Committee on Obstetric Practice |year=2002 |journal=International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics |volume=77 |pmid=12053897 |last1=Committee On Obstetric |first1=Practice |issue=1}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Placenta accreta affects approximately 1 in 533 [[pregnancy|pregnancies]].<ref>Wu S, Kocherginsky M, Hibbard JU. Abnormal placentation: twenty-year analysis. Am J Obstet Gynecol 2005 May;192(5):1458-61.</ref> The risk of placenta accreta in future deliveries after caesarian section is 0.4-0.8%. It occurs in 15% of patients with [[placenta praevia]].<ref name=labourprac /> Patients above 35 years of age, who have had placenta praevia and also a caesarian section have 40% chance of placenta accreta.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hobbins|first=John C.|title=Obstetric ultrasound : artistry in practice|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4051-5815-2|pages=10}}</ref> In patients with placenta praevia and multiple caesarian sections, the risk is 60-65%.<ref name=gabbe />In 2002, [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]] estimated that incidence has increased 10-fold over past 50 years.<ref name=acog />
