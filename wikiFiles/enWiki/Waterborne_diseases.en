'''Waterborne diseases''' are caused by [[pathogenic]] [[microorganisms]] that most commonly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water. Infection commonly results during bathing, washing, drinking, in the preparation of food, or the consumption of food thus infected. Various forms of waterborne diarrheal disease probably are the most prominent examples, and affect mainly children in developing countries; according to the [[World Health Organization]], such disease account for an estimated 4.1% of the total [[DALY]] [[global burden of disease]], and cause about 1.8 million human deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that 88% of that burden is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/burden/en/index.html WHO|title= Burden of disease and cost-effectiveness estimates}}</ref>

==Overview==
The term "waterborne disease" is reserved largely for infections that predominantly are transmitted through contact with or consumption of infected water. Trivially, many infections might be transmitted by microbes or parasites that accidentally, possibly as a result of exceptional circumstances, had got into water, but the fact that there might be an occasional freak infection need not mean that it is useful to categorise the resulting disease as "waterborne". Nor is it common practice to refer diseases such as [[malaria]] as "waterborne" just because [[mosquito]]es have aquatic phases in their life cycles, or because treating the water they inhabit happens to be an effective strategy in control of the mosquitoes that are the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s.   

[[Microorganism]]s causing diseases that characteristically are waterborne, prominently include [[protozoa]] and [[bacteria]], many of which are [[intestinal parasites]], or invade the tissues or circulatory system through walls of the digestive tract. Various other waterborne diseases are caused by [[virus]]es. (In spite of philosophical difficulties associated with defining viruses as "[[organism]]s", it is practical and convenient to regard them as microorganisms in this connection.) 

Yet other important classes of water-borne diseases are caused by [[Animal|metazoa]]n parasites. Typical examples include certain [[Nematoda]], that is to say "roundworms". As an example of water-borne Nematode infections, one important waterborne nematodal disease is [[Dracunculiasis]]. It is acquired by swallowing water in which certain [[copepod]]a occur that act as vectors for the Nematoda. Anyone swallowing a copepod that happens to be infected with Nematode [[larva]]e in the [[genus]] [[Dracunculus (animal)|Dracunculus]], becomes liable to infection. The larvae cause [[Dracunculiasis|guinea worm disease]].<ref name="isbn0-697-26071-2">{{cite book |author=Janovy, John; Schmidt, Gerald D.; Roberts, Larry S. |title=Gerald D. Schmidt & Larry S.

Another class of waterborne [[Animal|metazoa]]n pathogens are certain members of the [[Schistosomatidae]], a family of blood [[Trematoda|flukes]]. They usually infect victims that make skin contact with the water.<ref name="isbn0-697-26071-2"/> Blood flukes are pathogens that cause [[Schistosomiasis]] of various forms, more or less seriously affecting hundreds of millions of people world-wide.<ref>Brunette, Gary W.

Long before modern studies had established the [[germ theory of disease]], or any advanced understanding of the nature of water as a vehicle for transmitting disease, traditional beliefs had cautioned against the consumption of water, rather favouring processed beverages such as [[beer]], [[wine]] and [[tea]]. For example, in the [[Camel train|camel caravan]]s that crossed [[Central Asia]] along the [[Silk Road]], the explorer [[Owen Lattimore]] noted, "The reason we drank so much tea was because of the bad water. Water alone, unboiled, is never drunk. There is a superstition that it causes blisters on the feet."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lattimore |title=The caravan routes of inner Asia|journal=The Geographical Journal|volume=72|issue=6 |year=1928|page=500}} quoted in {{cite book|first=Frances |last=Wood|title=The Silk Road: two thousand years in the heart of Asia| year= 2002|page=19}}</ref>

==Socioeconomic impact==

Waterborne diseases can have a significant impact on the economy, locally as well as internationally. People who are infected by a waterborne disease are usually confronted with related costs and not seldom with a huge financial burden. This is especially the case in less developed countries. The financial losses are mostly caused by e.g. costs for medical treatment and medication, costs for transport, special food, and by the loss of manpower. Many families must even sell their land to pay for treatment in a proper hospital. On average, a family spends about 10% of the monthly households income per person infected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/092423/index.en.shtml|title=Drastic consequences of diarrhoeal disease|first=Bastian |last=Schnabel }}</ref>
