'''Organ transplantation in Japan''' is regulated by the 1997 Organ Transplant Law which legalized organ procurement from "[[Brain death|brain dead]]" donors.<ref name=jotnw>{{cite web |url=http://www.jotnw.or.jp/english/00.html |title=Japan Organ Transplant Network ­ Organ Transplanting in Japan |publisher=www.jotnw.or.jp |accessdate=2010-07-05 }}</ref> After an early involvement in organ transplantation that was on a par with developments in the rest of the world, attitudes in Japan altered after a [[Organ transplant|transplant]] by Dr. Wada in 1968 failed, and a subsequent ban on cadaveric [[organ donation]] lasted thirty years. The first transplant after the Organ Transplant Law had defined "brain death" took place in February 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/287880.stm |title=BBC News | Health | Transplant first in Japan |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-05 | date=1999-02-28}}</ref>

Due to cultural reasons and a relative distrust of [[western medicine]], the rate of organ donation in [[Japan]] is significantly lower than in Western countries.<ref name="Wicks">{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/408769 |title=Brain Death and Transplantation: The Japanese |publisher=Medscape |date=2000-04-25|accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref>

==History==
The first organ transplant in Japan took place at [[Niigata University]] in 1956 when a kidney was temporarily transplanted to a patient with acute renal failure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/1w12311638357105/ |title=SpringerLink - Journal Article |publisher=www.springerlink.com |accessdate=2010-07-05 }}</ref> In 1964 a permanent and full-scale [[kidney transplant]] was successfully undertaken at the [[University of Tokyo]], and by 1992 nearly 9,000 kidney transplants had taken place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=73sE6NkXPbAC&pg=PA185&dq=kidney+transplant+1964+tokyo&hl=en&ei=OiAyTNuUG8jKjAeWk5XDBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=kidney%20transplant%201964%20tokyo&f=false |title=Case studies on human rights in Japan - Google Books |publisher=books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-05 }}</ref> In the same year, a [[liver transplant]] was performed at [[Chiba University]] by Professor Komei Nakayama.<ref name=heoncologist>{{cite web |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/content/full/12/11/1321 |title=Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Asia -- de Villa and Lo 12 (11): 1321 -- The Oncologist |publisher=theoncologist.alphamedpress.org |accessdate=2010-07-05 }}</ref> The first heart transplant in Japan was conducted at [[Sapporo Medical University]] in 1968 by Dr Wada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bioethics.jp/licht_transplant98.html |title=Organ Transplantation and Brain-Death in Japan. |publisher=www.bioethics.jp |accessdate=2010-07-05 }}</ref> This operation attracted concerns that Dr. Wada's evaluation of brain death was inappropriate, and even though an investigation of possible criminal liability was dismissed, a distrust of organ transplanting developed, particularly of transplants from brain dead donors.

==Cultural attitudes==
The Japanese people's views regarding life, death, ethics and religion have influenced their negative attitude toward organ transplanting. The Wada heart transplant in 1968 increased a sense of apprehension, especially regarding the evaluation of brain death.<ref name=jotnw/> The Shinto religion regards death as impure, and has tainted connotations which have carried through into Japanese culture. [[Burakumin]] are a Japanese minority whose occupations dealt with death.
