'''Bloodletting''' (or '''blood-letting''') is the withdrawal of often small quantities of [[blood]] from a patient to cure or prevent illness and [[disease]]. Bloodletting was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluid were regarded as "humors" that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health. It was the most common [[medicine|medical]] practice performed by physicians from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of almost 2,000 years.<ref name="blood">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/bloodletting.aspx|title=Bloodletting|accessdate=2009-07-12|publisher=''British Science Museum'' |year=2009}}</ref> The practice has now been abandoned for all except a few very specific [[medical condition|conditions]].<ref name="leech">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/06/health/he-31093|title=Modern Bloodletting and Leeches|accessdate=2009-07-12|publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |date=6 August 2001 | first=Rosie | last=Mestel}}</ref> It is conceivable that historically, in the absence of other treatments for [[hypertension]], bloodletting could sometimes have had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing [[blood pressure]] by reducing blood volume.<ref name="centuries">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/redgold/basics/bloodlettinghistory.html|title=Bloodletting Over the Centuries|accessdate=2009-07-12|publisher=''Gilbert R.

==In the ancient world==

Bloodletting is one of the oldest medical techniques, having been practiced among ancient peoples including the [[Mesopotamia]]ns, the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], the [[Mayans]], and the [[Aztecs]].<ref name="centuries"/> In Greece, bloodletting was in use in the fifth century B.C. during the lifetime of [[Hippocrates]], who mentions this practice but generally relied on [[Dieting|dietary techniques]].<ref name="Hippo">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/brunel/A885062|title=Degeneration of Medicine and the Grisly Art of Slicing Open Arms|accessdate=2009-07-12|publisher=''BBC'' |date=29 November 2002}}</ref> [[Erasistratus]], however, theorized that many diseases were caused by plethoras, or overabundances, in the blood and advised that these plethoras be treated, initially, by [[exercise]], [[Perspiration|sweating]], reduced food intake, and [[vomiting]].<ref name="eras">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-aFtPdh6-2QC&pg=PA269&lpg=PA269&dq=Erasistratus%2Bbloodletting|title=Encyclopedia of ancient Greece|accessdate=2009-07-12|publisher=''Nigel Guy Wilson'' |year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-97334-2}}</ref> [[Herophilus]] advocated bloodletting. [[Archagathus]], one of the first Greek physicians to practice in [[Roman Republic|Rome]], also believed in the value of bloodletting.

"Bleeding" a patient to health was modeled on the process of menstruation. Hippocrates believed that menstruation functioned to "purge women of bad humors". During the [[Roman Empire]], the Greek physician [[Galen]], who subscribed to the teachings of Hippocrates, advocated physician-initiated bloodletting.<ref>Elsimar M. Coutinho, ''Is Menstruation Obsolete?'',Oxford University Press 1999</ref>

The popularity of bloodletting in the classical Mediterranean world was reinforced by the ideas of [[Galen]], after he discovered that not only [[vein]]s but also [[artery|arteries]] were filled with blood, not [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] as was commonly believed at the time. There were two key concepts in his system of bloodletting. The first was that blood was created and then used up; it did not [[Circulation (physiology)|circulate]], and so it could "stagnate" in the extremities. The second was that humoral balance was the basis of illness or health, [[the four humours]] being blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile, relating to the four Greek [[classical element]]s of air, water, earth and fire respectively. Galen believed that blood was the dominant humour and the one in most need of control. In order to balance the humours, a [[physician]] would either remove "excess" blood (plethora) from the patient or give them an [[emetic]] to induce vomiting, or a [[diuretic]] to induce urination.

Galen created a complex system of how much blood should be removed based on the patient's age, constitution, the season, the weather and the place. Symptoms of plethora were believed to include [[fever]], [[apoplexy]], and [[headache]]. The blood to be let was of a specific nature determined by the disease: either arterial or [[venous blood|venous]], and distant or close to the area of the body affected. He linked different [[blood vessel]]s with different [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], according to their supposed drainage. For example, the vein in the right hand would be let for [[liver]] problems and the vein in the left hand for problems with the [[spleen]]. The more severe the disease, the more blood would be let. Fevers required copious amounts of bloodletting.

The [[Talmud]] recommended a specific day of the week and days of the month for bloodletting, and similar rules, though less codified, can be found among [[Christianity|Christian]] writings advising which [[saint's day|saints' days]] were favourable for bloodletting. [[Islamic medicine|Islamic medical authors]] too advised bloodletting, particularly for fevers. The practice was probably passed to them by the Greeks; when Islamic theories became known in the [[Latin]]-speaking countries of [[Europe]], bloodletting became more widespread. Together with [[cautery]], it was central to [[Arab]]ic surgery; the key texts ''[[The Canon of Medicine|Kitab al-Qanun]]'' and especially ''[[Al-Tasrif|Al-Tasrif li-man 'ajaza 'an al-ta'lif]]'' both recommended it. It was also known in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medicine, described in the ''Susruta Samhita''.

==In the 2nd millennium==

Even after the humoral system fell into disuse, the practice was continued by [[surgery|surgeons]] and [[Barber surgeon|barber-surgeons]]. Though the bloodletting was often ''recommended'' by [[physician]]s, it was carried out by barbers. This [[division of labour]] led to the distinction between physicians and surgeons. The [[Barber's pole|red-and-white-striped pole]] of the [[Barbershop (hair)|barbershop]], still in use today, is derived from this practice: the red represents the blood being drawn, the white represents the [[tourniquet]] used, and the pole itself represents the stick squeezed in the patient's hand to [[Vasodilation|dilate]] the veins. Bloodletting was used to "treat" a wide range of diseases, becoming a standard treatment for almost every ailment, and was practiced [[prophylaxis|prophylactically]] as well as therapeutically.

The benefits of bloodletting only began to be seriously questioned in the second half of the 1800s. While many physicians in [[England]] at the time had lost faith in the general value of bloodletting, some still considered it beneficial in some circumstances, for instance to "clear out" infected or weakened blood or its ability to "cause [[hæmorrhage]]s to cease"—as evidenced in a call for a "fair trial for blood-letting as a remedy" in 1871.<ref>

Bloodletting persisted into the 20th century and was even recommended by Sir [[William Osler]] in the 1923 edition of his textbook ''[[The Principles and Practice of Medicine]]''.<ref>[http://www.library.ucla.edu/specialcollections/biomedicallibrary/12193.cfm Bloodletting - UCLA Biomedical Library History and Special Collections for the Sciences]</ref>
<!--
This section needs to be referenced in order to stay in the article, there is a nice reference (reused in new text above) but it does not support the claims in the section:
The practice continued throughout the [[Middle Ages]] but began to be questioned in the 16th century, particularly in northern Europe and the [[Netherlands]]. In [[France]], the court and university physicians advocated frequent phlebotomy. In [[England]], the efficacy of bloodletting was hotly debated,<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=2260507&pageindex=1#page British Medical Journal: Blood-letting], page 283, March 18, 1871, retrieved on March 21, 2008</ref> declining throughout the 18th century, and briefly revived for treating [[tropical fever]]s in the 19th century.

A number of different methods were employed. The most common was ''phlebotomy'', or ''venesection'' (often called "breathing a vein"), in which blood was drawn from one or more of the larger external veins, such as those in the forearm or neck. In ''arteriotomy'', an artery was punctured, although generally only in the temples. In ''scarification'' (not to be confused with [[scarification]], a method of body modification), the "superficial" vessels were attacked, often using a syringe, a spring-loaded [[Scalpel|lancet]], or a glass cup that contained heated air, producing a [[vacuum]] within (see [[fire cupping]]). There was also a specific bloodletting tool called a ''scarificator'', used primarily in 19th century medicine. It has a spring-loaded mechanism with gears that snaps the blades out through slits in the front cover and back in, in a circular motion. The case is cast brass, and the mechanism and blades steel. One knife bar gear has slipped teeth, turning the blades in a different direction than those on the other bars. The last photo and the diagram show the depth adjustment bar at the back and sides.

[[File:BloodlettingPhoto.jpg|thumb|left|Bloodletting in 1860, one of only three known photographs of the procedure.]]
[[Leech]]es could also be used. The withdrawal of so much blood as to induce [[Vasovagal episode|syncope]] (fainting) was considered beneficial, and many sessions would only end when the patient began to swoon.

[[William Harvey]] disproved the basis of the practice in 1628, and the introduction of [[Evidence-based medicine|scientific medicine]], ''la méthode numérique'', allowed [[Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis]] to demonstrate that phlebotomy was entirely ineffective in the treatment of [[pneumonia]] and various fevers in the 1830s. Nevertheless, in 1840, a lecturer at the [[Royal College of Physicians]] would still state that "blood-letting is a remedy which, when judiciously employed, it is hardly possible to estimate too highly",<ref>{{cite book|last=Clutterbuck|first=Henry|title=Dr Clutterbuck's Lectures On Bloodletting: Lecture 1|year=1838|publisher=The London Medical Gazette|url=http://books.google.com/?id=rs9bDPounQwC&pg=PA9&dq=%22blood-letting+is+a+remedy+which,+when+judiciously+employed%22#v=onepage&q=%22blood-letting%20is%20a%20remedy%20which%2C%20when%20judiciously%20employed%22&f=false}}</ref> and Louis was dogged by the sanguinary [[François-Joseph-Victor Broussais|Broussais]], who could recommend leeches fifty at a time.

Bloodletting was used to treat almost every disease. One British medical text recommended bloodletting for acne, asthma, cancer, cholera, coma, convulsions, diabetes, epilepsy, gangrene, gout, herpes, indigestion, insanity, jaundice, leprosy, ophthalmia, plague, pneumonia, scurvy, smallpox, stroke, tetanus, tuberculosis, and for some one hundred other diseases. Bloodletting was even used to treat most forms of hemorrhaging such as nosebleed, excessive menstruation, or hemorrhoidal bleeding. Before surgery or at the onset of childbirth, blood was removed to prevent inflammation. Before amputation, it was customary to remove a quantity of blood equal to the amount believed to circulate in the limb that was to be removed.<ref>Carter (2005) p6</ref>

Leeches became especially popular in the early nineteenth century. In the 1830s, the French imported about forty million leeches a year for medical purposes, and in the next decade, England imported six million leeches a year from France alone. Through the early decades of the century, hundreds of millions of leeches were used by physicians throughout Europe.<ref>Carter (2005) p7</ref>

One typical course of medical treatment began the morning of 13 July 1824. A French sergeant was stabbed through the chest while engaged in single combat; within minutes, he fainted from loss of blood. Arriving at the local hospital he was immediately bled twenty ounces (570&nbsp;ml) "to prevent inflammation". During the night he was bled another 24&nbsp;ounces (680&nbsp;ml). Early the next morning, the chief surgeon bled the patient another 10&nbsp;ounces (285&nbsp;ml); during the next 14 hours, he was bled five more times. Medical attendants thus intentionally removed more than half of the patient's normal blood supply—in addition to the initial blood loss which caused the sergeant to faint. Bleedings continued over the next several days. By 29 July, the wound had become inflamed. The physician applied 32 leeches to the most sensitive part of the wound. Over the next three days, there were more bleedings and a total of 40 more leeches. The sergeant recovered and was discharged on 3 October. His physician wrote that "by the large quantity of blood lost, amounting to 170&nbsp;ounces [nearly eleven pints] (4.8&nbsp;liters), besides that drawn by the application of leeches [perhaps another two pints] (1.1&nbsp;liters), the life of the patient was preserved". By nineteenth-century standards, thirteen pints of blood taken over the space of a month was a large but not an exceptional quantity. The medical literature of the period contains many similar accounts-some successful, some not.<ref>During the Yellow Fever this practice was also used by Dr. Rush.

Bloodletting was also popular in the young [[United States of America]], where [[Benjamin Rush]] (a signatory of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]) saw the state of the arteries as the key to disease, recommending levels of bloodletting that were high even for the time. [[George Washington]] asked to be bled heavily after he developed a throat infection from weather exposure. Within a ten hour period, a total of 124-126 [[ounces]] (3.75 [[liters]]) of blood was withdrawn prior to his death from a throat infection in 1799.<ref>[http://www.thepermanentejournal.org/files/Spring2004/time.pdf The Permanente Journal Volume 8 No. 2: The asphyxiating and exsanguinating death of president george washington], page 79, Spring, 2004, retrieved on November 11, 2012</ref>
[[Image:Bloodstick2.jpg|thumb|Bloodsticks for use when bleeding animals]]
One reason for the continued popularity of bloodletting (and purging) was that, while [[anatomy|anatomical]] knowledge, surgical and diagnostic skills increased tremendously in Europe from the 17th century, the key to curing disease remained elusive, and the underlying belief was that it was better to give any treatment than nothing at all. The psychological benefit of bloodletting to the patient (a [[placebo effect]]) may sometimes have outweighed the physiological problems it caused. Bloodletting slowly lost favour during the 19th century, but a number of other ineffective or harmful treatments were available as placebos&mdash;[[mesmerism]], various processes involving the new technology of [[electricity]], many potions, tonics, and elixirs.

In the absence of other treatments, bloodletting actually is beneficial in some circumstances, including [[hemochromatosis]], the fluid overload of [[heart failure]], and possibly simply to reduce [[hypertension|blood pressure]]. In other cases, such as those involving agitation, the reduction in blood pressure might appear beneficial due to the sedative effects. In 1844, [[Joseph Pancoast]] listed the advantages of bloodletting in "A Treatise on Operative Surgery". Not all of these reasons are outrageous nowadays:

:The opening of the superficial vessels for the purpose of extracting blood constitutes one of the most common operations of the practitioner. The principal results, which we effect by it, are 1st. The diminution of the mass of the blood, by which the overloaded [[capillary]] or larger [[blood vessel|vessels]] of some affected part may be relieved; 2. The modification of the force and frequency of the heart's action; 3. A change in the composition of the blood, rendering it less stimulating; the proportion of [[blood plasma|serum]] becoming increased after bleeding, in consequence of its being reproduced with greater facility than the other elements of the blood; 4. The production of [[fainting|syncope]], for the purpose of effecting a sudden general relaxation of the system; and, 5. The derivation, or drawing as it is alleged, of the force of the circulation from some of the [[internal organ]]s, towards the open outlet of the superficial vessel. These indications may be fulfilled by opening either a vein or an artery.

==Phlebotomy==
{{Main|Phlebotomy (modern)}}
Today it is well established that bloodletting is not effective for most diseases. Indeed it is mostly harmful, since it can weaken the patient and facilitate infections.
Bloodletting is used today in the treatment of a few diseases, including [[hemochromatosis]] and [[polycythemia]]; however, these rare diseases were unknown and undiagnosable before the advent of scientific medicine. It is practiced by specifically trained practitioners in [[hospital]]s, using modern techniques.
In most cases, phlebotomy now refers to the removal of ''small'' quantities of blood for [[blood tests|diagnostic purposes]]. However, in the case of [[hemochromatosis]], which is now recognized as the most common genetic, or inherited, disorder, frequent bloodletting has become an essential, and life-saving procedure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==In alternative medicine==
Though the effect of bloodletting as a general health measure has been shown to be harmful, the therapy is still routinely used in modern [[alternative medicine]] in [[Unani]], [[Ayurveda]], and [[traditional Chinese Medicine]].<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3377041/ Leech Therapy- A Holistic Approach of Treatment in Unani (Greeko-Arab) Medicine], Anc Sci Life. 2011 Jul-Sep; 31(1): 31–35.
