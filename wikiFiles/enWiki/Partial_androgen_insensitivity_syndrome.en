'''Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome''' (PAIS) is a condition that results in the partial inability of the [[Eukaryote#Animal_cell|cell]] to respond to [[androgen]]s.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The partial unresponsiveness of the cell to the presence of androgenic hormones impairs the [[Development_of_the_reproductive_system#External_genitalia|masculinization of male genitalia]] in the developing fetus, as well as the development of male [[Secondary sex characteristics|secondary sexual characteristics]] at [[puberty]], but does not significantly impair female genital or sexual development.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2002 giwercman 87" />  As such, the insensitivity to androgens is only clinically significant when it occurs in genetic males (i.e. individuals with a [[Y chromosome]], or more specifically, an [[SRY|SRY gene]]).<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />

PAIS is one of three types of [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], which is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of [[Development_of_the_reproductive_system#External_genitalia|genital masculinization]]: [[complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (CAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is that of a normal female, [[mild androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (MAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is that of a normal male, and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is partially, but not fully masculinized.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /><ref name="2010 ozulker 24" /><ref name="2007 davis-dao 92" /><ref name="2005 kawate 90" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" />

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is the largest single entity that leads to 46,XY [[Intersexuality#Conditions|undermasculinization]].<ref name="1999 ahmed 80" />

==Signs and symptoms==
A supplemental system of phenotypic grading that uses seven classes instead of the traditional three was proposed by pediatric [[endocrinologist]] Charmian A. Quigley et al. in 1995.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The first six grades of the scale, grades 1 through 6, are differentiated by the degree of [[Development_of_the_reproductive_system#External_genitalia|genital masculinization]]; grade 1 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully masculinized, grade 6 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully feminized, and grades 2 through 5 quantify four degrees of increasingly feminized genitalia that lie in the interim.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  Grade 7 is indistinguishable from grade 6 until puberty, and is thereafter differentiated by the presence of [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary]] [[terminal hair]]; grade 6 is indicated when secondary terminal hair is present, whereas grade 7 is indicated when it is absent.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The Quigley scale can be used in conjunction with the traditional three classes of AIS to provide additional information regarding the degree of genital masculinization, and is particularly useful when the diagnosis is PAIS.<ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2001 sultan 7" />

[[File:Grade 3 partial androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|''Left'', 19-year-old man with grade 3 PAIS before initiation of androgen therapy. ''Right'', Habitus after 3.5 years of androgen treatment.<ref name="1998 weidemann 83" />]]

Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome is diagnosed when the degree of androgen insensitivity in an individual with a [[karyotype|46,XY karyotype]] is great enough to partially prevent the masculinization of the genitalia, but is not great enough to completely prevent [[Development_of_the_reproductive_system#External_genitalia|genital masculinization]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2008 oakes 21" /><ref name="2008 decaestecker 89" />  This includes any [[phenotype]] resulting from androgen insensitivity where the genitalia is partially, but not completely [[Development_of_the_reproductive_system#External_genitalia|masculinized]].  Genital ambiguities are frequently detected during clinical examination at birth, and consequently, a PAIS diagnosis can be made during infancy as part of a [[differential diagnosis|differential diagnostic workup]].<ref name="1986 lee 255" /><ref name="2008 bhagabath" />

Pubertal undervirilization is common, including [[gynecomastia]], decreased [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary]] [[terminal hair]], and / or a high pitched voice.<ref name="1999 shkolny 84" />  The phallic structure ranges from a [[penis]] with varying degrees of [[Micropenis|diminished size]] and [[hypospadias]] to a slightly enlarged [[clitoris]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  [[Wolffian structures]] (the [[epididymis|epididymides]], [[vas deferens|vasa deferentia]], and [[seminal vesicles]]) are typically partially or fully developed.<ref name="2008 galani 7" />  The [[prostate]] is typically small or impalpable.<ref name="2001 boehmer 86" /><ref name="2002 migeon 110" />  [[Müllerian duct|Müllerian]] remnants are rare, but have been reported.<ref name="1995 tanaka 43" /><ref name="2005 mazur 34" />

The [[gonads]] in individuals with PAIS are [[testes]], regardless of [[phenotype]];<ref name="2008 galani 7" /> during the [[Human embryogenesis|embryonic stage of development]], testes form in an androgen-independent process that occurs due to the influence of the [[SRY|SRY gene]] on the [[Y chromosome]].<ref name="2006 achermann" /><ref name="1995 simpson" />  [[Cryptorchidism]] is common,<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /> and carries with it a 50% risk of [[Germ cell tumor|germ cell malignancy]].<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />  If the testes are located [[scrotum|intrascrotally]], there may still be significant risk of germ cell malignancy; studies have not yet been published to assess this risk.<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />

Predominantly male phenotypes vary in the degree of genital undermasculinization to include [[micropenis]], [[chordee]], [[bifid]] scrotum, and / or [[pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 oakes 21" /><ref name="1997 evans 76" />  [[Impotence]] may be fairly common, depending on phenotypic features; in one study of 15 males with PAIS, 80% of those interviewed indicated that they had some degree of impotence.<ref name="2006 bouvattier 91" />  [[Anejaculation]] appears to occur somewhat independently of impotence; some men are still able to [[ejaculate]] despite impotence, and others without erectile difficulties cannot.<ref name="2001 boehmer 86" /><ref name="2003 melo 88" /><ref name="2008 deeb 93" /><ref name="1997 miller 80" />  Predominantly female phenotypes include a variable degree of [[labial fusion]] and [[clitoromegaly]].<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  Ambiguous phenotypic states include a phallic structure that is intermediate between a clitoris and a penis, and a single perineal orifice that connects to both the urethra and the vagina (i.e. urogenital sinus).<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  At birth, it may not be possible to immediately differentiate the external genitalia of individuals with PAIS as being either male or female,<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2005 kohler 90" /> although the majority of individuals with PAIS are raised male.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />

[[File:Quigley scale for androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|Schematic representation of the Quigley scale. Grades 2 through 5 quantify four degrees of increasingly feminized genitalia that correspond to PAIS. Grades 1 and 6/7 correspond to MAIS and CAIS, respectively.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />]]
Given the wide diversity of phenotypes associated with PAIS, the diagnosis is often further specified by assessing [[Development_of_the_reproductive_system#External_genitalia|genital masculinization]].<ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  Grades 2 through 5 of the Quigley scale quantify four degrees of increasingly feminized genitalia that correspond to PAIS.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />

Grade 2, the mildest form of PAIS, presents with a predominantly male phenotype that presents with minor signs of undermasculinized genitalia, such as isolated [[hypospadias]],<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> which can be severe.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />  Hypospadias may manifest with a partially formed channel from the [[urethra|urethral opening]] to the [[glans]].<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="1992 wooster 2" />  Until recently, it was thought that isolated [[micropenis]] was not a manifestation of PAIS.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />  However, in 2010, two cases of PAIS manifesting with isolated micropenis were documented.<ref name="2010 bhangoo" />

[[File:Grade 4 partial androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|Grade 4 PAIS with [[bifid]] [[scrotum]], microphallus-like [[clitoris]], and [[urethra]]l orifice with terminal sinus urogenitalis<ref name="2008 aguilar-ponce 10" />]]
Grade 3, the most common phenotypic form of PAIS,<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2006 bouvattier 91" /> features a predominantly male phenotype that is more severely undermasculinized, and typically presents with micropenis and [[pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias]] with [[bifid]] [[scrotum]].<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />

Grade 4 presents with a gender ambiguous phenotype, including a phallic structure that is intermediate between a clitoris and a penis.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />  The urethra typically opens into a common channel with the vagina (i.e. urogenital sinus).<ref name="1995 quigley 16" />

Grade 5, the form of PAIS with the greatest degree of androgen insensitivity, presents with a mostly female phenotype, including separate urethral and vaginal [[Body orifice|orifices]], but also shows signs of slight [[Development_of_the_reproductive_system#External_genitalia|masculinization]] including mild [[clitoromegaly]] and / or partial [[labial fusion]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" />

Previously, it was erroneously thought that individuals with PAIS were always infertile; at least one case report has been published that describes fertile men that fit the criteria for grade 2 PAIS ([[micropenis]], penile [[hypospadias]], and [[gynecomastia]]).<ref name="2002 chu 87" />

===Comorbidity===
[[File:Histopathology of androgen insensitivity.jpg|thumb|Histopathology of testicular tissue showing immature germ cells and spermatagonia with decreased tubular diameter. Scattered groups of Leydig cells appearing immature.<ref name="2009 nichols 91" />]]
All forms of androgen insensitivity are associated with [[infertility]], though exceptions have been reported for both the mild and partial forms.<ref name="2002 giwercman 87" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /><ref name="2002 chu 87" /><ref name="2005 menakaya 25" /><ref name="2000 giwercman 85" />

PAIS is associated with a 50% risk of germ cell malignancy when the testes are [[cryptorchidism|undescended]].<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />  If the [[testes]] are located [[scrotum|intrascrotally]], there may still be significant risk of germ cell malignancy; studies have not yet been published to assess this risk.<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />  Some men with PAIS may experience [[sexual dysfunction]] including [[impotence]] and [[anejaculation]].<ref name="2001 boehmer 86" /><ref name="2006 bouvattier 91" /><ref name="2003 melo 88" /><ref name="2008 deeb 93" /><ref name="1997 miller 80" />  A few AR mutations that cause PAIS are also associated with [[prostate cancer|prostate]] <ref name="2003 lund 79" /><ref name="1996 evans 28" /> and [[Male breast cancer|breast]] <ref name="1992 wooster 2" /><ref name="1993 lobaccaro 2" /> cancers.

Vaginal [[hypoplasia]], a relatively frequent finding in CAIS and some forms of PAIS,<ref name="2007 ismail-pratt 22" /><ref name="2010 quint 53" /> is associated with sexual difficulties including vaginal penetration difficulties and [[dyspareunia]].<ref name="2010 quint 53" /><ref name="2003 minto 80" />

At least one study indicates that individuals with an [[intersex]] condition may be more prone to psychological difficulties, due at least in part to parental attitudes and behaviors,<ref name="1998 froukje 27" /> and concludes that preventative long-term [[psychotherapy|psychological counseling]] for parents as well as for affected individuals should be initiated at the time of diagnosis.

Lifespan is not thought to be affected by AIS.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />

==Diagnosis==
{{Main|Androgen insensitivity syndrome#Diagnosis|l1=Diagnosis of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome}}
Unfortunately, the number of [[differential diagnosis|differentials]] to consider for PAIS is particularly large.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />  Prompt diagnosis is particularly urgent when a child is born with [[Intersex#Ambiguous_genitalia|ambiguous genitalia]], as some causes are associated with potentially life-threatening [[Addison's_disease#Addisonian_crisis|adrenal crises]].<ref name="2006 achermann" />  Determination of [[testosterone]], testosterone precursors and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) at baseline and / or after [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) stimulation can be used to exclude such defects in androgen [[biosynthesis]].<ref name="2008 galani 7" />

Approximately one half of all [[karyotype|46,XY individuals]] born with ambiguous genitalia will not receive a definitive diagnosis.<ref name="2002 morel 161" /> [[Androgen receptor]] (AR) gene [[mutations]] cannot be found in 27% <ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2003 melo 88" /> to 72% <ref name="2000 ahmed 85" /> of individuals with PAIS.  As a result, [[genetic analysis]] can be used to confirm a diagnosis of PAIS, but it cannot be used to rule out PAIS.<ref name="2008 hughes 22" />  Evidence of abnormal androgen binding in a genital skin [[fibroblast]] study has long been the [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for the diagnosis of PAIS,<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="1996 weidemann 45" /> even when an AR mutation is not present.<ref name="2002 morel 161" />  However, some cases of PAIS, including AR-mutant-positive cases,<ref name="2008 deeb 93" /> will show normal androgen binding.  A family history consistent with [[X-linked recessive inheritance|X-linked inheritance]] is more commonly found in AR-mutant-positive cases than AR-mutant-negative cases.<ref name="2008 hughes 22" />

The use of dynamic [[endocrine]] tests is particularly helpful in isolating a diagnosis of PAIS.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1999 ahmed 80" />  One such test is the [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) stimulation test.  If the gonads are [[testes]], there will be an increase in the level of serum testosterone in response to the hCG, regardless of [[cryptorchidism|testicular descent]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />  The magnitude of the testosterone increase can help differentiate between androgen resistance and [[gonadal dysgenesis]], as does evidence of a [[uterus]] on [[ultrasound]] examination.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />  Testicular function can also be assessed by measuring serum [[anti-Müllerian hormone]] levels, which in turn can further differentiate PAIS from gonadal dysgenesis and bilateral [[anorchia]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />

Another useful dynamic test involves measuring the response to exogenous steroids; individuals with AIS show a decreased response in [[Serum (blood)|serum]] [[sex hormone binding globulin]] (SHBG) after a short term administration of anabolic steroids.<ref name="1997 sinnecker 156" /><ref name="1989 sinnecker 68" />  Two studies <ref name="1997 sinnecker 156" /><ref name="1989 sinnecker 68" /> indicate that measuring the response in SHBG after the administration of [[stanozolol]] could help to differentiate individuals with PAIS from those with other causes of ambiguous genitalia, although the response in individuals with predominantly male phenotypes overlaps somewhat with the response in normal males.

==Management==
Management of AIS is currently limited to [[symptomatic treatment|symptomatic management]]; methods to correct a malfunctioning [[androgen receptor]] protein that result from an AR gene [[mutation]] are not currently available.  Areas of management include [[sex assignment]], [[genitoplasty]], [[gonadectomy]] in relation to [[germ cell tumor|tumor]] risk, [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]], and [[genetic counseling|genetic]] and [[psychotherapy|psychological counseling]].

The decision of whether to raise an individual with PAIS as a boy or a girl may not be obvious; grades 3 and 4 in particular present with a [[phenotype]] that may be difficult to classify as primarily male or female, and some will be incapable of [[Puberty#Physical_changes_in_boys|virilization]] at [[puberty]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2006 bouvattier 91" /><ref name="2005 kohler 90" />  Parents of an affected newborn should seek immediate help at a center with an experienced multidisciplinary team, and should avoid [[gender assignment]] beforehand.<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />  Gender assignment should thereafter be expeditiously decided; current guidelines advise against waiting for the child to decide for his / herself.<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />  Key considerations involved in assigning gender include the appearance of the [[genitalia]],<ref name="2006 hughes 91" /> the extent to which the child can [[Puberty#Physical_changes_in_boys|virilize]] at puberty,<ref name="2008 galani 7" /> surgical options and the postoperative [[sexual function]] of the genitalia,<ref name="2003 melo 88" /><ref name="2007 ismail-pratt 22" /><ref name="2003 minto 361" /> [[genitoplasty]] complexity,<ref name="2006 hughes 91" /> potential for [[fertility]],<ref name="2006 hughes 91" /> and the projected [[gender identity]] of the child.<ref name="1999 meyer-bahlburg 84" />  The majority of individuals with PAIS are raised male.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" />

[[Puberty#Physical_changes_in_boys|Virilization]] capacity can be assessed by measuring the response to a trial of [[exogenous]] [[androgens]]; some studies have measured the growth of the [[penis|phallus]] in response to exogenous [[testosterone]] <ref name="2005 kohler 90" /> or [[dihydrotestosterone]],<ref name="2002 giwercman 87" /> while others have measured the change in [[sex hormone binding globulin]] (SHBG) in response to the artificial androgen [[stanozolol]] to assess androgen sensitivity.<ref name="1997 sinnecker 156" /><ref name="1989 sinnecker 68" />  Some experts have cautioned that it remains to be proved that a good response to exogenous androgens in [[neonates]] is a good predictor of androgen response at puberty.<ref name="2008 galani 7" />  If a [[mutation]] in the [[androgen receptor|AR]] gene is found, it is important to determine if the mutation is [[heredity|inherited]] or [[Mutation|de novo]] (i.e. a [[somatic mutation]]); a certain amount of the [[wild-type]] androgen receptor will be present in cases of somatic mutation, which can induce virilization at puberty.<ref name="2005 kohler 90" />  A genital skin [[fibroblast]] study <ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="1996 weidemann 45" /> and a [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) stimulation test <ref name="1999 ahmed 80" /> may also provide information helpful in the assessment of virilization capacity.

[[Psychosexual development]] is influenced by many factors, including the timing, amount, and type of androgen exposure, receptor functionality, and environment, and is thus difficult to predict.<ref name="2003 minto 361" /><ref name="1999 meyer-bahlburg 84" /><ref name="1988 goy 22" /><ref name="2005 wallen 26" /><ref name="1992 moore 62" /><ref name="1996 wallen 30" />  [[Gender identity]] begins to develop before 3 years of age,<ref name="2002 martin 128" /> although the earliest age at which it can be reliably assessed has yet to be determined.<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />  Approximately 25% of individuals with PAIS are dissatisfied with their assigned gender, regardless of being raised as male or female.<ref name="2002 migeon 110" />  One study reports that [[karyotype|46,XY individuals]] born with [[micropenis]] and no [[hypospadias]] are better off being raised male, despite the success of some being raised female.<ref name="2001 wisniewski 56" />  Studies involving the more ambiguous [[phenotype|phenotypic]] forms of PAIS are less decisive.<ref name="2002 migeon 110" /><ref name="2006 bouvattier 91" />  [[Homosexuality]] with respect to assigned gender <ref name="2008 oakes 21" /> and [[atypical gender role]] behavior <ref name="2006 hughes 91" /> are known to occur more frequently in individual with PAIS, and may occur with or without [[gender dysphoria]]; neither should be interpreted as an indication of incorrect [[gender assignment]].<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />  If an affected child does express feelings of gender dysphoria, the opportunity to explore such feelings with a psychologist experienced in treating [[intersex]] conditions should be accommodated.<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />  If feelings of gender dysphoria persist, gender reassignment should be initiated, possibly with the aid of a specialist in the field.<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />

[[Genitoplasty]], unlike gender assignment, can be irreversible,<ref name="2008 hughes 22" /> and there is no guarantee that adult gender identity will develop as assigned despite surgical intervention.<ref name="2003 minto 361" />  Some aspects of genitoplasty are still being debated; a variety of different opinions have been presented by professionals, self-help groups, and patients over the last few decades.<ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2002 zucker 15" />  Points of consideration include what conditions justify genitoplasty, the extent and type of genitoplasty that should be employed, when genitoplasty should be performed, and what the goals of genitoplasty should be.<ref name="2002 migeon 110" /><ref name="2006 hughes 91" /><ref name="2003 minto 361" /><ref name="1999 meyer-bahlburg 84" /><ref name="2001 creighton 358" />  Gender assignment itself does not predicate the need for immediate genitoplasty; in some cases, surgical intervention can be delayed to allow the affected child to reach an age and maturity sufficient to have a role in such decisions.<ref name="2008 hughes 22" />  Some studies suggest that early surgeries can still produce satisfactory outcomes,<ref name="2002 migeon 110" /><ref name="2005 warne 18" /> while others suggest it to be unlikely.<ref name="2001 creighton 358" />  Even surgeries that are planned as one-stage procedures often require further major surgery.<ref name="2001 creighton 358" />  Scarring and tissue loss that result from repeated surgical procedures are of particular concern, due to the presumed negative impact on [[sexual function]].<ref name="2002 migeon 110" />

While it is thought that feminizing genitoplasty typically requires fewer surgeries to achieve an acceptable result and results in fewer [[urologic]] difficulties,<ref name="2002 migeon 110" /> there is no evidence that feminizing surgery results in a better [[psychosocial]] outcome.<ref name="2003 minto 361" />  In one study,<ref name="2002 migeon 110" /> individuals with grade 3 PAIS that were raised male rated their body image and sexual function similarly to those that were raised female, even though they were more likely to have genitalia that was abnormal in size and appearance; more than half of the male participants had a stretched penile length that was below 2.5 standard deviations of the mean, while only 6% of female participants presented with a short vagina in adulthood, and participating physicians gave a lower [[Beauty|cosmetic]] rating to the surgical results of the men than the women.  Both male and female participants cited the appearance of their genitalia as being the greatest contributing factor to their dissatisfaction with their [[body image]].  In two larger studies,<ref name="1986 money 12" /><ref name="1987 money 13" /> the common predictor of gender reassignment was [[stigmatization]] related to having an [[intersex]] condition.

The outcome of [[Intersex_surgery#Masculinizing_surgical_procedures|masculinizing genitoplasty]] is dependent on the amount of [[erectile tissue]] and the extent of [[hypospadias]].<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />  Procedures include correction of [[Peyronie's disease|penile curvature]] and [[chordee]], reconstruction of the [[urethra]], [[hypospadias]] correction, [[orchidopexy]], and [[Müllerian system|Müllerian]] remnant removal to prevent infection and pseudo-[[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]].<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2006 nihoul-fekete 175" />  [[Penile prosthesis|Erectile prosthesis]] may be inserted in cases of successful neophalloplasty in adulthood, although it has a high [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]].<ref name="2006 hughes 91" />  Additional surgeries may be required to correct postsurgical complications such as [[stenosis]] of the [[anastomosis]] between the native [[urethra]] and the [[skin graft|graft]], urethral [[fistulas]], and posterior displacement of the [[Urinary meatus|balanic meatus]].<ref name="2006 nihoul-fekete 175" />  Successful masculinizing genitoplasty performed on individuals with grade 3 PAIS often requires multiple surgeries.<ref name="2002 migeon 110" />
