The '''Geisel School of Medicine''' (formerly '''Dartmouth Medical School''') is the [[medical school]] of [[Dartmouth College]], located in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], in the United States. The fourth-oldest [[medical school in the United States]], it was founded in 1797 by [[New England]] physician [[Nathan Smith (physician)|Nathan Smith]] and grew steadily over the course of the 19th century. Several milestones in medical care and research have taken place at Dartmouth, including the first clinical [[X-ray]] (1896), the first [[intensive care unit]] in the United States (1955),<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://dartmed.dartmouth.edu/spring04/html/vs_mosenthal.shtml | title = Remembering Dr. William Mosenthal: A simple idea from a special surgeon | journal = Dartmouth Medicine | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | date = Spring 2004}}</ref> and the [[Brattleboro rat]] (1961).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dms.dartmouth.edu/about/information/milestones.shtml | title = Dartmouth Medical Milestones | publisher = Dartmouth Medical School | accessdate = 2007-12-21 }}</ref>

Today, Dartmouth Medical School continues to grant the [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) degrees, as well as a [[Master of Public Health]] (M.P.H.) and [[Master of Science]] (M.S.) degrees. The school has a student body of about 620 students and more than 2,300 faculty members and researchers. Dartmouth Medical School organizes research through over a dozen research centers and institutes, receiving more than $100 million in grants annually. Dartmouth Medical School is one of seven [[Ivy League]] medical schools and is [[College and university rankings|ranked]] as a "top medical school" by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' for both [[primary care]] and [[biomedical research]]. Dartmouth Medical School has numerous clinical partners, including [[Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center]], White River Junction Veterans Administration Medical Center, and Manchester Veterans Administration Medical Center.

== History ==
[[File:Nathan Smith (physician).jpg|thumb|[[Nathan Smith (physician)|Nathan Smith]], the founder of Dartmouth Medical School.]]

=== Foundation and early years ===
Dartmouth's medical school was founded in 1797 as the fourth medical school in the United States, following the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] (founded 1765), the medical school of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|King's College]] (now [[Columbia University]]) (1767), and [[Harvard Medical School]] (1782).<ref name="jstor">{{cite web | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0028-4866(197306)46%3A2%3C306%3ADMSTF1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Q | title = Review of 'Dartmouth Medical School: The First 176 Years' | work = The New England Quarterly | month = June | year = 1973 | first = Paul Dudley | last = White | pages = 306–308 | accessdate = 2007-12-21 }}</ref> The founder was [[Nathan Smith (physician)|Nathan Smith]], a [[Harvard University]]-educated physician from [[Cornish, New Hampshire]]. Noting the dearth of medical professionals in the rural [[Connecticut River]] [[Upper Valley (Connecticut River)|Upper Valley]] area, Smith petitioned the [[Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College]] in August 1796 to fund the establishment of a medical school to train more physicians for the region. Though [[Dartmouth College]] as a whole was financially strapped, the Board approved the request, and Smith began lecturing on November 22, 1797.<ref name="history">{{cite web | url = http://dms.dartmouth.edu/about/history/history.shtml | title = Two Hundred Years of Medicine at Dartmouth | first = Barbara | last = Blough | coauthors = Dana Cook Grossman | publisher = Dartmouth Medical School | accessdate = 2007-12-21 }}</ref>

For much of its early life, the school consisted only of Nathan Smith and a small class of students, operating in borrowed space at Dartmouth College. Students of Smith were educated as [[apprenticeship|apprentices]], and received a [[Bachelor of Medicine]] degree upon graduation. Like Dartmouth College as a whole, the medical school had continual funding shortages. As time passed, however, the popularity of both the medical instruction and the basic sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike. Soliciting funds from the state of [[New Hampshire]], Smith was able to obtain medical equipment and, by 1811, a dedicated physical plant for the school.<ref name="history" />

Smith acted as the sole administrator and instructor of the medical school until 1810, when a second faculty member was hired. Smith also revamped the curriculum, allowing the school to begin offering the [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) degree in 1812. Smith ultimately left Dartmouth in 1816, founding three additional schools of medicine at [[Yale University]], [[Bowdoin College]], and the [[University of Vermont]].<ref name="history" />

=== Expansion and difficulties ===
Smith's departure provided for a period of expansion, both among the faculty and the student body. Former students of Nathan Smith's replaced him on the faculty, drawing medical professionals in the northeast such as [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] to join them. The first hospital at the school was founded by DMS alumnus Dixi Crosby in 1838, who used it to integrate academic instruction with hands-on patient care. In 1870, Carlton Pennington Frost, DMS '57, replaced Crosby as Dean of the school. Under Frost, the curriculum sustained another revamping, this time into a four-year program that included clinical and academic training.<ref name="history" /> Frost also presided over the establishment of Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in 1893, built to replace Crosby's defunct hospital.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/mhmh/index.html | title = Farewell to the MHMH | work = Darmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-12-21 }}</ref>
[[File:Dartmouth Medical School, early 1900s.jpg|thumb|left|The Dartmouth Medical School campus, from 1915 or earlier.]]
In 1908, [[The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] conducted a survey of medical education institutions in the United States. At the time, the discipline emphasized "bedside teaching" and providing students experience with a broad variety of illnesses and patients. The school's rural location was deemed too remote for proper clinical training, and the school was advised to stop offering the Doctor of Medicine degree and only provide pre-clinical instruction. The class of 1914 was the last (until 1974) to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree; subsequent classes of students attended DMS for two years before transferring to other medical schools. The drop of clinical instruction worsened the school's problems by driving away talented faculty members.<ref name="history" />

After [[World War II]], the tide of the medical discipline had shifted towards research. Although the school was well regarded for preparing students for clinical education at other institutions, its faculty was criticized for its apparent disinterest in research. The school was also criticized for using [[Dartmouth College]]'s undergraduate program as a [[feeder school]].<ref name="jstor" /> Based on these criticisms, DMS was placed on "confidential probation" in 1956 by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] and the Council on Medical Education.<ref name="history" />

=== From the "refounding" to present ===
[[File:Dartmouth College campus_-_view to west from Bartlett Tower, early 1900s.jpg|thumb|Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital (right), circa 1915.]]
At the time of the probation, Dartmouth College had already anticipated the medical school's plight, amassing [[Capital (economics)|capital]] to fund a revitalization of the school. In 1956, the trustees of the College formally agreed to a "refounding" of the school's academic offerings, physical facilities, and faculty. S. Marsh Tenney, DMS class of 1944, was appointed to carry out this task.<ref name="history" /> Tenney more than doubled the size of the faculty and the student body, added several new departments, and oversaw the construction of five new campus buildings by 1964.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/abbldg.html#butler1&2 | title = Butler 1&2 | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/cdbldg.html#danabiomedicallibrary | title = Dana Biomedical Library | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/ghijkbldg.html#kellog | title = Kellogg Auditorium | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/qrsbldg.html#remsen | title = Remsen | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/qrsbldg.html#strasenburgh | title = Strasenburgh Dormitory | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-12-21 }}</ref>

In the 1960s, due to a national shortage of physicians and government [[incentive]]s for schools that increased their class sizes, Dartmouth Medical School graduates began to experience difficulty in trying to transfer to other medical school to complete their final two years of medical school as other medical schools had increased their class size and could not accommodate transfer students.<ref name="jstor" /> In the meantime, Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital had grown to be a 400-bed medical center, and Dartmouth Medical School had established a partnership with a 224-bed Veterans Administration Hospital in [[White River Junction, Vermont]]. The Doctor of Medicine program, now possible with the expanded local medical centers, was reinstated by a vote of the trustees in 1968. The admission of M.D. candidates resumed in 1970.<ref name="history" />  Initially, the medical school curriculum was three years in length, unlike most medical schools, but it later was increased to the usual four years in 1979.<ref>[http://library.dartmouth.edu/cdp/read.php?cdp_id=55 Medicine: History], Dartmouth College Library.  Retrieved 2008-01-07.</ref>

A cooperative program with [[Brown Medical School]] began in 1981 where students received training at both medical schools.<ref>[http://bms.brown.edu/overview/history.html Medical Education at Brown: An Overview], Brown Alpert Medical School.  Retrieved 2008-01-07.</ref>  Fifteen to twenty students were selected for the program, which combined the first two years of basic science coursework at Dartmouth with the final two years of clinical coursework at Brown.  The program balanced Dartmouth's greater basic science facilities than Brown, but fewer clinical facilities than available at the urban setting of Brown, which is located in Providence, Rhode Island.  Graduates of the program received M.D. degrees from Brown.  The program will be discontinued in 2010.<ref>Kelleher, K.

In 1991, the [[Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center]] was established on a {{convert|225|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus in [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]]. The three-year project, completed at the cost of $228 million, served as a replacement for the Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital, which was partially demolished in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dhmc.org/webpage.cfm?site_id=2&org_id=566&morg_id=0&sec_id=0&gsec_id=42&item_id=42 | title = Our History | publisher = Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center | accessdate = 2007-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/mhmh/index.html | title = Farewell to the MHMH | publisher = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-12-21 }}</ref> A new curriculum was introduced in 1996 entitled "New Directions."

In 2012, the medical school was named in honor of Audrey and [[Theodor Geisel]], the most significant philanthropists to Dartmouth in its history.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/news/2012/04/04_geisel.shtml| title = Dartmouth Names Medical School in Honor of Audrey and Theodor Geisel | publisher = Dartmouth College | date = 2012-04-04}}</ref> Theodor "Ted" Geisel, known worldwide as the author and illustrator, "Dr. Seuss," was a Dartmouth graduate of the Class of 1925.
