'''Hypnagogia''' is the experience of the transitional states to and from [[sleep]]: the ''hypnagogic'' and the ''[[hypnopompic]]'' states of consciousness. The related words from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] are ''agōgos'' "leading, inducing", ''pompe'' "act of sending", and ''hypnos'' "sleep".

"Hypnagogia" was coined by Dr Andreas Mavromatis in his 1983 thesis,<ref>(Brunel University) which was later published by Routledge (hardback 1987, paperback 1991) under the title ''"Hypnagogia" the Unique State of Consciousness Between Wakefulness and Sleep'' and reprinted in a new paperback edition in 2010 by Thyrsos Press.</ref> while "hypnagogic" and "hypnopompic" were coined by others in the 1800s. The term "hypnagogic" was originally coined by [[Louis Ferdinand Alfred Maury|Alfred Maury]]<ref>Maury, Louis Ferdinand Alfred (1848)'Des hallucinations hypnagogiques, ou des erreurs des sens dans l'etat intermediaire entre la veille et le sommeil'. ''Annales Medico-Psychologiques du système nerveux'', 11, 26-40.</ref><ref>

"Hypnopompic" was coined by [[Frederic William Henry Myers|Frederic Myers]] soon afterwards to denote the onset of [[wakefulness]]. The term "hypnagogia" is used by Dr Mavromatis to identify the study of the sleep-transitional consciousness states in general, and he employs ''hypnogogic'' (toward sleep) or ''hypnapompic'' (from sleep) for the purpose of identifying the specific experiences under study.<ref>''Hypnagogia'' by Andreas Mavromatis, Thyrsos Press 2010, p.3)</ref> 

Mental phenomena that occur during this "threshold consciousness" phase include [[lucid dreaming]], hallucinations, and [[sleep paralysis]].

==Definitions and synonyms==
Sometimes the word ''hypnagogia'' is used in a restricted [[word sense|sense]] to refer to the onset of sleep, and contrasted with ''[[hypnopompia]]'', [[Frederic William Henry Myers|Frederic Myers]]'s term for waking up.<ref>{{cite book |title=Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death |first=Frederic |last=Myers |publisher=London: Longmans |year= 1903}}</ref> However, ''hypnagogia'' is also regularly employed in a more general sense that covers both falling asleep and waking up, and [[Havelock Ellis]] questioned the need for separate terms.<ref name="mavromatis">{{cite book |title=Hypnagogia: the Unique State of Consciousness Between Wakefulness and Sleep |first=Andreas |last=Mavromatis |publisher=London: Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1987 |page=1 |isbn=0-7102-0282-2}}</ref> Indeed, it is not always possible in practice to assign a particular episode of any given [[phenomenon (science)|phenomenon]] to one or the other, given that the same kinds of [[subjective experience|experience]] occur in both, and that people may drift in and out of sleep. In this article ''hypnagogia'' will be used in the broader sense, unless otherwise stated or implied.

Other terms for hypnagogia, in one or both senses, that have been proposed include "presomnal" or "anthypnic sensations", "visions of half-sleep", "oneirogogic images" and "phantasmata",<ref name="mavromatis"/> "the borderland of sleep", "praedormitium",.<ref name="mavromatis4"/> The "borderland state", "half-dream state", "pre-dream condition",<ref>Lachman, Gary (2002).

Threshold consciousness (commonly called "half-asleep" or "half-awake", or "Mind Awake Body Asleep") describes the same mental state of someone who is moving towards sleep or wakefulness but has not yet completed the transition. Such transitions are usually brief, but can be extended by sleep disturbance or deliberate induction, for example during meditation{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

==History==
Early references to hypnagogia are to be found in the writings of [[Aristotle]], [[Iamblichus]], [[Cardano]], [[Simon Forman]] and [[Swedenborg]].<ref>Mavromatis, op. cit. pp. 3-4.</ref> [[Romanticism]] brought a renewed interest in the subjective experience of the edges of sleep.<ref>Pfotenhauer, Helmut & Schneider, Sabine (2006). ''Nicht völlig wachen und nicht ganz ein Traum: Die Halfschlafbilder in der Literatur''. Verlag Königshausen & Neumann. ISBN 3-8260-3274-8.</ref> In more recent centuries, many authors have referred to the state; [[Edgar Allan Poe]], for example, wrote of the "fancies" he experienced "only when I am on the brink of sleep, with the consciousness that I am so."<ref name="mavromatis4">{{cite book |title=Hypnagogia: the Unique State of Consciousness Between Wakefulness and Sleep |first=Andreas |last=Mavromatis |publisher=London: Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1987 |page=4 |isbn=0-7102-0282-2}}</ref>

Serious scientific enquiry began in the 19th century with [[Johannes Peter Müller]], [[Jules Baillarger]] and [[Louis Ferdinand Alfred Maury|Alfred Maury]], and continued into the twentieth century with Leroy.<ref>Leroy, E.B. (1933). ''Les visions du demi-sommeil''. Paris: Alcan.</ref>

The advent of [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) has supplemented the introspective methods of these early researchers with physiological data. The search for neural correlates for hypnagogic imagery began with Davis et al. in the 1930s,<ref name="Davis, H. 1937">Davis, H., Davis, P.A., Loomis, A.L., Harvey, E.N., & Hobart, G. (1937) 'Changes in human brain potentials during the onset of sleep'. ''Science'' 86, 448–50.</ref> and continues with increasing sophistication to this day. While the dominance of the [[behaviorist]] paradigm led to a decline in research, especially in the English speaking world, the later 20th century has seen a revival, with investigations of hypnagogia and related [[altered state of consciousness|ASCs]] playing an important role in the emerging multidisciplinary study of [[consciousness]].<ref name="mp.uni-tuebingen.de">Vaitl et al. (2005) '[http://www.mp.uni-tuebingen.de/mp/fileadmin/user_upload/Kotchoubey/Vaitl-2005-ASC.pdf Psychobiology of altered states of consciousness]'. ''Psychological Bulletin'' 131:1.</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |title=Consciousness: An Introduction |first=Susan |last=Blackmore |publisher=London: Hodder & Stoughton |year=2003 |isbn=0-340-80909-4}}</ref> Nevertheless, much remains to be understood about the experience and its corresponding neurology, and the topic has been somewhat neglected in comparison with sleep and dreams; hypnagogia has been described as a "well-trodden and yet unmapped territory."<ref>Mavromatis, op. cit., p. xiii.</ref>

Important reviews of the scientific literature have been made by Leaning,<ref>Leaning, F.E. (1925). ''An introductory study of hypnagogic phenomena''.</ref> [[Daniel Schacter|Schacter]],<ref>Schacter, D.L. (1976). The hypnagogic state: A critical review of the literature. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 83, 452–481.</ref> Richardson and Mavromatis.<ref name="mavromatis"/>

==Sensory phenomena==
Transition to and from [[sleep]] may be attended by a wide variety of [[sense|sensory]] experiences. These can occur in any modality, individually or combined, and range from the vague and barely perceptible to vivid [[hallucination]]s.<ref>Mavromatis, op. cit. p. 14.</ref>

===Sights===
Among the more commonly reported,<ref>Hori, T., Hayashi, M., & Morikawa, T. (1993). [[EEG topography|Topographical]] EEG changes and hypnagogic experience. In: Ogilvie, R.D., & Harsh, J.R. (Eds.) Sleep Onset: Normal and Abnormal Processes, pp. 237-53.</ref><ref name="Germaine, A. 1997 p. 243"/> and more thoroughly researched, sensory features of hypnagogia are [[phosphenes]] which can manifest as seemingly random speckles, lines or geometrical patterns, including [[form constants]], or as [[figurative art|figurative]] (representational) [[mental image|images]]. They may be [[monochromatic]] or richly [[color]]ed, still or moving, flat or three-dimensional (offering an impression of [[perspective (visual)|perspective]]). Imagery representing movement through tunnels of light is also reported. Individual images are typically fleeting and given to very rapid changes. They are said to differ from dreams proper in that hypnagogic imagery is usually static and lacking in [[narrative]] content,<ref name="mp.uni-tuebingen.de"/> although others understand the state rather as a gradual transition from hypnagogia to fragmentary dreams,<ref>Lehmann, D., Grass, P., & Meier, B. (1995). 'Spontaneous conscious covert cognition states and brain electric spectral states in canonical correlations'. ''International Journal of Psychophysiology'', 19, 41–52.</ref> i.e., from simple "[[eigengrau|eigenlicht]]" to whole [[imagination|imagined]] scenes. It has been claimed that hypnagogia can be induced with a [[Dreamachine]],<ref>{{cite book

  | page =13 }}</ref> which uses light pulsing at a frequency close to that of alpha waves to create this effect, but this claim has not been tested in scientific experiments. Descriptions of exceptionally vivid and elaborate hypnagogic visuals can be found in the work of [[Marie-Jean-Léon, Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys]].

===Tetris effect===
People who have spent a long time at some repetitive activity before sleep, in particular one that is new to them, may find that it dominates their imagery as they grow [[somnolence|drowsy]], a tendency dubbed the [[Tetris effect]]. This effect has even been observed in [[amnesia]]cs who otherwise have no [[memory]] of the original activity.<ref>Stickgold, R., Malia, A., Maguire, D., Roddenberry, D., & O'Connor, M. (2000). 'Replaying the game: Hypnagogic images in normals and amnesics'. ''Science'', 290(5490), pp. 350–3.</ref> When the activity involves moving objects, as in the video game [[Tetris]], the corresponding hypnagogic images tend to be perceived as moving. The Tetris effect is not confined to visual imagery, but can manifest in other modalities also. For example, [[Robert Stickgold]] recounts having experienced the touch of rocks while falling asleep after mountain climbing.<ref name="transcript"/> This can also occur to people who have traveled on a small boat in rough seas, or have been swimming through waves, shortly before going to bed, and they feel the waves as they drift to sleep, or people who have spent the day skiing who continue to "feel snow" under their feet, also people who have spent considerable time jumping on a trampoline will find that they can feel the up-and-down motion before they go to sleep. Many [[chess]] players report{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} the phenomenon of seeing the chess board and pieces during this state. New employees working stressful and demanding jobs often report doing work-related tasks in this period before sleep. This is very common{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} amongst new waiters or waitresses in busy restaurants where they report having "Server Dreams" and restlessly wait tables in this state of mind, sometimes jolting them fully awake or preventing them from transitioning into actual sleep.

===Sounds===
Hypnagogic hallucinations are often auditory or have an auditory component. Like the visuals, hypnagogic sounds vary in intensity from faint impressions to loud noises, such as crashes and bangs ([[exploding head syndrome]]). People may imagine their own name called or a doorbell ringing. Snatches of imagined [[spoken language|speech]] are common. While typically [[nonsensical]] and fragmented, these speech events can occasionally strike the individual as apt comments on—or summations of—their [[thought]]s at the time. They often contain [[word play]], [[neologism]]s and made-up [[name]]s. Hypnagogic speech may manifest as the subject's own "[[internal monologue|inner voice]]", or as the voices of others: familiar people or strangers. More rarely, [[poetry]] or [[music]] is heard.<ref name="mavromatis81">{{cite book |title=Hypnagogia: the Unique State of Consciousness Between Wakefulness and Sleep |first=Andreas |last=Mavromatis |publisher=London: Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1987 |page=81 |isbn=0-7102-0282-2}}</ref>

===Sleep paralysis===
Humming, roaring, hissing, rushing, zapping, and buzzing noises are frequent in conjunction with [[sleep paralysis]] (SP). This happens when the [[REM atonia]] sets in sooner than usual, before the person is fully asleep, or persists longer than usual, after the person has (in other respects) fully awoken.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Sleep paralysis is reportedly very frequent among [[narcoleptic]]s. It occurs frequently in about 6% of the rest of the population, and occurs occasionally in 60%.<ref>Thorpy, M.J. (ed). (1990). 'Sleep paralysis'. ''ICSD-International Classification of Sleep Disorders: Diagnostic and Coding Manual''. Rochester, Minn.: American Sleep Disorders Association.</ref> In surveys from Canada, China, England, Japan and Nigeria, 20 to 60% of individuals reported having experienced SP at least once in their lifetime.<ref name="Blackmore, Susan J. 2002 pp. 45-59">Blackmore, Susan J. & Parker, Jennifer J. (2002). 'Comparing the Content of Sleep Paralysis and Dream Reports'. ''Dreaming'' 12:1, pp. 45-59.</ref><ref>Spanos, N.P., McNulty, S.A. DuBreuil, S.C. and Pires, M. (1995). 'The frequency and correlates of sleep paralysis in a university sample'. ''Journal of Research in Personality'' 29:3, pp. 285-305.</ref> The paralysis itself is frequently accompanied by additional [[phenomena (philosophy)|phenomena]]. Typical examples include a feeling of being crushed or [[asphyxia|suffocated]], electric "tingles" or "[[vibration]]s", imagined speech and other noises, the imagined presence of a visible or invisible entity, and sometimes intense [[emotion]]: [[fear]] or [[euphoria]] and [[orgasm]]ic feelings.<ref name="Blackmore, Susan J. 2002 pp. 45-59"/><ref>Cheyne, J.A. (2003). 'Sleep Paralysis and the Structure of Waking-Nightmare Hallucinations'. ''Dreaming'' 13:3, pp. 163-79.</ref> SP has been proposed as an explanation for at least some [[alien abduction]] experiences and [[shadow people]] hauntings.<ref>Blackmore, Susan. (1998) '[http://www.csicop.org/si/9805/abduction.html Abduction by Aliens or Sleep Paralysis?]'. ''Skeptical Enquirer'', May/June 1998. (Retrieved 4 July 2008.)</ref>

===Other sensations===
[[Gustatory]], [[olfactory]] and [[thermoception|thermal]] sensations in hypnagogia have all been reported, as well as [[tactile]] sensations (including those kinds classed as [[paresthesia]] or [[formication]]). Sometimes there is [[synesthesia]]; many people report seeing a flash of light or some other visual image in response to a real sound. [[Proprioceptive]] effects may be noticed, with numbness and changes in perceived body size and proportions,<ref name="mavromatis81"/> feelings of floating or bobbing, and [[out-of-body experience]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Out of Body Experiences |first=Robert |last=Petersen |publisher=Hampton Roads Publishing Company, Inc. |year=1997 |isbn= 1-57174-057-0}}</ref> Perhaps the most common experience of this kind is the falling sensation, and associated [[hypnic jerk]], encountered by many people, at least occasionally, while drifting off to sleep.<ref>Oswald, Ian (1959). 'Sudden bodily jerks on falling asleep'. ''Brain'' 82:1, pp. 92-103.</ref>

==Cognitive and affective phenomena==
[[Thought]] processes on the edge of sleep tend to differ radically from those of ordinary wakefulness. Hypnagogia may involve a "loosening of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] boundaries ... openness, sensitivity, internalization-subjectification of the physical and mental environment ([[empathy]]) and diffuse-absorbed [[attention]]."<ref>Mavromatis, op. cit., p. 82.</ref> Hypnagogic [[cognition]], in comparison with that of normal, alert wakefulness, is characterized by heightened [[suggestibility]],<ref>Ellis, Havelock (1897). 'A note on hypnagogic paramnesia'. ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 6:22, 283-287.</ref> illogic and a fluid association of [[idea]]s. Subjects are more receptive in the hypnagogic state to [[suggestion]] from an experimenter than at other times, and readily incorporate external [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] into hypnagogic trains of thought and subsequent dreams. This receptivity has a [[physiological]] parallel; [[EEG]] readings show elevated responsiveness to sound around the onset of sleep.<ref>Mavromatis, op cit., pp. 53-54.</ref>

[[Herbert Silberer]] described a process he called ''autosymbolism'', whereby hypnagogic hallucinations seem to represent, without [[psychological repression|repression]] or censorship, whatever one is thinking at the time, turning abstract [[idea]]s into a concrete [[mental image|image]], which may be perceived as an apt and succinct representation thereof.<ref>Silberer, Herbert (1909). 'Bericht ueber eine Methode, gewisse symbolische Halluzinations-Erscheinungen hervorzurufen und zu beobachten'. ''Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische Forschungen'' 1:2, pp. 513-525; Eng. Transl. by Rapaport D., 'Report on a method of eliciting and observing certain symbolic hallucination phenomena', in Rapaport's ''Organization and pathology of thought'', pp. 195-207 (Columbia Univ. Press, New York 1951.).</ref>

The hypnagogic state can provide [[insight]] into a [[problem]], the best-known example being [[August Kekulé]]’s realization that the structure of [[benzene]] was a closed ring while half-asleep in front of a fire and seeing molecules forming into snakes, one of which grabbed its tail in its mouth.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Creative Cognitive Processes in Kekulé's Discovery of the Structure of the Benzene Molecule |first=Albert |last=Rothenberg |journal=The American Journal of Psychology |pages=419–438 |jstor=1422898 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |volume=108 |number=3 |date=Autumn, 1995}}</ref> Many other [[artist]]s, [[writer]]s, [[scientist]]s and [[inventor]]s—including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Isaac Newton]]—have credited hypnagogia and related states with enhancing their [[creativity]].<ref>Runco, Mark A. & Pritzker, Stephen R. (1999) ''Encyclopedia of Creativity: a-h'', p. 63-4.</ref> A 2001 study by Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] found that, while problems can also be solved in full-blown dreams from later stages of sleep, hypnagogia was especially likely to solve problems which benefit from hallucinatory images being critically examined while still before the eyes.<ref>Barrett, Deirdre The Committee of Sleep (2001) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812932412</ref>

A feature that hypnagogia shares with other stages of sleep is [[amnesia]]. But this is a selective forgetfulness, affecting the [[hippocampal]] memory system, which is responsible for [[episodic memory|episodic]] or [[autobiographical memory]], rather than the [[neocortical]] memory system, responsible for [[semantic memory]].<ref name="transcript"/> It has been suggested that hypnagogia and [[REM sleep]] help in the consolidation of semantic memory,<ref>Stickgold, Robert (1998). 'Sleep: off-line memory reprocessing' Trends in Cognitive Sciences 2:12, pp. 484-92.</ref> but the evidence for this has been disputed.<ref>Vertes, Robert E. & Kathleen, Eastman E. (2000) 'The case against memory consolidation in REM sleep'. Behavioral and Brain ''Behavioural and Brain Sciences'' 23, pp. 867-76.</ref> For example, suppression of [[REM sleep]] due to [[antidepressant]]s and [[lesion]]s to the [[brainstem]] has not been found to produce detrimental effects on cognition.<ref>Vertes, R. (2004) 'Memory Consolidation in SleepDream or Reality'. ''Neuron'' 44:1, pp. 135-48.</ref>

Hypnagogic phenomena may be interpreted as [[hallucination|visions]], [[prophecies]], [[premonitions]], [[apparitional experience|apparitions]] and inspiration ([[artistic inspiration|artistic]] or [[divine inspiration|divine]]), depending on the experiencers' beliefs and those of their culture.

==Physiology==
Physiological studies have tended to concentrate on hypnagogia in the strict sense of spontaneous sleep onset experiences. Such experiences are associated especially with stage 1 of [[NREM sleep]],<ref>Rechtschaffen, A., & Kales, A. (1968). ''A manual of standardized terminology, techniques and scoring system for sleep stages of human subjects''. Washington, DC: Public Health Service, U.S. Government Printing.</ref> but may also occur with pre-sleep [[alpha wave]]s.<ref>Foulkes, D., & Vogel, G. (1965). 'Mental activity at sleep onset'. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'' 70, 231–43.</ref><ref>Foulkes, D., & Schmidt, M. (1983). 'Temporal sequence and unit composition in dream reports from different stages of sleep'. ''Sleep'' 6, 265–80.</ref> Davis et al. found short flashes of dreamlike imagery at the onset of sleep to correlate with drop-offs in alpha [[EEG]] activity.<ref name="Davis, H. 1937"/> Hori et al. regard sleep onset hypnagogia as a state distinct from both wakefulness and sleep with unique [[electrophysiological]], [[behavior]]al and [[subjectivity|subjective]] characteristics,<ref>Hori, T., Hayashi, M., & Morikawa, T. (1993). [[EEG topography|Topographical]] EEG changes and hypnagogic experience. In: Ogilvie, R.D., & Harsh, J.R. (Eds.) ''Sleep Onset: Normal and Abnormal Processes'', pp. 237-53.</ref><ref>Vaitl et al. (2005) [http://www.mp.uni-tuebingen.de/mp/fileadmin/user_upload/Kotchoubey/Vaitl-2005-ASC.pdf 'Psychobiology of altered states of consciousness']. ''Psychological Bulletin'' 131:1.</ref> while Germaine et al. have demonstrated a resemblance between the EEG [[spectral density|power spectra]] of spontaneously occurring hypnagogic images, on the one hand, and those of both [[REM sleep]] and relaxed wakefulness, on the other.<ref>Nielsen, T., Germain, A., & Ouellet, L. (1995). 'Atonia-signalled hypnagogic imagery: Comparative EEG mapping of sleep onset transitions, REM sleep, and wakefulness'. ''Sleep Research'' 24, p. 133.</ref>

To identify more precisely the nature of the EEG state which accompanies imagery in the transition from wakefulness to sleep, Hori et al. proposed a scheme of 9 EEG stages defined by varying proportions of [[alpha wave|alpha]] (stages 1–3), suppressed waves of less than 20μV (stage 4), [[theta wave|theta]] ripples (stage 5), proportions of [[sawtooth]] waves (stages 6–7), and presence of [[sleep spindle|spindles]] (stages 8–9).<ref>Hori, T., Hayashi, M., & Morikawa, T. (1993). Topographical EEG changes and hypnagogic experience. In: Ogilvie, R.D., & Harsh, J.R. (Eds.) ''Sleep Onset: Normal and Abnormal Processes'', pp. 237-53.</ref> Germaine and Nielsen found spontaneous hypnagogic imagery to occur mainly during Hori sleep onset stages 4 (EEG flattening) and 5 (theta ripples).<ref name="Germaine, A. 1997 p. 243">Germaine, A. & Nielsen T.A. (1997). 'Distribution of spontaneous hypnagogic images across Hori's EEG stages of sleep onset'. ''Sleep Research'' 26, p. 243.</ref>

The "covert-rapid-eye-movement" hypothesis proposes that hidden elements of [[REM sleep]] emerge during the wakefulness-sleep transition stage.<ref>Robert Bodizs, Melinda Sverteczki, Alpar Sandor Lazar and Peter Halasz (2005). Human parahippocampal activity: non-REM and REM elements in wake-sleep transition. ''Brain Research Bulletin'' 65:2, pp. 169-76.</ref> Support for this comes from Bódicz et al., who note a greater similarity between WST (wakefulness-sleep transition) EEG and REM sleep EEG than between the former and stage 2 sleep.<ref name="sciencedirect.com"/>

[[Respiratory]] pattern changes have also been noted in the hypnagogic state, in addition to a lowered rate of [[frontalis muscle]] activity.<ref>Schacter, Daniel L. (1976). 'The hypnagogic state: A critical review of the literature'. ''Psychological Bulletin'', Vol 83:3, pp. 452-481.</ref>

==Daydreaming and waking reveries==
[[Microsleep]] (short episodes of immediate sleep onset) may intrude into wakefulness at any time in the wakefulness-sleep cycle, due to [[sleep deprivation]] and other conditions,<ref>Oswald, I. (1962). ''Sleeping and waking: Physiology and psychology''. Amsterdam: Elsevier.</ref> resulting in impaired cognition, amnesia.<ref name="mp.uni-tuebingen.de"/>

Gurstelle and Oliveira distinguish a state which they call ''daytime parahypnagogia'' (DPH), the spontaneous intrusion of a flash image or dreamlike thought or insight into one's waking consciousness. DPH is typically encountered when one is "[[fatigue (medical)|tired]], [[bored]], suffering from [[directed attention fatigue|attention fatigue]], and/or engaged in a passive activity." The exact nature of the episode may be forgotten even though the individual remembers having had such an experience.<ref>Gurstelle, E.B. & Oliveira, J.L. (2004) 'Daytime parahypnagogia: a state of consciousness that occurs when we almost fall asleep'. ''Medical Hypotheses'' 62:2, pp. 166-8.</ref> Gustelle and Oliveira define DPH as "dissociative, [[trance]]-like, [...] but, unlike a [[daydream]], [...] not self-directed"—however, daydreams and waking reveries are often characterised as "passive", "effortless",<ref>Runco, Mark A. & Pritzker, Stephen R. (1999) ''Encyclopedia of Creativity: a-h'', p. 64.</ref> and "spontaneous",<ref name="mp.uni-tuebingen.de"/> while hypnagogia itself can sometimes be influenced by a form of [[autosuggestion]], or "passive concentration",<ref>Mavromatis, op. cit., p. 73, etc.</ref> so these sorts of episode may in fact constitute a continuum between directed fantasy and the more spontaneous varieties of hypnagogia. Others have emphasized the connections between fantasy, daydreaming, dreams and hypnosis.<ref>Singer, Jerome L. & Pope, Kenneth, S. (1981) 'Daydreaming and imagery skills as predisposing capacities for self-hypnosis'. ''International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis'', 29:3, pp. 271-81.</ref>

In his book, ''[[Zen and the Brain]]'', [[James H. Austin]] cites speculation that regular meditation develops a specialized skill of "freezing the hypnagogic process at later and later stages" of the onset of sleep, initially in the alpha wave stage and later in theta.<ref>Austin, James H.(1999) ''Zen and the Brain: Toward an Understanding of Meditation and Consciousness''. First MIT Press paperback edition, 1999. MIT Press. ISBN 0-262-51109-6, p. 92.</ref>

==Investigative methodology==
Self-observation (spontaneous or systematic) was the primary tool of the early researchers. Since the late twentieth century, this has been joined by questionnaire surveys and experimental studies. All three methods have their disadvantages as well as points to recommend them.<ref>Mavromatis, op. cit., p. 286.</ref>

Naturally, amnesia contributes to the difficulty of studying hypnagogia, as does the typically fleeting nature of hypnagogic experiences. These problems have been tackled by experimenters in a number of ways, including voluntary or induced interruptions,<ref name="Germaine, A. 1997 p. 243"/> sleep manipulation,<ref name="blackmore312"/> the use of techniques to "hover on the edge of sleep" thereby extending the duration of the hypnagogic state,<ref name="blackmore312">{{cite book |title=Consciousness: An Introduction |first=Susan |last=Blackmore |publisher=London: Hodder & Stoughton |year=2003 |page=314 |isbn=0-340-80909-4}}</ref> and training in the art of introspection to heighten the subject's powers of observation and attention.<ref name="blackmore312"/>

Techniques for extending hypnagogia range from informal ones (e.g., the subject holds up one of their arms as they go to sleep, so as to be awakened when it falls),<ref name="blackmore312"/> to the use of biofeedback devices to induce a "[[theta waves|theta]]" state, characterized by relaxation and theta [[electroencephalogram|EEG]] activity.<ref>Mavromatis, op. cit. p. 93.</ref> The theta state is produced naturally the most when we are dreaming. It has also been linked to paranormal activities, and [[Rick Strassman]] has argued that it triggers the release of DMT from the pineal gland, causing a dreaming state.<ref>DMT: The Spirit Molecule, Rick Strassman</ref>

Another method is to induce a state said to be subjectively similar to sleep onset in a [[Ganzfeld effect|Ganzfeld]] setting, a form of [[sensory deprivation]]. But the assumption of identity between the two states may be unfounded. The average EEG spectrum in Ganzfeld is more similar to that of the relaxed waking state than to that of sleep onset.<ref>Wackermann, Jiri, Pütz, Peter, Büchi, Simone, Strauch, Inge & Lehmann, Dietrich (2000). 'A comparison of Ganzfeld and hypnagogic state in terms of electrophysiological measures and subjective experience'. ''Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association'', pp. 302-15.</ref> Wackerman et al. conclude that "the Ganzfeld imagery, although subjectively very similar to that at sleep onset, should not be labeled as 'hypnagogic'. Perhaps a broader category of 'hypnagoid experience' should be considered, covering true hypnagogic imagery as well as subjectively similar imagery produced in other states."<ref>Wackermann et al., op. cit.</ref>
