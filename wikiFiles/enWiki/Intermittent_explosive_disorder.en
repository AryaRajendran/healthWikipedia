'''Intermittent explosive disorder''' ('''IED''') is a behavioral disorder characterized by extreme expressions of [[anger]], often to the point of uncontrollable rage, that are disproportionate to the situation at hand.  It is currently categorized in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] as an [[impulse control disorder]]. IED belongs to the larger family of [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#Multi-axial system|Axis I]] impulse control disorders listed in the DSM-IV-TR, along with [[kleptomania]], [[pyromania]], [[pathological gambling]], and others.<ref>{{cite book |author= |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |pages= [http://books.google.com/books?id=3SQrtpnHb9MC&pg=PA663 663–7]|isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Impulsive aggression is unpremeditated, and is defined by a disproportionate reaction to any provocation, real or perceived.  Some individuals have reported affective changes prior to an outburst (e.g., [[Stress (biology)|tension]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] changes, energy changes, etc.).<ref name=McElroy>{{cite journal |author=McElroy SL |title=Recognition and treatment of DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=60 Suppl 15 |issue= |pages=12–6 |year=1999 |pmid=10418808 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

A 2006 study suggests that the disorder is considerably more prevalent than previously thought.  In a study of almost 10,000 individuals 18 years or older, lifetime episodes were reported at 7.3%, while 12-month occurrences were reported at 3.9%.  This suggests a mean lifetime occurrence of 43 instances, with an average of $1359 in property damage.<ref name = Kessler2006>{{cite journal |author=Kessler RC, Coccaro EF, Fava M, Jaeger S, Jin R, Walters E |title=The prevalence and correlates of DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication |journal=Arch.

A 2005 study conducted in the U.S. [[State of Rhode Island]] found the prevalence to be 6.3% (SE, +/- 0.7%) for lifetime DSM-IV IED in a study of 1300 patients under psychiatric evaluation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coccaro EF, Posternak MA, Zimmerman M |title=Prevalence and features of intermittent explosive disorder in a clinical setting |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=10 |pages=1221–7 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16259534 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v66n1003|url=http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&ID=10001473}}</ref>  Prevalence is higher in men than in women.<ref name=Boyd>{{cite book |author=Boyd, Mary Ann |title=Psychiatric nursing: contemporary practice |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages= [http://books.google.com/books?id=L7zqhrxLp3MC&pg=PA820 820–1] |isbn=0-7817-9169-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  The disorder itself is not easily characterized and often exhibits comorbidity with other mood disorders, particularly [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name=27cases>{{cite journal |author=McElroy SL, Soutullo CA, Beckman DA, Taylor P, Keck PE |title=DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder: a report of 27 cases |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=203–10; quiz 211 |year=1998 |month=April |pmid=9590677 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v59n0411|url=}}</ref> Individuals diagnosed with IED report their outbursts were brief (lasting less than an hour), with a variety of bodily symptoms (sweating, chest tightness, twitching, [[palpitation]]s) reported by a third of one sample.  The violent acts were frequently reported accompanied by a sensation of relief, and in some cases, pleasure, but accompanied by [[remorse]] after the fact.

== Diagnosis  ==
The DSM-IV criteria for IED include: the occurrence of discrete episodes of failure to resist aggressive impulses that result in violent assault or destruction of property, the degree of aggressiveness expressed during an episode is grossly disproportionate to provocation or precipitating psychosocial stressor, and, as previously stated, diagnosis is made when other mental disorders that may cause violent outbursts (e.g., [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]], [[oppositional defiant disorder]], etc.) have been ruled out.  Furthermore, the acts of aggression must not be due to a general medical condition, e.g., a head injury, [[Alzheimer's disease]], etc., or due to [[substance abuse]] or medication.<ref name=27cases/>  Diagnosis is made using a psychiatric interview to affective and behavioral symptoms to the criteria listed in the DSM-IV.
The DSM IV-TR is very specific in its definition of Intermittent Explosive Disorder which is defined, essentially, by exclusion of other conditions. The diagnosis requires:
# several episodes of impulsive behavior that result in serious damage to either persons or property, wherein
# the degree of the aggressiveness is grossly disproportionate to the circumstances or provocation, and
# the episodic violence cannot be better accounted for by another mental or physical medical condition.

== Treatment ==	
Treatment is attempted through both [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and psychotropic medication regimens, though the pharmaceutical options have shown limited success.<ref name="McCloskey">McCloskey, M.S., Noblett, K.L., Deffenbacher, J.L, Gollan, J.K., Coccaro, E.F. (2008) Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Intermittent Explosive Disorder: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial. 76(5), 876-886.</ref>  Therapy aids in helping the patient recognize the impulses in hopes of achieving a level of awareness and control of the outbursts, along with treating the emotional stress that accompanies these episodes.  Multiple drug regimens are frequently indicated for IED patients. Cognitive Relaxation and Coping Skills Therapy (CRCST) has shown preliminary success in both group and individual settings compared to waitlist control groups.<ref name="McCloskey" /> This therapy consists of 12 sessions, the first three focusing on relaxation training, then [[cognitive restructuring]], then [[exposure therapy]]. The final sessions focus on resisting aggressive impulses and other preventative measures.<ref name="McCloskey" />   

[[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs) such as [[fluoxetine]], [[fluvoxamine]], and [[sertraline]] appear to alleviate some pathopsychological symptoms; the reasons for such will be explained further in the subsequent section.<ref name=McElroy /><ref>Goodman, W. K., Ward, H., Kablinger, A., & Murphy, T. (1997). Fluvoxamine in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Related Conditions. J Clin Psychiatry, 58(suppl 5), 32-49.</ref>  GABAergic [[mood stabilizer]]s and anticonvulsive drugs such as [[gabapentin]], [[lithium]], [[carbamazepine]], and [[divalproex]] seem to aid in controlling the incidence of outbursts.<ref name=McElroy /><ref name=Boyd /><ref>Bozikas, V., Bascilla, F., Yulis, P., & Savvidou, I.

Impulsive behavior, and especially impulsive violence predisposition has been correlated to a low brain [[serotonin]] turnover rate, indicated by a low concentration of [[5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] (5-HIAA) in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF).  This [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] appears to act on the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] in the [[hypothalamus]], which is the target for serotonergic output from the dorsal and median [[raphe nuclei]] playing a role in maintaining the [[circadian rhythm]] and regulation of [[blood sugar]].  A tendency towards low 5-HIAA may be [[Heredity|hereditary]].  A putative hereditary component to low CSF 5-HIAA and concordantly possibly to impulsive violence has been proposed.  Other traits that [[Correlation|correlate]] with IED are low vagal tone and increased [[insulin]] secretion.  A suggested explanation for IED is a [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] of the [[gene]] for [[tryptophan hydroxylase]], which produces a serotonin [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]]; this [[genotype]] is found more commonly in individuals with impulsive behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Virkkunen M, Goldman D, Nielsen DA, Linnoila M |title=Low brain serotonin turnover rate (low CSF 5-HIAA) and impulsive violence |journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=271–5 |year=1995 |month=July |pmid=7544158 |pmc=1188701 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
	
IED may also be associated with [[lesions]] in the [[prefrontal cortex]], with damage to these areas, including the [[amygdala]], increasing the incidence of impulsive and aggressive behavior and the inability to predict the outcomes of an individual's own actions.  Lesions in these areas are also associated with improper blood sugar control, leading to decreased brain function in these areas, which are associated with planning and decision making.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Best M, Williams JM, Coccaro EF |title=Evidence for a dysfunctional prefrontal circuit in patients with an impulsive aggressive disorder |journal=Proc.
