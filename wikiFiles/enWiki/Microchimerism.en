'''Microchimerism''' (abbreviated '''Mc''') is the presence of a small number of cells that originate from another individual and are therefore genetically distinct from the cells of the host individual. This phenomenon may be related to certain types of [[autoimmune diseases]]; however, the mechanisms responsible for this relationship are unclear.

==Types of microchimerism==

===Human===
In humans (and perhaps in all [[Placentals]]) the most common form is '''fetomaternal microchimerism''' (also known as fetal cell microchimerism or fetal chimerism) whereby cells from a [[fetus]] pass through the [[placenta]] and establish cell lineages within the mother. Fetal cells have been documented to persist and multiply in the mother for several decades.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bianchi|first=DW|coauthors=Zickwold GK, Weil GJ, Sylvester S, DeMaria MA.|title=Male fetal progenitor cells persist in maternal blood for as long as 27 years postpartum|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|year=1996|volume=93|pages=705–708|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.2.705|pmc=40117|issue=2|pmid=8570620}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite journal|author= Evans PC, Lambert N, Maloney S, Furst DE, Moore JM, Nelson JL | title=Long-term fetal microchimerism in peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets in healthy women and women with scleroderma| journal=Blood | year=1999 | pages=2033–2037 | volume=93|pmid= 10068676|issue= 6}}</ref> The exact [[phenotype]] of these cells is unknown, although several different cell types have been identified, such as various immune lineages, [[mesenchymal stem cells]], and placental-derived cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pritchard|first=Stephanie|coauthors=Wick HC, Slonim DK, Johnson KL, Bianchi DW|title=Comprehensive analysis of genes expressed by rare microchimeric fetal cells in the maternal mouse lung|journal=Biology of Reproduction|year=2012|month=August|volume=87|pages=42|pmid=22674387|url=http://www.biolreprod.org/content/87/2/42.long}}</ref>  The potential health consequences of these cells are currently unknown. One hypothesis is that these fetal cells might trigger a [[Graft-versus-host disease|graft-versus-host reaction]] leading to [[autoimmune disease]].  This offers a potential explanation for why many autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in middle-aged women.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=JL|title=Maternal-fetal immunology and autoimmune disease: is some autoimmune disease auto-alloimmune or allo-autoimmune?|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=1996|volume=39|issue=2|pages=191–194|doi=10.1002/art.1780390203|pmid=8849367}}</ref>  The other main theory is that fetal cells home to injured or diseased maternal tissue where they act as [[stem cells]] and participate in repair.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Khosrotehrani|first=K|coauthors=Johnson KL, Cha DH, Salomon RN, Bianchi DW|title=Transfer of fetal cells with multilineage potential to maternal tissue|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|year=2004|volume=292|pages=75–80|doi=10.1001/jama.292.1.75|pmid=15238593|issue=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Nguyen Huu|first=S|coauthors=Oster M, Avril MF, Boitier F, Mortier L, Richard MA, Kerob D, Maubec E, Souteyrand P, Moguelet P, Khosrotehrani K, Aractingi S.|title=Fetal microchimeric cells participate in tumour angiogenesis in melanomas occurring during pregnancy|journal=Am J Cardiovasc Pathol|year=2009|volume=174|pages=630–637}}</ref>  It is also possible that the fetal cells are merely innocent bystanders and have no effect on maternal health.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=KL|coauthors=Bianchi DW|title=Fetal cells in maternal tissue following pregnancy: what are the consequences?|journal=Hum Reprod Update|year=2004|volume=10|issue=6|pages=497–502|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmh040|pmid=15319378}}</ref>

After giving birth, about 50-75% of women carry fetal immune cell lines. Maternal immune cells are also found in the offspring yielding in '''maternal→fetal microchimerism''', though this phenomenon is about half as frequent as the former .<ref name="labinvest">{{cite journal|author= Loubičre LS, Lambert NC, Flinn LJ, Erickson TD, Yan Z, Guthrie KA, et al. | title=Maternal microchimerism in healthy adults in lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages and NK cells| journal= Lab Invest | year=2006| volume=86 | pages=1185–92|pmid= 16969370|issue= 11|doi= 10.1038/labinvest.3700471 }}</ref>

Microchimerism had also been shown to exist after [[blood transfusion]]s to a severely [[immunocompromised]] population of patients who suffered [[Physical trauma|trauma]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Reed W, Lee TH, Norris PJ, Utter GH, Busch MP | title=Transfusion-associated microchimerism: a new complication of blood transfusions in severely injured patients| journal=Seminars in Hematology | year=2007 | pages=24–31 | volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1053/j.seminhematol.2006.09.012 | pmid=17198844}}</ref>

===Animal===
Microchimerism occurs in most pairs of twins in [[cattle]].  In cattle (and other [[Bovinae|bovine]]s), the [[placenta]]e of fraternal twins usually fuse and the twins share blood circulation, resulting in exchange of cell lines.  If the twins are a male-female pair, the male hormones from the bull calf have the effect of partially masculinising the heifer (female), creating a ''martin heifer'' or ''[[freemartin]]''.  Freemartins appear female, but are infertile and so cannot be used for breeding or [[dairy farming|dairy production]].  Microchimerism provides a method of diagnosing the condition, because male genetic material can be detected in a blood sample.<ref>[http://www.theriojournal.com/article/0093-691X(95)00039-B/abstract A.

==Relationship with autoimmune diseases and breast cancer==
Microchimerism has been implicated in autoimmune diseases. Independent studies repeatedly suggested that microchimeric cells of fetal origin may be involved in the pathogenesis of [[systemic sclerosis]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>{{cite journal|author= Artlett CM, Smith JB, Jimenez SA | title=Identification of fetal DNA and cells in skin lesions from women with systemic sclerosis| journal=New England Journal of Medicine| year=1998 | pages=1186–1196|issue= 17|pmid= 9554859 | volume=338|doi= 10.1056/NEJM199804233381704 | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/338/17/1186}}</ref>  Moreover, microchimeric cells of maternal origin may be involved in the pathogenesis of a group of autoimmune diseases found in children, i.e. juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (one example would be [[juvenile dermatomyositis]]).<ref>{{cite journal|author= Artlett CM, Ramos R, Jimenez SA, Patterson K, Miller FW, Rider LG | title=Chimeric cells of maternal origin in juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.

Moreover, fetal immune cells have also been frequently found in breast cancer stroma as compared to samples taken from healthy women. It is not clear, however, whether fetal cell lines promote the development of tumors or, contrarily, protect women from developing breast carcinoma.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Gadi VK, Nelson JL | title=Fetal microchimerism in women with breast cancer| journal=Cancer Research | year=2007| pages=9035–9038 | volume=67|doi= 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4209|pmid= 17909006|issue= 19 | url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/67/19/9035}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author= Dubernard G et al. | title=Breast cancer stroma frequently recruits fetal derived cells during pregnancy| journal=Breast Cancer Research | year=2008| pages=R14 | volume=10|doi= 10.1186/bcr1860|pmid= 18271969|issue= 1|pmc= 2374970 | url=http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/10/1/R14#B38}}</ref>
