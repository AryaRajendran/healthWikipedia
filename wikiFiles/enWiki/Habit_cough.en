A '''habit cough''' (also known as '''psychogenic cough''' and '''pseudoasthma''') is a [[cough]] that may develop in [[children]] after a [[common cold|cold]] or other airway [[irritation|irritant]].<ref name=Review10>{{cite journal |author=Goldsobel AB, Chipps BE |title=Cough in the pediatric population |journal=J. Pediatr. |volume=156 |issue=3 |pages=352–358.e1 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20176183 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2009.12.004 |url=}}</ref>

==Indications==
Habit cough is characterized by a small, harsh tinny type sound, and becomes persistent for weeks to months.  The cough's hallmarks are severe frequency, often a cough every 2–3 seconds, and the lack of other [[symptoms]] such as [[fever]].  The [[diagnosis]] is made when the child falls asleep and the cough stops completely.  Any other [[Pathology (disambiguation)|pathologic]] cough will not totally stop at night.  The child can have trouble falling asleep but once asleep will not cough.

==Treatment==
The treatment does not involve [[medicine]]s. [[Cough medicine]]s, even [[opioid]] ones are ineffective as are [[inhaler]]s or [[steroid]]s.  The child will often begin to miss school and other activities due to the cough.  Most of the time these children are not psychologically abnormal, but the cough can be a source of secondary gain.

Successful treatments have involved self-[[hypnosis]], [[speech therapy]], and a brief course of suggestion therapy outlined in the ''Annals of Allergy'', Volume 67, December 1991, pp.&nbsp;579–83 (Lokshin, MD, et al.) With suggestion therapy, the patient was given a distractor (lidocaine nebulizer) while being told by a physician ([[authority figure]]) that he/she can control the cough with this exercise, and that the cough is just vicious cycle where the initial irritant that caused the cough is gone but the urge to cough continues the irritation.

Then starting with 3 seconds the child is asked to hold the cough for that amount of time. After success the amount of time the child is asked to hold his breath is increased to 5 seconds, 10 seconds, etc. up to 60 seconds.  When the child gets to 60 seconds usually the desire to cough is gone and the child congratulated on controlling the cough. Follow-up sessions can be done at home with the parent using chloroseptic spray as the distractor. In the study in the ''Annals of Allergy'', some children who coughed for months were stopped in one session. If short therapy does not work refer the child to a [[psychologist]].
