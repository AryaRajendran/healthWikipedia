'''Bubonic plague''' is a [[zoonotic disease]], circulating mainly among small rodents and their [[flea]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allcountries.org/health/plague.html |title=Plague, Overview |work=Health Topics A to Z |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref> and is one of three types of bacterial infections caused by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' (formerly known as ''Pasteurella pestis''), which belongs to the family [[Enterobacteriaceae]]. Without treatment, the bubonic plague kills about two thirds of infected humans within 4 days.

The term ''bubonic plague'' is derived from the Greek word [[wikt:βουβών|βουβών]], meaning "groin." Swollen [[lymph node]]s (buboes) especially occur in the armpit and groin in persons suffering from bubonic plague. ''Bubonic plague'' was often used synonymously for plague, but it does in fact refer specifically to an infection that enters through the skin and travels through the [[lymphatics]], as is often seen in [[flea]]-borne infections.

Bubonic plague—along with the [[septicemic plague]] and the [[pneumonic plague]], which are the two other manifestations of ''[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]''—is generally believed to be the cause of the [[Black Death]] that [[Black Death migration|swept through Europe]] in the 14th century and killed an estimated 25 million people, or 30–60% of the European population.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001134 | title = Distinct Clones of Yersinia pestis Caused the Black Death | journal = PLoS Pathogens | editor1-first = Nora J. | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = e1001134 | date = 2010-09 | editor1-last = Besansky | first = Stephanie | last = Haensch | pmid = 20949072 | coauthors = Raffaella Bianucci, Michel Signoli, Minoarisoa Rajerison, Michael Schultz, Sacha Kacki,, Marco Vermunt, Darlene A.

Furthermore, on the basis of 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms plus the absence of a deletion in glpD gene, our aDNA results identified two previously unknown but related clades of Y. pestis associated with distinct medieval mass graves. These findings suggest that plague was imported to Europe on two or more occasions, each following a distinct route. These two clades are ancestral to modern isolates of Y. pestis biovars Orientalis and Medievalis. Our results clarify the etiology of the Black Death and provide a paradigm for a detailed historical reconstruction of the infection routes followed by this disease.}}</ref> Because the plague killed so many of the working population, wages rose and some historians have seen this as a turning point in European economic development.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bowsky, William |title=The Black Death: A Turning Point in History? |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1971 |isbn=978-0-03-085000-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bridbury, A.R. |title=Economic Growth: England in the Later Middle Ages |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-313-24066-9}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Acral necrosis due to bubonic plague.jpg|thumb|Acral [[Tissue necrosis|necrosis]] of the nose, the lips, and the fingers and residual [[Ecchymosis|ecchymoses]] over both forearms in a patient recovering from bubonic plague that disseminated to the blood and the lungs. At one time, the patient's entire body was ecchymotic. Reprinted from [[Textbook of Military Medicine]].]]

The most infamous symptom of bubonic plague is  an infection of the lymph glands ([[lymphadenitis]]),  which become swollen and painful and are known as [[buboes]]. After being transmitted via the bite of an infected flea the ''Y. pestis'' bacteria become localized in an inflamed [[lymph node]] where they begin to colonize and reproduce. Buboes associated with the bubonic plague are commonly found in the armpits, upper femoral, groin and neck region. Acral gangrene (i.e. of the fingers, toes, lips and nose), is another common symptom.  

Due to its bite-based form of infection, the bubonic plague is often the first step of a progressive series of illnesses. Bubonic plague symptoms appear suddenly, usually 2–5 days after exposure to the bacteria. Symptoms include:
*[[Gangrene|Acral gangrene]]: Gangrene of the extremities such as toes, fingers, lips and tip of the nose.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10807389 | volume=283 | issue=17 | title=Plague as a biological weapon: medical and public health management. Working Group on Civilian Biodefense | year=2000 | month=May | author=Inglesby TV, Dennis DT, Henderson DA, ''et al.'' | journal=JAMA | pages=2281–90 | doi=10.1001/jama.283.17.2281}}</ref> 
*[[Chills]]
*General ill feeling ([[malaise]])
*High fever (39 °Celsius; 102 °Fahrenheit)
*Muscle Cramps<ref>{{cite web|title=Plague|url=http://www.itriagehealth.com/disease/plague-(bacteria-yersinia-infection)|publisher=Healthagen, LLC|accessdate=4/1/11}}</ref> 
*[[Seizures]]
*Smooth, painful lymph gland swelling called a bubo, commonly found in the groin, but may occur in the armpits or neck, most often at the site of the initial infection (bite or scratch)
*Pain may occur in the area before the swelling appears
*Skin color changes to a pink hue in some very extreme cases

Other symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood ([[hematemesis]]), aching limbs, coughing, and extreme pain. The pain is usually caused by the decay or decomposition of the skin while the person is still alive. Additional symptoms include extreme fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, lenticulae (black dots scattered throughout the body), delirium and [[coma]].

Two other types of ''[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]'' plague are pneumonic and septicemic. [[Pneumonic plague]], unlike the bubonic or septicemic, induces coughing and is very infectious, allowing it to be spread person to person.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Flea infected with yersinia pestis.jpg|thumb|[[Oriental rat flea]] (''Xenopsylla cheopis'') infected with the ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' [[Bacteria|bacterium]] which appears as a dark mass in the gut. The foregut of this flea is blocked by a Y. pestis [[biofilm]]; when the flea attempts to feed on an uninfected [[Host (biology)|host]] ''Y. pestis'' from the foregut is [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitated]] into the wound, causing [[infection]].]]

Bubonic plague is an infection of the [[lymphatic system]], usually resulting from the bite of an infected flea, ''[[Xenopsylla cheopis]]'' (the rat flea). In very rare circumstances, as in the [[septicemic plague]], the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. The fleas are often found on rodents such as rats and mice, and seek out other prey when their rodent hosts die. The bacteria began its life harmlessly living in the digestive tracts of mammals. The ability to propagate was dependent only upon its ability to travel from mammal host to mammal host. The bacteria remained harmless to the flea, allowing the new host to spread the bacteria. The bacteria form aggregates in the gut of infected fleas and this results in the flea regurgitating ingested blood, which is now infected, into the bite site of a rodent or human host. Once established, bacteria rapidly spread to the [[lymph node]]s and multiply. 

''[[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]'' [[bacilli]] can resist phagocytosis and even reproduce inside [[phagocytes]] and kill them. As the disease progresses, the lymph nodes can [[haemorrhage]] and become swollen and [[Necrosis|necrotic]]. Bubonic plague can progress to lethal [[septicemic plague]] in some cases. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the [[pneumonic plague]], This form of the disease is highly communicable as the bacteria can be transmitted in droplets emitted when coughing or sneezing.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Treatment==
Several classes of [[antibiotics]] are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include [[aminoglycoside]]s such as [[streptomycin]] and [[gentamicin]], [[tetracyclines]] (especially [[doxycycline]]), and the [[fluoroquinolone]] [[ciprofloxacin]]. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1-15%, compared to a mortality rate of 40-60% in untreated cases.<ref>{{cite web

}}
</ref>

People potentially infected with the plague need immediate treatment and should be given antibiotics within 24 hours of the first symptoms to prevent death. Other treatments include oxygen, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support. People who have had contact with anyone infected by pneumonic plague are given prophylactic antibiotics.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plague|url=http://www.itriagehealth.com/disease/plague-(bacteria-yersinia-infection)|publisher=Healthagen, LLC|accessdate=4 April 2011}}</ref>  Using the broad-based antibiotic streptomycin has proven to be dramatically successful against the bubonic plague within 12 hours of infection.<ref name="autogenerated2002">Echenberg,Myron (2002). Pestis Redux: The Initial Years of the Third Bubonic Plague Pandemic, 1894-1901. Journal of World History,vol 13,2</ref>

==Laboratory testing==
Laboratory testing is required in order to [[Medical diagnosis|diagnose]] and confirm plague. Ideally, confirmation is through the identification of ''Y. pestis'' [[Microbiological culture|culture]] from a patient sample. Confirmation of infection can be done by examining [[Blood serum|serum]] taken during the early and late stages of [[infection]]. To quickly screen for the ''Y. pestis'' [[antigen]] in patients, rapid [[dipstick]] tests have been developed for field use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allcountries.org/health/plague.html |title=Plague, Laboratory testing |work=Health Topics A to Z |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>

==History==

===Early outbreaks===

{{Main|Plague of Justinian|Black Death|Third plague pandemic}}
The first recorded epidemic ravaged the [[Byzantine Empire]] during the sixth century, and was named the [[Plague of Justinian]] after emperor [[Justinian I]], who was infected but survived through extensive treatment.<ref>Little (2007), pp. 8-15.</ref><ref>McCormick (2007), pp. 290-312.</ref>
The epidemic is estimated to have killed approximately 50 million people in the Roman Empire alone.<ref name="autogenerated1">Moorshead Magazines, Limited. "The Plague Of Justinian." History Magazine 11.1 (2009): 9-12. History Reference Center</ref> The historian Procopius wrote, in Volume II of History of the Wars, his encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire. In the spring of 542, the plague arrived in Constantinople, working its way from port city to port city and spreading through the Mediterranean, later migrating inland eastward into Asia Minor and west into Greece and Italy. Because the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinian’s efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies, his capital became the leading exporter of the Bubonic plague. [[Procopius]], in his work ''Secret History'', declared that Justinian was a demon of an emperor who either created the plague himself or was being punished for his sinfulness.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===Black Death===
{{main|Black Death}}
In the [[Late Middle Ages]] (1340-1400) Europe experienced the most deadly disease outbreak in Western history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347, killing a third of the human population. It is commonly believed that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare, crime, popular revolt, waves of flagellants, and persecution.<ref>Cohn, Samuel K.(2002). The Black Death: End of a Paradigm. American Historical Review, vol 107, 3, pg 703-737</ref>  The Black Death originated in or near China and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries. Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in the spring of 1346 in the steppe region, where a plague reservoir stretches from the north-western shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia. The Mongols had cut off the trade route, the [[Silk Road]], between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe. The epidemic began with an attack that [[Mongol]]s launched on the Italian merchant's last trading station in the region, [[Caffa]] in the [[Crimea]].<ref name="autogenerated2002"/> In the autumn of 1346, plague broke out among the [[siege|besiegers]] and from them penetrated into the town. When spring arrived, the Italian merchants fled on their ships, unknowingly carrying the Black Death. Carried by the fleas on rats, the plague initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another.

There were many ethno-medical beliefs of prevention methods for avoiding the Black Death.  One of the most famous ideas was that by walking around with flowers in or around their nose people would be able to "ward off the stench and perhaps the evil that afflicted them."  There were also many religious prevention methods.  One such method used was to carve the symbol of the cross onto the front door of a house with the words "Lord have mercy on us" near it.<ref>{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://wordfocus.com/word-black-death-pt2.html |title=Mee Jr, Charles L. (2011). "The Black Death, a bubonic plague of great dimensions-part 2." Word Focus |publisher=Wordfocus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref>

[[Pistoia]], a city in Italy, even went as far as enacting rules and regulations on the city and its inhabitants to keep it safe from the Black Death.  The rules stated that no one was allowed to   visit any plague-infected area and if they did they were not allowed back into the city.  Some other rules were that no linen or woollen goods were to be imported into the city and no corpses were to be buried in the city.  However, despite strict enforcement of the rules, the city eventually became infected.<ref>{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://wordfocus.com/word-black-death-pt2.html |title=Mee Jr., Charles L.

While Europe was devastated by the disease, the rest of the world fared much better. In India, populations rose from a population of 91 million in 1300, to 97 million in 1400, to 105 million in 1500. Also sub-Saharan Africa remained largely unaffected by the plagues.<ref>Reaching Out: Expanding Horizons of Cross-Cultural Interaction</ref>

===Traditional treatment===
{{main|Miasma theory}}
Medieval doctors thought the plague was created by air corrupted by humid weather, decaying unburied bodies, and fumes produced by poor sanitation. The recommended treatment of the plague was a good diet, rest, and relocating to a non-infected environment so the individual could get access to clean air. This did help, but not for the reasons the doctors of the time thought.  In actuality, because they recommended moving away from unsanitary conditions, people were, in effect, getting away from the rodents that harbored the fleas carrying the infection. However, this also helped to spread the infection to new areas previously non-infected.

===Later outbreaks===
[[File:Directions for searchers, Pune plague of 1897.jpg|thumb|upright|Directions for searchers, [[Third Pandemic#Political impact in Colonial India|Poona (now Pune) plague]] of 1897]]   

The next few centuries were marked by several local outbreaks of lesser severity. The [[Great Plague of Seville]] (1647), the [[Great Plague of London]] (1665–1666), the [[Great Plague of Vienna]] (1679), [[Great Plague of Riga]] (1710) and the [[Great Plague of Marseilles]] (1720), were the last major outbreaks of the bubonic plague in Europe.

The plague resurfaced in the mid-19th century; like the Black Death, the [[Third plague pandemic|Third Pandemic]] began in [[Central Asia]]. The disease killed millions in China and India — mostly a British possession at the time — and then spread worldwide. The outbreak continued into the early 20th century. In 1897, the city of [[Poona]] (now [[Pune]]) in [[India]] was severely affected by the outbreak. 

In 1899, the islands of Hawaii were also hit by the plague.<ref>[http://news.discovery.com/human/black-death-plague-china.html Discovery News Website, retrieved on December 6, 2011]</ref> The first evidence of the disease was found in Honolulu's Chinatown on Oahu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiforvisitors.com/oahu/events/chinatown-honolulu-fire.htm |title=Hawaii for Visitors, retrieved on December 6, 2011 |publisher=Hawaiiforvisitors.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref>  It was located very close to the island's piers, and rats in cargo ships from China were able to land on the Hawaiian islands unseen. As the rats, hosts for disease-carrying fleas, made their way deeper into the city, people started to fall ill. On December 12, 1899, the first case was confirmed. The Board of Health then quickly thought of ways to prevent the disease from spreading even further  inland. Their solution was to burn down any buildings in Chinatown suspected of containing a source of the disease. On December 31, 1899, the board set the first fire. They had originally planned to burn only a few targeted buildings, and thought they could control the flames as each building was finished, but the fire got out of control, burning down un-targeted neighboring buildings. The resulting fire caused many of Chinatown's homes to be destroyed and an estimated 4,000 people were left homeless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/150/sesq2plagueandfire |title=The Honolulu Advertiser, retrieved on December 6, 2011 |publisher=The.honoluluadvertiser.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref>

Australia suffered 12 major plague outbreaks between 1900 and 1925 originating from shipping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/museum/mwmuseum/index.php/Bubonic_Plague_comes_to_Sydney_in_1900|title=Bubonic Plague comes to Sydney in 1900|year=2012|work=Sydney Medical School - Online Museum|publisher=[[University of Sydney]]|location=|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> Research by Australian medical officers [[John Ashburton Thompson|Thompson]], Armstrong and [[Frank Tidswell|Tidswell]] contributed to understanding the spread of ''Yersinia pestis'' to humans by fleas from infected rats.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=J.

In 1994, a [[1994 plague in India|plague outbreak in five Indian states]] caused an estimated 700 infections (including 52 deaths) and triggered a large migration of Indians within India as they tried to avoid the plague. 

In 1994 and 2010 cases were reported in Peru.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=361749&CategoryId=14095 |title=One Dead from Plague in Northern Peru |publisher=Laht.com |date= |accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref>  In 2010 a case was reported in [[Oregon]], United States.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Nogueras |url=http://news.opb.org/article/14656-rare-case-bubonic-plague-shows-lake-county/ |title=Rare Case Of Bubonic Plague Shows Up In Lake County |publisher=News.opb.org |date=1 October 2010 |accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref>

In September 2012 a herdsman in China ([[Sichuan province]], [[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]]) was reported to have died of the disease after finding a dead [[marmot]] and eating it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/732646.shtml |title=GlobalTimes.cn |publisher=GlobalTimes.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref>

==Biological warfare==
Some of the earliest instances of biological warfare were said to have been product of the plague, as armies of the 14th century were recorded catapulting diseased corpses over the walls of towns and villages in order to spread the pestilence. 

Later, plague was used during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] as a [[Bacteriological warfare|bacteriological weapon]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. These weapons were provided by [[Shirō Ishii]]'s [[Unit 731|units]] and used in experiments on humans before being used on the field. For example, in 1940, the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] bombed [[Ningbo]] with fleas carrying the bubonic plague.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-triggered-bubonic-plague-outbreak-doctor-claims-704147.html ''Japan triggered bubonic plague outbreak, doctor claims'']</ref><ref>[http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/wwii.html A time-line of World War II, Scaruffi Piero. Prince [[Tsuneyoshi Takeda]] and [[Prince Mikasa]] received a special screening by [[Shirō Ishii]] of a film showing imperial planes loading germ bombs for bubonic dissemination over Ningbo in 1940. (Daniel Barenblatt, ''A Plague upon Humanity'', 2004, p.32.)]</ref> During the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]], the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that, in 1941, some 40 members of [[Unit 731]] air-dropped [[Plague (disease)|plague]]-contaminated fleas on [[Changde]]. These operations caused epidemic plague outbreaks.<ref>Daniel Barenblatt, ''A Plague upon Humanity.'', 2004, pages 220–221.</ref>
