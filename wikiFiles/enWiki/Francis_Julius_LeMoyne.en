== Crematory ==
{{main|LeMoyne Crematory}}
Fearing that decomposing bodies in local cemeteries were contaminating the water supplies and making the citizens sick,<ref>[http://www.wchspa.org/html/crematory.htm wchspa.org]</ref> Dr. Lemoyne set out to build the first crematory in the United States.  The crematory was finished in 1876 on his own land, perched atop a location known locally as Gallow's Hill. The first cremation took place on December 6, 1876.  In 1901, after 41 more cremations were performed (with Dr. LeMoyne being the third), the crematory was closed.

Today, the structure can be found in the same location off of South Main Street.
