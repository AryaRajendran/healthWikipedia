Colorectal polyps are often classified by their behaviour (i.e. benign vs. malignant) and/or etiology (e.g. as a consequence of [[inflammatory bowel disease]]).
They may be benign (e.g. hyperplastic polyp), pre-malignant (e.g. [[:image:Tubular adenoma high mag.jpg|tubular adenoma]]) or malignant (e.g. colorectal adenocarcinoma).

==Types==
The most common general classification is:
* hyperplastic,
* neoplastic (adenomatous & malignant),
* hamartomatous and,
* inflammatory.

===Hyperplastic polyp===

Most hyperplastic polyps are found in the [[distal]] [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and [[rectum]].<ref name="Robbins polyps">{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease.|year=2010|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4160-3121-5|edition=8th ed.|chapter=17 - Polyps|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-1-4377-0792-2..50022-5--cesec238&isbn=978-1-4377-0792-2&uniqId=278090687-4#4-u1.0-B978-1-4377-0792-2..50022-5--f46}}</ref> They have no malignant potential,<ref name="Robbins polyps" /> which means that they are no more likely than normal tissue to eventually become a cancer.

Hyperplastic polyps are serrated polyps.  Hyperplastic polyps have three [[histology|histologic]] patterns of growth: microvesicular, goblet cell and mucin poor.

''Hyperplastic polyposis syndrome'' is a rare condition that has been defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as either:
:#Five or more hyperplastic polyps [[proximal]] to the [[sigmoid colon]], with two polyps greater than 10mm in diameter; or
:#Any number of hyperplastic polyps proximal to the sigmoid colon in a person with a [[first degree relative]] who has hyperplastic polyposis syndrome; or
:#More than 30 hyperplastic polyps of any size throughout the colon and rectum.<ref name=Sternberg/>

Although thought to exhibit no malignant potential it has been shown that hyperplastic polyps on the right side of the colon do exhibit a malignant potential.  This occurs through multiple mutations which effect the DNA-mismatch-repair pathways.  As such DNA mutations during replication are not repaired.  This leads to microsatellite instability which can eventually lead to malignant transformation in polyps on the right side of the colon.

===Neoplastic polyp===
A [[neoplasm]] is a tissue whose cells have lost its normal [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. They can be either benign growths or malignant growths. The malignant growths can either have primary or secondary causes.

==== Adenomas ====

Neoplastic polyps of the bowel are often benign hence called adenomas. An adenoma is tumor glandular tissue, that has not (yet) gained the properties of a cancer.

The common adenomas of the colon are the [[Tubular adenoma|tubular]], [[Tubulovillous adenoma|tubulovillous]], [[Villous adenoma|villous]], and [[Sessile serrated adenoma|sessile serrated]] (SSA).<ref name="Robbins polyps" />

As is evident from their name, sessile serrated and traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) have a serrated appearance and can be difficult to distinguish microscopically from hyperplastic polyps.<ref name="Robbins polyps" /> Making this distinction is important, however, since SSAs and TSAs have the potential to become cancers,<ref name="Sternberg">{{cite book |author=Stoler, Mark A.; Mills, Stacey E.; Carter, Darryl; Joel K Greenson; Reuter, Victor E. |title=Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7942-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  while hyperplastic polyps do not.<ref name="Robbins polyps" />

The villous subdivision are associated with the highest malignant potential because they generally have the largest surface area. (This is because the villi are projections into the lumen and hence have a bigger surface area.) However, villous adenomas are no more likely than tubular or tubulovillous adenomas to become cancerous if their sizes are all the same.<ref name="Robbins polyps" />

===Hamartomatous polyp===
They are growths, like tumours found in organs as a result of faulty development. They are normally made up of a mixture of tissues. They grow at the normal rate of the host tissue and rarely cause problems such as compression. A common example of a hamartomatous lesion is a [[strawberry naevus]]. Hamartomatous polyps are often found by chance; occurring in syndromes such as Peutz-Jegher Syndrome or Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome.

''[[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]]'' is associated with polyps of the GI tract and also increased pigmentation around the lips, genitalia, buccal mucosa feet and hands. People are often diagnosed with Peutz-Jegher after presenting at around the age of 9 with an intussusception. The polyps themselves carry little malignant potential but because of potential coexisting adenomas there is a 15% chance of colonic malignancy.

''Juvenile polyps'' are hamartomatous polyps which often become evident before twenty years of age, but can also be seen in adults.  They are usually solitary polyps found in the [[rectum]] which most commonly present with rectal bleeding. [[Juvenile polyposis syndrome]] is characterised by the presence of more than five polyps in the colon or rectum, or numerous juvenile polyps throughout the [[gastrointestinal tract]], or any number of juvenile polyps in any person with a family history of juvenile polyposis.  People with juvenile polyposis have an increased risk of colon cancer.<ref name = Sternberg/>

===Inflammatory polyp===
These are polyps which are associated with inflammatory conditions such as [[Ulcerative Colitis]] and [[Crohns disease]].

==Symptoms==
Colorectal polyps are not usually associated with symptoms.<ref name="Medline" /> When they occur, symptoms include [[Fecal occult blood|rectal bleeding]], [[Blood in stool|bloody stools]], [[abdominal pain]] and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref name="Medline" /> A change in bowel habits may occur including [[constipation]] and [[diarrhoea]].<ref name="mayo">{{cite web

 | date =2007-07-16
 | url =http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/colon-polyps/DS00511/DSECTION=1
 | accessdate =2007-10-25 }}</ref> Occasionally, if a polyp is big enough to cause a [[bowel obstruction]], there may be [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] and severe constipation.<ref name="mayo" />

==Screening and diagnosis==
Colorectal polyps can be detected using a [[faecal occult blood]] test, flexible [[sigmoidoscopy]], [[colonoscopy]], [[virtual colonoscopy]], [[digital rectal examination]], [[barium enema]] or a [[pill camera]].<ref name="mayo" />

===When does a polyp become a problem?===
Malignant potential is associated with
* degree of [[dysplasia]]
* Type of polyp (e.g. [[villous adenoma]]):
** Tubular Adenoma: 5% risk of cancer
** Tubulovillous adenoma: 20% risk of cancer
** Villous adenoma: 40% risk of cancer
* Size of polyp:
** <1&nbsp;cm =<1% risk of cancer{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
** 1&nbsp;cm=10%risk of cancer{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
** 2&nbsp;cm=15%risk of cancer{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Normally an adenoma which is greater than 0.5&nbsp;cm is treated

==Treatment==
Polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy using a wire loop that cuts the stalk of the polyp and [[cauterise]]s it to prevent bleeding.<ref name="mayo" /> Many "defiant" polyps&nbsp;— large, flat, and otherwise laterally spreading [[adenomas]]&nbsp;— may be removed [[endoscope|endoscopically]] by a technique called endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), which involves injection of fluid underneath the lesion to lift it and thus enable facilitate surgical excision. These techniques may be employed as an alternative to a much-more-invasive [[colectomy]].<ref>[http://www.omed.org/downloads/pdf/publications/how_i_doit/2007/omed_hid_removing_large_or_sessile_colonic_polyps.pdf "How I Do It"&nbsp;— Removing large or sessile colonic polyps].

==Structure==
Polyps are either pedunculated (attached to the intestinal wall by a stalk) or sessile (grow directly from the wall).<ref name="MC">{{cite book
