'''Monoamniotic twins''' are [[identical twins]] that share same [[amniotic sac]] within their mother’s [[uterus]].<ref name=pregnancy-info>[http://www.pregnancy-info.net/monoamniotic.html Pregnancy-Info -- > Monoamniotic Twins] Retrieved on July 9, 2009</ref> Monoamniotic twins are always identical, and always [[monochorionic]] as well (sharing the same [[placenta]]), and are sometimes termed '''Monoamniotic-Monochorionic''' ("MoMo") twins.<ref name=pregnancy-info/> They also share the [[placenta]], but have two separate [[umbilical cords]]. Monoamniotic twins develop when an embryo does not split until after formation of the amniotic sac,<ref name=pregnancy-info/> at about 9 days after [[fertilization]].<ref name=Shulman>{{cite book |author=Shulman, Lee S.; Vugt, John M.

==Occurrence==
Monoamniotic twins are rare, with an occurrence of 1 in 35,000 to 1 in 60,000 pregnancies,<ref name=pregnancy-info/> corresponding to about 1% of twin pregnancies.<ref name=about/>

==Complications==
The survival rate for monoamniotic twins has been shown to be as high as 81%<ref>Hack KE, Derks JB, Schaap AH, Lopriore E, Elias SG, Arabin B, et al. Perinatal Outcome of Monoamniotic Twin Pregnancies. Obstet Gynecol. 2009;113(2, Part 1):353-60 http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2009/02000/Perinatal_Outcome_of_Monoamniotic_Twin_Pregnancies.17.aspx</ref> to 95%<ref>Baxi LV, Walsh CA.

*[[Cord entanglement]]: The close proximity and absence of amniotic membrane separating the two umbilical cords makes it particularly easy for the twins to become entangled in each other’s cords, hindering fetal movement and development.<ref name=about/> Additionally, entanglement may cause one twin to become stuck in the birth canal during [[Childbirth|labor]] and expulsion.<ref name=pregnancy-info/>  Cord entanglement happens to some degree in almost every monoamniotic pregnancy.<ref name=pregnancy-info/>
* [[Umbilical cord compression|Cord compression]]: One twin may compress the other’s umbilical cord, potentially stopping the flow of nutrients and blood and resulting in fetal death.<ref name=pregnancy-info/><ref name=about/>
* [[Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]] (TTTS): One twin receives the majority of the nourishment, causing the other twin to become undernourished. TTTS is much more difficult to diagnose in monoamniotic twins than diamniotic ones, since the standard method otherwise is to compare the fluid in the sacs. Rather, TTTS diagnosis in monoamniotic twins relies on comparing the physical development of the twins.<ref name=pregnancy-info/>

==Diagnosis==
Ultrasound is the only way to detect MoMo twins before birth.<ref name=about/> It can show the lack of a membrane between the twins after a couple of weeks' gestation, when the membrane would be visible if present.<ref name=about/>

Further ultrasounds with high resolution [[doppler imaging]] and [[non-stress test]]s help to assess the situation and identify potential cord problems.<ref name=about/>

There is a correlation between having a single [[yolk sac]] and having a single amniotic sac.<ref name=pregnancy-info/> However, it is difficult to detect the number of yolk sacs, because the yolk sac disappears during [[embryogenesis]].<ref name=pregnancy-info/> 

Cord entanglement and compression generally progress slowly, allowing parents and medical caregivers to make decisions carefully.<ref name=about/>

==Treatment==
Only a few treatments can give any improvements. 

[[Sulindac]] has been used experimentally in some monoamniotic twins, lowering the amount of amniotic fluid and thereby inhibiting fetal movement. This is believed to lower the risk of cord entanglement and compression. However, the potential side effects of the drug have been insufficiently investigated.<ref name=pregnancy-info/><ref name=about/>

Regular and aggressive fetal monitoring is recommended for cases of monoamniotic twins to look for cord entanglement beginning after viability. Many women enter [[inpatient]] care, with continuous monitoring,<ref name=pregnancy-info/> preferably in the care of a [[perinatologist]], an obstetrician that specialises in high risk pregnancies.<ref name=about/>

All monoamniotic twins are delivered prematurely by [[cesarean section]], since the risk of cord entanglement and/or cord compression becomes too great in the third trimester. The cesarean is usually performed at 32, 34 or 36 weeks.<ref name=about/> Many monoamniotic twins experience life-threatening complications as early as 26 weeks, motivating immediate delivery. However, delivery around 26 weeks is associated with life-threatening complications of [[preterm birth]].<ref name=pregnancy-info/> Steroids may be administered to stimulate the babies' lung development<ref name=about/> and decrease the risk of [[infant respiratory distress syndrome]]. Vaginal birth rather than cesarean section causes [[cord prolapse]], with the first baby delivered pulling the placenta shared with the baby being left inside.
