'''Scaphocephaly''' (Pronunciation: skaf-O-sef-aly), derived from the Greek skaphe (a light boat or skiff), describes a specific variety of a long narrow head<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000094763|scaphocephaly}}</ref> that resembles an inverted boat.

It is a type of [[cephalic disorder]] which occurs when there is a premature fusion of the [[sagittal suture]]. The sagittal suture joins together the two parietal bones of skull. Scaphocephaly is the most common of the [[craniosynostosis]] conditions and is characterized by a long, narrow head. 

==Treatment==
This condition can only be corrected by surgery if young enough.
