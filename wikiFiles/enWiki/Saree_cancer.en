'''Saree cancer''' is a type of [[skin cancer]] that occurs along the [[waistline]] in females wearing the [[saree]], caused by constant irritation which can result in scaling and changes in pigmentation of the skin. It is a rare type of cancer and generally found in the [[Indian subcontinent]], where the saree is a lifetime female costume.<ref name="TOI sari cancer">{{cite news|last=Mathai|first=Kamini|title=Sari cancer poses threat to women: Doctors|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Sari-cancer-poses-threat-to-women-Doctors/articleshow/11678915.cms|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=30 January 2012}}</ref> It is similar to [[Marjolin's ulcer]] in etiology, involving [[chronic inflammation]].

==Etiology==

The [[saree]] is common female attire in the Indian subcontinent. It is a piece of long (generally {{convert|5.5|m|ft|link=yes}}) cloth which can be made of various materials: [[cotton]], [[silk]], [[nylon]], [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]] or [[synthetic fabric]]. It is worn over an inner skirt (petticoat) which is tightened around the waist by a thick cotton cord. This is the traditional costume of most Indian women. The saree is attached to the waist throughout the day in the hot and humid climate. The waist is often soiled with dust and sweat and remains without proper cleaning. This causes changes in pigmentation and mild scaling over the waist. This, in turn, causes chronic irritation and gradually [[malignancy]] may develop in the skin at the waistline.<ref name="JCDR article">{{cite journal|last=Lal|first=S|title=Saree Cancer: The Malignant  Changes in Chronic Irritation|journal=Journal of clinical and diagonostic research|url=http://www.jcdr.org.in/Upload/4333/4333_030612_4333_Rev2.pdf|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=IJBMR>{{cite journal|last=Kamble|first=Ashok Sundarrao|title=Saree Cancer&nbsp;– A Case Report|journal=International Journal of Biological & Medical Research|year=2012|volume=3|series=2|pages=1540–1541|url=http://www.biomedscidirect.com/journalfiles/IJBMRF2012548/saree_cancer_a_case_report.pdf}}</ref><ref name="pmid22666941">{{cite journal |author=Bakhshi GD, Borisa A, Tayade MB |title=Waist cancer: report of two cases |journal=J Indian Med Assoc |volume=109 |issue=11 |pages=829, 831 |year=2011 |month=November |pmid=22666941 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The foremost symptoms of saree cancer is the constant irritation with scaling and pigmentation change at the waistline; gradually these become chronic. The person may have non-healing [[ulcer]] or a hyper- or hypopigmented patch or a growth-like lesion over the waistline. The lesion may be associated with [[serous]] discharge with foul smell.<ref name="JCDR article" /><ref name=IJBMR />

==Management==
Excision biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis of saree cancer. In many cases local excision with [[skin grafting]] is considered the appropriate treatment.<ref name="JCDR article" /><ref name=IJBMR /><ref name="TOI sari cancer" />
Different ways of wearing the petticoat may help saree-wearers to prevent saree cancer. Some such strategies are:
* Loosening the petticoat
* Changing the usual rope-like belt to broader ones that reduce pressure on the area
* Continuously changing the level at which the petticoat is tied<ref name="TOI sari cancer" />

==History of the disease==
[[File:Five_tamil_women_with_Azhiyar_dam_in_background.jpg|thumb|Women commonly wear the saree for their entire lifetime]]
In 1945 physicians Khanolkar and Suryabai described a new type of skin cancer with hypopigmented and thickened scars which were more likely to progress into malignant lesions. They termed it "dhoti cancer", the [[dhoti]] being a traditional male costume of India which like the saree is wrapped around the waist. The term "saree cancer" was first used by a group of doctors led by Dr. A.S. Ptil from Bombay Hospital, India, in the ''Bombay Hospital Journal''. The dermatological problem in the waist of Indian women wearing sarees had been recognised before by some other researchers. This type of cancer is now related to [[Marjolin's ulcer]], the malignant degeneration of a chronic wound which was described by [[Jean-Nicolas Marjolin]] in 1828.<ref name="JCDR article" /><ref name=IJBMR />
