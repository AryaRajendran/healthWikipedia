The '''neuromuscular junction''' connects the [[nervous system]] to the [[muscular system]] via [[synapse]]s between [[efferent nerve fiber]]s and [[muscle fiber]]s, also known as muscle cells. As an [[action potential]] reaches the end of a [[motor neuron]], [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s open allowing calcium to enter the neuron. Calcium facilitates [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] binding and subsequent [[neurotransmitter]] release from the motor neuron into the [[synaptic cleft]]. In [[vertebrates]], motor neurons release [[acetylcholine]] (ACh), a small molecule neurotransmitter, which diffuses through the synapse and binds [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s (nAChRs) on the plasma membrane of the muscle fiber, also known as the [[sarcolemma]].   nAChRs are [[ionotropic]], meaning they serve as [[ligand]] gated [[ion channels]].  The binding of ACh to the receptor can depolarize the muscle fiber, causing a cascade that eventually results in muscle contraction.

Neuromuscular junction diseases can be of [[genetic disorder|genetic]] and [[autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] origin.  Genetic disorders, such as [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], can arise from mutated structural proteins that comprise the neuromuscular junction, whereas autoimmune diseases, such as [[myasthenia gravis]], occur when antibodies are produced against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the sarcolemma.

==Structure==

===Neuromuscular junction===

The '''neuromuscular junction''' differs from [[synapse]]s between neurons. Presynaptic motor axons are demyelinated and stop 30 nanometers from the [[sarcolemma]], the cell membrane of a muscle cell. This 30-nanometer space forms the [[Chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]] through which signaling molecules are released.  The sarcolemma has [[invagination]]s called postjunctional folds, which increase the surface area of the membrane exposed to the synaptic cleft.<ref name="Text">{{cite book |author=Nicholls, John G., |coathors=A. Robert Martin, Paul A. Fuchs, David A. Brown, Matthew E. Diamond, and David A. Weisblat |title=From Neuron to Brain |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland |year=2012 |edition=5th }}</ref>  These postjunctional folds form what is referred to as the motor end-plate, which possesses [[acetylcholine receptor]]s (AChRs) at a density of 10,000 receptors/micrometer<sup>2</sup> in [[Skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]].<ref name="Sine">{{cite journal |author=Sine SM |title=End-plate acetylcholine receptor: structure, mechanism, pharmacology, and disease |journal=Physiol. Rev. |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=1189–234 |year=2012 |month=July |pmid=22811427 |pmc=3489064 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00015.2011 |url=http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=22811427}}</ref>  The presynaptic axons form bulges called [[terminal boutons]] that project into the postjunctional folds of the sarcolemma.  The presynaptic boutons have active zones that contain vesicles, quanta, full of acetylcholine molecules.  These vesicles can fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release ACh molecules into the synaptic cleft via [[exocytosis]] after depolarization.<ref name="Text" />
AChRs are localized opposite the presynaptic terminals by protein scaffolds at the postjunctional folds of the sarcolemma.  [[Dystrophin]], a structural protein, connects the sarcomere, sarcolemma, and extracellular matrix components.  [[Rapsyn]] is another protein that docks AChRs and structural proteins to the cytoskeleton.  Also present is the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] protein MuSK, a signaling protein involved in the development of the neuromuscular junction, which is also held in place by rapsyn.<ref name="Text" />

===Acetylcholine receptor===

[[Acetylcholine]] is a [[neurotransmitter]] synthesized in the human body from dietary [[choline]] and [[acetyl-CoA]] (ACoA), and it is involved in the stimulation of [[vertebrate]] muscle tissue.  The eukaryotic [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] (AChR) is a [[ligand-gated ion channel]].  Each subunit has a characteristic “cys-loop,” which is composed of a [[cysteine]] residue followed by 13 [[amino acid]] residues and another cysteine residue. The two cysteine residues form a [[disulfide bond|disulfide linkage]] which results in the “cys-loop” receptor that is capable of binding acetylcholine and other ligands.  These cys-loop receptors are found only in [[eukaryotes]], but [[prokaryotes]] possess ACh receptors with similar properties.<ref name="Sine" />  Not all species use a [[cholinergic]] neuromuscular junction; in fact, crayfish have a [[glutamic acid|glutamatergic]] neuromuscular junction.<ref name="Text" />

AChRs at the skeletal neuromuscular junction form heteropentamers comprised of two α, one β, one γ, and one δ subunits.  When a single ACh ligand binds to one of the α subunits of the ACh receptor it induces a [[conformational change]] at the interface with the second AChR α subunit.  This conformational change results in the increased [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] of the second α subunit for a second ACh ligand.  AChRs therefore exhibit a sigmoidal dissociation curve due to this [[cooperative binding]] .<ref name="Sine" />  The presence of the inactive, intermediate receptor structure with a single-bound ligand keeps ACh in the synapse that might otherwise be lost by [[cholinesterase]] hydrolysis or diffusion.  The persistence of these ACh ligands in the synapse can cause a prolonged post-synaptic response.<ref name="Scuka">{{cite journal |author=Scuka M, Mozrzymas JW |title=Postsynaptic potentiation and desensitization at the vertebrate end-plate receptors |journal=Prog. Neurobiol. |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=19–33 |year=1992 |pmid=1736323 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0301-0082(92)90033-B}}</ref>

The pre and postsynaptic cells at the neuromuscular junction also contain [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptors]] that are [[metabotropic receptor]]s coupled with [[G-proteins]].  Muscarinic receptors can be found on the presynaptic cell, which act via negative feedback by binding acetylcholine molecules and inhibiting the release of more neurotransmitters through a signaling cascade.   G-protein subunits from this receptor can inactivate the calcium channels necessary for neurotransmitter release.  Muscarinic AChRs on the sarcolemma of the postsynaptic cell bind ACh, which activates a G-protein that opens Kir3.1 potassium channels, thereby hyperpolarizing the muscle fiber.<ref name="Text" />

==Development of the neuromuscular junction==
The development of the neuromuscular junction requires signaling from both the motor neuron's terminal and the muscle cell's central region. During development, muscle cells produce acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and express them in the central regions in a process called prepatterning. [[Agrin]], a heparin [[proteoglycan]], and MuSK kinase are thought to help stabilize the accumulation of AChR in the central regions of the myocyte. MuSK is a receptor [[tyrosine kinase]] — meaning that it induces cellular signaling by binding [[phosphate]] molecules to self regions like [[tyrosine]]s, and to other targets in the [[cytoplasm]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Valenzuela D, Stitt T, DiStefano P, Rojas E, Mattsson K, Compton D, Nuñez L, Park J, Stark J, Gies D | title = Receptor tyrosine sinase specific for the skeletal muscle lineage: expression in embryonic muscle, at the neuromuscular junction, and after injury | journal = Neuron | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 573–84 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7546737 | doi = 10.1016/0896-6273(95)90146-9}}</ref> Upon activation by its ligand agrin, MuSK signals via two proteins called "[[Dok-7]]" and "[[rapsyn]]", to induce "clustering" of acetylcholine receptors.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Glass D, Bowen D, Stitt T, Radziejewski C, Bruno J, Ryan T, Gies D, Shah S, Mattsson K, Burden S, DiStefano P, Valenzuela D, DeChiara T, Yancopoulos G | title = Agrin acts via a MuSK receptor complex | journal = Cell | volume = 85 | issue = 4 | pages = 513–23 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8653787 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81252-0}}</ref> ACh release by developing motor neurons produces postsynaptic potentials in the muscle cell that positively reinforces the localization and stabilization of the developing neuromuscular junction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Witzemann V |title=Development of the neuromuscular junction |journal=Cell Tissue Res. |volume=326 |issue=2 |pages=263–71 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=16819627 |doi=10.1007/s00441-006-0237-x }}</ref>

These findings were demonstrated in part by mouse "[[transgenic|knockout]]" studies.  In mice which are deficient for either agrin or MuSK, the neuromuscular junction does not form. Further, mice deficient in [[Dok-7]] did not form either acetylcholine receptor clusters or neuromuscular synapses.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Okada K, Inoue A, Okada M, Murata Y, Kakuta S, Jigami T, Kubo S, Shiraishi H, Eguchi K, Motomura M, Akiyama T, Iwakura Y, Higuchi O, Yamanashi Y | title = The muscle protein Dok-7 is essential for neuromuscular synaptogenesis | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5781 | pages = 1802–5 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16794080 | doi = 10.1126/science.1127142 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/312/5781/1802}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
{{see also|Excitation-contraction coupling}}

The neuromuscular junction is where a neuron activates a muscle to contract.  This is a step in the [[excitation-contraction coupling]] of [[vertebrate]] skeletal muscle.

#Upon the arrival of an [[action potential]] at the presynaptic neuron terminal, [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s open and Ca<sup>2+</sup> [[ions]] flow from the [[extracellular fluid]] into the presynaptic neuron's [[cytosol]].
#This influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> causes [[neurotransmitter]]-containing [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicles]] to dock and fuse to the presynaptic neuron's [[cell membrane]] through [[SNARE (protein)|SNARE]] proteins.
#Fusion of the vesicular membrane with the presynaptic cell membrane results in the emptying of the vesicle's contents (acetylcholine) into the [[synapse|synaptic cleft]], a process known as [[exocytosis]].
# Acetylcholine diffuses into the synaptic cleft and can bind to the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s on the motor end plate.
#These receptors are [[ligand-gated ion channel]]s, and when they bind acetylcholine, they open, allowing sodium ions to flow in and potassium ions to flow out of the muscle cell.
#Because of the differences in [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] gradients across the plasma membrane, more sodium moves in than potassium out, producing a local depolarization of the motor end plate known as an [[end-plate potential]] (EPP).
#This depolarization spreads across the surface of the muscle fiber and continues the [[excitation-contraction coupling]] to contract the muscle.
#The action of acetylcholine is terminated when ACh diffuses away from the synapse or the enzyme [[acetylcholinesterase]] degrades part of ACh (producing [[choline]] and an [[acetate]] group).
#The choline produced by the action of acetylcholinesterase is recycled &nbsp;— it is transported, through [[reuptake]], back into the presynaptic terminal where it is used to synthesize new acetylcholine molecules.<ref name="Purves" >{{cite book | author = Dale Purves, George J.

==Research methods==

Joel del Castillo and Bernard Katz used ionophoresis to determine the location and density of [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s (AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction.  With this technique, a microelectrode was placed inside the motor end-plate of the muscle fiber, and a micropipette filled with acetylcholine (ACh) is placed directly in front of the endplate in the synaptic cleft.  A positive voltage was applied to the tip of the micropipette, which caused a burst of positively charged ACh molecules to be released from the pipette. These ligands flowed into the space representing the synaptic cleft and bound to AChRs.  The intracellular microelectrode monitored the [[amplitude]] of the [[depolarization]] of the motor end plate in response to ACh binding to nicotinic (ionotropic) receptors.  Katz and del Castillo showed that the amplitude of the depolarization ([[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]) depended on the proximity of the micropipette releasing the ACh ions to the endplate.  The farther the micropipette was from the motor endplate, the smaller the depolarization was in the muscle fiber.  This allowed the researchers to determine that the nicotinic receptors were localized to the motor end-plate in high density.<ref name="Text" /><ref name="Sine" />

Toxins are also used to determine the location of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. [[alpha-bungarotoxin|α-Bungarotoxin]] is a toxin found in the snake species [[Bungarus multicinctus]] that acts as an ACh antagonist and binds to AChRs irreversibly.  By coupling assayable enzymes such as [[horseradish peroxidase]] (HRP) or fluorescent proteins such as [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) to the α-bungarotoxin, AChRs can be visualized and quantified.<ref name="Text" />

==Toxins==

===Botulinum toxin===
[[Botulinum toxin]], also known as Botox, inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by interfering with SNARE proteins.<ref name="Text" /> This toxin crosses into the nerve terminal through the process of [[endocytosis]] and subsequently interferes with SNARE proteins, which are necessary for ACh release. By doing so, it induces a transient paralysis and chemical denervation localized to the striated muscle that it has affected. The inhibition of the ACh release does not set in until approximately two weeks after the injection is made. Three months after the inhibition occurs, neuronal activity begins to regain partial function, and six months, complete neuronal function is regained.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Papapetropoulos S, Singer C |title=Botulinum toxin in movement disorders |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=183–94 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17390263 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-971171 |url=http://www.thieme-connect.com/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2007-971171}}</ref>

===Snake Venom===
Snake venoms act as toxins at the neuromuscular junction and can induce weakness and [[paralysis]]. Venoms can act as both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins.<ref name="Lewis">{{cite journal |author=Lewis RL, Gutmann L |title=Snake venoms and the neuromuscular junction |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=175–9 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15257514 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-830904 |url=http://www.thieme-connect.com/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2004-830904}}</ref>

Presynaptic neurotoxins, commonly known as β-neurotoxins, affect the presynaptic regions of the neuromuscular junction. The majority of these neurotoxins act by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, into the synapse between neurons. However, some of these toxins have also been known to enhance neurotransmitter release. Those that inhibit neurotransmitter release create a [[neuromuscular blockade]] that prevents signaling molecules from reaching their postsynaptic target receptors. In doing so, the victim of these snake bite suffer from profound weakness. Such neurotoxins do not respond well to anti-venoms. After one hour of inoculation of these toxins, including notexin and [[taipoxin]], many of the affected nerve terminals show signs of irreversible physical damage, leaving them devoid of any [[synaptic vesicle]]s.<ref name="Lewis" />

Postsynaptic neurotoxins, otherwise known as α-neurotoxins, act oppositely to the presynaptic neurotoxins by binding to the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. This prevents interaction between the acetylcholine released by the presynaptic terminal and the receptors on the postsynaptic cell. In effect, the opening of sodium channels associated with these acetylcholine receptors is prohibited, resulting in a neuromuscular blockade, similar to the effects seen due to presynaptic neurotoxins. This causes paralysis in the muscles involved in the affected junctions. Unlike presynaptic neurotoxins, postsynaptic toxins are more easily affected by anti-venoms, which accelerate the dissociation of the toxin from the receptors, ultimately causing a reversal of paralysis. These neurotoxins experimentally and qualitatively aid in the study of acetylcholine receptor [[density]] and [[Cell turnover|turnover]], as well as in studies observing the direction of [[antibodies]] toward the affected acetylcholine receptors in patients diagnosed with [[myasthenia gravis]].<ref name="Lewis" />

==Diseases==
Any [[Disease|disorder]] that compromises the synaptic transmission between a motor neuron and a muscle cell is categorized under the umbrella term of neuromuscular diseases. These disorders can be [[Heredity|inherited]] or [[acquired]] and can vary in their severity and mortality. In general, most of these disorders tend to be caused by mutations or autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders, in the case of neuromuscular diseases, tend to be [[humoral]] mediated, [[B cell]] mediated, and result in an [[antibody]] improperly created against a motor neuron or muscle fiber protein that interferes with synaptic transmission or signaling.

===Autoimmune===

====Myasthenia gravis====
[[Myasthenia gravis]] is an autoimmune disorder where the body makes antibodies against either the acetylcholine receptor (AchR) (in 80% of cases), or against postsynaptic muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) (0–10% of cases). In seronegative myasthenia gravis [[low density lipoprotein]] receptor-related protein 4 is targeted by [[IgG1]], which acts as a competitive inhibitor of its ligand, preventing the ligand from binding its receptor. It is not known if seronegative myasthenia gravis will respond to standard therapies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Finsterer J, Papi&#x107; L, Auer-Grumbach M |title=Motor neuron, nerve, and neuromuscular junction disease |journal=Curr. Opin. Neurol. |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=469–74 |year=2011 |month=October |pmid=21825986 |doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e32834a9448 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1350-7540&volume=24&issue=5&spage=469}}</ref>

=====Neonatal MG=====
Neonatal MG is an autoimmune disorder that affects 1 in 8 children born to mothers who have been diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis (MG). MG can be transferred from the mother to the fetus by the movement of AChR antibodies through the [[placenta]]. Signs of this disease at birth include weakness, which responds to anticholinesterase medications, as well as fetal akinesia, or the lack of fetal movement. This form of the disease is transient, lasting for about three months. However, in some cases, neonatal MG can lead to other health effects, such as arthrogryposis and even fetal death. These conditions are thought to be initiated when maternal AChR antibodies are directed to the [[fetal]] AChR and can last until the 33rd week of [[gestation]], when the γ subunit of AChR is replaced by the ε subunit.<ref name="Newsom">{{cite journal |author=Newsom-Davis J |title=The emerging diversity of neuromuscular junction disorders |journal=Acta Myol |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=5–10 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17915563 |pmc=2949330 }}</ref>

====Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome====
[[Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome]] (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction. This rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms: proximal muscle weakness, [[autonomic dysfunction]], and areflexia.<ref name="Luigetti">{{cite journal |author=Luigetti M, Modoni A, Lo Monaco M |title=Low rate repetitive nerve stimulation in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: Peculiar characteristics of decremental pattern from a single-centre experience |journal=Clin Neurophysiol |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2012 |month=October |pmid=23036181 |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2012.08.026 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1388-2457(12)00625-6}}</ref> Proximal muscle weakness is a product of [[pathogenic]] autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell. Examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by LEMS includes [[dry mouth]], which is most common, [[constipation]], and [[erectile dysfunction]] in men. Less common dysfunctions include [[dry eyes]] and altered [[perspiration]]. [[Areflexia]] is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise.<ref name="Titulaer">{{cite journal |author=Titulaer MJ, Lang B, Verschuuren JJ |title=Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: from clinical characteristics to therapeutic strategies |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=1098–107 |year=2011 |month=December |pmid=22094130 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70245-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474-4422(11)70245-9}}</ref>

50–60% of the patients that are diagnosed with LEMS also have present an associated [[tumor]], which is typically [[small-cell lung carcinoma]] (SCLC). This type of tumor also expresses [[voltage-gated calcium channels]].<ref name="Titulaer" /> Oftentimes, LEMS also occurs alongside myasthenia gravis.<ref name="Luigetti" />

Treatment for LEMS consists of using 3,4-diaminopyridine as a first measure, which serves to increase the compound muscle action potential as well as muscle strength by lengthening the time that voltage-gated calcium channels remain open after blocking voltage-gated potassium channels, or by targeting the β-subunit of VGCC directly. Further treatment includes the use of [[prednisone]] and [[azathioprine]] in the event that 3,4-diaminopyridine does not aid in treatment.<ref name="Titulaer" />

====Neuromyotonia====
[[Neuromyotonia]] (NMT), otherwise known as Isaac’s syndrome, is unlike many other diseases present at the neuromuscular junction. Rather than causing muscle weakness, NMT leads to the hyperexcitation of motor nerves. NMT causes this hyperexcitation by producing longer depolarizations by down-regulating [[voltage-gated potassium channel]]s, which causes greater neurotransmitter release and repetitive firing. This increase in rate of firing leads to more active transmission and as a result, greater muscular activity in the affected individual. NMT is also believed to be of [[autoimmune]] origin due to its associations with autoimmune symptoms in the individual affected.<ref name="Newsom" />

===Genetic===

====Congenital myasthenic syndromes====
[[Congenital myasthenic syndrome]]s (CMS) are very similar to both MG and LEMS in their functions, but the primary difference between CMS and those diseases is that CMS is of genetic origins. Specifically, these syndromes are diseases incurred due to mutations, typically [[recessive]], in 1 of at least 10 genes that affect presynaptic, synaptic, and postsynaptic proteins in the neuromuscular junction. Such mutations usually arise in the ε-subunit of AChR,<ref name="Newsom" /> thereby affecting the kinetics and expression of the receptor itself.  Single nucleotide substitutions or deletions may cause loss of function in the subunit. Other [[mutation]]s, such as those affecting [[acetylcholinesterase]] and [[acetyltransferase]], can also cause the expression of CMS, with the latter being associated specifically with episodic [[apnea]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harper CM |title=Congenital myasthenic syndromes |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=111–23 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15229798 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-829592 |url=http://www.thieme-connect.com/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2004-829592}}</ref> These syndromes can present themselves at different times within the life of an individual. They may arise during the fetal phase, causing fetal [[akinesia]], or the perinatal period, during which certain conditions, such as [[arthrogryposis]], [[:wikt:ptosis|ptosis]], [[hypotonia]], [[ophthalmoplegia]], and feeding or breathing difficulties, may be observed. They could also activate during adolescence or adult years, causing the individual to develop slow-channel syndrome.<ref name="Newsom" />

====Bulbospinal muscular atrophy====
[[Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy|Bulbospinal muscular atrophy]], also known as Kennedy’s disease, is a rare [[recessive]] trinucleotide, polyglutamine disorder that is linked to the [[X chromosome]]. Because of its linkage to the X chromosome, it is typically transmitted through females. However, Kennedy’s disease is only present in adult males and the onset of the disease is typically later in life. This disease is specifically caused by the expansion of a CAG-tandem repeat in exon 1 found on the androgen-receptor (AR) gene on [[chromosome]] Xq11-12. Poly-Q-expanded AR accumulates in the nuclei of cells, where it begins to fragment. After fragmentation, degradation of the cell begins, leading to a loss of both motor neurons and [[dorsal root ganglia]].<ref name="Finsterer">{{cite journal |author=Finsterer J |title=Perspectives of Kennedy's disease |journal=J. Neurol. Sci. |volume=298 |issue=1-2 |pages=1–10 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=20846673 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2010.08.025 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-510X(10)00392-8}}</ref>

Symptoms of Kennedy’s disease include weakness and wasting of the facial [[bulbar]] and extremity muscles, as well as sensory and endocrinological disturbances, such as [[gynecomastia]] and reduced [[fertility]]. Other symptoms include elevated [[testosterone]] and other sexual hormone levels, development of hyper-CK-emia, abnormal conduction through motor and sensory nerves, and [[neuropathic]] or in rare cases [[myopathic]] alterations on biopsies of muscle cells.<ref name="Finsterer" />

====Duchenne muscular dystrophy====
[[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] is an X-linked genetic disorder that results in the absence of the structural protein [[dystrophin]] at the neuromuscular junction.  It affects 1 in 3,600–6,000 males and frequently causes death by the age of 30.  The absence of dystrophin causes muscle [[degeneration]], and patients present with the following symptoms: abnormal [[gait]], [[hypertrophy]] in the calf muscles, and elevated [[creatine kinase]].  If left untreated, patients may suffer from [[respiratory distress]], which can lead to death.<ref name="Beytia">{{cite journal |author=Beytía Mde L, Vry J, Kirschner J |title=Drug treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: available evidence and perspectives |journal=Acta Myol |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=4–8 |year=2012 |month=May |pmid=22655510 |pmc=3440798 }}</ref>
