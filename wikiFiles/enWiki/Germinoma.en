A '''germinoma''' is a type of [[germ cell tumor]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000044295|Germinoma}}</ref>, which is not differentiated upon examination.<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2246.htm Germinoma, Central Nervous System] at [[eMedicine]]</ref> It may be [[benign]] or [[malignant]].

==Classification==
The term ''germinoma'' most often refers to a [[tumor]] in the [[brain tumor|brain]] that has a [[histology]] identical to two other tumors: '''dysgerminoma''' in the [[ovarian cancer|ovary]] and '''seminoma''' in the [[testicular cancer|testis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/path/gyn/ovary3.cfm |title=Pathology |accessdate=2007-11-03 |format= |work=}}</ref> Since 1994, [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] has defined germinoma as "a [[malignant]] [[neoplasm]] of the [[germ cell|germinal]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] of the [[gonad]]s; [[mediastinum]]; or [[pineal]] region"<ref>{{MeshName|Germinoma}}</ref> and within its scope included both dysgerminoma and seminoma. Collectively, these are the '''seminomatous''' or '''germinomatous''' tumors.

==Natural history==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}
Germinomas are thought to originate from an error of development, when certain primordial germ cells fail to migrate properly.<!-- this is true of all germ cell tumors, not only germinomas -->  Germinomas lack [[histology|histologic]] differentiation, whereas [[germ cell tumor|nongerminomatous germ cell tumors]] display a variety of differentiation.  Like other germ cell tumors, germinomas can undergo malignant transformation.

==Histology==
The tumor is uniform in appearance, consisting of large, round [[cell (biology)|cells]] with vesicular [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] and clear or finely granular [[cytoplasm]] that is [[eosinophilic]].

On gross examination, the external surface is smooth and bosselated (knobby), and the interior is soft, fleshy and either cream-coloured, gray, pink or tan. Microscopic examination typically reveals uniform cells that resemble primordial germ cells. Typically, the [[Thylakoid|stroma]] contains [[lymphocyte]]s and about 20% of patients have sarcoid-like [[granuloma]]s.

==Diagnosis==
[[Metastasis]] has been noted in approximately 22% of cases at time of diagnosis. Males are approximately twice as commonly affected in developing germinomas. Germinomas are most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 10 and 21.

Often serum and spinal fluid [[tumor marker]]s of [[alpha-fetoprotein|AFP]] and [[beta-HCG]] are tested. Pure germinomas are not associated with these markers. Nongerminomatous germ cell tumors may be associated with increased markers such as AFP with [[yolk sac tumor]]s as well as [[embryonal carcinoma|embryonic cell carcinomas]] and [[teratoma|immature teratomas]] and beta-HCG which occur in [[choriocarcinoma]]s. In 1-15% of germinonas a low level of beta-HCG may be produced. Although controversial, there are some thoughts that HCG-secreting germinomas are more aggressive than nonsecreting ones.

==Locations==
===Ovary (dysgerminoma) and testis (seminoma)===
[[Dysgerminoma]] is the most common type of [[malignant]] [[germ cell]] [[ovarian cancer]]. Dysgerminoma usually occurs in [[adolescence]] and early adult life; about 5% occur in pre-pubertal children. Dysgerminoma is extremely rare after age 50. Dysgerminoma occurs in both ovaries in 10% of patients and, in a further 10%, there is microscopic tumor in the other ovary.

[[Seminoma]] is the second most common [[testicular cancer]];  the most common is mixed, which may contain seminoma.

Abnormal [[gonad]]s (due to [[gonadal dysgenesis]] and [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]]) have a high risk of developing a dysgerminoma.<ref>Sadler, T.W. 2006. Langman's medical Embryology, 10th Edition, Chapter 15, pp. 251-252. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Pub.</ref> Most dysgerminomas are associated with elevated serum [[lactic dehydrogenase]] (LDH), which is sometimes used as a [[tumor marker]].

[[Metastases]] are most often present in the [[lymph node]]s.

===Intracranial germinoma===
Intracranial germinoma occurs in 0.7 per million children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Keene D |title=Epidemiological survey of central nervous system germ cell tumors in Canadian children |journal=J. Neurooncol. |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=289–95 |year=2007 |pmid=17120159 |doi=10.1007/s11060-006-9282-2 |author-separator=, |author2=Johnston D |author3=Strother D |display-authors=3 |last4=Fryer |first4=C. |last5=Carret |first5=A. S. |last6=Crooks |first6=B. |last7=Eisenstat |first7=D. |last8=Moghrabi |first8=A. |last9=Wilson |first9=B.}}</ref> As with other [[germ cell tumor]]s (GCTs) occurring outside the [[gonad]]s, the most common location of intracranial germinoma is on or near the midline, often in the [[pineal]] or [[suprasellar]] areas; in 5-10% of patients with germinoma in either area, the tumor is in both areas. Like other (GCTs), germinomas can occur in other parts of the brain. Within the [[brain]], this tumor is most common in the [[hypothalamic]] or [[hypophyseal]] regions. In the [[thalamus]] and [[basal ganglia]], germinoma is the most common GCT.

The diagnosis of an intracranial germinoma usually is based on [[biopsy]], as the features on neuroimaging appear similar to other tumors.

[[Cell biology|Cytology]] of the [[cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]] often is studied to detect [[metastasis]] into the [[Spinal cord|spine]]. This is important for staging and radiotherapy planning.

Intracranial germinomas have a reported 90% survival to five years after diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Packer RJ, Cohen BH, Cooney K, Coney K |title=Intracranial germ cell tumors |journal=Oncologist |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=312–20 |year=2000 |pmid=10964999 |doi= |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/content/full/5/4/312#R9}}</ref> Near total resection does not seem to influence the cure rate, so gross total resection is not necessary and can increase the risk of complications from surgery. The best results have been reported{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} from craniospinal radiation with local tumor boost of greater than 4,000 cGy.

==Treatment and prognosis==
Germinomas, like several other types of germ cell tumor, are sensitive to both [[chemotherapy]]<ref name="pmid17690837">{{cite journal |author=Ueba T |title=Long-term follow-up of 5 patients with intracranial germinoma initially treated by chemotherapy alone |journal=Acta neurochirurgica |volume=149 |issue=9 |pages=897–902; discussion 902 |year=2007 |pmid=17690837 |doi=10.1007/s00701-007-1268-0 |author-separator=, |author2=Yamashita K |author3=Fujisawa I |display-authors=3 |last4=Nakao |first4=S. |last5=Ooyama |first5=K. |last6=Yorihuji |first6=T. |last7=Kato |first7=S. F. |last8=Seto |first8=S. |last9=Kageyama |first9=N.}}</ref> and [[radiotherapy]]. For this reason, treatment with these methods can offer excellent chances of longterm survival, even cure.

Although chemotherapy can shrink germinomas, it is not generally recommended alone unless there are contraindications to radiation. In a study in the early 1990s, [[carboplatinum]], [[etoposide]] and [[bleomycin]] were given to 45 germinoma patients, and about half the patients relapsed. Most of these relapsed patients were then recovered with radiation or additional chemotherapy.<ref name="pmid8918487">{{cite journal |author=Balmaceda C |title=Chemotherapy without irradiation--a novel approach for newly diagnosed CNS germ cell tumors: results of an international cooperative trial.
