Symptoms, which include itchy, raised [[papules]], commonly occur within hours of infection and do not generally last more than a week. 

A number of different [[flatworm]] [[parasite]]s in the family [[Schistosomatidae]] are what cause swimmer’s itch. These parasites use both [[freshwater snail]]s and [[vertebrates]] as hosts in their [[parasitic life cycles]]. Mostly [[waterfowl]] are used as the vertebrate host. 
During one of their life stages, the larvae of the parasite, [[cercaria]], leave the water snails and swim freely in the freshwater, attempting to encounter [[water bird]]s. These larvae can accidentally come into contact with the skin of a swimmer. The cercaria penetrates the skin and dies in the skin immediately. The cercaria larvae cannot infect humans, but they cause an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] immune reaction. This reaction causes initially mildly [[itch]]y spots on the skin. Within hours, these spots become raised papules which are intensely itchy. Each papule corresponds to the penetration site of a single parasite. 

The schistosomatidae that give rise to swimmer’s itch should not to be confused with those of the genus ''[[Schistosoma]]'', which infect humans and cause the serious human [[disease]] [[schistosomiasis]], or with larval stages of [[thimble jellyfish]] (''[[Linuchidae|Linuche unguiculata]]''), which give rise to [[seabather's eruption]]. 
Seabather's eruption mostly occurs in salt water, on skin covered by clothing or hair, whereas swimmer's itch mostly occurs in freshwater, on uncovered skin.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 1017216 | year = 1976 | month = Oct | author = Osment, Ls | title = Update: seabather's eruption and swimmer's itch. | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 545–7 | issn = 0011-4162 | journal = Cutis; cutaneous medicine for the practitioner }}</ref>

Since it was first described in [[Michigan]] in 1928,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cort WW |title=Schistosome dermatitis in the United States (Michigan). |journal=JAMA |volume=90 |issue= |pages=1027–9 |year=1928  |doi= }}</ref> swimmer's itch has been reported from around the world.

== Cause ==
The schistosomatidae [[genus|genera]] most commonly associated with swimmer’s itch in humans are ''Trichobilharzia'' and ''Gigantobilharzia''. Trematodes in these groups normally complete their life cycles in water birds. However, swimmer’s itch can also be caused by schistosome parasites of non-avian vertebrates, such as ''Schistosomatium douthitti'', which infects snails and [[rodent]]s. Other [[taxon|taxa]] reported to cause the reaction include ''Bilharziella polonica'' and ''Schistosoma bovis''. In [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[habitat]]s, especially along the [[coast]]s, swimmer’s itch can occur as well.<ref name=Brant>{{cite journal |author=Brant S, Cohen A, James D, Hui L, Hom A, Loker E |title=Cercarial Dermatitis Transmitted by Exotic Marine Snail |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=1357–65 |year=2010 |pmid=20735918}}</ref> In [[Australia]], the so called "[[pelican itch]]" is caused by [[cercaria]]e of the genus ''[[Austrobilharzia]]'' employing marine [[Gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Batillaria]]'' (''B. australis'') as [[intermediate host]]s.

==Life cycles of non-human schistosomes==
The non-[[human]] schistosomes use two hosts in their life cycles. One is an aquatic snail, the other is a bird or mammal. 

* Schistosomes are [[gonochoristic]] and sexual reproduction takes place in the vertebrate host. In genera that infect birds, adult worms occur in tissues and veins of the host’s [[gastrointestinal tract]], where they produce eggs that are shed into water with host [[feces]].
 
Note: One European species, ''[[Trichobilharzia regenti]]'', instead infects the bird host’s [[Nose|nasal]] [[Biological tissue|tissues]] and larvae hatch from the eggs directly in the tissue during drinking/feeding of the infected birds.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Horák P, Kolárová L, Dvorák J |title=Trichobilharzia regenti n. sp. (Schistosomatidae, Bilharziellinae), a new nasal schistosome from Europe |journal=Parasite |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=349–57 |year=1998 |month=December |pmid=9879557 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

* Once a schistosome egg is immersed in [[water]], a short-lived, non-feeding, free-living stage known as the [[miracidium]] emerges. The miracidium uses [[cilium|cilia]] to follow chemical and physical cues thought to increase its chances of finding the first intermediate host in its life cycle, an [[aquatic snail]].

* After infecting a snail, it develops into a mother [[Apicomplexa lifecycle stages|sporocyst]], which in turn undergoes [[asexual reproduction]], yielding large numbers of daughter sporocysts, which asexually produce another short-lived, free-living stage, the [[cercaria]].

* Cercariae use a tail-like appendage (often forked in [[genus|genera]] causing swimmer’s itch) to swim to the surface of the water; and use various physical and chemical cues; in order to locate the next and final (definitive) host in the life cycle, a bird.

* After infecting a bird, the parasite develops into a [[schistosomulum]] and migrates through the host’s circulatory system (or nervous system in case of ''T. regenti'') to the final location within the host body where it matures and, if it encounters a mate, sheds eggs to begin the cycle anew.

==Risk factors==
Humans usually become infected with avian schistosomes after swimming in [[lakes]] or other bodies of slow-moving fresh water. Some laboratory evidence indicates snails shed cercariae most intensely in the morning and on sunny days, and exposure to water in these conditions may therefore increase risk. Duration of swimming is positively correlated with increased risk of infection in Europe<ref name=Chamot>{{cite journal |author=Chamot E, Toscani L, Rougemont A |title=Public health importance and risk factors for cercarial dermatitis associated with swimming in Lake Leman at Geneva, Switzerland |journal=Epidemiol. Infect. |volume=120 |issue=3 |pages=305–14 |year=1998 |pmid=9692609 |doi= 10.1017/S0950268898008826|url= |pmc=2809408}}</ref> and North America,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lindblade KA |title=The epidemiology of cercarial dermatitis and its association with limnological characteristics of a northern Michigan lake |journal=J.

Parasitol. |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=697–704 |year=2004 |pmid=15357056 |doi= 10.1645/GE-237R|url=}}</ref> Stimuli for cercarial penetration into host [[skin]] include [[saturated fat|unsaturated]] [[fatty acids]], such as [[Linoleic acid|linoleic]] and [[α-Linolenic acid|linolenic]] acids. These substances occur naturally in human skin and are found in [[sun lotion]]s and creams based on [[plant oils]].

==Control measures and treatment==
Various strategies, targeting either the [[mollusc]] or [[bird|avian]] hosts of schistosomes, have been used by lakeside residents in recreational areas of North America to deal with outbreaks of swimmer's itch. In [[Michigan]], for decades authorities used [[copper sulfate]] as a molluscicide to reduce snail host populations and thereby the incidence of swimmer's itch. The results with this agent have been inconclusive, possibly because: 
* snails become tolerant
* local water chemistry reduces the molluscicide's efficacy
* local currents diffuse it
* adjacent snail populations repopulate a treated area.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blankespoor HD, Reimink RL|title=The control of swimmer's itch in Michigan: Past, present, and future |journal=Michigan Academician |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=7–23 |year=1991 }}</ref>

More importantly, perhaps, copper sulfate is toxic to more than just molluscs, and the effects of its use on [[aquatic ecosystem]]s are not well understood.

Another method targeting the snail host, mechanical disturbance of snail habitat, has been also tried in some areas of North America<ref name=leighton/> and [[Lake Annecy]] in France, with promising results. <br />Some work in Michigan suggests that administering [[praziquantel]] to hatchling waterfowl can reduce local swimmer's itch rates in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blankespoor CL, Reimink RL, Blankespoort HD |title=Efficacy of praziquantel in treating natural schistosome infections in [[common merganser]]s |journal=J. Parasitol. |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=424–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11318576 |doi= 10.1645/0022-3395(2001)087[0424:EOPITN]2.0.CO;2|url=}}</ref> Work on schistosomiasis showed that water-resistant topical applications of the common insect repellent [[DEET]] prevented schistosomes from penetrating the skin of mice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Salafsky B, Ramaswamy K, He YX, Li J, Shibuya T |title=Development and evaluation of LIPODEET, a new long-acting formulation of N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) for the prevention of schistosomiasis |journal=Am.

</ref> Also 0.1-1% [[niclosamide]] formulation in water resistant sun cream or [[Safe Sea]]<sup>TM</sup> cream protecting against [[jelly fish]] stings were shown to be highly reliable protectants, having lethal effect on schistosome cercariae.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wulff C, Haeberlein S, Haas W |title=Cream formulations protecting against cercarial dermatitis by Trichobilharzia |journal=Parasitol. Res. |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=91–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17252275 |doi=10.1007/s00436-006-0431-5 |url=}}</ref>
Public education of risk factors, a good alternative to the above-mentioned interventionist strategies, can also reduce human exposure to cercariae. Experience at [[Higgins Lake]], Michigan, where systematic research on Swimmer's Itch was conducted in the 1990s, shows that periodic brisk toweling of the lower extremities is effective in preventing Swimmer's Itch.

Orally administered [[hydroxyzine]], an [[antihistamine]], is sometimes prescribed to treat swimmer's itch and similar dermal allergic reactions.

==Other names==
Swimmer's itch has various other names. In [[Eastern world|eastern]] nations, it is often named in reference to the [[rice paddy|rice paddies]] where it is contracted, producing names which translate to "rice paddy itch". For example, in [[Japan]] it is called "kubure" or "kobanyo", in [[Malaysia]], "sawah", and in [[Thailand]], "hoi con".<!--Cite this: http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_diseases/swimmers_itch.html-->

In the [[United States]] it is known to some as "duckworms" (in coastal [[New Jersey]]) or duck lice, and "clam digger's itch".<!--Cite this: http://dermnetnz.org/arthropods/swimmers-itch.html-->

In certain parts of [[Canada]], mainly [[Ontario]], it is known as "Duck Lice" and "Beaver Lice".

In Australia it is known as "pelican itch".

In Western Minnesota, particularly on Lake Minnewaska, it is known as "lake itch".

Similarly in Brazil, the [[waterbody|waterbodies]] in which it is contracted are called ''lagoas da coceira'' ("lagoons of the itch"). All medical conditions caused by blood-flukes including swimmer's itch, nevertheless, are called either by the formal ones ''esquistossomose'' or ''bilharzíase'', or by the colloquial ''barriga d'água'' ("belly [full, composed] of water"). This is not completely due to ignorance, but also by the fact that the only ''Schistosoma'' species significantly occurring in Brazil (''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]'') is among the responsibles for human [[schistosomiasis]], so one has to avoid any ''lagoa de coceira'' or swimmer's itch with the intent of not getting the disease.
