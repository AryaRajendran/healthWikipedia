A '''substance-related disorder''' is a condition (such as intoxication, harmful use/abuse, dependence, withdrawal, and psychoses or amnesia associated with the use of the substance) associated with [[substance abuse]], often involving maladaptive behaviors over a long period of time.<ref name="Substance Abuse in Adults">{{cite web |url= http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/8347349501438555980.pdf |title= Substance abuse in adults |publisher= Unknown |format= PDF |author= Unknown |accessdate= 2011-07-12 }}</ref> In order to be diagnosed with substance dependence an individual must display at least three of the following for a 12 month period: "development of tolerance to the substance, withdrawal symptoms, persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to stop using the substance, ingestion of larger amounts of substance, declined life functioning, and persistent use of substance." <ref name="Substance Abuse in Adults" /> Substance abuse has been found to be most common among people 18 to 25 years of age and is also more common in males than females and in urban residents compared to those who live in rural areas.<ref name="Substance Abuse in Adults" /> Over 50 percent of individuals with substance abuse issues have been found to have another psychiatric disorder, something that is termed Comorbid Psychiatric Diagnosis.<ref name="Substance Abuse in Adults" /> Substance abuse is not the same in every person; it can differ in terms of the substance abused, the pattern of use and also the type of comorbid illness present, if any.<ref name="Substance Abuse in Adults" />

Substance-related disorders can be subcategorized into "substance use disorders" (SUD) and "substance-induced disorders" (SID).<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100010056|substance-related disorders}}</ref><ref name="GalanterKleber2008">{{cite book|author1=Marc Galanter|author2=Herbert D.

Though [[DSM-IV]] makes a firm distinction between the two, SIDs often occur in the context of SUDs.<ref name="FirstFrances2004">{{cite book|author1=Michael B.

Some people can have strong drug cravings even after they have not used the drug for a long period of time. They call this being "clean". To figure out how the brain triggers these cravings they have done multiple test on mice.<ref>{{cite news|last=Aldhous|first=Peter|title='Drug binge' mice reveal why cravings linger|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13630-drug-binge-mice-reveal-why-cravings-linger.html|accessdate=10/82011|newspaper=Newscientist|date=4/9/2008}}</ref>

Substance-related disorders, including both substance dependence and substance abuse, can lead to large societal problems. It is found to be greatest in individuals ages 18–25, with a higher likelihood occurring in men compared to women, and urban residents compared to rural residents. On average, general medical facilities hold 20% of patients with substance-related disorders, possibly leading to psychiatric disorders later on. Over 50% of individuals with substance-related disorders will often have a "dual diagnosis," where they are diagnosed with the substance abuse, as well as a psychiatric diagnosis, the most common being major depression, personality disorder, anxiety disorders, and dysthymia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leikin|first=J.B.|title=Substance-Related Disorders in Adults|journal=Disease-a-month|year=2007|volume=53|issue=6|pages=313–335|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>
