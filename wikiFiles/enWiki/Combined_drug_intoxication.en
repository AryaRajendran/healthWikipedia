'''Combined drug intoxication''' ('''CDI'''), also known as '''multiple drug intake''' ('''MDI''') or '''lethal [[polydrug]]/[[polypharmacy]] intoxication''', is an [[Unnatural death|unnatural]] cause of [[human]] [[death]]. It is distinct in that it is due to the simultaneous use of multiple [[drug]]s, whether the drugs are [[Prescription drug|prescription]], [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]], [[Recreational drug|recreational]], or some other combination.  The reasons for [[toxicity]] vary depending on the mixture of drugs.<ref>[http://www.americanoutreach.org/combined-drug-intoxication.htm "Combined Drug Intoxication"]. American Outreach. (2010-3-22).</ref>

CDI can occur with numerous drug combinations, including mixtures of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, legally or illegally obtained prescription drugs, [[herbal]] mixtures, and [[home remedy|home remedies]]. Ingestion of [[alcoholic beverage]]s, in combination with other drugs, increases the risk of CDI.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The CDI/MDI phenomenon seems to be becoming more common in recent years. In December 2007, according to Dr. [[John Mendelson]], a [[pharmacology|pharmacologist]] at the [[California Pacific Medical Center|California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute]], deaths by combined drug intoxication were relatively "rare" ("one in several million"), though they appeared then to be "on the rise".<ref name=Montgomery>{{cite web|author=James Montgomery|title=Hawthorne Heights Guitarist Casey Calvert's Fatal Drug Interaction Was Rare, Experts Say: Number of Accidental-Interaction Deaths Still Remains Relatively Low, Although Such Incidents Are on the Rise|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1577017/20071220/hawthorne_heights.jhtml|work=[[MTV]].com|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=2007-06-21|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> In July 2008, the [[Associated Press]] and [[CNN]] reported on a medical study showing that over two decades, from 1983 to 2004, such deaths have soared.<ref name=CNN>{{cite news|title=Home deaths from Drug Errors Soar |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/07/28/fatal.drug.errors.ap/|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=''cnn.com'' ([[Associated Press]])|date=2008-07-28|accessdate=2008-08-04|quote=Deaths from medication mistakes at home, such as actor [[Heath Ledger]]'s accidental overdose, rose dramatically during the past two decades, an analysis of U.S. death certificates finds. ... Prescription drug abuse plays a role in the rise in fatalities, but it's unclear how much, researchers said. ... The authors blame soaring home use of prescription painkillers and other potent drugs, which 25 years ago were given mainly inside hospitals. ... 'The amount of medical supervision is going down and the amount of responsibility put on the patient's shoulders is going up,' said lead author David P. Phillips of the [[University of California, San Diego]]. ... The findings, based on nearly 50 million U.S. death certificates, are published in Monday's Archives of Internal Medicine. Of those, more than 224,000 involved fatal medication errors, including overdoses and mixing prescription drugs with alcohol or street drugs. ... Deaths from medication mistakes at home increased from 1,132 deaths in 1983 to 12,426 in 2004. Adjusted for population growth, that amounts to an increase of more than 700 percent during that time.}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>  It has also become a prevalent risk for older patients.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite news|title=Mixing Drugs Puts More Older Patients at Risk|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-12-23-mixing-drugs_N.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=[[Gannett Corporation]]|date=2008-12-23|accessdate=2008-12-24 | first=Rita | last=Rubin}}</ref>

== Risk factors ==
People who engage in [[polypharmacy]] and other [[hypochondriac]] behaviors are at an elevated risk of death from CDI. Elderly people are at the highest risk of CDI, due to having many age-related health problems requiring many medications combined with age-impaired judgment, leading to confusion in taking medications.<ref name=CNN/><ref name=Rubin/> 

Recent veterans back from war and suffering from [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD) in combat are at risk of dying from CDI/MDI.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Nine Veteran PTSD patients died from CDI/MDI in America in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} There are anecdotal reports of veterans dying from combinations of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and tranquilizers used in combination with OTC medicines like [[diphenhydramine]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} While still a U.S. senator from Illinois, [[United States]] [[President]] [[Barack Obama]] asked the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] to inquire about the safety of these drugs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} There is an ongoing investigation of the matter.<ref name=WT>{{cite news|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2008/nov/13/veterans-kin-demands-answers-on-ptsd-drugs/|title=Dead Veteran's Kin Demand Inquiry: After Death of Son, Dad Takes Cases to Capitol Hill|author=Andrea Billups and Audrey Hudson|work=[[The Washington Times]]|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=[[Unification Church]] via [[News World Communications]]|date=2008-11-13|accessdate=2008-12-24}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
In general, the simultaneous use of multiple drugs should be carefully monitored by a qualified individual such as [[board certified]] and [[licensed]] [[Physician|medical doctor]], either an [[allopathic|M.D.]] or [[Osteopathic medicine|D.O.]]. Close association between prescribing physicians and pharmacies, along with the [[computerization]] of [[Medical prescription|prescription]]s and patients' medical histories, aim to avoid the occurrence of dangerous drug interactions. Lists of contraindications for a drug are usually provided with it, either in monographs, package inserts (accompanying prescribed medications), or in warning labels (for over-the-counter (OTC) drugs). CDI/MDI might also be avoided by physicians requiring their patients to return any unused prescriptions. Patients should ask their doctors and pharmacists if there are any interactions between the drugs they are taking.

==Paracetamol deaths{{anchor|Paracetamol / Acetaminophen deaths}}==
On June 30, 2009 an FDA advisory panel recommended that [[Vicodin]] and another painkiller, [[Percocet]], be removed from the market because they have allegedly caused over 400 deaths a year. The problem is with [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) overdose and liver damage. These two drugs, in combination with other drugs like [[Nyquil]] and [[Theraflu]], can cause death by multiple drug intake and/or [[drug overdose]]. Another solution would be to not include paracetamol with [[Vicodin]] or [[Percocet]].

=== Speedball deaths ===
Some controversially think speedball deaths are MDI/CDI when they might simply be [[drug overdose]], which is a related but, different phenomenon. The following list is for [[speedball (drug)|speedball]] CDI/MDI deaths only. Victims must be using cocaine and heroin in combination or amphetamine with demerol. An upper and a downer combination can be called speedball death.

* [[Layne Staley]] of [[Alice in Chains]] from [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]].
* Baseball athlete [[Ken Caminiti]] from [[cocaine]] and [[opioid]] painkillers;
* Actor [[Trevor Goddard]] from [[cocaine]], [[heroin]] and [[temazepam]];
* Actor/comedian [[John Belushi]] from [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]] '[[speedball (drug)|speedball]]'
* Stand up comedian [[Mitch Hedberg]], also from '[[speedball (drug)|speedball]]';
* Actor [[River Phoenix]] from [[heroin]], [[cocaine]] and [[methamphetamine]];
* [[Elisa Bridges]] from [[heroin]], [[methamphetamine]], [[pethidine]] and [[alprazolam]];

* [[John Kahn]], a Jerry Garcia collaborator and member of the [[Jerry Garcia Band]], from [[heroin]], [[cocaine]] and [[fluoxetine]];
* Singer [[Janis Joplin]] from [[heroin]] and alcohol. The Heroin was not properly mixed for use and was too potent.
* Actor/comedian [[Chris Farley]] from [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]] '[[speedball (drug)|speedball]]'

== CDI-related legal cases ==
=== Karen Ann Quinlan ===
{{Main|Karen Ann Quinlan}}
The [[Right to Die]] case of then-comatose [[Karen Ann Quinlan]] (March 29, 1954 - June 11, 1985) made legal history in 1975 and 1976, stimulating public scrutiny of ethical and moral implications of her case. In 1975, after drinking [[gin and tonic]]s at a party and then taking [[Diazepam]], Quinlan collapsed, suffered [[respiratory failure]] and [[irreversible brain damage]], and, after being taken to the hospital, lapsed into a [[persistent vegetative state]]. After she had been kept alive on a [[ventilator]] for several months without improvement, her parents requested that the hospital discontinue such active care and allow her to die. The hospital refused, and the subsequent legal battles made newspaper headlines and set significant precedents. After the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] ruled in her parents' favor, Quinlan spent nine more years comatose in the hospital, before dying from [[pneumonia]] in 1985.

== Michael Jackson ==

The CDI/MDI death of Michael Jackson led to the [[Trial of Conrad Murray]] to which he was sentenced to four years in California prison.
