Factors increasing the risk (to either the woman, the fetus/es, or both) of [[pregnancy]] beyond the normal level of risk may be present in a woman's medical profile either before she becomes pregnant or during the pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Health problems in pregnancy|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/healthproblemsinpregnancy.html|work=Medline Plus|publisher=US National Library of Medicine}}</ref> These pre-existing factors may relate to physical and/or mental health, and/or to social issues, or a combination. <ref group="MMHE">{{cite web|last=Merck|title=Risk factors present before pregnancy|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_at_high-risk/risk_factors_present_before_pregnancy.html|work=Merck Manual Home Health Handbook|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme}}</ref>

==Common risk factors==

Some common factors include:
*'''Age''' of either parent
**Adolescent parents {{Further|Teenage_pregnancy#Medical_outcomes}}
**Older parents {{Further|Paternal age|Maternal age effect|Pregnancy over age 50}}
*'''Teratogens''' {{main|Teratology}}
**Drug use or addiction
***Alcohol [[Fetal alcohol syndrome]], [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]]
***Tobacco [[Smoking and pregnancy]]
***See also [[Prenatal cocaine exposure]], [[Prenatal methamphetamine exposure]], [[Long-term effects of cannabis#Pregnancy]]
**[[Medication]](s).<ref group="MMHE">{{cite web|last=Merck|title=Merck Manual Home Health Handbook|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/drug_use_during_pregnancy/drug_use_during_pregnancy.html|work=Drug use during pregnancy|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme}}</ref> [[Anti-depressants]], for example, may increase risks of such outcomes as [[preterm delivery]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gavin |first1=AR |last2=Holzman |first2=C |last3=Siefert |first3=K |last4=Tian |first4=Y |title=MATERNAL DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, DEPRESSION AND PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION USE IN RELATION TO RISK OF PRETERM DELIVERY |journal=Women's Health Issues |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=325–34 |year=2009 |pmid=19733802 |pmc=2839867 |doi=10.1016/j.whi.2009.05.004}}</ref> {{Further|Pregnancy category}}

*'''Risks arising from previous pregnancies''':
**Complications experienced during a previous pregnancy are more likely to recur.
**[[Multiple_birth#Risks|Many previous pregnancies]]. Women who have had five previous pregnancies face increased risks of very rapid labor and excessive bleeding after delivery.
**Multiple previous fetuses. Women who have had more than one fetus in a previous pregnancy face increased risk of [[placenta previa|mislocated placenta]].<ref group="MMHE">{{cite web|last=Merck|title=Risk factors present before pregnancy|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_at_high-risk/risk_factors_present_before_pregnancy.html|work=Merck Manual Home Health Handbook|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme}}</ref> {{Further|multiple births}}

*'''Social and [[socioeconomic]] factors'''. Generally speaking, unmarried women and those in lower socioeconomic groups experience an increased level of risk in pregnancy, due at least in part to lack of access to appropriate [[prenatal care]].<ref group="MMHE">{{cite web|last=Merck|title=Risk factors present before pregnancy|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_at_high-risk/risk_factors_present_before_pregnancy.html|work=Merck Manual Home Health Handbook|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme}}</ref>
*[[Unintended pregnancy]].  Unintended pregnancies preclude preconception care and delays prenatal care.  They preclude other preventive care, may disrupt life plans and on average have worse health and psychological outcomes for the mother and, if birth occurs, the child.<ref name=BestIntent >{{cite book |author=Eisenberg, Leon; Brown, Sarah Hart |title=The best intentions: unintended pregnancy and the well-being of children and families |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=1995 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=4903 |pages= |isbn=0-309-05230-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref><ref name=HP2020FP>{{cite web | title = Family Planning - Healthy People 2020 | url = http://healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=13 | accessdate = 2011-08-18}}</ref>
*'''[[Human height|Height]]'''. Pregnancy in women whose height is less than 1.5 meters (5&nbsp;feet) correlates with higher incidences of [[preterm birth]] and [[Small for gestational age|underweight babies]]. Also, these women are more likely to have a small [[human pelvis|pelvis]], which can result in such complications during childbirth as [[shoulder dystocia]].<ref group="MMHE">{{cite web|last=Merck|title=Risk factors present before pregnancy|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_at_high-risk/risk_factors_present_before_pregnancy.html|work=Merck Manual Home Health Handbook|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme}}</ref>
*'''[[Human weight|Weight]]'''
**Low weight: Women whose pre-pregnancy weight is less than 45.5 kilograms (100 pounds) are more likely to have [[Small for gestational age|underweight babies]].
**[[Obesity|Obese]] women are more likely to have [[Large for gestational age|very large babies]], potentially increasing difficulties in [[childbirth]]. Obesity also increases the chances of developing [[gestational diabetes]], [[high blood pressure]], [[preeclampsia]], experiencing [[postterm pregnancy]] and/or requiring a [[cesarean]] delivery.<ref group="MMHE">{{cite web|last=Merck|title=Risk factors present before pregnancy|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_at_high-risk/risk_factors_present_before_pregnancy.html|work=Merck Manual Home Health Handbook|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme}}</ref>

==Disorders and diseases==

Pre-existing disorders and/or congenital defects can increase the usual risks involved in pregnancy. In such circumstances, women who wish to continue with a pregnancy require extra medical care, often from an interdisciplinary team. Such a team might include (besides an obstetrician) a specialist in the disorder and other practitioners (for example, maternal-fetal specialists, [[nutritionist]]s, etc.).<ref group="MMHE">{{cite web|last=Merck|title=Overview of Disease During Pregnancy|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_complicated_by_disease/overview_of_disease_during_pregnancy.html|work=Merck Manual Home Health Handbook|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme}}</ref>

===High-risk pregnancy===

Some disorders and conditions can mean that pregnancy is considered high-risk (about 6-8% of pregnancies in the USA) and in extreme cases may be [[contraindicated]]. High-risk pregnancies are the main focus of doctors specialising in [[maternal-fetal medicine]].

Serious pre-existing disorders which can reduce a woman's physical ability to survive pregnancy include a range of [[congenital defect]]s (that is, conditions with which the woman herself was born, for example, those of the [[heart defect|heart]] or [[ICD-10_Chapter_XVII:_Congenital_malformations,_deformations_and_chromosomal_abnormalities#.28Q50–Q56.29_genital_organs|reproductive organs]], some of which are listed above) and diseases acquired at any time during the woman's life.

===Low-risk pregnancy===
A Dutch 2010 research showed that "low-risk" pregnancy in the Netherlands may actually carry a higher risk of perinatal death than a "high-risk" pregnancy.<ref>{{Cite journal
