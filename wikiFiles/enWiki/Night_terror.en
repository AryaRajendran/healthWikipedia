A '''night terror''', '''sleep terror''' or '''''pavor nocturnus''''' is a [[parasomnia]] [[sleep disorder|disorder]], causing feelings of terror or dread, and typically occurring in the first few hours of [[sleep]] during stage 3 or 4 [[non-rapid eye movement]] (NREM) sleep.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hockenbury|first=Don H.

Night terrors have been known since the ancient times, although it was impossible to differentiate from [[nightmares]] until rapid eye movement was discovered.<ref name="Szelenberger" />  While nightmares (bad dreams that cause feelings of horror or fear) are relatively common during childhood, night terrors occur less frequently according to the ''[[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]]''.<ref name=AACAP>{{cite web|last=American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|title=Facts for Families No. 34: Children's Sleep Problems|url=http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/childrens_sleep_problems|publisher=AACAP|accessdate=Dec. 20, 2011}}</ref> An estimated 1%-6% of children and fewer than 1% of adults will experience a night terror episode within their lifetime.<ref name="AmericanPsychiatric">American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text revision). Washington, DC: Author.</ref> Night terrors can often be mistaken for the disorder of [[confusional arousal]].<ref name="Bjorvatn" /> Sleep terrors begin between ages 3 and 12 years and then usually dissipate during adolescence. In adults they most commonly occur between the ages of 20 to 30. Though the frequency and severity vary between individuals, the episodes can occur in intervals of days or weeks, but can also occur over consecutive nights or multiple times in one night.<ref name=DSM /><ref name="Guzman" />

Night terrors are largely unknown to most people, creating the notion that any type of nocturnal attack or nightmare can be confused with and reported as a night terror.<ref name="Szelenberger" />

==Associated features==
The universal feature of night terrors is inconsolability.<ref name="Nguyen">{{cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=B.|coauthors=Pérusse, D., Paquet, J., Petit, D., Boivin, M., Tremblay, R. E., & Montplaisir, J.|title=Sleep terrors in children: A prospective study of twins|journal=Pediatrics|year=2008|volume=122|issue=6|pages=e1164–e1167|pmid=19047218|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-1303}}</ref> During night terror bouts, patients are usually described as 'bolting upright' with their eyes wide open and a look of fear and panic on their face. They will often scream. Further, they will usually sweat, exhibit rapid respiration, and have a rapid heart rate (''autonomic signs''). In some cases, individuals are likely to have even more elaborate motor activity, such as a thrashing of limbs—which may include punching, swinging, or fleeing motions. There is a sense that the individual is trying to protect themselves and/or escape from a possible threat which can lead to physical injury of the individual.<ref name=DSM />   Although it seems like children are awake during a night terror, they will appear confused, be inconsolable and/or unresponsive to attempts to communicate with them, and may not recognize others familiar to them. Occasionally, when a person with a night terror is awoken, they will lash out at the person which can be dangerous for that individual.<ref name="Guzman" /> Most people who experience this disorder are amnesic, or partially amnesic from the incident the next day.<ref name="Bjorvatn" />  Sleepwalking is another predisposition for the disorder.<ref name="Szelenberger" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Oudiette|first=D.|coauthors=Leu, S., Pottier, M., Buzare, M., Brion, A., & Arnulf, I|title=Dreamlike mentations during sleepwalking and sleep terrors in adults|journal=Sleep: Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders|year=2009|volume=32|issue=12|pages=1621–1627}}</ref> Sleepwalking and night terrors are different manifestations of the same parasomnia disorder.<ref name="Szelenberger" />

During lab tests, subjects are known to have very high voltages of [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) delta activity, an increase in muscle tone, and a doubled increase in heart rate, if not more. Brain activities during a typical episode show theta and alpha activity when using an EEG. It is also common to see abrupt arousal from NREM sleep that does not progress into a full episode of a night terror. These episodes can include [[tachycardia]]. Night terrors are also associated with intense autonomic discharge of [[tachypnea]], flushing, [[diaphoresis]], and [[mydriasis]].<ref name="Nguyen" />

There is a close association with [[psychopathology]] or [[mental disorders]] in adults that suffer from sleep terror disorder. There may be an increased occurrence of sleep terror disorder particularly with those that have suffered from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] or PTSD and [[generalized anxiety disorder]]. Night terrors are closely linked to [[sleepwalking]] and [[frontal lobe epilepsy]].<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/914360-overview</ref> It is also likely that some [[personality disorder]]s may occur in individuals with sleep terror disorder, such as dependent, schizoid, and borderline personality disorders. There have been some symptoms of depression and anxiety that have increased in individuals that have suffered from frequent night terrors. [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood sugar]] is associated with both pediatric and adult night terrors.<ref name=DSM /><ref>Blog from Fountia, “Things You Didn’t Know About Night Terrors”</ref> Night terrors may cause children 12 and older to see paranormal substance, feel mentally and physically ill, and/or commit suicide.{{cn|date=March 2013}} A study of adults with thalamic lesions of the brain and brainstem have been occasionally associated with night terrors.<ref name=genaro>{{cite journal|last=Di Gennaro|first=G.|coauthors=Autret, A., Mascia, A., Onorati, P., Sebastiano, F., & Quarato, P|title=Night terrors associated with thalamic lesion|journal=Clinical Neuropsychology|year=2004|volume=115|issue=11|pages=2489–2492|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2004.05.029}}</ref>

==Genetic and cultural features==
There is some evidence that a predisposition to night terrors and other parasomnia disorders can be [[congenital]]. Individuals frequently report that past family members have had either episodes of sleep terrors or sleepwalking. In some studies, a 10-fold increase in the prevalence of the disorder in first-degree [[biological]] relatives has been observed—however, the exact link to [[inheritance]] is not known.<ref name=DSM /> [[Familial aggregation]] has been found suggesting that there is an [[autosomal]] mode of inheritance.<ref name="Nguyen 2008 e1164-e1167">{{cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=B.|coauthors=Pérusse, D., Paquet, J., Petit, D., Boivin, M., Tremblay, R. E., & Montplaisir, J.|title=Sleep terrors in children: A prospective study of twins|journal=Pediatrics|year=2008|volume=122|issue=6|pages=e1164–e1167|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-1303|pmid=19047218}}</ref> In addition, some [[laboratory]] findings suggest that sleep deprivation and having a [[fever]] can increase the likelihood of a night terror episode occurring.<ref name="AmericanPsychiatric"/> Other contributing factors include nocturnal [[asthma]], gastroesophageal reflux, and [[central nervous system]] [[medications]].<ref name="Nguyen 2008 e1164-e1167"/>  Special consideration must be used when the subject suffers from [[narcolepsy]], as there may be a link between the disorders. There have been no findings that show a cultural difference between manifestations of [[Sleep Terror Disorder]], though it is thought that the significance and cause of sleep terrors differ within [[culture]]s.

Also, older children and adults provide highly detailed and descriptive images associated with their sleep terrors than younger children, who either cannot recall or only vaguely remember.  Sleep terrors in children are also more likely to occur in males than females; in adults, the ratio between sexes are the same.<ref name=DSM /> A longitudinal study of twins, both monozygotic and dizygotic were examined and found to show that a high concordance rate of night terror was found much more in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic.<ref name="Nguyen 2008 e1164-e1167"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Poblano|first=A.|coauthors=Poblano-Alcalá, A., & Haro, R.|title=Sleep-terror in a child evolving into sleepwalking in adolescence. Case report with the patient's point of view|journal=Revista Brasileira De Psiquiatria|year=2010|volume=32|issue=3|pages=321–322|doi=10.1590/S1516-44462010000300022|pmid=20945027}}</ref>  

Though the symptoms of night terrors in adolescents and adults are similar, the ''[[etiology]]'', ''[[prognosis]]'', and ''treatment'' are qualitatively different. There is some evidence that suggests that night terrors can occur if the sufferer does not eat a proper diet, does not get the appropriate amount or quality of sleep (e.g. [[sleep apnea]]), or is enduring stressful events in his or her life. Adult night terrors are much less common, and often respond best to treatments that rectify causes of poor quality or quantity of sleep. There is no scientific evidence of a link between night terrors and mental illness.

==DSM-IV-TR diagnosis==
The '''DSM-IV-TR''' diagnostic criteria for '''sleep terror disorder''' requires:<ref name="AmericanPsychiatric" />
* recurrent periods where the individual abruptly wakes from sleeping with a scream
* the individual experiences intense fear and symptoms of ''[[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] arousal'' such as increased heart rate, heavy breathing, and increased perspiration
* the individual cannot be soothed or comforted during the episode
* the individual is unable to remember details of the dream or details of the episode
* the occurrence of the sleep terror episode causes ''clinically significant'' distress or impairment in the individual's functioning
* the disturbance is not due to the effects of a substance or general medical condition

==Adults==
Night terrors in adults have been reported in all age ranges.<ref name="Bevacqua 2007 36–38">{{cite journal|last=Bevacqua|first=B.K.|coauthors=Fattouh, M., & Backonja, M.|title=Depression, Night Terrors, and Insomnia Associated With Long-Term Intrathecal Clonidine Therapy|journal=Pain Practice|year=2007|volume=11|issue=1|pages=36–38|doi=10.1111/j.1533-2500.2007.00108.x}}</ref> Though the [[symptom]]s of night terrors in adolescents and adults are similar, the [[etiology]], [[prognosis]] and treatment are qualitatively different. These night terrors can occur each night if the sufferer does not eat a proper diet, get the appropriate amount or quality of sleep (e.g. [[sleep apnea]]), is enduring stressful events in their life or if they remain untreated. Adult night terrors are much less common, and often respond to treatments to rectify causes of poor quality or quantity of sleep. There is no scientific evidence of a link between night terrors and mental illness. A study done about night terrors in adults showed that psychiatric symptoms were prevalent in most patients experiencing night terrors hinting at the comorbidity of the two.<ref name="Nguyen 2008 e1164-e1167"/> There is some evidence of a link between adult night terrors and [[hypoglycemia]].<ref>Blog from Fountia, [http://www.fountia.com/things-you-didnt-know-about-night-terrors “Things You Didn’t Know About Night Terrors”]</ref>{{cn|date=March 2013}}<!-- a blog is not a reliable source! -->

When a night terror happens it is typical that person can wake themself up screaming, kicking, and often cannot recognize what they are saying. Often the person can even run out of the house (more common among adults) which can then lead to violent actions.<ref name="Sleep Terror">{{cite web|last=Kuhlmann|first=David|title=Sleep Terrors|url=http://yoursleep.aasmnet.org/disorder.aspx?id=13|publisher=The American Academy of Sleep Medicine|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}</ref> It has been found that some adults who have been on a long-term intrathecal clonidine therapy show side effects of night terrors, such as feelings of terror early in the sleep cycle.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Snyder|first=D.|coauthors=Goodlin-Jones, B. L., Pionk, M., & Stein, M. T|title=Inconsolable night-time awakening: Beyond night terrors|journal=Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics|year=2008|volume=29|issue=4|pages=311–314|doi=10.1097/DBP.0b013e3181829f4c|pmid=18698194}}</ref> This is due to the possible alteration of cervical/brain clonidine concentration.<ref name="Bevacqua 2007 36–38"/> In adults, night terrors can be symptomatic of neurological disease and can further investigate through an [[MRI]] procedure.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Guzman,|first=C.|coauthors=Wang, Y|title=Sleep terror disorder: A case report|journal=Revista Brasileira De Psiquiatria|year=2008|volume=115|issue=11|doi=10.1590/S1516-44462008000200016|pages=169}}</ref>

==Children==
The sleep disorder of night terrors typically occurs in children between the ages of three to twelve years, with a peak onset in children aged three and a half years old.<ref name="WebMD Terrors">{{Cite web|last=Connelly|first=Kevin|title=Night Terrors|url=http://children.webmd.com/guide/night-terrors|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref>
An estimated one to six percent of children experience night terrors. Boys and girls of all backgrounds are affected equally. The disorder usually resolves during adolescence.<ref name="WebMD Terrors" /> Sleep disruption is parents’ most frequent concern during the first years of a child’s life. Half of all children develop a disrupted sleep pattern serious enough to warrant physician assistance. In children younger than three and a half years old, peak frequency of night terrors is at least one episode per week. Among older children, peak frequency of night terrors is one or two episodes per month.  Children experiencing night terrors may be helped by a pediatric evaluation. During such evaluation, the pediatrician may also be able to exclude other possible disorders that might cause night terrors.<ref name="WebMD Terrors" />

==Treatment==
Reassuring the child will almost always outgrow this disorder is very important to treatment.<ref name=genaro/> There is some indication that night terrors can result from being overtired, in which case interventions such as creating a bedtime schedule can increase the chances of restful sleep. If the night terrors are more chronic, however, some evidence suggests that the sufferer should be awakened from sleep just before the time when the terrors typically occur to interrupt the sleep cycle. In some cases, a child who has night terrors will require additional comfort and reassurance during the day and before bedtime. [[Psychotherapy]] or counseling can be helpful in many cases. [[Benzodiazepine]] medications (such as [[diazepam]]) used at bedtime will often reduce the occurrence of night terrors; however, medication is rarely recommended to treat this disorder.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaneshiro|first=Neil|title=Night Terror|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000809.htm|publisher=A.D.A.M.|accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref>

Prevalence of night terrors is unknown or unclear because there have been very few epidemiological studies over time.<ref name="Nguyen 2008 e1164-e1167"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Talarczyk|first=W.|title=The authorial model of the therapy used in night terrors and sleep disorders in children|journal=Archives of Psychiatry & Psychotherapy|year=2011|volume=13|issue=2|pages=45–51}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bjorvatn|first=B.|coauthors=Grønli, J., & Pallesen, S|title=Prevalence of different parasomnias in the general population|journal=Sleep Medicine|year=2010|volume=11|issue=10|pages=1031–1034|doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2010.07.011|pmid=21093361}}</ref>
