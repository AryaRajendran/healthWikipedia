'''Hip dysplasia''', '''developmental dysplasia of the [[hip]] (DDH)'''<ref name="urlYour Orthopaedic Connection: Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip">{{cite web |url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00347 |title=Your Orthopaedic Connection: Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip |format= |work=}}</ref> or '''congenital dysplasia of the [[hip]] (CDH)'''<ref name="urlDefinition: congenital dysplasia of the hip from Online Medical Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?congenital+dysplasia+of+the+hip |title=Definition: congenital dysplasia of the hip from Online Medical Dictionary |format= |work=}}</ref> is a [[congenital]] or acquired deformation or misalignment of the [[hip joint]].

==Terminology==
Some sources prefer "developmental dysplasia of the hip" (DDH) to "congenital dislocation of the hip" (CDH), finding the latter term insufficiently flexible in describing the diversity of potential complications.<ref name="urlDevelopmental Dysplasia of the Hip - October 15, 2006 -- American Family Physician">{{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20061015/1310.html |title=Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip - October 15, 2006 -- American Family Physician |work=}}</ref>

The use of the word congenital can also imply that the condition already exists at birth.  This terminology introduces challenges, because the joint in a newborn is formed from [[cartilage]] and is still [[malleable]], making the onset difficult to ascertain.

The newer term DDH also encompasses [[occult]] dysplasia (e.g. an underdeveloped [[joint]]) without [[Joint dislocation|dislocation]] and a dislocation developing after the "[[Infant|newborn]]" phase.  

The term is not used consistently.  In pediatric/neonatal orthopedics it is used to describe unstable/dislocatable hips and poorly developed acetabula.  For adults it describes hips showing abnormal femur head or acetabular x-rays.<ref>[http://faculty.washington.edu/momus/PB/ddh.htm Dr. Rose's Peripheral Brain-DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.aafp.org/afp/990700ap/177.html Screening for Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip - July 1999 - American Academy of Family Physicians<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Some sources prefer the term "hip dysplasia" over DDH, considering it to be "simpler and more accurate", partly because of the redundancy created by the use of the terms [[developmental]] and [[dysplasia]].<ref name="urleMedicine - Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip: Article by James McCarthy, MD, FAAOS">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/topic456.htm |title=eMedicine - Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip : Article by James McCarthy, MD, FAAOS |work=}}</ref>
'''TYPES OF DDH''' include subluxation, dysplasia, and dislocation.  The main types are the result of either laxity of the supporting capsule or an abnormal acetabulum.

==Forms of the condition==
[[Image:Hip dysplasia - schematic.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Types of misalignments of femur head to socket in hip dysplasia. A: Normal. B: Dysplasia. C: Subluxation. D: Luxation]]
Hip dysplasia can range from barely detectable to severely malformed or dislocated. 
The [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] form, [[teratology|teratologic]] or non-reducible dislocation occurs as part of more complex conditions.  

The condition can be bilateral or unilateral:
* If both hip joints are affected one speaks of "bilateral" dysplasia.  In this case some diagnostic indicators like asymmetric folds and leg-length inequality do not apply.
* In unilateral dysplasia only one joint shows deformity, the contralateral side may show resulting effects.<ref name="pmid16721954">{{cite journal |author=Jacobsen S, Rømer L, Søballe K |title=The other hip in unilateral hip dysplasia |journal=[[Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res.]] |volume=446 |issue= |pages=239–46 |year=2006 |pmid=16721954 |doi=10.1097/01.blo.0000201151.91206.50}}</ref>  In the majority of unilateral cases the left hip has the dysplasia.
If the joint is fully dislocated a false acetabulum often forms (often higher up on the pelvis) opposite the dislocated femoral head position.

In actetabular dysplasia the [[acetabulum]] (socket) is too shallow or deformed.  The center-edge angle is measured as described by Wiberg.<ref>Wiberg G. Studies of acetabular and congenital subluxation of the hip joint with special reference to complication of osteoarthritis Acta Chir Scand 1939, 83(Suppl. 58)</ref>  In [[coxa vara]] the [[femur head]] grows at too narrow an angle to the shaft, in [[coxa valga]] the angle is too wide.

A rare type, the "Beukes familial hip dysplasia" is found among Afrikaners that are members of the Beukes family.  The femur head is flat and irregular.  Sufferers develop osteoarthritis at an early age.<ref name="pmid2389793">{{cite journal |author=Cilliers HJ, Beighton P |title=Beukes familial hip dysplasia: an autosomal dominant entity |journal=[[Am. J. Med. Genet.]] |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=386–90 |year=1990 |pmid=2389793 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320360403}}</ref>

==Crowe classification==

In 1979 Dr. John F. Crowe<ref>http://www.onsmd.com/Jon-F-Crowe-MD</ref> et al. proposed a classification to define the degree of malformation and dislocation. Grouped from least severe Crowe I dysplasia to most severe Crowe IV.<ref name="pmid365863">{{cite journal |author=Crowe JF, Mani VJ, Ranawat CS |title=Total hip replacement in congenital dislocation and dysplasia of the hip |journal=[[J Bone Joint Surg Am]] |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=15–23 |year=1979 |pmid=365863 |doi=}}</ref> This classification is very useful for studying treatment results. 

Rather than using the Wiberg angle because it makes it difficult to quantify the degree of dislocation they used 3 key elements to determine the degree of [[subluxation]]: A reference line at the lower rim of the "teardrop", junction between the femoral head and neck of the respective joint and the height of the pelvis (vertical measurement). They studied [[anteroposterior]] pelvic x-rays and drew horizontal lines through the lower rim of a feature called "teardrop". The distance between this line and the middle lines of the junction between femur head and neck gave them a measure of the degree of femur head subluxation. They further established that a "normal" diameter of the femur head measures 20% of the height of the pelvis.  If the middle line of the neck-head junction was more than 10% of the pelvis height above the reference line they considered the joint to be more than 50% dislocated.

The following types resulted:
{| class="wikitable"
| '''Class''' || '''Description''' || '''Dislocation''' 
 |- 
 | Crowe I || Femur and acetabulum show minimal abnormal development. || Less than 50% dislocation
 |- 
 | Crowe II || The acetabulum shows abnormal development.|| 50% to 75% dislocation
 |- 
 | Crowe III || The acetabula is developed without a roof.  A false acetabulum develops opposite the dislocated femur head position.  The joint is fully dislocated. || 75% to 100% dislocation
 |- 
 | Crowe IV  || The acetabulum is insufficiently developed.  Since the femur is positioned high up on the pelvis this class is also known as "high hip dislocation". || 100% dislocation
|}

==Incidence==
Determining the incidence can be difficult.<ref name="pmid9917445">{{cite journal |author=Bialik V, Bialik GM, Blazer S, Sujov P, Wiener F, Berant M |title=Developmental dysplasia of the hip: a new approach to incidence |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=93–9 |year=1999 |pmid=9917445 |doi= 10.1542/peds.103.1.93|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9917445}}</ref><ref name="pmid17972535">{{cite journal |author=Kokavec M, Bialik V |title=Developmental dysplasia of the hip. Prevention and real incidence |journal=[[Bratisl Lek Listy]] |volume=108 |issue=6 |pages=251–4 |year=2007 |pmid=17972535 |doi=}}</ref>  In addition there is a wide margin in diagnostic results. A German study comparing two methods resulted in twice the usual rate for one method. 

An instability rate of 1:60 has been described, though this rate drops to 1:240 at one week.<ref name="urlUNSW Embryology- Musculoskeletal System - Abnormalities">{{cite web |url=http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/Notes/skmus2.htm |title=UNSW Embryology- Musculoskeletal System - Abnormalities |work=}}</ref> The condition is eight times more frequent in females than in males.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;105/4/896 Clinical Practice Guideline: Early Detection of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip - Committee on Quality Improvement, Subcommittee on Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip 105 (4): 896 - AAP Policy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Causes==

{{cleanup|section|date=November 2008}}

Hip dysplasia is considered to be a [[multifactorial inheritance|multifactorial]] condition. That means that several factors are involved in causing the condition to manifest.<ref>Lynn T Staheli, Fundamentals of Pediatric Orthopedics, p 13</ref> Cause is unknown but common in breech position or large fetal size.

===Congenital===

Some studies suggest a hormonal link.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Specifically the hormone [[relaxin]] has been indicated.<ref name="pmid9128773">{{cite journal |author=Forst J, Forst C, Forst R, Heller KD |title=Pathogenetic relevance of the pregnancy hormone relaxin to inborn hip instability |journal=Arch Orthop Trauma Surg |volume=116 |issue=4 |pages=209–12 |year=1997 |pmid=9128773 |doi= 10.1007/BF00393711|url=}}</ref>

A genetic factor is indicated by the trait running in families and increased occurrence in some ethnic populations (e.g. [[Native Americans in the United States|native Americans]],<ref>[http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-263161-6.pdf CHSC01<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Lapps<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/110503598 The occurrence of hip joint dislocation in early Lappic populations of Norway],

Nor. Laegeforen.]] |volume=120 |issue=22 |pages=2672–3 |year=2000 |pmid=11077514 |doi=}}</ref>). A locus has been described on [[chromosome 13]].<ref name="pmid16773577">{{cite journal |author=Mabuchi A, Nakamura S, Takatori Y, Ikegawa S |title=Familial osteoarthritis of the hip joint associated with acetabular dysplasia maps to chromosome 13q |journal=[[Am.

===Acquired===
As an acquired condition it has often been linked to traditions of [[swaddling]] infants,<ref name="pmid18166571">{{cite journal |author=Mahan ST, Kasser JR |title=Does swaddling influence developmental dysplasia of the hip? |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=177–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18166571 |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-1618 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18166571}}</ref> use of overly restrictive baby seats, carriers and other methods of transporting babies,<ref name="IHDI Educational Statement">{{cite web|title=Baby Carriers, Seats, & Other Equipment - International Hip Dysplasia Institute|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/prevention/baby-carriers-seats-and-other-equipment/}}</ref> or use of a [[cradle board]] which locks the hip joint in an "adducted" position (pulling the knees together tends to pull the heads of the femur bone out of the sockets or acetabulae) for extended periods. Modern swaddling techniques have been developed to relieve stress on hip joints caused by traditional swaddling methods.<ref name="Hip-Healthy Swaddling">{{cite web|title=Hip-Healthy Swaddling - International Hip Dysplasia Institute|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/hip-healthy-swaddling/}}</ref>

Further risk factors include [[breech birth]], genetics (family history),<ref name="Causes of DDH">{{cite web|title=Causes of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip - International Hip Dysplasia Institute|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/causes-of-ddh/}}</ref> and firstborns.<ref name="urlDevelopmental Dislocation of the Hip - Wheeless Textbook of Orthopaedics">{{cite web |url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/developmental_dislocation_of_the_hip |title=Developmental Dislocation of the Hip - Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics |format= |work=}}</ref> In breech position the femoral head tends to get pushed out of the socket.  A narrow uterus also facilitates hip joint dislocation during fetal development and birth.

==Diagnostics==
Most countries have standard newborn exams that include a hip joint exam [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] for early detection of hip dysplasia.  
Sometimes during an exam a "click" or more precisely "clunk" in the hip may be detected<ref name="urlHipDysplasia - Newborn Nursery at LPCH - Stanford University School of Medicine">{{cite web |url=http://newborns.stanford.edu/HipDysplasia.html |title=HipDysplasia - Newborn Nursery at LPCH - Stanford University School of Medicine |work=}}</ref> (although not all clicks indicate hip dysplasia).<ref name="pmid15977515">{{cite journal |author=Kamath S, Bramley D |title=Is 'clicky hip' a risk factor in developmental dysplasia of the hip? |journal=[[Scott Med J]] |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=56–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15977515 |doi=}}</ref>  When a hip click (also known as "clicky hips" in the UK) is detected, the child's hips are tracked with additional screenings<ref name="Newborn Screening and Prevention">{{cite web|title=Newborn Screening and Prevention - International Hip Dysplasia Institute|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/for-physicians/pediatricians-and-primary-care-providers/newborn-screening-and-prevention/}}</ref> to determine if developmental dysplasia of the hip is caused.<ref name="Hip Clicks">{{cite web|title=Hip Clicks and Hip Dysplasia - International Hip Dysplasia Institute|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/infant-signs-and-symptoms/hip-click/}}</ref>

Two maneuvers commonly employed for diagnosis in neonatal exams are the [[Ortolani maneuver]] and the [[Barlow maneuver]].<ref name="Physical Examination of Infants">{{cite web|title=Physical Examination of Infants - International Hip Dysplasia Institute|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/for-physicians/pediatricians-and-primary-care-providers/infant-examination/}}</ref> 

[[File:Hip dysplasia ultrasound.svg|thumb|300px|α and β angles used in hip ultrasound]]
[[File:Ultrasound Scan ND 0114142455 1429140 crop.png|thumb|300px|Hip ultrasound]]
The condition can be confirmed by [[ultrasound]]<ref name="Ultrasound detection of DDH">{{cite web|title=Ultrasound Detection of DDH - International Hip Dysplasia Institute|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/infant-diagnosis/ultrasound/}}</ref> and [[X-ray]].<ref name="X-Ray Screening">{{cite web|title=X-Ray Screening for Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip - International Hip Dysplasia Institute|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/infant-diagnosis/x-ray-screening/}}</ref>  Ultrasound imaging yields better results defining the anatomy until the cartilage is [[ossified]].  When the infant is around 3 months old a clear roentgenographic image can be achieved.  Unfortunately the time the joint gives a good x-ray image is also the point at which nonsurgical treatment methods cease to give good results.  In x-ray imaging dislocation may be indicated if the Shenton's line (an arc drawn from the medial aspect of the [[femoral neck]] through the superior margin of the [[obturator foramen]]<ref name="urlShentons line (www.whonamedit.com)">{{cite web |url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2456.html |title=Shenton's line (www.whonamedit.com) |work=}}</ref>) does not result in a smooth arc. However in infants this line can be unreliable as it depends on the rotation of the hip when the image is taken (<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/radiographic_features_ddh |title=Radiographic features: DDH | format= | work=Weeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics}}</ref>)

</gallery>

Asymmetrical [[gluteal fold]]s and an apparent limb-length inequality can further indicate unilateral hip dysplasia.<ref name="Symptoms of DDH in Children">{{cite web|title=Asymmetry Symptoms of DDH |url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/infant-signs-and-symptoms/asymmetry/}}</ref>  Most vexingly, many newborn hips show a certain [[ligamentous laxity]], on the other hand severely malformed joints can appear stable.  That is one reason why follow-up exams and developmental monitoring are important.  Frequency and methods of routine screenings in children is still in debate however physical examination of newborns followed by appropriate use of hip ultrasound is widely accepted.<ref name="Physician Newborn Screening and Prevention">{{cite web|title=Physician Newborn Screening and Prevention - International Hip Dysplasia Institute|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/for-physicians/pediatricians-and-primary-care-providers/newborn-screening-and-prevention/}}</ref>

The Harris hip score<ref>[http://www.orthopaedicscore.com/scorepages/harris_hip_score.html Harris Hip Score - Orthopaedic Scores<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (developed by William H. Harris MD, an orthopedist from Massachusetts) is one way to evaluate hip function following surgery. Other scoring methods are based on patients' evaluation like e.g. the Oxford hip score, HOOS and [[WOMAC]] score.<ref name="pmid16259627">{{cite journal |author=Wylde V, Learmonth ID, Cavendish VJ |title=The Oxford hip score: the patient's perspective |journal=[[Health Qual Life Outcomes]] |volume=3 |issue= |pages=66 |year=2005 |pmid=16259627 |doi=10.1186/1477-7525-3-66 |url=http://www.hqlo.com/content/3//66 |pmc=1283979}}</ref> Children's Hospital Oakland Hip Evaluation Scale (CHOHES) is a modification of the Harris hip score that is currently being evaluated.<ref name="pmid16003666">{{cite journal |author=Aguilar CM, Neumayr LD, Eggleston BE, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical evaluation of avascular necrosis in patients with sickle cell disease: Children's Hospital Oakland Hip Evaluation Scale--a modification of the Harris Hip Score |journal=[[Arch Phys Med Rehabil]] |volume=86 |issue=7 |pages=1369–75 |year=2005 |pmid=16003666 |doi= 10.1016/j.apmr.2005.01.008|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003999305002145}}</ref>

Hip dysplasia can develop in older age. Adolescents and adults with hip dysplasia may present with hip pain and in some cases hip labral tears. X-rays are used to confirm a diagnosis of hip dysplasia. CT scans and MRI scans are occasionally used too.<ref>Betsy Miller, The Parents' Guide to Hip Dysplasia, p 19.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Sutherland |first=Denise |last2=West |first2=Sophie |title=A Guide for Adults with Hip Dysplasia |url=http://sutherland-studios.com.au/books/hip-dysplasia.php |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-9872152-0-8 |pages=7,21-23 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
Given the very real possibility of a limp, constant and/or debilitating pain, complicated treatment and impaired mobility later in life, careful developmental monitoring and early intervention are indicated. The worst possible consequence of non treatment is developing early arthritis, sometimes even during teenage years. All treatment aims to delay the onset of arthritis, but no treatment is fully successful in avoiding it.

===Harnesses, casts, and traction===
Early hip dysplasia can often be treated using a Pavlik harness<ref name="Pavlik Harness for Hip Dysplasia">{{cite web|title=Pavlik Harness |url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/child-treatment-methods/pavlik-harness/}}</ref> (see photograph) or the Frejka pillow/splint<ref name="pmid17676003">{{cite journal |author=Czubak J, Piontek T, Niciejewski K, Magnowski P, Majek M, Płończak M |title=Retrospective analysis of the non-surgical treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip using Pavlik harness and Fredjka pillow: comparison of both methods |journal=[[Ortop Traumatol Rehabil]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=9–13 |year=2004 |pmid=17676003 |doi=}}</ref> in the first year of life with usually normal results.  Complications can occur when using the Pavlik Harness.  Cases of Femoral Nerve Palsy<ref name="Femoral Nerve Palsy and the Pavlik Harness">{{cite web|title=Femoral Nerve Palsy|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/child-treatment-methods/femoral-nerve-palsy/z}}</ref> and Avascular Necrosis of the femoral head have been reported with the use of the Pavlik harness,<ref name="pmid17322441">{{cite journal |author=Nakamura J, Kamegaya M, Saisu T, Someya M, Koizumi W, Moriya H |title=Treatment for developmental dysplasia of the hip using the Pavlik harness: long-term results |journal=[[J Bone Joint Surg Br]] |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=230–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17322441 |doi=10.1302/0301-620X.89B2.18057 |url=http://www.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17322441}}</ref> but whether these cases were due to improper application of the device or a complication encountered in the course of the disorder remains unresolved. Complications arise mainly because the sheet of the iliopsoas muscle pushes circumflex artery against the neck of the femur and decreases blood flow to the femoral head. That is the reason why the Frejka pillow is not indicated in all the forms of the developmental dysplasia of the hip.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

</gallery>

Other devices employed include the [[spica cast]],<ref name="Spica Cast for DDH">{{cite web|title=Hip Spica Cast for Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/child-treatment-methods/hip-spica-cast/}}</ref> particularly following surgical closed reduction, open reduction, or osteotomy in babies and young children.  [[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] is sometimes used in the weeks leading up to a surgery to help stretch ligaments in the hip joint, although its use is controversial and varies amongst physicians.<ref name="Traction with DDH Treatment">{{cite web|title=Traction with DDH Treatment|url=http://www.hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/child-treatment-methods/traction/}}</ref>

===Surgery===
In older children  the adductor and [[Hip flexors|iliopsoas muscles]] may have to be treated surgically because they adapt to the dislocated joint position ([[contracture]]). 
Braces and splints are often used following either of these methods to continue treatment.  
Although some children "outgrow" untreated mild hip dysplasia<ref name=autogenerated1 /> and some forms of untreated dysplasia cause little or no impairment of quality of life, studies have as yet been unable to find a method of predicting outcomes. On the other hand, it has often been documented that starting treatment late leads to complications and ends in poor results.

===Stem cells===
One avenue of research is using [[stem cells]].  They are applied in grafting ([[bone grafting]]) or by seeding porous arthroplasty prosthesis with [[autologous]] [[fibroblasts]] or [[chondrocyte]] [[progenitor cells]] to assist in firmly anchoring the artificial material in the bone bed.

===Hip replacement and osteotomy===
Hip dysplasia is often cited as causing [[osteoarthritis]] of the hip at a comparatively young age.  Dislocated load bearing surfaces lead to increased and unusual wear.  Although there are studies that contradict these findings.  (see <ref name="pmid8546528">{{cite journal |author=Lau EM, Lin F, Lam D, Silman A, Croft P |title=Hip osteoarthritis and dysplasia in Chinese men |journal=[[Ann. Rheum. Dis.]] |volume=54 |issue=12 |pages=965–9 |year=1995 |pmid=8546528 |doi= 10.1136/ard.54.12.965|url=http://ard.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8546528 |pmc=1010061}}</ref><ref name="pmid15140766">{{cite journal |author=Lievense AM, Bierma-Zeinstra SM, Verhagen AP, Verhaar JA, Koes BW |title=Influence of hip dysplasia on the development of osteoarthritis of the hip |journal=[[Ann.

Subsequent treatment with total hip [[arthroplasty]] ([[hip replacement]]) is complicated by a need for revision surgery (replacing the artificial joint) owing to skeletal changes as the body matures, loosening/wear or bone resorption. Hip resurfacing is another option for correcting hip dysplasia in adults. It is a type of hip replacement that preserves more bone, and may work for younger hip dysplasia patients. <ref>{{cite book |last=Sutherland |first=Denise |last2=West |first2=Sophie |title=A Guide for Adults with Hip Dysplasia |url=http://sutherland-studios.com.au/books/hip-dysplasia.php |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-9872152-0-8 |pages=56-59 }}</ref>

[[osteotomy|Osteotomies]] are either used in conjunction with [[arthroplasty]] or by themselves to correct misalignment.

==Cultural references==
