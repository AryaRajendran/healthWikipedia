The '''vestibular bulbs''', also known as the '''clitoral bulbs''', are aggregations of erectile tissue that are an internal part of the [[clitoris]]. They can also be found throughout the vestibule: next to the [[clitoral body]], [[clitoral crura]], [[urethra]], [[urethral sponge]], and [[vagina]].

They are to the left and right of the urethra, urethral sponge, and vagina.

The vestibular bulbs are homologous to the [[bulb of penis]] and adjoining part of the [[corpus spongiosum]] of the male, and consists of two elongated masses of erectile tissue, placed one on either side of the [[vaginal orifice]] and united to each other in front by a narrow median band termed the ''pars intermedia''. 

Their posterior ends are expanded and are in contact with the [[greater vestibular glands]]; their anterior ends are tapered and joined to one another by the pars intermedia; their deep surfaces are in contact with the inferior fascia of the [[urogenital diaphragm]]; superficially they are covered by the [[bulbospongiosus]].

==Physiology==
During the response to [[sexual arousal]] the bulbs fill with blood, which then becomes trapped, causing [[erection]].  As the clitoral bulbs fill with blood, they tightly cuff the vaginal opening, causing the vulva to expand outward. Nearby structures this may put pressure on include the [[corpus cavernosum of clitoris]] and [[crus of clitoris]].

The blood inside the bulbâ€™s [[erectile tissue]] is released to the circulatory system by the spasms of [[orgasm]], but if orgasm does not occur, the blood will exit the bulbs over several hours.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chalker |first=Rebecca|year=2000 |title=The Clitoral Truth. |publisher= Seven Seas Press |isbn=1-58322-473-4|page=200}}</ref>
