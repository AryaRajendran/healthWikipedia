'''Alexander disease''' is a slowly progressing and fatal [[neurodegenerative disease]]. It is a very rare disorder which results from a [[genetic mutation]] and mostly affects infants and children, causing [[developmental delay]] and changes in physical characteristics.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-38896449.html "MUTATION KEY TO ALEXANDER DISEASE" - United Press International]</ref><ref name="Gene">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1172/ GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Alexander disease]</ref><ref name="NINDS"  />

==Cause==
Alexander disease is a genetic disorder affecting the central nervous system ([[midbrain]] and [[cerebellum]]). It is caused by mutations in the [[gene]] for [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]] (GFAP) that maps to [[Chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]]q21. It is inherited in an Autosomal Dominant manner, such that the child of a parent with the disease has a 50/50 chance of inheriting the condition<ref name="Gene" />

Alexander disease belongs to [[leukodystrophies]], a group of diseases which affect growth or development of the [[myelin sheath]]. The destruction of [[white matter]] in the [[brain]] is accompanied by the formation of fibrous, [[eosinophilic]] deposits known as [[Rosenthal fiber]]s.<ref name="Gene" /><ref name="NINDS">{{NINDS|alexander_disease}}</ref><ref name="BBC">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1097277.stm "Cause of brain disease found" -BBC News]</ref> [[Rosenthal fibers]] appear not to be present in healthy people,<ref name="NINDS"  /><ref name="Alexander"  /> but occur in specific diseases, like some forms of [[cancer]].<ref name="NINDS"  /><ref name="Alexander"  />  The [[Rosenthal fibers]] found in Alexander disease are not distributed in the same areas or as concentrated when compared to other diseases and disorders.<ref name="NINDS"  />

==Clinical features==
Delays in development of some physical, psychological and behavioral skills, progressive enlargement of the head ([[macrocephaly]]), [[seizures]], [[spasticity]], in some cases also [[hydrocephalus]], [[dementia]].<ref name="Gene"/>

==Pathology==
Alexander disease causes the affected person to slowly begin to lose body function and eventually the ability to talk. It also causes an overload of long chain fatty acids that the body cannot dispose of. This overload of fatty acids builds up in the brain and destroys the myelin sheath. The cause of Alexander disease is a mutation in the gene encoding [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]].<ref name="Gene" /><ref name="NINDS"  /><ref name="Alexander"  /><ref name="BBC" /><ref name="Adult">{{cite journal |author=Farina L, Pareyson D, Minati L, ''et al.'' |title=Can MR imaging diagnose adult-onset Alexander disease? |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=1190–6 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18388212 |doi=10.3174/ajnr.A1060 |url=http://www.ajnr.org/content/29/6/1190.full}}</ref>

[[computed tomography|CT]] shows:
* decreased density of [[white matter]]
* [[frontal lobe]] predominance
* +/- dilated [[lateral ventricles]]

==Diagnosis==
It is possible to detect the signs of Alexander disease with Magnetic Resonance Imaging, which looks for specific changes in the brain that may be tell-tale signs for the disease.<ref name="Alexander"  /><ref>{{cite journal |author=van der Knaap MS, Naidu S, Breiter SN, ''et al.'' |title=Alexander disease: diagnosis with MR imaging |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=541–52 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11237983 |url=http://www.ajnr.org/content/22/3/541.full}}</ref> It is even possible to detect adult-onset Alexander disease with MR imaging.<ref name="Adult" /> Alexander disease may also be revealed by [[genetic testing]] for the known cause of Alexander disease.<ref name="Alexander">http://www.ulf.org/types/Alexander.html</ref>  A rough diagnosis may also be made through revealing of [[clinical symptom]]s including, enlarged head size, along with [[radiological studies]], and negative tests for other [[leukodystrophies]].<ref name="Alexander" />

==Occurrence and prevalence==
Its occurrence is very rare. The infantile form (63% of all cases) starts usually at the age of six months or within the first two years. The average duration of the infantile form of the illness is usually about 3 years. Onset of the juvenile form (24% of all cases) presents usually between four to ten years of age. Duration of this form is in most cases about 6 years. In younger patients, [[seizures]], [[megalencephaly]], [[developmental delay]], and [[spasticity]] are usually present. Neonatal onset is also reported. Onset in adults is least frequent. In older patients, [[bulbar]] or [[pseudobulbar]] symptoms and [[spasticity]] predominate. Symptoms of the adult form may also resemble [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name="Gene" />

There are no more than 500 reported cases.<ref name="Gene" />

==Treatment==
There is currently no cure, or standard procedure taken for treatment.<ref name="Gene" /><ref name="NINDS"  /><ref name="Alexander"  /> A [[bone marrow transplant]] has been attempted on a child, but did not cause the patient's condition to improve.<ref name="Alexander"  /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Staba MJ, Goldman S, Johnson FL, Huttenlocher PR |title=Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for Alexander's disease |journal=Bone Marrow Transplant. |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=247–9 |year=1997 |month=August |pmid=9257894 |doi=10.1038/sj.bmt.1700871 |url=http://www.nature.com/bmt/journal/v20/n3/abs/1700871a.html}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is generally poor. With early onset, death usually occurs within 10 years after the onset of symptoms. Usually, the later the disease occurs, the slower its course is.<ref name="Gene" /><ref name="NINDS"  />
