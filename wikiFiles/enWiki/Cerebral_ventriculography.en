'''Cerebral ventriculography''' is a medical procedure developed by [[Walter Dandy]], and designed to enable visualization of structures inside the skull. In this procedure, holes are drilled in the skull, and air pumped through the holes in to the [[Ventricular system|ventricle]]s,<ref>{{MeshName|Cerebral+Ventriculography}}</ref> to facilitate clearer imaging on [[X-ray]]s. 

It has been replaced by more effective and less invasive imaging techniques.
