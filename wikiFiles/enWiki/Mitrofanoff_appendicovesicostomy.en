'''Mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy''', also known as the '''Mitrofanoff procedure''', is a [[surgical procedure]] in which the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]] is used to create a conduit between the skin surface and the [[urinary bladder]]. It was named after its discoverer, [[Paul Mitrofanoff]]. <ref name=mingin>{{cite journal |author=Mingin GC, Baskin LS |title=Surgical management of the neurogenic bladder and bowel |journal=Int Braz J Urol |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=53–61 |year=2003 |pmid=15745470 |doi= 10.1590/S1677-55382003000100012|url=http://www.brazjurol.com.br/january_february_2003/Baskin_ing_53_61.htm}}</ref>

==Description of procedure==
In the procedure, the [[surgeon]] separates the appendix from its attachment to the cecum, while maintaining its blood supply, then creates an opening at its blind end and washes it. One end is connected by surgical sutures to the urinary bladder, and the other is connected to the skin to form a [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]].  Generally, an incision is made into the umbilicus so it may serve as the canal for the catheter.  

Urine is typically drained several times a day by use of a catheter inserted into the Mitrofanoff canal.

==Indications==
The procedure is typically performed when the normal outlet is blocked (as in [[urethral cancer]]) or when frequent, often uncomfortable, [[foley catheter|catheterizations]] are needed (as in [[neurogenic bladder]]).  

The most common patients who undergo this procedure are those who are dependent on catheterization to eliminate urine, such as [[paraplegic]] individuals or those born with [[spina bifida]].  The Mitrofanoff procedure allows the individual to self-catheterize, so assistance from a family member or a medical professional is not needed.

The Mitrofanoff procedure has been found to improve the lives of people with [[spinal cord injuries]], by increasing their independence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Merenda LA, Duffy T, Betz RR, Mulcahey MJ, Dean G, Pontari M |title=Outcomes of Urinary Diversion in Children With Spinal Cord Injuries |journal=J Spinal Cord Med |volume=30 Suppl 1 |issue= Suppl 1|pages=S41–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17874686 |doi= |url= |pmc=2031994}}</ref>

==Relation to MACE==
The ''[[Malone antegrade continence enema]]'' (MACE), used to treat [[fecal incontinence]], is like the Mitrofanoff procedure as it uses the ''[[Mitrofanoff principle]]'' and, thus, can be considered an analogous procedure.  

As fecal and urinary incontinence frequently co-exist, a MACE is often created at the same time as a continent [[urinary catheter|catheterizable]] urinary conduit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Teichman JM, Rogenes VJ, Barber DB |title=The utility of the Malone antegrade continence enema for urologists |journal=Tech Urol |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=30–3 |year=1997 |pmid=9170222 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Relation to Monti procedure==
If the [[vermiform appendix]] is not available, due to [[appendectomy]], or unusable for another reason, the [[Monti procedure]] is done.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shapiro E |title=Early Clinical Experience With Monti Procedure and Managing the Nonpalpable Testis in Children |journal=Rev Urol |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=94–6 |year=1999 |pmid=16985779 |doi= |pmc=1476142}}</ref>
