==Career==
===Medical===
Cohen joined the [[Yale School of Medicine]] in 1972.<ref name=YaleBulletin/>  Along with other researchers, he had begun looking at non-psychological (organic) causes for [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS) by 1976.<ref>Kushner, HI. [http://books.google.com/books?id=9dQEB_MbhKEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0674003861&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false ''A Cursing Brain? : The Histories of Tourette Syndrome''.]  Harvard University Press, 2000, p. 182. ISBN 0-674-00386-1</ref>  Cohen was named the director of the [[Yale Child Study Center]] in 1983—a position he held until his death in 2001.<ref name=YaleBulletin/>  In 2000, he was named the Sterling Professor of Child Psychiatry, Pediatrics and Psychology at Yale.<ref name=YaleBulletin/>  At Yale, he studied personality development, [[Treatment of Tourette syndrome|TS treatment]], the effects of stress on developing children, the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in neuropsychiatric disorders.<ref name=Goode/>  

According to a former commissioner of the [[Food and Drug Administration]], Cohen "moved child psychiatry into the biological era, but he continued to put emphasis on the psychological and social aspects affecting child development".<ref name=Goode/>  According to the ''Yale Bulletin'', Cohen made "groundbreaking contributions in biological psychiatry, clinical care and the development of international collaborations in child psychiatry".<ref name=YaleBulletin/> As a "pioneer" in autism and Tourette syndrome research, he proposed treatments for TS which "opened new avenues to treating and understanding the disorder".<ref name=YaleBulletin/>  His colleague Andrés Martin said his work with autism "was in large part devoted to understanding and listening to those same individuals who had been written off as incapable of communicating meaningfully and to following the string of their social communicative mishaps to their deepest core".<ref name=Martin/> 

At Yale, Cohen helped found the International Working Group on Children and War,<ref name=Goode/> and the Yale-New Haven Child Development Community Policing Program, to train first responders to help children exposed to violence and trauma;<ref name=YaleBulletin/>  police were trained to call in the Yale Child Study Center professionals in instances of violence or trauma involving children.<ref name=StressNetwork/> Martin said, "he dedicated much of his later career to addressing the mental health needs of children in poor and war-torn nations".<ref name=Martin/>

===Appointments===

Cohen became a vice-president of the [[International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions]] (IACAPAP) in 1986,<ref name=Centennial>{{cite web |url=http://iacapap.org/wp-content/uploads/Bulletin-29.pdf |format=PDF |publisher= International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions |title= The Yale Child Study Center Centennial |pages= 9–19|date= June 2011 |accessdate= April 17, 2012}}</ref> and was president from 1992–98,<ref name=Martin/> where his work fostered "international collaborations in research and clinical care".<ref name=YaleBulletin/>   According to the ''Yale Bulletin'', he was proud of his work in helping to promote child psychiatry in Gaza and in creating the Eastern Mediterranean Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions (EMACAPAP), for which he served as chair of the international scientific committee.<ref name=YaleBulletin/> He served as vice-president of the board of governors of Yale University Press,<ref name=YaleBulletin/> was an analyst at the [[Western New England Institute of Psychoanalysis]], and was a member of the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=Goode/>  He held additional chair appointments with the Child Health and Development Institute, the International President of the Telefon Azzuro Foundation in Italy, and Schneider Children's Hospital of Israel.<ref name=YaleBulletin/>  He served on editorial boards in the United States as well as in France, Israel, and Great Britain.<ref name=YaleBulletin/>

===Other achievements===

Cohen was also known as an "institutional builder";<ref name=YaleBulletin/>  he is credited with transforming three buildings at Yale to help give the Yale Child Study Center prominence (the Children's Psychiatric Inpatient Service, the Harris-Provence Child Development Unit, and the Nelson and Irving Harris Building), obtaining "prominent and central locations at the medical school for each of these buildings".<ref name=Martin/> He also helped bring [[Kashrut|kosher kitchens]] to the University.<ref name=Martin/>

==Publications==

Cohen authored or co-authored more than 300 professional articles and 159 book chapters, including "the definitive textbooks on [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s and on [[tic disorder]]s";<ref name=StressNetwork/> his books include:
* ''Handbook of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Diagnosis, Development, Neurobiology, and Behavior (volume 1)'', ISBN 978-0471716969

He inspired the production of the "first Israeli textbook of child psychiatry in Hebrew, the first modern textbook of child psychiatry in China and a new textbook of child psychiatry in South Korea".<ref name=YaleBulletin/>

==Legacy==
Colleagues said Cohen "blended a profound spirituality with a broad understanding of science and clinical work";<ref name=Goode/> friend [[Joe Lieberman]] described him as someone who "did more in his 61 years than most anyone else could ever hope to accomplish in a lifetime ... a true professional, and caregiver and friend to the thousands of people who had the good fortune of knowing him" and a person who "dedicated his life to helping children and adolescents ... working tirelessly to develop and promote programs to assist children".<ref name=Lieberman>{{cite web |url= http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/12/20/S13940_honoring-dr-donald-j-cohen/ |title= Honoring Dr. Donald J. Cohen |author= [[Joe Lieberman|Lieberman, Joseph A.]] |publisher= Sunlight Foundation |work= Capitolwords.org |date= December 20, 2001 |accessdate= April 15, 2012}}</ref>  He was described as "a humanist, with tremendous compassion and insight into his patients".<ref name=StressNetwork/> Colleague [[James F. Leckman]] said, "He fostered the development of the next generation of academic child psychiatrists from many countries, in Europe, Korea, China, as well as Israel",<ref name=Goode/> and described him as "committed to forging closer ties between Israel and Palestine through contacts and visits with various psychiatrists, psychologists, and social service agencies active in Gaza and the West Bank."<ref name=Centennial/>

According to Leckman and colleague Joseph L. Woolston, Cohen's "ability to put children and adults at ease" was "just magical";<ref name=Goode/> Leckman said of Cohen, "To be a good child psychiatrist, you have to be a child at heart, and Donald was always willing to be sort of down there on the floor with the kids."<ref name=Goode/>  But he was also known for engaging parents; according to the [[National Child Traumatic Stress Network]]:<blockquote>Regardless of the disorder he was studying, Dr. Cohen engaged parents to an unprecedented degree. He took their advice in designing his studies and shared his papers with them before submitting them for publication. He called this approach, "participatory research," and the children's families loved him for it.<ref name=StressNetwork/></blockquote>

According to [[Joe Lieberman]]:<blockquote>I recently learned from my colleague, [[Chris Dodd|Senator Dodd]], that Dr. Cohen was the first person to suggest a special health insurance program for children that ultimately became the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|Children's Health Insurance Program]]. Today, this program throughout the Nation provides health care for millions of children who would otherwise go without the basic care they need to grow up healthy and flourish.<ref name=Lieberman/></blockquote>
