'''Congenital amputation''' is a [[congenital disorder]] that can be caused by [[amniotic band syndrome|fibrous bands of the amnion]] that constrict [[foetus|foetal]] limbs to such an extent that they fall off due to missing blood supply. The child is born without one or more limbs or without parts of limbs ([[Amelia (birth defect)|amelia]]).

==Causes==
Congenital amputations can result from a number of causes.  One common cause is [[amniotic band syndrome]], which occurs when the inner fetal membrane ([[amnion]]) ruptures without injury to the outer membrane ([[chorion]]). Fibrous bands from the ruptured amnion float in the amniotic fluid and can get entangled with the fetus, thus reducing blood supply to the developing limbs to such an extent that the limbs can become strangulated, the tissues die and are absorbed into the amniotic fluid.
Amnion ruptures can be caused by:
* [[teratogenesis|teratogenic]] drugs (e.g. [[thalidomide]], which causes [[phocomelia]]), or environmental chemicals
* ionizing radiation ([[atomic weapons]], [[radioiodine]], [[radiation therapy]])
* infections
* metabolic imbalance
* [[Physical trauma|trauma]]

==Treatment==
In rare cases, if diagnosed in utero, [[fetal surgery]] may be considered to save a limb which is in danger of [[amputation]].

==See also==
The term "congenital amputation" is sometimes used loosely to mean "[[congenital absence]]".
