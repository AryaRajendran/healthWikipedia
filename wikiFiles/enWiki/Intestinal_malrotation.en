'''Intestinal malrotation''' is a [[congenital]] anomaly of rotation of the [[midgut]] (embryologically, the gut undergoes a complex rotation outside the abdomen). As a result:
* the [[small bowel]] is found predominantly on the right side of the [[abdomen]]
* the [[cecum]] is displaced (from its usual position in the [[right lower quadrant]]) into the [[epigastrium]] - right [[hypochondrium]]
* the [[ligament of Treitz]] is displaced inferiorly and rightward
* fibrous [[Ladd's bands|bands (of Ladd)]] course over the horizontal part of the [[duodenum]] (DII), causing [[intestinal obstruction]].
* the [[small intestine]] has an unusually narrow base, and therefore the midgut is prone to [[volvulus]] (a twisting that can obstruct the [[mesenteric]] blood vessels and cause intestinal [[ischemia]]).

==Associated conditions==
This can lead to a number of disease manifestations such as:
* Acute midgut volvulus
* Chronic midgut volvulus
* Acute duodenal obstruction
* Chronic duodenal obstruction
* Internal herniation
* [[Superior mesenteric artery syndrome]]

==Causes==
The exact causes are not known. It is not associated with a particular gene, but there is some evidence of recurrence in families.<ref name="pmid1519649">{{cite journal |author=Stalker HJ, Chitayat D |title=Familial intestinal malrotation with midgut volvulus and facial anomalies: a disorder involving a gene controlling the normal gut rotation? |journal=Am. J. Med. Genet. |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=46–7 |year=1992 |pmid=1519649 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320440111}}</ref>

==Presentation==
Patients (often infants) present acutely with [[midgut volvulus]], manifested by [[bilious]] [[vomiting]], crampy abdominal pain, abdominal [[distention]], and the passage of blood and [[mucus]] in their [[human feces|stool]].  Patients with [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]], uncorrected malrotation can have recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting.

Malrotation can also be entirely asymptomatic.

==Diagnosis==
With acutely ill patients, consider emergency surgery [[laparotomy]] if there is a high index of suspicion.

Plain radiography may demonstrate signs of duodenal obstruction with dilatation of the proximal duodenum and stomach but it is often non-specific. [[Upper gastrointestinal series]] is the modality of choice for the evaluation of malrotation as it will show an abnormal position of the duodeno-jejunal flexure ([[ligament of Treitz]]). In cases of malrotation complicated with volvulus, it demonstrates a corkscrew appearance of the distal duodenum and jejunum. In cases of obstructing Ladd bands, it will reveal a duodenal obstruction.

In equivocal cases, [[Radiocontrast|contrast]] [[enema]], may be helpful by showing the [[caecum]] at an abnormal location.

It is usually discovered near birth, but in some cases is not discovered until adulthood.<ref name="pmid12394439">{{cite journal |author=Dietz DW, Walsh RM, Grundfest-Broniatowski S, Lavery IC, Fazio VW, Vogt DP |title=Intestinal malrotation: a rare but important cause of bowel obstruction in adults |journal=Dis.

==Treatment==
Treatment is possible and these are the steps taken:
Resuscitate the patient with fluids to stabilize them before surgically
* correcting the malrotation (counterclockwise rotation of the bowel)
* cutting the fibrous bands over the [[duodenum]].
* widening the mesenteric pedicle by separation of the duodenum and cecum

With this condition the appendix is often on the wrong side of the body and therefore removed as a precautionary measure during the surgical procedure.

One surgical technique is known as "Ladd's procedure", after Dr. William Ladd.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ladd WE |title=Surgical Diseases of the Alimentary Tract in Infants |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=215 |pages=705–8 |year=1936 |doi=10.1056/NEJM193610152151604 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM193610152151604}}</ref><ref name="pmid9498402">{{cite journal |author=Bass KD, Rothenberg SS, Chang JH |title=Laparoscopic Ladd's procedure in infants with malrotation |journal=J.

Long term research on the Ladd procedure shows that even after the procedure, patients are susceptible to have complaints and might need further surgery.
