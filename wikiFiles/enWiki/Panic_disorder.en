'''Panic disorder''' is an [[anxiety disorder]] characterized by recurring severe [[panic attack]]s. It may also include significant behavioral changes lasting at least a month and of ongoing worry about the implications or concern about having other attacks. The latter are called ''anticipatory attacks'' (DSM-IVR). Panic disorder is not the same as [[agoraphobia]] (fear of public places), although many afflicted with panic disorder also suffer from agoraphobia. Panic attacks cannot be predicted, therefore an individual may become stressed, anxious or worried wondering when the next panic attack will occur.<ref name="Barker2003">{{cite book |author=Phil Barker|title=Psychiatric and mental health nursing: the craft of caring|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6qdoQgAACAAJ&pg=PA215|accessdate=4 December 2010|date=7 October 2003|publisher=Arnold|isbn=978-0-340-81026-2|pages=215–}}</ref> Panic disorder may be differentiated as a medical condition, or [[chemical imbalance]]. The DSM-IV-TR describes panic disorder and anxiety differently. Whereas anxiety is preceded by chronic [[stressor]]s which build to reactions of moderate intensity that can last for days, weeks or months, panic attacks are acute events triggered by a sudden, out-of-the-blue cause: duration is short and symptoms are more intense.<ref>http://panicdisorder.about.com/od/understandingpanic/a/anxvspanic.htm</ref> Panic attacks can occur in children, as well as adults. Panic in young people may be particularly distressing because children tend to have less insight about what is happening, and parents are also likely to experience distress when attacks occur.

Screening tools like [[Panic Disorder Severity Scale]] can be used to detect possible cases of disorder, and suggest the need for a formal diagnostic assessment.<ref>Houck, P. R., Spiegel, D. A., Shear, M. K. & Rucci, P. (2002). Reliability of the self-report version of the Panic DisorderSeverity Scale. Depression and Anxiety,15(4): 183-185.</ref><ref>Shear, M. K., Rucci, P., Williams, J., Frank, E., Grochocinski, V., Vander Bilt, J., Houck, P. & Wang, T. (2001). Reliability and validity of the Panic Disorder: Replication and extension. Journal of Psychiatric Research, 35(2): 293-296.</ref>

Panic disorder is a potentially disabling disorder, but can be controlled and successfully treated. Because of the intense symptoms that accompany panic disorder, it may be mistaken for a life-threatening physical illness such as a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. This misconception often aggravates or triggers future attacks (some are called "anticipatory attacks"). People frequently go to hospital [[emergency room]]s on experiencing a panic attack, and extensive medical tests may be performed to rule out other conditions, thus creating further anxiety. There are three types of panic attacks: unexpected, situationally bounded, and situationally predisposed.<ref>American psychiatric association 2000</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Panic disorder sufferers usually have a series of intense episodes of extreme [[anxiety]] during [[panic attacks]]. These attacks typically last about ten minutes, and can be as short-lived as 1–5 minutes, but can last twenty minutes to more than an hour, or until helpful intervention is made. Panic attacks can wax and wane for a period of hours (panic attacks rolling into one another), and the intensity and specific symptoms of panic may vary over the duration. 

In some cases the attack may continue at unabated high intensity, or seem to be increasing in severity. Common symptoms of an attack include [[Tachycardia|rapid heartbeat]], [[Diaphoresis|perspiration]], [[dizziness]], [[dyspnea]], [[Tremor|trembling]], uncontrollable [[fear]] such as: the fear of losing control and going crazy, <ref> depression and aniexty 27:93-112, 2010.</ref> the fear of dying <ref> marquez (N.D). Panic Disorder Respiratory Subtype: Psychopathology, Laboratory Challenge Tests, and Response to Treatment.</ref>  and hyperventilation. Other symptoms are sweating, a sensation of choking, chest pain, nausea, numbness or tingling, chills or hot flashes, faintness <ref> Diler et al., (2004)Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Adolescent Panic.</ref> and some sense of altered reality.<ref name="Frisch">Frisch, N. and Frisch, L. 2006. Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing. 3rd ed. Canada: Thomson Delmar Learning.</ref> In addition, the person usually has thoughts of impending doom.<ref>Healy (2009) Psychiatric Drugs Explained</ref> Individuals suffering from an episode have often a strong wish of escaping from the situation that provoked the attack. The anxiety of Panic Disorder is particularly severe and noticeably episodic compared to that from [[Generalized anxiety disorder|Generalized Anxiety Disorder]]. There are instances when panic attacks are provoked by exposure to certain stimuli e.g. seeing a mouse. Other attacks may emanate out of nowhere or in specific settings e.g. the dentist's office.<ref name="Frisch" />  Some individuals deal with these events on a regular basis, sometimes daily or weekly. The outward symptoms of a panic attack often cause negative social experiences (e.g. embarrassment, social stigma, [[social isolation]], etc.). 

[[Limited symptom attack]]s are similar to panic attacks, but have fewer symptoms.  Most people with PD experience both panic attacks and limited symptom attacks.

==Causes==
===Psychological Models===
There is no single cause for panic disorder, however, panic disorder has been found to run in families, and suggests that [[heredity|inheritance]] plays a strong role in determining who will get it.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://tc.engr.wisc.edu/uer/uer97/author3/index.html| title= Panic Disorder and Pharmacological Treatment Options| accessdate=2012-05-12 }}</ref> It has also been found to exist as a co-morbid condition with many hereditary disorders, such as [[bipolar disorder]], and a genetic predisposition to [[alcoholism]]{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}. 

Psychological factors, stressful life events, life transitions, environment, and thinking in a way that exaggerates relatively normal bodily reactions are also believed to play a role in the onset of panic disorder. Often the first attacks are triggered by physical illnesses, major stress, or certain [[medication]]s. People who tend to take on excessive responsibilities may develop a tendency to suffer panic attacks. Post-traumatic stress disorder ([[PTSD]]) patients also show a much higher rate of panic disorder than the general population.

There is some evidence to suggest [[hypoglycemia]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[mitral valve prolapse]], [[labyrinthitis]], [[pheochromocytoma]] and [[Respiratory_system#Disease|respiratory conditions]] can cause or aggravate panic disorder{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}.

[[Prepulse inhibition]] has been found to be reduced in patients with Panic Disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ludewig S, Geyer MA, Ramseier M, Vollenweider FX, Rechsteiner E, Cattapan-Ludewig K |title=Information-processing deficits and cognitive dysfunction in panic disorder |journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=37–43 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15644996 |pmc=543839 }}</ref>

Many [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]]s also have stimulant side-effects during the beginning of treatment which may exacerbate the condition and have actually caused first-time panic attacks in otherwise healthy individuals being treated for depression{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}.

===Medical Model===

There are other researchers looking at some individuals with panic disorder as having a chemical imbalance within the [[limbic system]] and one of its regulatory chemicals [[GABA]]-A. The reduced production of GABA-A sends false information to the [[amygdala]] which regulates the body's "fight or flight response" mechanism and in return, produces the physiological symptoms that lead to the disorder. Clonazepam, an anticonvulsant benzodiazepine with a long half-life, has been successful in keeping the condition in check.<ref>http://www.psychweekly.com/aspx/article/articledetail.aspx?articleid=547</ref>

===Mediators and moderators of panic disorder===
Recently, researchers have begun to identify mediators and moderators of aspects of panic disorder. One such mediator is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, which mediates the relationship between panic disorder patients receiving breathing training and anxiety sensitivity; thus, breathing training affects the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in a patient’s arterial blood, which in turn lowers anxiety sensitivity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meuret AE, Rosenfield D, Hofmann SG, Suvak MK, Roth WT |title=Changes in respiration mediate changes in fear of bodily sensations in panic disorder |journal=J Psychiatr Res |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=634–41 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=18835608 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2008.08.003 |pmc=3327292 }}</ref> Another mediator is hypochondriacal concerns, which mediate the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and panic symptomatology; thus, anxiety sensitivity affects hypochondriacal concerns which, in turn, affect panic symptomatology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Berrocal C, Moreno FR, Cano J |title=Anxiety sensitivity and panic symptomology: the mediator role of hypochondriacal concerns |journal=Span J Psychol |volume=10 |issue= 1|pages=159–66 |year=2007 |pmid=17549889}}</ref>

Perceived threat control has been identified as a moderator within panic disorder, moderating the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and agoraphobia; thus, the level of perceived threat control dictates the degree to which anxiety sensitivity results in agoraphobia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=White KS, Brown TA, Somers TJ, Barlow DH |title=Avoidance behavior in panic disorder: the moderating influence of perceived control |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=147–57 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16300725 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2005.07.009 }}</ref> Another recently identified moderator of panic disorder is genetic variations in the gene coding for [[galanin]]; these genetic variations moderate the relationship between females suffering from panic disorder and the level of severity of panic disorder symptomatology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Unschuld PG, Ising M, Erhardt A, ''et al.'' |title=Polymorphisms in the galanin gene are associated with symptom-severity in female patients suffering from panic disorder |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=105 |issue=1–3 |pages=177–84 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=17573119 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2007.05.006 }}</ref>

===Dental and Spinal Block Anesthetics===

The addition of epinephrine as a vasoconstrictor to hold anesthetics in place and prolong their effectiveness in dental and spinal anesthesiology may create an adrenalin rush which can bring on a panic attack in susceptible patients.  <ref>R. Rahn and B. Ball. ''Local Anesthesia in Dentistry'', 3M ESPE AG, ESPE Platz, Seefeld, Germany, 2001, 44 pp.</ref> 

===Substance abuse===
A growing body of evidence exists that shows a link between [[substance abuse]] and panic disorder.

;Smoking

Several studies have found that [[cigarette smoking]] increases the risk of developing panic disorder with or without [[agoraphobia]]<ref name="pmid16980119">{{cite journal |author=Roy-Byrne PP, Craske MG, Stein MB |title=Panic disorder |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9540 |pages=1023–32 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16980119 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69418-X }}</ref><ref name="pmid19961810">{{cite journal |author=Cosci F, Knuts IJ, Abrams K, Griez EJ, Schruers KR |title=Cigarette smoking and panic: a critical review of the literature |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=606–15 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=19961810 |doi=10.4088/JCP.08r04523blu }}</ref> and [[panic attack]]s; smoking started in adolescense or early adulthood particularly increases this risk of developing panic disorder.<ref name=Johnson00>{{cite journal |author=Johnson JG, Cohen P, Pine DS, Klein DF, Kasen S, Brook JS |title=Association between cigarette smoking and anxiety disorders during adolescence and early adulthood |journal=JAMA |volume=284 |issue=18 |pages=2348–51 |year=2000 |month=November |pmid=11066185 |doi=10.1001/jama.284.18.2348}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Isensee B, Wittchen HU, Stein MB, Höfler M, Lieb R |title=Smoking increases the risk of panic: findings from a prospective community study |journal=Arch.

Smoking cigarettes may lead to panic attacks by causing changes in [[respiratory system|respiratory]] function (e.g. feeling short of breath).

It is also possible that panic disorder patients smoke cigarettes as a form of self-medication to lessen anxiety. Nicotine and other psychoactive compounds with antidepressant properties in tobacco smoke which act as [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s in the brain can alter mood and have a calming effect, depending on dose.

;Caffeine

A number of clinical studies have shown a positive association between [[caffeine]] ingestion and panic disorder and/or [[anxiogenic]] effects.<ref name="Hughes_1996">{{cite journal | author = Hughes RN | title = Drugs Which Induce Anxiety: Caffeine | journal = New Zealand Journal of Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–42 | year = 1996 | month = June | pmid = 12204388 | doi = 10.1016/S0278-6915(02)00096-0| url = http://www.psychology.org.nz/cms_show_download.php?id=766 }}</ref><ref name="pmid21797659">{{cite journal | author = Vilarim MM, Rocha Araujo DM, Nardi AE | title = Caffeine challenge test and panic disorder: a systematic literature review | journal = Expert Rev Neurother | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 1185–95 | year = 2011 | month = August | pmid = 21797659 | doi = 10.1586/ern.11.83 | url = }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21797659 | doi=10.1586/ern.11.83 | title = Caffeine challenge test and panic disorder: A systematic literature review | year = 2011 | last1 = Vilarim | first1 = Marina Machado | last2 = Rocha Araujo | first2 = Daniele Marano | last3 = Nardi | first3 = Antonio Egidio | journal = Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 1185–95}}</ref>

;Alcohol and sedatives

About 30% of people with panic disorder use [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and 17% use other psychoactive drugs.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nmha.org/go/panic-disorder| title=Panic Disorder| publisher=Mental Health America| accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> This is in comparison with 61% (alcohol)[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm] and 7.9% (other psychoactive drugs) [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/druguse.htm] of the general population who use alcohol and psychoactive drugs, respectively.  Utilization of recreational drugs or alcohol generally make symptoms worse.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with panic disorder.

Deacon and Valentiner (2000)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deacon BJ, Valentiner DP |title=Substance use and non-clinical panic attacks in a young adult sample |journal=J Subst Abuse |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=7–15 |year=2000 |pmid=10756510 |doi=10.1016/S0899-3289(99)00017-6 }}</ref> conducted a study that examined co-morbid panic attacks and substance use in a non-clinical sample of young adults who experienced regular panic attacks.

If panic disorder patients are indeed self-medicating, there may be a portion of the population with undiagnosed panic disorder who will not seek professional help as a result of their own self-medication. In fact, for some patients panic disorder is only diagnosed after they seek treatment for their self-medication habit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cox BJ, Norton GR, Swinson RP, Endler NS |title=Substance abuse and panic-related anxiety: a critical review |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=385–93 |year=1990 |pmid=2256896 |doi=10.1016/0005-7967(90)90157-E }}</ref>

While [[ethanol|alcohol]] initially helps ease panic disorder symptoms, medium- or long-term alcohol abuse can cause panic disorder to develop or worsen during [[alcohol intoxication]], especially during [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome]].<ref name="pmid15361983">{{cite journal |author=Terra MB, Figueira I, Barros HM |title=Impact of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal syndrome on social phobia and panic disorder in alcoholic inpatients |journal=Rev Hosp Clin Fac Med Sao Paulo |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=187–92 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15361983 |doi=10.1590/S0041-87812004000400006 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0041-87812004000400006&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en }}</ref> This effect is not unique to alcohol but can also occur with long term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the [[benzodiazepines]] which are sometimes prescribed as tranquilizers to people with alcohol problems.<ref name="pmid15361983" /> The reason chronic alcohol misuse worsens panic disorder is due to distortion of the brain chemistry and function.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wetterling T |coauthors=Junghanns K |date=|year=2000 |month=Dec |title=Psychopathology of alcoholics during withdrawal and early abstinence|journal=Eur Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=483–8 |pmid=11175926 |doi=10.1016/S0924-9338(00)00519-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Cowley DS |year=1992 |month=Jan |date=24 |title=Alcohol abuse, substance abuse, and panic disorder|journal=Am J Med |volume=92 |issue=1A |pages=41S–8S |pmid=1346485 |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(92)90136-Y}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Cosci F |coauthors=Schruers KR, Abrams K, Griez EJ |date=|year=2007 |month=Jun |title=Alcohol use disorders and panic disorder: a review of the evidence of a direct relationship|journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=874–80 |pmid=17592911 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v68n0608}}</ref>

Approximately 10% of patients will experience notable protracted withdrawal symptoms, which can include panic disorder, after discontinuation of benzodiazepines. Protracted withdrawal symptoms tend to resemble those seen during the first couple of months of withdrawal but usually are of a subacute level of severity compared to the symptoms seen during the first 2 or 3 months of withdrawal. It is not known definitively whether such symptoms persisting long after withdrawal are related to true pharmacological withdrawal or whether they are due to structural [[neuronal]] damage as result of chronic use of benzodiazepines or withdrawal. Nevertheless such symptoms do typically lessen as the months and years go by eventually disappearing altogether.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=J Subst Abuse Treat | year =1991 | volume=8 | issue=1–2 | pages=19–28 | title=Protracted withdrawal syndromes from benzodiazepines | author=Ashton H |pmid=1675688 |url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashpws.htm |publisher=benzo.org.uk | doi=10.1016/0740-5472(91)90023-4 }}</ref>

A significant proportion of patients attending mental health services for conditions including [[anxiety disorder]]s such as panic disorder or [[social anxiety|social phobia]] have developed these conditions as a result of alcohol or [[sedative]] abuse. Anxiety may pre-exist alcohol or sedative independence, which then acts to perpetuate or worsen the underlying anxiety disorder. Someone suffering the toxic effects of alcohol abuse or chronic sedative use or abuse will not benefit from other therapies or medications for underlying psychiatric conditions. as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms.

==Diagnosis==
The [[DSM-IV-TR]] diagnostic criteria for panic disorder require unexpected, recurrent panic attacks, followed in at least one instance by at least a month of a significant and related behavior change, a persistent concern of more attacks, or a worry about the attack's consequences. There are two types, one with and one without agoraphobia. Diagnosis is excluded by attacks due to a drug or medical condition, or by panic attacks that are better accounted for by other mental disorders.<ref>{{vcite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |ref=DSM-IV-TR |publisher=<!-- pacify Citation bot --> |location=<!-- pacify Citation bot --> |chapter=Panic Disorder without Agoraphobia |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/pncdiswoaphob.htm }} {{vcite book |chapter=Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/pncdiswaphob.htm }}</ref>

In addition, people with panic disorder may need treatment for other emotional problems. [[Comorbid]] [[clinical depression]], [[personality disorders]] and [[alcohol abuse]] are known risk factors for treatment failure.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Seguí | first1 = J. | last2 = Márquez | first2 = M. | last3 = Canet | first3 = J. | last4 = García | first4 = L. | title = [Causes of failure in psychopharmacological treatment of anxiety disorder] | journal = Actas Esp Psiquiatr | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 250–8 | month =  | year =  1999| doi =  | pmid = 10469946 }}</ref>

As with many disorders, having a support structure of family and friends who understand the condition can help increase the rate of recovery. During an attack, it is not uncommon for the sufferer to develop irrational, immediate fear, which can often be dispelled by a supporter who is familiar with the condition. For more serious or active treatment, there are support groups for anxiety sufferers which can help people understand and deal with the disorder.

Current treatment guidelines [[American Psychiatric Association]] and the [[American Medical Association]] primarily recommend either cognitive-behavioral therapy or one of a variety of psychopharmacological interventions.  Some evidence exists supporting the superiority of combined treatment approaches.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barlow DH, Gorman JM, Shear MK, Woods SW |title=Cognitive-behavioral therapy, [[imipramine]], or their combination for panic disorder: A randomized controlled trial |journal=JAMA |volume=283 |issue=19 |pages=2529–36 |year=2000 |month=May |pmid=10815116 |doi=10.1001/jama.283.19.2529 }}</ref><ref name=Marks93>{{cite journal |author=Marks IM, Swinson RP, Başoğlu M, ''et al.'' |title=Alprazolam and exposure alone and combined in panic disorder with agoraphobia.

===Psychotherapy===
Panic Disorder is not the same as phobic symptoms, although phobias commonly result from panic disorder.<ref>{{vcite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |ref=DSM-IV-TR |publisher=<!-- pacify Citation bot -->}}</ref>  [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]] and one tested form of [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] have been shown efficacious in treating panic disorder with and without agoraphobia.<ref name=Marks93/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Milrod BL, Leon AC, Barber JP, Markowitz JC, Graf E |title=Do comorbid personality disorders moderate panic-focused psychotherapy?

Clinically, a combination of psychotherapy and medication can often produce good results, although research evidence of this approach has been less robust. Some improvement may be noticed in a fairly short period of time — about 6 to 8 weeks. Psychotherapy can improve the effectiveness of medication, reduce the likelihood of relapse for someone who has discontinued medication, and offer help for people with panic disorder who do not respond at all to medication.<ref name="Choy">{{cite journal |author=Choy Y |title=Treatment Planning for Panic Disorder |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=25 |issue=2 |date=February 1, 2008 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/panic-disorder/article/10168/1147676}}</ref>

The goal of cognitive behavior therapy is to help a patient reorganize thinking processes and anxious thoughts regarding an experience that provokes panic. An approach that proved successful for 87% of patients in a controlled trial is '''interoceptive therapy''', which simulates the symptoms of panic to allow patients to experience them in a controlled environment.<ref name="Choy"/>

Symptom inductions generally occur for ''one minute'' and may include:

*Intentional hyperventilation – creates [[lightheadedness]], [[derealization]], blurred vision, [[dizziness]]
*Spinning in a chair – creates [[dizziness]], [[disorientation]]
*Straw breathing – creates [[dyspnea]], airway constriction
*Breath holding – creates sensation of being out of [[breath]]
*Running in place – creates increased [[heart rate]], [[Respiratory system|respiration]], [[perspiration]]
*Body tensing – creates feelings of being tense and vigilant

The key to the induction is that the exercises should mimic the most frightening symptoms of a panic attack.  Symptom inductions should be repeated three to five times per day until the patient has little to no anxiety in relation to the symptoms that were induced.  Often it will take a period of weeks for the afflicted to feel no anxiety in relation to the induced symptoms.  With repeated trials, a person learns through experience that these internal sensations do not need to be feared and becomes less sensitized or desensitized to the internal sensation.  After repeated trials, when nothing catastrophic happens, the brain learns ([[hippocampus]] & [[amygdala]]) to not fear the sensations, and the [[sympathetic nervous system]] activation fades.

For patients whose panic disorder involves [[agoraphobia]], the traditional cognitive therapy approach has been in vivo exposure, in which the affected individual, accompanied by a therapist, is gradually exposed to the actual situation that provokes panic.<ref name="Choy"/>

Another form of psychotherapy which has shown effectiveness in controlled clinical trials is panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy, which focuses on the role of dependency, separation anxiety, and anger in causing panic disorder. The underlying theory posits that due to biochemical vulnerability, traumatic early experiences, or both, people with panic disorder have a fearful dependence on others for their sense of security, which leads to separation anxiety and defensive anger. Therapy involves first exploring the stressors that lead to panic episodes, then probing the psychodynamics of the conflicts underlying panic disorder and the defense mechanisms that contribute to the attacks, with attention to transference and separation anxiety issues implicated in the therapist-patient relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Busch FN and Milrod BL |title=Panic-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy|journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=25 |issue=2 |date=February 1, 2008 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychotherapy/article/10168/1147526}}</ref>

Comparative clinical studies suggest that muscle relaxation techniques and breathing exercises are not efficacious in reducing panic attacks.<ref name="Choy"/> In fact, breathing exercises may actually increase the risk of relapse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmidt NB, Woolaway-Bickel K, Trakowski J ''et al.'' |title=Dismantling cognitive-behavioral treatment for panic disorder: questioning the utility of breathing retraining |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol|volume=68 |pages=417–424 |year=2000 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&uid=2000-15699-006 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.68.3.417 |pmid=10883558 |issue=3}}</ref>

vanApeldoorn, F.J. et al. (2011) demonstrated the additive value of a combined treatment incorporating an SSRI treatment intervention with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT).   <ref>{{cite journal | author = van Apeldoorn F.J., van Hout W.J.P.J., Mersch P.P.A., Huisman M., Slaap B.R., Hale W.W.III, den Boer J.A. | year = 2008 | title = Is a combined therapy more effective than either CBT or SSRI alone?

(2011) went on to examine the role of the therapist in CBT.

The findings indicated that the first group had a somewhat better response rate, but that both groups demonstrated a significant improvement in reduction of panic symptomatology.  These findings lend credibility to the application of CBT programs to patients who are unable to access therapeutic services due to financial, or geographic inaccessibility. <ref>{{cite journal | author = Gloster A.T., Wittchen H-U, Lang T., Helbig-Lang S., Fydrich T., Fehm L., Volker A. | year = 2011 | title = Psychological treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia:  A randomized controlled trial to examine the role of therapist-guided exposure in situ in CBT | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = 3| pages = 406–420 | doi = 10.1037/a0023584 | pmid = 21534651 }}</ref>  Koszycky et al.

===Medication===
Appropriate medications are effective for panic disorder. [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] are first line treatments rather than [[benzodiazapines]] due to concerns with the latter regarding tolerance, dependence and abuse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moylan S, Giorlando F, Nordfjærn T, Berk M |title=The role of alprazolam for the treatment of panic disorder in Australia |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=212–24 |year=2012 |month=March |pmid=22391278 |doi=10.1177/0004867411432074|url=}}</ref> Although there is little evidence that pharmacological interventions can directly alter phobias, few studies have been performed, and medication treatment of panic makes phobia treatment far easier.  Medications can include:
* [[Antidepressant]]s ([[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]]s, [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitors|MAOI]]s, [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s and [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s)  : these are taken regularly every day, and alter neurotransmitter configurations which in turn can help to block symptoms.  Although these medications are described as "antidepressants", nearly all of them — especially the tricyclic antidepressants — have anti-anxiety properties, in part, due to their sedative effects. SSRIs have been known to exacerbate symptoms in panic disorder patients, especially in the beginning of treatment and have even provoked panic attacks in otherwise healthy individuals.  SSRIs are also known to produce [[SSRI discontinuation syndrome|withdrawal symptoms]] which include rebound anxiety and panic attacks.  Comorbid [[major depression|depression]] has been cited as imparting the worst course, leading to chronic, disabling illness.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roy-Byrne PP, Stang P, Wittchen HU, Ustun B, Walters EE, Kessler RC |title=Lifetime panic-depression comorbidity in the National Comorbidity Survey.

* [[Anti-anxiety drug]]s ([[benzodiazepine]]s): Use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder is controversial with opinion differing in the medical literature. The [[American Psychiatric Association]] states that benzodiazepines can be effective for the treatment of panic disorder and recommends that the choice of whether to use benzodiazepines, antidepressants with antipanic properties or psychotherapy should be based on the individual patient's history and characteristics. They reported that in their view there is insufficient evidence to recommend one treatment over another for panic disorder. The APA noted that while benzodiazepines have the advantage of a rapid onset of action, that this is offset by the risk of developing a [[benzodiazepine dependence]].<ref name="APA">{{cite web |url=http://www.psychiatryonline.com/pracGuide/loadGuidelinePdf.aspx?file=PanicDisorder_2e_PracticeGuideline |format=PDF |title= APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Panic Disorder, Second Edition |author=Work Group on Panic Disorder |date = January 2009|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> The [[National Institute of Clinical Excellence]] came to a different conclusion, they pointed out the problems of using uncontrolled clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and based on placebo controlled research they concluded that benzodiazepines were not effective in the long-term for panic disorder and recommended that benzodiazepines not be used for longer than 4 weeks for panic disorder.

Panic disorder is a serious health problem that in many cases can be successfully treated, although there is no known cure.  It typically strikes during early adulthood; roughly half of all people who have panic disorder develop the condition before age 24, especially those subjected to traumatic experiences.  However, some sources say that the majority of young people affected for the first time are between the ages of 25 and 30. Women are twice as likely as men to develop panic disorder.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/panicfacts.cfm| title= Facts about Panic Disorder| publisher=National Institute of Mental Health| accessdate=2006-09-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060907014356/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/panicfacts.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-09-07}}</ref>

Panic disorder can continue for months or years, depending on how and when treatment is sought.  If left untreated, it may worsen to the point where one's life is seriously affected by panic attacks and by attempts to avoid or conceal the condition.  In fact, many people have had problems with personal relationships or employment while struggling to cope with panic disorder.  Some people with panic disorder may conceal their condition because of the stigma of mental illness.  In some individuals, symptoms may occur frequently for a period of months or years, then many years may pass without symptoms.  In some cases, the symptoms persist at the same level indefinitely.  There is also some evidence that many individuals (especially those who develop symptoms at an early age) may experience symptom cessation later in life (e.g. past age 50).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In 2000, the [[World Health Organization]] found prevalence and incidence rates for panic disorder to be very similar across the globe. Age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 309 in Africa to 330 in East Asia for men and from 613 in Africa to 649 in North America, Oceania, and Europe for women.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global burden of panic disorder in the year 2000|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/bod_panicdisorder.pdf|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|last=Ayuso-Mateos|first=Jose Luis|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}</ref>

Children differ from adolescents and adults in their interpretation and ability to express their experience.  Like adults, children experience physical symptoms including accelerated heart rate, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, nausea or stomach pain, dizziness or light-headedness.  In addition children also experience cognitive symptoms like fear of dying, feelings of being detached from oneself, feelings of losing control or going crazy, but they are unable to vocalize these higher order manifestations of fear.  They simply know that something is going wrong and that they are very afraid. Children can only describe the physical symptoms. They have not yet developed the constructs to put these symptoms together and label them as fear. Parents often feel helpless when they watch a child suffer.  They can help children give a name to their experience, and empower them to overcome the fear they are experiencing<ref>Beidel D.C., & Alfano, C.A. (2011)  Child Anxiety Disorders:  A Guide to Research and Treatment.  (2nd Ed.)  Routledge Taylor & Frances Group, New York, U.S.A.</ref>

The role of the parent in treatment and intervention for children diagnosed with panic disorder is discussed by McKay & Starch (2011).  They point out that there are several levels at which parental involvement should be considered.  The first involves the initial assessment.  Parents as well as the child should be screened for attitudes and treatment goals, as well as for levels of anxiety or conflict in the home.  The second involves the treatment process in which the therapist should meet with the family as a unit as frequently as possible.  Ideally all family members should be aware and trained in the process of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in order to encourage the child to rationalize and face fears rather than employ avoidant safety behaviours.  McKay & Storch (2011) suggest training/modeling of therapeutic techniques and in session involvement of the parents in the treatment of children to enhance treatment efficacy.<ref>Lewin, A.B.

Despite the evidence pointing to the existence of early-onset panic disorder, the [[DSM-IV-TR]] currently only recognizes six anxiety disorders in children: [[separation anxiety disorder]], generalized anxiety disorder, [[specific phobia]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[social anxiety disorder]] (a.k.a. social phobia), and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Panic disorder is notably excluded from this list.
