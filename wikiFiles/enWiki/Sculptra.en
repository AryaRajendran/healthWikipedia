'''Sculptra''', or poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), is an [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved [[dermal]] filler manufactured by Dermik Pharmaceuticals, which conducts the North American business of Aventis Dermatology, the global dermatology unit of [[Aventis]] (of [[Sanofi-Aventis]]). 

PLLA was approved by the FDA on August 3, 2004, for the treatment of facial [[fat]] loss (also called facial [[lipoatrophy]]). It continues to be studied for this use. Facial lipoatrophy is a condition in which people lose fat in their faces, especially in their cheeks and around their eyes and temples. People with [[HIV]] who take anti-HIV drugs may develop lipoatrophy.

PLLA is [[Injection (medicine)|injected]] into the skin in areas where fat has been lost. It causes the skin to thicken via collagen neo-synthesis, improves appearance of folds and sunken areas, and hides the fat loss. For most people who participated in PLLA clinical studies, the effects of treatment lasted for two years.

The original side effects of Sculptra injections included the delayed appearance of small bumps under the skin in the treated area. Generally these bumps are not visible and were noticed when pressing on the treated area. Other side effects included  [[bleeding]], tenderness or discomfort, redness, [[bruising]], or [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]].  The newer technique of injecting more dilute Sculptra has reduced the incidence of palpable "bumps" to 1% or less.

PLLA is primarily used by [[dermatologist]]s as a volume filler for lipoatrophy of cheeks in thin fit women or men who have lost facial fat. It has been called a "liquid facelift" because adding volume to the malar and cheek areas lifts sagging areas of the atrophic face.
