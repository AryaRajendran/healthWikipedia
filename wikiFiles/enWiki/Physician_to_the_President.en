The '''Physician to the President''' (also known colloquially as the '''White House doctor''') is the formal and official title of the [[physician]] who is director of the [[White House Medical Unit]], a unit of the [[White House Military Office]] responsible for the medical needs of the [[President of the United States]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[White House]] staff, and visitors.<ref name=Parade>[http://www.parade.com/health/2009/08/16-when-the-patient-is-the-president.html Mishori, Ranit.

==History==
Doctors who have treated the President of the United States have had a variety of titles.<ref name="Deppisch4">Deppisch, p. 4.</ref> Dr. [[Presley Marion Rixey]], a Medical Inspector in the [[United States Navy]], was the first individual to serve in a full-time capacity as physician to the President beginning in 1901, although the title "White House Physician" was not used until created by an act of Congress in 1928.<ref>Deppisch, p. 4, 75.</ref>

==Organization and role==
The White House doctor has an office inside the White House. The location of his or her medical unit plays an important role in keeping the President of the United States healthy. He or she also oversees a staff which is typically composed of five military physicians, five [[nurse]]s, five [[physician assistant]]s, three [[medic]]s, three administrators and one IT Manager. The White House Physician is [[metaphor]]ically the "[[shadow]] of the President"<ref name=CNN/> because he or she is always close at hand whether the President is at the White House, overseas, on the campaign trail, or aboard presidential plane [[Air Force One]].<ref name=CNN/> The Physician to the President protects the president's health and may also perform emergency surgery.

The White House doctor is also responsible for providing comprehensive medical care to the members of the president's immediate family, the Vice President, and the Vice President's family. He or she may also provide medical care and attention to the more than 1.5 million visitors who tour the White House each year, as well as to international dignitaries and other guests of the President.

The medical office of the White House doctor is a "mini urgent-care center" containing a physician's office, private examination rooms, basic medications and medical supplies, and a [[crash cart]] for emergency resuscitation.  Air Force One is equipped with emergency medical equipment, an [[operating table]], and [[operating room]] lights installed at the center of the presidential plane for emergency use by the White House doctor,<ref name=CNN/> but does not have an [[X-ray generator|X-ray machine]] or medical laboratory equipment.<ref name="Battalion" />

The position is not necessarily glamorous. Daniel Ruge, [[Ronald Reagan]]'s first physician in the White House, resigned after the president's first term and called his job "vastly overrated, boring and not medically challenging." Ruge could not attend most [[State dinner#United States|state dinners]] due to lack of space. He nonetheless had to be ready for emergencies, and usually waited alone in his office wearing a [[tuxedo]]. Ruge stated that an advantage, however, was that because of the position's prestige "[a] president's physician can ask for anything, and he will get it. No doctor will refuse a request to consult."{{r|altman20050906}}

===Selection of the physician===
The White House Physician is often selected personally by the President, and most White House doctors are active-duty [[Medical Corps|military officers]],<ref name=CNN>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/HEALTH/09/23/wh.doctors/ "White House Doctors: The President's Shadow."] [[CNN|CNN.com]]. September 24, 2004. Accessed 2010-05-12.</ref> in part because most civilians would find closing then reopening their private practices difficult.{{r|altman20050906}}

As of May 2010, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Jeffrey Kuhlman, MD, USN, is the incumbent White House doctor.<ref name=Parade/><ref name="POTUSExam">[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/potus_med_exam_feb2010.pdf Kuhlman, Jeffrey.
