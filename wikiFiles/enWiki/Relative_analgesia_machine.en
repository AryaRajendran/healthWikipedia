A '''relative analgesia machine''' is used by [[dentist]]s to induce inhalation [[sedation]] in their patients. It delivers a mixture of [[nitrous oxide]] (laughing gas) and [[oxygen]]. A relative analgesia machine is simpler than an [[anaesthetic machine]], as it does not feature the additional [[medical ventilator]] and [[anaesthetic vaporiser]], which are only needed for administration of [[general anesthetic]]s. Instead the relative analgesia machine is designed for the light form of [[anaesthesia]] with nitrous oxide, where the patient is less sensitive to pain but remains fully conscious.<ref name=Dentalfear>{{cite web|url=http://www.dentalfearcentral.org/laughing_gas.html|author=Dental Fear Central|title=Inhalation sedation (aka Laughing Gas)|year=2004|accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref>
