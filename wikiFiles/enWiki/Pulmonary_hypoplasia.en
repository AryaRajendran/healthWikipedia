'''Pulmonary hypoplasia''' is incomplete development of the [[lung]]s, resulting in an abnormally low number or size of [[bronchopulmonary segment]]s or [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]].  A [[congenital malformation]], it most often occurs secondary to other [[Fetus|fetal]] abnormalities that interfere with normal development of the lungs.  Primary ([[idiopathic]]) pulmonary hypoplasia is rare and usually not associated with other maternal or fetal abnormalities.

Incidence of pulmonary hypoplasia ranges from 9–11 per 10,000 [[live birth (human)|live birth]]s and 14 per 10,000 births.<ref name=Cadichon/>  Pulmonary hypoplasia is a common cause of [[neonatal death]].<ref name="pmid15251146">{{cite journal

Pulmonary hypoplasia is associated with [[oligohydramnios]] through multiple mechanisms. Both conditions can result from blockage of the [[urinary bladder]].  Blockage prevents the bladder from emptying, and the bladder becomes very large and full.  The large volume of the full bladder interferes with normal development of other organs, including the lungs.  Pressure within the bladder becomes abnormally high, causing abnormal function in the kidneys hence abnormally high pressure in the vascular system entering the kidneys.  This high pressure also interferes with normal development of other organs.  An experiment in rabbits showed that PH also can be caused directly by oligohydramnios.<ref name="pmid9240585">{{cite journal

Pulmonary hypoplasia is diagnosed also clinically.

==Management==
Management has three components:  interventions before delivery, timing and place of delivery, and therapy after delivery.

In some cases, [[fetal therapy]] is available for the underlying condition;  this may help to limit the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia.  In exceptional cases, fetal therapy may include [[fetal surgery]].<ref name="pmid12475547">{{cite journal

A 1992 case report of a baby with a sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) reported that the SCT had obstructed the outlet of the urinary bladder causing the bladder to rupture in utero and fill the baby's abdomen with urine (a form of [[ascites]]).  The outcome was good.  The baby had normal kidneys and lungs, leading the authors to conclude that obstruction occurred late in the pregnancy and to suggest that the rupture may have protected the baby from the usual complications of such an obstruction.<ref name="pmid1491908">{{cite journal

Often, a baby with a high risk of pulmonary hypoplasia will have a planned delivery in a specialty hospital such as (in the [[United States]]) a [[tertiary referral hospital]] with a level 3 [[neonatal intensive-care unit]].  The baby may require immediate advanced resuscitation and therapy.<ref>{{cite book

Early delivery may be required in order to rescue the fetus from an underlying condition that is causing pulmonary hypoplasia.  However, pulmonary hypoplasia increases the risks associated with [[preterm birth]], because once delivered the baby requires adequate lung capacity to sustain life.  The decision whether to deliver early includes a careful assessment of the extent to which delaying delivery may increase or decrease the pulmonary hypoplasia.  It is a choice between [[expectant management]] and [[active management]].    An example is [[congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation]] with [[hydrops fetalis|hydrops]];  impending heart failure may require a preterm delivery.<ref name="pmid11111218">{{cite journal
