'''Orthostatic hypertension''' or '''postural hypertension''' is a medical condition consisting of a sudden [[hypertension|increase in blood pressure]] when a person stands up.<ref name="fessel">{{cite doi|10.1038/ncpneph0228}}</ref> Orthostatic hypertension is diagnosed by a rise in [[systole (medicine)|systolic]] blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more when standing. ''Orthostatic diastolic hypertension'' is a condition in which the [[diastolic]] raises to 98 mmHg or over in response to standing;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=David S.|date=May 2000|title=Orthostatic Intolerance (OI) Test Results|journal=Lyndonville News|volume=2|issue=3|url=http://www.oiresource.com/tresults.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Streeten|first=D.H.P.|title=Orthostatic Disorders of the Circulation|year=1987|publisher=Plenum Medical|location=New York|page=116}}</ref> however, this definition currently lacks clear medical consensus, and is thus subject to change. Orthostatic hypertension involving the systolic is known as ''systolic orthostatic hypertension''. 

Orthostatic hypertension if affecting an individual's ability to remain upright, is viewed as a form of [[orthostatic intolerance]]. The body's inability to regulate the blood pressure can be a type of [[dysautonomia]].

Baroreflex and autonomic pathways normally ensure that blood pressure is maintained despite various stimuli including postural change.  The precise mechanism of orthostatic hypertension though remains unclear but it is thought that alpha-adrenergic activity may be the predominant pathophysiologic mechanism of orthostatic hypertension in elderly hypertensive patients.<ref name="ucurve">{{cite pmid|12103267}}</ref> Other mechanisms are proposed for other different groups of individuals with this disorder.<ref name="fessel"/>

A prevalence of 1.1% was found in a large population study.<ref>{{cite pmid|18712045}}</ref> The risk of orthostatic hypertension has been found to increase with age, with it being found in 16.3% of older, hypertensive patients.<ref name="fan">{{cite PMID|21418863}}</ref>

Dr. David H.P. Streeten is the discoverer of orthostatic hypertension.<ref>{{cite pmid| 11157991}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
* Mild or moderate orthostatic hypertension may present without any symptoms other than the orthostatic hypertension BP findings.  More severe orthostatic hypertension may present with the typical symptoms of hypertension.
* Orthostatic venous pooling is common with orthostatic diastolic hypertension. This occurs in the legs while standing.<ref>{{cite PMID|3980066}}</ref><ref>{{cite PMID|3343547}}</ref> 
* [[Hypovolemia]] (decreased blood volume)

==Connections to other disorders==
* [[Essential hypertension]]
* Other kinds of dysautonomia may coexist, e.g.[[postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome]] is common with this condition, [[orthostatic hypotension]] with the BP going both high and low at times due to autonomic dysfunction
* [[Type 2 diabetes]]<ref name="fessel"/>
* Vascular adrenergic hypersensitivity: Orthostatic hypertension can be secondary to this<ref>{{cite pmid|8675262}}</ref>
* [[Hypovolemia]] can cause orthostatic hypertension
* Renal arterial [[stenosis]] (narrowing of the kidney arteries) with [[nephroptosis]] (kidney drops on standing) have been known to cause orthostatic hypertension.<ref>{{cite pmid|2977192}}</ref>
* [[Aortitis]] (inflammation of the aorta) with nephroptosis: "This orthostatic hypertension largely may be due to an activation of the renin system caused by nephroptosis and partly due to a reduced baroreflex sensitivity caused by aortitis"<ref>{{cite pmid|6362595}}</ref>

==Treatments==
There is not any official recommended treatments currently for orthostatic hypertension as the condition is still little known and can be due to different causes, hence treatment for those with this disorder is still trial and error experimental treatment.
Some treatments which have been successfully used for this condition are medications [[doxazosin]],<ref>{{cite pmid|21918522}}</ref> [[carvedilol]],<ref>{{cite pmid|10770258}}</ref> [[captopril]], and [[propranolol hydrochloride]].  Treatment of coexisting conditions e.g. [[hypovolemia]]. Some specialists in severe cases give saline IVs for the hypovolemia which then if that is the cause, brings the orthostatic hypertension down to a safe level.  Pressure garments over the pelvis and the lower extremeties may be used as part of treatment, due to the blood pooling issue happening in many with the disorder. <ref>>{{cite pmid|3980066}}</ref>

==Risks==
* Blood pressure variability is associated with progression of target organ damage and cardiovascular risk.<ref>{{cite pmid|19430163}}</ref>
* Orthostatic hypertension was positively associated with [[peripheral arterial disease]].<ref name="fan"/>
* Increased occurrence of silent cerebrovascular ischemia<ref name="fessel"/><ref name="ucurve"/>
* Systolic orthostatic hypertension increases stroke risk.<ref>{{cite pmid|21199999}}</ref>
