'''Antonio Damasio''' ({{lang-pt|António Damásio}}; born February 25, 1944 in [[Lisbon]]) is a University Professor and David Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience at the [[University of Southern California]] (where he also heads the [[Brain and Creativity Institute]]), an Adjunct Professor at the [[Salk Institute]],<ref>http://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1008328&CFID=5122787&CFTOKEN=50657460</ref> and the author of several books describing his scientific thinking. "As a leading neuroscientist, Damasio has dared to speculate on neurobiological data, and has offered a theory about the relationship between human emotions, human rationality, and the underlying biology."<ref>Ole Kuhl, ''Musical Semantics'' (2008) p. 122</ref>

Prior to joining USC in 2005, Damasio was M.W. Van Allen Professor and Head of Neurology at the [[University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics]].

== Life and work ==
{{Neuropsychology}}
Damasio studied medicine at the [[University of Lisbon]] Medical School, where he also did his neurological residency and completed his doctorate. For part of his studies he researched [[behavioral neurology]] under the supervision of the [[Norman Geschwind]] of the Aphasia Research Center{{explain}} in Boston.

Damasio's main field is the [[neurobiology]] of the mind, especially neural systems which subserve{{explain|reason=somewhat puzzling use of this word}} emotion, decision-making, memory, language and consciousness.  Damasio believes that emotions play a critical role in high-level cognition&mdash;an idea counter to dominant 20th century views in psychology, neuroscience and philosophy. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}<br />
Damasio formulated the [[somatic marker hypothesis]],<ref> Damasio AR. The somatic marker hypothesis and the possible functions of the prefrontal cortex. Transactions of the Royal Society. (London). 351:1413-1420. 1996.</ref> a theory about how emotions and their biological underpinnings are involved in decision-making (both positively and negatively, and often non-consciously). Emotions provide the scaffolding for the construction of [[social cognition]] and are required for the self processes which undergird consciousness.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} "Damasio provides a contemporary scientific validation of the linkage between feelings and the body by highlighting the connection between mind and nerve cells...this personalized embodiment of mind."<ref>Lara Trout, ''The Politics of Survival'' (2010) p. 74</ref>

The somatic marker hypothesis has inspired many [[neuroscience]] experiments carried out in laboratories in the U.S. and Europe, and has had a major impact in contemporary science and philosophy.{{cn|date=October 2012}} Damasio has been named by the [[Institute of Scientific Information]] as one of the most highly cited researchers in the past decade). Current work on the biology of [[morality|moral]] decisions, [[neuro-economics]], [[social communication]], and drug-addiction, has been strongly influenced by Damasio's hypothesis.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Damasio also proposed that emotions are part of [[Homeostasis|homeostatic regulation]] and are rooted in reward/punishment mechanisms.  He recovered [[William James | James']] perspective on feelings as a read-out of body states, but expanded it with an "as-if-body-loop" device which allows for the substrate of feelings to be simulated rather than actual (foreshadowing the simulation process later uncovered by [[mirror neurons]]).  He demonstrated experimentally that the [[insular cortex]] is a critical platform for feelings, a finding that has been widely replicated, and he uncovered [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and [[wikt:subcortical|subcortical]] induction sites for human emotions, e.g. in [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] and [[amygdala]].<ref>Damasio AR, Grabowski TJ, Bechara A, Damasio H, Ponto LLB, Parvizi J, Hichwa RD. Subcortical and cortical brain activity during the feeling of self-generated emotions. Nature Neuroscience. 3:1049-1056. 2000</ref> He also demonstrated that while the insular cortex plays a major role in feelings, it is not necessary for feelings to occur, suggesting that brain stem structures play a basic role in the feeling process.<ref> Damasio A, Damasio H, Tranel D. Persistence of feelings and sentience after bilateral damage of the insula. Cerebral Cortex. 2012. doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhs077 </ref>

He has continued to investigate the neural basis of feelings and demonstrated that although the insular cortex is a major substrate for this process it is not exclusive, suggesting that brain stem nuclei are critical platforms as well.<ref> Damasio A, Damasio H, and Tranel, Cerebral Cortex, 2012 </ref> He regards feelings as the necessary foundation of sentience.

In another development, Damasio proposed that the cortical architecture on which learning and recall depend involves multiple, hierarchically organized loops of [[axon|axonal projections]] that converge on certain nodes out of which projections diverge to the points of origin of convergence (the "convergence-divergence framework").  This architecture is applicable to the understanding of [[memory]] processes and of aspects of consciousness related to the access of mental contents.<ref> Damasio AR. Time-locked multiregional retroactivation: a systems level proposal for the neural substrates of recall and recognition. Cognition. 33:25-62. 1989 </ref>

In ''The Feeling of What Happens'', Damasio laid the foundations of the "enchainment of precedences": “the nonconscious [[neural]] [[Signal transduction|signaling]] of an individual organism begets the [[protoself]] which permits [[core self]] and [[core consciousness]], which allow for an [[autobiographical self]], which permits [[extended consciousness]]. At the end of the chain, [[extended consciousness]] permits conscience.

Damasio's research depended significantly on establishing the modern [[human lesion method]], an enterprise made possible by [[Hanna Damasio]]'s structural [[neuroimaging]]/[[neuroanatomy]] work complemented by [[experimental neuroanatomy]] (with Gary Van Hoesen and Josef Parvizi), [[experimental neuropsychology]] (with Antoine Bechara, Ralph Adolphs, and Dan Tranel) and [[functional neuroimaging]] (with Kaspar Meyer, Jonas Kaplan, and Mary Helen Immordino-Yang). The experimental neuroanatomy work with Van Hoesen and Bradley Hyman led to the discovery of the disconnection of the hippocampus caused by neurofibrillary tangles in the entophinal cortex of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.<ref> Hyman B, Van Hoesen GW, Damasio A, Barnes C. Alzheimer's disease: cell-specific pathology isolates the hippocampal formation. Science. 225:1168-1170. 1984 </ref>

As a clinician, he and his collaborators have studied and treated disorders of [[behaviour]] and cognition, and [[movement disorder]]s.

Damasio's books deal with the relationship between emotions and feelings, and what their brain substrates. His 1994 book, ''[[Descartes' Error]]: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain'', won the [[Science et Vie]] prize, was a finalist for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Book Award, and is translated in over 30 languages.  It is regarded as one of the most influential books of the past two decades.<ref> In January 2010, Sciences Humaines named it one of the 20 books that changed the vision of the world. The book has been cited over 13,000 times </ref> His second book, ''The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness'', was named as one of the ten best books of 2001 by the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', a ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' Best Book of the Year, a ''[[Library Journal]]'' Best Book of the Year, and has over 30 foreign editions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Damasio's ''Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain'', was published in 2003. In it, Damasio suggested that [[Spinoza|Spinoza's]] thinking foreshadowed discoveries in biology and neuroscience views on the mind-body problem.  Spinoza was a protobiologist.  His latest book is ''Self Comes to Mind: Constructing the Conscious Brain''.  In it Damasio suggests that the self is the key to conscious minds and that feelings, from the kind he designates as primordial to the well-known feelings of emotion, are the basic elements in the construction of the protoself and core self.  The book received the Corinne International Book Prize.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Damasio is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]' [[Institute of Medicine]], and the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. He is the recipient of several prizes, amongst them the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in Science and Technology and the Beaumont Medal from the [[American Medical Association]], as well as honorary degrees from the Universities of Aachen, Copenhagen, Leiden, and numerous others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

He says he writes in the belief that "scientific knowledge can be a pillar to help humans endure and prevail."<ref>Antonio R. Damasio, ''Descartes' Error'' (New York 1994) p. 252</ref>

He is married to [[Hanna Damasio]], a collaborator and frequent co-author.
