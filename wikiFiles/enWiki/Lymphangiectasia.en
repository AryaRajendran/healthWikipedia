'''Lymphangiectasia''' is a pathologic dilation of lymph vessels.<ref name="Zachary 2007">McGavin/ Zachary (2007), Pathologic Basis of Veterinary Disease</ref> When it occurs in the [[intestine]]s of dogs, and more rarely humans, it causes a disease known as "intestinal lymphangiectasia."<ref name="Zachary 2007"/> This disease is characterized by [[lymphatic vessel]] dilation,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000954436|lymphangiectasis}}</ref> chronic [[diarrhea]] and loss of [[protein]]s such as [[serum albumin]] and [[globulin]].  It is considered to be a chronic form of [[protein-losing enteropathy]].  

It is also known as "lymphangiectasis".<ref>{{DorlandsDict|five/000061935|lymphangiectasia}}</ref>

==Cause==
[[Biopsy]] of the [[small intestine]] shows dilation of the [[lacteal]]s of the [[Intestinal villus|villi]] and distension of the [[lymphatic system|lymphatic vessel]]s.<ref>{{cite web | last = Steiner | first = Jörg M. | title = Protein-Losing Enteropathies in Dogs | work = Proceedings of the 28th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2003 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2003&PID=6588&O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-03-20 }}</ref>  Reduced [[lymphatic system|lymph]] flow leads to a [[malabsorption]] syndrome of the small intestine, especially of [[fat]] and fat-soluble [[vitamin]]s.  Rupture of the lymphatics causes protein loss into the intestines. 
 
The most common cause of lymphangiectasia was [[congenital]] malformation of the lymphatics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kull P, Hess R, Craig L, Saunders H, Washabau R |title=Clinical, clinicopathologic, radiographic, and ultrasonographic characteristics of intestinal lymphangiectasia in dogs: 17 cases (1996-1998) |journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc |volume=219 |issue=2 |pages=197–202 |year=2001 |pmid=11469575 |doi=10.2460/javma.2001.219.197}}</ref>  Secondary lymphangiectasia may be caused by [[granuloma]]s or cancer causing lymphatic obstruction, or increased [[central venous pressure]] (CVP) causing abnormal lymph drainage.  Increased CVP can be caused by [[pericarditis]] or right-sided [[heart failure]].  [[Inflammatory bowel disease]] can also lead to inflammation of the lymphatics and lymphangiectasia through migration of inflammatory cells through the lymphatics.<ref name=Fogle>{{cite journal | last = Fogle | first = Jonathan E. | coauthors = Bissett, Sally A. | title = Mucosal Immunity and Chronic Idiopathic Enteropathies in Dogs | journal = Compendium on Continuing Education for the Practicing Veterinarian | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 290–302 | publisher = Veterinary Learning Systems | month = May | year = 2007 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Chronic diarrhea is almost always seen with lymphangiectasia, but most other signs are linked to low [[blood protein]] levels ([[hypoproteinemia]]), which causes low [[oncotic pressure]].  These signs include [[ascites]], [[pleural effusion]], and [[edema]] of the limbs and trunk.  Weight loss is seen with long-term disease.<ref name=Fogle/>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is through biopsy.  The presence of hypoproteinemia, decreased blood [[lymphocyte]]s, and decreased [[cholesterol]] support the diagnosis.  [[Hypocalcaemia]] (low [[calcium]]) is also seen due to poor absorption of [[vitamin D]] and calcium, and secondary to low protein binding of calcium.  [[Medical ultrasonography]] may show [[:wikt:striation|striation]]s in the [[intestinal mucosa]] indicating dilated lacteals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sutherland-Smith J, Penninck D, Keating J, Webster C |title=Ultrasonographic intestinal hyperechoic mucosal striations in dogs are associated with lacteal dilation |journal=Vet Radiol Ultrasound |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=51–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17236361 |doi=10.1111/j.1740-8261.2007.00204.x}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment is multifactorial.  A diet very low in fat and high in high quality protein is essential.<ref>{{cite web | last = Matz | first = M.E. | title = Dietary Management of Gastrointestinal Disease | work = Proceedings of the North American Veterinary Conference | year = 2006 | url = http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/162.asp?LA=1 | accessdate = 2007-03-20 }}</ref>  Treatment of humans can also involve the use of MCT ([[medium-chain triglycerides]]) oil and/or the drug [[Octreotide]]. In dogs, fat soluble vitamins ([[vitamin A|A]], [[vitamin D|D]], [[vitamin E|E]], and [[vitamin K|K]]) should be supplemented.  [[Corticosteroid]] treatment may be required for life.  [[Antibiotic]]s can be used to treat [[bacterial overgrowth]].  With a very low [[serum albumin]], [[blood transfusion|transfusion]] with [[blood plasma]] or an infusion of [[hetastarch]] may be necessary to treat the signs until the diet can take effect.<ref>{{cite web | last = Willard | first = Michael | title = Protein-Losing Enteropathy in Dogs and Cats | work = Proceedings of the 30th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2005 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2005&PID=10987&O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-03-20 }}</ref>  Lymphangiectasia is rarely cured but can remain in [[remission (medicine)|remission]] for a long time.  It can be fatal when unresponsive to treatment.

==Affected breeds==
Breeds commonly affected by lymphangiectasia and/or protein-losing enteropathy include the [[Papillon]], [[Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier]], [[Norwegian Lundehund]], [[Basenji]], and [[Yorkshire Terrier]].<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author=Ettinger, Stephen J.;Feldman, Edward C.|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B.
