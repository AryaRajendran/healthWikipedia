'''Langerhans cell Histiocytosis''' ('''LCH''') is a rare [[disease]] involving clonal proliferation of [[Langerhans cell]]s, abnormal [[cell (biology)|cell]]s deriving from [[bone marrow]] and capable of migrating from skin to [[lymph node]]s.  Clinically, its manifestations range from isolated bone lesions to [[systemic disease|multisystem disease]].

LCH is part of a group of clinical  syndromes called [[Histiocytosis|histiocytoses]], which are characterized by an abnormal proliferation of [[histiocyte]]s (an archaic term for activated [[dendritic cell]]s and [[macrophage]]s). These diseases are related to other forms of abnormal proliferation of [[white blood cell]]s, such as [[leukemia]]s and [[lymphoma]]s. 

The disease has gone by several names, including [[Hand–Schüller–Christian disease]], '''Abt-Letterer-Siwe disease''', and '''histiocytosis X''', until it was renamed in 1985 by the [[Histiocyte Society]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)95528-5 |author= |title=Histiocytosis syndromes in children.

The disease spectrum results from [[Clone (genetics)|clonal]] accumulation and [[cell growth|proliferation]] of cells resembling the epidermal [[dendritic cell]]s called [[Langerhans cell]]s, hence sometimes called '''dendritic cell histiocytosis'''. These cells in combination with [[lymphocyte]]s, [[eosinophil]]s, and normal [[histiocyte]]s form typical LCH lesions that can be found in almost any [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Makras P, Papadogias D, Kontogeorgos G, Piaditis G, Kaltsas G |title=Spontaneous gonadotrophin deficiency recovery in an adult patient with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) |journal=Pituitary |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=169–74 |year=2005 |pmid=16379033 |doi=10.1007/s11102-005-4537-z}}</ref> A similar set of diseases has been described in [[Canine histiocytic diseases]].

LCH is clinically divided into three groups: unifocal, multifocal unisystem, and multifocal multisystem.<ref name="robbins">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; Robbins, Stanley L. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |pages=701- |isbn=0-8089-2302-1 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

;Unifocal
:Unifocal LCH, also called ''[[eosinophilic granuloma]]'' (an older term which is now known to be a [[misnomer]]), is a slowly-progressing disease characterized by an expanding proliferation of Langerhans cells in various bones. It is a monostotic or polystotic disease with no extraskeletal involvement. This differentiates eosinophilic granuloma from other forms of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (Letterer-Siwe or Hand-Schüller-Christian variant.<ref>{{See chapter 501 in Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 18th ed. Question 45 same chapter}}</ref>
;Multifocal unisystem
:Seen mostly in children, multifocal unisystem LCH is characterized by fever, bone lesions and diffuse eruptions, usually on the scalp and in the ear canals. 50% of cases involve the [[pituitary gland|pituitary stalk]], leading to [[diabetes insipidus]]. The triad of diabetes insipidus, [[exopthalmos]], and lytic bone lesions is known as the ''[[Hand-Schüller-Christian triad]]''. Peak onset is 2-10 years of age.
;Multifocal multisystem
:Multifocal multisystem LCH, also called ''[[Letterer-Siwe disease]]'', is a rapidly-progressing disease in which Langerhans cells proliferate in many tissues. It is mostly seen in children under age 2, and the prognosis is poor: even with aggressive chemotherapy, the 5-year survival is only 50%.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1100579-overview</ref>

Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) is a unique form of LCH in that it occurs almost exclusively in cigarette smokers. It is now considered a form of smoking-related [[interstitial lung disease]]. Some patients recover completely after they stop smoking, but others develop long-term complications such as [[pulmonary fibrosis]] and [[pulmonary hypertension]].

==Prevalence==
LCH usually affects children between 1 and 15 years old, with a peak incidence between 5 and 10 years of age.  Among children under the age of 10, yearly incidence is thought to be 1 in 200,000;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000068.htm |title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Histiocytosis |accessdate=2007-05-10 |work=}}</ref> and in adults even rarer, in about 1 in 560,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.histiocytosis.ca/facts.html | title=Histiocytosis Association of Canada | accessdate=2007-05-16|work=}}</ref> It has been reported in elderly but is vanishingly rare.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerlach B, Stein A, Fischer R, Wozel G, Dittert D, Richter G |title=[Langerhans cell histiocytosis in the elderly] |language=German |journal=Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift für Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=23–30 |year=1998 |pmid=9522189}}</ref> It is most prevalent in Caucasians, and affects males twice as often as females.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

LCH is usually a sporadic and non-[[hereditary]] condition but [[family|familial]] clustering has been noted in limited number of cases. [[Hashimoto-Pritzker disease]] is a congenital self-healing variant of Hand-Schüller-Christian disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kapur P, Erickson C, Rakheja D, Carder K, Hoang M |title=Congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis (Hashimoto-Pritzker disease): ten-year experience at Dallas Children's Medical Center |journal=J.

==Pathophysiology==

The pathogenesis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a matter of debate. There are ongoing investigations to determine whether LCH is a reactive or neoplastic process. Arguments supporting the reactive nature of LCH include the occurrence of spontaneous remissions, the extensive secretion of multiple cytokines by dendritic cells and bystander-cells (a phenomenon known as cytokine storm) in the lesional tissue, favorable prognosis and relatively good survival rate in patients without organ dysfunction or risk organ involvement.[<ref>Broadbent V, Pritchard J, Davies EG, et al. Spontaneous remission of multi-system histiocytosis X. Lancet 1984;1:253-4.</ref><ref>De Filippi P, Badulli C, Cuccia M, et al.: Specific polymorphisms of cytokine genes are associated with different risks to develop single-system or multi-system childhood Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Br J Haematol 132 (6): 784-7, 2006.  [PUBMED Abstract]</ref>] 

On the other hand, the infiltration of organs by monoclonal population of pathologic cells, and the successful treatment of subset of disseminated disease using chemotherapeutic regimens are all consistent with a neoplastic process.[<ref>3.Steen AE, Steen KH, Bauer R, et al.: Successful treatment of cutaneous Langerhans cell histiocytosis with low-dose methotrexate. Br J Dermatol 145 (1): 137-40, 2001.

Med Pediatr Oncol 33 (5): 482-5, 1999.  [PUBMED Abstract]</ref>] In addition, a demonstration, using X chromosome–linked DNA probes, of LCH as a monoclonal proliferation provided additional support for the neoplastic origin of this disease.<ref>Willman CL, Busque L, Griffith BB, et al. Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis (histiocytosis X)--a clonal proliferative disease. N Engl J Med 1994;331:154-60</ref>   While clonality is an important attribute of cancer, its presence does not prove that a proliferative process is neoplastic.  Recurrent cytogenetic or genomic abnormalities would also be required to demonstrate convincingly that LCH is a malignancy.  

Activating mutation of a protooncogen in the Raf family, the [[BRAF gene]], was detected in 35 of 61 (57%) LCH biopsy samples with mutations being more common in patients younger than 10 years (76%) than in patients aged 10 years and older (44%).<ref>Badalian-Very G, Vergilio JA, Degar BA, et al.: Recurrent BRAF mutations in Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Blood 116 (11): 1919-23, 2010.  [PUBMED Abstract]</ref> This study documented  the first recurrent mutation in LCH samples. Two independent studies have confirmed this finding.

==Signs and symptoms==

[[Image:Hans-Schuller-Christian.jpg|thumb|right|A patient with [[Hand–Schüller–Christian disease]] which is a subtype of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.]]

LCH provokes a non-specific [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which includes fever, [[lethargy]], and weight loss. Organ involvement can also cause more specific symptoms.

*Bone: The most-frequently seen symptom in both unifocal and multifocal disease is painful bone swelling. The skull is most frequently affected, followed by the long bones of the upper extremities and flat bones. Infiltration in hands and feet is unusual. Osteolytic lesions can lead to pathological fractures.
*Skin: Commonly seen are a rash which varies from scaly erythematous lesions to red papules pronounced in [[Intertrigo|intertriginous]] areas. Up to 80% of LCH patients have extensive eruptions on the scalp.
*Bone marrow: Pancytopenia with superadded infection usually implies a poor prognosis. Anemia can be due to a number of factors and does not necessarily imply bone marrow infiltration.
*Lymph node: Enlargement of the liver in 20%, spleen in 30% and lymph nodes in 50% of histiocytosis cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40002781/#notes |title=Langerhans cell histiocytosis - Patient UK |accessdate=2007-05-10 |format= |work=}}</ref>
*[[Endocrine]] glands: [[Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis|Hypothalamic pituitary axis]]  commonly involved. [[Diabetes insipidus]] is most common. [[Anterior pituitary]] [[hormone]] deficiency is usually permanent.
*Lungs: some patients are asymptomatic, diagnosed incidentally because of lung nodules on radiographs; others suffer from chronic cough and shortness of breath.
*Less frequently [[gastrointestinal tract]] and [[central nervous system]].

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Langerhans cell histiocytosis - high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing Langerhans cell histiocytosis. [[H&E stain]].]]
Diagnosis is confirmed [[histologically]] by [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[biopsy]]. Hematoxylin-eosin stain of biopsy slide will show features of Langerhans cell e.g. distinct cell margin, pink granular [[cytoplasm]]. Presence of [[Birbeck granules]] on [[electron microscopy]] and [[immunocytochemistry|immuno-cytochemical]] features e. g. [[CD1]] positivity are more specific. Initially routine blood tests e.g. full blood count, liver function test, U&Es, bone profile are done to determine disease extent and rule out other causes. Radiology will show osteolytic bone lesions and damage to the lung. The latter may be evident in [[chest X-ray]]s with [[micronodular]] and [[interstitial space|interstitial]] infiltrate in the mid and lower zone of lung, with sparing of the [[Costophrenic angle]] or [[honeycomb]] appearance in older lesions. [[MRI]] and [[Computed tomography|CT]] may show infiltration in [[sella turcica]]. Assessment of [[endocrine]] function and bonemarrow biopsy are also performed when indicated.

*[[S-100 protein]] is expressed in a cytoplasmic pattern
*[[peanut agglutinin]] (PNA) is expressed on the cell surface and perinuclearly
*major histocompatibility (MHC) class II is expressed (because histiocytes are macrophages)
*[[CD1a]]
*[[langerin]] ([[CD207]]), a Langerhans cell–restricted protein that induces the formation of Birbeck granules and is constitutively associated with them, is a highly specific marker.<ref>Valladeau J, Ravel O, Dezutter-Dambuyant C, et al. Langerin, a novel C-type lectin specific to Langerhans cells, is an endocytic receptor that induces the formation of Birbeck granules. Immunity. Jan 2000;12(1):71-81.</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment is guided by extent of disease. Solitary bone lesion may be amenable through excision or limited radiation, dosese of 5-10 Gys for children, 24-30 Gys for adults. However systemic diseases often require chemotherapy. Use of systemic steroid is common, singly or adjunct to chemotherapy. Local steroid cream is applied to skin lesions. Endocrine deficiency often require lifelong supplement e.g. [[desmopressin]] for diabetes insipidus which can be applied as nasal drop. [[Chemotherapeutic]] agents such as [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agents]], [[antimetabolites]], [[vinca alkaloids]] either singly or in combination can lead to complete remission in diffuse disease.

==Prognosis==
Excellent for single-focus disease. With multi-focal disease 60% have a chronic course, 30% achieve remission and mortality is up to 10%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Komp D, El Mahdi A, Starling K, Easley J, Vietti T, Berry D, George S |title=Quality of survival in histiocytosis X: a Southwest Oncology Group study |journal=Med.
