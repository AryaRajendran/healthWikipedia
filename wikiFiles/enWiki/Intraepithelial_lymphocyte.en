'''Intraepithelial lymphocytes''' (IEL) are [[lymphocyte]]s found in the [[epithelium|epithelial]] layer of mammalian mucosal linings, such as the [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal (GI) tract]] and [[reproductive tract]]. However, unlike other [[T cell]]s, IELs do not need priming. Upon encountering antigens, they immediately release [[cytokines]] and cause killing of infected target cells. In the GI tract, they are components of [[gut-associated lymphoid tissue]] (GALT).<ref>Defranco, Anthony L; Locksley, Richard M; Robertson, Miranda. 2007.

==Pathology==
An elevated IEL population, as determined by biopsy, typically indicates ongoing inflammation within the mucosa. In diseases such as [[coeliac sprue]], IEL elevation throughout the small intestine is one of many specific markers.<ref name="pmid16787773">

Alternatively, elevated IEL populations can be a marker for developing neoplasia in the tissue such as found in [[cervical cancer|cervical]] and [[prostate cancer|prostate]] cancers, as well as some [[colon cancer|colorectal cancers]], particularly those associated with [[Lynch syndrome]]( hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer <nowiki><HNPCC></nowiki>).<ref name=bellizzi>{{cite journal |author=Bellizzi AM, Frankel WL |year=2009 |title=Colorectal cancer due to deficiency in DNA mismatch repair function: a review |journal=Advances in Anatomic Pathology |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=405–417 |pmid=19851131 |doi=10.1097/PAP.0b013e3181bb6bdc}}</ref> IELs themselves can of course, undergo mutation to become [[lymphoma]].
