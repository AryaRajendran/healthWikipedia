'''Morgellons''' (also called '''Morgellons disease''' or '''Morgellons syndrome''') is a name given to a condition in 2002 by Mary Leitao<ref name="Gazette"/> where sufferers have the delusional belief that they are infested with [[parasites]], whereas in reality no such parasites are present.  Sufferers may exhibit a range of cutaneous symptoms such as crawling, biting, and stinging sensations ([[formication]]) and persistent skin lesions (e.g., rashes or sores).  These have been consistently identified by medical science<ref name="Schulte"/> including dermatologists,<ref name="nature">{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v12/n9/full/nm0906-982a.html |title=Mysterious 'Morgellons disease' prompts US investigation |first=Emma |last=Marris |publisher=Nature Medicine |date=2006-08-30 }}</ref> entomologists,<ref name="Ekbom">{{cite journal|last=Hinkle |first=N.C. |title=Ekbom Syndrome: a delusional condition of "bugs in the skin"|journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |year=2011 |doi=10.1007/s11920-011-0188-0 }}</ref> and psychiatrists,<ref name="AJP">{{cite journal|last=Dunn |first=J. |coauthors=Murphy, M.B., Fox, K.M. |title=Diffuse Pruritic Lesions in a 37-Year-Old Man After Sleeping in an Abandoned Building |journal=Am J Psychiatry |year=2007 |volume=164 |pages=1166–1172 |pmid=17671278 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/164/8/1166 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07030381|issue=8 }}</ref> as consistent with [[delusional parasitosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Freudenmann |first1= Roland W. |last2= Lepping |first2= Peter |year= 2009 |month= October |title= Delusional Infestation |journal= Clinical Microbiology Reviews |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=690–732 |doi= 10.1128/CMR.00018-09 |accessdate= April 4, 2012 |url= http://cmr.asm.org/content/22/4/690.long }}</ref>

Despite the lack of evidence that Morgellons is a novel or distinct condition, the absence of any agreed set of diagnostic symptoms, and the existence of an existing medically accepted diagnosis in delusional parasitosis, Leitao's "Morgellons Research Foundation" and self-diagnosed patients successfully lobbied members of Congress and the U.S. government's [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to investigate the condition.<ref name="Schulte">{{Cite news | last = Schulte | first = Brigid | title = Figments of the Imagination? | newspaper = Washington Post Magazine | pages = W10 | year =  | date = January 20, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-06-09 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/01/18/ST2008011801924.html?sid=ST2008011801924}}</ref><ref name="Investigation">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/unexplaineddermopathy/investigation.html |title=Unexplained Dermopathy (aka "Morgellons"), CDC Investigation |publisher=Centers For Disease Control |date=2007-11-01, as of 2011-05-09 last updated on 2011-03-24 }}</ref>

But I have a tremendous will to live: I've been through another pandemic – I'm a polio survivor, so I know how conservative the medical body can be.

On February 3, 2012, the Russian [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]] popular ''Let Them Talk'' show hosted by [[Andrey Malakhov]], in the programme entitled "The Curse of The World's End", featured several alleged victims of the disease in the studio, some of whom provided home-made footage.

===Mayo Clinic study===
A study conducted of 108 patients at the [[Mayo Clinic]] was published in ''[[Archives of Dermatology]]'' on May 16, 2011. The study failed to find evidence of skin infestation despite doing skin biopsies and examining specimens provided by the patients. The study, which was conducted between 2001 and 2007, concluded that the feeling of skin infestation was [[delusional parasitosis]].<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Sara A. Hylwa, BS; Jessica E.

== Symptoms and diagnosis ==
Morgellons is not recognized as a unique disorder, so there is currently no list of symptoms or [[differential diagnosis]] for Morgellons that is generally accepted by the medical community. Patients usually self-diagnose based on media reports and information from the Internet.

The 2007 ''Atlas of Human Parasitology'' covers the proposed condition in its section on "Pseudoparasites and Artifacts":

{{quote|Many dermatologists refute the suggestion that this is an actual disease but instead indicate that many of these patients have psychological problems or other common skin disorders.  Given the large numbers of individuals who feel that they have this affliction, it will be most helpful over the coming years to have a valid scientific assessment of Morgellons disease and its possible etiology (or etiologies).  One of the chief criticisms by many patients has been that they feel the medical community and other scientists consulted have not been open to the idea that there is possibly an as yet unidentified infectious or physiologic causation for the disease. However it is certainly true that many expert parasitologists, medical entomologists and other microbiologists have in fact carefully examined fibers and other materials expressed or extracted from such patients and found that biological organisms are not present. Although an apparent association of the condition with the presence of Lyme disease has been reported (Savely et al., 2006, Am J Clin Dermatol, 7:1–6), further research will be needed to help resolve the validity of Morgellons disease.  Until then, whether Morgellons disease is another name for delusional parasitosis or a real disease entity with a biologic or physiologic basis will remain up in the air.<ref name="Atlas">{{cite book |last=Ash |first=L.R. |coauthors=Orihel, T.C. |year=2007 |title=Atlas of Human Parasitology |edition=5 |publisher=American Society for Clinical Pathology Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |pages=386–387 |isbn=0-89189-167-6 }}</ref>}}

Harvey, director of the MRF medical advisory board, claimed in 2007 that Morgellons patients exhibit laboratory findings including increased levels of [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[cytokines]], increased [[insulin]], and [[antibodies]] to three bacterial pathogens, but did not provide evidence for these claims.<ref name="Harvey">{{cite journal |last=Harvey |first=W.T. |title=Morgellons disease |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |year=2007 |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=705–706 |pmid=17367622 |url=http://www.eblue.org/article/PIIS0190962207001958/fulltext |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2007.01.012 }}</ref> Many Morgellons patients have symptoms that are also consistent with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]], and [[attention deficit disorder]].<ref name="Paquette">{{cite journal |last=Paquette |first=M. |title=Morgellons: Disease or delusions? |journal=Perspectives in Psychiatric Care |year=2007 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=67–68 |pmid=17388848 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6163.2007.00113.x }}</ref> Rhonda Casey, chief of pediatrics at [[Oklahoma State University Medical Center|OSU Medical Center]], while working with the [[Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences|OSU-CHS]] for the Investigation of Morgellons Disease, stated that her Morgellons patients looked ill with neurological symptoms, which included confusion, difficulty walking and controlling their feet ([[foot drop]]), and a sagging mouth when speaking.<ref name="psychologytoday"/> The OSU-CHS has issued a list of symptoms similar to that of the MRF.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Morgellons Disease |publisher=Oklahoma State University, Center for Health Sciences |url=http://www.healthsciences.okstate.edu/morgellons/index.cfm }}</ref>

== Causes and pathophysiology ==

=== Delusional parasitosis and other neuropsychological disorders ===
Most dermatologists, psychiatrists, and other medical professionals view Morgellons as a new name for a well established condition, [[delusional parasitosis]],<ref name="Accordino">{{cite journal |author=Accordino RE, Engler D, Ginsburg IH, Koo J |title=Morgellons disease? |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=8–12 |year=2008 |pmid=18318880 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8019.2008.00164.x |url=}}</ref> also known as "delusions of parasitosis" (DP or DOP) and ''Ekbom's Syndrome''<ref name="Ekbom"/>.

This explanation is, however, "unpopular among individuals identifying themselves as having Morgellons disease."<ref name="PsychosomaticsLMS"/> 

In delusional parasitosis, patients hold a delusional belief that they are infested with parasites. They may experience [[formication]], a sensation similar to that of insects crawling on or under the skin. Individuals suffering from this condition may develop elaborate rituals of inspection and cleansing to locate and remove "parasites" and fibers, resulting in a form of self-mutilation; they injure themselves in attempts to be rid of the "parasites" by picking at the skin, causing [[lesion]]s, and then pick at the lesions, preventing them from healing.<ref name="AJP"/> Patients with delusional parasitosis often present at the doctor's office with what MDs term the "[[matchbox sign]]"<ref name="AJCD"/><ref name=koo>{{cite journal |last=Koo |first=Lebwohl |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20011201/1873.html |title=Psychodermatology: The Mind and Skin Connection |journal=American Family Physician |volume=64 |issue=11 |date=2001-12-01 }}</ref> – a [[medical sign]] characterized by the patient making collections of fibers and other foreign objects supposedly retrieved from the skin<ref name="AJP"/> – and, because of "unshakeable delusional ideation", strongly reject diagnoses that do not involve parasites.<ref name="AJCD"/><ref name="DermTher">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/j.1529-8019.2008.00163.x |title= Delusions of parasitosis |year= 2008 |author= Lee, Chai Sue |journal= Dermatologic Therapy |volume= 21 |pages= 2–7 |pmid= 18318879 |issue= 1 }}</ref> A significant minority of DP cases occur in groups of two, three, or more individuals in close proximity, even families, known by the French terms ''[[folie à deux]]'', ''[[folie à trois]]'', and ''[[folie à famille]]''.<ref name="AJCD"/> Delusional parasitosis, with symptoms that have "extraordinary similarities" to Morgellons, has been described in the medical literature for over 75 years.<ref name="JAAD">{{cite journal |last=Koblenzer |first=C.S. |title=The challenge of Morgellons disease |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |year=2006 |volume=55 |pages=920–922 |pmid=17052516 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.04.043 |issue=5 }}</ref> Dr. Noah Craft, a dermatologist at the Harbor-[[UCLA]] Medical Center, [[Torrance, California|Torrance, CA]], has seen a handful of Morgellons patients and biopsied their skin lesions, but found only normal skin and inflammation, as one would find in a bump that has been picked at.<ref name="psychologytoday"/>

Some cases of delusional parasitosis have organic causes other than those associated with neurological/psychological conditions of unknown etiology. For example, formication, the sensation that bugs are crawling under one's skin, can be caused by allergies, [[diabetic neuropathy]], [[menopause]], [[skin cancer]], [[demodex]] mites, stimulant drug abuse or [[herpes zoster]]. Both dementia and mental retardation have been reported in association with DP.<ref name="Slaughter">Slaughter JR et al.

The MRF's William Harvey has written that non-healing "Morgellons lesions" have been found on infants' bodies in locations that the infants cannot themselves reach to scratch.<ref name="Harvey"/>  

Some cases of Morgellons have been diagnosed as "cutaneous dysaesthesia".<ref name="Pop"/>

=== Role of the Internet ===
Morgellons patients usually self-diagnose based on information from the [[Internet]] and find support and confirmation in on-line communities of people with similar illness beliefs.<ref name="PsychosomaticsLMS">{{cite journal|coauthors=Lustig A, Mackay S, Strauss J |title=Morgellons Disease as Internet Meme |journal=Psychosomatics |year=2009 |volume=50 |pages=90 |pmid=19213978 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/50/1/90 |doi = 10.1176/appi.psy.50.1.90|last1=Lustig|first1=A|issue=1 }}</ref><ref name="AJPVR"/><ref name="Healy">{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1161014501.html?dids=1161014501:1161014501&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+13%2C+2006&author=Melissa+Healy&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=F.1&desc=Disease%3A+Real+or+state+of+mind%3F%3B+Morgellons+sufferers+describe+wild+symptoms+of+a+disorder+that+many+doctors+doubt+exists |title=Disease: Real or state of mind?

The ''LA Times'', in an article on Morgellons, notes that "(t)he recent upsurge in symptoms can be traced directly to the Internet, following the naming of the disease by Mary Leitao, a Pennsylvania mother."<ref name="Healy"/> Robert Bartholomew, a sociologist who has studied the Morgellons phenomenon, states that the "World Wide Web has become the incubator for mass delusion and it (Morgellons) seems to be a socially transmitted disease over the Internet." According to this hypothesis, patients with delusions of parasitosis and other psychological disorders become convinced they have "Morgellons" after reading internet accounts of others with similar symptoms.<ref name="Annapolis">Edward McSweegan, "[http://www.hometownannapolis.com/news/col/2007/07/01-25/Pathogens – PeopleInternet-helps-spread-delusion-that-Morgellons-a-disease.html Internet helps spread delusion that Morgellons a disease]".

The ''Dallas Observer'' writes that Morgellons may be spread via the Internet and mass media, and "(i)f this is the case, then Morgellons is one in a long line of weird diseases that have swept through populations, only to disappear without a trace once public concern subsides."<ref name="DallasObserver"/> The article draws parallels to several mass media-spread mass delusions. An article in the journal ''Psychosomatics'' in 2009 similarly asserts that Morgellons is an Internet [[meme]].<ref name="Psychosomatics">{{cite journal |title=Morgellons Disease as Internet Meme |journal=Psychosomatics |year=2009 |volume=50 |pages=90 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/50/1/90 |doi = 10.1176/appi.psy.50.1.90|pmid=19213978|last1=Lustig|first1=A|issue=1 |author-separator=, |author2=Lustig A. |display-authors=1 |last3=Strauss |first3=John }}</ref>

In 2008 the ''Washington Post Magazine'' reported that Internet discussions about Morgellons include many [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about the cause, including [[biological warfare]], [[nanotechnology]], [[Chemtrail conspiracy theory|chemtrails]] and [[extraterrestrial life]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/16/AR2008011603134.html|title=Figments of the Imagination?|publisher=Washington Post Magazine|date=January 20, 2008}}</ref>

=== Known skin conditions ===
Some cases of self-diagnosed Morgellons disease are actually other recognized skin disorders, including [[allergic contact dermatitis]], [[contact dermatitis]], [[idiopathic urticaria]] and infestation with the parasite [[scabies]].  There are also case reports of patients submitting self-dissected superficial nerves.<ref name="nature"/>

=== Hypotheses about the fibers ===
Randy Wymore, a former research director of the MRF and presently director of the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences' Center for the Investigation of Morgellons Disease, claims that Morgellons patients have submitted masses of dark fibers visible at 60x magnification under the unbroken skin, while unaffected individuals do not.<ref name=nature/> Wymore sent samples of fibers, none of which was collected by biopsy, to the Police Crime Lab in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], for analysis. A forensic scientist at the Tulsa Police Crime Lab in Oklahoma searched the FBI's national database, but the Morgellons sample did not match any known fiber in the database.<ref name="Primetime" /> Lab director Mark Boese said the fibers were "consistent with something that the body may be producing," adding, "These fibers cannot be manmade and do not come from a plant. This could be a byproduct of a biological organism."<ref name="Primetime">{{cite news |title='Morgellons' Mystery |publisher=ABC News Primetime |date=2006-08-09 |accessdate=2007-08-14 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Story?id=2283503&page=1}}</ref>

Conversely, in Wymore's further studies of the fibers, none of the samples he has sent to the laboratory have been unusual. Laboratory results have included nylon, cotton, human hair, a fungal fiber and a rodent hair.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/8626767/Morgellons-Disease-continues-to-defeat-scientists.html Morgellons Disease continues to defeat scientists]</ref>

Dermatologists say many fibers are from clothing embedded in self-imposed sores and the fibers patients bring in bags are textile in nature.<ref name="psychologytoday"/><ref>{{Cite news |title=All in the head? |author=Elaine Monaghan |publisher=The Times |date=2006-05-19 |accessdate=2007-08-14 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/article721795.ece | location=London}}</ref> The fibers may also be peripheral nerve endings.<ref name="dallasobserver_a" />

Although it has been suggested by Morgellons advocacy websites that Morgellons is related to an infectious disease, such as a [[tick-borne disease]] or from plants, these claims have not been substantiated by available evidence or corroborated by physicians independent of these advocacy websites.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Robles DT, Olson JM, Combs H, Romm S, Kirby P |title=Morgellons disease and delusions of parasitosis |journal=Am J Clin Dermatol |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |year=2011 |month=February |pmid=21110523 |doi=10.2165/11533150-000000000-00000 |url=}}</ref>

== Treatment ==

=== Treatment for delusional parasitosis ===
Many dermatologists treat Morgellons as delusional parasitosis. After a thorough medical examination to rule out known organic causes for the symptoms, delusional parasitosis patients are typically prescribed one of several [[typical antipsychotic]] drugs.<ref name="Koo">{{Cite journal |last1=Koo |first1=J. |last2=Lee |first2=C.S. |title=Delusions of Parasitosis: A Dermatologist's Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment |journal=Am J Clin Dermatol |year=2001 |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=285–290 |pmid=11721647 |doi=10.2165/00128071-200102050-00003 }}</ref><ref name="Meehan">{{Cite journal |last1=Meehan |first=W.J. |last2=Badreshia |first2=S. |last3=Mackley |first3=C.L. |title=Successful treatment of delusions of parasitosis with olanzapine |date=2006-03 |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=352–355 |pmid=16549712 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/142/3/352 |doi=10.1001/archderm.142.3.352 }}</ref> In the past, [[pimozide]] was the drug of choice; in addition to antipsychotic activity, it also has [[antipruritic]] activity, meaning it inhibits the sensation of itching.<ref name="Koblenzer">{{cite journal |last=Koblenzer |first=C.S. |title=Pimozide at least as safe and perhaps more effective than olanzapine for treatment of Morgellons disease |year=2006 |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=142 |issue=10 |pages=1364 |pmid=17043201 |doi=10.1001/archderm.142.10.1364-b }}</ref> However, pimozide requires frequent electrocardiographic monitoring.<ref name="Meehan"/> Currently, [[atypical antipsychotic]]s such as [[olanzapine]] or [[risperidone]] are used as first line treatment.<ref name="Meehan"/> Antipsychotics are effective at treating delusional parasitosis at doses as low as one-fifth to one-tenth the dose typically prescribed for schizophrenia.<ref name="Meehan"/> It is common for patients who believe they have Morgellons to reject a physician's diagnosis of delusional parasitosis.  It has been suggested that the term Morgellons should be adopted by dermatologists to enhance their [[rapport]] with their patients, allowing them to overcome this resistance.<ref name="Murase">{{Cite journal |last1=Murase |first=J.E. |last2=Wu |first2=J.J. |last3=Koo |first3=J. |title=Morgellons disease: A rapport-enhancing term for delusions of parasitosis |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |year=2006 |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=913–914 |pmid=17052509 |url=http://www.eblue.org/article/PIIS0190962206012175/fulltext |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.04.042 }}</ref>

=== Treatment for infectious disease ===
People who say they have Morgellons frequently reject the diagnosis of delusional parasitosis,<ref name="Pop">{{cite news |title=Making their skin crawl: people with creepy symptoms find a diagnosis on the Internet. But are they jumping to conclusions? |first=Benjamin |last=Chertoff |publisher=Popular Mechanics |date=2005-06 |page=60 }}</ref> "report that their symptoms are not taken seriously,"<ref name="AJCD"/> and refuse psychotropic medicine.  Individuals have claimed positive results from antibiotic treatment.<ref name="AJCD"/> The antibiotic treatment is not curative, because when it is discontinued, the symptoms return.<ref name="Paquette"/> Dermatologists say that these positive effects of antibiotic use for some patients are likely the result of a placebo effect or anti-inflammatory actions of the drugs. They advise against prescribing antibiotics, which may reinforce the patients' delusions instead of addressing what these doctors consider the core problem: delusional parasitosis.<ref name="Accordino"/> In addition, long-term antibiotic use can have serious side effects.

=== Self-treatment ===
Persons with Morgellons symptoms may turn to alternative remedies described on web sites and discussion groups. Some treatments are dangerous, however, and have included the use of bleach, veterinary medicines intended for deworming horses, and industrial insecticides.<ref name="CDC Probes"/>
