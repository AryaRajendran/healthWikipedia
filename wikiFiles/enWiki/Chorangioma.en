A '''chorangioma''' is a non-[[neoplasm|neoplastic]], [[hamartoma]]-like growth in the [[placenta]] consisting of [[blood vessel]]s.<ref name=pmid20594143>{{cite journal |author=Amer HZ, Heller DS |title=Chorangioma and related vascular lesions of the placenta--a review |journal=Fetal Pediatr Pathol |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=199–206 |year=2010 |pmid=20594143 |doi=10.3109/15513815.2010.487009 |url=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Large chorangiomas are diagnosed by [[ultrasound]] or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]],<ref name="pmid20594143"/> and confirmed by [[histologic]] examination of the placenta.  

Histologically, chorangioma consist of abundant vascular channels and may be cellular.

==Significance==
Most chorangiomas are not clinically significant, i.e. they do not have an adverse effect on placental function.

The significance of a chorangioma is determined by its size and whether it is found together with other chorangiomas.  Chorangiomas are significant if multiple or "large", i.e. greater than 4&nbsp;cm<ref name="pmid20594143"/> or 5&nbsp;cm.<ref name=pmid21234259>{{cite journal |author=Lež C, Fures R, Hrgovic Z, Belina S, Fajdic J, Münstedt K |title=Chorangioma placentae |journal=Rare Tumors |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=e67 |year=2010 |pmid=21234259 |pmc=3019602 |doi=10.4081/rt.2010.e67 |url=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Small chorangiomas are not treated.  Large chorangioma can be treated several ways, including chemical ablation and laser coagulation.<ref name=pmid20594143/>
