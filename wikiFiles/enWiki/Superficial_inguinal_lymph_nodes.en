The '''superficial inguinal lymph nodes''' form a chain immediately below the [[inguinal ligament]]. 

They lie deep to [[Camper's fascia]] which overlies the [[femoral artery|femoral vessels]] at medial aspect of the thigh.  

They are found in the triangle bounded by the [[inguinal ligament]] superiorly, the border of the [[sartorius muscle]] laterally, and the [[adductor longus]] muscle medially.  ([[Femoral triangle|Femoral Triangle of Scarpa]])

There are approximately 10 superficial lymph nodes.

The superficial nodes drain to the deep inguinal lymph nodes.

==Afferents received==
They receive as afferents lymphatic vessels from the following:
* [[integument]] of the [[penis]]
* [[scrotum]]
* [[perineum]]
* [[buttock]]
* [[abdominal wall]] below the level of the [[Navel|umbilicus]]
* [[vulva]]
* [[anus]] (below the [[pectinate line]])
* the thigh and the medial side of the leg (the lateral leg drains to the popliteal lymph nodes first).

==Division==
They are divided into three groups:
* Supramedial or Superomedial
* Superolateral
* Inferior
