'''Interstitial lung disease (ILD)''', also known as ''diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD)'',<ref name="pmid15879420">{{cite journal |author=King TE |title=Clinical advances in the diagnosis and therapy of the interstitial lung diseases |journal=Am.

<ref name="urlFrequently Asked Questions About Interstitial Lung Disease - University of Chicago Medical Center">{{cite web |url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/specialties/pulmonary/interstitial-lung/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Interstitial Lung Disease - University of Chicago Medical Center |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> It concerns [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] [[epithelium]], pulmonary [[capillary]] [[endothelium]], [[basement membrane]], [[perivascular]] and [[perilymphatic]] tissues.

The term ILD is used to distinguish these diseases from [[obstructive airways diseases]].

Prolonged ILD may result in [[pulmonary fibrosis]], but this is not always the case. [[Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]] is one form of "interstitial lung disease".

== Causes ==
[[Image:Alveolus diagram.svg|right|thumb|The alveoli]]
[[Image:Usual interstitial pneumonia (1).JPG|right|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of [[usual interstitial pneumonia]] (UIP). UIP is the most common pattern of [[idiopathic interstitial pneumonia]] (a type of interstitial lung disease) and usually represents [[idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]]. [[H&E stain]]. [[Autopsy]] specimen.]]
ILD may be classified according to the cause.<ref name="pmid16891438">{{cite journal |author=Bourke SJ |title=Interstitial lung disease: progress and problems |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=82 |issue=970 |pages=494–9 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16891438 |doi=10.1136/pgmj.2006.046417 |url= |pmc=2585700}}</ref>  One method of classification is as follows:
# Inhaled substances
#*Inorganic
#** [[Silicosis]]
#** [[Asbestosis]]
#** [[Berylliosis]]
#* Organic
#** [[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis]]
# Drug induced
#* [[Antibiotic]]s
#* [[Chemotherapy|Chemotherapeutic drugs]]
#* [[Antiarrhythmic agents]]
#* [[Statins]]
# Connective tissue disease
#* [[Systemic sclerosis]]
#* [[Polymyositis]]
#* [[Dermatomyositis]]
#* [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]]
#* [[Rheumatoid arthritis]]
# Infection
#* [[Atypical pneumonia]]
#* [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)]]
#* [[Tuberculosis]]
#* ''Chlamydia'' trachomatis
#* [[Respiratory Syncytial Virus]]
# Idiopathic
#* [[Sarcoidosis]]
#* [[Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]]
#* [[Hamman-Rich syndrome]]
#* [[Antisynthetase Syndrome]]
# Malignancy
#* Lymphangitic [[carcinoma]]tosis

== Investigation ==
[[Image:PCP CAP CXR.JPG|right|thumb|Patients with [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|pneumocystis pneumonia]] can present with interstitial lung disease, as seen in the reticular markings on this AP [[chest x-ray]]]]
[[Image:IPF amiodarone.JPG|thumb|A chest X-ray demonstrating [[pulmonary fibrosis]] due to [[amiodarone]].]]
Investigation is tailored towards the symptoms and signs. Most patients have blood testing, chest [[x-ray]], pulmonary function testing, and high resolution [[computerized tomography|CT]] thorax. [[HRCT]] thorax is the best mode of investigation to diagnose interstitial lung disease.

A lung [[biopsy]] is required if the clinical history and imaging are not clearly suggestive of a specific diagnosis or [[cancer|malignancy]] cannot otherwise be ruled out.

[[DLCO]] will be decreased in these patients.

== Treatment ==

ILD is not a single disease, but encompasses many different pathological processes. Hence treatment is different for each disease.

If a specific occupational exposure cause is found, the person should avoid that environment. If a [[Medication|drug]] cause is suspected, that drug should be discontinued.

Many [[idiopathic]] and [[connective tissue]]-based causes of ILD are treated with [[corticosteroid]]s,<ref name="urlInterstitial lung disease: Treatments and drugs - MayoClinic.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/interstitial-lung-disease/DS00592/DSECTION=treatments%2Dand%2Ddrugs |title=Interstitial lung disease: Treatments and drugs - MayoClinic.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> such as [[prednisolone]]. Some patients respond to [[immunosuppressant]] treatment. Patients with [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxemia]] may be given supplemental [[oxygen]].
