'''Lemierre's syndrome''' (or '''Lemierre's disease''', also known as '''postanginal shock including sepsis''' and '''human necrobacillosis''') is a form of [[thrombophlebitis]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100019144|Lemierre syndrome}}</ref> usually caused by the  bacterium ''[[Fusobacterium necrophorum]]'', and occasionally by other members of the genus ''Fusobacterium'' (''F. nucleatum, F. mortiferum and F. varium'' etc.) and usually affects young, healthy adults.  Lemierre's syndrome develops most often after a sore throat caused by some bacterium of the [[Streptococcus]] genus has created a peritonsillar abscess, a pocket filled with pus and bacteria near the tonsils. Deep in the abscess, anaerobic bacteria (microbes that do not require oxygen) like Fusobacterium necrophorum can flourish. The bacteria penetrate from the abscess into the neighboring jugular vein in the neck and there they cause an infected clot ([[thrombosis]]) to form, from which bacteria are seeded throughout the body by the bloodstream (bacteremia). Pieces of the infected clot break off and travel to the lungs as emboli blocking branches of the pulmonary artery bringing deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs. This causes shortness of breath, chest pain and severe [[pneumonia]]. Fusobacteria are a normal part of the oropharyngeal flora.

[[Sepsis]] following from a throat infection was described by Scottmuller in 1918.<ref name="Schottmuller H 1918 1440">{{Cite journal|author=Schottmuller H |title=Ueber die Pathogenität anaërober Bazillen |language=German |journal=Dtsch Med Wochenschr |year=1918 |volume=44 |issue= |pages=1440}}</ref> However it was [[André Lemierre]], in 1936, who published a series of 20 cases where throat infections were followed by identified anaerobic septicemia, of whom 18 patients died.<ref name="Lemierre">{{Cite journal|author=Lemierre A |title=On certain septicemias due to anaerobic organisms |journal=Lancet |year=1936 |volume=1 |issue= 5874|pages=701–3 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)57035-4}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms vary, but usually start with a sore throat, fever, and general body weakness. These are followed by extreme lethargy, spiked fevers, rigors, swollen cervical [[lymph node]]s and a swollen, tender or painful neck. Often there is abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting during this phase. These symptoms usually occur several days to 2 weeks after the initial symptoms.

Symptoms of pulmonary involvement can be shortness of breath, cough and painful breathing ([[pleurisy|pleuritic chest pain]]). Rarely there is [[hemoptysis]]. Painful or inflamed joints ([[arthralgia]] or [[Septic arthritis|arthritis]], respectively) exist when the joints are involved.

[[Septic shock]] can occur which presents as [[hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], [[oliguria]] and [[tachypnea]]. In cases with [[meningitis]] - [[meningism|nuchal rigidity]], headache and [[photophobia]] occur.

[[Hepatomegaly]] and [[splenomegaly]] (enlarged liver and spleen, respectively) can be found, but are not always associated with hepatic or splenic abscesses.<ref name="Syed"/><ref name="Chirinos"/>

Other signs and symptoms that may occur:
* Headache (not related to meningitis)
* Muscle pain
* [[Jaundice]]
* [[Trismus]]
* [[Rales|Crepitations]] are sometimes heard over the lungs
* [[Pericardial friction rub]]s as a sign of [[pericarditis]] (rare)
* [[Cranial nerve]] [[paralysis]] and [[Horner's syndrome]] (both rare)

==Cause==
''[[Fusobacterium necrophorum]]'' is the causative agent in most people with Lemierre's syndrome.  However only 1 in 400 cases of ''Fusobacterium necrophorum'' results in Lemierre's syndrome.<ref name="Sign In — Ann Intern Med">{{Cite web|url=http://www.annals.org/content/151/11/812.full |title=Sign In — Ann Intern Med |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> and 81% of cases of Lemierres's syndrome have been infected with ''Fusobacterium necrophorum'', while in 11% of people it was caused by other Fusobacterium species.<ref name="Sinave">{{Cite journal|author=Sinave CP, Hardy GJ, Fardy PW |year=1989 |month=March |title=The Lemierre's syndrome: suppurative thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein secondary to oropharyngeal infection |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=85–94 |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |pmid=2646510}}</ref>  [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] might also be an issue in Lemierre infections.<ref name="NCBI">{{Cite journal|author=NCBI PubMed, Bentley TP, Brennan DF |year=2009|month=August |title=Lemierre's syndrome: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) finds a new home. |journal=Medicine (Orlando)|publisher=Bentley & Brennan|pmid=18280087 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=131–4 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2007.07.066 }}</ref> Rarely Lemierre's syndrome is caused by other (usually [[Gram staining|Gram-negative]]) bacteria, which include ''[[Bacteroides fragilis]]'' and ''[[Bacteroides melaninogenicus]]'', ''[[Peptostreptococcus]] spp.'', ''[[Streptococcus microaerophile]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and ''[[Eikenella corrodens]]''.<ref name="Sinave"/><ref name="Puymirat">{{Cite journal|author=Puymirat E, Biais M, Camou F, Lefèvre J, Guisset O, Gabinski C |year=2008 |month=March |title=A Lemierre's syndrome variant caused by ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=American journal of emergency medicine test |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=380–387 |publisher=Elsevier |pmid=18358967 |doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2007.05.020}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Lemierre's syndrome is initiated by an infection of the head and neck region. Usually this infection is a pharyngitis (which occurred in 87.1% of patients as reported by a literature review<ref name="Chirinos">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1097/00005792-200211000-00006 |author=Chirinos JA, Lichtstein DM, Garcia J, Tamariz LJ |year=2002 |month=November |title=The evolution of Lemierre syndrome: report of 2 cases and review of the literature |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=458–465 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |pmid=12441902}}</ref>), but it can also be initiated by an [[otitis]], a [[mastoiditis]], a [[sinusitis]] or a [[parotitis]].

During the primary infection, ''F. necrophorum'' colonizes the infection site and the infection spreads to the [[parapharyngeal space]]. The bacteria then invade the peritonsillar blood vessels where they can spread to the [[internal jugular vein]].<ref name="Syed">{{Cite journal|author=Syed MI, Baring D, Addidle M, Murray C, Adams C |year=2007 |month=September |title=Lemierre syndrome: two cases and a review |journal=The Laryngoscope |volume=117 |issue=9 |pages=1605–1610 |publisher=The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |pmid=17762792 |doi=10.1097/MLG.0b013e318093ee0e}}</ref> In this vein, the bacteria cause the formation of a [[thrombus]] containing these bacteria. Furthermore, the [[internal jugular vein]] becomes inflamed. This septic [[thrombophlebitis]] can give rise to septic [[Septic embolism|microemboli]]<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Screaton NJ, Ravenel JG, Lehner PJ, Heitzman ER, Flower CD |year=1999 |month=November |title=Lemierre Syndrome: Forgotten but Not Extinct-Report of Four Cases |journal=Radiology |volume=213 |issue=2 |pages=369–374 |publisher=Radiological Society of North America |pmid=10551214 |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/213/2/369 |quote=The absence of proximal thrombus at CT pulmonary angiography suggests that microemboli, rather than the macroembolic clot burden more typical of acute pulmonary embolism, are responsible for the pulmonary findings in Lemierre syndrome}}</ref> that disseminate to other parts of the body where they can form abscesses and septic infarctions. The first [[capillary|capillaries]] that the emboli encounter where they can nestle themselves are the pulmonary capillaries. As a consequence, the most frequently involved site of septic metastases are the lungs, followed by the joints (knee, hip, [[sternoclavicular articulation|sternoclavicular joint]], shoulder and elbow<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s004310050730 |author=Beldman TF, Teunisse HA, Schouten TJ |year=1997 |month=November |title=Septic arthritis of the hip by Fusobacterium necrophorum after tonsillectomy: a form of Lemierre syndrome? |journal=European journal of pediatrics |volume=156 |issue=11 |pages=856–857 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |pmid=9392400}}</ref>). In the lungs, the bacteria cause abscesses, nodulary and cavitary lesions. Pleural effusion is often present.<ref name="Chirinos"/> Other sites involved in septic metastasis and abscess formation are the muscles and soft tissues, liver, spleen, kidneys and nervous system (intracranial abscesses, meningitis).<ref name="Syed"/>

Production of bacterial toxins such as [[lipopolysaccharide]] leads to secretion of [[cytokines]] by white blood cells which then both lead to symptoms of [[sepsis]]. ''F. necrophorum'' produces [[hemagglutinin]] which causes platelet aggregation that can lead to [[diffuse intravascular coagulation]] and [[thrombocytopenia]].<ref name="Kanoe">{{Cite journal|author=Kanoe M, Yamanaka M, Inoue M |year=1989 |title=Effects of Fusobacterium necrophorum on the mesenteric microcirculation of guinea pigs |journal=Medical Microbiology and Immunology |volume=178 |issue=2 |pages=99–104 |publisher=Springer Berlin / Heidelberg |pmid=2659950}}</ref><ref name="Hagelskjaer">{{Cite journal|author=Hagelskjaer Kristensen L, Prag J |year=2000 |month=Aug |title=Human necrobacillosis, with emphasis on Lemierre's syndrome |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=524–532 |pmid=10987717 |doi=10.1086/313970}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis and the imaging (and laboratory) studies to be ordered largely depend on the patient history, signs and symptoms. If a persistent sore throat, with the symptoms are found, physicians are cautioned to screen for Lemierre's syndrome.

Laboratory investigations reveal signs of a bacterial infection with elevated [[C-reactive protein]], [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] and white blood cells (notably [[neutrophils]]). Platelet count can be low or high. Liver function tests and renal function tests are often abnormal.

Thrombosis of the internal jugular vein can be displayed with [[Medical ultrasonography|sonography]]. However, thrombi that have developed recently have low echogenicity and thus will not show up on ultrasound. A CT scan or an MRI scan is more sensitive in displaying the thrombus.

[[Chest X-ray]] and chest CT may show pleural effusion, nodules, infiltrates, abscesses and cavitations.

[[Microbiological culture|Bacterial cultures]] taken from the blood, [[Arthrocentesis|joint aspirates]] or other sites can identify the causative agent of the disease.

Other illnesses that can be included in the [[differential diagnosis]] are:
* [[Q fever]]
* [[Tuberculosis]]
* [[Pneumonia]]

==Treatment==
Lemierre's syndrome is primarily treated with [[antibiotics]] given intravenously. However, because sore throats are most commonly caused by [[virus]]es, for which antibiotic treatment is unnecessary, such treatment is not usual in the first phase of the disease. Lemierre's disease proves that, rarely, antibiotics are needed for 'sore throats'.<ref name="cmo_update29">UK Chief Medical Officer Update 29 February 2001 ([http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/LettersAndCirculars/CMOUpdate/CMOUpdateArticle/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4003620&chk=8Ifdm1 CMO Update29 Feb 2001])</ref> ''Fusobacterium necrophorum'' is generally highly susceptible to [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s, [[metronidazole]], [[clindamycin]] and third generation [[cephalosporins]] while the other fusobacteria have varying degrees of resistance to beta-lactams and clindamycin.<ref name="Hagelskjaer"/> Additionally, there may exist a co-infection by another bacterium. For these reasons is often advised not to use monotherapy in treating Lemierre's syndrome. Penicillin and penicillin-derived antibiotics can thus be combined with a [[beta-lactamase inhibitor]] such as [[clavulanic acid]] or with metronidazole.<ref name="Syed"/><ref name="Puymirat"/> Clindamycin can be given as monotherapy.

If antibiotic therapy does not improve the clinical picture, it may prove useful to drain any abscesses and/or perform ligation of the internal jugular vein where the antibiotic can not penetrate.<ref name="Chirinos"/><ref name="Puymirat"/><ref name="Aspesberro">{{Cite journal|author=Aspesberro F, Siebler T, Van Nieuwenhuyse JP, Panosetti E, Berthet F |year=2008 |month=September |title=Lemierre syndrome in a 5-month-old male infant: Case report and review of the pediatric literature |journal=Pediatric critical care medicine |volume=9 |issue=5 |page=e35-37 |publisher=The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies |pmid=18779698 |doi=10.1097/PCC.0b013e31817319fa}}</ref>

There is no evidence to opt for or against the use of anticoagulation therapy. The low incidence of Lemierre's syndrome has not made it possible to set up clinical trials to study the disease.<ref name="Puymirat"/>

The disease can often be un-treatable, especially if other negative factors occur,i.e. various diseases occurring at the same time, such as [[meningitis]], [[pneumonia]].

==Prognosis==
When properly diagnosed, the mortality of Lemierre's syndrome is about 4.6%.<ref name="Sign In — Ann Intern Med"/> Since this disease is not well known and often remains undiagnosed, mortality might be much higher.

==Epidemiology==
Lemierre's syndrome is currently   rare, but was more common in the early 20th century before the discovery of [[penicillin]].  The reduced use of antibiotics for sore throats may have increased the risk of this disease, with 19 cases in 1997 and 34 cases in 1999 reported in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref name="cmo_update29" />  The incidence rate is currently 0.8 cases per million in the general population,<ref name="pmid15631168">{{Cite journal|author=Sibai K, Sarasin F |title=[Lemierre syndrome: a diagnosis to keep in mind] |language=French |journal=Revue médicale de la Suisse romande |volume=124 |issue=11 |pages=693–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15631168 |doi=}}</ref> leading it to be termed the "forgotten disease".<ref name="pmid8427443">{{Cite journal|author=Weesner CL, Cisek JE |title=Lemierre syndrome: the forgotten disease |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=256–8 |year=1993 |pmid=8427443|doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(05)80216-1}}</ref> The disease is known to affect healthy young adults.  The disease is becoming less rare with many cases being reported, however it is still known as "the forgotten disease" as many doctors are unaware of its existence, therefore often not even diagnosed which might considerably change the above mentioned statistics.  The mortality rate was 90% prior to antibiotic therapy,<ref name="Lemierre"/> but is now generally quoted as 15% once this illness is correctly diagnosed and cured with proper medical treatment, although one series of cases reported mortality as low as 6.4%.<ref name="Chirinos">{{Cite journal|author=Chirinos JA, Lichtstein DM, Garcia J, Tamariz LJ |title=The evolution of Lemierre syndrome: report of 2 cases and review of the literature |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=458–65 |year=2002 |pmid=12441902 |doi=10.1097/00005792-200211000-00006}}</ref>

==History==
[[Sepsis]] following from a throat infection was described by Scottmuller in 1918.<ref name="Schottmuller H 1918 1440"/> However it was Andre Lemierre, in 1936, who published a series of 20 cases where throat infections were followed by identified anaerobic septicemia, of whom 18 patients died.<ref name="Lemierre"/>
