'''Sir Victor Ewings Negus''', [[Master of Surgery|MS]], [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]] (6 February 1887 &ndash; 15 July 1974) was a British surgeon who specialised in [[laryngology]] and also made fundamental contributions to [[comparative anatomy]] with his work on the structure and evolution of the [[larynx]]. He was born and educated in London, studying at [[King's College School]], then [[King's College, London]], followed by [[King's College Hospital]]. The final years of his medical training were interrupted by the [[First World War]], during which he served with the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. After the war, he qualified as a surgeon and studied with laryngologists in France and the USA before resuming his career at King's College Hospital where he became a junior surgeon in 1924.

In the 1920s, Negus worked on aspects of both throat surgery and the anatomy of the larynx, the latter work contributing to his degree of [[Master of Surgery]] (1924). His surgical innovations included designs for [[laryngoscope]]s, [[bronchoscope]]s, [[oesophagoscope]]s, an operating table, and [[tracheotomy]] equipment. His major publications were ''The Mechanism of the Larynx'' (1929) and his work on the clinical text ''Diseases of the Nose and Throat'', starting with the fourth edition of 1937. Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology. He became a senior surgeon at King's College Hospital in 1940 and a [[consultant (medicine)|consulting surgeon]] in 1946.

Negus was one of the founders of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists, helping to establish his speciality as a discipline within the newly formed [[National Health Service]]. He was a member of numerous international and national [[otolaryngology]] organisations, and presided over the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology in London in 1949. In this period of his career following the Second World War he also worked on the anatomy of the [[paranasal sinuses]], and played a key role in rebuilding and establishing collections of animal dissections used by comparative anatomists.

Negus, who married in 1929 and had two sons, retired in 1952, though he continued to publish on comparative anatomy and the history of medicine. His honours before and after retirement included the Fellowship of King's College, London (1945), an honorary degree (1950), the [[Lister Medal]] (1954), a knighthood (1956), honorary fellowships of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] (1949) and the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] (1958), and the Honorary Gold Medal of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] (1969). He died in Hindhead, Surrey, aged 87 in 1974.

==Surgical career and family==

At this point, still early in his surgical career, Negus took a different approach to that which was common at the time.

In parallel with his career as a throat surgeon at a teaching hospital, Negus become a leading expert on the [[comparative anatomy]] of first the [[larynx]] and then the nose and the [[paranasal sinuses]]. This strand of his professional life started with the research he carried out in his thirties in the 1920s that eventually led to his degree of [[Master of Surgery]] (MS), awarded by the [[University of London]].<ref name="TheTimesObit"/> This work started as early as 1921 in the laboratories of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]], whose museum housed the collections of animal specimens gathered by the anatomist [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]. Working on these specimens, and adding to them with others supplied by the [[Zoological Society of London]], Negus carried out meticulous dissections that enabled him to trace the stages of evolution and development of the larynx across a wide variety of animals.<ref name="Harrison1995"/> Part of this research was submitted as his thesis, and the excellence of the work was recognised by the award of a Gold Medal with his MS degree in 1924.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1924 |title=Back matter |journal=The Journal of Laryngology & Otology |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=b1–b5 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=746880&fulltextType=XX&fileId=S0022215100026578}}</ref> In addition to this, Negus gave the Arris and Gale Lecture on 28 April 1924 at the Royal College of Surgeons, with his talk titled "On the Mechanism of the Larynx".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Negus |first1=Victor Ewings |date=17 May 1924 |title=On the Mechanism of the Larynx |journal=The Lancet |volume=203 |issue=5255 |pages=987–993 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673601666625}}</ref>

Further recognition of his work came when Negus was made Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1925,<ref name="WhoWasWho"/> followed three years later in 1928 by the awarding of the triennial John Hunter Medal (1925&ndash;7) from the Royal College of Surgeons, which came with a prize of £50.<ref>{{cite journal |date=18 May 1928 |title=Scientific Notes and News |journal=Science |volume=67 |issue=1742 |pages=505–508 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/67/1742/505.full.pdf |format=pdf| quote=The John Hunter Medal in bronze, with the triennial prize of £50, has been awarded by the Royal College of Surgeons of England to Victor Ewings Negus, for his investigations into the comparative anatomy and physiology of the larynx and the bronchi in their relation to surgery.}}</ref> The following year Negus published his observations and conclusions in ''The Mechanism of the Larynx'' (1929),<ref name="WhoWasWho"/> a "classic piece of research"<ref name="AnnalsObit"/> still referred to forty-five years later in 1974 as "the standard reference book"<ref name="AnnalsObit"/> on this topic. Negus's work had shown that the main function  of the larynx is as a valve that only allows air into the lower respiratory tract. In humans, the voice is only a byproduct of this more vital function.<ref name="BMJObit"/> Another lecture resulting from this work was given under the auspices of the University of London's Semon Lectureship, named after the German-born British laryngologist [[Felix Semon]] (1849&ndash;1921). This talk was delivered on 6 November 1930 at the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] under the title "Observations on Semon's Law".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Negus |first1=Victor Ewings |year=1931 |title=Observations on Semon's Law |journal=The Journal of Laryngology & Otology |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=1–30 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=754668}}</ref> 

These earlier works were followed after the Second World War by the publication  of ''Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Larynx'' (1949).<ref name="WhoWasWho"/> This work was a condensed and updated version of Negus's original 1929 work on the larynx.<ref>{{cite journal |date=13 May 1950 |title=The Larynx |journal=British Medical Journal | last=Wood Jones| first=Frederic| authorlink=Frederic Wood Jones| volume=1 |issue=4662 |page=1121 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2037684/pdf/brmedj03598-0028b.pdf |format=pdf | pmc=2037684}}</ref> It was in this post-war period that Negus would increasingly study the function of the nose, both as the organ for the sense of smell ([[olfaction]]) and the role of the nose in [[respiratory tract|respiration]]. This was prompted by wartime damage in 1941 to the Royal College of Surgeons' Hunterian Museum, which included the loss of parts of the Onodi Collection. This collection had contained specimens of the accessory sinuses (paranasal sinuses) prepared by the Hungarian laryngologist [[Adolf Onodi]] (1857&ndash;1919) and demonstrated by him in 1900.

==Societies and administration==

As one of the leading practitioners in his speciality, Negus served in many roles in its organisation and administration at both a national and international level. In particular, he worked closely with the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the body responsible for the accreditation and representation of surgeons practising in England and Wales, and also the organisation that supported him in his researches in comparative anatomy. The Royal College of Surgeons is located in London, and from 1939 to 1941 he was President of its Listerian Society.<ref name="BMJObit"/>

In 1942, Negus was President of the Section of Laryngology at the Royal Society of Medicine.<ref name="ODNB"/> When Negus had been training as a surgeon, laryngology, rhinology and otology had been part of general surgery, but this was changing with the advent of ENT (ear, nose and throat) medicine as a combined and specialised discipline. Negus and colleagues attempted to set up the necessary structure within the Royal Society of Medicine to represent their profession as an emerging speciality, but the regulations in place would not allow the type of organisation they had planned. This led them, in 1943, to found the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists which would be able to represent ENT surgeons through the Royal College of Surgeons.<ref name="AnnalsObit"/>{{#tag:ref|More details of the founding of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists (BAO) were published in an announcement made in October 1943 in ''The Journal of Laryngology & Otology'' by one of the co-founders Frank Cunliffe Ormerod.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ormerod |first=Frank Cunliffe |year=1943 | month=October| title=British Association of Otolaryngologists |journal=The Journal of Laryngology & Otology |volume=58 |issue=10 |page=436 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=762500}}</ref> This organisation subsequently became the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists – Head and Neck Surgeons (BAO-HNS), which since 2008 has been ENT•UK, which formed as a merger between BAO-HNS and the British Academic Conference in Otolaryngology (BACO).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.entuk.org.uk/about/| title=About ENT•UK| publisher=ENT•UK British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists – Head and Neck Surgeons| accessdate=6 April 2012}}</ref> For more on the early history of the organisation founded by Negus and colleagues, see ''The Role of the British Association of Otolaryngologists (BAOL) in the Development of Otolaryngology in Great Britain from 1943-1968'' (Neil Francis Weir, University of London, 2008).|group="n"}} Following the war, Negus was co-opted to the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1947, and was the first to represent otolaryngology at that level. He was also a member of the college's Court of Examiners, and worked to set up the first examination in otorhinolaryngology that could be taken for the FRCS diploma.<ref name="AnnalsObit"/> This reorganisation was taking place against a background of immense change in how medicine was practised in the UK, due to the advent of the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). Negus's colleague, Geoffrey Bateman, writing in 1974, credits him with having the foresight to represent the interests of otolaryngology and see it established as a major speciality in its own right within the NHS.<ref name="AnnalsObit"/>

Negus became President of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists in 1951, and this was one of a number of presidencies he held, including that of the Thoracic Society (1949&ndash;50) and the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology.<ref name="BMJObit"/> The latter was a large event that took place in London over a week in July 1949. It was held in the Great Hall of King's College, London, and was attended by over 700 otolaryngology specialists from 39 countries. The patron was [[King George VI]] and the congress was opened by the [[Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark|Duchess of Kent]].<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Ear, Nose, And Throat Research Opening Of Congress |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=19 July 1949 |page_number= 3 |issue= 51437|column= G}}</ref> Negus was President and host for the 1954 annual meeting of the Collegium Oto-rhino-laryngologicum Amicitiae Sacrum (CORLAS), held in London from 29 August to 1 September,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Huizinga |first=Eelco |year=1954 |title=Ordinary Meeting of the Collegium O.R.L.A.S., London, 29 August–1 September 1954 |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=44 |issue=5–6 |pages=389–392 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00016485409127646 |doi=10.3109/00016485409127646}}</ref> and was the treasurer of CORLAS from 1936 to 1950.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.corlas.org/History.htm| title=History| publisher=Collegium Oto-rhino-laryngologicum Amicitiae Sacrum| accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>  Negus was also associated with, and gave talks to, numerous medical societies in the UK and abroad, with his connections ranging from honorary fellowships to corresponding and honorary memberships. These foreign societies included the [[American Broncho-Esophagological Association]], and the countries included Sweden, Denmark, Canada, the USA, Austria, France, Italy, Hungary, and Turkey.<ref name="WhoWasWho"/>{{#tag:ref|The entry for Negus in ''Who Was Who'' includes a listing of these societies.<ref name="WhoWasWho"/>|group="n"}} Bateman opined in his obituary of Negus that it seemed unlikely that any other British ENT surgeon "has been honoured by so many societies".<ref name="AnnalsObit"/>

Following his retirement, Negus continued his involvement with the Royal College of Surgeons, becoming a trustee (and later chairman of the trustees) of the Hunterian Collection, the same collection that included the specimens that had underpinned his research some thirty years earlier.<ref name="BMJObit"/> He also published books on the history of the college and its collections: ''The History of the Trustees of the Hunterian Collection'' (1965); and ''The Artistic Possessions at the Royal College of Surgeons of England'' (1968).<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="AnnalsObit"/>

==Honours, awards and legacy==
In his later years, Negus received many awards and honours. In 1945, he was made a Fellow of King's College, London.<ref name="ODNB"/>{{#tag:ref|The Fellowship and Honorary Fellowship of King's College, London (designated FKC) is not a research appointment, but is rather an award, established in 1847, and conferred "in recognition of [...] exceptional achievement and/or service rendered to the College".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/governance/committees/fellowshipsFAQs2010.pdf | title=Fellowships and Honorary Degrees: Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=King's College, London | format=pdf| accessdate=6 April 2012}}</ref>|group="n"}} On 25 July 1949, he received the honorary fellowship of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=6 August 1949 |title=Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=2 |issue=4622 |page=341 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2050569/pdf/brmedj03636-0028b.pdf |format=pdf| quote=At a reception held on July 25 the Honorary Fellowship of the College was conferred on Mr. Victor Ewings Negus.

On 13 February 1969, Negus and two others (Sir [[Geoffrey Keynes]] and Sir [[Stanford Cade]]) were presented with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art."<ref name="HonGoldMedal">{{cite journal| year=1969 |month=March |title=Award of the Honorary Medal of the College |journal=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=169–171 |pmc=2387590}}</ref> The medal was presented by Sir [[Hedley Atkins]], the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: "Sir Victor Negus is perhaps the most distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense."<ref name="HonGoldMedal"/> Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back and leave it to others to carry on. I would also like to thank you for inviting my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done."<ref name="HonGoldMedal"/>{{#tag:ref|Both the [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] entry for Negus, by consultant ENT surgeon Neil Weir, and Bateman's obituary in the [[Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England]], give details of the role played by Negus's wife Eve, describing her as "an artist of considerable merit" who illustrated several of his books.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="AnnalsObit"/>|group="n"}}
