'''Oxygen toxicity''' is a condition resulting from the harmful effects of breathing molecular [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) at elevated [[partial pressure]]s. It is also known as '''oxygen toxicity syndrome''', '''oxygen intoxication''', and '''oxygen poisoning'''. Historically, the [[central nervous system]] condition was called the '''[[Paul Bert]] effect''', and the [[pulmonary]] condition the '''[[James Lorrain Smith|Lorrain Smith]] effect''', after the researchers who pioneered its discovery and description in the late 19th century. Severe cases can result in [[cell (biology)|cell]] damage and death, with effects most often seen in the central nervous system, [[lung]]s and eyes. Oxygen toxicity is a concern for [[scuba diver]]s, those on high concentrations of supplemental oxygen (particularly [[preterm birth|premature]] babies), and those undergoing [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]].

The result of breathing elevated concentrations of oxygen is [[wikt:hyperoxia|hyperoxia]], an excess of oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways depending on the type of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high concentrations of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to elevated oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as [[myopia]]. Prolonged or very high oxygen concentrations can cause [[oxidative damage]] to [[cell membranes]], the collapse of the [[alveoli]] in the lungs, [[retinal detachment]], and [[seizures]]. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to elevated oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.

[[Medical guideline|Protocols]] for avoidance of hyperoxia exist in fields where oxygen is breathed at higher-than-normal partial pressures, including [[underwater diving]] using compressed [[breathing gases]], hyperbaric medicine, [[neonatal care]] and [[human spaceflight]]. These protocols have resulted in the increasing rarity of seizures due to oxygen toxicity, with pulmonary and ocular damage being mainly confined to the problems of managing premature infants.

In recent years, oxygen has become available for recreational use in [[oxygen bar]]s. The [[US Food and Drug Administration]] has warned those suffering from problems such as heart or lung disease not to use oxygen bars. Scuba divers use breathing gases containing up to 100% oxygen, and should have specific training in using such gases.

The effects of oxygen toxicity may be classified by the organs affected, producing three principal forms:{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|pp=358–360}}<ref name="Acott" /><ref name="pmid14232720" />

* Central nervous system, characterised by [[seizure|convulsions]] followed by unconsciousness, occurring under hyperbaric conditions;
* Pulmonary (lungs), characterised by difficulty in breathing and pain within the chest, occurring when breathing elevated pressures of oxygen for extended periods;
* Ocular ([[retinopathy|retinopathic conditions]]), characterised by alterations to the eyes, occurring when breathing elevated pressures of oxygen for extended periods.

Central nervous system oxygen toxicity can cause seizures, brief periods of rigidity followed by convulsions and unconsciousness, and is of concern to divers who encounter greater than atmospheric pressures. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity results in damage to the lungs, causing pain and difficulty in breathing. Oxidative damage to the eye may lead to myopia or partial detachment of the [[retina]]. Pulmonary and ocular damage are most likely to occur when supplemental oxygen is administered as part of a treatment, particularly to newborn infants, but are also a concern during hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Oxidative damage may occur in any cell in the body but the effects on the three most susceptible organs will be the primary concern. It may also be implicated in red blood cell destruction ([[hemolysis|haemolysis]]),<ref name="pmid5782651" /><ref name="pmid4403030" /> damage to liver ([[hepatic]]),<ref name="pmid5885427" /> heart ([[myocardial]]),<ref name="pmid5046798" /> [[endocrine system|endocrine]] glands ([[adrenal gland|adrenal]], [[gonad]]s, and [[thyroid]]),<ref name="pmid13228600" /><ref name="pmid13889254" /><ref name="Gersh" /> or kidneys ([[renal]]),<ref name="pmid5155150" /> and general damage to [[cell (biology)|cells]].{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|pp=358–360}}<ref name="pmid4613232" />

In unusual circumstances, effects on other tissues may be observed: it is suspected that during spaceflight, high oxygen concentrations may contribute to bone damage.<ref name="Patel" /> Hyperoxia can also indirectly cause [[CO2 retention|carbon dioxide narcosis]] in patients with lung ailments such as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] or with central respiratory depression.<ref name="Patel" />  [[Hyperventilation]] of atmospheric air at atmospheric pressures does not cause oxygen toxicity, because sea-level air a has a partial pressure of oxygen (pp{{chem|O|2}}) of {{convert|0.21|bar|abbr=on}} and the lower limit for toxicity is more than {{convert|0.3|bar|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Clark|Lambertsen|1970|p=}}

=== Central nervous system ===

[[Central nervous system]] oxygen toxicity manifests as symptoms such as visual changes (especially [[tunnel vision]]), ringing in the ears ([[tinnitus]]), [[nausea]], twitching (especially of the face), irritability (personality changes, [[anxiety]], confusion, etc.), and [[Vertigo (medical)|dizziness]]. This may be followed by a [[tonic–clonic seizure]] consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the [[postictal state]]).{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=376}}{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2008|p=44|loc=vol. 1, ch. 3}} The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen (pp{{chem|O|2}}) in the [[breathing gas]] and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day.{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=376}}{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2008|p=22|loc=vol. 4, ch. 18}}<ref name="Bitterman" /> In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms.{{sfn|Donald, Part I|1947}} Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of [[carbon dioxide]].{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=82}}<ref name="rebreather2.0" /><ref name="padi" /> Other factors, such as darkness and [[caffeine]], increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.<ref name="pmid3705247" /><ref name="pmid8574677" />

=== Pulmonary ===

Pulmonary toxicity symptoms result from an inflammation that starts in the airways leading to the lungs and then spreads into the lungs ([[tracheobronchial tree]]). The symptoms appear in the upper chest region ([[Human sternum|substernal]] and [[Carina of trachea|carinal]] regions).{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=383}}<ref name="pmid4948324" /><ref name="pmid4929472" /> This begins as a mild tickle on inhalation and progresses to frequent coughing.{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=383}} If breathing elevated partial pressures of oxygen is not discontinued, patients experience a mild burning on inhalation along with uncontrollable coughing and occasional shortness of breath ([[dyspnea|dyspnoea]]).{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=383}} Physical findings related to pulmonary toxicity have included bubbling sounds heard through a [[stethoscope]] (bubbling [[rales]]), fever, and increased blood flow to the lining of the nose ([[hyperaemia]] of the nasal [[mucosa]]).<ref name="pmid4929472" /> The radiological finding from the lungs shows [[inflammation]] and swelling ([[pulmonary edema|pulmonary oedema]]).{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=383}}<ref name="pmid4948324" /> [[Spirometry|Pulmonary function measurements]] are reduced, as noted by a reduction in the amount of air that the lungs can hold ([[vital capacity]]) and changes in expiratory function and lung elasticity.<ref name="pmid4929472" />{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|pp=386–387}} Tests in animals have indicated a variation in tolerance similar to that found in central nervous system toxicity, as well as significant variations between species. When the exposure to oxygen above {{convert|0.5|bar|abbr=on}} is intermittent, it permits the lungs to recover and delays the onset of toxicity.<ref name="Smith" />

=== Ocular ===

In premature babies, signs of damage to the eye ([[retinopathy of prematurity]], or ROP) are observed via an [[ophthalmoscope]] as a demarcation between the [[wikt:vascularize|vascularised]] and non-vascularised regions of an infant's retina. The degree of this demarcation is used to designate four stages: (I) the demarcation is a line; (II) the demarcation becomes a ridge; (III) growth of new blood vessels occurs around the ridge; (IV) the retina begins to detach from the inner wall of the eye ([[choroid]]).<ref name="Best" />

== Causes ==

Oxygen toxicity is caused by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to which the body is normally exposed. This occurs in three principal settings: underwater diving, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and the provision of supplemental oxygen, particularly to premature infants. In each case, the [[risk factors]] are markedly different.

=== Central nervous system toxicity ===

{{see also|Technical diving}}

Exposures, from minutes to a few hours, to partial pressures of oxygen above {{convert|1.6|bar|lk=on}}—about eight times the atmospheric concentration—are usually associated with central nervous system oxygen toxicity and are most likely to occur among patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy and divers. Since atmospheric pressure is about {{convert|1|bar|abbrev=on}}, central nervous system toxicity can only occur under [[hyperbaric]] conditions, where [[ambient pressure]] is above normal.<ref name="smerz" /><ref name="hampson215-9" /> Divers breathing air at depths greater than {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} face an increasing risk of an oxygen toxicity "hit" (seizure). Divers breathing a gas mixture enriched with oxygen, such as [[nitrox]], can similarly suffer a seizure at shallower depths, should they descend below the maximum depth allowed for the mixture.{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=7}}

=== Pulmonary toxicity ===

The lungs, as well as the remainder of the [[respiratory tract]], are exposed to the highest concentration of oxygen in the human body and are therefore the first organs to show toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity occurs with exposure to concentrations of oxygen greater than {{convert|0.5|bar|abbr=on}}, corresponding to an oxygen fraction of 50% at normal atmospheric pressure.  Signs of pulmonary toxicity begins with evidence of tracheobronchitis, or inflammation of the upper airways, after an asymptomatic period between 4 and 22 hours at greater than 95% oxygen,<ref name="Bitterman2009" /> with some studies suggesting symptoms usually begin after approximately 14 hours at this level of oxygen.<ref name="Jackson" />

At partial pressures of oxygen of {{convert|2|to|3|bar|abbr=on}}—100% oxygen at 2 to 3 times atmospheric pressure—these symptoms may begin as early as 3 hours after exposure to oxygen.<ref name="Bitterman2009" />  Experiments on rats show pulmonary manifestations of oxygen toxicity are not the same for [[:wikt:normobaric|normobaric]] conditions as they are for [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric]] conditions.<ref name="pmid17416738" /> Evidence of decline in lung function as measured by pulmonary function testing can occur as quickly as 24 hours of continuous exposure to 100% oxygen,<ref name="Jackson" /> with evidence of [[diffuse alveolar damage]] and the onset of [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] usually occurring after 48 hours on 100% oxygen.<ref name="Bitterman2009" /> Breathing 100% oxygen also eventually leads to collapse of the [[alveoli]] ([[atelectasis]]), while—at the same partial pressure of oxygen—the presence of significant partial pressures of inert gases, typically nitrogen, will prevent this effect.<ref name="Wittner" />

Preterm newborns are known to be at higher risk for [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]] with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen.<ref name="Bancalari" />  Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on [[mechanical ventilation]] with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent [[bleomycin]].<ref name="Jackson" /> Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in [[intensive care]] suggests keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%.<ref name="Bitterman2009" />  Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of [[decompression sickness]] are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.<ref name="smerz" />

=== Ocular toxicity ===

{{see also|Retinopathy of prematurity}}

Prolonged exposure to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes damage to the [[retina]].<ref name="NEDU47" /><ref name="pmid754368" /><ref name="pmid1701697" /> Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions.<ref name="pmid9603802" /><ref name="Butler" /> Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants.<ref name="pmid9603802" /><ref name="Nichols" /> In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs when the development of the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is [[Granulation tissue|fibrous tissue]] (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a [[risk factor]], is '''not''' the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.<ref name="pmid9603802" />

Hyperoxic [[myopia]] has occurred in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures.<ref name="Butler" /><ref name="shykoff3492" /><ref name="pmid18500077" /> It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy.<ref name="pmid754368" /><ref name="myopialength" /> This is due to an increase in the refractive power of the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]], since axial length and [[Keratometer|keratometry]] readings do not reveal a [[cornea]]l or length basis for a myopic shift.<ref name="myopialength" /><ref name="pmid16358652" /> It is usually reversible with time.<ref name="pmid754368" /><ref name="myopialength" />

== Mechanism ==

{{main|Reactive oxygen species|Oxidative stress}}
[[File:Lipid peroxidation.svg|thumb|300px|The lipid peroxidation mechanism shows a single radical initiating a chain reaction which converts unsaturated lipids to lipid peroxides, |alt=An unsaturated lipid reacts with a hydroxyl radical to form a lipid radical (initiation), which then reacts with di-oxygen, forming a lipid peroxyl radical. This then reacts with another unsaturated lipid, yielding a lipid peroxide and another lipid radical, which can continue the reaction (propagation).]]

The biochemical basis for the toxicity of oxygen is the partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form reactive oxygen species,{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=360}} which are natural by-products of the normal [[metabolism]] of oxygen and have important roles in [[cell signalling]].<ref name="pmid16809515" /> One species produced by the body, the [[superoxide]] anion ({{chem|O|2}}<sup>–</sup>),<ref name="pmid1316738" /> is possibly involved in iron acquisition.<ref name="pmid12791678" /> Higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to increased levels of reactive oxygen species.<ref name="Fridovich" /> Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, and the blood supplies it to all parts of the body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread, with the most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of reactive oxygen species can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce [[oxidative stress]].<ref name="Bitterman" /><ref name="pmid18549826" />

While all the reaction mechanisms of these species within the body are not yet fully understood,<ref name="Imlay2003" /> one of the most reactive products of oxidative stress is the [[hydroxyl radical]] ('''·'''OH), which can initiate a damaging chain reaction of [[lipid peroxidation]] in the unsaturated [[lipids]] within [[cell membranes]].<ref name="Bowen" /> High concentrations of oxygen also increase the formation of other [[free radical]]s, such as [[nitric oxide]], [[peroxynitrite]], and [[trioxidane]], which harm [[DNA]] and other biomolecules.<ref name="Bitterman" /><ref name="pmid1329105" /> Although the body has many [[antioxidant]] systems such as [[glutathione]] that guard against oxidative stress, these systems are eventually overwhelmed at very high concentrations of free oxygen, and the rate of cell damage exceeds the capacity of the systems that prevent or repair it.<ref name="pmid2825395" /><ref name="pmid10372426" /><ref name="pmid15485085" /> Cell damage and cell death then result.<ref name="pmid1886163" />

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis of central nervous system oxygen toxicity in divers prior to seizure is difficult as the symptoms of visual disturbance, ear problems, dizziness, confusion and nausea can be due to many factors common to the underwater environment such as [[Nitrogen narcosis|narcosis]], congestion and coldness. However, these symptoms may be helpful in diagnosing the first stages of oxygen toxicity in patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy. In either case, unless there is a prior history of [[epilepsy]] or tests indicate [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycaemia]], a seizure occurring in the setting of breathing oxygen at partial pressures greater than {{convert|1.4|bar|abbr=on}} suggests a diagnosis of oxygen toxicity.<ref name="NBDHMT" />

Diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborn infants with breathing difficulties is difficult in the first few weeks. However, if the infant's breathing does not improve during this time, [[blood tests]] and [[x-rays]] may be used to confirm bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In addition, an [[echocardiogram]] can help to eliminate other possible causes such as [[congenital heart defects]] or [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]].<ref name="nih bpd_Diagnosis" />

The diagnosis of retinopathy of prematurity in infants is typically suggested by the clinical setting. Prematurity, low birth weight and a history of oxygen exposure are the principal indicators, while no hereditary factors have been shown to yield a pattern.{{sfn|Regillo|Brown|Flynn|1998|p=178}}

== Prevention ==

[[File:Cylinder mod.jpg|thumb|The label on the diving cylinder shows that it contains oxygen-rich gas (36%) and is boldly marked with a maximum operating depth of 28&nbsp;metres. |alt=Closeup of a diving cylinder with a band reading "NITROX". A hand-printed label at the neck reads "MOD 28m 36% O2", with the 28 in much larger size.]]

The prevention of oxygen toxicity depends entirely on the setting. Both underwater and in space, proper precautions can eliminate the most pernicious effects. Premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth. In this case prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity must be carried out without compromising a supply of oxygen adequate to preserve the infant's life.

=== Underwater ===

{{see also|Maximum operating depth}}

A seizure caused by oxygen toxicity to the central nervous system is a deadly but avoidable event while [[Underwater diving|diving]].{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=7}} The diver may experience no warning symptoms.{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2008|p=44|loc=vol. 1, ch. 3}} The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their [[Diving regulator|regulator]] and drown.<ref name="pmid23342767">{{cite journal |author=[[Simon Mitchell|Mitchell, Simon J]]; Bennett, Michael H; Bird, Nick; Doolette, David J; [[Gene Hobbs|Hobbs, Gene W]]; Kay, Edward; Moon, Richard E; Neuman, Tom S; Vann, Richard D; Walker, Richard; Wyatt, HA |title=Recommendations for rescue of a submerged unresponsive compressed-gas diver |journal=Undersea & Hyperbaric Medicine : Journal of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1099–108 |year=2012 |pmid=23342767 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/10161 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}</ref>{{sfn|Clark|Thom|2003|p=375}} One of the advantages of a [[full-face diving mask]] is prevention of regulator loss in the event of a seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a [[maximum operating depth]] for oxygen-rich [[breathing gas]]es, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.<ref name="padi" />{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=195}}

In some [[diver training]] courses for these types of diving, divers are taught to plan and monitor what is called the ''oxygen clock'' of their dives.{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=195}} This is a notional alarm clock, which ticks more quickly at increased pp{{chem|O|2}} and is set to activate at the maximum single exposure limit recommended in the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] Diving Manual.<ref name="padi" />{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=195}} For the following partial pressures of oxygen the limit is: 45&nbsp;minutes at {{convert|1.6|bar|abbr=on}}, 120&nbsp;minutes at {{convert|1.5|bar|abbr=on}}, 150&nbsp;minutes at {{convert|1.4|bar|abbr=on}}, 180&nbsp;minutes at {{convert|1.3|bar|abbr=on}} and 210&nbsp;minutes at {{convert|1.2|bar|abbr=on}}, but is impossible to predict with any reliability whether or when toxicity symptoms will occur.<ref name="Butler3727183" /><ref name="Butler15233156" /> Many [[nitrox]]-capable [[dive computer]]s calculate an oxygen loading and can track it across multiple dives. The aim is to avoid activating the alarm by reducing the pp{{chem|O|2}} of the breathing gas or the length of time breathing gas of higher pp{{chem|O|2}}. As the pp{{chem|O|2}} depends on the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas and the depth of the dive, the diver obtains more time on the oxygen clock by diving at a shallower depth, by breathing a less oxygen-rich gas, or by shortening the duration of exposure to oxygen-rich gases.{{sfn|Clark|Lambertsen|1970|pp=157–162}}<ref name="Baker2000" />

Diving below {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} on air would expose a diver to increasing danger of oxygen toxicity as the partial pressure of oxygen exceeds {{convert|1.4|bar|abbr=on}}, so a gas mixture must be used which contains less than 21% oxygen (a hypoxic mixture). Increasing the proportion of [[nitrogen]] is not viable, since it would produce a strongly [[Nitrogen narcosis|narcotic]] mixture. However, [[helium]] is not narcotic, and a usable mixture may be [[Gas blending|blended]] either by completely replacing nitrogen with helium (the resulting mix is called [[heliox]]), or by replacing part of the nitrogen with helium, producing a [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]].{{sfn|Hamilton|Thalmann|2003|p=}}

Pulmonary oxygen toxicity is an entirely avoidable event while diving. The limited duration and naturally intermittent nature of most diving makes this a relatively rare (and even then, reversible) complication for divers.{{sfn|Clark|Lambertsen|1970|p=}} Guidelines have been established that allow divers to calculate when they are at risk of pulmonary toxicity.<ref name="repex1" /><ref name="repex2" /><ref name="spums" />

=== Hyperbaric setting ===

The presence of a fever or a history of seizure is a relative contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen treatment.<ref name="Latham2008" /> The schedules used for treatment of [[decompression illness]] allow for periods of breathing air rather than 100% oxygen (oxygen breaks) to reduce the chance of seizure or lung damage. The U.S. Navy uses treatment tables based on periods alternating between 100% oxygen and air. For example, USN table 6 requires 75&nbsp;minutes (three periods of 20&nbsp;minutes oxygen/5&nbsp;minutes air) at an ambient pressure of {{convert|2.8|atm|lk=in}}, equivalent to a depth of {{convert|18|m|ft|sigfig=1}}. This is followed by a slow reduction in pressure to {{convert|1.9|atm|abbr=on}} over 30&nbsp;minutes on oxygen. The patient then remains at that pressure for a further 150&nbsp;minutes, consisting of two periods of 15&nbsp;minutes air/60&nbsp;minutes oxygen, before the pressure is reduced to atmospheric over 30&nbsp;minutes on oxygen.{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2008|p=41|loc=vol. 5, ch. 20}}

[[Vitamin E]] and [[selenium]] were proposed and later rejected as a potential method of protection against pulmonary oxygen toxicity.<ref name="Schatte" /><ref name="pmid1852722" /><ref name="GUEdvd" /> There is however some experimental evidence in rats that vitamin E and selenium aid in preventing ''[[in vivo]]'' [[lipid peroxidation]] and free radical damage, and therefore prevent retinal changes following repetitive hyperbaric oxygen exposures.<ref name="pmid2744583" />

=== Normobaric setting ===

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is reversible in the early stages by use of break periods on lower pressures of oxygen, but it may eventually result in irreversible lung injury if allowed to progress to severe damage. One or two days of exposure without oxygen breaks are needed to cause such damage.<ref name="Patel" />

Retinopathy of prematurity is largely preventable by screening. Current guidelines require that all babies of less than 32&nbsp;weeks [[gestational age]] or having a birth weight less than {{convert|1.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} should be screened for retinopathy of prematurity at least every two weeks.<ref name="rcpch" /> The ''National Cooperative Study'' in 1954 showed a causal link between supplemental oxygen and retinopathy of prematurity, but subsequent curtailment of supplemental oxygen caused an increase in infant mortality. To balance the risks of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and retinopathy of prematurity, modern protocols now require monitoring of blood oxygen levels in premature infants receiving oxygen.<ref name="Silverman" />

=== Hypobaric setting ===

In low-pressure environments oxygen toxicity may be avoided since the toxicity is caused by high partial pressure of oxygen, not merely by high oxygen fraction. This is illustrated by modern pure oxygen use in spacesuits, which must operate at low pressure (also historically, very high percentage oxygen and lower than normal atmospheric pressure was used in early spacecraft, for example, the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Apollo spacecraft]]).<ref name="pmid2730484" /> In such applications as [[extra-vehicular activity]], high-fraction oxygen is non-toxic, even at breathing mixture fractions approaching 100%, because the oxygen partial pressure is not allowed to [[Chronic toxicity|chronically]] exceed {{convert|0.3|bar|psi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="pmid2730484" />

During hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the patient will usually breathe 100% oxygen from a mask while inside a hyperbaric chamber pressurised with air to about {{convert|2.8|bar|abbr=on}}. Seizures during the therapy are managed by removing the mask from the patient, thereby dropping the partial pressure of oxygen inspired below {{convert|0.6|bar|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2008|p=44|loc=vol. 1, ch. 3}}

A seizure underwater requires that the diver be brought to the surface as soon as practicable. Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to the danger of [[arterial gas embolism]] (AGE),{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2008|p=45|loc=vol. 1, ch. 3}}, there is some evidence that the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway.<ref name="RBW2008" /> This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society that a diver should be raised during the seizure's clonic (convulsive) phase if the regulator is not in the diver's mouth&nbsp;– as the danger of drowning is then greater than that of AGE&nbsp;– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the clonic phase otherwise.<ref name="Mitchell2012" /> Rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure that where the victim's air supply is established it is maintained, and carry out a [[controlled buoyant lift]]. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most [[diver training]] agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention.<ref name="DANoxtox" /> The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available.{{sfn|U.S. Navy Diving Manual|2008|pp=37–39|loc=vol. 2, ch. 9}}

The occurrence of symptoms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or acute respiratory distress syndrome  is treated by lowering the fraction of oxygen administered, along with a reduction in the periods of exposure and an increase in the break periods where normal air is supplied. Where supplemental oxygen is required for treatment of another disease (particularly in infants), a [[ventilator]] may be needed to ensure that the lung tissue remains inflated. Reductions in pressure and exposure will be made progressively, and medications such as [[bronchodilators]] and [[pulmonary surfactant]]s may be used.<ref name="MPBPD" />

Retinopathy of prematurity may [[Regression (medicine)|regress]] spontaneously, but should the disease progress beyond a threshold (defined as five contiguous or eight cumulative hours of [[Retinopathy of prematurity#International classification of retinopathy of prematurity .28ICROP.29|stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity]]), both [[cryosurgery]] and [[laser surgery]] have been shown to reduce the risk of blindness as an outcome. Where the disease has progressed further, techniques such as [[Scleral buckle|scleral buckling]] and [[vitrectomy]] surgery may assist in re-attaching the retina.{{sfn|Regillo|Brown|Flynn|1998|p=184}}

== Prognosis ==

Although the convulsions caused by central nervous system oxygen toxicity may lead to incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following the seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen, no long-term neurological damage from the seizure remains.<ref name="Bitterman" /><ref name="FennRahn" />

The majority of infants who have survived following an incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia  will eventually recover near-normal lung function, since lungs continue to grow during the first 5–7 years and the damage caused by bronchopulmonary dysplasia is to some extent reversible (even in adults). However, they are likely be more susceptible to respiratory infections for the rest of their lives and the severity of later infections is often greater than that in their peers.<ref name="nih bpd_WhatIs" /><ref name="kidshealth" />

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants frequently regresses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years. Where the disease has progressed to the stages requiring surgery, the outcomes are generally good for the treatment of stage 3 ROP, but are much worse for the later stages. Although surgery is usually successful in restoring the anatomy of the eye, damage to the nervous system by the progression of the disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision. The presence of other complicating diseases also reduces the likelihood of a favourable outcome.{{sfn|Regillo|Brown|Flynn|1998|p=190}}

[[File:Incidence of ROP.svg|thumb|400px |alt=Percentage of severe visual impairment and blindness due to ROP in children in Schools for the Blind in different regions of the world: Europe 6–17%; Latin America 4.1–38.6%; Eastern Europe 25.9%; Asia 16.9%; Africa 10.6%. |Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is more common in middle income countries where neonatal intensive care services are increasing; but greater awareness of the problem, leading to preventive measures, has not yet occurred.<ref name="Gilbert" />]]

The incidence of central nervous system toxicity among divers has decreased since the Second World War, as protocols have developed to limit exposure and partial pressure of oxygen inspired. In 1947, Donald recommended limiting the depth allowed for breathing pure oxygen to {{convert|7.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}, or a pp{{chem|O|2}} of {{convert|1.8|bar|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Donald, Part II|1947}} This limit has been reduced, until today a limit of {{convert|1.4|bar|abbr=on}} during a recreational dive and {{convert|1.6|bar|abbr=on}} during shallow decompression stops is accepted. Oxygen toxicity has now become a rare occurrence other than when caused by equipment malfunction and human error. Historically, the U.S. Navy has refined its Navy Diving Manual Tables to reduce oxygen toxicity incidents. Between 1995 and 1999, reports showed 405 surface-supported dives using the helium–oxygen tables; of these, oxygen toxicity symptoms were observed on 6 dives (1.5%). As a result, the U.S. Navy in 2000 modified the schedules and conducted field tests of 150 dives, none of which produced symptoms of oxygen toxicity. Revised tables were published in 2001.<ref name="Gerth" />

The variability in tolerance and other variable factors such as workload have resulted in the U.S. Navy abandoning screening for oxygen tolerance. Of the 6,250 oxygen-tolerance tests performed between 1976 and 1997, only 6 episodes of oxygen toxicity were observed (0.1%).<ref name="Gould" /><ref name="pmid3705251" />

Central nervous system oxygen toxicity among patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy is rare, and is influenced by a number of a factors: individual sensitivity and treatment protocol; and probably [[Indication (medicine)|therapy indication]] and equipment used. A study by Welslau in 1996 reported 16 incidents out of a population of 107,264 patients (0.015%), while Hampson and Atik in 2003 found a rate of 0.03%.<ref name="pmid15485078" /><ref name="pmid12964858" /> Yildiz, Ay and Qyrdedi, in a summary of 36,500 patient treatments between 1996 and 2003, reported only 3 oxygen toxicity incidents, giving a rate of 0.008%.<ref name="pmid15485078" /> A later review of over 80,000 patient treatments revealed an even lower rate: 0.0024%. The reduction in incidence may be partly due to use of a mask (rather than a hood) to deliver oxygen.<ref name="pmid15559001" />

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is among the most common complications of [[Premature birth|prematurely born]] infants and its incidence has grown as the survival of extremely premature infants has increased. Nevertheless, the severity has decreased as better management of supplemental oxygen has resulted in the disease now being related mainly to factors other than hyperoxia.<ref name="Bancalari" />

In 1997 a summary of studies of neonatal intensive care units in industrialised countries showed that up to 60% of [[low birth weight]] babies developed retinopathy of prematurity, which rose to 72% in extremely low birth weight babies, defined as less than {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} at birth. However, severe outcomes are much less frequent: for very low birth weight babies—those less than {{convert|1.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} at birth—the incidence of blindness was found to be no more than 8%.<ref name="Gilbert" />

== History ==

[[File:Paul Bert.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Paul Bert, a French physiologist, first described oxygen toxicity in 1878. |alt=Photograph of a man, with receding hairline and grey moustache. He is dressed in a formal jacket and waistcoat, typical of Victorian fashion.]]

Central nervous system toxicity was first described by [[Paul Bert]] in 1878.<ref name="Bert" /><ref name="BSAC" /> He showed that oxygen was toxic to insects, [[arachnids]], [[Myriapoda|myriapods]], molluscs, earthworms, fungi, germinating seeds, birds, and other animals. Central nervous system toxicity may be referred to as the "Paul Bert effect".<ref name="Patel" />

Pulmonary oxygen toxicity was first described by J. Lorrain Smith in 1899 when he noted central nervous system toxicity and discovered in experiments in mice and birds that {{convert|0.43|bar|abbr=on}} had no effect but {{convert|0.75|bar|abbr=on}} of oxygen was a pulmonary irritant.<ref name="Smith" /> Pulmonary toxicity may be referred to as the "Lorrain Smith effect".<ref name="Patel" /> The first recorded human exposure was undertaken in 1910 by Bornstein when two men breathed oxygen at {{convert|2.8|bar|abbr=on}} for 30&nbsp;minutes while he went on to 48&nbsp;minutes with no symptoms. In 1912, Bornstein developed cramps in his hands and legs while breathing oxygen at {{convert|2.8|bar|abbr=on}} for 51&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="Acott" /> Smith then went on to show that intermittent exposure to a breathing gas with less oxygen permitted the lungs to recover and delayed the onset of pulmonary toxicity.<ref name="Smith" />

[[Albert R. Behnke]] ''et al.'' in 1935 were the first to observe [[visual field]] contraction ([[tunnel vision]]) on dives between {{convert|1.0|bar|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4.1|bar|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Behnke Johnson" /><ref name="Behnke Forbes" /> During World War II, Donald and Yarbrough ''et al.'' performed over 2,000 experiments on oxygen toxicity to support the initial use of closed circuit oxygen [[rebreather]]s.<ref name="NEDU47" />{{sfn|Donald|1992}} Naval divers in the early years of [[oxygen rebreather]] diving developed a mythology about a monster called "Oxygen Pete", who lurked in the bottom of the Admiralty Experimental Diving Unit "wet pot" (a water-filled [[hyperbaric chamber]]) to catch unwary divers. They called having an oxygen toxicity attack "getting a Pete".<ref name="pete" /><ref name="davis1955" />

In the decade following World War II, [[Christian J. Lambertsen|Lambertsen]] ''et al.'' made further discoveries on the effects of breathing oxygen under pressure as well as methods of prevention.<ref name="Penn" /><ref name="Vann 2004" /> Their work on intermittent exposures for extension of oxygen tolerance and on a model for prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity based on pulmonary function are key documents in the development of [[standard operating procedure]]s when breathing elevated pressures of oxygen.{{sfn|Clark|Lambertsen|1970|p=}} Lambertsen's work showing the effect of carbon dioxide in decreasing time to onset of central nervous system symptoms has influenced work from current exposure [[guidelines]] to future [[Scuba set|breathing apparatus]] design.<ref name="rebreather2.0" /><ref name="padi" />{{sfn|Lang|2001|pp=81–6}}

Retinopathy of prematurity was not observed prior to World War II, but with the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly became one of the principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in retinopathy of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions and problems of retinopathy of prematurity.<ref name="Gilbert" />

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was first described by Northway in 1967, who outlined the conditions that would lead to the diagnosis.<ref name="pmid5334613" /> This was later expanded by Bancalari and in 1988 by Shennan, who suggested the need for supplemental oxygen at 36&nbsp;weeks could predict long-term outcomes.<ref name="pmid3174313" /> Nevertheless, Palta ''et al.'' in 1998 concluded that [[radiographic]] evidence was the most accurate predictor of long-term effects.<ref name="pmid9470001" />

Bitterman ''et al.'' in 1986 and 1995 showed that [[Lighting|darkness]] and [[caffeine]] would delay the onset of changes to [[electroencephalography|brain electrical activity]] in rats.<ref name="pmid3705247" /><ref name="pmid8574677" /> In the years since, research on central nervous system toxicity has centred on methods of prevention and safe extension of tolerance.<ref name="natoliMS" /> Sensitivity to central nervous system oxygen toxicity has been shown to be affected by factors such as [[circadian rhythm]], drugs, age, and gender.<ref name="pmid5130131" /><ref name="pmid15622741" /><ref name="pmid5061633" /><ref name="pmid17672171" /> In 1988, Hamilton ''et al.'' wrote procedures for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish oxygen exposure limits for [[Underwater habitat|habitat]] operations.<ref name="repex1" /><ref name="repex2" /><ref name="spums" /> Even today, models for the prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity do not explain all the results of exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen.<ref name="Shykoff2007" />

== Society and culture ==

{{see also|Nitrox|Oxygen bar}}

[[Recreational diving|Recreational scuba divers]] commonly breathe [[nitrox]] containing up to 40% oxygen, while [[Technical diving|technical divers]] use pure oxygen or nitrox containing up to 80% oxygen. Divers who breathe oxygen fractions greater than in air (21%) need to be trained in the dangers of oxygen toxicity and how to prevent them.{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=195}} In order to buy nitrox, a diver has to show evidence of such qualification.<ref name="BSACnitrox" />

Since the late 1990s the recreational use of oxygen has been promoted by oxygen bars, where customers breathe oxygen through a [[nasal cannula]]. Claims have been made that this reduces stress, increases energy, and lessens the effects of hangovers and headaches, despite the lack of any scientific evidence to support them.<ref name="Bren" /> There are also devices on sale that offer "oxygen massage" and "oxygen detoxification" with claims of removing body toxins and reducing body fat.<ref name="o2planet" /> The [[American Lung Association]] has stated "there is no evidence that oxygen at the low flow levels used in bars can be dangerous to a normal person's health", but the U.S. [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] cautions that people with heart or lung disease need their supplementary oxygen carefully regulated and should not use oxygen bars.<ref name="Bren" />

Victorian society had a fascination for the rapidly expanding field of science. In "[[Dr. Ox's Experiment]]", a short story written by [[Jules Verne]] in 1872, the eponymous doctor uses [[electrolysis of water]] to separate oxygen and hydrogen. He then pumps the pure oxygen throughout the town of Quiquendone, causing the normally tranquil inhabitants and their animals to become aggressive and plants to grow rapidly. An explosion of the hydrogen and oxygen in Dr Ox's factory brings his experiment to an end. Verne summarised his story by explaining that the effects of oxygen described in the tale were his own invention.<ref name="Verne Dr Ox" /> There is also a brief episode of oxygen intoxication in his "[[From the Earth to the Moon]]".<ref name="Verne 1877" />
