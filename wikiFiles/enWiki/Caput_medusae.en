'''Caput medusae''' is the appearance of distended and engorged [[paraumbilical veins]], which are seen radiating from the [[Navel|umbilicus]] across the abdomen to join [[systemic vein]]s. The name ''caput medusae'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "head of Medusa") originates from the apparent similarity to [[Medusa]]'s hair once [[Athena]] had turned it into snakes {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

The [[umbilical vein]] carries oxygenated blood from mother to fetus in utero, and normally closes within one week of birth. In portal hypertension, the umbilical vein can become re-canalized.

==Differential diagnosis==
===Inferior vena cava obstruction===
*Produces [[abdominal]] [[collateral veins]] to bypass the blocked inferior vena cava and permit venous return from the [[leg]]s.

====How to differentiate====
Determine the direction of flow in the veins below the umbilicus. After pushing down on the prominent vein, blood will:
*Caput Medusae - flow is towards the legs
*Inferior vena cava obstruction - flow is towards the head.
