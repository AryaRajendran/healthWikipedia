An '''air ioniser''' (or '''negative ion generator''') is a device that uses [[high voltage]] to [[ionization|ionise]] (electrically charge) air [[molecule]]s. Negative ions, or [[anions]], are particles with one or more extra [[electron]]s, conferring a net negative charge to the particle.  [[Cations]] are positive ions missing one or more electrons, resulting in a net positive charge. Most commercial air purifiers are designed to generate negative ions. Another type of air ioniser is the ESD ioniser (balanced ion generator) used to neutralise static charge.

Russian scientist and inventor [[Alexander Chizhevsky]] produced the so-called ''Chizhevsky Chandelier'' around 1918. This was the first modern air ioniser.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Ionic air purifiers ==
[[File:Air ionizer and collection plate.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|Air ioniser and purifier with its dust collection plates removed]]

Air ionisers are used in  [[air purifier]]s. Airborne particles are attracted to the electrode in an effect similar to static electricity. These ions are de-ionised by seeking earthed conductors, such as walls and ceilings. To increase the efficiency of this process, some commercial products provide such surfaces within the device. 
The frequency of [[nosocomial infection]]s in British hospitals prompted the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) to research the effectiveness of anions for air purification.<ref name="scientist">

The [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] Pandemic fuelled the desire for personal ionisers in the Far East, including [[Japan]] (where many products have been specialised to contain negative ion generators, including [[toothbrush]]es, [[refrigerator]]s, air conditioners, air cleaners and [[washing machine]]s). There are no specific standards for these devices. Notebook producer [[ASUS]] included an integrated air ioniser in the N51Vf laptop.<ref>http://www.asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID=0Tc42s23bOdbbvY5</ref>

== Ions versus ozone ==

Ionisers should not be confused with [[ozone generator]]s, even though both devices operate in a similar way. Ionisers use electrostatically charged plates to produce positively or negatively charged gas ions (for instance N<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> or O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>) that particulate matter sticks to in an effect similar to [[static electricity]]. Ozone generators are optimised to attract an extra oxygen ion to an O<sub>2</sub> molecule, using either a [[corona discharge|corona discharge tube]] or [[UV light]].
Even the best ionisers will produce a small amount of ozone.<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/21/health/he-skeptic21</ref>

At high concentrations, ozone can also be [[toxic]] to air-borne [[bacterium|bacteria]], and may destroy or kill these sometimes infectious organisms.  However, the needed concentrations are toxic enough to humans and animals that the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in the [[United States]] explicitly demands [[ozone therapy]] not be used as medical treatment,<ref name="medical devices">

== ''Consumer Reports'' court case ==
''[[Consumer Reports]]'', a non-profit U.S.-based product-testing magazine, reported in October 2003 that air ionisers do not perform to high enough standards compared to conventional [[HEPA]] filters. The exception was a combination unit that used a fan to move air while ionizing it.  In response to this report, [[The Sharper Image]], a manufacturer of air ionisers (among other products), sued Consumer's Union (the publishers of ''Consumer Reports'') for product defamation. Consumer Reports gave the Ionic Breeze and other popular units a "fail" because they have a low [[Clean Air Delivery Rate]] (CADR). CADR measures the amount of filtered air circulated during a short period of time, and was originally designed to rate media-based air cleaners. The Sharper Image claimed that this test was a poor way to rate the Ionic Breeze, since it does not take into account other features, such as 24-hour a day continuous cleaning, ease of maintenance, and silent operation. The [[U.S. District Court]] for the Northern District of California subsequently struck down The Sharper Image's complaint and dismissed the case, reasoning that The Sharper Image had failed to demonstrate that it could prove any of the statements made by ''Consumer Reports'' were false. The Court's final ruling in May 2005 ordered The Sharper Image to pay US$ 525,000 for Consumer Union's legal expenses.<ref name="consumer">
