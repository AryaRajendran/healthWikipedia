==History==
Tenet was founded in 1967 by three lawyers: Richard Eamer, Leonard Cohen and John Bedrosian and originally named National Medical Enterprises (NME) and originally headquartered in Los Angeles, California. The company spent its first decade building and acquiring medical facilities and related services. The company began seven construction projects in 1971, tripling in size within a year. In the mid-1980s, NME shifted its focus to specialty hospitals. After some scandals in the early 1990s (see below), NME unloaded its specialty facilities, reconfiguring itself as Tenet Healthcare Corporation in 1995, and again turned its focus to acute care. Tenet dominated the southern California market, and sought a foothold in south Florida, Louisiana and Texas, as well as the Philadelphia area. Eventually, Tenet owned 111 hospitals. In 2002, however, the company became entangled in scandals, as one of its hospitals came under scrutiny for its surgical practices and another was investigated in a [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]] scheme (see below).<ref>[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10570319/1/best-in-class-why-tenet-is-the-healthiest-play-in-hospitals.html Best in Class: Why Tenet Is the Healthiest Play in Hospitals]</ref> In 2003, Trevor Fetter became CEO and started the Commitment to Quality that same year, an initiative that included improvements in data gathering and statistics.<ref>[http://www.sbnonline.com/Local/Article/17647/71/0/Deep_healing.aspx Deep healing: How Trevor Fetter turned around Tenet Healthcare]</ref> The company also hired a chief compliance officer to rebuild its ethics and compliance programs.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/aug/05/business/fi-tenet5 Tenet Moves to Beef Up Compliance]</ref> In 2004, Tenet also moved its headquarters from California to the northern suburban areas of Dallas.  To improve its reputation, Tenet retained former Florida governor [[Jeb Bush]] to its board of directors in 2007.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1231662320070412 Jeb Bush joins board of Tenet Healthcare]</ref> Detailed financial reports on Tenet's patient mix, collection rates and accounts receivables that are required by the company as a condition of the 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services<ref name="oig.hhs.gov">[http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/cia/agreements/TenetCIAFinal.pdf Corporate Integrity Agreement Final Document]</ref><ref name="tenethealth.com">[http://www.tenethealth.com/News/Documents/2006%20Press%20Releases/Tenet%20Enters%20Into%20Five-Year%20Corporate%20Integrity%20Agreement.pdf Tenet Enters Into Five-Year Corporate Integrity Agreement]</ref> have improved the company's transparency. As of 2009, the company has begun to turn around, with an operating revenue and net profit of $9 billion and $181 million, respectively.  In 2009, Tenet stock became the number 2 performer on the S&P 500 after decreasing earlier in the year because of higher than average debt.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/2010-01-04-stocks-revived-in-2009_N.htm USA Today 1/4/10]</ref> The company's largest hospital is Brookwood Medical Center located in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]] with almost 600 beds.

==Controversies==
===Psychiatric fraud===
In the early 1990s as National Medical Enterprises, the company was accused of committing fraud by admitting thousands of psychiatric patients who did not need hospitalization and then charging these patients inflated prices.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/31/business/8-big-insurers-sue-national-medical-enterprises.html?pagewanted=1 New York Times 7/31/92]</ref> In 1991, the federal government investigated the company for fraud and conspiracy.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/08/business/company-news-us-investigating-national-medical.html?pagewanted=1 New York Times 10/8/91]</ref> In 1993, offices of the company were raided by law enforcement in an attempt to show that the company was defrauding patients and insurance companies.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/27/business/us-raids-hospital-operator.html?pagewanted=1 New York Times 8/27/93]</ref> In 1994, the company paid $2.5 million to settle lawsuits from 23 patients at its psychiatric hospitals.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/09/business/national-medical-settlement.html?pagewanted=1 New York Times 3/9/94]</ref> Again in 1994, National Medical Enterprises settled fraud charges with the United States and 28 states involving payments of a record $380 million USD at the time and federal guilty pleas on eight criminal counts by two of its units. The company also agreed to a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the [[U.S. Department of Health|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]].<ref>[http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/94/6/913 PEDIATRICS Vol. 94 No. 6 December 1994]</ref>

===Unnecessary heart surgeries===
In the late 1990s through the early 2000s, [[Redding Medical Center]] (a former Tenet hospital), was investigated for carrying out unnecessary heart surgeries on over 600 patients. To settle these allegations, Tenet agreed to pay a $54 million USD fine to the federal government and the state of California, without admitting wrongdoing.<ref name="usatoday">[http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2003-08-06-tenet-settlement_x.htm USA Today 8/6/03]</ref> This settlement did not preclude civil or criminal charges against individuals of the company.<ref name="usatoday"/> In order for the hospital to continue receiving Medicare, Tenet was compelled by federal regulators to sell the hospital and it was subsequently renamed [[Shasta Regional Medical Center (Redding, California)|Shasta Regional Medical Center]].<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115480370.html Tenet Healthcare Agrees to Sell Redding, Calif., Medical Center]</ref> In 2004, Tenet paid an additional $395 million USD to 769 patients to settle litigation for the unnecessary surgeries.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9E05E4DE1030F931A15751C1A9629C8B63 New York Times 12/22/04]</ref> The scandal and subsequent federal investigation are described in the book ''Coronary: A True Story of Medicine Gone Awry'' by author [[Stephen Klaidman]].

===Medicare fraud===
In June 2006, Tenet agreed to pay $725 million in cash and give up $175 million of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] payments for a total of $900 million USD in fees to resolve claims it defrauded the federal government for over-billing Medicare claims during the 1990s. To finance the settlement, they sold 11 hospitals in four states including [[Ochsner Baptist Medical Center|Memorial Medical Center (see below)]].<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601202&sid=aXyMRajt9v38&refer=healthcare Tenet Healthcare Wins Dismissal of Racketeering Suit]</ref><ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/46409.php Tenet Healthcare To Sell 11 Hospitals To Help Cover Cost Of Settlement]</ref><ref>[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2006/June/06_civ_406.html Tenet Healthcare Corporation to Pay U.S.  more than $900 Million to Resolve False Claims Act Allegations]</ref> In September of that year, Tenet entered into a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the [[U.S. Department of Health|U.S. Department of Health & Human Services]].<ref name="oig.hhs.gov"/><ref name="tenethealth.com"/> That agreement expired on September 27, 2011.

===Hurricane Katrina===
In 2006, Dr. Anna Pou and nurses Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, who worked at [[Ochsner Baptist Medical Center|Memorial Medical Center]] (a hospital owned at the time by Tenet Healthcare), in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], had been taken from their homes late at night in a highly publicized arrest on charges of second-degree murder in the deaths of four patients by Louisiana Attorney General [[Charles Foti]].<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/03/11/katrina.hospital.deaths/index.html?hpt=T2 Coroner: Post-Katrina hospital death not homicide]</ref> In August 2007, a New Orleans grand jury declined to indict the three women. After the grand jury declined to return charges, a New Orleans judge expunged the women's arrest records. Dr. Pou sued Foti for defamation and damage to her career.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/magazine/30doctors.html The Deadly Choices at Memorial]</ref> In June 2006, Tenet announced that they planned to sell Memorial Medical Center and three other hospitals in the greater New Orleans area.<ref>[http://www.wdsu.com/news/9446265/detail.html Four Area Hospitals For Sale] June 29, 2006</ref>

===Tax dodging and lobbying===
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization [[Public Campaign#Reports|Public Campaign]] criticized '''Tenet Healthcare''' for spending $3.43 million on [[lobbying]] and [[tax avoidance|not paying any taxes]] during 2008-2010, instead getting $48 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $415 million, and increasing executive pay by 19% to $24 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives.<ref>{{cite web|last=Portero|first=Ashley|title=30 Major U.S. Corporations Paid More to Lobby Congress Than Income Taxes, 2008-2010|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/264481/20111209/30-major-u-s-corporations-paid-lobby.htm|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|accessdate=26 December 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64D9GyQG0|archivedate=26 December 2011}}</ref>
