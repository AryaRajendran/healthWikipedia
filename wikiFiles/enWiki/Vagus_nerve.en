{{Cranial nerves short}}

The '''vagus nerve''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|v|eɪ|ɡ|ə|s}} {{Respell|VAY|gəs}}), also called '''pneumogastric nerve''' or '''cranial nerve X''', is the tenth of twelve (excluding [[CN0]]) paired [[cranial nerves]]. Upon leaving the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] between the [[pyramid of medulla oblongata|medullary pyramid]] and the [[inferior cerebellar peduncle]], it extends through the [[jugular foramen]], then passes into the [[carotid sheath]] between the [[internal carotid artery]] and the [[internal jugular vein]] down below the [[head (anatomy)|head]], to the neck, chest and [[abdomen]], where it contributes to the [[innervation of the viscera]]. Besides output to the various organs in the body, the vagus nerve conveys [[sense|sensory]] information about the state of the body's organs to the [[central nervous system]]. 80-90% of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerve are [[afferent nerves|afferent]] (sensory) nerves communicating the state of the viscera to the brain.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VT5-41TN409-2&_user=10&_coverDate=12%2F20%2F2000&_rdoc=2&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236281%232000%23999149998%23220094%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=6281&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_ct=23&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=540993eae7f65c7a08bcabc6693627c1 Functional and chemical anatomy of the afferent vagal system.

The medieval [[Latin]] word ''vagus'' means literally "wandering" (the words ''[[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]'', ''[[vagabond (person)|vagabond]]'', and ''[[vague]]'' come from the same root). Sometimes the branches are spoken of in the plural and are thus called '''vagi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|eɪ|dʒ|aɪ}}, {{USdict|vā′·jī}}). The vagus is also called the ''pneumogastric'' nerve since it innervates both the lungs and the stomach.

The [[motor system|motor]] division of the vagus nerve is derived from the [[Basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]] of the [[embryo]]nic [[medulla oblongata]], while the [[sensory system|sensory]] division originates from the [[cranial neural crest]]. 

The vagus nerve includes [[axon]]s which emerge from or converge onto four [[cranial nerve nucleus|nuclei]] of the medulla:
# The [[Dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve]] - which sends [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] output to the viscera, especially the intestines
# The [[Nucleus ambiguus]] - which gives rise to the branchial efferent motor fibers of the vagus nerve and preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that innervate the heart
# The [[Solitary nucleus]] - which receives afferent taste information and primary afferents from visceral organs
# The [[Spinal trigeminal nucleus]] - which receives information about deep/crude touch, pain, and temperature of the outer ear, the dura of the posterior cranial fossa and the mucosa of the larynx

== Branches ==
* [[Auricular nerve]]
* [[Pharyngeal branch of vagus nerve|Pharyngeal nerve]]
* [[Superior laryngeal nerve]]
* [[Superior cervical cardiac branches of vagus nerve]]
* [[Inferior cervical cardiac branch]]
* [[Recurrent laryngeal nerve]]
* Thoracic cardiac branches
* Branches to the [[pulmonary plexus]]
* Branches to the [[esophageal plexus]]
* [[Anterior vagal trunk]]
* [[Posterior vagal trunk]]
* [[Hering-Breuer reflex]] in alveoli
The vagus runs posterior to the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein inside the carotid sheath.

== Innervation ==
Right and left vagus nerves descend from the cranial vault through the jugular foramina, penetrating the [[carotid sheath]] between the internal and external carotid arteries, then passing posterolateral to the common carotid artery.  The cell bodies of [[General visceral afferent fibers|visceral afferent]] fibers of the vagus nerve are located bilaterally in the [[inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve]] (nodose ganglia).
[[File:Internal carotid artery.jpg|thumb|Vagus nerve - dissection]]
The right vagus nerve gives rise to the right recurrent laryngeal nerve, which hooks around the right subclavian artery and ascends into the neck between the trachea and esophagus.  The right vagus then crosses anteriorly to the right subclavian artery and runs posterior to the superior vena cava and descends posterior to the right main bronchus and contributes to cardiac, pulmonary, and esophageal plexuses. It forms the posterior vagal [[Nerve trunk|trunk]] at the lower part of the esophagus and enters the diaphragm through the esophageal hiatus. 

The left vagus nerve enters the thorax between left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery and descends on the aortic arch. It gives rise to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, which hooks around the aortic arch to the left of the ligamentum arteriosum and ascends between the trachea and esophagus.  The left vagus further gives off thoracic cardiac branches, breaks up into pulmonary plexus, continues into the esophageal plexus, and enters the abdomen as the anterior vagal trunk in the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm.

The vagus nerve supplies motor [[parasympathetic]] fibers to all the organs except the suprarenal ([[adrenal]]) glands, from the [[neck]] down to the second segment of the [[colon (anatomy)|transverse colon]]. The vagus also controls a few [[skeletal muscle]]s, notable ones being:
* [[Cricothyroid muscle]]
* [[Levator veli palatini muscle]]
* [[Salpingopharyngeus muscle]]
* [[Palatoglossus muscle]]
* [[Palatopharyngeus muscle]]
* Superior, middle and inferior [[pharyngeal constrictor]]s
* Muscles of the [[larynx]] ([[Speech communication|speech]]).

This means that the vagus nerve is responsible for such varied tasks as [[heart rate]], gastrointestinal [[peristalsis]], [[sweating]], and quite a few muscle movements in the mouth, including [[Speech communication|speech]] (via the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]]) and keeping the larynx open for breathing (via action of the [[posterior cricoarytenoid muscle]], the only abductor of the vocal folds). It also has some afferent fibers that innervate the inner (canal) portion of the [[outer ear]], via the Auricular branch (also known as [[Alderman's nerve]]) and part of the [[meninges]]. This explains why a person may cough when tickled on the ear (such as when trying to remove ear wax with a cotton swab).

== The vagus nerve and the heart ==
[[Image:Sinoatrial node high mag.jpg|thumb|200px|Fibers of the '''vagus nerve''' (right/bottom of image) innervate the [[sinoatrial node]] tissue (central and left of image). [[H&E stain]].]]
[[Parasympathetic]] innervation of the [[heart]] is controlled by the vagus nerve. To be specific, the vagus nerve acts to lower the [[heart rate]]. The right vagus innervates the [[SA node|sinoatrial node]]. Parasympathetic hyperstimulation predisposes those affected to [[bradyarrhythmias]]. The left vagus when hyperstimulated predisposes the heart to [[Heart block|atrioventricular (AV) blocks]].

At this location, neuroscientist [[Otto Loewi]] first demonstrated that nerves secrete substances called [[neurotransmitters]], which have effects on receptors in target tissues. In his experiment, Loewi electrically stimulated the vagus nerve of a frog heart, which slowed the heart. Then he took the fluid from the heart and transferred it to a second frog heart without a vagus nerve. The second heart slowed down without an electrical stimulation. Loewi described the substance released by the vagus nerve as [[vagusstoff]], which was later found to be [[acetylcholine]]. 
Drugs that inhibit the muscarinic cholinergic receptor (anticholinergics) such as [[atropine]] and [[scopolamine]] are called vagolytic because they inhibit the action of the vagus nerve on the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs.  Anticholinergic drugs increase heart rate and are used to treat [[bradycardia]] (slow heart rate). Atropine is no longer indicated for the treatment of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole per the 2010 ACLS guidelines, as it has not been shown to improve outcomes in these clinical scenarios.

== Medical treatment involving the vagus nerve ==
[[Vagus nerve stimulation]] (VNS) therapy using a pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest is a treatment used since 1997 to control [[seizure]]s in epilepsy patients and has recently been approved for treating drug-resistant cases of [[clinical depression]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nemeroff C, Mayberg H, Krahl S, McNamara J, Frazer A, Henry T, George M, Charney D, Brannan S | title = VNS therapy in treatment-resistant depression: clinical evidence and putative neurobiological mechanisms. | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 31 | issue = 7 | pages = 1345–55 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16641939 | doi = 10.1038/sj.npp.1301082}} [http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v31/n7/abs/1301082a.html link]</ref> A non-invasive VNS device that stimulates an afferent branch of the vagus nerve is also being developed and will soon undergo trials.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Clinical trials are currently underway in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]] using VNS for the treatment of tonal [[tinnitus]] after a breakthrough study published in early 2011 by researchers at the [[University of Texas - Dallas]] showed successful [[tinnitus]] suppression in rats when tones were paired with brief pulses of stimulation of the vagus nerve.<ref>[http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2011/1/13-8021_Findings-Show-Promise-in-Battle-Against-Tinnitus_article.html]</ref>

VNS may also be achieved by one of the ''vagal maneuvers'': holding the breath for a few seconds, dipping the face in cold water, coughing, or tensing the stomach muscles as if to bear down to have a bowel movement.<ref name="vagal">{{cite web | last = Vibhuti N | first = Singh | coauthors = Monika Gugneja | title = Supraventricular Tachycardia | work = eMedicineHealth.com | date = 2005-08-22 | url = http://www.emedicinehealth.com/supraventricular_tachycardia/page7_em.htm | accessdate = 2008-11-28}}</ref>  Patients with [[supraventricular tachycardia]],<ref name="vagal"/> [[atrial fibrillation]], and other illnesses may be trained to perform vagal maneuvers (or find one or more on their own).

Vagus nerve blocking (VBLOC) therapy is similar to VNS but used only during the day.  In a six-month [[open-label trial]] involving three medical centers in Australia, Mexico, and Norway, vagus nerve blocking has helped 31 obese participants lose an average of nearly 15 percent of their excess weight.  A year-long 300-participant [[Blind_experiment#Double-blind_trials|double-blind]], [[Clinical_trial#Phase_II|phase II]] trial has begun.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.org/news2008-rst/4892.html Mayo Clinic. Device Blocking Stomach Nerve Signals Shows Promise in Obesity]</ref>

[[Vagotomy]] (cutting of the vagus nerve) is a now-obsolete therapy that was performed for peptic ulcer disease.  Vagotomy is currently being researched as a less invasive alternative weight-loss procedure to [[gastric bypass surgery]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19563617/ Ulcer surgery may help treat obesity - Diet and nutrition - MSNBC.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The procedure curbs the feeling of hunger and is sometimes performed in conjunction with putting bands on patients' stomachs, resulting in average weight loss of 43% at six months with diet and exercise.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/07/09/obesity.nerve.ap/index.html | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

One serious side-effect of a vagotomy is a [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] deficiency later in life - i.e., 10 years - that is similar to [[pernicious anemia]].  The vagus normally stimulates the stomach's parietal cells to secrete acid and intrinsic factor. [[Intrinsic factor]] is needed to absorb vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from food.  The vagotomy reduces this secretion and ultimately leads to the deficiency, which, if left untreated, causes nerve damage, tiredness, dementia, paranoia, and ultimately death.<ref>http://www.pernicious-anaemia-society.org</ref>

== Physical and emotional effects ==
Activation of the vagus nerve typically leads to a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, or both. This occurs commonly in the setting of gastrointestinal illness such as viral gastroenteritis or acute cholecystitis, or in response to other stimuli, including [[carotid sinus]] massage, [[Valsalva maneuver]], or [[pain]] from any cause, in particular, having blood drawn. When the circulatory changes are great enough, [[vasovagal syncope]] results. Relative dehydration tends to amplify these responses. Symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome are thought to cause activation of the vagus nerve with many people reporting fainting, vision disturbances and dizziness, but there has been little research into this area as it is not deemed necessary and/or life threatening. 

Excessive activation of the vagal nerve during emotional stress, which is a parasympathetic overcompensation of a strong sympathetic nervous system response associated with stress, can also cause [[vasovagal syncope]] because of a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate. Vasovagal syncope affects young children and women more than other groups. It can also lead to temporary loss of bladder control under moments of extreme fear.

Research has shown that women having had complete [[spinal cord injury]] can experience [[orgasm]]s through the vagus nerve, which can go from the [[uterus]], [[cervix]], and, it is presumed, the [[vagina]] to the brain.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/01/72325 | work=Wired | title=Exploring the Mind-Body Orgasm | date=2007-01-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Komisaruk, B.R, [[Whipple, B.]], Crawford, A., Grimes, S., Liu, W-C., Kalin, A., & Mosier, K. | title = Brain activation during vaginocervical self-stimulation and orgasm in women with complete spinal cord injury: MRI evidence of mediation by the Vagus nerves | year = 2004 }} [http://psychology.rutgers.edu/~brk/brainresearch04.pdf]</ref>

Liver - Insulin signaling activates the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the [[Arcuate nucleus]], decreases AgRP release, and through the vagus nerve, leads to decreased glucose production by the liver by decreasing gluconeogenic enzymes: [[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]], [[Glucose 6-phosphatase]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pocai|first=A|coauthors=TK Lam, Gutierrez-Juarez R|title=Hypothalamic K(ATP) channels control hepatic glucose production|journal=Nature|year=2005|volume=434|pages=1026–1031 | doi = 10.1038/nature03439}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Pagotto|first=U.|title=Where does insulin resistance start? The brain.|journal=Diabetes Care|year=2009|volume=32|issue=2|pages=S174-S177}}</ref>

== Effects of vagus nerve lesions ==
The patient complains of hoarse voice, difficulty in swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), and choking when drinking fluid. There is also loss of gag reflex. [[Uvula]] deviates away from the side of lesion, and there is failure of [[palate]] elevation.
