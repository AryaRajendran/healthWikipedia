'''Auspitz's sign''' is the appearance of punctate bleeding spots when [[psoriasis]] scales are scraped off, named after [[Heinrich Auspitz]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|101|Auspitz' symptom}}</ref>This happens because there is thinning of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermal layer]] overlying the tips of the [[dermal papilla]]e and blood vessels within the papillae are dilated and tortuous, which bleed readily when the scale is removed. <ref name=Robbins>{{cite book|last=Kumar et al|title=Robbin's Text book of Pathology|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-312-1036-9|pages=841}}</ref>
