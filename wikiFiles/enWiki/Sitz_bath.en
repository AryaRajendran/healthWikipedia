A '''sitz bath''' or '''hip bath''' is a bath in which a person sits in water up to the [[hip]]s. It is used to relieve discomfort and pain in the lower part of the body, for example, due to [[hemorrhoid]]s (piles), [[anal fissure]]s, [[rectum|rectal]] surgery, an [[episiotomy]], [[uterus|uterine]] [[cramp]]s, [[inflammatory bowel disease]], and infections of the [[bladder]], [[prostate]] or [[vagina]]. It works by keeping the affected area clean and increasing the flow of blood to it.

A sitz bath may be created simply by filling a bathtub with some water and sitting in it for a few minutes. Alternatively, a large basin can be used. There are also special devices that fit into toilet bowls. Sitz baths may either be warm or cool. Some people find alternating between hot and cold water soothing. Sitz baths may be filled with just water, or substances such as salt, baking soda or vinegar can be added.

==Origin of term==
The term ''sitz bath'' is derived from the German word ''Sitzbad'',<ref name=OED>{{citation|contribution=sitz bath, ''n.''|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED Online]]|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1989|accessdate=17 February 2011}}.</ref> meaning a bath (''Bad'') in which one sits (''sitzen''). A sitz bath is a hip-bath, that is, a bath in which a person sits covered with water up to the [[hip]]s.<ref name=OED/> Hip baths were originally a European custom,<ref name=Gale>{{citation|author=Karen Boyden|author2=Donna Olendorf|author3=Christine Jeryan|contribution=sitz bath|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/sitz+bath|title=The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine (reproduced on [[TheFreeDictionary.com]])|location=Detroit, Mich.|publisher=Gale Research Co.|year=2008|accessdate=17 February 2011}}.</ref> although nowadays sitz baths are used mainly for therapeutic purposes.

==Uses==
Sitz baths are used to relieve discomfort and pain in the lower part of the body, for example, as a result of [[hemorrhoid]]s (piles), [[anal fissure]]s,<ref>{{citation|author=Elizabeth Breen|author2=Ronald Bleday|title=Patient information: Anal fissure|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-information-anal-fissure#H5|publisher=[[UpToDate]]|date=September 2010|accessdate=17 February 2011}}.</ref> [[rectum|rectal]] surgery, an [[episiotomy]],<ref>{{citation|author=David C.

==Preparation==
Sitz baths may either be warm or cool. Warm baths are recommended for reducing the itching, pain and discomfort associated with conditions such as hemorrhoids and genital problems. An ordinary bathtub can be filled with {{convert|3|to|4|in|cm}} of hot water (about {{convert|110|F|C}}), and sat in for 15–20 minutes or until the water cools down.<ref name=Gale/> Alternatively, a large basin can be used, and there are specially built devices that fit into toilet bowls.<ref>{{citation|author=Parswa Ansari|author2=Norman Sohn|title=Hemorrhoids (Piles)|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec09/ch130/ch130g.html#sec09-ch130-ch130b-766|publisher=The Merck Manuals Online Medical Library, [[Merck & Co.]]|date=October 2007|accessdate=17 February 2011}}.</ref>

Cool sitz baths are said to be helpful in easing [[constipation]], [[inflammation]] and [[vaginal discharge]]s, and, in cases of [[fecal incontinence|fecal]] or [[urinary incontinence]], in toning the muscles.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Some people find that alternating three to five times between a hot bath for 3–4 minutes and an ice-cold bath for 30–60 seconds is soothing. A towel soaked in cold water can be used in place of a cold bath.<ref name=Gale/>

For most purposes sitz baths with water are sufficient, though some people prefer to use [[saline water]] or water mixed with [[baking soda]]. The use of such additives helps to reduce infections. Women with [[candidiasis]] (a vaginal yeast infection) may benefit from a warm bath with salt and vinegar.<ref name=Gale/>

==Risks==
Sitz baths are considered very low risk, but the patient is at risk for drowning. However, because hot baths cause blood vessels to dilate, on rare occasions some people can feel dizzy or have [[palpitation]]s (rapid or abnormal heartbeat).<ref name=Gale/> Individuals prone to such occurrences are advised to have someone standing by to assist them.
