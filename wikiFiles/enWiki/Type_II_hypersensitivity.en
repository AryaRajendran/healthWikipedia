In '''type II hypersensitivity''' (or '''cytotoxic hypersensitivity''')<ref name="urlHypersensitivity reactions">{{cite web |url=http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/ghaffar/hyper00.htm |title=Hypersensitivity reactions |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> the [[antibodies]] produced by the immune response bind to [[antigens]] on the patient's own cell surfaces. The antigens recognized in this way may either be intrinsic ("self" antigen, innately part of the patient's cells) or extrinsic (adsorbed onto the cells during exposure to some foreign antigen, possibly as part of infection with a pathogen). These cells are recognized by [[macrophage]]s or [[dendritic cell]]s, which act as antigen-presenting cells. This causes a [[B cell]] response, wherein antibodies are produced against the foreign antigen.

An example of type II hypersensitivity is the reaction to penicillin wherein the drug can bind to red blood cells, causing them to be recognized as different; B cell proliferation will take place and antibodies to the drug are produced.  [[IgG]] and [[IgM]] antibodies bind to these antigens to form complexes that activate the [[classical complement pathway|classical pathway]] of [[complement system|complement]] activation to eliminate cells presenting foreign antigens (which are usually, but not in this case, pathogens). That is, mediators of acute inflammation are generated at the site and [[Complement membrane attack complex|membrane attack complex]]es cause cell [[lysis]] and death. The reaction takes hours to a day.

Another form of type II hypersensitivity is called [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] (ADCC). Here, cells exhibiting the foreign antigen are tagged with antibodies (IgG or IgM). These tagged cells are then recognised by natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages (recognised via IgG bound (via the Fc region) to the effector cell surface receptor, [[CD16]] (FcÎ³RIII)), which in turn kill these tagged cells. 

== Type II hypersensitivity-like autoimmunity ==

Autoimmune diseases resemble type II-IV hypersensitivity reactions. They differ from hypersensitivity reactions in that the antigens driving the immune process are self-antigens rather than non-self as in hypersensitivity reactions. Below are some examples of Type II hypersensitivity-like autoimmunity.
