'''Saxitoxin''' ('''STX''') is the best-known paralytic shellﬁsh toxin (PST), although other related compounds have been reported, such as [[neosaxitoxin]] (NSTX), the 11-alpha and 11-beta-O-sulphates of saxitoxin and neosaxitoxin, and carbonyl-N-sulphate derivatives of saxitoxin and neosaxitoxin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blunden G. |title=Review: Biologically Active Compounds from Marine Organisms|journal=Phytotherapy Research|volume=15|issue= 2|pages=89–94 |year=2001 |pmid=11268103 |doi= 10.1002/ptr.982|url=http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/alqasoumi/Documents/Biologically%20active%20compounds%20from%20marine%20organisms.pdf|accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref>

}}</ref> Ingestion of saxitoxin (usually through shellfish contaminated by toxic algal blooms) is responsible for the human illness known as [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]] (PSP).

In fact, the term saxitoxin originates from the species name of the butter clam (''[[Saxidomus]] giganteus'') in which it was first recognized. But, the term saxitoxin can also refer to the entire suite of related neurotoxins (known collectively as "saxitoxins") produced by these microorganisms, which include pure saxitoxin (STX), neosaxitoxin (NSTX), gonyautoxins (GTX) and decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX).

Detection of saxitoxin in shellfish such as mussels, clams and scallops frequently leads to closures of commercial and recreational shellfish harvesting, especially in California, Oregon, Washington, and New England.

STX has been found in at least 12 marine [[puffer fish]] fish species in Asia and one freshwater fish [[tilapia]] in Brazil.<ref>

Saxitoxin synthesis is the first non-[[terpene]] [[alkaloid]] pathway described for [[bacteria]]. A complete STX biosynthetic [[gene cluster]] (''sxt'') is used to obtain a more favourable reaction. The predicted reaction sequence of suggested SxtA, based on its [[primary structure]], is the loading of the [[Acyl Carrier Protein|ACP]] with [[acetate]] from [[acetyl-CoA]], followed by SxtA-catalyzed [[methylation]] of acetyl-ACP, which is then converted to [[Propionic acid|propionyl]]-ACP. Later another SxtA performs a [[Claisen condensation]] reaction between propionyl-ACP and [[arginine]] producing 4.

SxtG transfers an [[amidino]] group from arginine to the α-amino 4 group producing 5, which later undergoes retroaldol-like [[condensation reaction|condensation]] by SxtB. SxtD adds a [[double bond]] between C-1 and C-5 of 6, which gives rise to the 1,2-H shift between C-5 and C-6 in 7. SxtS performs an [[epoxidation]] of the double bond and opening of the epoxide to an [[aldehyde]]. SxtU reduces the terminal aldehyde group of the STX precursor 9 forming 10. SxtI catalyzes the transfer of a [[carbamoyl]] group to the free [[hydroxyl]] group on 10. SxtH and SxtT perform a similar function which is the consecutive [[hydroxylation]] of C-12 terminating the STX biosynthetic pathway. This is only a proposed biosynthetic pathway; the actual mechanism of how [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] bind to the enzymes is still unknown.

== Synthesis ==

The challenge for chemical synthesis comes from the dense arrangement of [[heteroatom]]s on the tricyclic structure and the dicationic nature of STX further complicates the purification of the target molecule.

The starting material of this synthesis is a commercially available compound, a [[glycerol]]-derived [[sulfamic acid|sulfamate]] [[ester]] 12. This is [[oxidized]] to form a product N,O-[[acetal]] 13 and is [[alkynylated]] with zinc reagent and BF<sub>3</sub>•OEt<sub>2</sub>, producing 14 and a subsequent reaction of [[tosylation]] at the C10 of the substituted [1,2,3]-oxathiazinane-2,2-dioxide [[heterocycle]], which later undergoes [[azide]] displacement of the primary tosylate 15. The [[PMB ether|p-methoxybenzyl]] (PMB) is used to [[protecting group|protect]] the NH group by [[alkylation]] 16 before performing a reduction of azide with Me<sub>3</sub>P and a p-methoxybenzenesulfonyl (Mbs) containing compound to produce [[isothiourea]] 17. With the PMB and Mbs protecting groups, another azide is introduced at C6, losing PMB under oxidative condition 19. An [[imidoyl chloride]], MbsN=CCl<sub>2</sub>, is used to re-protect the nitrogen near the tosylate site, before activating the oxathiazinane heterocycle by [[hydrolysis]]. At this point, 20, all the required carbon in tricyclic structure of STX is obtained. Next, Me<sub>3</sub>P is used to reduce azide which is then treated with [[silver nitrate|AgNO<sub>3</sub>]] resulting in [[carbodiimide]] formation and ring closure 23. Adding [[trichloroacetyl isocyanate]], 23 is converted to [[carbamate]] derivative of STX 24 which can be easily isolated. The 4 double bonds on 24 are then oxidized which shows the efficiency of this synthetic route. An addition of another bicycle reagent of B(O<sub>2</sub>CCF<sub>3</sub>) in acid produces beta-STXol, while stabilizing the carbamate [[side chain]]. The last step of the synthesis is to oxidize on the carbon with hydroxyl group with [[dicyclohexylcarbodiimide|DCC]], [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N•HO<sub>2</sub>CCF<sub>3</sub>. The product can be highly purified using [[acetonitrile|CH<sub>3</sub>CN]], H<sub>2</sub>O and 10 mM [[heptafluorobutyric acid]], giving overall yield of 1.3%.<ref>{{Cite journal

== Human illness ==

The human illness associated with ingestion of harmful levels of saxitoxin is known as [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]], or PSP, and saxitoxin and its derivatives are often referred to as "'''PSP toxins'''".<ref name="uhm"/>

The [[medical]] and ecological importance of saxitoxin lies mainly in effects of [[harmful algal bloom]]s on [[shellfish]] and certain finfish which can concentrate the toxin, making it available both for human consumption as well as by various marine organisms. The blocking of neuronal [[sodium channel]]s which occurs in PSP produces a [[flaccid paralysis]] that leaves its victim calm and conscious through the progression of [[symptom]]s. Death often occurs from [[respiratory failure]]. PSP toxins have been implicated in various marine animal mortalities involving [[food chain|trophic transfer]] of the toxin from its algal source up the food web to higher [[predator]]s.

There are some reports on reversal of lethal effects of saxitoxin using [[4-aminopyridine]],<ref>{{Cite pmid|9643470|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|9268607|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|8917674|noedit}}</ref> but there are no studies on human subject.

== Military interest ==

STX is highly toxic, killing guinea pigs at only 5&nbsp;µg/kg when injected i.m. The lethal doses for mice are very similar with varying administration routes: t i.p. (LD50 = 10&nbsp;µg/kg), i.v. (LD50 = 3.4&nbsp;µg/kg) or p.o. (LD50 = 263&nbsp;µg/kg). The oral LD50 for humans is 5.7&nbsp;µg/kg, therefore approximately 0.57&nbsp;mg of saxitoxin is lethal if ingested and the lethal dose by injection is about ten times lower. The human inhalation toxicity of aerosolized saxitoxin is estimated to be 5&nbsp;mg/min/m³. Saxitoxin can enter the body via open wounds and a lethal dose of 0.05&nbsp;mg/person by this route has been suggested. Saxitoxin is 1,000 times more toxic than the potent nerve gas sarin.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Patocka J |coauthors=Stredav L|title=Brief Review of Natural Nonprotein Neurotoxins|journal=ASA Newsletter|date=April 23, 2002|volume=02-2|issue=89|pages=16–23|url=http://www.asanltr.com/newsletter/02-2/articles/Neurotoxins.htm|accessdate=26 May 2012|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Price|at=Newsletter archives|publisher=Applied Science and Analysis inc.|issn=1057-9419}}</ref>

It is listed in [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|schedule 1]] of the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. The [[United States military]] isolated saxitoxin and assigned it the [[chemical weapon designation]] '''TZ'''.

<!--According to the book ''Spycraft'', [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spyplane pilots were provided with needles containing saxitoxin to be used for suicide in the event escape was impossible.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}-->[[Lockheed_U-2|U-2]] pilot [[Francis Gary Powers]] was issued a hollow silver dollar containing a tiny, saxitoxin-impregnated needle,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Unauthorized Storage of Toxic Agents |volume=1 |page=7 |url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/vol1/html/ChurchV1_0006b.htm |series=[[Church Committee]] Reports |publisher=The Assassination Archives and Research Center (AARC) |year=1975–1976}}</ref> to be used to [[suicide pill|commit suicide]] in case of capture by enemy forces.

For a lung effect by aerosol, the median lethal dosage (LCt<sub>50</sub>) of TZ is 5 [[milligram|mg]]·[[minute|min]]/m³. Due to its high aerobiological decay rate (e.g., ~17%/min) and production cost, it was weaponized in tainted [[flechette]]s for special operations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Though its early isolation and characterization were from military efforts, saxitoxin has been more important to cellular research in delineating the function of the [[sodium channel]].
