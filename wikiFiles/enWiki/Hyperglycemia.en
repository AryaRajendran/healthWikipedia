'''Hyperglycemia''', or '''high blood sugar''' ([[American and British English differences|also spelled]] '''hyperglycaemia''' or '''hyperglycæmia''', not to be confused with [[hypoglycemia]]) is a condition in which an excessive amount of [[glucose]] circulates in the [[blood plasma]]. This is generally a glucose level higher than 11.1 mmol/l (200&nbsp;'''[[Blood_sugar#Units|mg/dl]]'''). [[Reference ranges for blood tests]] are 11.1 '''mmol/l''', but symptoms may not start to become noticeable until even higher values such as 250–300&nbsp;mg/dl or 15–20&nbsp; mmol/l. A subject with a consistent range between 100 and 126 (American Diabetes Association guidelines) is considered hyperglycemic, while above 126 mg/dl or 7 mmol/l is generally held to have [[diabetes]]. Chronic levels exceeding 7&nbsp;[[Reference ranges for blood tests|mmol/l]] (125&nbsp;mg/dl) can produce organ damage. 

The origin of the term is [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''hyper-'', meaning excessive; ''-glyc-'', meaning sweet; and ''-emia'', meaning ''of the blood''. 

==Definition==
It is critical for patients who monitor glucose levels at home to be aware of which units of measurement their testing kit uses.
Glucose levels are measured in either: 
# Milligrams per decilitre (mg/dl), in the United States and other countries (e.g., Japan, France, Egypt, Colombia); or
# [[Millimoles]] per litre (mmol/l), in Canada, which can be acquired by dividing mg/dl by 18.<ref>[http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/converter.htm Blood glucose converter-mg/dl to mmol/L and vice-versa-Children With Diabetes]</ref> 

Scientific journals are moving towards using mmol/l; some journals now use mmol/l as
the primary unit but quote mg/dl in parentheses.<ref>[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/diabetes/faq/part1/section-9.html What are mg/dl and mmol/l? How to convert?]</ref>

Glucose levels vary before and after meals, and at various times of day; the definition of "normal" varies among medical professionals. In general, the normal range for most people (fasting adults) is about 80 to 110&nbsp;mg/dl or 4 to 6&nbsp;mmol/l. (where 80 mg/dl is "optimal".)  A subject with a consistent range above 126&nbsp;mg/dl or 7&nbsp;mmol/l is generally held to have hyperglycemia, whereas a consistent range below 70&nbsp;mg/dl or 4&nbsp;mmol/l is considered [[hypoglycemic]].  In [[Fasting#Fasting for Medical Reasons|fasting]] adults, blood plasma glucose should not exceed 126 mg/dL.  Sustained higher levels of [[blood sugar]] cause damage to the blood vessels and to the organs they supply, leading to the complications of diabetes.<ref>{{cite web |title=High Blood Sugar |url=http://www.totalhealthlife.com/Conditions/high-blood-sugar.html |author=Total Health Life |publisher=Total Health Institute |year=2005 |accessdate=May 4, 2011}}</ref>

Chronic hyperglycemia can be measured via the [[HbA1c]] test. The definition of acute hyperglycemia varies by study, with mmol/l levels from 8 to 15.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giugliano D, Marfella R, Coppola L, ''et al.'' |title=Vascular effects of acute hyperglycemia in humans are reversed by L-arginine. Evidence for reduced availability of nitric oxide during hyperglycemia |journal=Circulation |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=1783–90 |year=1997 |pmid=9107164 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.95.7.1783}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Temporary hyperglycemia is often benign and asymptomatic. Blood glucose levels can rise well above normal for significant periods without producing any permanent effects or symptoms. However, chronic hyperglycemia at levels more than slightly above normal can produce a very wide variety of serious complications over a period of years, including kidney damage, neurological damage, cardiovascular damage, [[diabetic retinopathy|damage to the retina]] or damage to feet and legs. [[Diabetic neuropathy]] may be a result of long-term hyperglycemia.   

In diabetes mellitus (by far the most common cause of chronic hyperglycemia), treatment aims at maintaining blood glucose at a level as close to normal as possible, in order to avoid these serious long-term complications.  This is done by a combination of proper diet, regular exercise, and insulin or other medication such as [[Metformin]], etc.

Acute hyperglycemia involving glucose levels that are extremely high is a medical emergency and can rapidly produce serious complications (such as fluid loss through [[osmotic diuresis]]). It is most often seen in persons who have uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes.

The following symptoms may be associated with acute or chronic hyperglycemia, with the first three composing the classic hyperglycemic triad:

* [[Polyphagia]] - frequent hunger, especially pronounced hunger
* [[Polydipsia]] - frequent thirst, especially excessive thirst
* [[Polyuria]] - frequent urination
* [[Blurred vision]]
* [[Fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]] (sleepiness)
* [[Weight loss]]
* Poor [[wound]] healing (cuts, scrapes, etc.)
* [[Dry mouth]]
* Dry or itchy [[skin]]
* Tingling in feet or heels
* [[Erectile dysfunction]]
* Recurrent [[infection]]s, external ear infections ([[Otitis externa|swimmer's ear]])
* [[Cardiac arrhythmia]]
* [[Stupor]]
* [[Coma]]
* Seizures 

Frequent hunger without other symptoms can also indicate that blood sugar levels are too low.  This may occur when people who have diabetes take too much oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin for the amount of food they eat. The resulting drop in blood sugar level to below the normal range prompts a hunger response.  This hunger is not usually as pronounced as in Type I diabetes, especially the juvenile onset form, but it makes the prescription of oral hypoglycemic medication difficult to manage.

Polydipsia and polyuria occur when blood glucose levels rise high enough to result in excretion of excess glucose via the kidneys ([[glycosuria]]), producing [[osmotic diuresis]].

Symptoms of [[Diabetic Ketoacidosis]] may include:
* [[Ketoacidosis]]
* [[Kussmaul hyperventilation]]: deep, rapid breathing
* Confusion or a decreased level of consciousness
* Dehydration due to [[glycosuria]] and osmotic diuresis
* Acute hunger and/or thirst
* 'Fruity' smelling breath odor 
* Impairment of cognitive function, along with increased sadness and anxiety<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pais I, Hallschmid M, Jauch-Chara K, ''et al.'' |title=Mood and cognitive functions during acute euglycaemia and mild hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients |journal=Exp.

==Causes==

===Diabetes mellitus===
Chronic hyperglycemia that persists even in fasting states is most commonly caused by [[diabetes mellitus]].  In fact, chronic hyperglycemia is the defining characteristic of the disease.  Intermittent hyperglycemia may be present in prediabetic states. Acute episodes of hyperglycemia without an obvious cause may indicate developing diabetes or a predisposition to the disorder.

In diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia is usually caused by low [[insulin]] levels ([[Diabetes mellitus type 1]]) and/or by resistance to insulin at the cellular level ([[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]), depending on the type and state of the disease. Low insulin levels and/or insulin resistance prevent the body from converting glucose into [[glycogen]] (a starch-like source of energy stored mostly in the liver), which in turn makes it difficult or impossible to remove excess glucose from the blood. With normal glucose levels, the total amount of glucose in the blood at any given moment is only enough to provide energy to the body for 20-30 minutes, and so glucose levels must be precisely maintained by the body's internal control mechanisms. When the mechanisms fail in a way that allows glucose to rise to abnormal levels, hyperglycemia is the result.

===Drugs===
Certain medications increase the risk of hyperglycemia, including [[corticosteroids]], [[octreotide]], [[beta blocker]]s, [[epinephrine]], [[thiazide]] [[diuretic]]s, [[niacin]], [[pentamidine]], [[protease inhibitors]], [[L-asparaginase]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cetin M, Yetgin S, Kara A, ''et al.'' |title=Hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis and other complications of L-asparaginase in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia |journal=J Med |volume=25 |issue=3–4 |pages=219–29 |year=1994 |pmid=7996065}}</ref> and some [[antipsychotic]] agents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Luna B, Feinglos MN |title=Drug-induced hyperglycemia |journal=JAMA |volume=286 |issue=16 |pages=1945–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11667913 | doi = 10.1001/jama.286.16.1945}}</ref> The acute administration of [[stimulants]] such as [[amphetamine]] typically produces hyperglycemia; chronic use, however, produces [[hypoglycemia]]. Some of the newer psychotropic medications, such as [[Zyprexa]] (Olanzapine) and [[Cymbalta]] (Duloxetine), can also cause significant hyperglycemia.

===Critical illness===
A high proportion of patients suffering an acute stress such as [[stroke]] or [[myocardial infarction]] may develop hyperglycemia, even in the absence of a diagnosis of diabetes.   (Or perhaps stroke or myocardial infarction was caused by hyperglycemia and undiagnosed diabetes.)  Human and animal studies suggest that this is not benign, and that stress-induced hyperglycemia is associated with a high risk of mortality after both stroke and myocardial infarction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Capes SE, Hunt D, Malmberg K, Pathak P, Gerstein HC |title=Stress hyperglycemia and prognosis of stroke in nondiabetic and diabetic patients: a systematic overview |journal=Stroke |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=2426–32 |year=2001 |pmid=11588337 |doi=10.1161/hs1001.096194}}</ref>

The following conditions can also cause hyperglycemia in the absence of diabetes. 1) Dysfunction of the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary glands 2) Numerous diseases of the pancreas 3) Severe increases in blood glucose may be seen in sepsis and certain infections 4) Intracranial diseases (frequently overlooked) can also cause hyperglycemia. Encephalitis, brain tumors (especially those located near the pituitary gland), brain bleeds, and meningitis are prime examples. 5) Mid to high blood sugar levels are often seen in convulsions and terminal stages of many diseases. Prolonged, major surgeries can temporarily increase glucose levels. Certain forms of severe stress and physical trauma can increase levels for a brief time as well yet rarely exceeds 120 mg/dl.

==Complications==
Hyperglycemia can be a serious problem if not treated in time. In untreated hyperglycemia, a condition called [[ketoacidosis]] (contrast [[ketosis]]) could occur. Ketoacidosis develops when the body does not have enough [[insulin]]. Without insulin, the body isn't able to utilize the glucose for fuel, so the body starts to break down fats for energy.

Ketoacidosis is a life-threatening condition which needs immediate treatment. Symptoms include: shortness of breath, breath that smells fruity (such as pear drops), nausea and vomiting, and very dry mouth.
Chronic hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) injures the heart, in patients without a history of heart disease or diabetes and is strongly associated with heart attacks and death in subjects with no coronary heart disease or history of heart failure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronic hyperglycemia may lead to cardiac damage|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20120203/Chronic-hyperglycemia-may-lead-to-cardiac-damage.aspx|work=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref> 

==Treatment==
Treatment of hyperglycemia requires elimination of the underlying cause, ''e.g.,'' treatment of diabetes when diabetes is the cause.  Acute hyperglycemia can be treated by direct administration of insulin in most cases. Severe hyperglycemia can be treated with [[Anti-diabetic medication|oral hypoglycemic therapy]] and lifestyle modification.<ref name="rosen">{{cite book |author=Ron Walls MD; John J.
