'''Pellucid marginal degeneration''' (PMD; '''keratotorus'''), is a degenerative [[cornea]]l condition, often confused with [[keratoconus]]. It is typically characterized by a clear, bilateral thinning ([[ectasia]]) in the inferior and peripheral region of the cornea, although some cases affect only one eye.  The cause of the disease remains unclear ([[idiopathic]]). 

The term "pellucid marginal degeneration" was first coined in 1957 by the ophthalmologist Schalaeppi.<ref name="one">{{Cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic551.htm|title=Pellucid Marginal Degeneration|accessdate=September 3, 2007|publisher=WebMD|year=2005|author=Karim Rasheed, MD}}</ref> The word "pellucid" means clear, indicating that the corneas retain clarity in pellucid marginal degeneration.<ref name=PMDreview />

==Signs and Symptoms==
Unlike keratoconus, pain is not typically present in pellucid marginal degeneration, and aside from vision loss, no symptoms accompany the condition. However, in rare cases, PMD may present with sudden onset vision loss and excruciating eye pain, which occurs if the thinning of the cornea leads to [[perforation]].<ref name=PMDreview>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clae.2010.11.007 |title=Pellucid corneal marginal degeneration: A review |year=2011 |last1=Jinabhai |first1=Amit |last2=Radhakrishnan |first2=Hema |last3=o’Donnell |first3=Clare |journal=Contact Lens and Anterior Eye |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=56–63 |pmid=21185225}}</ref> While PMD usually affects both eyes, some unilateral cases have been reported.<ref name="three">{{cite journal |pmid=11217258 |year=2000 |last1=Basak |first1=SK |last2=Hazra |first2=TK |last3=Bhattacharya |first3=D |last4=Sinha |first4=TK |title=Unilateral pellucid marginal degeneration |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=233–4 |journal=Indian journal of ophthalmology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.eye.6700301 |title=Unilateral pellucid marginal degeneration |year=2003 |last1=Kaushik |first1=S |last2=Jain |first2=A K |last3=Saini |first3=J S |journal=Eye |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=246–8 |pmid=12640416}}</ref> 

PMD is characterized by bilateral thinning ([[ectasia]]) in the inferior and peripheral region of the cornea. The distribution of the degeneration is crescent or arcuate shaped. The cornea just above the region of thinning is of normal thickness, and may protrude anteriorly, which creates an irregular [[astigmatism]].<ref name=Whats_in_a_name /> This is described as a "beer belly" appearance since the greatest protrusion occurs below the horizontal midline (unlike keratoconus).  Normally, PMD does not present with vascularization of the cornea, scarring, or any deposits of lipid.<ref name="three" /> 

==Pathophysiology==
PMD is an [[idiopathic]],<ref name="one" /> non-inflammatory condition. The thinning of the corneas may approach 20% of normal thickness. There may be an increase in the number of [[mucopolysaccharides]] in the [[corneal stroma]]. The [[Bowman's layer]] of the cornea may be absent, irregular, or have ruptured areas.

==Diagnosis==
The center of the cornea shows normal thickness, with an intact central epithelium, but the inferior cornea exhibits a peripheral band of thinning, to about 1-2 mm.  The portion of the cornea that is immediately adjacent to the limbus is spared, usually a strip of about 1-2 mm.<ref name=PMcornealD /> In PMD we can see high [[Astigmatism (eye)#Based on axis of the principal meridians|against the rule astigmatism]]<ref name=PMcornealD>{{cite journal |pmid=352310 |year=1978 |last1=Krachmer |first1=JH |title=Pellucid marginal corneal degeneration |volume=96 |issue=7 |pages=1217–21 |journal=Archives of ophthalmology |doi=10.1001/archopht.1978.03910060051009}}</ref> along with horizontal bow ties. The inferior peripheral thinning is seen between the 4 o'clock and 8 [[Clock position|o'clock positions]].<ref name=CXLstatus />

Unlike keratoconus, PMD lacks apical corneal scarring, Rizutti's phenomenon, [[Munson's sign]], and the central corneal thickness is usually normal.<ref name=PMDreview />

The [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard diagnostic test]] for PMD is [[corneal topography]].<ref name=PMDreview /> However, it may not as [[Specificity (tests)|specific]] as [[corneal pachymetry]], because corneal topography only evaluates the degree and distribution of surface irregularities on the cornea, not the thickness of the cornea.<ref name=Whats_in_a_name>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajo.2011.03.028 |title=What's in a Name: Keratoconus, Pellucid Marginal Degeneration, and Related Thinning Disorders |year=2011 |last1=Belin |first1=Michael W. |last2=Asota |first2=Ijeoma M. |last3=Ambrosio |first3=Renato |last4=Khachikian |first4=Stephen S. |journal=American Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=157–162.e1 |pmid=21708379}}</ref> Corneal topography may show a "crab claw-like" appearance, a finding that is seen in both keratoconus and in pellucid marginal degeneration.

==Treatment==
===Eye glasses===
Most patients can be treated non-surgically with eye glasses, or contact lenses.<ref name=ManagmentofPMD>{{cite journal |pmid=15968160 |year=2005 |last1=Tzelikis |first1=PF |last2=Cohen |first2=EJ |last3=Rapuano |first3=CJ |last4=Hammersmith |first4=KM |last5=Laibson |first5=PR |title=Management of pellucid marginal corneal degeneration |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=555–60 |journal=Cornea |doi=10.1097/01.ico.0000153555.82278.5b}}</ref> 

===Contact lenses===
The early stages of pellucid marginal degeneration may also be managed with soft contact lenses.<ref name=PMDreview /> Success has been shown with the use of rigid [[contact lenses]] combined with over-[[refraction]]. Patients wearing contacts report increased problems with glare and contrast sensitivity, but it is not clear if this is due to the corneal disease, or the contact lenses themselves.

New studies found that the use of [[Scleral lens|Scleral contact lens]], also known as a gas permeable ("GP") lens, may be a good option for most patients with PMD.  Most of these lenses are in the range of 15.5mm to 18.0mm in diameter.  Regardless of the lens size, it is thought that the larger the GP lens, regardless of the fact that it is a rigid lens, will in most cases be more comfortable then standard rigid corneal lenses, and at times more comfortable than soft lenses.  The highlight to the scleral design and the correction of eye disorders such as pellucid marginal degeneration is that vision with these types of lenses is exceptional when fit correctly.

===Intacs===
The use of [[intacs]] implants has been tested as a treatment for PMD, with slight improvement in visual acuity noted after eleven months,<ref name="four">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0886-3350(03)00656-4 |title=Intacs for early pellucid marginal degeneration |year=2004 |last1=Kymionis |first1=George D |last2=Aslanides |first2=Ioannis M |last3=Siganos |first3=Charalambos S |last4=Pallikaris |first4=Ioannis G |journal=Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery |volume=30 |pages=230}}</ref> and intacs have been used with keratoconus with success.<ref name="five">{{Cite web|url=http://intacsforkeratoconus.com/main/|title=A new FDA approved option for keratoconus filling the gap between contact lenses and a corneal transplant|accessdate=September 3, 2007|publisher=Intacs|year=2005|author=Intacs|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070809075022/http://intacsforkeratoconus.com/main/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = August 9, 2007}}</ref>

===Collagen Cross Linking===
{{main|Cross-linking (surgery)}}
There is evidence suggesting corneal collagen cross-linking may be beneficial for patients with pellucid marginal degeneration.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/1874364101105010017 |title=Additional Applications of Corneal Cross Linking |year=2011 |last1=Kozobolis |first1=Vassilios |journal=The Open Ophthalmology Journal |volume=5 |pages=17–8 |pmid=21448300 |last2=Labiris |first2=G |last3=Gkika |first3=M |last4=Sideroudi |first4=H |pmc=3065117}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2009.03.025 |title=Management of pellucid marginal corneal degeneration with simultaneous customized photorefractive keratectomy and collagen crosslinking |year=2009 |last1=Kymionis |first1=George D. |last2=Karavitaki |first2=Alexandra E. |last3=Kounis |first3=George A. |last4=Portaliou |first4=Dimitra M. |last5=Yoo |first5=Sonia H. |last6=Pallikaris |first6=Ioannis G. |journal=Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery |volume=35 |issue=7 |pmid=19545822 |pages=1298–301}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3928/1081597X-20100114-03 |title=Corneal Collagen Cross-Linking with Riboflavin and UVA Irradiation in Pellucid Marginal Degeneration |year=2010 |last1=Spadea |first1=Leopoldo |journal=Journal of Refractive Surgery |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=375–7 |pmid=20128533}}</ref> Research shows some promising results by combining collagen cross linking with [[photorefractive keratectomy]], or with [[Corneal topography|topography]]-guided transepithelial surface [[ablation]].<ref name=CXLstatus>{{cite journal|last=Hovakimyan|first=Marine|coauthors=Guthoff, Rudolf F.; Stachs, Oliver|title=Collagen Cross-Linking: Current Status and Future Directions|journal=Journal of Ophthalmology|date=31|year=2011|month=March|volume=2012|pages=1–12|doi=10.1155/2012/406850|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jop/2012/406850/|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> 

===Surgery===
[[Corneal transplantation|Corneal transplant surgery]] may be difficult due to the peripheral thinning of the cornea, even with large and off-center grafts.<ref name=ManagmentofPMD /> Therefore, surgery is usually reserved for patients that do not tolerate contact lenses. Several different surgical approaches may be taken, and no one approach is currently established as the standard. Examples of surgical procedures used for PMD include: [[wedge resection]], lamellar crescentic resection, [[penetrating keratoplasty]], lamellar keratoplasty, epikeratoplasty and intracorneal segments. Transplantation of the entire thickness of the cornea (penetrating keratoplasty) may be performed if there is enough normal tissue present. However, if there is not enough normal tissue present, then attaching the graft is difficult. 

Due to the thinning of the cornea, PMD patients are poor candidates for procedures such as [[LASIK]] and [[photorefractive keratectomy]].<ref name="two">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ophthalmologytimes.com/ophthalmologytimes/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=385376|title=Signs of pellucid marginal degeneration should rule out refractive surgery|accessdate=September 3, 2007|publisher=Ophthalmology Times|year=2006|author=Ophthalmology Times}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
The incidence and prevalence of PMD are unknown, and no studies have yet investigated its prevalence or incidence.  However, it is generally agreed that PMD is a very rare condition.<ref name=PMDreview /> Some uncertainty regarding the incidence of PMD may be attributed to its confusion with keratoconus. PMD is not linked to race or age, although most cases present early in life, between 20 and 40 years of age.<ref name="two" /> While PMD is usually considered to affect men and women equally, some studies suggest that it may affect men more frequently.<ref name=PMDreview /> 

Several diseases have been observed in patients with PMD. However, no causal relationships have been established between the any of the associated diseases and the pathogenesis of PMD. Such diseases include: chronic open-angle glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal lattice degeneration, scleroderma,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15186210 |year=2004 |last1=Sii |first1=F |last2=Lee |first2=GA |last3=Sanfilippo |first3=P |last4=Stephensen |first4=DC |title=Pellucid marginal degeneration and scleroderma |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=180–4 |journal=Clinical & experimental optometry |doi=10.1111/j.1444-0938.2004.tb03172.x}}</ref> kerato-conjunctivitis, eczema, and hyperthyroidism.

==Prognosis==
Visual function declines as a result of the irregular corneal shape, resulting in [[astigmatism]], and causing a distortion in vision. Deterioration can become severe over time.
