'''Oat sensitivity''' represents a sensitivity to the proteins found in [[oats]], ''[[Avena sativa]]''. Sensitivity to oats
as a result of allergy or to the seed storage proteins either inhaled or ingested. A more complex condition results to individuals who have [[gluten-sensitive enteropathy]] in which there is also a response to [[avenin]], the glutinous protein in oats similar to the gluten within wheat.

==Oat allergy==
Studies on farmers with grain dust allergy and children with [[atopy]] [[dermatitis]] reveal that oat proteins can act as both respiratory and skin allergens.<ref name=pmid17919139>{{cite journal |author=Boussault P, Léauté-Labrèze C, Saubusse E, ''et al.'' |title=Oat sensitization in children with atopic dermatitis: prevalence, risks and associated factors |journal=Allergy |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=1251–6 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17919139 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01527.x }}</ref><ref name=pmid16805419>{{cite journal |author=Codreanu F, Morisset M, Cordebar V, Kanny G, Moneret-Vautrin DA |title=Risk of allergy to food proteins in topical medicinal agents and cosmetics |journal=Eur Ann Allergy Clin Immunol |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=126–30 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16805419 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name=pmid12464060>{{cite journal |author=De Paz Arranz S, Pérez Montero A, Remón LZ, Molero MI |title=Allergic contact urticaria to oatmeal |journal=Allergy |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=1215 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12464060 |doi= 10.1034/j.1398-9995.2002.23893_7.x|url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid10871113">{{cite journal |author=Pazzaglia M, Jorizzo M, Parente G, Tosti A |title=Allergic contact dermatitis due to avena extract |journal=Contact Derm. |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=364 |year=2000 |month=June |pmid=10871113 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name=pmid6154431>{{cite journal |author=Baldo BA, Krilis S, Wrigley CW |title=Hypersensitivity to inhaled flour allergens.

==Avenin-sensitive enteropathy==
Gluten-sensitive enteropathy and its common and more severe form, [[coeliac disease]], results in the increased inflammation of the tissues of the small bowel eventually leading to villus atrophy. The disease progresses from increase lymphocyte counts to eventual  flattening of the villi and crypt hyperplasia. Originally, oats were believed to cause coeliac disease. However this confusion was largely due to significant contamination of oats with wheat, barley or rye. A recent review of controlled oat tolerance studies indicated only one documented avenin-sensitive enteropathy (ASE) in 165, placing the risk of ASE at 0.6% of coeliac disease population. However, during the controlled studies, 17 candidates dropped out due to symptoms after ingestion of GF oats and were not tested at the completion of their respective studies. As a result, the actual risk of ASE in the coelic disease population may be slightly higher.<ref name=pmid17327936>{{cite journal |author=Garsed K, Scott BB |title=Can oats be taken in a gluten-free diet?

===Immunological evidence===
====Anti-avenin antibodies====
In 1992, 6 proteins were extracted from oats that reacted with a single coeliac sera. The proteins, [[prolamin]]s, were called CIP 1 (gamma [[avenin]]), CIP 2, and CIP3. They had the following amino-acid sequences:
 Antibody recognition sites on three avenins
 CIP1 (γ-avenin)               P S E Q Y Q P Y P E Q Q Q P F 
 CIP2 (γ-avenin) T T T V Q Y D P S E Q Y Q P Y P E Q Q Q P F V Q Q Q P P F 
 CIP3 (α-avenin) T T T V Q Y N P S E Q Y Q P Y  
Within the same study, 3 other proteins were identified, one was an α-[[amylase]] inhibitor, identified by protein homology. A follow-up study showed that most celiacs have anti-avenin antibodies(AVA), with a specificity and sensitivity comparable to [[anti-gliadin antibodies]].<ref name="pmid10964162">{{cite journal |author=Ribes-Koninckx C, Alfonso P, Ortigosa L, ''et al.'' |title=A beta-turn rich oats peptide as an antigen in an ELISA method for the screening of coeliac disease in a paediatric population |journal=Eur.

The study however did find an increase number of patients with higher intraepithelial [[lymphocytes]] (IEL, a type of white bloodcell) in the oat-eating cohort. Regardless of whether or not this observation is a direct allergic immune response, by itself this is essentially [[benign]].

====Cellular immunity====
In gluten-sensitive enteropathy, prolamins mediate between T-cells and antigen presenting cells, whereas [[anti-transglutaminase antibodies]] confer autoimmunity via covalent attachment to gliadin. In 16 examined coeliacs, none produced a significant [[Th1 cell|Th1]] response.<ref name="pmid12477758">{{cite journal |author=Kilmartin C, Lynch S, Abuzakouk M, Wieser H, Feighery C |title=Avenin fails to induce a Th1 response in coeliac tissue following in vitro culture |journal=Gut |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=47–52 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12477758 |pmc=1773501 |doi= 10.1136/gut.52.1.47|url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12477758}}</ref>  Th1 responses are needed to stimulate T-helper cells that mediate disease. This could indicate that coeliac disease does not directly involve avenin or that the sample size was too small to detect the occasional responder. 

Evidence that there are exceptional cases came in a 2004 study on oats.<ref name="pmid15526039"/> The patients drafted for this study were those who had symptoms of celiac disease when on a 'pure-oat' challenge, therefore not representative of a celiac sample. This study found that 4 patients had symptoms after oat ingestion, 3 had elevated [[Gluten sensitivity#Gluten-sensitive enteropathy|Marsh scores]] for histology, and avenin responsive T-cells, indicating '''avenin-sensitive enteropathy'''(ASE). All three patients were [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.5|DQ2.5]]/[[HLA-DQ2|DQ2]] ([[HLA DR3-DQ2]]/DR7-DQ2) phenotype. Patients with DQ2.5/DQ2.2 tend to be the most prone toward gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE), have the highest risk for GS-[[Gluten-sensitive_enteropathy_associated_conditions#GSEA_Lymphoma|EATL]], and shows signs of more severe disease at diagnosis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
While DQ2.5/DQ2 phenotype represents only 25% of celiac patients, it accounts for all of the ASE celiacs, and 60-70% of patients with [[Gluten-sensitive_enteropathy_associated_conditions#GSEA_Lymphoma|GS-EATL]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
Synthetic avenin peptides were synthesized either in native or deamidated form, the deamidated peptides showed higher response.

The overlap of the antibody and T-cell sites, given trypsin digestion of avenin, suggest this region is dominant in immunity. The TCR-site1 was synthetically made as deamidated ("~E~") and native peptide requires transglutaminase to reach full activation. Two studies to date have looked at the ability for different oat-strains to promote various immunochemical aspects of celiac disease.

===Oats and coeliac disease===
There is a great deal of conflicting information regarding the inclusion of oats within a gluten-free diet. Although cross-contamination in the field and during processing partially explains the different reactions that celiacs can have to oat, a recent study indicates that there are also different amounts of gluten present in different cultivars of oat. The G12 antibody, used in the study, is currently the only one that can reliably distinguish between varieties of oat.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Comino|first=Isabel|coauthors=Ana Real, Laura de Lorenzo, Hugh Cornell, Miguel Ángel López-Casado, Francisco Barro, Pedro Lorite, Ma Isabel Torres, Ángel Cebolla, Carolina Sousa|title=Diversity in oat potential immunogenicity: basis for the selection of oat varieties with no toxicity in coeliac disease|journal=Gut|date=12 February 2011|volume=60 | doi = 10.1136/gut.2010.225268 | pmid= 21317420|accessdate=12 March 2011|pmc=3112367}}</ref>  Previous studies have indicated both children and adult coeliacs are largely tolerant of oats.<ref name="pmid4417208">{{cite journal |author=Dissanayake AS, Truelove SC, Whitehead R |title=Lack of harmful effect of oats on small-intestinal mucosa in coeliac disease |journal=Br Med J |volume=4 |issue=5938 |pages=189–91 |year=1974 |month=October |pmid=4417208 |pmc=1612349 |doi=10.1136/bmj.4.5938.189 }}</ref><ref name=pmid7675045>{{cite journal |author=Janatuinen EK, Pikkarainen PH, Kemppainen TA, ''et al.'' |title=A comparison of diets with and without oats in adults with celiac disease |journal=N.
