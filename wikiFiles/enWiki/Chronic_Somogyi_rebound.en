'''Chronic Somogyi rebound''', also called the '''Somogyi effect''' and '''posthypoglycemic hyperglycemia''', is a rebounding high blood sugar that is a response to [[diabetic hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]].<ref>http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/centers/BarbaraDavis/Documents/book-understandingdiabetes/ud06.pdf, ''Understanding Diabetes a.k.a. The Pink Panther Book'' by H. Peter Chase, chapter 6 page 47.</ref> When managing the blood glucose level with insulin injections, this effect is counter-intuitive to insulin users who experience high blood sugar in the morning as a result of an overabundance of insulin at night.

This theoretical phenomenon was named after Dr. [[Michael Somogyi]], a Hungarian-born professor of biochemistry at the Washington University and Jewish Hospital of St. Louis, who prepared the first insulin treatment given to a child with diabetes in the USA in October 1922.<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1852.html Michael Somogyi (www.whonamedit.com)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Somogyi showed that excessive insulin makes diabetes unstable and first published his findings in 1938.<ref>{{cite journal

Compare with the '''[[dawn phenomenon]]''', which is a morning rise in blood sugar in response to waning insulin and a [[growth hormone]] surge (that further antagonizes insulin).

==Background==
A person with [[type 1 diabetes]] should balance insulin delivery to manage their blood glucose level. Occasionally, insufficient [[insulin]] can result in [[hyperglycemia]].  The appropriate response is to take a correction dose of insulin to reduce the blood sugar level and to consider adjusting the insulin regimen to deliver additional insulin in the future to prevent hyperglycemia. Conversely, excessive insulin delivery may result in [[diabetic hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia]]. The appropriate response is to [[diabetic hypoglycemia#Treatment|treat the hypoglycemia]] and to consider adjusting the regimen to reduce insulin in the future.  

Somogyi and others<ref>{{cite doi|10.2337/diabetes.37.12.1608}}</ref> have claimed that if prolonged hypoglycemia is untreated, then stress due to low blood sugar can result in a high blood glucose rebound. The physiological mechanisms driving the rebound are defensive. When the blood glucose level falls below normal, the body responds by releasing the endocrine hormone [[glucagon]] as well as the stress hormones [[epinephrine]], [[cortisol]] and growth hormone. Glucagon facilitates release of glucose from the liver that raises the blood glucose immediately, and the stress hormones cause insulin resistance for several hours, sustaining the elevated blood sugar.

==Detection==
The first line of defense in preventing chronic Somogyi rebound is additional blood glucose testing. [[blood glucose monitoring#Continuous blood glucose monitoring|Continuous blood glucose monitoring]] is the preferred method to detect and prevent the Somogyi rebound, but this technology is not yet widely used.  Alternatively, testing blood sugar more often, 8 to 10 times daily with a traditional [[blood glucose meter]], facilitates detecting the low blood sugar level before such a rebound occurs.

Testing occasionally during the middle of the night is also important, particularly when high waking blood sugars are found, to determine if more insulin is needed to prevent hyperglycemia or if less insulin is needed to prevent such a rebound. 

Sometimes a person with diabetes will experience the Somogyi rebound when awake and notice [[hypoglycemia#Signs and symptoms|symptoms of the initial low blood sugar]] or [[Fight-or-flight response#Physiology of the stress response|symptoms of the rebound]].  At night, waking with a night sweat (perhaps combined with a rapid heart rate) is a symptom of the adrenaline and rebound.  Unfortunately, the evidence shows that patients with type 1 diabetes do not normally wake during nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes [http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040069&ct=1].

While reviewing log data of blood glucose after the fact, signs of Somogyi rebound should be suspected when blood glucose numbers seem ''higher'' after the insulin dosage has been raised, particularly in the morning.

==Avoidance==
In theory, avoidance is simply a matter of preventing [[hyperinsulinism]].  In practice, the difficulty for a diabetic person to aggressively dose insulin to keep blood sugars levels close to normal and at the same time constantly adjust the insulin regimen to the dynamic demands of exercise, stress, and wellness can practically assure occasional hyperinsulinism.  The pharmacokinetic imperfections of all insulin replacement regimens is a severe limitation.

Some practical behaviors which are useful in avoiding chronic Somogyi rebound are:
*frequent blood glucose monitoring (8&ndash;10 times daily);
*[[blood glucose monitoring#Continuous blood glucose monitoring|continuous blood glucose monitoring]];
*logging and review of blood glucose values, searching for patterns of low blood sugar values;
*conservative increases in insulin delivery;
*awareness to the signs of hypoglycemia;
*awareness to hyperglycemia in response to increased delivery of insulin;
*use of appropriate types of insulin (long-acting, short-acting, etc.) in appropriate amounts.

==Controversy==
Although this theory is well known among clinicians and individuals with diabetes, there is little scientific evidence to support it. Clinical studies indicate that a high fasting glucose in the morning is more likely because the insulin given on the previous evening fails to last long enough.<ref>Gale, EA, Kurtz, AB, Tattersall, RB. In search of the Somogyi effect. ''Lancet'' 2:279-282, 1980, PMID 6105438</ref> Studies from 2007 onwards using continuous glucose monitoring show that a high glucose in the morning is not preceded by a low glucose during the night.<ref>Guillod, L., Comte-Perret, S., Monbaron, D., Gaillard, R. C., Ruiz, J. Nocturnal hypoglycaemias in type 1 diabetic patients: what can we learn with continuous glucose monitoring? ''Diabetes Metab'', 2007: 33: 360-365, PMID 17652003</ref> Furthermore, many individuals with hypoglycemic episodes during the night don't wake due to a failure of release of epinephrine during nocturnal hypoglycemia.<ref>Matyka, KA, Crowne, EC, Havel, PJ, Macdonald, IA, Matthews, D, Dunger, DB. Counterregulation during spontaneous nocturnal hypoglycemia in prepubertal children with type 1 diabetes. ''Diabetes Care'' 22:1144-1150, 1999, PMID 10388980</ref>  Thus, Somogyi's theory is not assured and may be refuted.
