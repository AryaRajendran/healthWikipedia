In [[biology]], and specifically [[genetics]], '''epigenetics''' is the study of changes in [[gene expression]] or [[cell (biology)|cellular]] [[phenotype]], caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying [[DNA]] sequence&nbsp;– hence the name ''epi-'' (Greek: ''επί''- over, above, outer) ''-[[genetics]]'', some of which are [[heritable]]. 

It refers to functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such modifications are [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone modification]], both of which serve to regulate gene expression without altering the underlying [[DNA sequence]]. Gene expression can be controlled through the action of repressor proteins that attach to [[silencer (DNA)|silencer]] regions of the DNA. These changes may remain through [[cell division]]s for the remainder of the cell's life and may also last for multiple generations. However, there is no change in the underlying [[DNA]] sequence of the organism;<ref name="pmid17522671">{{cite journal | author = Bird A | title = Perceptions of epigenetics | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 447 | issue = 7143 | pages = 396–8 | year = 2007 | month = May | pmid = 17522671 | doi = 10.1038/nature05913 }}</ref> instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's genes to behave (or "express themselves") differently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080501094940/http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10140 |title=Special report: 'What genes remember' by Philip Hunter &#124; [[Prospect Magazine]] May 2008 issue 146 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-05-01 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>   There are objections to the use of the term epigenetic to describe chemical modification of histone, since it remains unclear whether or not histone modifications are heritable.<ref name="nature2008">{{cite journal |author=Ledford H. |title=Disputed definitions |journal=Nature |year=2008 |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1023–8 |pmid = 18948925 }}</ref>

One example of epigenetic changes in [[eukaryotic]] biology is the process of [[cellular differentiation]].  During [[morphogenesis]], [[totipotent]] [[stem cells]] become the various [[pluripotent]] [[cell line]]s of the [[embryo]], which in turn become fully differentiated cells.  In other words, a single fertilized egg cell – the [[zygote]] – changes into the many cell types including [[neurons]], [[muscle cells]], [[epithelium]], [[endothelium]] of [[blood vessels]], etc. as it continues to [[mitosis|divide]]. It does so by activating some genes while inhibiting others.<ref name="pmid17522676">{{cite journal | author = Reik W | title = Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7143 | pages = 425–32 | year = 2007 | month = May | pmid = 17522676 | doi = 10.1038/nature05918 }}</ref>

==Etymology and definitions==
[[File:Epigenetic mechanisms.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Epigenetic mechanisms]]
There exist several definitions of epigenetics, and as a result, there are disagreements as to what epigenetics should mean.  ''Epigenetics'' (as in "[[epigenetic landscape]]") was coined by [[Conrad Hal Waddington|C. H. Waddington]] in 1942 as a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''[[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]]'' and ''[[genetics]]''.<ref name=waddington>{{cite journal|author=Waddington CH | title = The epigenotype| journal = Endeavour | volume = 1 | pages = 18–20 |doi= | year = 1942 }}</ref>  ''Epigenesis'' is an old<ref name=OED1>According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]: {{quote | The word is used by W. Harvey, ''Exercitationes'' 1651, p. 148, and in the ''English Anatomical Exercitations'' 1653, p. 272. It is explained to mean ‘partium super-exorientium additamentum’, ‘the additament of parts budding one out of another’.}}  It is also worth quoting this adumbration of the definition given there (viz., "The formation of an organic germ as a new product"): {{quote | '''theory of epigenesis''': the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. [...] The opposite theory was formerly known as the ‘theory of evolution’; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the ‘theory of preformation’, sometimes as that of ‘encasement’ or ‘emboîtement’.}}</ref> word that has more recently been used (see ''[[preformationism]]'' for historical background) to describe the differentiation of cells from their initial [[totipotent]] state in embryonic development.  When Waddington coined the term the physical nature of genes and their role in heredity was not known; he used it as a conceptual model of how genes might interact with their surroundings to produce a [[phenotype]].

[[Robin Holliday]] defined epigenetics as "the study of the mechanisms of temporal and spatial control of gene activity during the development of complex organisms."<ref name="pmid2265224">{{cite journal | author = Holliday R | title = Mechanisms for the control of gene activity during development | journal = Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 431–71 | year = 1990 | month = November | pmid = 2265224 | doi =  }}</ref> Thus ''epigenetic'' can be used to describe anything other than DNA sequence that influences the development of an organism.

The more recent usage of the word in science has a stricter definition. It is, as defined by [[Arthur Riggs (geneticist)|Arthur Riggs]] and colleagues, "the study of [[mitosis|mitotically]] and/or [[meiosis|meiotically]] heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence."<ref name="isbn0-87969-490-4">{{cite book | author = Riggs AD, Russo VEA, Martienssen RA | title = Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location = Plainview, N.Y | year = 1996 | pages = | isbn = 0-87969-490-4 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> The Greek prefix ''epi-'' in ''epigenetics'' implies features that are "on top of" or "in addition to" genetics; thus ''epigenetic'' traits exist on top of or in addition to the traditional molecular basis for inheritance.

The term "epigenetics", however, has been used to describe processes which haven't been demonstrated to be heritable such as histone modification, there are therefore attempts to redefine it in broader terms that would avoid the constraints of requiring heritability.  For example, [[Adrian Peter Bird|Adrian Bird]] defined epigenetics as "the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register, signal or perpetuate altered activity states."<ref name="pmid17522671" /> This definition would be inclusive of transient modifications associated with [[DNA repair]] or [[cell-cycle]] phases as well as stable changes maintained across multiple cell generations, but exclude others such as templating of membrane architecture and [[prions]] unless they impinge on chromosome function.  Such redefinitions however are not universally accepted and are still subject to dispute.<ref name="nature2008"/>

In 2008, a consensus definition of the epigenetic trait, "stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence", was made at a Cold Spring Harbor meeting.<ref name="pmid19339683">{{cite journal | title=An operational definition of epigenetics | author=Berger SL, Kouzarides T, Shiekhattar R, Shilatifard A | year=2009 | journal=Genes Dev. | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=781–3 | url=http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/23/7/781.full  | pmid=19339683 | doi=10.1101/gad.1787609}}</ref>

The similarity of the word to "genetics" has generated many parallel usages. The "epigenome" is a parallel to the word "[[genome]]", and refers to the overall epigenetic state of a cell. The phrase "[[genetic code]]" has also been adapted—the "[[epigenetic code]]" has been used to describe the set of epigenetic features that create different phenotypes in different cells. Taken to its extreme, the "epigenetic code" could represent the total state of the cell, with the position of each molecule accounted for in an ''epigenomic map'', a diagrammatic representation of the gene expression, DNA methylation and histone modification status of a particular genomic region. More typically, the term is used in reference to systematic efforts to measure specific, relevant forms of epigenetic information such as the [[histone code hypothesis|histone code]] or [[DNA methylation]] patterns.  

The psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] used the term ''epigenetic'' in his book [[Erik Erikson#Bibliography|''Identity: Youth and Crisis'' (1968)]]. Erikson writes that the ''epigenetic principle'' is where "anything that grows has a ground plan, and that out of this ground plan, the parts arise, each part having its time of special ascendancy, until all parts have arisen to form a functioning whole."<ref>{{cite book|last=Erikson|first=Erik|title=Identity: Youth and Crisis|year=1968|publisher=W.W. Norton and Company, Inc.|location=Chapter 3|page=92}}</ref>  That usage, however, is of primarily historical interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-definition/Epigenetics|title=Epigenetics|publisher= Bio-Medicine.org|accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref>

==Molecular basis of epigenetics==

Epigenetic changes can modify the activation of certain genes, but not the sequence of [[DNA]]. Additionally, the [[chromatin]] proteins associated with DNA may be activated or silenced. This is why the differentiated cells in a multi-cellular organism express only the genes that are necessary for their own activity. Epigenetic changes are preserved when cells divide. Most epigenetic changes only occur within the course of one individual organism's lifetime, but, if gene disactivation occurs in a sperm or egg cell that results in fertilization, then some epigenetic changes can be transferred to the next generation.<ref name="pmid17320501">{{cite journal | author = Chandler VL | title = Paramutation: from maize to mice | journal = Cell | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 641–5 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17320501 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.007 }}</ref> This raises the question of whether or not epigenetic changes in an organism can alter the basic structure of its DNA (see [[#Evolution|Evolution, below]]), a form of [[Lamarckism]].

Specific epigenetic processes include [[paramutation]], [[bookmarking]], [[Imprinting (genetics)|imprinting]], [[gene silencing]], [[X-inactivation|X chromosome inactivation]], [[position effect]], [[reprogramming]], [[transvection (genetics)|transvection]], [[maternal effect]]s, the progress of [[carcinogenesis]], many effects of [[teratogen]]s, regulation of [[histone]] modifications and [[heterochromatin]], and technical limitations affecting [[parthenogenesis]] and [[cloning]].

Epigenetic research uses a wide range of molecular biologic techniques to further our understanding of epigenetic phenomena, including [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] (together with its large-scale variants [[ChIP-on-chip]] and [[ChIP-Seq]]), [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]], methylation-sensitive [[restriction enzymes]], DNA adenine methyltransferase identification ([[DamID]]) and [[bisulfite sequencing]]. Furthermore, the use of [[bioinformatic]] methods is playing an increasing role ([[computational epigenetics]]).

===DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling===
[[Image:Nucleosome 1KX5 2.png|thumb|DNA associates with histone proteins to form chromatin.]]
Because the [[phenotype]] of a cell or individual is affected by which of its genes are transcribed, heritable [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription states]] can give rise to epigenetic effects. There are several layers of regulation of [[gene expression]].  One way that genes are regulated is through the remodeling of chromatin.  Chromatin is the complex of DNA and the [[histone]] proteins with which it associates.  Histone proteins are little spheres that DNA wraps around.  If the way that DNA is wrapped around the histones changes, gene expression can change as well.  Chromatin remodeling is accomplished through two main mechanisms:
# The first way is [[post translational modification]] of the amino acids that make up histone proteins.  Histone proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids.  If the amino acids that are in the chain are changed, the shape of the histone sphere might be modified. DNA is not completely unwound during replication.  It is possible, then, that the modified histones may be carried into each new copy of the DNA.  Once there, these histones may act as templates, initiating the surrounding new histones to be shaped in the new manner.  By altering the shape of the histones around it, these modified histones would ensure that a differentiated cell would stay differentiated, and not convert back into being a stem cell.
# The second way is the addition of methyl groups to the DNA, mostly at [[CpG site]]s, to convert [[cytosine]] to [[5-methylcytosine]].  5-Methylcytosine performs much like a regular cytosine, pairing up with a guanine. However, some areas of the genome are methylated more heavily than others, and highly methylated areas tend to be less transcriptionally active, through a mechanism not fully understood. Methylation of cytosines can also persist from the germ line of one of the parents into the zygote, marking the chromosome as being inherited from this parent ([[genetic imprinting]]).

The way that the cells stay differentiated in the case of DNA methylation is clearer to us than it is in the case of histone shape.  Basically, certain enzymes (such as [[DNA methyltransferase|DNMT1]]) have a higher affinity for the methylated cytosine.  If this enzyme reaches a "hemimethylated" portion of DNA (where methylcytosine is in only one of the two DNA strands) the enzyme will methylate the other half.

Although histone modifications occur throughout the entire sequence, the unstructured N-termini of histones (called histone tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include [[acetylation]], [[methylation]], [[ubiquitylation]], [[phosphorylation]] and [[sumoylation]]. Acetylation is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, acetylation of the K14 and K9 [[lysine]]s of the tail of histone H3 by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is generally correlated with transcriptional competence.

One mode of thinking is that this tendency of acetylation to be associated with "active" transcription is biophysical in nature. Because it normally has a positively charged nitrogen at its end, lysine can bind the negatively charged phosphates of the DNA backbone. The acetylation event converts the positively charged amine group on the side chain into a neutral amide linkage. This removes the positive charge, thus loosening the DNA from the histone. When this occurs, complexes like [[SWI/SNF]] and other transcriptional factors can bind to the DNA and allow transcription to occur.  This is the "cis" model of epigenetic function.  In other words, changes to the histone tails have a direct effect on the DNA itself.

Another model of epigenetic function is the "trans" model.  In this model changes to the histone tails act indirectly on the DNA.  For example, lysine acetylation may create a binding site for chromatin modifying enzymes (and basal transcription machinery as well).  This Chromatin Remodeler can then cause changes to the state of the chromatin.  Indeed, the bromodomain — a protein segment (domain) that specifically binds acetyl-lysine — is found in many enzymes that help activate transcription, including the [[SWI/SNF]] complex (on the protein polybromo). It may be that acetylation acts in this and the previous way to aid in transcriptional activation.

The idea that modifications act as docking modules for related factors is borne out by [[histone methylation]] as well. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin (constitutive [[heterochromatin]]). It has been determined that a chromodomain (a domain that specifically binds methyl-lysine) in the transcriptionally repressive protein [[Heterochromatin Protein 1|HP1]] recruits HP1 to K9 methylated regions. One example that seems to refute this biophysical model for methylation is that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with (and required for full) transcriptional activation. Tri-methylation in this case would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail.

It has been shown that the histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) is responsible for this methylation activity in the pattern of histones H3 & H4. This enzyme utilizes a catalytically active site called the SET domain (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax). The SET domain is a 130-amino acid sequence involved in modulating gene activities. This domain has been demonstrated to bind to the histone tail and causes the methylation of the histone.<ref name="pmid9487389">{{cite journal | author = Jenuwein T, Laible G, Dorn R, Reuter G | title = SET domain proteins modulate chromatin domains in eu- and heterochromatin | journal = Cell. Mol. Life Sci. | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–93 | year = 1998 | month = January | pmid = 9487389 | doi = 10.1007/s000180050127 }}</ref>

Differing histone modifications are likely to function in differing ways; acetylation at one position is likely to function differently than acetylation at another position. Also, multiple modifications may occur at the same time, and these modifications may work together to change the behavior of the nucleosome. The idea that multiple dynamic modifications regulate gene transcription in a systematic and reproducible way is called the [[histone code]].

DNA methylation frequently occurs in repeated sequences, and helps to suppress the expression and mobility of '[[transposable elements]]':<ref name="slotkin2007">{{cite journal | author = Slotkin RK, Martienssen R | title = Transposable elements and the epigenetic regulation of the genome | journal = Nat.

Epigenetic changes of this type thus have the potential to direct increased frequencies of permanent genetic mutation. [[DNA methylation]] patterns are known to be established and modified in response to environmental factors by a complex interplay of at least three independent [[DNA methyltransferase]]s, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, the loss of any of which is lethal in mice.<ref name="li92">{{cite journal | author = Li E, Bestor TH, Jaenisch R | title = Targeted mutation of the DNA methyltransferase gene results in embryonic lethality | journal = Cell | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 915–26 | year = 1992 | month = June | pmid = 1606615 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(92)90611-F }}</ref> DNMT1 is the most abundant methyltransferase in somatic cells,<ref name="robertson99">{{cite journal | author = Robertson KD, Uzvolgyi E, Liang G, Talmadge C, Sumegi J, Gonzales FA, Jones PA | title = The human DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 1, 3a and 3b: coordinate mRNA expression in normal tissues and overexpression in tumors | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 2291–8 | year = 1999 | month = June | pmid = 10325416 | pmc = 148793 | doi =  10.1093/nar/27.11.2291}}</ref> localizes to replication foci,<ref name="leonhardt92">{{cite journal | author = Leonhardt H, Page AW, Weier HU, Bestor TH | title = A targeting sequence directs DNA methyltransferase to sites of DNA replication in mammalian nuclei | journal = Cell | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 865–73 | year = 1992 | month = November | pmid = 1423634 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(92)90561-P }}</ref>  has a 10–40-fold preference for hemimethylated DNA and interacts with the [[proliferating cell nuclear antigen]] (PCNA).<ref name="chuang97">{{cite journal | author = Chuang LS, Ian HI, Koh TW, Ng HH, Xu G, Li BF | title = Human DNA-(cytosine-5) methyltransferase-PCNA complex as a target for p21WAF1 | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = 5334 | pages = 1996–2000 | year = 1997 | month = September | pmid = 9302295 | doi = 10.1126/science.277.5334.1996 }}</ref>

Histones H3 and H4 can also be manipulated through demethylation using histone lysine demethylase (KDM).  This recently identified enzyme has a catalytically active site called the Jumonji domain (JmjC).  The demethylation occurs when JmjC utilizes multiple cofactors to hydroxylate the methyl group, thereby removing it.  JmjC is capable of demethylating mono-, di-, and tri-methylated substrates.<ref name="pmid19234061">{{cite journal | author = Nottke A, Colaiácovo MP, Shi Y | title = Developmental roles of the histone lysine demethylases | journal = Development | volume = 136 | issue = 6 | pages = 879–89 | year = 2009 | month = March | pmid = 19234061 | pmc = 2692332 | doi = 10.1242/dev.020966 }}</ref>

Chromosomal regions can adopt stable and heritable alternative states resulting in bistable gene expression without changes to the DNA sequence.

Because DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling play such a central role in many types of epigenic inheritance, the word "epigenetics" is sometimes used as a synonym for these processes. However, this can be misleading. Chromatin remodeling is not always inherited, and not all epigenetic inheritance involves chromatin remodeling.<ref name="pmid17407749">{{cite journal | author = Ptashne M | title = On the use of the word 'epigenetic' | journal = Curr.

It has been suggested that the [[histone code]] could be mediated by the effect of small RNAs. The recent discovery and characterization of a vast array of small (21- to 26-nt), non-coding RNAs suggests that there is an RNA component, possibly involved in epigenetic gene regulation. [[Small interfering RNA]]s can modulate transcriptional gene expression via epigenetic modulation of targeted [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]]s.<ref name="Morris">{{cite book | author = Morris KL | title = RNA and the Regulation of Gene Expression: A Hidden Layer of Complexity | chapter = Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression | publisher = Caister Academic Press | location = Norfolk, England | year = 2008 | pages = | isbn = 1-904455-25-5 }}</ref>

===RNA transcripts and their encoded proteins===
Sometimes a gene, after being turned on, transcribes a product that (either directly or indirectly) maintains the activity of that gene. For example, [[Hnf4]] and [[MyoD]] enhance the transcription of many liver- and muscle-specific genes, respectively, including their own, through the [[transcription factor]] activity of the [[proteins]] they encode. RNA signalling includes differential recruitment of a hierarchy of generic chromatin modifying complexes and DNA methyltransferases to specific loci by RNAs during differentiation and development.<ref name="pmid19154003">{{cite journal | author = Mattick JS, Amaral PP, Dinger ME, Mercer TR, Mehler MF | title = RNA regulation of epigenetic processes | journal = BioEssays | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–9 | year = 2009 | month = January | pmid = 19154003 | doi = 10.1002/bies.080099 }}</ref> Other epigenetic changes are mediated by the production of [[alternative splicing|different splice forms]] of [[RNA]], or by formation of double-stranded RNA ([[RNAi]]). Descendants of the cell in which the gene was turned on will inherit this activity, even if the original stimulus for gene-activation is no longer present. These genes are most often turned on or off by [[signal transduction]], although in some systems where [[syncytia]] or [[gap junctions]] are important, RNA may spread directly to other cells or nuclei by [[diffusion]]. A large amount of RNA and protein is contributed to the [[zygote]] by the mother during [[oogenesis]] or via [[nurse cell]]s, resulting in [[maternal effect]] phenotypes. A smaller quantity of sperm RNA is transmitted from the father, but there is recent evidence that this epigenetic information can lead to visible changes in several generations of offspring.<ref name="choi06">{{cite web | author= Choi CQ | title=The Scientist: RNA can be hereditary molecule | publisher = The Scientist | url=http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/23494 | date=2006-05-25 | accessdate = 2006 }}</ref>

===MicroRNAs===
[[MicroRNA]]s (miRNAs) are members of [[non-coding RNA]]s that range in size from 17 to 25 nucleotides.  As indicated by Wang et al.,<ref name=Wang>Wang Z, Yao H, Lin S, Zhu X, Shen Z, Lu G, Poon WS, Xie D, Lin MC, Kung HF (2012). Transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of human microRNAs. Cancer Lett 331(1):1-10. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2012.12.006. PMID 3246373</ref> miRNAs regulate a large variety of biological functions.  So far, in 2013, about 2000 miRNAs have been discovered in humans and these can be found online in an miRNA database.<ref>http://www.mirbase.org/cgi-bin/browse.pl</ref> Each miRNA expressed in a cell may target about 100 to 200 messenger RNAs that it downregulates.<ref>Lim LP, Lau NC, Garrett-Engele P, Grimson A, Schelter JM, Castle J, Bartel DP, Linsley PS, Johnson JM (2005). Microarray analysis shows that some microRNAs downregulate large numbers of target mRNAs. Nature 433(7027):769-773. PMID 15685193</ref> Most of the downregulation of mRNAs occurs by causing the decay of the targeted mRNA, while some downregulation occurs at the level of translation into protein.<ref>Lee D, Shin C (2012). MicroRNA-target interactions: new insights from genome-wide approaches. Ann N Y Acad Sci 1271:118-28. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06745.x. Review. PMID 23050973</ref> 

It appears that about 60% of human protein coding genes are regulated by miRNAs.<ref>Friedman RC, Farh KK, Burge CB, Bartel DP (2009). Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs.

PMID 15952895</ref>  Other miRNAs are epigenetically regulated by either histone modifications or by combined DNA methylation and histone modification.<ref name=Wang />

===Prions===
{{details|Fungal prions}}
[[Prion]]s are [[Infection|infectious]] forms of [[protein]]s. In general, proteins fold into discrete units that perform distinct cellular functions, but some proteins are also capable of forming an infectious conformational state known as a prion.  Although often viewed in the context of [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|infectious disease]], prions are more loosely defined by their ability to catalytically convert other native state versions of the same protein to an infectious conformational state.  It is in this latter sense that they can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a phenotypic change without a modification of the genome.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Epigenetic inheritance and prions| author=Yool A, Edmunds WJ| journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | year = 1998 | pages = 241–242 | volume=11 | doi = 10.1007/s000360050085 | issue=2}}</ref>

[[Fungal prion]]s are considered epigenetic because the infectious phenotype caused by the prion can be inherited without modification of the genome.  [[PSI (prion)|PSI+]] and URE3, discovered in [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]] in 1965 and 1971, are the two best studied of this type of prion.<ref>{{cite journal|title=[PSI], a cytoplasmic suppressor of super-suppression in yeast | author = Cox BS| journal = Heredity | volume = 20 | pages = 505–521 | year = 1965 | doi = 10.1038/hdy.1965.65 | issue = 4}}</ref><ref name="pmid5573734">{{cite journal | author = Lacroute F | title = Non-Mendelian mutation allowing ureidosuccinic acid uptake in yeast | journal = J.

===Structural inheritance systems===
{{details|Structural inheritance}}

In [[ciliate]]s such as ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' and ''[[Paramecium]]'', genetically identical cells show heritable differences in the patterns of ciliary rows on their cell surface. Experimentally altered patterns can be transmitted to daughter cells. It seems existing structures act as templates for new structures. The mechanisms of such inheritance are unclear, but reasons exist to assume that multicellular organisms also use existing cell structures to assemble new ones.<ref name="pmid1804215">{{cite journal | author = Sapp J | title = Concepts of organization.

==Functions and consequences==

===Development===
Somatic epigenetic inheritance through [[epigenetic modifications]], particularly through DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling, is very important in the development of multicellular eukaryotic organisms.  The genome sequence is static (with some notable exceptions), but cells differentiate into many different types, which perform different functions, and respond differently to the environment and intercellular signalling.  Thus, as individuals develop, [[morphogen]]s activate or silence genes in an epigenetically heritable fashion, giving cells a "memory".  In mammals, most cells terminally differentiate, with only [[stem cells]] retaining the ability to differentiate into several cell types ("totipotency" and "multipotency").  In [[mammal]]s, some stem cells continue producing new differentiated cells throughout life, but mammals are not able to respond to loss of some tissues, for example, the inability to regenerate limbs, which some other animals are capable of.  Unlike animals, plant cells do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant.  While plants do utilise many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as [[chromatin remodeling]], it has been hypothesised that some kinds of plant cells do not use or require "cellular memories", resetting their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their fate.<ref name="pmid17194589">{{cite journal | author = Costa S, Shaw P | title = 'Open minded' cells: how cells can change fate | journal = Trends Cell Biol. | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 101–6 | year = 2007 | month = March | pmid = 17194589 | doi = 10.1016/j.tcb.2006.12.005 | url= http://cromatina.icb.ufmg.br/biomol/seminarios/outros/grupo_open.pdf | format=PDF | quote= This might suggest that plant cells do not use or require a cellular memory mechanism and just respond to positional information. However, it has been shown that plants do use cellular memory mechanisms mediated by PcG proteins in several processes, ... (p.104)}}</ref>

Epigenetics can be divided into predetermined and probabilistic epigenesis. Predetermined epigenesis is a unidirectional movement from structural development in DNA  to the functional maturation of the protein. "Predetermined" here means that development is scripted and predictable. Probabilistic epigenesis on the other hand is a bidirectional structure-function development with experiences and external molding development.<ref name=Griesemer_2005>{{cite journal | author = Griesemer J, Haber MH, Yamashita G, Gannett L | title = Critical Notice: Cycles of Contingency – Developmental Systems and Evolution | journal = Biology & Philosophy | year = 2005 | month = March | volume = 20 | issue =2–3 | pages = 517–544 | doi = 10.1007/s10539-004-0836-4}}</ref>

===Medicine===
Epigenetics has many and varied potential medical applications as it tends to be multidimensional in nature.<ref name="pmid21447282">{{cite journal | author = Chahwan R, Wontakal SN, Roa S | title = The multidimensional nature of epigenetic information and its role in disease | journal = Discov Med | volume = 11 | issue = 58 | pages = 233–43 | year = 2011 | month = March | pmid = 21447282 | doi = }}</ref> Congenital genetic disease is well understood, and it is also clear that epigenetics can play a role, for example, in the case of [[Angelman syndrome]] and [[Prader-Willi syndrome]].  These are normal genetic diseases caused by gene deletions or inactivation of the genes, but are unusually common because individuals are essentially [[hemizygous]] because of [[genomic imprinting]], and therefore a single gene knock out is sufficient to cause the disease, where most cases would require both copies to be knocked out.<ref>{{OMIM|105830}}</ref>

===Evolution===
Epigenetics can impact evolution when epigenetic changes are heritable. A sequestered germ line or [[Weismann barrier]] is specific to animals, and epigenetic inheritance is more common in plants and microbes.

===Cancer and developmental abnormalities===
A variety of compounds are considered as epigenetic [[carcinogens]]—they result in an increased incidence of tumors, but they do not show [[mutagenic|mutagen]] activity (toxic compounds or pathogens that cause tumors incident to increased regeneration should also be excluded). Examples include [[diethylstilbestrol]], [[arsenite]], [[hexachlorobenzene]], and [[nickel]] compounds.

In 2008, the National Institutes of Health announced that $190 million had been earmarked for epigenetics research over the next five years. In announcing the funding, government officials noted that epigenetics has the potential to explain mechanisms of aging, human development, and the origins of cancer, heart disease, mental illness, as well as several other conditions. Some investigators, like Randy Jirtle, PhD, of Duke University Medical Center, think epigenetics may ultimately turn out to have a greater role in disease than genetics.<ref>{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Beil |title= Medicine's New Epicenter?

====DNA methylation in cancer====
[[DNA methylation]] is an important regulator of gene transcription and a large body of evidence has demonstrated that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with unscheduled gene silencing, and the genes with high levels of 5-methylcytosine in their promoter region are transcriptionally silent. DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are in general transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been associated with a large number of human malignancies and found in two distinct forms: hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue. Hypermethylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications that repress transcription via promoter region of tumour suppressor genes. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms.<ref name= CraigJMWongNC>{{cite book | author = Wong NC, Craig JM | title = Epigenetics: A Reference Manual | publisher = Caister Academic Press | location = Norfolk, England | year = 2011 | pages = | isbn = 1-904455-88-3  }}</ref>

====DNA repair epigenetics in cancer====

Germ line (familial) mutations have been identified in 34 different DNA repair genes that cause a high risk of cancer, including, for example [[BRCA1]] and [[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]]. These are listed in the article [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder]].  However, cancers caused by such germ line mutations make up only a very small proportion of cancers.  For instance, germ line mutations cause only 2% to 5% of colon cancer cases.<ref>Jasperson KW, Tuohy TM, Neklason DW, Burt RW (2010). Hereditary and familial colon cancer. Gastroenterology 138(6):2044-2058. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2010.01.054. PMID 20420945</ref>  

Epigenetic reductions in expression of DNA repair genes, however, are very frequent in sporadic (non-germ line) cancers, as shown among some representative cancers in the table in this section, while mutations in DNA repair genes in sporadic cancer are very rare.<ref>Wood LD, Parsons DW, Jones S, Lin J, Sjöblom T, Leary RJ, Shen D, Boca SM, Barber T, Ptak J, Silliman N, Szabo S, Dezso Z, Ustyanksky V, Nikolskaya T, Nikolsky Y, Karchin R, Wilson PA, Kaminker JS, Zhang Z, Croshaw R, Willis J, Dawson D, Shipitsin M, Willson JK, Sukumar S, Polyak K, Park BH, Pethiyagoda CL, Pant PV, Ballinger DG, Sparks AB, Hartigan J, Smith DR, Suh E, Papadopoulos N, Buckhaults P, Markowitz SD, Parmigiani G, Kinzler KW, Velculescu VE, Vogelstein B (2007).

====Variant histones H2A in cancer====
The [[histone]] variants of the H2A family are highly conserved in mammals, playing critical roles in regulating many nuclear processes by altering [[chromatin]] structure. One of the key H2A variants, H2A.X, marks DNA damage, facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to restore genomic integrity. Another variant, H2A.Z, plays an important role in both gene activation and repression. A high level of H2A.Z expression is ubiquitously detected in many cancers and is significantly associated with cellular proliferation and genomic instability.<ref name="CraigJMWongNC"/>

A study conducted on AML patients showed that the use of chemotherapy together with a combination of a DNA methyltransferase (such as epigallocatechingallate [EGCG]) and a histone deacetylase inhibitor (such as valproic acid [VPA]) can distinctively modify the malignant transcriptome of AML blasts by inhibiting DNA hypermethylation and histone acetylation and can confer a positive prognostic impact on AML patients.<ref>http://physiology.eajbs.eg.net/pdf/vol2.n2/13.pdf</ref>

==Epigenetics in microorganisms==
[[Image:Escherichia coli flagella TEM.png|thumb|150px|Escherichia coli bacteria]]
Bacteria make widespread use of postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Bacteria make use of DNA [[adenine]] methylation (rather than DNA [[cytosine]] methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]], [[Vibrio]], [[Yersinia]], [[Haemophilus]]'', and ''[[Brucella]]''. In ''[[Alphaproteobacteria]]'', methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In ''[[Gammaproteobacteria]]'', adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage, transposase activity and regulation of gene expression.<ref name="Casadesus">{{cite journal | author = Casadesús J, Low D | title = Epigenetic gene regulation in the bacterial world | journal = Microbiol.

The filamentous fungus ''Neurospora crassa'' is a prominent model system for understanding the control and function of cytosine methylation. In this organisms, DNA methylation is associated with relics of a genome defense system called RIP (repeat-induced point mutation) and silences gene expression by inhibiting transcription elongation.<ref name="pmid19092133">{{cite journal | author = Lewis ZA, Honda S, Khlafallah TK, Jeffress JK, Freitag M, Mohn F, Schübeler D, Selker EU | title = Relics of repeat-induced point mutation direct heterochromatin formation in Neurospora crassa | journal = Genome Res. | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 427–37 | year = 2009 | month = March | pmid = 19092133 | pmc = 2661801 | doi = 10.1101/gr.086231.108 }}</ref>

The [[yeast]] [[prion]] PSI is generated by a conformational change of a translation termination factor, which is then inherited by daughter cells. This can provide a survival advantage under adverse conditions. This is an example of epigenetic regulation enabling unicellular organisms to respond rapidly to environmental stress. Prions can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a phenotypic change without modification of the genome.<ref name=JorgTost>{{cite book | author = Jorg Tost | title = Epigenetics | publisher = Caister Academic Press | location = Norfolk, England | year = 2008 | pages = | isbn = 1-904455-23-9  }}</ref>
