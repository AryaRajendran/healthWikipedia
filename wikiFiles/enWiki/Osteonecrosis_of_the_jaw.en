'''[[Osteonecrosis]] of the [[jaw]]''' ('''ONJ''') is a severe [[bone]] disease that affects the [[maxilla]] and the [[Human mandible|mandible]]. Various forms of ONJ have been described over the last 160 years, and a number of causes have been suggested in the literature.
Osteonecrosis of the jaws associated with bisphosphonate therapy, required by some cancer treatment regimens, has been identified and defined as a pathological entity since 2003.<ref name="RevistaOMF">

==Signs and symptoms==
The definitive symptom of ONJ is the exposure of [[Human mandible|mandibular]] or [[maxilla]]ry bone through lesions in the [[gingiva]] that do not heal.<ref name="JBMR-2007">[http://wwwlb.aub.edu.lb/~webcmop/ONJ%20JBMR%202007.pdf JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH, 2007, Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw: Report of a Task Force of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research]</ref> Pain, inflammation of the surrounding soft tissue, secondary infection or drainage may or may not be present. The development of lesions is most frequent after invasive dental procedures, such as extractions, but is also known to occur spontaneously. There may be no symptoms for weeks or months, until lesions with exposed bone appear.<ref name="ADA-1">[http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/topics/osteonecrosis.asp American Dental Association, Osteonecrosis of the Jaw]</ref> Lesions are more common on the mandible than the maxilla.

==Causes==
===Toxic agents===
Other factors such as toxicants can adversely impact bone cells. Infections, chronic or acute, can affect blood flow by inducing platelet activation and aggregation, contributing to a localized state of excess coagulability ([[hypercoagulability]]) that may contribute to clot formation ([[thrombosis]]), a known cause of bone infarct and ischaemia. Exogenous estrogens, also called hormonal disruptors, have also been linked with an increased tendency to clot ([[thrombophilia]]) and impaired bone healing.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Glueck C | coauthors = McMahon R; Bouquot J; Triplett D | title = Exogenous estrogen may exacerbate thrombophilia, impair bone healing and contribute to development of chronic facial pain. | journal = Cranio | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 143–53 | year = 1998 | pmid=9852807}}</ref>

[[Heavy metals]] such as [[lead]] and [[cadmium]] have been implicated in osteoporosis. Cadmium and lead also promotes the synthesis of [[plasminogen activator inhibitor-1]] (PAI-1) which is the major inhibitor of [[fibrinolysis]] ( the mechanism by which the body breaks down clots ) and shown to be a cause of hypofibrinolysis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yamamoto C | title = [Toxicity of cadmium and lead on vascular cells that regulate fibrinolysis] | journal = Yakugaku Zasshi | volume = 120 | issue = 5 | pages = 463–73 | year = 2000 | month=May | pmid=10825810}}</ref> Persistent blot clots can lead to congestive blood flow ([[hyperemia]]) in bone marrow, impaired blood flow and ischaemia in bone tissue resulting in lack of oxygen ([[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]), bone cell damage and eventual cell death ([[apoptosis]]). Of significance is the fact that the average concentration of cadmium in human bones in the 20th century has increased to about 10 times above the pre-industrial level.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jaworowski Z | coauthors = Barbalat F; Blain C; Peyre E |title=Heavy metals in human and animal bones from ancient and contemporary France |journal=Sci.

[[Ethanol]] both from exogenous and endogenous sources and, its more toxic [[metabolite]], [[acetaldehyde]], have also been implicated in both osteoporosis and osteonecrosis. Acetaldehyde, a highly toxic metabolite of ethanol, can play a role in hypoxia and inhibit the osteoblastogenic potential of the bone marrow.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.1999.tb04126.x | author = Giuliani N | coauthors = Girasole G; Vescovi P; Passeri G; Pedrazzoni M | title = Ethanol and acetaldehyde inhibit the formation of early [[osteoblast]] progenitors in murine and human bone marrow cultures | journal = Alcohol Clin Exp Res | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 381–5 | year = 1999 | month=February | pmid=10069572}}</ref> Ethanol has been shown to alter the epithelial barrier through ethanol [[oxidation]] into acetaldehyde by the colonic microflora and downstream [[mast cell]] activation.

The effects of chronic gut dysbiosis and long term exposure to low levels of endogenous acetaldehyde on bone tissue and hepatic function is not yet fully understood. However Cordts ''et al.'' suggested in 2001 that gut dysbiosis (as indicated by stool yeast) and [[hepatic]] detoxification challenge pathway exhaustion may lead to subclinical, systemic inflammation and chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). CVI is a pathological condition caused either by the congenital absence of or damage to [[Vein|venous valves]] in the superficial and communicating systems. Venous incompetence due to [[Thrombus|thrombi]] and formation of thrombi favoured by the Virchow triad (venous stasis, hypercoagulability, endothelial trauma) also can cause CVI.<ref name="pmid11668378">{{cite journal | author = Cordts PR | coauthors = Kaminski MV; Raju S; Clark MR; Woo KM |title=Could gut-liver function derangements cause chronic venous insufficiency? |journal=Vasc Surg |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=107–14 |year=2001 |pmid=11668378 |doi=10.1177/153857440103500204 }}</ref>

===Bisphosphonates===
{{Main|Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw}}
The first three cases of [[bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw]] were spontaneously reported to the FDA by an oral surgeon in 2002, with the toxicity being described as a potentially late toxicity of chemotherapy.<ref name="pmid15485717"/> In 2003 and 2004, three oral surgeons independently reported to the FDA information on 104 cancer patients with bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw seen in their referral practices in California, Florida, and New York.<ref name="pmid16427751"/><ref name="pmid11668378"/><ref name="Marcus"/> These case series were published as peer-reviewed articles- two in the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and one in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Subsequently, numerous instances of persons with this ADR were reported to the manufacturers and to the FDA. By December 2006, 3607 cases of persons with this ADR had been reported to the FDA and 2227 cases had been reported to the manufacturer of intravenous bisphosphonates.

[[File:TimelineONJ1.jpg|thumb]]

The International Myeloma Foundation's web-based survey included 1203 respondents, 904 patients with myeloma and 299 with breast cancer and an estimate that after 36 months, osteonecrosis of the jaw had been diagnosed in 10% of 211 patients on zoledronate and 4% of 413 on pamidronate.<ref name="Bullough"/> A population based study in Germany identified more than 300 cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw, 97% occurring in cancer patients (on high-dose intravenous bisphosphonates), and 3 cases in 780,000 patients with osteoporosis for an incidence of 0.00038%. Time to event ranged from 23–39 months and 42–46 months with high dose intravenous and oral bisphosphonates.<ref name="eMedicine"/> A prospective, population based study by Mavrokokki ''et al.''. estimated an incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw of 1.15% for intravenous bisphosphonates and 0.04% for oral bisphosphonates. Most cases (73%) were precipitated by [[dental extraction]]s. In contrast, safety studies sponsored by the manufacturer reported bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw rates that were much lower.
Although the majority of cases of ONJ have occurred in cancer patients receiving high dose intravenous bisphosphonates, almost 800 cases have been reported in oral bisphosphonate users for osteoporosis or Pagets disease. In terms of severity most cases of ONJ in oral bisphosphonate users are stage 1–2 and tend to progress to resolution with conservative measures such as oral [[chlorhexidine]] rinses.

In the past few years, thousands of cases of ONJ in patients on [[bisphosphonate]] therapy have been diagnosed usually following lack of healing after a dental extraction but also in cases of spontaneous exposure of the cortical bone tissue through the gingiva and mucosa.<ref>[http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/articles/fosamax.html "Fosamax does more harm then good"]. 14 April 2006.</ref><ref name="pmid16568881">{{cite journal | author = Hay KD | coauthors = Bishop PA |title=Association of osteonecrosis of the jaws and bisphosphonate pharmacotherapy: dental implications |journal=N Z Dent J |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=4–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16568881 }}</ref> Owing to prolonged embedding of bisphosphonate drugs in the bone tissues, the risk for BRONJ is high even after stopping the administration of the medication for several years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zadik Y, Abu-Tair J, Yarom N, Zaharia B, Elad S. |title=The importance of a thorough medical and pharmacological history before dental implant placement. |journal=Aust Dent J |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=388–392 |year=2012 |month=September |pmid=22924366 |doi=10.1111/j.1834-7819.2012.01717.x}}</ref>

The recent increase of such cases has been linked with a major emphasis on the therapeutic use of bisphosphonates for osteoporosis, especially since hormone replacement therapy has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer, clots and cardiovascular disease in women following the 2003 findings of the U.S. Women's Health Initiative study.<ref name="pmid12771114">{{cite journal | author = Wassertheil-Smoller S | coauthors = Hendrix SL; Limacher M; ''et al.'' |title=Effect of estrogen plus progestin on stroke in postmenopausal women: the Women's Health Initiative: a randomized trial |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=20 |pages=2673–84 |year=2003 |pmid=12771114 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.20.2673}}</ref> Two classes of [[bisphosphonate]]s are presently prescribed:

*Non-[[nitrogen]] containing bisphosphonates such as [[etidronic acid|etidronate]] (Didronel, [[Procter & Gamble|Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals]])
*Nitrogen containing such as [[alendronate]] (Fosamax, [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]), [[pamidronic acid|pamidronate]] (Aredia, [[Novartis]]), [[zoledronate]] (Zometa, Novartis), [[risedronate]] (Actonel, Procter & Gamble) and [[ibandronic acid|ibandronate]] (Boniva, [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche Laboratories]]).

The nitrogen containing bisphosphonates are the most potent inhibitors and no case of ONJ associated with etidronate has been reported yet. The main pharmacological action of bisphosphonates is inhibition of the osteoclast driven bone resorption. This is achieved by shortening osteoclast lifespan via apoptosis and by inhibiting osteoclast activity and recruitment on the bone surface (61). When a bisphosphonate binds to bone mineral, osteoclasts resorb both bone and the bound bisphosphonate. During bone formation, if any, bisphosphonate remaining on the surface of the bone is covered and remains there until future osteoclastic bone resorption at the site. This explains why inhibition of bone resorption continues long after bisphosphonate treatment has been discontinued.<ref name="pmid12925603">{{cite journal | author = Rodan GA | coauthors = Reszka AA |title=Osteoporosis and bisphosphonates |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=85-A |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=8–12 |year=2003 |pmid=12925603 }}</ref>

This form of therapy has been shown to prevent loss of bone mineral density (BMD) as a result of a reduction in bone turnover. However bone health entails quite a bit more than just BMD. There are many other factors to consider.

In healthy bone tissue there is a [[homeostasis]] between [[bone resorption]] and bone apposition. Diseased or damaged bone is resorbed through the [[osteoclast]]s mediated process while [[osteoblast]]s form new bone to replace it, thus maintaining healthy [[bone density]]. This process is commonly called remodelling.

However osteoporosis is essentially the result of a lack of new bone formation in combination with bone resorption in reactive hyperemia, related to various etiological and contributing factors, and bisphosphonates do not address these factors at all.

An individual who is already having problems with osteoporosis/ osteonecrosis of the jaws due to the effects of these etiological factors will be more susceptible to the adverse effects of bisphosphonates. In theory, by suppressing osteoclastic activity and bone resorption, any ischaemic-damaged bone will be left [[in situ]] instead of being resorbed. The damaged bone will not be repaired either if the factors already inhibiting osteoblastic activity are still present. Therefore the amount of osteonecrotic tissue should be expected to increase until it reaches a level when any trauma or insult to this necrotic bone will result in extremely poor healing, exposed necrotic bone to the oral environment, development of pain, and increased risks of microbial infection, as effectively seen in bisphosphonate-associated cases of ONJ. Recently, a proposal incorporating both the reduced bone turnover and the infectious elements of previous theories has been put forward, which cites the impaired functionality of affected macrophages as the dominant factor in the development of ONJ.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pazianas M |title=Osteonecrosis of the jaw and the role of macrophages |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=103 |issue=3 |pages=232–40 |year=2011 |month=February |pmid=21189409 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djq516 |url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/103/3/232.full.pdf }}</ref>

In a systematic review of cases of bisphosphonate-associated ONJ up to 2006, it was concluded that the [[Human mandible|mandible]] is more commonly affected than the [[maxilla]] (2:1 ratio), and 60% of cases are preceded by a dental surgical procedure. According to Woo, Hellstein and Kalmar, oversuppression of bone turnover is probably the primary mechanism for the development of this form of ONJ, although there may be contributing [[co-morbid]] factors (as discussed elsewhere in this article). It is recommended that all sites of potential jaw infection should be eliminated before bisphosphonate therapy is initiated in these patients to reduce the necessity of subsequent dentoalveolar surgery. The degree of risk for osteonecrosis in patients taking oral bisphosphonates, such as [[alendronate]] (Fosamax), for osteoporosis is uncertain and warrants careful monitoring.<ref name="pmid16702591">{{cite journal | author = Woo SB | coauthors = Hellstein JW; Kalmar JR |title=Narrative [corrected] review: bisphosphonates and osteonecrosis of the jaws |journal=Ann.

[[Matrix metalloproteinase]] 2 may be a candidate gene for [[Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw]], since it is the only gene known to be associated with bone abnormalities and atrial fibrillation, both of which are side effects of [[bisphosphonates]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lehrer S | coauthors = Montazem A; Ramanathan L; ''et al.'' |title=Bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaws, bone markers, and a hypothesized candidate gene |journal=J.

==Pathophysiology==
===Histopathological alterations===
Persons with ONJ may have either necrotic bone or [[bone marrow]] that has been slowly [[strangulated]] or nutrient-starved. Bone with chronically poor blood flow develops either a [[fibrous]] marrow since fibres can more easily live in nutrient starved areas, a greasy, dead fatty marrow (wet rot), a very dry, sometimes leathery marrow (dry rot), or a completely hollow marrow space (osteocavitation), also typical of ONJ. The blood flow impairment occurs following a bone [[infarct]], a blood clot forming inside the smaller blood vessels of cancellous bone tissue.

Under ischaemic conditions numerous [[pathological]] changes in the bone marrow and trabeculae of oral cancellous bone have been documented. Microscopically, areas of ''"apparent fatty degeneration and/or necrosis, often with pooled fat from destroyed [[adipose cell]]s (oil cysts) and with marrow fibrosis (reticular fatty degeneration)"'' are seen. These changes are present even if ''"most bony trabeculae appear at first glance viable, mature and otherwise normal, but closer inspection demonstrates focal loss of [[osteocyte]]s and variable micro cracking (splitting along natural cleavage planes). The microscopic features are similar to those of ischaemic or aseptic osteonecrosis of long bones, [[corticosteroid]]-induced osteonecrosis, and the osteomyelitis of caisson (deep-sea diver's) disease"''.<ref>{{Cite book| author = Neville BW | coauthors = Damn D; Allen C; Bouquot JE |chapter=Facial pain and neuromuscular diseases. |title=Oral and maxillofacial pathology |publisher=W.B Saunders Co |year=1995 |pages=631–632}}</ref>

In the cancellous portion of femoral head it is not uncommon to find [[trabeculae]] with apparently intact [[osteocyte]]s which seem to be "alive" but are no longer synthetizing [[collagen]]. This appears to be consistent with the findings in alveolar [[cancellous bone]].<ref>{{Cite book| author = Arlet J | coauthors = Durroux R; Fauchier C; Thiechart M |chapter=Topographic and evolutive aspects |title=Histophatology of the nontraumatic necrosis of the femoral head |editor=Arlet J, Ficat PR, Hungerford DS. (eds)}}</ref>

Osteonecrosis can affect any bone, but the hips, knees and jaws are most often involved. Pain can often be severe, especially if teeth and/or a branch of the [[trigeminal nerve]] is involved, but many patients do not experience pain, at least in the earlier stages. When severe facial pain is involved, the term NICO, for [[Neuralgia-inducing cavitational osteonecrosis]], is frequently used.

ONJ, even in its mild or minor forms, creates a marrow environment that is conducive to bacterial growth. Since many individuals have low-grade infections of the teeth and gums, this probably is one of the major mechanisms by which the marrow blood flow problem can worsen; any local infection / [[inflammation]] will cause increased pressures and clotting in the area involved. No other bones have this mechanism as a major risk factor for osteonecrosis. A wide variety of [[bacteria]] have been cultured from ONJ lesions. Typically, they are the same [[microorganisms]] as those found in [[periodontitis]] or devitalized teeth. However, according to special staining of [[biopsy|biopsied]] tissues, bacterial elements are rarely found in large numbers. So while ONJ is not primarily an infection, many cases have a secondary, very low-level of bacterial infection and chronic non-suppurative [[osteomyelitis]] can be associated with ONJ. [[Fungal]] infections in the involved bone do not seem to be a problem, but viral infections have not been studied. Some viruses, such as the [[smallpox]] virus (no longer existent in the wild) can produce osteonecrosis.

===Effects of persistent ischaemia on bone cells===
[[Cortical bone]] is well vascularized by the surrounding soft tissues thus less susceptible to ischaemic damage.

The rapidity with which premature cell death can occur depends on the cell type and the degree and duration of the [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]]. [[pluripotential hemopoietic stem cell|haematopoietic cells]], in bone marrow, are sensitive to anoxia and are the first to die after reduction or removal of the blood supply. In anoxic conditions they usually die within 12 hours. Experimental evidence suggests that bone cells composed of osteocytes, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts die within 12–48 hours, and marrow fat cells die within 120 hours.<ref name="eMedicine">{{eMedicine|radio|86|Bone infarct}}</ref> The death of bone does not alter its radiographic opacity nor its mineral density. Necrotic bone does not undergo resorption; therefore, it appears relatively more opaque.

Attempts at repair of ischaemic-damaged bone will usual occur in 2 phases. First, when dead bone abuts live marrow, [[capillaries]] and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells grow into the dead marrow spaces, while [[macrophages]] degrade dead cellular and fat debris. Second, mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts or fibroblasts. Under favorable conditions, layers of new bone form on the surface of dead spongy [[trabeculae]]. If sufficiently thickened, these layers may decrease the [[radiodensity]] of the bone; therefore, the first [[radiographic]] evidence of previous osteonecrosis may be patchy [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]] resulting from repair. Under unfavorable conditions repeated attempts at repair in ischaemic conditions can be seen [[Histology|histologically]] and are characterized by extensive delamination or microcracking along cement lines as well as the formation of excessive cement lines.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Adams WR | coauthors = Spolnik KJ; Bouquot JE |title=Maxillofacial osteonecrosis in a patient with multiple "idiopathic" facial pains |journal=J.

==Treatment==
The treatment should be tailored to the individual patient according to the etiological factors involved and the severity of the disease process. With oral osteoporosis the emphasis should be on good [[nutrient]] absorption and metabolic wastes elimination through a healthy gastro-intestinal function, effective hepatic [[metabolism]] of toxicants such as exogenous estrogens, endogenous acetaldehyde and heavy metals, a balanced diet, healthy lifestyle, assessment of factors related to potential [[Coagulopathy|coagulopathies]], and treatment of periodontal diseases and other oral and dental infections.

In cases of advanced oral ischaemic osteoporosis and/or ONJ that are not bisphosphonates related, clinical evidence has shown that surgically removing the damaged marrow, usually by [[curettage]] and decortication, will eliminate the problem (and the pain) in 74% of patients with jaw involvement.<ref name="Bouquot1995"/> Repeat surgeries, usually smaller procedures than the first, may be required, and almost a third of jawbone patients will need surgery in one or more other parts of the jaws because the disease so frequently present multiple lesions, i.e. multiple sites in the same or similar bones, with normal marrow in between. In the hip, at least half of all patients will get the disease in the opposite hip over time; this pattern occurs in the jaws as well. Recently, it has been found that some osteonecrosis patients respond to anticoagulation therapies alone. The earlier the diagnosis the better the prognosis. Research is ongoing on other non-surgical therapeutic modalities that could alone or in combination with surgery further improve the prognosis and reduce the morbidity of ONJ. A greater emphasis on minimizing or correcting known etiological factors is necessary while further research is conducted on chronic ischaemic bone diseases such as oral osteoporosis and ONJ.

==History==
ONJ is not a new disease, around 1850 various forms of "chemical osteomyelitis" resulting from environmental pollutants, such as lead and the [[white phosphorus]] used in early (non-safety) matches ([[Phossy jaw]]), as well as from popular medications containing [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]] or [[bismuth]], were reported in the literature.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Bond TE Jr. |title=A practical treatise on dental medicine |publisher=Lindsay & Blakiston |location=Philadelphia |year=1848 }}</ref><ref name="ONJ_Lucifer matches">{{cite journal |title=Necrosis of the lower jaw in makers of Lucifer matches |journal=Am J Dent Science |volume=1 |issue=series 3 |pages=96–7 |year=1867}}</ref><ref name="MCDR-HistoryONJ">[http://www.maxillofacialcenter.com/NICOhistory.html "The History of Maxillofacial Osteonecrosis (NICO)"].

This disease apparently did not often occur in individuals with good gingival health, and usually targeted the mandible first.<ref name="ONJ_Lucifer matches"/> It was associated with localized or generalized deep ache or pain, often of multiple jawbone sites. The teeth often appeared sound and suppuration was not present. Even so, the dentist often began extracting one tooth after another in the region of pain, often with temporary relief but usually to no real effect.<ref name="MCDR-HistoryONJ"/>

Today a growing body of scientific evidence indicate that this disease process, in the cancellous bone and bone marrow, is caused by bone [[infarct]]s mediated by a range of local and systemic factors. Bone infarcts as well as damage to the deeper portion of the cancellous bone is an insidious process. It is certainly not visible clinically and routine imaging techniques such as radiographs are not effective for that sort of damage. ''"An important and often incompletely understood principle of radiography is the amount of bone destruction that goes undetected by routine x-rays procedures; this has been demonstrated by numerous investigators. Destruction confined to the cancellous portion of the bone cannot be detected radiographically, ad radiolucencies appear only when there is internal or external erosion or destruction of the bone cortex."''<ref>{{Cite book| author = Burns RC | coauthors = Cohen S |title=Pathways of the pulp |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis, MO |year=1980 |pages=55–7 |isbn=978-0-8016-1009-7 |edition=2nd }}</ref> In fact no radiographic findings are specific for bone infarction / osteonecrosis. A variety of pathologies may mimic bone infarction, including stress fractures, infections, inflammations, and metabolic and neoplastic processes. The limitations apply to all imaging modalities, including plain [[radiography]], [[radionuclide]] studies, [[CT scans]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). Through-transmission alveolar ultrasound, based on quantitative ultrasound (QUS) in combination with panoramic dental radiography ([[orthopantomography]]) is helpful in assessing changes in jawbone density.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Imbeau J | title = Introduction to through-transmission alveolar ultrasonography (TAU) in dental medicine | journal = Cranio | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 100–12 | year = 2005 | pmid=15898566 }} </ref><ref>{{cite conference | author = Bouquot J | coauthors = Margolis M; Shankland WE; Imbeau J |title=Through-transmission alveolar sonography (TTAS)&nbsp;– a new technology for evaluation of medullary diseases, correlation with histopathology of 285 scanned jaw sites |booktitle=56th annual meeting of the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology |date=April 2002}}</ref> When practitioners have an up to date understanding of the disease process and a good anamnesis is combined with detailed clinical findings and course of events, the diagnosis, with the help of various imaging modality, can be achieved earlier, in most patients.

In the modern dental profession, it is only recently when severe cases associated with bisphosphonates came to light, that the issue of ONJ has been brought to the attention of a majority of dentists. At present, the focus is mostly on bisphosphonates associated cases, and is sometimes referred to colloquially as "phossy jaw", a similar, earlier occupational disease.<ref name="pmid15850440">{{cite journal | author = Purcell PM | coauthors = Boyd IW |title=Bisphosphonates and osteonecrosis of the jaw |journal=Med. J. Aust. |volume=182 |issue=8 |pages=417–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15850440 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Carreyrou J |title=Fosamax Drug Could Become Next Merck Woe |agency=Dow Jones |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=12 April 2006 }}</ref> However, the pharmaceutical manufacturers of bisphosphonates drugs such as Merck and Novartis have stated that ONJ in patients on this class of drug, can be related to a pre-existing condition, coagulopathy, anemia, infection, use of corticosteroids, alcoholism and other conditions already known to be associated with ONJ in absence of bisphosphonate therapy. The implication is that bisphosphonates may not be the initiating cause of ONJ and that other pre-existing or concurrent systemic and/or local dental factors are involved.<ref>[http://www.merck.com/newsroom/press_releases/product/fosamax_statement.html "Statement by Merck regarding Fosamax and rare cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw"]. Merck. </ref><ref>[http://www.novartisoncology.us/patients-caregivers/coping-cancer/dental-health-osteonecrosis.jsp "Osteonecrosis of the Jaw"]. Novartis.</ref>

Since ONJ has been diagnosed in many patients who did not take bisphosphonates, it is thus logical to assume that bisphosphonates are not the only factor in ONJ. While the oversuppression of bone turnover seems to play a major role in aggravating the disease process, other factors can and do initiate the [[Pathophysiology|pathophysiological]] mechanisms responsible for ONJ. In non-bisphosphonate cases of ONJ, it is mainly the cancellous portion of the bone and it's marrow content that are involved in the disease process. The first stage is an [[oedema]] of the bone marrow initiated by a bone infarct, which is itself modulated by numerous etiological factors, leading to [[myelofibrosis]] as a result of hypoxia and gradual loss of mineral [[bone density]] characteristic of ischaemic osteoporosis. Further deterioration can be triggered by additional bone infarcts leading to anoxia and a localized areas of osteonecrosis within the osteoporotic cancellous bone. Secondary events such as dental infection, injection of [[local anaesthetics]] with [[vasoconstrictor]]s, such as [[epinephrine]], and trauma can add further complications to the disease process and chronic non-pus forming bone infection [[osteomyelitis]] can also be associated with ONJ.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bouquot J | coauthors = Wrobleski G; Fenton S |title=The most common osteonecrosis?

However, in patients on bisphosphonates, the cortical bone is also frequently involved as well. Spontaneous exposure of necrotic bone tissue through the oral soft tissues or following non-healing bone exposure after routine dental surgery, characteristics of this form of ONJ, may be the result of late diagnosis of a disease process that has been masked by the oversuppression of osteoclastic activity, allowing pre-existing [[etiological]] factors to further aggravate bone damage.
