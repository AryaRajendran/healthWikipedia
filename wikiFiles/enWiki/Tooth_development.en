'''Tooth development''' or '''odontogenesis''' is the complex process by which  [[tooth|teeth]] form from [[embryo]]nic [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[cell growth|grow]], and erupt into the [[mouth]]. Although many diverse [[species]] have teeth, non-human tooth development is largely the same as in humans. For [[Tooth (human)|human teeth]] to have a healthy [[oral cavity|oral]] environment, [[tooth enamel|enamel]], [[dentin]], [[cementum]], and the [[periodontium]] must all develop during appropriate stages of [[fetal development]]. [[Deciduous teeth|Primary (baby) teeth]] start to form between the sixth and eighth weeks, and [[permanent teeth]] begin to form in the twentieth week.<ref name="OH1">{{Cite book|author=Ten Cate, A. R. |title=Oral histology: development, structure, and function |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=1998 |pages=81–102 |isbn=0-8151-2952-1}}</ref> If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.

A significant amount of research has focused on determining the processes that initiate tooth development. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within the tissues of the first [[branchial arch]] that is necessary for the development of teeth.<ref name="OH1" />

In vertebrates, several specializations of [[epithelial]] tissue ('phanères') generate after thickening specific structures: [[keratin]]ized structure ([[hair]], [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]]) or exoskeletons structure ([[dermal denticle|scales]], teeth).
[[Dermal denticle|Placoids scales]] and teeth of [[sharks]] are considered homologous organs.<ref name="Luan2005">{{cite journal|last=Luan|first=X.|coauthors=Ito Y., & Diekwisch T.G.

==The developing tooth bud==
[[File:Histology of important stages of tooth development..jpg|thumb|Histology of important stages of tooth development]]
One of the earliest steps in the formation of a tooth that can be seen microscopically is the distinction between the [[vestibular lamina]] and the [[dental lamina]]. The dental lamina connects the developing tooth bud to the [[epithelium|epithelial]] layer of the mouth for a significant time.<ref>University of Southern California School of Dentistry, ''The Bell Stage: Image 26'' found here [http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/ohisto/Cards/tdev/26_bb.html]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}.</ref>

Tooth development is commonly divided into the following stages: the bud stage, the cap stage, the bell stage, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth development is an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth.<ref name="OH1" /> This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.{{Clarify|date=December 2010}}

===Bud stage===
The bud stage is characterized by the appearance of a tooth bud without a clear arrangement of cells. The stage technically begins once epithelial cells proliferate into the [[Mesenchyme#Ectomesenchyme|ectomesenchyme]] of the jaw.<ref name="OH1" />  Typically, this occurs when the fetus is around 6 weeks old.<ref name="Wheaters-255">{{Cite book|author=Barbara Young, Paul R. Wheater |title=Wheaters Functional Histology |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |page=255 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=88tla60sHAUC&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255 |isbn=978-0-443-06850-8 |year=2006}}</ref>  The tooth bud itself is the group of cells at the end of the dental lamina.

Along with the formation of the dental lamina, 10 round epithelial structures, each referred to as a bud, develop at the distal aspect of the dental lamina of each arch. These correspond to the 10 deciduous teeth of each dental arch, and they signify the bud stage of tooth development.
Each bud is separated from the ectomesenchyme by a basement membrane. Ectomesenchymal cells congregate deep to the bud, forming a cluster of cells, which is the initiation of the condensation of the ectomesenchyme. The remaining ectomesenchymal cells are arranged in a more or less haphazardly uniform fashion.

===Cap stage===
[[File:capstage11-23-05.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Histologic slide of tooth in cap stage.]]
The first signs of an arrangement of cells in the tooth bud occur in the cap stage. A small group of ectomesenchymal cells stops producing [[extracellular]] substances, which results in an aggregation of these cells called the dental papilla. At this point, the tooth bud grows around the ectomesenchymal aggregation, taking on the appearance of a cap, and becomes the enamel (or dental) organ. A condensation of ectomesenchymal cells called the dental follicle surrounds the enamel organ and limits the dental papilla. Eventually, the enamel organ will produce enamel, the dental papilla will produce dentin and pulp, and the dental follicle will produce all the supporting structures of a tooth.<ref name="OH1" />

[[File:Earlybellstage11-18-05.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Histologic slide of tooth in early bell stage. Note cell organization.]]

===Bell stage===
The bell stage is known for the histodifferentiation and morphodifferentiation that takes place. The dental organ is bell-shaped during this stage, and the majority of its cells are called stellate reticulum because of their star-shaped appearance.  The bell stage is divided into the ''early bell stage'' and the ''late bell stage''.<ref name="OH1" />  Cells on the periphery of the enamel organ separate into three important layers. Cuboidal cells on the periphery of the dental organ are known as outer enamel epithelium.<ref name = "Longhorns_Medical"/> The columnar cells of the enamel organ adjacent to the dental papilla are known as inner enamel epithelium. The cells between the inner enamel epithelium and the stellate reticulum form a layer known as the stratum intermedium.  The rim of the dental organ where the outer and inner enamel epithelium join is called the ''cervical loop''.<ref>University of Southern California School of Dentistry, ''The Bell Stage: Image 30'' found here [http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/ohisto/Cards/tdev/30_bb.html]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}.</ref> In summary, the layers in order of innermost to outermost consist of dentine, enamel (formed by inner enamel epithelium, or 'ameloblasts', as they move outwards/upwards), inner enamel epithelium and stratum intermedium (specialised stratified cells that support the synthetic activity of the inner enamel epithelium)  What follows is part of the initial 'enamel organ', the middle of which is made up of stellate reticulum cells.  This is all encased by the outer enamel epithelium layer.

Other events occur during the bell stage.  The dental lamina disintegrates, leaving the developing teeth completely separated from the [[epithelium]] of the oral cavity; the two will not join again until the final eruption of the tooth into the mouth.<ref name="OH1" />
[[File:Latebellstage11-18-05.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Histologic slide of tooth in late bell stage. Note disintegration of dental lamina at top.]]
The crown of the tooth, which is influenced by the shape of the internal enamel epithelium, also takes shape during this stage. Throughout the mouth, all teeth undergo this same process; it is still uncertain why teeth form various crown shapes—for instance, incisors versus canines. There are two dominant hypotheses. The "field model" proposes there are components for each type of tooth shape found in the ectomesenchyme during tooth development. The components for particular types of teeth, such as incisors, are localized in one area and dissipate rapidly in different parts of the mouth. Thus, for example, the "incisor field" has factors that develop teeth into incisor shape, and this field is concentrated in the central incisor area, but decreases rapidly in the canine area. The other dominant hypothesis, the "clone model", proposes that the epithelium programs a group of ectomesenchymal cells to generate teeth of particular shapes. This group of cells, called a clone, coaxes the dental lamina into tooth development, causing a tooth bud to form. Growth of the dental lamina continues in an area called the "progress zone". Once the progress zone travels a certain distance from the first tooth bud, a second tooth bud will start to develop. These two models are not necessarily mutually exclusive, nor does widely accepted dental science consider them to be so: it is postulated that both models influence tooth development at different times.<ref name="OH1" />

Other structures that may appear in a developing tooth in this stage are [[enamel knot]]s, [[enamel cord]]s, and [[enamel niche]].<ref name="OH1" />

[[File:Enamelmineralization11-17-05.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Histologic slide of developing hard tissues. Ameloblasts are forming enamel, while odontoblasts are forming dentin.]]

===Crown stage===
Hard tissues, including enamel and dentin, develop during the next stage of tooth development. This stage is called the crown, or maturation, stage by some researchers. Important cellular changes occur at this time. In prior stages, all of the inner enamel epithelium cells were dividing to increase the overall size of the tooth bud, but rapid dividing, called [[mitosis]], stops during the crown stage at the location where the [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusps]] of the teeth form. The first mineralized hard tissues form at this location. At the same time, the inner enamel epithelial cells change in shape from cuboidal to columnar. The [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] of these cells move closer to the stratum intermedium and away from the dental papilla.<ref name="OH1" />

[[File:Crosssectiontooth11-24-05.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Histologic slide of tooth. Note the tubular appearance of dentin.
<br/>A: enamel
<br/>B: dentin]]

The adjacent layer of cells in the dental papilla suddenly increases in size and [[cellular differentiation|differentiates]] into odontoblasts, which are the cells that form dentin.<ref>Ross, Kaye, and Pawlina, ''Histology: a text and atlas'', p. 444.</ref> Researchers believe that the odontoblasts would not form if it were not for the changes occurring in the inner enamel epithelium. As the changes to the inner enamel epithelium and the formation of odontoblasts continue from the tips of the cusps, the odontoblasts secrete a substance, an [[Matrix (biology)|organic matrix]], into their immediate surrounding. The organic matrix contains the material needed for dentin formation.  As odontoblasts deposit organic matrix, they migrate toward the center of the dental papilla. Thus, unlike enamel, dentin starts forming in the surface closest to the outside of the tooth and proceeds inward. Cytoplasmic extensions are left behind as the odontoblasts move inward. The unique, tubular microscopic appearance of dentin is a result of the formation of dentin around these extensions.<ref name="OH1" />

After dentin formation begins, the cells of the inner enamel epithelium secrete an organic matrix against the dentin. This matrix immediately mineralizes and becomes the tooth's enamel. Outside the dentin are ameloblasts, which are cells that continue the process of enamel formation; therefore, enamel formation moves outwards, adding new material to the outer surface of the developing tooth.

==Hard tissue formation==
[[File:Tooth Section.svg|right|300px|thumb|Sections of tooth undergoing development.]]

===Enamel===
{{Main|Amelogenesis}}
Enamel formation is called amelogenesis and occurs in the crown stage of tooth development. "Reciprocal induction" governs the relationship between the formation of dentin and enamel; dentin formation must always occur before enamel formation. Generally, enamel formation occurs in two stages: the secretory and maturation stages.<ref>Cate, ''Oral Histology'', p. 197.</ref> Proteins and an organic matrix form a partially mineralized enamel in the secretory stage; the maturation stage completes enamel mineralization.

In the secretory stage, ameloblasts release enamel proteins that contribute to the enamel matrix, which is then partially mineralized by the enzyme [[alkaline phosphatase]].<ref>Ross, Kaye, and Pawlina, ''Histology: Text and Atlas'', p. 445.</ref> The appearance of this [[mineralized tissues|mineralized tissue]], which occurs usually around the third or fourth month of pregnancy, marks the first appearance of enamel in the body. Ameloblasts deposit enamel at the location of what become cusps of teeth alongside dentin. Enamel formation then continues outward, away from the center of the tooth.

In the maturation stage, the ameloblasts transport some of the substances used in enamel formation out of the enamel. Thus, the function of ameloblasts changes from enamel production, as occurs in the secretory stage, to transportation of substances. Most of the materials transported by ameloblasts in this stage are proteins used to complete mineralization. The important proteins involved are [[amelogenin]]s, [[ameloblastin]]s, [[enamelin]]s, and [[tuftelin]]s.<ref>Ross, Kaye, and Pawlina, ''Histology: Text and Atlas'', p. 447.</ref> By the end of this stage, the enamel has completed its mineralization.

===Dentin===
{{Main|Dentinogenesis}}
Dentin formation, known as dentinogenesis, is the first identifiable feature in the crown stage of tooth development. The formation of dentin must always occur before the formation of enamel. The different stages of dentin formation result in different types of dentin: mantle dentin, primary dentin, secondary dentin, and tertiary dentin.

Odontoblasts, the dentin-forming cells, differentiate from cells of the dental papilla. They begin secreting an organic matrix around the area directly adjacent to the inner enamel epithelium, closest to the area of the future cusp of a tooth. The organic matrix contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1–0.2&nbsp;μm in diameter).<ref name="OH3">Cate, ''Oral Histology'', p. 128-139.</ref> The odontoblasts begin to move toward the center of the tooth, forming an extension called the [[odontoblast process]].<ref name="OH1" /> Thus, dentin formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix. This area of mineralization is known as mantle dentin and is a layer usually about 150&nbsp;μm thick.<ref name="OH3" />

Whereas mantle dentin forms from the preexisting ground substance of the dental papilla, primary dentin forms through a different process. Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating the availability of any extracellular resources to contribute to an organic matrix for mineralization. Additionally, the larger odontoblasts cause [[collagen]] to be secreted in smaller amounts, which results in more tightly arranged, heterogeneous nucleation that is used for mineralization. Other materials (such as [[lipid]]s, [[phosphoprotein]]s, and [[phospholipid]]s) are also secreted.<ref name="OH3" />

Secondary dentin is formed after root formation is finished and occurs at a much slower rate. It is not formed at a uniform rate along the tooth, but instead forms faster along sections closer to the crown of a tooth.<ref>Summitt, ''Fundamentals of Operative Dentistry'', p. 13.</ref> This development continues throughout life and accounts for the smaller areas of pulp found in older individuals.<ref name="OH3" /> Tertiary dentin, also known as reparative dentin, forms in reaction to stimuli, such as [[Attrition (dental)|attrition]] or [[dental caries]].<ref>Summitt, ''Fundamentals of Operative Dentistry'', p. 183.</ref>

[[File:Crosssectionroottooth11-24-05.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Cross-section of tooth at root. Note clear, acellular appearance of cementum.<br/>A: dentin<br/>B: cementum]]

===Cementum===
[[Cementum]] formation is called [[cementogenesis]] and occurs late in the development of teeth.  [[Cementoblasts]] are the cells responsible for cementogenesis. Two types of cementum form: cellular and acellular.<ref>Johnson, ''Biology of the Human Dentition'', p. 183.</ref>

Acellular cementum forms first. The cementoblasts differentiate from follicular cells, which can only reach the surface of the tooth's root once [[Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath]] (HERS) has begun to deteriorate. The cementoblasts secrete fine collagen fibrils along the root surface at right angles before migrating away from the tooth. As the cementoblasts move, more collagen is deposited to lengthen and thicken the bundles of fibers. Noncollagenous proteins, such as [[bone sialoprotein]] and [[osteocalcin]], are also secreted.<ref name="OH2">Cate, ''Oral Histology'', p. 236-248.</ref> Acellular cementum contains a secreted matrix of proteins and fibers. As mineralization takes place, the cementoblasts move away from the cementum, and the fibers left along the surface eventually join the forming periodontal ligaments.

Cellular cementum develops after most of the tooth formation is complete and after the tooth occludes (in contact) with a tooth in the opposite arch.<ref name="OH2" /> This type of cementum forms around the fiber bundles of the periodontal ligaments. The cementoblasts forming cellular cementum become trapped in the cementum they produce.

The origin of the formative cementoblasts is believed to be different for cellular cementum and acellular cementum. One of the major current hypotheses is that cells producing cellular cementum migrate from the adjacent area of bone, while cells producing acellular cementum arise from the dental follicle.<ref name="OH2" />  Nonetheless, it is known that cellular cementum is usually not found in teeth with one root.<ref name="OH2" />  In [[premolar]]s and [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s, cellular cementum is found only in the part of the root closest to the apex and in interradicular areas between multiple roots.

<br/>D: periodontal ligaments]]

==Formation of the periodontium==
The periodontium, which is the supporting structure of a tooth, consists of the cementum, periodontal ligaments, [[gingiva]], and [[alveolar bone]]. Cementum is the only one of these that is a part of a tooth. Alveolar bone surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called a "[[Dental alveolus|socket]]". Periodontal ligaments connect the alveolar bone to the cementum, and the gingiva is the surrounding tissue visible in the mouth.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Luan X, Ito Y, Diekwisch TG |title=Evolution and Development of Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath |journal=Developmental Dynamics |volume=235 |issue=5 |pages=1167–80 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16450392 |pmc=2734338 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.20674}}</ref>

===Periodontal ligament===
Cells from the dental follicle give rise to the [[periodontal ligament]] (PDL). Specific events leading to the formation of the periodontal ligament vary between deciduous (baby) and permanent teeth and among various [[species]] of animals.<ref name="OH2" /> Nonetheless, formation of the periodontal ligament begins with ligament fibroblasts from the dental follicle. These fibroblasts secrete collagen, which interacts with fibers on the surfaces of adjacent bone and cementum.<ref name="Ross, Kaye p. 453">Ross, Kaye, and Pawlina, ''Histology: Text and Atlas'', p. 453.</ref> This interaction leads to an attachment that develops as the tooth erupts into the mouth. The [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]], which is the arrangement of teeth and how teeth in opposite arches come in contact with one another, continually affects the formation of periodontal ligament. This perpetual creation of periodontal ligament leads to the formation of groups of fibers in different orientations, such as horizontal and oblique fibers.<ref name="OH2" />

===Alveolar bone===
As root and cementum formation begin, bone is created in the adjacent area. Throughout the body, cells that form bone are called [[osteoblast]]s. In the case of alveolar bone, these osteoblast cells form from the dental follicle.<ref name="OH2" /> Similar to the formation of primary cementum, collagen fibers are created on the surface nearest the tooth, and they remain there until attaching to periodontal ligaments.

Like any other bone in the human body, alveolar bone is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and [[osteoclast]]s destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth.<ref name="Ross, Kaye p. 452">Ross, Kaye, and Pawlina, ''Histology: Text and Atlas'', p. 452.</ref> As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under [[compression (physical)|compressive]] [[force]] from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in [[bone resorption]]. An area of bone receiving [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has a high number of osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Gingiva===
The connection between the gingiva and the tooth is called the dentogingival junction. This junction has three epithelial types: gingival, sulcular, and junctional epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth.<ref name="OH2" />

Much about gingival formation is not fully understood, but it is known that [[hemidesmosomes]] form between the gingival epithelium and the tooth and are responsible for the ''primary epithelial attachment''.<ref name="OH2" /> Hemidesmosomes provide anchorage between cells through small filament-like structures provided by the remnants of ameloblasts.  Once this occurs, junctional epithelium forms from reduced enamel epithelium, one of the products of the enamel organ, and divides rapidly. This results in the perpetually increasing size of the junctional epithelial layer and the isolation of the remnants of ameloblasts from any source of nutrition. As the ameloblasts degenerate, a [[gingival sulcus]] is created.

==Nerve and vascular formation==
Frequently, nerves and blood vessels run parallel to each other in the body, and the formation of both usually takes place simultaneously and in a similar fashion. However, this is not the case for nerves and blood vessels around the tooth, because of different rates of development.<ref name="OH1" />

===Nerve formation===
[[Nerve fiber]]s start to near the tooth during the cap stage of tooth development and grow toward the dental follicle. Once there, the nerves develop around the tooth bud and enter the dental papilla when dentin formation has begun. Nerves never proliferate into the enamel organ.<<ref name="OH1" />

===Vascular formation===
[[Blood vessel]]s grow in the dental follicle and enter the [[dental papilla]] in the cap stage.<ref name="OH1" /> Groups of blood vessels form at the entrance of the dental papilla. The number of blood vessels reaches a maximum at the beginning of the crown stage, and the dental papilla eventually forms in the pulp of a tooth. Throughout life, the amount of pulpal tissue in a tooth decreases, which means that the blood supply to the tooth decreases with age.<ref name="Ross, Kaye p. 452"/> The enamel organ is devoid of blood vessels because of its epithelial origin, and the [[mineralized tissues]] of enamel and dentin do not need nutrients from the blood.

==Tooth eruption==
{{Main|Tooth eruption}}

Tooth eruption occurs when the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Although researchers agree that tooth eruption is a complex process, there is little agreement on the identity of the mechanism that controls eruption.<ref>Riolo and Avery, ''Essentials for Orthodontic Practice'', p. 142.</ref> Some commonly held theories that have been disproven over time include: (1) the tooth is pushed upward into the mouth by the growth of the tooth's root, (2) the tooth is pushed upward by the growth of the bone around the tooth, (3) the tooth is pushed upward by vascular pressure, and (4) the tooth is pushed upward by the cushioned hammock.<ref>Harris, ''Craniofacial Growth and Development'', pp. 1–3.</ref> The cushioned hammock theory, first proposed by Harry Sicher, was taught widely from the 1930s to the 1950s. This theory postulated that a [[ligament]] below a tooth, which Sicher observed under a microscope on a histologic slide, was responsible for eruption. Later, the "ligament" Sicher observed was determined to be merely an [[Artifact (observational)|artifact]] created in the process of preparing the slide.<ref>Harris, ''Craniofacial Growth and Development'', p. 3.</ref>

The most widely held current theory is that while several forces might be involved in eruption, the periodontal ligaments provide the main impetus for the process. Theorists hypothesize that the periodontal ligaments promote eruption through the shrinking and cross-linking of their collagen fibers and the contraction of their fibroblasts.<ref>Harris, ''Craniofacial Growth and Development'', p. 5.</ref>

Although tooth eruption occurs at different times for different people, a general eruption timeline exists. Typically, humans have 20 [[Deciduous teeth|primary (baby) teeth]] and 32 [[permanent teeth]].<ref>The American Dental Association, ''Tooth Eruption Charts'' found here [http://www.ada.org/public/topics/tooth_eruption.asp]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}.</ref> Tooth eruption has three stages. The first, known as deciduous [[dentition]] stage, occurs when only primary teeth are visible. Once the first permanent tooth erupts into the mouth, the teeth are in the mixed (or transitional) dentition. After the last primary tooth falls out of the mouth—a process known as exfoliation—the teeth are in the permanent dentition.

Primary dentition starts on the arrival of the [[mandibular central incisor]]s, usually at eight months, and lasts until the first permanent molars appear in the mouth, usually at six years.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Major M. |last1=Ash |first2=Stanley J. |last2=Nelson |title=Wheeler's dental anatomy, physiology, and occlusion |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |pages=38 and 41 |isbn=978-0-7216-9382-8}}</ref> The primary teeth typically erupt in the following order: (1) central [[incisor]], (2) lateral incisor, (3) first [[Molar (tooth)|molar]], (4) [[Canine tooth|canine]], and (5) second molar.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Major M. |last1=Ash |first2=Stanley J. |last2=Nelson |title=Wheeler's dental anatomy, physiology, and occlusion |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |page=38 |isbn=978-0-7216-9382-8}}</ref> As a general rule, four teeth erupt for every six months of life, mandibular teeth erupt before maxillary teeth, and teeth erupt sooner in females than males.<ref>WebMd, ''Dental Health: Your Child's Teeth'' found here [http://www.webmd.com/content/article/66/79639.htm?z=4208_00000_9003_to_02].</ref> During primary dentition, the tooth buds of permanent teeth develop below the primary teeth, close to the palate or tongue.

Mixed dentition starts when the first permanent molar appears in the mouth, usually at six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at eleven or twelve years.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Major M. |last1=Ash |first2=Stanley J. |last2=Nelson |title=Wheeler's dental anatomy, physiology, and occlusion |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |page=41 |isbn=978-0-7216-9382-8}}</ref> Permanent teeth in the maxilla erupt in a different order from permanent teeth on the mandible. Maxillary teeth erupt in the following order: (1) [[Maxillary first molar|first molar]] (2) [[Maxillary central incisor|central incisor]], (3) [[Maxillary lateral incisor|lateral incisor]], (4) [[Maxillary first premolar|first premolar]], (5) [[Maxillary second premolar|second premolar]], (6) [[Maxillary canine|canine]], (7) [[Maxillary second molar|second molar]], and (8) [[Maxillary third molar|third molar]]. Mandibular teeth erupt in the following order: (1) [[Mandibular first molar|first molar]] (2) [[Mandibular central incisor|central incisor]], (3) [[Mandibular lateral incisor|lateral incisor]], (4) [[Mandibular canine|canine]], (5) [[Mandibular first premolar|first premolar]], (6) [[Mandibular second premolar|second premolar]], (7) [[Mandibular second molar|second molar]], and (8) [[Mandibular third molar|third molar]]. Since there are no premolars in the primary dentition, the primary molars are replaced by permanent premolars.<ref>Monthly Microscopy Explorations, ''Exploration of the Month: January 1998 ''.</ref> If any primary teeth are lost before permanent teeth are ready to replace them, some posterior teeth may drift forward and cause space to be lost in the mouth.<ref>Health Hawaii, ''Primary Teeth: Importance and Care '' found here [http://www.healthhawaii.org/dental/primary.html].</ref> This may cause crowding and/or misplacement once the permanent teeth erupt, which is usually referred to as [[malocclusion]]. [[Orthodontics]] may be required in such circumstances for an individual to achieve a straight set of teeth.

The permanent dentition begins when the last primary tooth is lost, usually at 11 to 12 years, and lasts for the rest of a person's life or until all of the teeth are lost ([[edentulism]]). During this stage, third molars (also called "[[wisdom teeth]]") are frequently [[Extraction (dental)|extracted]] because of decay, pain or impactions. The main reasons for [[tooth loss]] are [[dental caries|decay]] and [[periodontal disease]].<ref>American Academy of Periodontology, ''Oral Health Information for the Public '' found here [http://www.perio.org/consumer/media/media-faq.htm]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}.</ref>

Immediately after the eruption enamel is covered by a specific film: [[James Nasmyth|Nasmyth's membrane]] or 'enamel cuticle', structure of embryological origin is composed of [[keratin]] which gives rise to the [[enamel organ]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Armstrong WG |title=Origin and nature of the acquired pellicle |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=61 |issue=9 |pages=923–30 |year=1968 |month=September |pmid=5679017 |pmc=1902619}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Darling AI |title=The Distribution of the Enamel Cuticle and Its Significance |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=499–502 |year=1943 |month=July |pmid=19992694 |pmc=1998608}}</ref>

==Nutrition and tooth development==
As in other aspects of human growth and development, nutrition has an effect on the developing tooth. Essential nutrients for a healthy tooth include [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], and [[vitamin]]s [[retinol|A]], [[Vitamin C|C]], and [[Vitamin D|D]].<ref>The American Dental Hygiene Association, ''Nutritional Factors in Tooth Development'' found here [http://www.adha.org/CE_courses/course7/nutritional_factors.htm].</ref> Calcium and phosphorus are needed to properly form the hydroxyapatite crystals, and their levels in the blood are maintained by Vitamin D. Vitamin A is necessary for the formation of [[keratin]], as Vitamin C is for collagen. Fluoride is incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal of a developing tooth and makes it more resistant to demineralization and subsequent decay.<ref name="Ross, Kaye p. 453"/>

Deficiencies of these nutrients can have a wide range of effects on tooth development.<ref>The American Dental Hygiene Association, ''Table II. Effects of nutrient deficiencies on tooth development'' found here [http://www.adha.org/CE_courses/course7/table2.htm].</ref> In situations where calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D are deficient, the hard structures of a tooth may be less mineralized. A lack of vitamin A can cause a reduction in the amount of enamel formation. Fluoride deficiency causes increased demineralization when the tooth is exposed to an acidic environment, and also delays [[Remineralisation of teeth|remineralization]]<!--Check my change of the wording-->. Furthermore, an excess of fluoride while a tooth is in development can lead to a condition known as [[Dental fluorosis|fluorosis]].

Celiac disease can cause dental enamel defects in children.<ref>http://celiac.nih.gov/PDF/Dental_Enamel_Defects_508.pdf</ref>

==Abnormalities==
There are a number of tooth abnormalities relating to development.

Anodontia is a complete lack of tooth development, and [[hypodontia]] is a lack of some tooth development. Anodontia is rare, most often occurring in a condition called [[Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia]], while hypodontia is one of the most common developmental abnormalities, affecting 3.5&ndash;8.0% of the population (not including third molars). The absence of [[third molar]]s is very common, occurring in 20&ndash;23% of the population, followed in prevalence by the [[second premolar]] and [[lateral incisor]]. Hypodontia is often associated with the absence of a dental lamina, which is vulnerable to environmental forces, such as infection and [[chemotherapy]] medications, and is also associated with many syndromes, such as [[Down syndrome]] and [[Crouzon syndrome]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Orthodontics and Paediatric Dentistry |last=Millett |first=Declan T. |coauthors=Richard Welbury |year=2000 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=0-443-06287-0 }}</ref>

[[Hyperdontia]] is the development of extraneous teeth. It occurs in 1&ndash;3% of [[White (people)|Caucasians]] and is more frequent in [[Asian people|Asian]]s.<ref>Neville, Damm, Allen, and Bouquot, ''Oral & Maxillofacial Pathology'', p. 70.</ref> About 86% of these cases involve a single extra tooth in the mouth, most commonly found in the maxilla, where the [[incisor]]s are located.<ref>Kahn, ''Basic Oral & Maxillofacial Pathology'', p. 49.</ref> Hyperdontia is believed to be associated with an excess of dental lamina.

Dilaceration is an abnormal bend found on a tooth, and is nearly always associated with trauma that moves the developing tooth bud. As a tooth is forming, a force can move the tooth from its original position, leaving the rest of the tooth to form at an abnormal angle. [[Cyst]]s or [[tumor]]s adjacent to a tooth bud are forces known to cause dilaceration, as are primary (baby) teeth pushed upward by trauma into the gingiva where it moves the tooth bud of the permanent tooth.<ref>Neville, Damm, Allen, and Bouquot, ''Oral & Maxillofacial Pathology'', p. 86.</ref>

[[Regional odontodysplasia]] is rare, but is most likely to occur in the maxilla and anterior teeth. The cause is unknown; a number of causes have been postulated, including a disturbance in the neural crest cells, infection, radiation therapy, and a decrease in vascular supply (the most widely held hypothesis).<ref>Neville, Damm, Allen, and Bouquot, ''Oral & Maxillofacial Pathology'', p. 99.</ref> Teeth affected by regional odontodysplasia never erupt into the mouth, have small crowns, are yellow-brown, and have irregular shapes. The appearance of these teeth in radiographs is translucent and "wispy," resulting in the nickname "ghost teeth".<ref>Kahn, ''Basic Oral & Maxillofacial Pathology'', p. 58.</ref>

True teeth are unique to [[vertebrates]],<ref name="kardong">{{cite book|last=Kardong|first=Kenneth V.|title=Vertebrates: comparative anatomy, function, evolution|year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-697-21991-7|pages=55, 57}}</ref> although some invertebrates have structures have [[Analogy (biology)|analogous structures]] sometimes called "teeth" - the [[organism]] with the simplest [[genome]] bearing such "[[teeth]]" is probably the [[worm]] genus [[Ancylostoma]] ([[Ancylostoma duodenale]], [[Necator americanus]]).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nematode.net/Species.Summaries/Ancylostoma.duodenale/index.php|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080516010133/http://www.nematode.net/Species.Summaries/Ancylostoma.duodenale/index.php|archivedate = 2008-05-16|title = Ancylostoma duodenale|publisher = Nematode.net Genome Sequencing Center |accessdate = 2009-10-27}}</ref> Molluscs have a structure called a [[radula]] which bears a ribbon of [[chitin]]ous "teeth". However, these are histologically and developmentally different from vertebrate teeth, and are unlikely to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]]. For example, vertebrate teeth develop from a [[neural crest]] mesenchyme-derived [[dental papilla]], and the neural crest is specific to vertebrates, as are tissues such as [[Tooth enamel|enamel]].<ref name="kardong"/>

[[Fish]] have many specialized bony structures,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ezo.wur.nl/UK/MSc+projects/Skeletal+tissue+differentiation+in+fish/ | title = Skeletal tissue differentiation in fish | accessdate = 2009-10-24 | publisher =  Wageninger University | author = Sander Kranenbarg}}</ref> it exist with ([[Archosargus probatocephalus]] order Perciformes, family Sparidae) and without teeth ([[Manefish|Caristiidae]] order Perciformes, family Caristiidae, teeth in traces present in juveniles).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=SAYAAAAAQAAJ |title=The principal forms of the skeleton and the teeth as the basis for a system of natural history and comparativa anatomy |publisher=Houlston and Wright |year=1859 |first=Richard |last=Owen |accessdate=24 October 2009}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

Unlike most animals, [[shark]]s continuously produce new teeth throughout life<ref>Dave Abbott, ''Sharks'', found here [http://www.ms-starship.com/sciencenew/sharks.htm].</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/00220345700490031501 |author=Boyne PJ |title=Study of the chronologic development and eruption of teeth in elasmobranchs |journal=Journal of Dental Research |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=556–60 |year=1970 |pmid=5269110 |url=http://jdr.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=5269110}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Sasagawa I |title=The fine structure of initial mineralisation during tooth development in the gummy shark, Mustelus manazo, Elasmobranchia |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=164 |issue= |pages=175–87 |year=1989 |month=June |pmid=2606790 |pmc=1256608}}</ref> via a drastically different mechanism. Because shark teeth have no roots, sharks easily lose teeth when they feed (zoologists estimate that a single shark can lose up to 2,400 teeth in one year<ref>Jason Buchheim, ''A Quick Course in Ichthyology'', found here [http://www.marinebiology.org/fish.htm].</ref>)—they must therefore be continually replaced. Shark teeth form from modified [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s near the tongue and move outward on the jaw in rows until they fully develop, are used, and are eventually dislodged.<ref>Michael E. Williams, ''Jaws: The early years'', found here [http://www.cmnh.org/collections/vertpaleo/jaws/jaws.html].</ref>

[[Snake]]s generally have teeth, with some exception ([[Dasypeltis|African Egg-eating Snake]]).

Today, [[birds]] do not have [[teeth]], though it is speculated that prehistoric birds, such as [[archaeopteryx]], did.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Sire JY, Delgado SC, Girondot M |title=Hen's teeth with enamel cap: from dream to impossibility |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=8 |issue= |page=246 |year=2008 |pmid=18775069 |pmc=2542379 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-8-246}}</ref>

In [[order (biology)|order]] [[Tubulidentata]] ([[class (biology)|Class]] [[Mammalia]]) teeth are without enamel, they lack incisors and canines and the molars molars are growing continuously from the root.<ref>"[http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/resources/anatomical_images/family_pages/tubulidentata/tubulidentata.jpg/view.html Class Mammalia, Order Tubulidentata, Family Orycteropodidae, Species Orycteropus afer]," University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. Page accessed November 16, 2009.</ref>

Generally, tooth development in non-human [[mammal]]s is similar to human tooth development. The variations lie in the morphology, [[Dentition#Dental_formula|number]], development timeline, and types of teeth, not usually in the actual development of the teeth.

Enamel formation in non-human mammals is almost identical to that in humans. The ameloblasts and enamel organ, including the dental papilla, function similarly.<ref>Frandson and Spurgeon, ''Anatomy and Physiology of Farm Animals.'', p. 305.</ref> Nonetheless, while ameloblasts die in humans and most other animals—making further enamel formation impossible—[[rodent]]s continually produce enamel, forcing them to wear down their teeth by gnawing on various materials.<ref>Caceci.  ''Veterinary Histology'' with subtitle "Digestive System: Oral Cavity" found here [http://education.vetmed.vt.edu/Curriculum/VM8054/Labs/Lab17/Lab17.htm].</ref> If rodents are prevented from gnawing, their teeth eventually puncture the roofs of their mouths. In addition, rodent incisors consist of two halves, known as the crown and root analogues. The labial half is covered with enamel and resembles a crown, while the lingual half is covered with dentin and resembles a root. Both root and crown develop simultaneously in the rodent incisor and continue to grow for the life of the rodent.

The mineral distribution in [[rodent]] enamel is different from that of [[monkey]]s, [[dog]]s, [[pig]]s, and humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/002203457905800224011 |author=Fejerskov O |title=Human dentition and experimental animals |journal=Journal of Dental Research |volume=58 |issue=Spec Issue B |pages=725–34 |year=1979 |month=March |pmid=105027 |url=http://jdr.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=105027}}</ref> In [[horse teeth]], the enamel and dentin layers are intertwined, which increases the strength and decreases the wear rate of the teeth.<ref>Randall-Bowman's April 2004 "Gummed Out: Young Horses Lose Many Teeth, Vet Says."  See reference here [http://vpr.tamu.edu/remarkable/sciencenews.html]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}.</ref><ref>Encarta, whose link can be found here [http://encarta.msn.com/text_761561931__1/Teeth.html]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>

Supporting structures that create a "socket" are found exclusively in [[Mammal]]ia and [[Crocodylia]].<ref name="OH2" /> In [[manatee]]s, mandibular molars develop separately from the jaw, and are encased in a bony shell separated by soft tissue. This also occurs in [[elephant]]s' successional teeth, which erupt to replace lost teeth.
