'''Potassium iodide''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] [[potassium|K]][[iodide|I]]. This white salt is the most commercially significant iodide compound, with approximately 37,000 tons produced in 1985. It is less [[hygroscopic]] (absorbs water less readily) than [[sodium iodide]], making it easier to work with. Aged and impure samples are yellow because of aerial [[oxidation]] of the [[iodide]] to elemental [[iodine]].<ref name=Ullmann>{{Ullmann's | author = Phyllis A. Lyday | title = Iodine and Iodine Compounds | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a14_381}}</ref>
: 4 KI + 2 CO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 2 I<sub>2</sub>

Potassium iodide is medicinally supplied in 130 [[Milligram#SI multiples|mg]] tablets (each containing 100&nbsp;mg iodine as iodide) for emergency purposes related to blockade of radioiodine uptake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://preparedness.com/potioddosgui.html |title=Potassium Iodide Dosage Guidelines & Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Preparedness.com |date=2001-12-10 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> Potassium iodide may also be administered pharmaceutically for [[thyroid storm]] or as an [[expectorant]], as a "saturated solution of potassium iodide" ('''SSKI''') which in the [[U.S.P.]] generic formulation contains 1000&nbsp;mg of KI per mL of solution. This represents 333&nbsp;mg KI and about 250&nbsp;mg iodide (I <sup>-</sup>) in a typical adult dose of 5 drops, assumed to be ⅓ mL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mmx/sski.html |title=SSKI Drug Information, Professional |publisher=Drugs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> Because SSKI is a viscous liquid, it is normally assumed to contain 15 drops/milliliter, not 20 drops/milliliter as is often assumed for water.<ref>[http://wiki.answers.com/Q/20_drops_per_ml_or_15_drops_per_ml Viscous liquids have about 15 drops per mL, not 20]{{self-published inline|date=May 2012}}</ref> Thus, each drop of U.S.P. SSKI is assumed to contain about 50&nbsp;mg iodine as iodide, I <sup>-</sup>. Thus, two (2) drops of U.S.P. SSKI solution is equivalent to one 130&nbsp;mg KI tablet (100&nbsp;mg iodide).

SSKI can also be prepared by truly saturating water with KI. This preparation can be made without a measuring scale. Since the solubility of KI in water at room temperature is about 1.40 to 1.48&nbsp;grams per mL pure water, and the resulting solution has a density of about 1.72 g/mL, this process also results in a final [[mass concentration (chemistry)|concentration]] of KI of about 1000&nbsp;mg KI per mL of saturated KI solution, and also contains essentially the same concentration of iodide per drop as does the U.S.P. formulation.
Due to its high potassium content, SSKI is extremely bitter, and if possible it is administered in a sugar cube or small ball of bread. It may also be mixed into much larger volumes of juices.

Neither SSKI or KI tablets are used as nutritional supplements, since the nutritional requirement for iodine is only 150 micrograms or 0.15&nbsp;mg of iodide per day. Thus, a drop of SSKI provides 50/0.15 = 333 times the daily iodine requirement, and a standard KI tablet provides twice this much.

[[Kelp]] is a natural KI source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100328113340/http://www.florahealth.com/flora/home/Canada/HealthInformation/Encyclopedias/Kelp.htm |title=Kelp, Herb Monograph - Flora Health Herb Encyclopedia |publisher=Florahealth.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-21}}</ref>  The iodide content can range from 89 [[Microgram|µg]]/g to 8165&nbsp;µg/g in Asian varieties, making prepared foods content difficult to estimate.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/thy.2004.14.836 |title=Variability of Iodine Content in Common Commercially Available Edible Seaweeds |year=2004 |last1=Teas |first1=Jane |last2=Pino |first2=Sam |last3=Critchley |first3=Alan |last4=Braverman |first4=Lewis E. |journal=Thyroid |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=836–41 |pmid=15588380}}</ref> Eating 3-5&nbsp;grams of most dried, unrinsed seaweeds will provide the 100-150 micrograms iodide recommended daily allowance for nutritional purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ryandrum.com/seaweeds.htm |title=Medicinal Uses of Seaweeds |publisher=Ryandrum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>

==Structure, production, properties==
Potassium iodide is [[ion]]ic, K<sup>+</sup>I<sup>−</sup>. It crystallises in the [[sodium chloride]] structure. It is produced industrially by treating KOH with iodine.<ref name=Ullmann/>

===Inorganic chemistry===
Since the [[iodide]] ion is a mild [[Redox|reducing agent]], I <sup>−</sup> is easily oxidised to [[iodine|I<sub>2</sub>]] by powerful [[redox|oxidising agents]] such as [[chlorine]]:
:2 KI([[aqueous|aq]])  +  Cl<sub>2</sub>(aq)  →  2 [[Potassium chloride|KCl]]  +  I<sub>2</sub>(aq)
This reaction is employed in the isolation of iodine from natural sources. Air will oxidize iodide, as evidenced by the observation of a purple extract when aged samples of KI are rinsed with [[dichloromethane]]. As formed under acidic conditions, [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI) is a stronger reducing agent.<ref>N. N. Greenwood, A. Earnshaw, ''Chemistry of the Elements'', Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK, 1984{{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref><ref>''Handbook of Chemistry and Physics'', 71st edition, CRC Press, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1990</ref><ref>''The Merck Index'', 7th edition, Merck & Co., Rahway, New Jersey, 1960{{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>

Like other iodide salts, KI forms [[triiodide|I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>]] when combined with elemental [[iodine]].
:KI(aq)  +  [[Iodine|I<sub>2</sub>]]([[solid|s]])  →  KI<sub>3</sub>(aq)
Unlike I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> salts can be highly water-soluble. Through this reaction, [[iodine]] is used in [[redox]] [[titration]]s. Aqueous KI<sub>3</sub>, "[[Lugol's solution]]," are used as disinfectants and as etchants for gold surfaces.

Potassium iodide is the precursor to [[silver(I) iodide]], which is used for high speed [[photographic film]]:
:KI(aq)  +  [[Silver nitrate|AgNO<sub>3</sub>]](aq)  →  AgI(s)  +  [[Potassium nitrate|KNO<sub>3</sub>]](aq)

===Organic chemistry===
KI serves as a source of iodide in [[organic synthesis]]. A useful application is in the preparation of aryl iodides from [[arenediazonium salts]].<ref>L. G. Wade, ''Organic Chemistry'', 5th ed., pp. 871-2, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle RIver, New Jersey, 2003.</ref><ref>J. March, ''Advanced Organic Chemistry'', 4th ed., pp. 670-1, Wiley, New York, 1992.</ref> For example:

[[Image:KI Sandmeyer.png|400px]]

KI, acting as a source of iodide, may also act as a [[nucleophilic catalyst]] for the alkylation of alkyl [[chloride]]s, [[bromide]]s, or [[mesylate]]s.

==Applications==
===Industry===
KI is a precursor to [[silver iodide]] (AgI) an important chemical in film photography. KI is a component in some disinfectants and hair treatment chemicals. KI is also used as a [[fluorescence quenching]] agent in biomedical research, an application that takes advantage of collisional quenching of fluorescent substances by the iodide ion. However, for several fluorophores addition of KI in µM-mM concentrations results in increase of fluorescence intensity, and iodide acts as fluorescence enhancer.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Andriy |last1=Chmyrov |first2=Tor |last2=Sandén |first3=Jerker |last3=Widengren |year=2010 |title=Iodide as a Fluorescence Quencher and Promoter—Mechanisms and Possible Implications |journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B |volume=114 |issue=34 |pages=11282–91 |pmid=20695476 |doi=10.1021/jp103837f}}</ref>

Potassium iodide is a component in the electrolyte of [[dye sensitized solar cell]]s (DSSC) along with iodine.

Potassium iodine finds its most important applications in organic synthesis mainly in the preparation of aryl iodides in the [[Sandmeyer reaction]], starting from aryl amines. Aryl iodides are in turn used to attach aryl groups to other organics by nucleophilic substitution, with iodide ion as the leaving group.

===Nutrition===
The major uses of KI include use as a nutritional supplement in animal feeds and also the human diet. For the latter, it is the most common additive used to "iodize" [[sodium chloride|table salt]] (a public health measure to prevent [[iodine deficiency]] in populations which get little seafood). The oxidation of iodide causes slow loss of iodine content from [[iodised salt]]s that are exposed to excess air. The alkali metal iodide salt, over time and exposure to excess oxygen and carbon dioxide, slowly oxidizes to metal carbonate and elemental iodine, which then evaporates.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Katarzyna |last1=Waszkowiak |first2=Krystyna |last2=Szymandera-Buszka |title=Effect of storage conditions on potassium iodide stability in iodised table salt and collagen preparations |journal=International Journal of Food Science & Technology |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=895–9 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01538.x |year=2008}}</ref> [[Potassium iodate]] is used to add iodine to some salts so that the iodine is not lost by oxidation.

For reasons noted above, therapeutic drops of SSKI, or 130&nbsp;mg tablets of KI as used for nuclear fission accidents, are not used as nutritional supplements, since an SSKI drop or nuclear-emergency tablet provides 300 to 700 times more iodine than the daily adult nutritional requirement. Dedicated nutritional iodide tablets containing 0.15&nbsp;mg (150 microgram or mcg) of iodide, from KI or from various other sources (such as kelp extract) are marketed as supplements, but they are not to be confused with the much higher pharmaceutical dose preparations.

===Pharmaceutical applications===
Potassium iodide can be conveniently prepared as a saturated solution, abbreviated SSKI. This method of delivering potassium iodide does not require a method to weigh out the potassium iodide so it can be used in an emergency situation. KI crystals are simply added to water until no more KI will dissolve and instead sits at the bottom of the container. With pure water, the concentration of KI in the solution depends only on the temperature. Potassium iodide is highly soluble in water so SSKI is a concentrated source of KI. At 20 degrees Celsius the solubility of KI is 140-148&nbsp;grams per 100&nbsp;grams of water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/p5906.htm |title=Solubility of KI in water |publisher=Hazard.com |date=1998-04-21 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref> Because the volumes of KI and water are approximately additive, the resulting SSKI solution will contain about 1.40&nbsp;gram (1400&nbsp;mg) KI per milliliter (mL) of solution. This is 100% weight/volume (note units of [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]]) of KI (one gram KI per mL solution), which is possible because SSKI is significantly more dense than pure water—about 1.72 g/mL.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01916122.1993.9989424 |jstor=3687792 |title=Pollen purification and fractionation by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation |year=1993 |last1=Forster |first1=Mark |last2=Flenley |first2=John R. |journal=Palynology |volume=17 |pages=137–55}}</ref> Because KI is about 76.4% iodide by weight, SSKI contains about 764&nbsp;mg iodide per mL. This [[mass concentration (chemistry)|concentration]] of iodide allows the calculation of the iodide dose per drop, if one knows the number of drops per milliliter. For SSKI, a solution more viscous than water, there are assumed to be 15 drops per mL; the iodide dose is therefore approximately 51&nbsp;mg per drop, assuming 15 drops/mL. It is conventionally rounded to 50&nbsp;mg per drop.

The term SSKI is also used, especially by pharmacists, to refer to a U.S.P. pre-prepared solution formula, made by adding exactly KI to water to prepare a solution containing of 1000&nbsp;mg KI per mL solution (100% wt/volume KI solution), to closely approximate the concentration of SSKI made by saturation. This is essentially interchangeable with SSKI made by saturation, and also contains about 50&nbsp;mg iodide per drop.

*Saturated solutions of potassium iodide can be an emergency treatment for [[hyperthyroidism]] (so-called [[thyroid storm]]), as high amounts of iodide temporarily suppress secretion of thyroxine from the thyroid gland.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-iodine.html "Iodine."]  ''MedlinePlus''.</ref>  The dose typically begins with a loading dose, then 1/3 mL SSKI (5 drops or 250&nbsp;mg iodine as iodide), three times per day.

*Iodide solutions made from a few drops of SSKI added to drinks have also been used as [[expectorant]]s to increase the water content of respiratory secretions and encourage effective coughing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

*SSKI has been proposed as a [[topical]] treatment for [[sporotrichosis]], but no trials have been conducted to determine the efficacy or side effects of such treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006136.pub2 |title=Oral potassium iodide for the treatment of sporotrichosis |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2009 |last1=Xue |first1=Siliang |last2=Gu |first2=Rui |last3=Wu |first3=Taixiang |last4=Zhang |first4=Mingming |last5=Wang |first5=Xiaoshan |editor1-last=Wu |editor1-first=Taixiang |pmid=19821356 |issue=4 |pages=CD006136}}</ref>

*Potassium iodide has been used for symptomatic treatment of [[erythema nodosum]] patients for persistent lesions whose cause remains unknown. It has been used in cases of erythema nodosum associated with [[Crohn's disease]].<ref name="Marshall1997">{{cite journal |pmid=9347164 |year=1997 |last1=Marshall |first1=JK |last2=Irvine |first2=EJ |title=Successful therapy of refractory erythema nodosum associated with Crohn's disease using potassium iodide |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=501–2 |journal=Canadian journal of gastroenterology}}</ref>

===Thyroid protection during medical treatment===
[[File:Pheochromocytoma Scan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pheochromocytoma]] seen as dark sphere in center of the body. Image is by [[MIBG]] [[scintigraphy]] with radiation from radioiodine in the MIBG. However, note unwanted uptake of radioiodine from the pharmaceutical by the thyroid gland in the neck, in both images (front and back) of the same patient. Radioactivity is also seen in the bladder.]]
Thyroid iodine uptake blockade with potassium iodide is used in [[nuclear medicine]] [[scintigraphy]] and therapy with some radioiodinated compounds that are not targeted to the thyroid, such as [[iobenguane]] ([[MIBG]]), which is used to image or treat neural tissue tumors, or iodinated [[fibrinogen]], which is used in [[fibrinogen scan]]s to investigate clotting. These compounds contain iodine, but not in the iodide form. However, since they may be ultimately metabolized or break down to radioactive iodide, it is common to administer non-radioactive potassium iodide to ensure that iodide from these radiopharmaceuticals is not sequestered by the normal affinity of the thryoid for iodide.

U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]-approved dosing of potassium iodide for this purpose with iobenguane, is as follows (per 24 hours): infants less than 1 month old, 16&nbsp;mg; children 1 month to 3 years, 32&nbsp;mg; children 3 years to 18 years, 65&nbsp;mg; adults 130&nbsp;mg.<ref>Kowalsky RJ, Falen, SW. Radiopharmaceuticals in Nuclear Pharmacy and Nuclear Medicine. 2nd ed. Washington DC: American Pharmacists Association; 2004.{{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> However, some sources recommend alternative dosing regimens.<ref name="eanm.org">http://web.archive.org/web/20111007201923/https://www.eanm.org/scientific_info/guidelines/gl_paed_mibg.pdf?PHPSESSID=46d05b62d235c36a12166bf939b656c7</ref>

Not all sources are in agreement on the necessary ''duration'' of thyroid blockade, although agreement appears to have been reached about the ''necessity'' of blockade for both scintigraphic and therapeutic applications of iobenguane. Commercially available iobenguane is labeled with [[iodine-123]], and product labeling recommends administration of potassium iodide 1 hour prior to administration of the radiopharmaceutical for all age groups,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuclearpharmacy.uams.edu/resources/adreview.pdf |title=43-2035 AdreView Panel PI 091908:Layout 1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> while the European Associated of Nuclear Medicine recommends (for iobenguane labeled with either isotope,) that potassium iodide administration begin one day prior to [[radiopharmaceutical]] administration, and continue until the day following the injection, with the exception of new-borns, who do not require potassium iodide doses following radiopharmaceutical injection.<ref name="eanm.org"/><ref name="NUREG1250">US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Report on the Accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station, NUREG-1250. http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1250/</ref>

Product labeling for diagnostic iodine-131 iobenguane recommends potassium iodide administration one day before injection and continuing 5 to 7 days following administration, in keeping with the much longer half-life of this isotope and its greater danger to the thyroid.<ref>Iobenguane Sulfate I 131 Injection Diagnostic package insert. Bedford, MA: CIS-US, Inc.

===Thyroid protection due to nuclear accidents and emergencies===

In 1982, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved potassium iodide to protect [[thyroid]] glands from [[radioiodine|radioactive iodine]] involving accidents or fission emergencies.{{cn|date=April 2013}} In an accidental event or attack on a [[nuclear power plant]], or in [[Nuclear fallout|nuclear bomb fallout]],  volatile fission product radionuclides may be released. Of these products, [[iodine-131|<sup>131</sup>I]] is one of the most common and is particularly dangerous to the thyroid gland because it may lead to [[thyroid cancer]]{{cn|date=April 2013}}. By saturating the body with a source of stable iodide prior to exposure, inhaled or ingested <sup>131</sup>I tends to be excreted, which prevents radioiodine uptake by the thyroid. The protective effect of KI lasts approximately 24 hours.{{cn|date=April 2013}} For optimal [[Prophylaxis#Prophylaxis|prophylaxis]], KI must be dosed daily until a risk of significant exposure to radioiodine by either inhalation or ingestion no longer exists.

Emergency 130 '''milligrams''' potassium iodide doses provide 100&nbsp;mg iodide (the other 30&nbsp;mg is the potassium in the compound), which is roughly 700 times larger than the normal nutritional need (see [[recommended dietary allowance]]) for iodine, which is 150 '''micrograms''' (0.15&nbsp;mg) of iodine (as iodide) per day for an adult.

Potassium iodide cannot protect against any other causes of [[radiation poisoning]], nor can it provide any degree of protection against [[dirty bomb]]s that produce radionuclides other than radionuclides of iodine.{{cn|date=April 2013}} See [[fission products]] and the external links for more details concerning radionuclides.

The potassium iodide in [[iodized salt]] is insufficient for this use.<ref name=who-japan>{{cite web|title=FAQs: Japan nuclear concerns|url=http://www.who.int/hac/crises/jpn/faqs/en/index6.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>  A likely [[lethal dose]] of salt (more than a '''kilogram'''<ref name=cfr>By {{CodeFedReg|21|184|1634}}, the maximum allowable concentration of iodine in salt in the U.S. is .01%</ref>) would be needed to equal the potassium iodide in one tablet.<ref name=nacl-msds>{{cite web|url=http://ptcl.chem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/SO/sodium_chloride.html|title=Safety (MSDS) data for sodium chloride}}</ref>

The [[World Health Organization]] does not recommend KI prophylaxis for adults over 40 years, unless inhaled radiation dose levels are expected to threaten thyroid function; because, the KI side effects increases with age and may exceed the KI protective effects "...unless doses to the thyroid from inhalation rise to levels threatening thyroid function, that is of the order of about 5 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]]. Such radiation doses will not occur far away from an accident site."<ref name="WHO_Guidelines"/>

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services restated these two years later as "The downward KI (potassium iodide) dose adjustment by age group, based on body size considerations, adheres to the principle of minimum effective dose. The recommended standard (daily) dose of KI for all school-age children is the same (65 mg). However, adolescents approaching adult size (i.e., >70 kg [154 lbs]) should receive the full adult dose (130 mg) for maximal block of thyroid radioiodine uptake. Neonates ideally should receive the lowest dose (16 mg) of KI."<ref name="HHS_Guidelines">{{cite web|url=http://www.birdflumanual.com/resources/Self_Defense/files/Guidance%20for%20use%20of%20KI%20for%20nuclear%20emergency%20USG.pdf|format=PDF|title=Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)|date=December, 2001}}</ref>

SSKI (i.e., the solution of KI rather than tablets) may be used in radioiodine-contamination emergencies (i.e., nuclear accidents) to "block" the thyroid's uptake of radioiodine, at a dose of two drops of SSKI per day for an adult. This is not the same as blocking the thyroid's release of thyroid hormone, for which the adult dose is different (and is actually higher by a factor of 7 or 8), and for which KI anti-radiation pills (not a common medical treatment form of KI) are not usually available in pharmacies, or normally used in hospitals, or by physicians. Although the two forms of potassium iodide are completely interchangeable, normally in practice the SSKI solution, which is the historical medical form of high dose iodine, is generally used for all medical purposes save for radioiodine prophylaxis. For protection of the thyroid against radioiodine (iodine-131) contamination, the convenient standard 130&nbsp;mg KI pill is used if available. As noted, the equivalent two drops of SSKI may be used for this purpose, if the pills are not available.

====Historical use and analysis====
Following the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster]] in April, 1986, a saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) was administered to 10.5 million children and 7 million adults in [[Poland]]<ref name="HHS_Guidelines" /> as a prophylactic measure against accumulation of radioactive [[iodine-131]] in the [[thyroid]] gland. People in the areas immediately surrounding Chernobyl itself, however, were not given the supplement.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_english/Causes.ChernobyJF.doc|format=doc|last=Frot|first=Jacques|title=The Causes of the Chernobyl Event|publisher=Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy|coauthors=Berol Robinson (translator)}}</ref>

Potassium iodide’s (KI) value as a radiation protective (thyroid blocking) agent was demonstrated at the time of the Chernobyl nuclear accident when Soviet authorities distributed it in a 30&nbsp;km zone around the plant. The purpose was to protect residents from radioactive iodine, a highly carcinogenic material found in nuclear reactors which had been released by the damaged reactor. Only a limited amount of KI was available, but those who received it were protected. Later, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reported, “thousands of measurements of I-131 (radioactive iodine) activity...suggest that the observed levels were lower than would have been expected had this prophylactic measure not been taken. The use of KI...was credited with permissible iodine content in 97% of the evacuees tested.”<ref name="NUREG1250" />

Poland, 300 miles from Chernobyl, also distributed KI to protect its population. Approximately 18 million doses were distributed, with follow-up studies showing no known thyroid cancer among KI recipients.<ref name="AJM93">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(93)90089-8 |title=Iodide prophylaxis in Poland after the chernobyl reactor accident: Benefits and risks |year=1993 |last1=Nauman |first1=Janusz |last2=Wolff |first2=Jan |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=524–32 |pmid=8498398}}</ref> With the passage of time, people living in irradiated areas where KI was not available have developed thyroid cancer at epidemic levels, which is why the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported “The data clearly demonstrate the risks of thyroid radiation... KI can be used [to] provide safe and effective protection against thyroid cancer caused by irradiation.<ref name="FDA Talk Paper">US Food and Drug Administration, FDA Talk Paper: Guidance on Protection Against Thyroid Cancer in Case of a Nuclear Accident</ref>

Chernobyl also demonstrated that the need to protect the thyroid from radiation was greater than expected. Within ten years of the accident, it became clear that thyroid damage caused by released radioactive iodine was virtually the only adverse health effect that could be measured. As reported by the NRC, studies after the accident showed that “As of 1996, except for thyroid cancer, there has been no confirmed increase in the rates of other cancers, including leukemia, among the... public, that have been attributed to releases from the accident.”<ref name="NRC">US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Assessment of the Use of Potassium Iodide (KI) As a Public Protective Action During Severe Reactor Accidents Quoting Thyroid Cancer in Children of Belarus Following the Chernobyl Accident, NUREG-1633 http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/commission/secys/2002/secy2002-0089/attachment1.pdf {{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>

But equally important to the question of KI is the fact that radiation releases are not “local” events. Researchers at the World Health Organization accurately located and counted the cancer victims from Chernobyl and were startled to find that “the increase in incidence [of thyroid cancer] has been documented up to 500 km from the accident site... significant doses from radioactive iodine can occur hundreds of kilometers from the site, beyond emergency planning zones."<ref name="WHO_Guidelines" />  Consequently, far more people than anticipated were affected by the radiation, which caused the United Nations to report in 2002 that “The number of people with thyroid cancer... has exceeded expectations. Over 11,000 cases have already been reported.”<ref name="OCHA">United Nations: Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Chernobyl, a Continuing Catastrophe, New York and Geneva, 2000{{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>

These findings were consistent with studies of the effects of previous radiation releases. In 1945, millions of Japanese were exposed to radiation from nuclear weapons, and the effects can still be measured. Today, nearly half (44.8%) the survivors of Nagasaki studied have identifiable thyroid disease, with the American Medical Association reporting “it is remarkable that a biological effect from a single brief environmental exposure nearly 60 years in the past is still present and can be detected.”<ref name="AMA">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.295.9.1060 |title=Thyroid Disease 60 Years After Hiroshima and 20 Years After Chernobyl |year=2006 |last1=Boice |first1=J. D. |journal=JAMA |volume=295 |issue=9 |pmid=16507808 |pages=1060–2}}</ref> This, as well as the development of thyroid cancer among residents in the North Pacific from radioactive fallout following the [[Pacific Proving Grounds|United States' nuclear weapons testing]] in the 1950s (on islands nearly 200 miles downwind of the tests) were instrumental in the decision by the FDA in 1978 to issue a request for the availability of KI for thyroid protection in the event of a release from a commercial nuclear power plant or weapons-related nuclear incident. Noting that KI’s effectiveness was “virtually complete” and finding that iodine in the form of potassium iodide (KI) was substantially superior to other forms including [[Potassium iodate|iodate (KIO<sub>3</sub>)]] in terms of safety, effectiveness, lack of side effects, and speed of onset, the FDA invited manufacturers to submit applications to produce and market KI.<ref name="US Fed.

Today, three companies (Anbex, Inc., Fleming Co, and Recip of Sweden) have met the strict FDA requirements for manufacturing and testing of KI, and they offer products (IOSAT, ThyroShield, and Thyro-Safe,<ref>{{cite book |title=Toxico-terrorism: emergency response and clinical approach to chemical, biological, and radiological agents, Volume 755 |last=B.

It was reported on March 16, 2011, that potassium iodide tablets were given prophylactically to U.S. Naval air crew members flying within 70 nautical miles of the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] damaged in the massive Japanese earthquake (8.9/9.0 magnitude) and ensuing tsunami on March 11, 2011. The measures were seen as precautions, and the Pentagon said no U.S. forces have shown signs of radiation poisoning. By March 20, the US Navy instructed personnel coming within 100 miles of the reactor to take the pills.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/22/japan.nuclear.reactors/index.html|title=Vegetables near stricken plant test high for radiation|date=2011-03-22|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

==Adverse reactions==
There is reason for caution with prescribing the ingestion of high doses of potassium iodide and iodate, as their unnecessary use can cause conditions such as the [[Jod-Basedow phenomenon|Jod-Basedow phenomena]], and the [[Wolff-Chaikoff effect]], trigger and/or worsen [[hyperthyroidism]] and [[hypothyroidism]], and ultimately cause temporary or even permanent thyroid conditions. It can also cause [[sialadenitis]] (an inflammation of the salivary gland), gastrointestinal disturbances, allergic reactions and rashes. Potassium iodide is also not recommended for those who have had an allergic reaction to iodine, and people with dermatitis herpetiformis and hypocomplementemic vasculitis, conditions that are linked to a risk of iodine sensitivity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thyroid-info.com/potassium-iodide.htm |title=Information on Radiation, Health and the Thyroid, Including Iodine Testing, Potassium Iodide, and Thyroid Testing |publisher=Thyroid-info.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref>

There have been some reports of potassium iodide treatment causing swelling of the [[parotid gland]] (one of the three [[glands]] which secrete [[saliva]]), due to its stimulatory effects on saliva production.<ref name="Pathophysiology">McCance; Huether. "Pathophysiology: The biological basis for disease in Adults and Children". 5th Edition. Elsievier Publishing{{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>

A saturated solution of KI (SSKI) is typically given orally in adult doses of about 250&nbsp;mg iodide several times a day (5 drops of SSKI assumed to be ⅓ ml) for thyroid blockade (to prevent the thyroid from excreting thyroid hormone) and occasionally this dose is also used, when iodide is used as an expectorant (the total dose is about one gram KI per day for an adult). The anti-radioiodine doses used for [[I-131]] uptake blockade are lower, and range downward from 100&nbsp;mg a day for an adult, to less than this for children (see table). All of these doses should be compared with the far lower dose of iodine needed in normal nutrition, which is only 150&nbsp;μg per day (150 '''micrograms''', not milligrams).

At maximal doses, and sometimes at much lower doses, side effects of iodide used for medical reasons, in doses of 1000 times the normal nutrional need, may include: acne, loss of appetite, or upset stomach (especially during the first several days, as the body adjusts to the medication). More severe side effects which require notification of a physician are: fever, weakness, unusual tiredness, swelling in the neck or throat, mouth sores, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, irregular heartbeat, numbness or tingling of the hands or feet, or a metallic taste in the mouth.<ref>{{cite web|author=March 23, 2011 |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/potassium_iodide-oral/article.htm |title=POTASSIUM IODIDE - ORAL (SSKI) side effects, medical uses, and drug interactions |publisher=Medicinenet.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>

The administration of known [[goitrogen]] substances can also be used as a [[prophylaxis]] in reducing the bio-uptake of iodine, (whether it be the nutritional non-radioactive [[iodine-127]] or radioactive iodine, radioiodine - most commonly [[iodine-131]], as the body cannot discern between different iodine [[isotopes]]).
[[perchlorate]] ions, a common water contaminant in the USA due to the [[aerospace industry]], has been shown to reduce iodine uptake and thus is classified as a [[goitrogen]]. Perchlorate ions are a competitive inhibitor of the process by which iodide, is actively deposited into thyroid follicular cells. Studies involving healthy adult volunteers determined that at levels above 0.007 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/(kg·d)), perchlorate begins to temporarily inhibit the thyroid gland’s ability to absorb iodine from the bloodstream ("iodide uptake inhibition", thus perchlorate is a known goitrogen).<ref name="bare_url">{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.02110927 |title=Health Effects Assessment for Environmental Perchlorate Contamination: The Dose Response for Inhibition of Thyroidal Radioiodine Uptake in Humans |year=2002 |last1=Greer |first1=Monte A. |last2=Goodman |first2=Gay |last3=Pleus |first3=Richard C. |last4=Greer |first4=Susan E. |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=110 |issue=9 |pages=927–37 |pmid=12204829 |pmc=1240994}}</ref>
The reduction of the iodide pool by perchlorate has dual effects – reduction of excess hormone synthesis and hyperthyroidism, on the one hand, and reduction of thyroid inhibitor synthesis and hypothyroidism on the other. Perchlorate remains very useful as a single dose application in tests measuring the discharge of radioiodide accumulated in the thyroid as a result of many different disruptions in the further metabolism of iodide in the thyroid gland.<ref name="ncbi">{{cite journal |pmid=9549759 |year=1998 |last1=Wolff |first1=J |title=Perchlorate and the thyroid gland |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=89–105 |journal=Pharmacological reviews}}</ref>

Treatment of thyrotoxicosis (including Graves' disease) with 600-2,000&nbsp;mg potassium perchlorate (430-1,400&nbsp;mg perchlorate) daily for periods of several months or longer was once common practice, particularly in Europe,<ref name="bare_url" /><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=4290684 |year=1966 |last1=Barzilai |first1=D |last2=Sheinfeld |first2=M |title=Fatal complications following use of potassium perchlorate in thyrotoxicosis.

Current regimens for treatment of [[thyrotoxicosis]] (including Graves' disease), when a patient is exposed to additional sources of Iodine, commonly include 500&nbsp;mg potassium perchlorate twice per day for 18–40 days.<ref name="bare_url" /><ref name="ncbi_a">{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.81.8.2930 |title=Treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, a difficult challenge: Results of a prospective study |year=1996 |last1=Bartalena |first1=L. |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism |volume=81 |issue=8 |pmid=8768854 |pages=2930–3 |last2=Brogioni |first2=S |last3=Grasso |first3=L |last4=Bogazzi |first4=F |last5=Burelli |first5=A |last6=Martino |first6=E}}</ref>

Prophylaxis with perchlorate containing water at concentrations of 17 [[Parts per million|ppm]], which corresponds to 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg-day personal intake, if one is 70&nbsp;kg and consumes 2 litres of water per day, was found to reduce baseline radioiodine uptake by 67%<ref name="bare_url" /> This is equivalent to ingesting a total of just 35&nbsp;mg of Perchlorate ions per day. In another related study were subjects drank just 1 litre of perchlorate containing water per day at a concentration of 10 ppm, i.e. daily 10&nbsp;mg of Perchlorate ions  were ingested, an average 38% reduction in the uptake of Iodine was observed.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/10507250050137734 |title=The Effect of Short-Term Low-Dose Perchlorate on Various Aspects of Thyroid Function |year=2000 |last1=Lawrence |first1=J.

However when the average perchlorate absorption in perchlorate plant workers subjected to the highest exposure has been estimated as approximately 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg-day, as in the above paragraph, a 67% reduction of iodine uptake would be expected. Studies of chronically exposed workers though have thus far failed to detect any abnormalities of thyroid function, including the uptake of iodine.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00043764-199904000-00006 |title=Thyroid Health Status of Ammonium Perchlorate Workers: A Cross-Sectional Occupational Health Study |year=1999 |last1=Lamm |first1=Steven H. |last2=Braverman |first2=Lewis E. |last3=Li |first3=Feng Xiao |last4=Richman |first4=Kent |last5=Pino |first5=Sam |last6=Howearth |first6=Gregory |journal=Journal of Occupational & Environmental Medicine |volume=41 |issue=4 |pmid=10224590 |pages=248–60}}</ref> this may well be attributable to sufficient daily exposure or intake of healthy Iodine-127 among the workers and the short 8 hr [[Biological half life]] of Perchlorate in the body.<ref name="bare_url" />

To completely block the uptake of Iodine-131 by the purposeful addition of perchlorate ions to a populaces water supply, aiming at dosages of 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg-day, or a water concentration of 17 ppm, would therefore be grossly inadequate at truly reducing radioiodine uptake. Perchlorate ion concentrations in a regions water supply, would need to be much higher, at least 7.15&nbsp;mg/kg of body weight per day or a water concentration of 250 [[Parts per million|ppm]],assuming people drink 2 liters of water per day, to be truly beneficial to the population at preventing [[bioaccumulation]] when exposed to a radioiodine environment,<ref name="bare_url" /><ref name="ncbi_a" /> independent of the availability of [[Iodate]] or [[Iodide]] drugs.

The continual distribution of perchlorate tablets or the addition of perchlorate to the water supply would need to continue for no less than 80–90 days, beginning immediately after the initial release of radioiodine was detected, after 80–90 days had passed released radioactive iodine-131 would have decayed to less than 0.1% of its initial quantity at which time the danger from biouptake of iodine-131 is essentially over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/nuclear-chemistry-halflives-and-radioactive-dating.html |title=Nuclear Chemistry: Half-Lives and Radioactive Dating - For Dummies |publisher=Dummies.com |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref>

In the event of a radioiodine release the ingestion of prophylaxis potassium iodide, if available, or even iodate, would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be the first line of defense in protecting the population from a radioiodine release. However in the event of a radioiodine release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide & iodate prophylaxis drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets would serve as a cheap, efficacious, second line of defense against [[carcinogenic]] radioiodine bioaccumulation.

The ingestion of goitrogen drugs is, much like potassium iodide also not without its dangers, such as [[hypothyroidism]]. In all these cases however, despite the risks, the prophylaxis benefits of intervention with iodide, iodate or perchlorate outweigh the serious cancer risk from radioiodine [[bioaccumulation]] in regions were radioiodine has sufficiently contaminatated the environment.

==Precautions==
Potassium iodide is a mild irritant and should be handled with gloves. Chronic overexposure can have adverse effects on the thyroid. Potassium iodide is a possible [[Teratology|teratogen]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
