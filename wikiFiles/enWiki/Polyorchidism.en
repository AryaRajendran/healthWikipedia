'''Polyorchidism''' is the incidence of [[supernumerary body part|more than two]] [[testicles]]. It is a very loose [[congenital disorder]], with fewer than 200 cases reported in medical literature.<ref name=BergHolz2009>{{Cite pmid|19765760}}</ref> Polyorchidism is generally diagnosed via an [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] examination of the testicles. The most common form is triorchidism, or tritestes, where three testicles are present. The condition is usually [[asymptomatic]].  A man who has polyorchidism is known as a '''polyorchid'''.

== Classification ==
[[File:Tritestes ultrasound.jpg|thumb|alt=Ultrasound scan of Type A3 polyorchidism|Ultrasound scan of Type A3 polyorchidism, with annotations showing the superior and inferior testes and the head and tail of the epididymis]]
Polyorchidism occurs in two primary forms: Type A and Type B.<ref name=BergHolz2009/>

* Type A: The supernumerary testicle is connected to a [[vas deferens]]. These testicles are usually reproductively functional. Type A is further subdivided into:
** Type A1: Complete duplication of the testicle, [[epididymis]] and [[vas deferens]].
** Type A2: The supernumerary testicle has its own [[epididymis]] and shares a [[vas deferens]].
** Type A3: The supernumerary testicle shares the [[epididymis]] and the [[vas deferens]] of the other testicles.
* Type B: The supernumerary testicle is not connected to a [[vas deferens]] and is therefore not reproductively functional. Type B is further subdivided into:
** Type B1: The supernumerary testicle has its own [[epididymis]] but is not connected to a [[vas deferens]]
** Type B2: The supernumerary testicle consists only of testicular tissue.

Type A3 is the most common form of polyorchidism, and types A2 and A3 together account for more than 90% of cases.<ref name=Leung1988/> In 65% of cases, the supernumerary testicle is found in the left scrotal sac.<ref name=BergHolz2009/>

=== Numeric system ===

An older system of classification structures polyorchidism into similar types, but with no subdivision<ref name=Leung1988>{{cite journal |last1=Leung |first1=A. K. |year=1988 |title=Polyorchidism |journal= American Fam Physician |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=153â€“156}}</ref> between connected and disconnected testicles:

* Type 1: The [[wiktionary:supernumerary|supernumerary]] testicle lacks an [[epididymis]] and [[vas deferens]] and has no connection to the other testicles.
* Type 2: The supernumerary testicle shares the [[epididymis]] and the [[vas deferens]] of the other testicles.
* Type 3: The supernumerary testicle has its own [[epididymis]] and shares a [[vas deferens]].
* Type 4: Complete duplication of the testicle, [[epididymis]] and [[vas deferens]].

==Complications==
Most cases of polyorchidism are [[asymptomatic]], and are discovered incidentally, in the course of treating another condition. In the majority of cases, the supernumerary testicle is found in the scrotum.<ref name=BergHolz2009/> 

However, polyorchidism can occur in conjunction with [[cryptorchidism]], where the supernumerary testicle is undescended or found elsewhere in the body. These cases are associated with a significant increase in the incidence of testicular cancer: 0.004% for the general population vs 5.7% for a supernumerary testicle not found in the scrotum.<ref name=BergHolz2009/> 

Polyorchidism can also occur in conjunction with [[infertility]], [[inguinal hernia]], [[testicular torsion]], [[epididymitis]], [[hydrocele testis]] and [[varicocele]].<ref name=Kundu>{{cite journal |last1=Kundu |first1=A |last2=et al |title=Triorchidism : An Incidental Finding And Review Of Literature |url=http://medind.nic.in/jae/t01/i1/jaet01i1p37.pdf |accessdate=2012-03-21 }}</ref> However, it is not clear whether polyorchidism causes or aggravates these conditions, or whether the existence of these conditions leads sufferers to seek medical attention and thus become diagnosed with a previously undetected supernumerary testicle.

==Management==
Because polyorchidism is very uncommon, there is no standard treatment for the condition. Prior to advances in [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound technology]], it was common practice to remove the supernumerary testicle.<ref name=Leung1988/> Several cases have been described where routine follow-up examinations conducted over a period of years showed that the supernumerary testicle was stable.<ref name=BergHolz2009/>

A recent [[meta-analysis]] suggested [[orchiectomy|removing]] non-scrotal supernumerary testicles because of the increased risk of cancer, and regular follow-up in the remaining cases to ensure that the supernumerary testicle remains stable.<ref name=BergHolz2009/>
