==Relationship with Diana, Princess of Wales==
Khan has been widely identified as an "ex-lover"<ref name=murd>{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23025535-663,00.html | title=Princess Diana's ex-lover Hasnat Khan to give evidence | location=Victoria, Australia | newspaper=Herald Sun | date=9 January 2008 | accessdate=24 August 2008}}</ref> and "boyfriend" of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. The relationship ended in July 1997, according to [[Paul Burrell]], Diana's butler.<ref name=tele>{{cite news | first=Gordon | last=Rayner | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/14/ndiana514.xml | title=Diana 'planned secret wedding to Hasnat Khan' | location=London | newspaper=Telegraph | date=16 January 2008 | accessdate=24 August 2008}}</ref>

In March 2008, Khan said in a written statement to Lord Justice [[Scott Baker (judge)|Scott Baker]]'s [[inquest]] into Diana's death that their relationship had begun in the late summer of 1995, and that although they had talked about getting married, he believed that he would find the inevitable media attention "hell". He also said that he believed that the accident which caused Diana's death was a "tragic accident".<ref name=bbcn>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7275130.stm "Diana jury told of surgeon affair"], ''BBC News'', 3 March 2008, accessed 2008-08-24.</ref> The heart surgeon told the court on 3 March 2008 that he doubted she had been pregnant when she died because she always took her [[contraception|contraceptive pills]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Khan had met Diana at the [[Royal Brompton Hospital]], where she was visiting a friend recovering from heart surgery. They pursued a discreet two-year affair that finished a few months before her death in a car crash in 1997. Diana's friends are reported to have described Khan as the 'love of her life' and to have spoken of her distress when he ended their relationship.<ref name=jhel>{{cite news | first1=Massoud | last1=Ansari | first2=Andrew | last2=Alderson | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575413/Dr-Hasnat-Khan-Princess-Diana-and-me.html | title=Dr Hasnat Khan: Princess Diana and me | location=London | newspaper=Sunday Telegraph | date=16 January 2008 | accessdate=25 August 2008}}</ref> He, however, is said to be reticent about speaking of how much he may have meant to her or even how much she meant to him. Many of Diana's friends believe she was using [[Dodi Fayed]] in order to make Hasnat jealous and win him back.<ref name=indi />
