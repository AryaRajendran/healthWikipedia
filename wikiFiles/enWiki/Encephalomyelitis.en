* ''[[Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]]'' or ''postinfectious encephalomyelitis'', a [[demyelinating disease]] of the brain and spinal cord, possibly triggered by [[virus|viral]] infection;<ref>{{RareDiseases|8639|Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis}}</ref><ref>{{NINDS|acute_encephalomyelitis|Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis Information Page}}</ref>
* ''Encephalomyelitis disseminata'', a synonym for [[multiple sclerosis]];
* ''[[Equine encephalomyelitis]]'', a potentially fatal [[mosquito]]-borne viral disease that infects [[horses]] and humans;
* ''[[Myalgic encephalomyelitis]]'', a syndrome involving inflammation of the central nervous system with symptoms of muscle pain and fatigue; the term has sometimes been used interchangeably with ''[[chronic fatigue syndrome]]'', though there is still controversy over the distinction.<ref>{{RareDiseases|7121|Myalgic encephalomyelitis}}</ref>
