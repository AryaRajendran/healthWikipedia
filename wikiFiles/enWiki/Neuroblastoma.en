'''Neuroblastoma''' ('''NB''') is the most common extracranial solid [[cancer]] in childhood and the most common cancer in infancy, with an annual incidence of about six hundred and fifty cases per year in the U.S.,<ref name="titleeMedicine - Neuroblastoma : Article by Norman J Lacayo, MD">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1570.htm |title=eMedicine - Neuroblastoma : Article by Norman J Lacayo, MD |accessdate=2008-07-30 |work=}}</ref> and a hundred cases per year in the U.K.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Neuroblastoma/Pages/Introduction.aspx NHS Website]</ref> Nearly half of neuroblastoma cases occur in children younger than two years.<ref>Janet Sassi, [http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/public_affairs/inside_fordham/february_16_2007/in_focus_faculty_and/cellular_communicati_24950.asp "Cellular Communication: Unraveling the Secrets of Histone Proteins"], Fordham University, February 16, 2007</ref> It is a [[neuroendocrine tumor]], arising from any [[neural crest]] element of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] (S.N.S.). It most frequently originates in one of the [[adrenal gland]]s, but can also develop in nerve tissues in the [[neck]], [[chest]], [[abdomen]], or [[pelvis]].

[[Esthesioneuroblastoma]], also known as olfactory neuroblastoma, is believed to arise from the [[olfactory epithelium]] and its classification remains controversial. However, since it is not a sympathetic nervous system malignancy, esthesioneuroblastoma is a distinct clinical entity and is not to be confused with neuroblastoma.<ref name="titleeMedicine - Esthesioneuroblastoma : Article by Pavel Dulguerov, MD">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic748.htm |title=eMedicine - Esthesioneuroblastoma : Article by Pavel Dulguerov, MD |accessdate=2008-07-30 |work=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Cheung| first = Nai-Kong| title = Neuroblastoma| publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]| series = p. 73| year = 2005| isbn = 3-540-40841-X }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The first [[symptom]]s of neuroblastoma are often vague making diagnosis difficult. [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]], [[loss of appetite]], [[fever]], and joint pain are common. Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present:<ref name="titleNeuroblastoma in children : Cancerbackup">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/cancertype/childrenscancers/typesofchildrenscancers/neuroblastoma#9216 |title=Neuroblastoma in children : Cancerbackup |accessdate=2008-01-01 |work=}}</ref>

* In the [[abdomen]], a tumor may cause a [[swollen belly]] and [[constipation]].
* A tumor in the [[chest]] may cause [[breathing problems]].
* A tumor pressing on the [[spinal cord]] may cause [[weakness]] and thus an inability to stand, crawl, or walk.
* Bone lesions in the legs and hips may cause pain and limping.
* A tumor in the bones around the eyes or [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] may cause distinct bruising and swelling.
* Infiltration of the bone marrow may cause [[pallor]] from [[anemia]].

Neuroblastoma often spreads to other parts of the body before any symptoms are apparent and 50 to 60% of all neuroblastoma cases present with [[metastasis|metastases]].<ref name="titleNeuroblastoma: Pediatric Cancers: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec19/ch285/ch285b.html |title=Neuroblastoma: Pediatric Cancers: Merck Manual Professional |accessdate=2008-01-01 |work=}}</ref>

The most common location for neuroblastoma to originate (i.e., the primary tumor) is on the adrenal glands.  This occurs in 40% of localized tumors and in 60% of cases of widespread disease. Neuroblastoma can also develop anywhere along the sympathetic nervous system chain from the neck to the pelvis.  Frequencies in different locations include: neck (1%), chest (19%), abdomen (30% non-adrenal), or pelvis (1%). In rare cases, no primary tumor can be discerned.<ref name="pmid17943963">{{cite journal |author=Friedman GK, Castleberry RP |title=Changing trends of research and treatment in infant neuroblastoma |journal=Pediatr Blood Cancer |volume=49 |issue=7 Suppl |pages=1060–5 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17943963 |doi=10.1002/pbc.21354}}</ref>

Rare but characteristic presentations include transverse [[myelopathy]] (tumor spinal cord compression, 5% of cases), treatment-resistant diarrhea (tumor [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]] secretion, 4% of cases), [[Horner's syndrome]] (cervical tumor, 2.4% of cases), [[opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome]]<ref name="pmid19430769">{{cite journal |author=Rothenberg AB, Berdon WE, D'Angio GJ, Yamashiro DJ, Cowles RA |title=The association between neuroblastoma and opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome: a historical review |journal=Pediatr Radiol |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=723–6 |year=2009 |month=July |isbn=2-470-09128-2 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |pmid=19430769 |doi=10.1007/s00247-009-1282-x}}</ref> and [[ataxia]] (suspected [[paraneoplastic]] cause, 1.3% of cases), and [[hypertension]] ([[catecholamine]] secretion or renal artery compression, 1.3% of cases).<ref>{{cite book

== Cause ==
The [[etiology]] of neuroblastoma is not well understood.  The great majority of cases are sporadic and non-familial. About 1-2% of cases run in families and have been linked to specific gene mutations.  Familial neuroblastoma in some cases is caused by rare germline mutations in the [[anaplastic lymphoma kinase]] (ALK) gene.<ref name="pmid18724359">{{cite journal |author=Mossé YP, Laudenslager M, Longo L, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of ALK as a major familial neuroblastoma predisposition gene |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7215 |pages=930–5 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18724359 |doi=10.1038/nature07261 |pmc=2672043}}</ref> Germline mutations in the [[PHOX2A]] or [[KIF1B]] gene have been implicated in familial neuroblastoma as well. Neuroblastoma is also a feature of [[neurofibromatosis type 1]] and the [[Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]].   

[[N-myc]] [[oncogene]] amplification within the tumor is a common finding in neuroblastoma. The degree of amplification shows a bimodal distribution: either 3- to 10-fold, or 100- to 300-fold. The presence of this mutation is highly correlated to advanced stages of disease.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1126/science.6719137}}</ref>

Duplicated segments of the [[LMO1]] gene within neuroblastoma tumor cells have been shown to increase the risk of developing an aggressive form of the cancer.<ref name="lmo1_contributor">{{cite report |title=New Gene For Childhood Cancer Neuroblastoma Is Discovered |website=NewsWise |year=2010 |month=November |url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/new-gene-for-childhood-cancer-neuroblastoma-is-discovered}}</ref>

Neuroblastoma has been linked to [[copy-number variation]] within the [[NBPF10]] gene, which results in the [[1q21.1 deletion syndrome]] or [[1q21.1 duplication syndrome]].<ref>Copy number variation at 1q21.1 associated with neuroblastoma; Diskin et al.; Nature 459, 987-991 (18 June 2009) | {{doi|10.1038/nature08035}}; Received 14 December 2008; Accepted 30 March 2009</ref>

Several risk factors have been proposed and are the subject of ongoing research. Due to characteristic early onset many studies have focused on parental factors around [[fertilisation|conception]] and during [[gestation]]. Factors investigated have included occupation (i.e. exposure to chemicals in specific industries), smoking, alcohol consumption, use of medicinal drugs during pregnancy and birth factors; however, results have been inconclusive.<ref>Olshan, AF, Bunin, GR (2000) Epidemiology of Neuroblastoma.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Neuroblastoma mets.JPG|thumb|MRI showing orbital and skull vault metastatic NB in 2 year old]]
The diagnosis is usually confirmed by a [[anatomical pathology|surgical pathologist]], taking into account the clinical presentation, microscopic findings, and other laboratory tests.

===Biochemistry===
In about 90% of cases of neuroblastoma, elevated levels of [[catecholamines]] or their metabolites are found in the urine or blood. Catecholamines and their metabolites include [[dopamine]], [[homovanillic acid]] (HVA), and/or [[vanillylmandelic acid]] (VMA).<ref name="pmid16732582">{{cite journal |author=Strenger V, Kerbl R, Dornbusch HJ, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnostic and prognostic impact of urinary catecholamines in neuroblastoma patients |journal=Pediatr Blood Cancer |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=504–9 |year=2007 |pmid=16732582 |doi=10.1002/pbc.20888}}</ref>

===Imaging===
Another way to detect neuroblastoma is the [[mIBG]] scan (meta-iodobenzylguanidine), which is taken up by 90 to 95% of all neuroblastomas, often termed "mIBG-avid."<ref name="pmid17544628"/> The mechanism is that mIBG is taken up by sympathetic neurons, and is a functioning analog of the neurotransmitter [[norepinephrine]]. When it is radio-ionated with [[I-131]] or I-123 (radioactive iodine [[isotopes]]), it is a very good [[radiopharmaceutical]] for diagnosis and monitoring of response to treatment for this disease. With a [[half-life]] of 13 hours, I-123 is the preferred isotope for imaging sensitivity and quality. I-131 has a half-life of 8 days and at higher doses is an effective therapy as targeted radiation against relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma.<ref name="pmid15653652">{{cite journal |author=Pashankar F, O'Dorisio M, Menda Y |title=MIBG and somatostatin receptor analogs in children: current concepts on diagnostic and therapeutic use |journal=Journal of Nuclear Medicine |volume=46 |issue=1 (suppl) |pages=55S–61S |year=2005 |pmid=15653652 |url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/46/1_suppl/55S}}</ref>

=== Histology ===
[[File:Neuroblastoma.jpg|thumb|microscopic view of stroma-rich ganglioneuroblastoma]]
On microscopy, the tumor cells are typically described as small, round and blue, and [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] patterns ([[James Homer Wright|Homer-Wright]] pseudo-rosettes) may be seen. Homer-Wright pseudorosettes, are tumor cells around neuropil, not to be confused with true rosettes (Flexner-Wintersteiner) <ref>http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Flexner-Wintersteiner+rosette</ref> which are tumor cells around a blood vessel often seen in retinoblastomas.<ref name="pmid11844067">{{cite journal |author=Miura K, Mineta H, Yokota N, Tsutsui Y |title=Olfactory neuroblastoma with epithelial and endocrine differentiation transformed into ganglioneuroma after chemoradiotherapy |journal=Pathol.

Neuroblastoma is one of the peripheral neuroblastic [[tumors]] (pNTs) that have similar origins and show a wide pattern of differentiation ranging from [[benign]] [[ganglioneuroma]] to [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]]-rich [[ganglioneuroblastoma]] with neuroblastic cells intermixed or in nodules, to highly malignant neuroblastoma. This distinction in the pre-treatment tumor pathology is an important prognostic factor, along with age and [[mitosis]]-[[karyorrhexis]] index (MKI). This pathology classification system describes "favorable" and "unfavorable" tumors by the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Committee (INPC, also called Shimada system) which was established in 1999 and revised in 2003.<ref name="pmid14601099">{{cite journal |author=Peuchmaur M, d'Amore ES, Joshi VV, ''et al.'' |title=Revision of the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification: confirmation of favorable and unfavorable prognostic subsets in ganglioneuroblastoma, nodular |journal=Cancer |volume=98 |issue=10 |pages=2274–81 |year=2003 |pmid=14601099 |doi=10.1002/cncr.11773}}</ref>

===Staging===
The "International Neuroblastoma Staging System" (INSS) established in 1986 and revised in 1988 stratifies neuroblastoma according to its anatomical presence at diagnosis:<ref name="titleNeuroblastoma Treatment - National Cancer Institute">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/neuroblastoma/HealthProfessional/page3#Section_185 |title=Neuroblastoma Treatment - National Cancer Institute |accessdate=2008-07-30 |work=}}</ref><ref name="pmid3199170">{{cite journal |author=Brodeur GM, Seeger RC, Barrett A, ''et al.'' |title=International criteria for diagnosis, staging, and response to treatment in patients with neuroblastoma |journal=J.

*Stage 1: Localized tumor confined to the area of origin.

*Stage 2A: Unilateral tumor with incomplete gross resection; identifiable ipsilateral and contralateral lymph node negative for tumor.

*Stage 2B: Unilateral tumor with complete or incomplete gross resection; with ipsilateral lymph node positive for tumor; identifiable contralateral lymph node negative for tumor.
    
*Stage 3: Tumor infiltrating across midline with or without regional lymph node involvement; or unilateral tumor with contralateral lymph node involvement; or midline tumor with bilateral lymph node involvement.

*Stage 4: Dissemination of tumor to distant lymph nodes, bone marrow, bone, liver, or other organs except as defined by Stage 4S.

*Stage 4S: Age <1 year old with localized primary tumor as defined in Stage 1 or 2, with dissemination limited to liver, skin, or bone marrow (less than 10 percent of nucleated bone marrow cells are tumors).

Although international agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, the need for an international consensus on risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma patients treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12-18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12-18 month old children without N-''myc'' (also commonly referred to as [[MYCN]]) amplification to intermediate risk category.<ref name="pmid16116154">{{cite journal |author=Schmidt ML, Lal A, Seeger RC, Maris JM, Shimada H, O'Leary M, Gerbing RB, Matthay KK |title=Favorable prognosis for patients 12 to 18 months of age with stage 4 nonamplified MYCN neuroblastoma: a Children's Cancer Group Study |journal=J Clin Oncol |volume=23 |issue=27 |pages=6474–80 |year=2005 |pmid=16116154 |doi= 10.1200/JCO.2005.05.183|url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/full/23/27/6474}}</ref>

The new INRG risk assignment will classify neuroblastoma at diagnosis based on a new International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS):

*Stage L1: Localized disease without image-defined risk factors.

*Stage L2: Localized disease with image-defined risk factors.

*Stage M: Metastatic disease.

*Stage MS: Metastatic disease "special" where MS is equivalent to stage 4S.

The new risk stratification will be based on the new INRGSS staging system, age (dichotomized at 18 months), tumor grade, [[N-myc]] amplification, unbalanced 11q aberration, and [[ploidy]] into four pre-treatment risk groups: very low, low, intermediate, and high risk.<ref name="pmid17586306">{{cite journal |author=Maris JM, Hogarty MD, Bagatell R, Cohn SL |title=Neuroblastoma |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9579 |pages=2106–20 |year=2007 |pmid=17586306 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60983-0 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(07)60983-0}}</ref><ref name="pmid">{{cite journal |author=Cohn SL, London WB, Monclair T, Matthay KK, Ambros PF, Pearson AD, for the INRG Working Group |title=Update on the development of the international neuroblastoma risk group (INRG) classification schema |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology 2007 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings Part 1 |volume=25 |issue=18S |year=2007|url=http://www.asco.org/ASCO/Abstracts+&+Virtual+Meeting/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=47&abstractID=30945 |format=abstract}}</ref>

When the [[lesion]] is localized, it is generally curable. However, long-term survival for children with advanced disease older than 18 months of age is poor despite aggressive [[multimodal therapy]] (intensive [[chemotherapy]], [[surgery]], [[radiation therapy]], [[stem cell transplant]], [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]] agent [[isotretinoin]] also called 13-''cis''-retinoic acid, and frequently [[immunotherapy]]<ref name="pmid18081947">{{cite journal |author=Johnson E, Dean SM, Sondel PM |title=Antibody-based immunotherapy in high-risk neuroblastoma |journal=[[Expert Rev Mol Med]] |volume=9 |issue=34 |pages=1–21 |year=2007 |pmid=18081947 |doi=10.1017/S1462399407000518 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1462399407000518 |format=abstract}}</ref> with anti-[[GD2]] [[monoclonal antibody therapy]]).

With current treatments, patients with low and intermediate risk disease have an excellent prognosis with cure rates above 90% for low risk and 70%-90% for intermediate risk. In contrast, therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma the past two decades resulted in cures only about 30% of the time.<ref name="titleNeuroblastoma Treatment - National Cancer Institute (2)">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/neuroblastoma/HealthProfessional/page3#Section_17 |title=Neuroblastoma Treatment - National Cancer Institute |accessdate=2008-07-30 |work=}}</ref> The addition of antibody therapy has raised survival rates for high-risk disease significantly. In March 2009 an early analysis of a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study with 226 high-risk patients showed that two years after stem cell transplant 66% of the group randomized to received ch14.18 antibody with [[GM-CSF]] and [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]] were alive and disease-free compared to only 46% in the group that did not receive the antibody.

Chemotherapy agents used in combination have been found to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds ([[cisplatin]], [[carboplatin]]), alkylating agents ([[cyclophosphamide]], [[ifosfamide]], [[melphalan]]), [[topoisomerase]] II inhibitor ([[etoposide]]), [[anthracycline]] antibiotics ([[doxorubicin]]) and vinca [[alkaloids]] ([[vincristine]]). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors ([[topotecan]] and [[irinotecan]]) in induction which have been found to be effective against recurrent disease.

==Prognosis==
Between 20% and 50% of high-risk cases do not respond adequately to induction high-dose chemotherapy and are progressive or refractory.<ref name="urlReduction From Seven to Five Cycles of Intensive Induction Chemotherapy in Children With High-Risk Neuroblastoma -- Kushner et al. 22 (24): 4888 -- Journal of Clinical Oncology">{{cite web |url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/full/22/24/4888 |title=Reduction From Seven to Five Cycles of Intensive Induction Chemotherapy in Children With High-Risk Neuroblastoma -- Kushner et al. 22 (24): 4888 -- Journal of Clinical Oncology |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="titleResponse and toxicity to a dose-intensive multi-agent chemotherapy induction regimen for high risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB): A Childrens Oncology Group (COG A3973) study. - ASCO">{{cite web |url=http://www.asco.org/ASCO/Abstracts+%26+Virtual+Meeting/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=47&abstractID=31659 |title=Response and toxicity to a dose-intensive multi-agent chemotherapy induction regimen for high risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB): A Children's Oncology Group (COG A3973) study. - ASCO |accessdate=2008-02-02 |work=}}</ref> Relapse after completion of frontline therapy is also common.

Most long-term survivors alive today had low or intermediate risk disease and milder courses of treatment compared to high-risk disease. The majority of survivors have long-term effects from the treatment. Survivors of intermediate and high-risk treatment often experience hearing loss.

===Cytogenetic profiles===
Based on a series of 493 neuroblastoma samples, it has been reported that overall genomic pattern, as tested by [[Virtual Karyotype|array-based karyotyping]], is a predictor of outcome in neuroblastoma:<ref name="pmid19171713">{{cite journal |author=Janoueix-Lerosey I, Schleiermacher G, Michels E, ''et al.'' |title=Overall genomic pattern is a predictor of outcome in neuroblastoma |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=1026–33 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19171713 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2008.16.0630 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19171713}}</ref>
*Tumors presenting exclusively with whole chromosome copy number changes were associated with excellent survival.
*Tumors presenting with any kind of segmental chromosome copy number changes were associated with a high risk of relapse.
*Within tumors showing segmental alterations, additional independent predictors of decreased overall survival were [[N-myc]] amplification, 1p and 11q deletions, and 1q gain.

Earlier publications categorized neuroblastomas into three major subtypes based on cytogenetic profiles:<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vandesompele J, Baudis M, Preter K De, Roy N Van, Ambros P, Bown N, Brinkschmidt C, Christiansen H, Combaret V ''et al.'' | year = 2005 | title = Unequivocal delineation of clinicogenetic subgroups and development of a new model for improved outcome prediction in neuroblastoma | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 10 | issue = 23| pages = 2280–2299 }}</ref><ref>Michels, E; Vandesompele, J; Hoebeeck, J; Menten, B; De Preter, K; Laureys, G; Van Roy, N; Speleman, F.

[PubMed]</ref>
*Subtype 1: favorable neuroblastoma with near triploidy and a predominance of numerical gains and losses, mostly representing non-metastatic NB stages 1, 2 and 4S.
*Subtypes 2A and 2B: found in unfavorable widespread neuroblastoma, stages 3 and 4, with 11q loss and 17q gain without N-myc amplification (subtype 2A) or with N-myc amplification often together with 1p deletions and 17q gain (subtype 2B).

[[Virtual Karyotype|Virtual karyotyping]] can be performed on fresh or paraffin-embedded tumors to assess copy number at these loci. SNP array virtual karyotyping is preferred for tumor samples, including neuroblastomas, because they can detect copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (acquired uniparental disomy). Copy neutral LOH can be biologically equivalent to a deletion and has been detected at key loci in neuroblastoma.<ref>Carén H, Erichsen J, Olsson L, Enerbäck C, Sjöberg RM, Abrahamsson J, Kogner P, Martinsson T.

BMC Genomics. 2008 Jul 29;9:353.</ref> ArrayCGH, FISH, or conventional cytogenetics cannot detect copy neutral LOH.

==Epidemiology==
Neuroblastoma comprises 6-10% of all childhood cancers, and 15% of cancer deaths in children. The annual mortality rate is 10 per million children in the 0- to 4-year-old age group, and 4 per million in the 4- to 9-year old age group.<ref>Brodeur  GM, Castleberry RP. Neuroblastoma. In: Pizzo PA, Poplack DG. Principles and practice of pediatric oncology, 3rd ed. 1997:761-797.</ref>

==History==
[[File:Rudolf Virchow.jpg|thumb|[[Rudolf Virchow]]: the first to describe an abdominal tumor in a child as a "glioma"]]
In 1864 German physician [[Rudolf Virchow]] was the first to describe an abdominal tumor in a child as a "glioma".

By contrast, focus the past 20 years or more has been to intensify treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma. Chemotherapy induction variations, timing of surgery, stem cell transplant regimens, various delivery schemes for radiation, and use of monoclonal antibodies and retinoids to treat minimal residual disease continue to be examined. Recent phase III [[clinical trials]] with randomization have been carried out to answer these questions to improve survival of high-risk disease:

In addition to these phase III studies, some research institutions offer pilot treatment protocols. For example, St Jude's recently finished (2007) testing a new up-front chemotherapy regimen in 23 children which included [[irinotecan]] and [[gefitinib]] with 16 months of maintenance chemotherapy after stem cell transplant with alternating oral 13-cis-retinoic acid and [[topotecan]].<ref name="titleNeuroblastoma Protocol 2005: Therapy for Children with Advanced Stage High-Risk Neuroblastoma">{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT00135135?intr=%22Tazarotene%22&show_desc=Y#desc |title=Neuroblastoma Protocol 2005: Therapy for Children with Advanced Stage High-Risk Neuroblastoma |accessdate=2008-02-02 |work=}}</ref> Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York offers treatment that includes a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody, [[3F8]], used in protocols since the mid-1980s.

===Refractory and relapsed neuroblastoma===
[[File:BiggeggSH-SY5Y.jpg|thumb|microscopic view of a NB cell line (SH-SY5Y) used in preclinical research for testing new agents]]

Some children (particularly in high-risk cases) do not respond completely to frontline treatment (with a complete response or very good partial response) and are labeled refractory. These children are removed from the frontline therapy (clinical trial) and are eligible for clinical trials using new therapies. Many high-risk children have a good response to frontline therapy and achieve a remission, but later the disease recurs (relapse). These children are also eligible for new therapies being tested in clinical trials. 

Chemotherapy with topotecan and cyclophosphamide is frequently used in refractory setting and after relapse. A randomized study (2004) with 119 patients (comparing topotecan alone to topotecan and cyclophosphamide) revealed a 31% complete or partial response rate with two-year progression-free survival at 36% in the topotecan and cyclophosphamide group.<ref name="titleRecurrent neuroblastoma: Randomized treatment with topotecan + cyclophosphamide (T+C) vs. topotecan alone(T).

Many phase I and phase II trials are currently testing new agents against neuroblastoma in children who have relapsed or are resistant to initial therapy. Investigators are currently studying new agents, alone and in new combinations, using small molecule [[targeted therapy]], 131-I MIBG radiation therapy, [[angiogenesis]] agents, new [[monoclonal antibodies]], vaccines, oncolytic viruses, as well as new myeloablative regimens.
  
A group of 16 children's hospitals in the United States known as the New Advances in Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) consortium coordinates the I-131 MIBG radiation therapy trials.  The NANT consortium also offers trials using an oral powder formulation of [[fenretinide]], [[intravenous]] fenretinide, [[bisphosphonate]] (Zometa) with other agents, and combining I-131 MIBG with the inhibitor [[vorinostat]].<ref name="titleNANT Home Page">{{cite web |url=http://www.nant.org/ |title=NANT Home Page |accessdate=2008-02-02 |work=}}</ref>

Other research study groups such as The Neuroblastoma and Medulloblastoma Translational Research Consortium (NMTRC) also conduct clinical trials to treat relapse neuroblastoma.<ref name="urlHome - Neuroblastoma and Medulloblastoma Translational Research Consortium">{{cite web |url=http://www.nmtrc.org/ |title=Home - Neuroblastoma and Medulloblastoma Translational Research Consortium |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Institutions in Europe are studying novel therapies to treat relapse, including haploidentical stem cell transplant.<ref name="urlHaploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation in Neuroblastoma - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov">{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00790413 |title=Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation in Neuroblastoma - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Many hospitals conduct their own institutional studies as well.
  
The protein [[p53 (protein)|p53]] is believed to play a role in the development of resistance to chemotherapy.<ref name="pmid17974978">{{cite journal |author=Xue C, Haber M, Flemming C, ''et al.'' |title=p53 determines multidrug sensitivity of childhood neuroblastoma |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=67 |issue=21 |pages=10351–60 |year=2007 |pmid=17974978 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4345 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17974978}}</ref> A November 2009 study in mice shows that activating the tumor suppressor p53 with a new drug, nutlin-3, may slow tumor growth.<ref name="pmid19903807">{{cite journal |author=Van Maerken T, Ferdinande L, Taildeman J, ''et al.'' |title=Antitumor Activity of the Selective MDM2 Antagonist Nutlin-3 Against Chemoresistant Neuroblastoma With Wild-Type p53 |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=101 |issue=22 |pages=1562–1574 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19903807 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djp355 |url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19903807}}</ref> In this study, physician Tom Van Maerken of Ghent University Hospital in Belgium and his colleagues used nutlin-3 to neutralize MDM2, a protein that binds to the p53 protein and obstructs p53's ability to trigger programmed cell death. Earlier studies have shown that nutlin-3 can specifically prevent MDM2 from disabling p53.

==Legislative efforts==
[[U.S. Representative]] [[Chet Edwards]] of [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Texas]], successfully introduced legislation to earmark $150 million toward a cure for neuroblastoma and other cancers. The measure was signed into law in July 2008 by [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]. Edwards was inspired in the endeavor by the illness and subsequent death of Erin Channing Buenger (1997–2009) of [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]], daughter of one of his constituents, [[Walter L. Buenger]], head of the history department at [[Texas A&M University]].<ref name=eagle>{{cite web|url=http://www.theeagle.com/editorial/Erin-Buenger-had-a-zest-for-living-life-fully|title=Erin Buenger had a zest for living life fully, April 12, 2010|publisher=''Bryan-College Station Eagle''|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref>
