'''Terence John Hamblin''' (12 March 1943 – 8 January 2012) was professor of [[Immunohaematology]] at the [[University of Southampton]], [[United Kingdom]] since 1987. Born in [[Worcester, England]], he was educated at the [[University of Bristol]]. 

He was appointed as Consultant Haematologist in Bournemouth in 1974. He pursued a research career in [[haematology]] and [[immunology]], successively becoming an expert in [[plasma exchange]], [[stem cell]] transplantation, [[monoclonal antibody]] therapy, [[myelodysplastic syndrome]] and [[chronic lymphocytic leukaemia]]. He was awarded [[Guernsey Fellowship]] for stem cell transplantation in 1986 and the Binet-Rai Medal for outstanding research in CLL in 2002.

He was a prolific author of books, chapters, original peer-reviewed articles, reviews, editorials, and web articles on scientific and medical topics. He was editor of the scientific journal ''Leukemia Research'' (1986-) and a columnist for the comic/medical political magazine ''World Medicine'' (1976–84).

His most important research discovery was that chronic lymphocytic leukaemia comes in two forms, depending on whether the [[immunoglobulin]] heavy chain [[variable region genes]] contain [[somatic mutation]]s. If they do the survival of the patient averages 25 years; if they do not, the survival of the patient averages 8 years. 

Hamblin publicized the fact that, contrary to popular belief, [[spinach]] contains no more [[iron]] than [[lettuce]], while pink succulent [[lobster]] contains none at all; like all [[invertebrate]]s its [[respiratory pigment]] is based on [[copper]] rather than iron. He claimed in a 1981 ''[[BMJ]]'' paper that the belief in spinach having a high iron content was due to a decimal point error that was discovered in the 1930s;<ref>Hamblin, T.J.(1981) [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pdf_extract/283/6307/1671 Fake!] ''British Medical Journal'' Vol. 283.19–26 December. pp.1671-1674</ref> [[Mike Sutton (criminologist)|Mike Sutton]] published an article in 2010 questioning Hamblin's story.<ref>Sutton, M. (2010) [http://www.internetjournalofcriminology.com/Sutton_Spinach_Iron_and_Popeye_March_2010.pdf Spinach Iron and Popeye: Ironic lessons from biochemistry and history on the importance of healthy eating, healthy scepticism and adequate citation]. ''Internet Journal of Criminology''</ref> In a later article, Sutton discovered that, contrary to popular belief, Hamblin was not the original source of the spinach, Popeye, decimal error myth.<ref>http://www.bestthinking.com/articles/science/chemistry/biochemistry/the-spinach-popeye-iron-decimal-error-myth-is-finally-busted</ref> Hamblin died in 2012 of cancer.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/medicine-obituaries/9036815/Terry-Hamblin.html Terry Hamblin</ref>
