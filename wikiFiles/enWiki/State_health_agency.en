A '''state health agency''' ('''SHA'''), or '''state department of health''', is a department or [[Government agency|agency]] of the [[state governments of the United States]] focused on [[public health]]. The state [[secretary of health]] is a constitutional or at times a statutory official in several states of the United States. The position is the chief executive official for the state's state health agency (or equivalent), chief administrative officer for the state's Board of Health (or equivalent), or both. 

== Responsibilities ==
State health departments have different names and responsibilities; in some states they are top-level administrative agencies, while in other states they are a division or bureau of another office. Health departments are usually responsible for [[public health]], including [[preventive medicine]], [[epidemiology]], [[vaccination]]s, [[environmental health]] (sometimes including [[Health inspector|health inspections]]), and the [[License|licensing]] of [[health care professional]]s; the collection and archiving of [[vital record]]s such as [[birth certificate|birth]] and [[death certificate]]s and sometimes [[Marriage certificate|marriage]] and [[divorce]] certificates; health statistics; [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]]; [[mental health]]; [[occupational safety and health]]; receiving and recording reports of [[notifiable disease]]s; and [[tobacco]] control.

In some states, state health departments may additionally be responsible for [[social services]] and [[welfare]], [[environmental protection]]/[[pollution control]], or the operation of the state [[psychiatric hospital]]. Some states have a [[State Surgeon General|Surgeon General]].
