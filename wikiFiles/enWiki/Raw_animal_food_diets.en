Foods included in '''raw animal food diets''' include any food that can be eaten raw, so including raw, unprocessed  meats/organ-meats/raw eggs, raw dairy, and aged, raw animal foods such as [[century eggs]], rotting ([[Fermentation (food)|fermenting]]) meat/fish/shellfish/[[kefir]], as well as, to a lesser extent,  nuts/sprouts/plants/fruits, but generally not raw grains, raw beans, raw soy etc., because of [[digestibility]] and [[toxicity]] issues and also because [[Paleolithic diet|paleolists]] tend to reject [[neolithic]] or [[domesticated]] foods. Raw foods on such diets  have not been heated at temperatures above {{convert|104|°F|°C}}. “Raw Animal Foodists” believe that foods cooked above this temperature have lost much of their nutritional value and are harmful to the body<ref>http://www.life-enthusiast.com/index/Articles/Vonderplanitz/Recipe_for_Living_Without_Disease</ref>
Smoked meats are frowned upon by many Raw-Omnivores.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NAH/is_2_38/ai_n24220152 | work=Natural Health | title=Model of health: as a supermodel, Carol Alt says she was often run-down. Then she switched to a raw diet and regained her energy | year=2008}}</ref> Some make a distinction between hot-smoked and cold-smoked.

Those who eat a raw omnivorous diet usually choose to obtain their meats from free-range and grass-fed sources, to avoid harmful [[bacteria]].{{Dubious|date=June 2010}} A study by Cornell University<ref name=Russell>{{cite journal |author=Russell JB, Diez-Gonzalez F, Jarvis GN |title=Potential effect of cattle diets on the transmission of pathogenic Escherichia coli to humans |journal=Microbes Infect. |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=45–53 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10717540 |doi= 10.1016/S1286-4579(00)00286-0|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1286-4579(00)00286-0}}</ref> has determined that grass-fed animals have far fewer ''[[E. coli]]'' (about 1/300th) than their grain fed counterparts. Also in the same study, the amount of ''E. coli'' they do have is much less likely to survive our first line defense against infection, [[gastric acid]].
Grass-fed meat also has more nutrients, such as [[vitamins]], minerals, and [[omega-3 fatty acids]], than grain-finished meat<ref name=Russell/><ref>http://www.csuchico.edu/agr/grassfedbeef/health-benefits/index.html</ref><ref>http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/01681605/2001/00000066/00000001/art00492</ref><ref>ref> Tony Scott Klopfenstein, T., ''et al.''. '' 2000 Nebraska Beef Report'',:39-41 PFD at eatwild.com</ref>
Other studies show that ''E. coli'' O157:H7, ''Campylobacter'', ''Salmonella'', and other dangerous pathogens have been repeatedly isolated from both grass-fed and grain-fed livestock and there are conflicting results regarding whether the levels of pathogens are higher, lower, or the same when animals are fed grass- or grain-based diets.<ref>http://www.marlerblog.com/2008/08/articles/lawyer-oped/grassfed-vs-grainfed-beef-and-the-holy-grail-a-literature-review/</ref>

Examples of raw animal food diets include the Primal Diet and the Raw, [[Palaeolithic diet]] and the Tiger Diet.

The Primal Diet,<ref>[http://meatalovestory.com/excerpt.html Meat: A Love Story]</ref><ref>http://www.vueweekly.com/article.php?id=7032</ref> is a diet consisting of
fatty meats, organ meats, dairy, honey, minimal fruit and vegetable juices and coconut cream, all raw. The founder of the Primal Diet is Aajonus Vonderplanitz, a resident of Malibu, California. It has been estimated by Aajonus Vonderplanitz that there are 20,000 followers of his raw-meat-heavy Primal Diet in North America, alone.<ref>http://meatalovestory.com/excerpt.html</ref> Books by Aajonus Vonderplanitz, the Primal Diet author, include "The Recipe for Living Without Disease"<ref>http://www.amazon.com/Recipe-Living-Without-Disease/dp/1889356840</ref> and his book "We Want To Live - 2005 edition<ref>Vonderplanitz/dp/1889356107/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1220186322&sr=1-1</ref>

The [[Nenet]] tribe of Siberia eat a traditional diet consisting of mostly raw meats/organ-meats and raw berries.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/13/AR2008051300583.html?sid=ST2008051302252 | work=The Washington Post | title=Where Home Cooking Gets the Cold Shoulder | first=Andreas | last=Viestad | date=2008-05-14 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

Those [[Inuit]] people that still follow their traditional diet eat a partially raw diet, including large amounts of raw meats/organ-meats and aged raw foods in the form of caribou and fish, among other foods.<ref>http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPNS%2FPNS12_01%2FS0029665153000188a.pdf&code=5de869c321f69f431e3a1a9fe14560df</ref>

[[Pemmican]] is the traditional North American travel food, prepared from dried meat, fat, and berries.

[[Gravlax]] (not [[smoked salmon]]) is the traditional (without [[sugar]]) Scandinavian way of preserving salmon.
