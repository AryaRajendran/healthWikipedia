'''HELLP syndrome''' is a life-threatening [[obstetric]] complication usually considered to be a variant or complication of [[pre-eclampsia]].<ref name="Haram-2009">{{Cite journal | author = Haram K, Svendsen E, Abildgaard U | title = The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management.

==Signs and symptoms==
HELLP usually begins during the third trimester; rare cases have been reported as early as 21 weeks gestation. Often, a patient who develops HELLP syndrome has already been followed up for [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] (''gestational hypertension''), or is suspected to develop [[pre-eclampsia]] (high blood pressure and [[proteinuria]]). Up to 8% of all cases present ''after'' delivery.

Women with HELLP syndrome often "do not look very sick."<ref name="Weinstein-2005">{{Cite journal  | author = Weinstein L | title = It has been a great ride: the history of HELLP syndrome | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 193 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = 860–3 | month = Sep | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2005.06.058 | PMID = 16150288 }}</ref> Early symptoms can include:
* In 90% of cases, either [[Epigastrium|epigastric]] pain described as "heartburn" or [[Right upper quadrant (abdomen)|right upper quadrant]] pain.<ref name="Weinstein-2005"/><ref name="Sibai-1990">{{Cite journal  | author = Sibai BM| title = The HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets): much ado about nothing? | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 162 | issue = 2 | pages = 311–6 | month = Feb | year = 1990 | PMID = 2309811 }}</ref>
* In 90% of cases, [[malaise]].<ref name="Sibai-1990"/>
* In 50% of cases, nausea or vomiting.<ref name="Sibai-1990"/>

There can be gradual but marked onset of [[headache]]s (30%), blurred vision, and [[paresthesia]] (tingling in the extremities). [[Edema]] may occur but its absence does not exclude HELLP syndrome. [[Arterial hypertension]] is a diagnostic requirement, but may be mild. Rupture of the liver capsule and a resultant [[hematoma]] may occur. If the patient has a [[seizure]] or [[coma]], the condition has progressed into full-blown [[eclampsia]].

[[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]] is also seen in about 20% of all women with HELLP syndrome,<ref name="Sibai-1993b">{{cite journal |author=Sibai BM, Ramadan MK, Usta I, Salama M, Mercer BM, Friedman SA |title=Maternal morbidity and mortality in 442 pregnancies with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP syndrome) |journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol |volume=169 |issue=4 |pages=1000–6 |year=1993 |month=October |pmid=8238109 |doi= |url=}}</ref> and in 84% when HELLP is complicated by [[acute renal failure]].<ref name="Sibai-1993a">{{Cite journal | author = Sibai BM, Ramadan MK | title = Acute renal failure in pregnancies complicated by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 168 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = 1682–7; discussion 1687–90 | month = Jun | year = 1993 | doi =  | PMID = 8317509 }}</ref>  [[Pulmonary edema]] is found in 6% of all women with HELLP syndrome,<ref name="Sibai-1993b"/> and in 44% when HELLP is complicated by acute renal failure.<ref name="Sibai-1993a"/>

Patients who present with symptoms of HELLP can be misdiagnosed in the early stages, increasing the risk of liver failure and morbidity.<ref name="Padden-1999">{{cite journal |author=Padden MO |title=HELLP syndrome: recognition and perinatal management | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 829–36, 839 | month = Sep | year = 1999 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/0901/p829.html | PMID = 10498110 }}</ref> Rarely, post caesarean patients may present in shock condition mimicking either [[pulmonary embolism]] or reactionary haemorrhage.

==Pathophysiology==
The exact cause of HELLP is unknown, but general activation of the coagulation cascade is considered the main underlying problem. Fibrin forms crosslinked networks in the small [[blood vessel]]s. This leads to a [[microangiopathic hemolytic anemia]]: the mesh causes destruction of [[red blood cell]]s as if they were being forced through a strainer. Additionally, [[platelet]]s are consumed. As the [[liver]] appears to be the main site of this process, downstream liver cells suffer [[ischemia]], leading to periportal necrosis. Other organs can be similarly affected. HELLP syndrome leads to a variant form of [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC), leading to paradoxical [[hemorrhage|bleeding]], which can make emergency surgery a challenge.

==Diagnosis and classification==
HELLP syndrome can be difficult to diagnose due to the variability of symptoms among patients (frequently patients have no symptoms other than general abdominal pain), and early diagnosis is key in reducing morbidity.  If not treated in a timely manner, a mother can become critically ill or die due to liver rupture/hemorrhage or cerebral edema.   

In a patient with possible HELLP syndrome, a batch of [[blood test]]s is performed: a [[full blood count]], a [[coagulation]] panel, [[liver enzyme]]s, [[electrolyte]]s, and [[renal function]] studies. Often, ''[[fibrin degradation product]]'' (FDP) levels are determined, which can be elevated. [[Lactate dehydrogenase]] is a marker of hemolysis and is elevated (> 600 U/liter). [[Proteinuria]] is present but can be mild.

In one 1995 study, a positive [[D-dimer]] test in the presence of preeclampsia was reported to be predictive of patients who will develop HELLP syndrome.<ref name="Padden-1999"/><ref name="Neiger-1995">{{Cite journal  | author = Neiger R, Trofatter MO, Trofatter KF Jr | title = D-dimer test for early detection of HELLP syndrome | journal = South Med J | volume = 88 | issue = 4 | pages = 416–9 | month = Apr | year = 1995 | doi =  | PMID = 7716593 }}</ref>

The diagnostic criteria for and subtypes of HELLP vary across studies, which "makes comparison of published data difficult."<ref name="Haram-2009"/>  The classifications include:
* Criteria developed at the [[University of Tennessee]]:<ref name="Sibai-1990"/><ref name="Audibert-1996">{{Cite journal  | author = Audibert F, Friedman SA, Frangieh AY, Sibai BM | title = Clinical utility of strict diagnostic criteria for the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 175 | issue = 2 | pages = 460–4 | month = Aug | year = 1996 | PMID = 8765269 }}</ref>
** HELLP is characterized by hemolysis on [[peripheral blood smear]] with serum [[lactate dehydrogenase]] >600 IU/L; serum [[aspartate aminotransferase]] >70 IU/L; and platelet count <100,000/μL.
** Partial HELLP syndrome is characterized by 1-2 features of HELLP.
* Criteria developed at the [[University of Mississippi]], as of 1999:<ref name="Martin-1999">{{Cite journal  | author = Martin JN Jr, Rinehart BK, May WL, Magann EF, Terrone DA, Blake PG | title = The spectrum of severe preeclampsia: comparative analysis by HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet count) syndrome classification | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 180 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = 1373–84 | month = Jun | year = 1999 | doi =  | PMID = 10368474 }}</ref>
** "The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome required the presence of thrombocytopenia (perinatal platelet nadir ≤150,000 cells/μL), evidence of hepatic dysfunction (increased aspartate aminotransferase level of ≥40 IU/L, increased alanine aminotransferase level of ≥40 IU/L, or both, with increased lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] level of ≥600 IU/L), and evidence of hemolysis (increased LDH level, progressive anemia)...."
** "Class 1 HELLP syndrome featured severe thrombocytopenia with a platelet nadir of ≤50,000 cells/μL, class 2 HELLP syndrome featured moderate thrombocytopenia with a platelet nadir between >50,000 and ≤100,000 cells/μL, and class 3 HELLP syndrome featured mild thrombocytopenia with a platelet nadir between >100,000 and ≤150,000 cells/μL."
* Criteria developed at the [[University of Mississippi]], as of 2006: "For a patient to merit a diagnosis of HELLP syndrome, class 1 requires severe thrombocytopenia (platelets ≤50,000/μL), evidence of hepatic dysfunction (AST [aspartate aminotransferase] and/or ALT [alanine aminotransferase] ≥70 IU/L), and evidence suggestive of hemolysis (total serum LDH ≥600 IU/L); class 2 requires similar criteria except thrombocytopenia is moderate (>50,000 to ≤100,000/μL); and class 3 includes patients with mild thrombocytopenia (platelets >100,000 but ≤150,000/μL), mild hepatic dysfunction (AST and/or ALT ≥40 IU/L), and hemolysis (total serum LDH ≥600 IU/L)."<ref name="Martin-2006">{{Cite journal | author = Martin JN Jr, Rose CH, Briery CM | title = Understanding and managing HELLP syndrome: the integral role of aggressive glucocorticoids for mother and child | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 195 | issue = 4 | pages = 914–34 | month = Oct | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2005.08.044 | PMID = 16631593 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
The only effective treatment is prompt delivery of the baby. Several medications have been investigated for the treatment of HELLP syndrome, but evidence is conflicting as to whether [[magnesium sulfate]] decreases the risk of seizures and progress to eclampsia. The [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation|DIC]] is treated with [[fresh frozen plasma]] to replenish the coagulation proteins, and the [[anemia]] may require [[blood transfusion]]. In mild cases, [[corticosteroid]]s and [[antihypertensive]]s ([[labetalol]], [[hydralazine]], [[nifedipine]]) may be sufficient. Intravenous fluids are generally required.  Hepatic hemorrhage can be treated with embolization as well if life-threatening bleeding ensues.

The University of Mississippi standard protocol for HELLP includes corticosteroids.<ref name="Martin-2012">{{Cite journal  | author = Martin JN, Owens MY, Keiser SD, Parrish MR, Tam Tam KB, Brewer JM, Cushman JL, May WL | title = Standardized Mississippi Protocol treatment of 190 patients with HELLP syndrome: slowing disease progression and preventing new major maternal morbidity | journal = Hypertens Pregnancy | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–90 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.3109/10641955.2010.525277 | PMID = 21219123 }}</ref> However, a 2009 review found "no conclusive evidence" supporting corticosteroid therapy,<ref name="Haram-2009"/> and a 2010 [[systematic review]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] also found "no clear evidence of any effect of corticosteroids on substantive clinical outcomes" either for the mothers or for the newborns,<ref name="Woudstra-2010">{{Cite journal  | author = Woudstra DM, Chandra S, Hofmeyr GJ, Dowswell T| title = Corticosteroids for HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome in pregnancy | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume =  | issue = 9 | pages = CD008148 | month =  | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008148.pub2 | PMID = 20824872 }}</ref>

==Prognosis==
With treatment, maternal mortality is about 1 percent, although complications such as [[placental abruption]], [[acute renal failure]], subcapsular liver hematoma, permanent liver damage, and [[retinal detachment]] occur in about 25% of women.<ref name="Sibai-1993b"/> Perinatal mortality (stillbirths plus death in infancy) is between 73 and 119 per 1000 babies of HELLP patients, while up to 40% are [[small for gestational age]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Hypertension in Pregnancy |last=Belfort |first=Michael A. |authorlink= |coauthors=Steven Thornton, George R.

==Epidemiology==
Its incidence is reported as 0.5-0.9% of all pregnancies, and 10-20% of women with severe preeclampsia.<ref name="Haram-2009"/> HELLP usually occurs in Caucasian women over the age of 25.<ref name="Padden-1999"/>

==History==
HELLP syndrome was identified as a distinct clinical entity (as opposed to severe pre-eclampsia) by Dr. Louis Weinstein in 1982.<ref name="Weinstein-1982"/> In a 2005 article, Weinstein wrote that the unexplained postpartum death of a woman who had hemolysis, abnormal liver function, thrombocytopenia, and hypoglycemia motivated him to review the medical literature and to compile information on similar patients.<ref name="Weinstein-2005"/> He noted that cases with features of HELLP had been reported as early as 1954.<ref name="Weinstein-2005"/><ref name="Pritchard-1954">{{Cite journal | author = Pritchard JA, Weisman R Jr, Ratnoff OD, Vosburgh GJ | title = Intravascular hemolysis, thrombocytopenia and other hematologic abnormalities associated with severe toxemia of pregnancy | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 250 | issue = 3 | pages = 89–98 | month = Jan | year = 1954 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM195401212500301 | PMID = 13119851 }}</ref>
