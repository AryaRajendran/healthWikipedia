A [[gastrointestinal]] infection that may or may not be [[symptomatic]] and can remain [[Incubation period|latent]] in an infected person for several years, amoebiasis is estimated to cause 70,000 deaths per year world wide.<ref>{{cite book|author=WHO|title=Life in the 21st Century: a vision for all. The World Health Report 1998. |year=1998| publisher=World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland}}</ref> Symptoms can range from mild [[diarrhea]] to [[dysentery]] with [[blood]] and [[mucus]] in the stool. ''E. histolytica'' is usually a [[Commensalism|commensal]] organism.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Haque R, Mondal D, Duggal P, ''et al.'' | title=''Entamoeba histolytica'' infection in children and protection from subsequent amebiasis| journal=Infection & Immunity | year=2006 | volume=74 | issue=2 | pages=904&ndash;909 | doi=10.1128/IAI.74.2.904-909.2006 | pmid=16428733 | pmc=1360358}}</ref> Severe amoebiasis infections (known as invasive or ''fulminant'' amoebiasis) occur in two major forms. Invasion of the intestinal lining causes [[amoebic dysentery]] or [[amoebic colitis]]. If the parasite reaches the bloodstream it can spread through the body, most frequently ending up in the liver where it causes [[amoebic liver abscesses]].  [[Liver]] abscesses can occur without previous development of amoebic dysentery. When no symptoms are present, the infected individual is still a carrier, able to spread the parasite to others through poor hygienic practices. While symptoms at onset can be similar to [[Dysentery#Bacillary dysentery|bacillary dysentery]], amoebiasis is not bacteriological in origin and treatments differ, although both infections can be  prevented by good sanitary practices.

== Transmission ==

Amoebiasis is usually transmitted by the [[fecal-oral route]], but it can also be transmitted indirectly through contact with dirty hands or objects as well as by [[anal-oral contact]]. Infection is spread through ingestion of the [[cyst]] form of the [[parasite]], a semi-dormant and hardy structure found in [[feces]]. Any non-encysted amoebae, or ''trophozoites'', die quickly after leaving the body but may also be present in stool: these are rarely the source of new infections. Since amoebiasis is transmitted through contaminated food and water, it is often endemic in regions of the world with limited modern [[sanitation]] systems, including México, Central America, western [[South America]], [[South Asia]], and western and southern [[Africa]].<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | pages=733–8 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9}}</ref>

Amoebic dysentery is often confused with "traveler's diarrhea" because of its prevalence in developing nations. In fact, most traveler's diarrhea is bacterial or viral in origin.

== Prevention ==
[[File:Amoebic Ulcer Intestine.jpg|thumb|Amoebic Ulcer Intestine]]
To help prevent the spread of amoebiasis around the home :

* [[hand washing|Wash hands]] thoroughly with soap and hot running water for at least 10 seconds after using the [[toilet]] or [[diaper#Changing|changing a baby's diaper]], and before handling food.
* Clean [[bathroom]]s and [[toilet]]s often; pay particular attention to [[toilet seat]]s and taps.
* Avoid sharing [[towel]]s or face washers.

To help prevent infection:

* Avoid raw vegetables when in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas, as they may have been fertilized using human feces.
* Boil water or treat with [[iodine]] tablets.
* Avoid eating street foods especially in public places where others are sharing sauces in one container

Good sanitary practice, as well as responsible sewage disposal or treatment, are necessary for the prevention of ''E.histolytica'' infection on an endemic level.  ''E.histolytica'' cysts are usually resistant to chlorination, therefore sedimentation and filtration of water supplies are necessary to reduce the incidence of infection.<ref>Brock Biology of Microorganisms; Madigan (et al.); Pearson Education Inc., 2003; pgg. 947-948</ref>

== Nature of the disease ==

Most infected people, about 90%,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra022710 |title=Amebiasis |work=[[NEJM]] |publisher=United States [[NEJM]]: Massachusetts Medical Society |date=2003-04-17 |accessdate=2012-04-12}}</ref> are [[asymptomatic]], but this disease has the potential to make the sufferer dangerously ill. It is estimated that about 40,000 to 100,000 people worldwide die annually due to amoebiasis.<ref>Atlas of Human Infectious Diseases, First Edition. Heiman F.L. Wertheim, Peter Horby and John P. Woodall., 2012, Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</ref>

Infections can sometimes last for years. Symptoms take from a few days to a few weeks to develop and manifest themselves, but usually it is about two to four weeks. Symptoms can range from mild [[diarrhoea]] to [[dysentery]] with [[blood]] and [[mucus]]. The blood comes from amoebae invading the lining of the [[intestine]]. In about 10% of invasive cases the amoebae enter the bloodstream and may travel to other organs in the body. Most commonly this means the [[liver]], as this is where blood from the intestine reaches first, but they can end up almost anywhere.

Onset time is highly variable and the average asymptomatic infection persists for over a year. It is theorised that the absence of symptoms or their intensity may vary with such factors as strain of amoeba, immune response of the host, and perhaps associated [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es.

In asymptomatic infections the amoeba lives by eating and digesting bacteria and food particles in the gut, a part of the [[gastrointestinal tract]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} It does not usually come in contact with the intestine itself due to the protective layer of mucus that lines the gut. Disease occurs when amoeba comes in contact with the cells lining the intestine. It then secretes the same substances it uses to digest bacteria, which include [[enzyme]]s that destroy [[cell membrane]]s and [[protein]]s. This process can lead to penetration and digestion of human [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, resulting first in flask-shaped [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]] in the intestine. ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'' ingests the destroyed cells by [[phagocytosis]] and is often seen with [[red blood cells]] inside when viewed in stool samples.  Especially in [[Latin America]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} a [[granuloma]]tous mass (known as an [[amoeboma]]) may form in the wall of the [[Colon (anatomy)|ascending colon]] or [[rectum]] due to long-lasting [[Immune system|immunological]] cellular response, and is sometimes confused with [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Day|first=David W.|coauthors=Basil C. Morson, Jeremy R. Jass, Geraint Williams, Ashley B. Price|title=Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology|year=2003| publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.| isbn=978-0-632-04204-3}}</ref>

== Diagnosis of human illness ==
[[Image:Ehistdisp cyst wtmt.jpg|250px|right|thumb| Immature ''E. histolytica/E. dispar'' cyst in a concentrated wet mount stained with iodine. This early cyst has only one nucleus and a glycogen mass is visible (brown stain). From CDC’s Division of Parasitic Diseases]]
Asymptomatic human infections are usually diagnosed by finding cysts shed in the stool. Various [[flotation process|flotation]] or sedimentation procedures have been developed to recover the cysts from fecal matter and stains help to visualize the isolated cysts for microscopic examination. Since cysts are not shed constantly, a minimum of three stools should be examined. In symptomatic infections, the motile form (the trophozoite) can often be seen in fresh feces. [[serology|Serological]] tests exist  and most individuals (whether with symptoms or not) will test positive for the presence of [[antibody|antibodies]]. The levels of antibody are much higher in individuals with [[liver abscess]]es. Serology only becomes positive about two weeks after infection. More recent developments include a kit that detects the presence of amoeba proteins in the feces and another that detects ameba [[DNA]] in feces. These tests are not in widespread use due to their expense.

Microscopy is still by far the most widespread method of diagnosis around the world. However it is not as sensitive or accurate in diagnosis as the other tests available. It is important to distinguish the ''E. histolytica'' cyst from the cysts of nonpathogenic intestinal protozoa such as ''[[Entamoeba coli]]'' by its appearance.  ''E. histolytica'' cysts have a maximum of four nuclei, while the [[commensalism|commensal]] ''Entamoeba coli'' cyst has up to 8 nuclei.  Additionally, in ''E. histolytica,'' the [[endosome]] is centrally located in the nucleus, while it is usually off-center in ''Entamoeba coli.''  Finally, [[chromatoidal bodies]] in ''E. histolytica'' cysts are rounded, while they are jagged in ''Entamoeba coli''. However, other species, ''[[Entamoeba dispar]]'' and ''E. moshkovskii'', are also commensals and cannot be distinguished from ''E. histolytica'' under the microscope. As ''E. dispar'' is much more common than ''E. histolytica'' in most parts of the world this means that there is a lot of incorrect diagnosis of ''E. histolytica'' infection taking place. The WHO recommends that infections diagnosed by microscopy alone should not be treated if they are asymptomatic and there is no other reason to suspect that the infection is actually ''E. histolytica''.

Typically, the organism can no longer be found in the feces once the disease goes extra-intestinal.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Serological tests are useful in detecting infection by ''E. histolytica'' if the organism goes extra-intestinal and in excluding the organism from the diagnosis of other disorders. An Ova & Parasite (O&P) test or an ''E. histolytica'' fecal antigen assay is the proper assay for intestinal infections. Since antibodies may persist for years after clinical cure, a positive serological result may not necessarily indicate an active infection. A negative serological result however can be equally important in excluding suspected tissue invasion by ''E. histolytica''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

== Relative frequency of the disease ==

In older textbooks it is often stated that 10% of the world's population is infected with ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} It is now known that at least 90% of these infections are due to ''E. dispar''. Nevertheless, this means that there are up to 50 million true ''E. histolytica'' infections and approximately seventy thousand die each year, mostly from liver abscesses or other complications.  Although usually considered a tropical parasite, the first case reported (in 1875) was actually in St Petersburg in Russia, near the Arctic Circle.<ref>Lösch, F. (1875) Massenhafte Entwickelung von Amöben im Dickdarm. Virchow's Archiv 65: 196-211.</ref> Infection is more common in warmer areas, but this is both because of poorer hygiene and the parasitic cysts surviving longer in warm moist conditions.<ref name=Sherris/>

== Treatment ==
{{main|Amoebicide}}
''E. histolytica'' infections occur in both the intestine and (in people with symptoms) in tissue of the intestine and/or liver.<ref name=Sherris/> As a result, two different classes of drugs are needed to treat the infection, one for each location. Such anti-amoebic drugs are known as [[amoebicide]]s.

== Complications ==

In the majority of cases, amoebas remain in the gastrointestinal tract of the hosts. Severe ulceration of the gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces occurs in less than 16% of cases. In fewer cases, the parasite invades the soft tissues, most commonly the liver. Only rarely are masses formed (amoebomas) that lead to intestinal obstruction.(Mistaken for Ca caecum and appendicular mass) Other local complications include bloody diarrhea, pericolic and pericaecal abscess.

Complications of hepatic amoebiasis includes subdiaphragmatic abscess, perforation of diaphgram to pericardium and pleural cavity, perforation to abdominal cavital ''(amoebic peritonitis)'' and perforation of skin ''(amoebic cutis)''.

Pulmonary amoebiasis can occur from hepatic lesion by haemotagenous spread and also by perforation of pleural cavity and lung. It can cause lung abscess, pulmono pleural fistula, empyema lung and broncho pleural fistula. It can also reach brain through blood vessel and cause amoebic brain abscess and amoebic meningoencephalitis. Cutaneous amoebiasis can also occur skin around site of colostomy wound, perianal region, region overlying visceral lesion and at the site of drainage of liver abscess.

Urogenital tract amoebiasis derived from intestinal lesion can cause amoebic vulvovaginitis ''(May's disease)'', rectovesicle fistula and rectovaginal fistula.

''Entamoeba histolytica'' infection is associated with malnutrition and stunting of growth.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Mondal D, Petri Jr WA, Sack RB, ''et al.'' | title=''Entamoeba histolytica''-associated diarreal illness is negatively associated with the growth of preschool shildren: evidence from a  prospective study | journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med H | year=2006 | volume=100 | issue=11 | pages=1032&ndash;38 | doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.12.012 | pmid=16730764 }}</ref>

== Food analysis ==

''E. histolytica'' cysts may be recovered from contaminated food by methods similar to those used for recovering ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' cysts from feces. Filtration is probably the most practical method for recovery from drinking water and liquid foods. ''E. histolytica'' cysts must be distinguished from cysts of other parasitic (but nonpathogenic) protozoa and from cysts of free-living protozoa as discussed above. Recovery procedures are not very accurate; cysts are easily lost or damaged beyond recognition, which leads to many falsely negative results in recovery tests.<ref>{{cite web | title = FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual | url = http://www.foodinfonet.com/publication/fdaBAM.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080406032216/http://www.foodinfonet.com/publication/fdaBAM.htm| archivedate= 6 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

== Outbreaks ==

The most dramatic incident in the USA was the [[Century of Progress|Chicago World's Fair]] outbreak in 1933 caused by contaminated drinking water; defective plumbing permitted sewage to contaminate water.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Markell EK |title=The 1933 Chicago outbreak of amebiasis |journal=West.
