'''Retinal hemorrhage''' is a disorder of the [[human eye|eye]] in which bleeding occurs into the retensitive tissue on the back wall of the eye. A retinal hemorrhage can be caused by [[hypertension]], [[retinal vein occlusion]] (a blockage of a retinal vein), or [[diabetes mellitus]] (which causes small fragile blood vessels to form, which are easily damaged). Retinal hemorrhages can also occur due to shaking, particularly in young [[infant]]s ([[shaken baby syndrome]]) or from severe blows to the head.

Retinal hemorrhages that take place outside of the [[macula]] can go undetected for many years, and may sometimes only be picked up when the eye is examined in detail by [[ophthalmoscopy]] or [[fundus photography]]. However, some retinal hemorrhages can cause severe impairment of vision.

==Diagnosis==
A retinal hemorrhage is generally diagnosed by using an ophthalmoscope or fundus camera in order to examine the inside of the eye.  A fluorescent dye is often injected into the patient's bloodstream beforehand so the administering ophthalmologist can have a more detailed view of the blood vessels in the retina.<ref>http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Retinal+hemorrhage</ref>

==Treatment==
Retinal hemorrhages, especially mild ones not associated with chronic disease, will normally resorb without treatment.  Laser surgery is a treatment option which uses a laser beam to seal off damaged blood vessels in the retina.<ref>http://www.laretinasurgeon.com/retinal-bleeding.aspx</ref>  Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs like Avastin and Lucentis have also been shown to repair retinal hemorrhaging in diabetic patients and patients with hemorrhages associated with new vessel growth.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16508426</ref><ref>http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/macular-degeneration/anti-vegf-medicines-for-wet-age-related-macular-degeneration-amd</ref>
