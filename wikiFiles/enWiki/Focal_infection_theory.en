'''Focal infection theory''' (FIT) is the idea that a local infection affecting a small area of the body can lead to subsequent infections or symptoms in other parts of the body due either to the spread of the infectious agent itself or toxins produced from it.<ref>Stillman, Paul Roscoe (1922) A Textbook of clinical periodontia; Page 111</ref><ref name="CDA">Pallasch, Thomas J. DDS; MS, and Michael J. Wahl, DDS (2000) [http://www.cda.org/library/cda_member/pubs/journal/jour0300/focal.html "The Focal Infection Theory: Appraisal and Reappraisal"], ''Journal of the California Dental Association''</ref>

Early proponents of FIT variously listed infection in the tonsils, oral cavity, sinuses, prostate, appendix, bladder, gall bladder, and kidney as possible causes of systemic disease.  Many of these areas were targets of operations in an attempt to heal the entire body.  Opponents at the time criticized FIT as blaming systemic problems on "anything that is readily accessible to surgery."<ref name="CDA"/><ref>Cecil RL, Angevine DM, (1938) "Clinical and experimental observations on focal infection with an analysis of 200 cases of rheumatoid arthritis" ''Ann Int Med'' 12(5):577-84</ref>

The theory became popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, especially in the field of oral medicine.   Connecting disease to dental infections resulted in an extremely high number of [[dental extraction|pulled teeth]] during the 1920s.  Studies in the 1930s showed that previous evidence in support of this application were flawed, and more rigorous research did not find evidence for dental infections as a major source of systemic disease.

FIT was greatly refined over the 20th century to explain specific diseases such as tuberculosis, gonorrhea, syphilis, pneumonia, typhoid fever, and mumps, all of which do follow its general principle albeit in much narrower pathways than was originally suggested by the theory's early proponents.<ref>(1952) ''Southern California State Dental Association journal''; pg 27</ref>  

In the dental community, current consensus is that FIT is not a valid reason to remove teeth or to avoid [[root canal therapy]] as ways to cure systemic infections or prevent bacteria from spreading from the tooth to the body.  More recent studies have shown a relationship between dental health and heart disease, but these are only [[correlation]]al and do not support conclusions about the root cause.  At the same time the academic community has cautiously reinvestigated FIT, the [[natural health]] and [[holistic dentistry|holistic dentist]] communities have enthusiastically revived early research into FIT as the basis for a broad criticism of mainstream dental practices.  The academic community considers these critiques unsupported by both the early and more recent research into FIT.

==Primary cause of systemic disease era (1890s—1950s)==

The notion of removing the focus of infection to cure a systemic disease may go back as far as [[Hippocrates]], but the modern theory of focal infection can be traced back to the late 19th century amidst a growing interest in [[bacteriology]] and the work of [[Robert Koch]].<ref name="CDA">Thomas J. Pallasch, DDS, MS, and Michael J. Wahl, DDS (2000) [http://www.cda.org/library/cda_member/pubs/journal/jour0300/focal.html "The Focal Infection Theory: Appraisal and Reappraisal"], ''Journal of the California Dental Association''.</ref> In the 1890s, [[Willoughby D. Miller]], who worked in Koch's laboratory, proposed that oral microorganisms found in [[dental caries|cavities]] played a role in the [[etiology]] of [[pulmonary diseases]], gastric problems, and brain abscesses among other medical conditions.<ref name="Barnett">Michael L. Barnett, DDS  (2006) [http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/full/137/suppl_2/5S#R6 "The Oral-Systemic Disease Connection: An Update for the Practicing Dentist"], ''[[Journal of the American Dental Association]]''. Vol 137, No suppl_2, 5S-6S.</ref> He published his findings as "The Micro-Organisms of the Human Mouth: The Local and General Diseases Which Are Caused by Them" in Germany in 1890,<ref name="CDA"/><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=2zPeF6hAWIIC&ots=hW28S1neUO&dq=Willoughby%20Dayton%20Miller&pg=PP4#v=onepage&q&f=false Original German version] - Lane Medical Library</ref> and then in ''Dental Cosmos'' in 1891, in an article titled, "The Human Mouth as a Focus of Infection."<ref name="Barnett"/>  However, Miller did not recommend [[Dental extraction|extracting]] infected teeth and was a proponent of [[root canal therapy]].<ref name="CDA"/>

In 1900, William Hunter, a British physician, also claimed that poor dental health could cause several systemic diseases,<ref name="CDA"/>   In 1911, he gained wide attention to these theories by presenting them in a speech to the medical students of McGill University.<ref name="Barnett"/>  Hunter claimed that, "[t]he worst cases of [[anemia]], [[gastritis]], [[colitis]], obscure fevers, nervous disturbances of all kinds from [[Depression (mood)|mental depression]] to actual lesions of the cord, chronic rheumatic infections, [[kidney diseases]], are those which owe their origin to, or are gravely complicated by the oral [[sepsis]] produced by these gold traps of sepsis."<ref name="CDA"/>  In other words, according to Hunter, dental restorations were to blame.<ref name="Barnett"/> Hunter's American critics, however, pointed to the poor state of dental health in the United Kingdom and shifted the blame from the dental procedures themselves to their poor execution, an argument that eventually led to the removal of untrained dental practitioners by improving licensing requirements.<ref name="CDA"/>

Frank Billings formally introduced the focal infection theory to American physicians in 1912 with his lectures at Stanford University Medical School being published in 1916.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=h8o64tcq2PkC&ots=jXxFYt_mjn&dq=focal%20infection&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false Focal Infection] - by The Lane Medical Lectures</ref> Living at a time when sanitation was at its infancy and human contact diseases were prevalent, he believed that most infections were "filth diseases" and therefore preventable.  Billings went a step further than Hunter, and promoted [[tonsillectomies]] and [[dental extraction]]s as remedies for focal infections.<ref name="CDA"/>  Billings' theories lived on in his pupil, E.C. Rosenow who emphasized cooperation between dentists and physicians in curing these infections, and postulated that tooth extraction was often not enough on its own.<ref name="Barnett"/> When prominent doctors like [[Charles William Mayo|Charles Mayo]] and Russell Cecil joined ranks in promoting the theory and the surgical remedy, "millions of tonsils and teeth were removed in what was later described as an 'orgy of extractions.'"<ref name="CDA"/>

===Criticism, research, detraction, and decline===

Despite gaining mainstream support the focal infection theory had it detractors. 

Robert T Morris in a December 13, 1918, address to the Eastern Medical Society stated focal infection theory was already falling into disrepute in certain fields due to the other-enthusiasm of some of its advocates and stated that more evidence was needed before the medical profession continued taking active interest in the matter.<ref>Morris, Robert T (1919) "Address on Medicine and Surgery" ''American medicine'', Volume 25; University of Michigan pg 18-23</ref>

In the October 20–24, 1919, National Dental Association annual session, C. Edmund Kells presented a paper that was highly critical of the mass extractions and recommended that dentists refuse the instructions of physicians who recommend them.  When the presentation was printed in the 1920 ''Journal of the National Dental Association'' a dentist named Titeston praised Kells for his stance and went further saying the tooth extraction craze resulting from focal infection theory qualified as a fad.<ref>Kells, C. Edmund (1920) "X-ray in Dental Practice" , ''Journal of the National Dental Association'' Volume 7; Number 3; pgs 241-272</ref>

However in 1923, [[Weston Price]], chairman of the Research Section of the American Dental Association, published the two volume set ''Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic'' in full support of FIT.  Regarding how FIT was being applied Price also noted that he was continually seeing patients "suffering more from the inconvenience and difficulties of mastication and nourishment than they did from the lesions from which their physician or dentist had sought to give them relief" a view that a 1935 ''Journal of the Canadian Dental Association'' article author would cite as an example of 'the authorities that emphasize my contentions for conservatism' (even as he called Price "radical")<ref>(1935) ''Journal of the Canadian Dental Association'' volume 1; pg 451</ref>  Despite this and Price's later 1925 "Dental Infections and related Degenerative Diseases" work being criticized for "faulty bacterial technique"<ref>Crowe, Henry Warren; Herbert George Franking (1927) ''Bacteriology & surgery of chronic arthritis and rheumatism'' "Etiology Continued : Dental Infections And Degenerative Diseases - A Review And Commentary" Oxford university press pg 23-32</ref> ''Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic'' fit so well into the existing thought of the day that it would be used as a reference in textbooks and diagnosis guides clear into the early to mid-1930s.<ref>Hayes, Louis Vincent (1935) "Clinical diagnosis of diseases of the mouth: a guide for students and practitioners of dentistry and medicine" pg 389</ref><ref>McGehee, William Harper Owen (1930, 1936) "A text-book of operative dentistry" Page 39, pg 110</ref>

In 1938, a former proponent of the theory, Russell Cecil stated that "focal infection is a splendid example of a plausible medical theory which is in danger of being converted by its enthusiastic supporters into the status of an accepted fact."<ref name="CDA"/>  Cecil published the findings from a study of 200 cases of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] documenting no curative benefit of tonsillectomies or dental extractions. 

In 1940, H.A. Reimann and W.P. Havens, published what was perhaps "the most influential critique of the focal infection theory", showing that it was completely unproven.<ref name="CDA"/>

By 1950 focal infection theory had fallen from its status as the primary cause of systemic disease<ref>Jaypee Brothers, Medical Publishers (2009) ''Essentials of clinical periodontology and periodontics'' pg 116</ref> and a special 1951 issue of the ''Journal of the American Dental Association'' stated: "Many Authorities who formally felt that focal infection was an important etiologic factor in systemic disease have become skeptical and now recommend less radical procedures in the treatment of such disorders." <ref>"An Evaluation of the Effect of Dental Focal Infection on Health" JADA 42:609-697 June 1951</ref>  

According to a 2000 ''Journal of the California Dental Association'' article by Pallasch, the general application of focal infection theory fell out of scientific favor due to improved dental care, advent of antibiotics, the small percent of "cures" and occasional exacerbation of the disease after the removal of the foci, a backlash to the "orgy" of dental extractions and tonsillectomies, an inability to replicate experiments, and a lack of controlled clinical studies.<ref name="CDA"/>

==Evolution and revival of FIT==

However, the fall of focal infection theory as primary cause of systemic disease did not mean the theory itself did not continue to find enough supporters to appear in textbooks such as Dougherty's 1954 ''Textbook of bacteriology'' regarding teeth and peer reviewed papers such as Galloway's 1957 JAMA article on tonsillectomies<ref>Dougherty, Joseph Mary ; Anthony James Lamberti (1954) Textbook of bacteriology; Mosby pg 231</ref><ref>Galloway, Thomas C. M.D. (1957)  "Relation of Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy to Poliomtyelitis" JAMA. 1957;163(7):519-521. {{doi|10.1001/jama.1957.02970420001001}}</ref> and as late as 1986 it was stated "(t)oday, in spite of a decline in the recognition of the focal infeciton theory the association of decayed teeth with systemic disease is taken very seriously."<ref>Dunning, James Morse 1986; ''Principles of dental public health'' Harvard University Press pg 272</ref>

Furthermore the mechanism of focal infection theory survived in general medicine with regards to specific diseases such as tuberculosis, gonorrhea, syphilis, pneumonia, typhoid fever, and mumps<ref>(1952) Southern California State Dental Association journal; pg 27</ref> as well as conditions such as idiopathic scrotal gangrene<ref>Bendavid, Robert; Jack Abrahamson, Maurice E. Arregui, Jean B. Flament, Edward H. Phillips (2001) ''Abdominal Wall Hernias: Principles and Management'' pg 192</ref> and angioneurotic edema.<ref>(1971) United States. Dept. of the Army Dental specialist: Sept. 20, 1971: Part 1 - Page 5-14</ref>

Finally a continual influx of new cases demonstrating its possible validity (as well as the fact that the behavior of ''untreated'' [[tooth abscess]] fitted the classic definition) kept the concept alive in the dental community<ref>Editorial. JAMA 1952; 150: 490.</ref><ref name="Bergenholtz 2009 135–136">{{Cite book

All these factors have resulted in a disagreement not only about when focal infection theory fell out of favor but also the degree to which it did.  For example in 2002 ''Ingle's Endodontics'' 5th edition stated "(i)n the 1930s, editorials and research refuted the theory of focal infection".<ref>Ingle, John Ide; Leif K. Bakland (2002) ''Endodontics'', Volume 1 PMPH-USA pg 63</ref> while 2006 ''Carranza's clinical periodontology'' stated "(t)he focal infection theory fell into disrepute in the 1940s and 1950s",<ref>Newman, Michael G.; Henry H. Takei, Fermín A. Carranza, Perry R. Klokkevold (2006) ''Carranza's clinical periodontology'', Saunders Elsevier, pg 313</ref> and  the 2009 ''Textbook of Endodontology'' stated that while it had lost its influence "dental focal infection theory never died"<ref name="Bergenholtz 2009 135–136"/>

In 1989 a respected study showed a significant correlation between poor dental health and myocardial infarction,<ref>Mattila K, Nieminen M, Valtonen V et al.  "Association between dental health and acute myocardial infarction" ''BMJ'' 298:779-82</ref> which was followed by other studies showing similar results, prompting the dental community to do a cautious reevaluation of focal infection theory.<ref>(2001) Fowler, Edward B [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3912/is_200101/ai_n8940315/ "Periodontal disease and its association with systemic disease"] ''Military Medicine'' (Jan 2001)</ref>  By 2006 the idea that some aspects of focal infection might be valid was finding greater validity especially in immunocompromised people.<ref>{{Cite book

In 1994, George E. Meinig published ''Root Canal Cover-up Exposed'' which resurrected the old studies by Rosenow and Price, raising the concern among dentists that patients hearing about these studies might view them as new and reliable.<ref name=Baumgartner2>{{Citation | author = Baumgartner JC, Bakland LK, Sugita EI | year = 2002 | title = Endodontics, Chapter 3: Microbiology of endodontics and asepsis in endodontic practice | url = http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/Dr.Hanan/BooksIngle/ch03.pdf |format=PDF| publisher  = Hamilton, Ontario: BC Becker | pages = 63–94 | accessdate = 2009-11-27}}</ref>  Hasselgren stated in New York Academy of Dentistry's ''Annals of dentistry'' that Meinig's book was in major need of professional editing, used Price's 1923 ''Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic'' (but not his other works), made unsubstantiated claims, confused the meaning of terms (such as [[infection]] and [[inflammation]]), and expanded into areas unrelated to the main topic to the point Hasselgren ends the review with the comment "I wonder how the serious researcher Weston Price would have reacted to the way his work has been presented."<ref name="Hasselgren, Gunnar 1994 pg 42">Hasselgren, Gunnar (1994) Annals of dentistry: Volumes 53-54 ''New York Academy of Dentistry'' pg 42)</ref>  Hasselgren observed, "[t]he focal infection theory, supported by many including Dr. Price, has been attacked, debated, accepted, criticized, agreed upon, etc. but it has not been covered up." Of modern dentistry he noted, "many clinicians appear today to have lost sight of the fact that endodontical treatment shall be based on biology and not on the use of various gadgets to sweep canals. Also, one-visit treatment of necrotic, infected teeth is being advocated and practiced even if no long-term study has been performed to investigate this kind of treatment.  The work of Dr. Weston Price is therefore still to a great extent valid and important and the role of infection can not be underestimated."<ref name="Hasselgren, Gunnar 1994 pg 42"/>

In a 2000 issue of the ''Journal of the California Dental Association'' Pallasch stated "The focal infection theory was (is) elegant in its simplicity and offered quick and easy (as well as lucrative) solutions to a myriad of problems for which medicine had no answers. It also afforded medicine the chance to deflect the blame from its ignorance to relative defenseless and unwitting victims: dentists and patients. All of its proponents were infected with the concept that "after it, because of it" for which even today there is no vaccine. Bearing the above in mind, it is useful to now examine the resurgence of the focal infection theory of disease in its newer guises."<ref name="CDA" />  In a 2003 issue of ''Endodontic Topic'' Pallasch expressed concern that these studies would be greeted with the same over enthusiasm that Weston Price's and Edward C Rosenow's rabbit experiments had been back in the 1920s and that said dentists advising dental treatment to reduce patient's risk for myocardial infarction or stroke were giving advice no more scientific than the ‘100 percenters’, ‘therapeutic edentulism’ and ‘clean sweep’ advice given in the heyday of focal infection theory.<ref>Pallasch, Thomas J. DDS; MS, and Michael J. Wahl, (2003) [http://collegeofdiplomates.org/DrLesterQuanDVD200905/ABE%20Part%201%20Written/Endodontic%20Topics%20%20-%20Vol%201%20thru%20Vol%2015/Endodontic%20Topics%20Vol%204/,DanaInfo=www.blackwell-synergy.com%2Bj.1601-1546.2003.00002.pdf "Focal infection: new age or ancient history?"] Endodontic Topics, 4, 32–45</ref>

In the introduction to a supplement of the [[Journal of the American Dental Association]] dedicated to this renewed interest, Micheal L. Barnett states that "[t]he investigation into oral-systemic disease connections is a rapidly advancing area of research."<ref name="Barnett"/>  Barnett cautions his readers that it is important to distinguish between data that merely suggest correlations between oral infection and systemic disease and data that show a causal relationship.<ref>[http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/13/4/547/ Systemic Diseases Caused by Oral Infection] - Department of Oral Biology and Department of Endodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway</ref>  With that in mind, the articles in the supplement investigate "the connection between dental plaque and periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes, cardiovascular disease, bacterial pneumonia and diabetes."<ref name="Barnett"/>
