'''Multiple sclerosis''' ('''MS'''), also known as "disseminated sclerosis" or "encephalomyelitis disseminata", is an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[disease]] in which the [[fat]]ty [[myelin]] sheaths around the [[axon]]s of the [[Human brain|brain]] and [[spinal cord]] are damaged, leading to [[demyelinating disease|demyelination]] and [[scar]]ring as well as a broad spectrum of [[medical sign|signs]] and [[symptom]]s.<ref name="pmid18970977">{{cite journal

MS affects the ability of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to communicate with each other effectively. Nerve cells communicate by sending electrical signals called [[action potential]]s down long fibers called [[axon]]s, which are contained within an insulating substance called [[myelin]]. In MS, the body's own [[immune system]] attacks and damages the myelin. When myelin is lost, the axons can no longer effectively conduct signals.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> The name ''multiple sclerosis'' refers to scars (sclerae-—better known as plaques or lesions) particularly in the [[white matter]] of the brain and spinal cord, which is mainly composed of myelin.<ref name="Charcot1"/> Although much is known about the mechanisms involved in the disease process, the cause remains unknown. Theories include [[genetics]] or [[infection]]s. Different environmental [[risk factor]]s have also been found.<ref name="pmid11955556"/><ref name="pmid17444504"/>

Almost any neurological [[symptom]] can appear with the disease, and the disease often progresses to physical and [[cognitive disability]].<ref name="pmid11955556"/> MS takes several forms, with new symptoms occurring either in discrete attacks (relapsing forms) or  accumulating over time (progressive forms).<ref name="pmid8780061"/> Between attacks, symptoms may go away completely, but permanent neurological deficits often occur, especially as the disease advances.<ref name="pmid8780061"/>

There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatments attempt to return function after an attack, prevent new attacks, and prevent disability.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> MS medications can have adverse effects or be poorly tolerated, and many people pursue alternative treatments, despite the lack of supporting scientific study. The [[prognosis]] is difficult to predict; it depends on the subtype of the disease, the individual's disease characteristics, the initial symptoms and the degree of disability the person experiences as time advances.<ref name="pmid8017890"/> [[Life expectancy]] of people with MS is 5 to 10 years lower than that of the unaffected population.<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

==Causes==
Most likely MS occurs as a result of some combination of genetic, environmental and infectious factors,<ref name="pmid18970977"/> and possibly other factors like vascular problems.<ref name="pmid16687046">{{cite journal|author=Minagar A, Jy W, Jimenez JJ, Alexander JS.

Theories try to combine the known data into plausible explanations, but none has proved definitive.

===Genetics===
[[File:HLA.svg|thumb|right|HLA region of Chromosome&nbsp;6. Changes in this area increase the probability of suffering MS.]]
MS is not considered a [[hereditary]] disease. However, a number of [[genetics|genetic variations]] have been shown to increase the risk of developing the disease.<ref name="pmid14747002">{{cite journal|author=Dyment DA, Ebers GC, Sadovnick AD |title=Genetics of multiple sclerosis
|journal=Lancet Neurol|volume=3|issue=92|pages=104–10|year=2004|month=February|pmid=14747002|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(03)00663-X}}</ref>

The risk of acquiring MS is higher in relatives of a person with the disease than in the general population, especially in the case of [[sibling]]s, parents, and children.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> The disease has an overall familial recurrence rate of 20%.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> In the case of monozygotic [[twin]]s, concordance occurs only in about 35% of cases, while it goes down to around 5% in the case of siblings and even lower in half-siblings. This indicates susceptibility is partly [[Quantitative trait locus|polygenically]] driven.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name="pmid11955556"/> It seems to be more common in some ethnic groups than others.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Who gets MS?| url = http://www.mstrust.org.uk/information/publications/msexplained/who_gets_ms.jsp| publisher = Multiple Sclerosis Trust| date = December 30, 2009| accessdate = April 18, 2011}}</ref>

Apart from familial studies, specific [[gene]]s have been linked with MS. Differences in the [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) system—a group of genes in [[chromosome]] [[Chromosome 6 (human)|6]] that serves as the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) in humans—increase the probability of suffering MS.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as [[HLA-DR15|DR15]] and [[HLA-DQ6|DQ6]].<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as [[HLA-C554]] and [[HLA-DRB1]]*11.<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

===Environmental factors===
Different environmental factors, both of infectious and non-infectious origin, have been proposed as risk factors for MS. Although some are partly modifiable, only further research—especially clinical trials—will reveal whether their elimination can help prevent MS.<ref name="pmid15556803"/>

MS is more common in people who live farther from the equator, although many exceptions exist.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Decreased sunlight exposure has been linked with a higher risk of MS.<ref name="pmid15556803"/> Decreased [[vitamin D]] production and intake has been the main biological mechanism used to explain the higher risk among those less exposed to sun.<ref name="pmid15556803"/><ref name="pmid17492755"/><ref name="pmid20494325">{{cite journal |author=Ascherio A, Munger KL, Simon KC |title=Vitamin D and multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=599–612 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20494325 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(10)70086-7 }}</ref>

Severe [[Stress (biological)|stress]] may be a risk factor although evidence is weak.<ref name="pmid15556803"/> [[Tobacco smoking|Smoking]] has also been shown to be an independent risk factor for developing MS.<ref name="pmid17492755"/> Association with occupational exposures and [[toxin]]s—mainly [[solvent]]s—has been evaluated, but no clear conclusions have been reached.<ref name="pmid15556803"/> [[Vaccin]]ations were investigated as causal factors for the disease; however, most studies show no association between MS and vaccines.<ref name="pmid15556803"/> Several other possible risk factors, such as [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]]<ref name="pmid9839742">{{cite journal |author=Ghadirian P, Jain M, Ducic S, Shatenstein B, Morisset R |title=Nutritional factors in the aetiology of multiple sclerosis: a case-control study in Montreal, Canada |journal=Int J Epidemiol. |year=1998 |pmid=9839742 |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=845–52 |doi=10.1093/ije/27.5.845}} (primary source)</ref> and [[hormone]] intake, have been investigated; however, evidence on their relation with the disease is "sparse and unpersuasive".<ref name="pmid17492755"/>

[[Gout]] occurs less than would statistically be expected in people with MS, and low levels of [[uric acid]] have been found in people with MS as compared to normal individuals. This led to the theory that uric acid protects against MS, although its exact importance remains unknown.<ref name="pmid18219824">{{cite journal|author=Spitsin S, Koprowski H|title=Role of uric acid in multiple sclerosis|journal=Curr.

===Infections===
Many microbes have been proposed as potential infectious triggers of MS, but none have been substantiated.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> Moving at an early age from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS.<ref name="pmid17444504"/> An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare pathogen, is the origin of the disease.<ref name="pmid17444504"/> There are a number of proposed mechanisms, including the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The [[hygiene hypothesis]] proposes that exposure to several infectious agents early in life is protective against MS, the disease being a response to a later encounter with such agents.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to a [[pathogen]] more common in regions of high MS prevalence where in most individuals it causes an [[asymptomatic]] persistent infection. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination.<ref name="pmid17444504"/><ref name="pmid8269393"/> The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.<ref name="pmid17444504"/>

Evidence for viruses as a cause includes the presence of [[oligoclonal bands]] in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination [[encephalomyelitis]], and induction of demyelination in animals through viral infection.<ref name="pmid15721830">{{cite journal|author=Gilden DH|title=Infectious causes of multiple sclerosis|journal=[[The Lancet Neurology]]|volume=4|issue=3|pages=195–202|year=2005|month=March|pmid=15721830|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)01017-3}}</ref> [[Human herpes virus]]es are a candidate group of viruses linked to MS. Individuals who have never been infected by the [[Epstein-Barr]] virus have a reduced risk of having the disease, and those infected as young adults have a greater risk than those who had it at a younger age.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name="pmid17444504"/> Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the noninfected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing,<ref name="pmid17444504"/> others believe that there is no contradiction since it is a first encounter at a later moment with the causative virus that is the trigger for the disease.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Other diseases that have also been related with MS are [[measles]], [[mumps]], and [[rubella]].<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

[[Image:MS Demyelinisation KB 10x.jpg|thumb|Demyelination in MS. On Klüver-Barrera myelin staining, decoloration in the area of the lesion can be appreciated (Original scale 1:100).]]

===Autoimmunology===
MS is believed to be an [[Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases|immune-mediated]] disorder mediated by a complex interaction of the individual's genetics and as yet unidentified environmental insults.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> Damage is believed to be caused by the person's own immune system attacking the nervous system.  Possible targets of the immune response include myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP).  The commonly prescribed MS drug [[Copaxone]] was designed to mimic MBP and therefore act as a decoy for autoreactive immune cells.  Even so, the role of MBP in MS is controversial; it is buried within the myelin sheath (rather than on the surface), where immune cells would not be able to recognize it.

Recent data suggest a role for myelin lipids in MS.<ref name="pmid22674551">{{cite journal|author=Ho,PP et al.|title=Identification of naturally occurring fatty acids of the myelin sheath that resolve neuroinflammation|journal=Science Translational Medicine|volume=4|issue=137|pages=137–73|year=2012|pmid=22674551|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3003831|last2=Kanter|first2=J. L.|last3=Johnson|first3=A. M.|last4=Srinagesh|first4=H. K.|last5=Chang|first5=E.-J.|last6=Purdy|first6=T. M.|last7=Van Haren|first7=K.|last8=Wikoff|first8=W. R.|last9=Kind|first9=T.}}</ref>  Historically, researchers have assumed the myelin target was a protein, even though the myelin sheath is nearly 80% lipid.  Furthermore, lipids are known to be the target of another prominent nervous system autoimmune condition, [[Guillain-Barre Syndrome]].

Whether the autoantigen is a protein or a lipid, autoimmunity may arise when immune cells recognizing a foreign antigen cross-react with self antigens.  This process is known as [[molecular mimicry]].<ref name="pmid11955556"/><ref name="molecularmimicry">{{cite journal|author=Wucherpfennig, K.; Strominger, J.|title=Molecular mimicry in T cell-mediated autoimmunity: Viral peptides activate human T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein|journal=Cell|volume=80|issue=5|pages=695–705|year=1995|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90348-8|pmid=7534214}}</ref>

====Lesions====
The name ''multiple sclerosis'' refers to the scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. MS lesions most commonly involve [[white matter]] areas close to the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]] of the [[cerebellum]], [[brain stem]], [[basal ganglia]] and [[spinal cord]]; and the [[optic nerve]]. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between [[grey matter]] areas, where the processing is done, and the rest of the body. The [[peripheral nervous system]] is rarely involved.<ref name="pmid11955556">{{cite journal|author=Compston A, Coles A|title=Multiple sclerosis|journal=Lancet|volume=359|issue=9313|pages=1221–31|year=2002|month=April|pmid=11955556|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08220-X}}</ref>

More specifically, MS destroys [[oligodendrocyte]]s, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the [[myelin]] sheath—which helps the neurons carry [[Action potential|electrical signals]] (action potentials).<ref name="pmid11955556"/> MS results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, the cutting (transection) of the neuron's [[axons]]. When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> A repair process, called [[remyelination]], takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes cannot completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath.<ref name="pmid17531860">{{cite journal|author=Chari DM|title=Remyelination in multiple sclerosis|journal=Int. Rev. Neurobiol.|volume=79|pages=589–620|year=2007|pmid=17531860|doi=10.1016/S0074-7742(07)79026-8|series=International Review of Neurobiology|isbn=978-0-12-373736-6}}</ref> Repeated attacks lead to successively fewer effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons.<ref name="pmid17531860"/> [[pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis#Demyelination patterns|Different lesion patterns]] have been described.<ref name="pmid17351524">{{cite journal |author=Pittock SJ, Lucchinetti CF |title=The pathology of MS: new insights and potential clinical applications |journal=Neurologist |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=45–56 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17351524 |doi=10.1097/01.nrl.0000253065.31662.37 }}</ref>

====Inflammation====
Apart from demyelination, the other pathologic hallmark of the disease is [[inflammation]]. According to a strictly [[immunological]] explanation of MS, the inflammatory process is caused by [[T cell]]s, a kind of [[lymphocyte]]. Lymphocytes are cells that play an important role in the body's defenses.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> In MS, T cells gain entry into the brain via disruptions in the [[blood–brain barrier]]. Evidence from animal models also point to a role of [[B cell]]s in addition to T cells in development of the disease.<ref name="pmid11596130">{{cite journal |author=Iglesias A, Bauer J, Litzenburger T, Schubart A, Linington C |title=T- and B-cell responses to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis |journal=Glia |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=220–34 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11596130 |doi= 10.1002/glia.1111}}</ref>

The T cells recognize myelin as foreign and attack it as if it were an invading virus. This triggers inflammatory processes, stimulating other immune cells and soluble factors like [[cytokine]]s and [[antibodies]]. Further leaks form in the blood–brain barrier, which in turn cause a number of other damaging effects such as [[edema|swelling]], activation of [[macrophages]], and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins.<ref name="pmid11955556"/>

===Blood–brain barrier breakdown===
The [[blood–brain barrier]] is a part of the [[capillary]] system that prevents the entry of T cells into the central nervous system.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> However, it may become permeable to these types of cells because of an infection or a virus.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> When the blood–brain barrier regains its integrity, typically after the infection or virus has cleared, the T cells are trapped inside the brain.<ref name="pmid11955556"/>

==Diagnosis==
Multiple sclerosis can be difficult to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]] since its signs and symptoms may be similar to other medical problems.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name="pmid11794488">{{cite journal|author=Trojano M, Paolicelli D|title=The differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: classification and clinical features of relapsing and progressive neurological syndromes |journal=Neurol.

Currently, the [[McDonald criteria]] focus on a demonstration with clinical, laboratory and radiologic data of the dissemination of MS lesions in time and space for non-invasive MS diagnosis, though some have stated that the only proved diagnosis of MS is autopsy, or occasionally biopsy, where lesions typical of MS can be detected through histopathological techniques.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name="pmid11456302">{{cite journal|author=McDonald WI, Compston A, Edan G, ''et al.'' |title=Recommended diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: guidelines from the International Panel on the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis |journal=Ann.

Clinical data alone may be sufficient for a diagnosis of MS if an individual has suffered separate episodes of neurologic symptoms characteristic of MS.<ref name="pmid11456302"/> Since some people seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing may hasten and ease the diagnosis.

===Clinical courses===
[[Image:Ms progression types.svg|thumb|300px|Progression of MS subtypes]]

Several subtypes, or patterns of progression, have been described. Subtypes use the past course of the disease in an attempt to [[predict]] the future course. They are important not only for prognosis but also for therapeutic decisions. In 1996 the United States [[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]] standardized four clinical courses:<ref name="pmid8780061"/>
# relapsing remitting,
# secondary progressive,
# primary progressive, and
# progressive relapsing.

The relapsing-remitting subtype is characterized by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet ([[remission (medicine)|remission]]) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits suffered during attacks may either resolve or leave [[sequelae]], the latter being more common as a function of time.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> When deficits always resolve between attacks, this is sometimes referred to as ''[[benign]] MS'',<ref name="pmid18219812">{{cite journal|author=Pittock SJ, Rodriguez M|title=Benign multiple sclerosis: a distinct clinical entity with therapeutic implications|journal=Curr.

[[File:Nerve.nida.jpg|thumb|left|Nerve axon with myelin sheath]]

Secondary progressive MS describes around 65% of those with an initial relapsing-remitting MS, who then begin to have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name="pmid8780061"/> Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear.<ref name="pmid8780061"/> The median time between disease onset and conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive MS is 19&nbsp;years.<ref name="pmid16545751">{{cite journal|author=Rovaris M, Confavreux C, Furlan R, Kappos L, Comi G, Filippi M|title=Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: current knowledge and future challenges |journal=Lancet Neurol|volume=5|issue=4|pages=343–54|year=2006|month=April|pmid=16545751|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(06)70410-0}}</ref>

It is characterized by progression of disability from onset, with no, or only occasional and minor, remissions and improvements.<ref name="pmid8780061"/> The age of onset for the primary progressive subtype is later than for the relapsing-remitting, but similar to mean age of progression between the relapsing-remitting and the secondary progressive. In both cases it is around 40 years of age.<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

Progressive relapsing MS describes those individuals who, from onset, have a steady neurologic decline but also suffer clear superimposed attacks. This is the least common of all subtypes.<ref name="pmid8780061"/>

[[Idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases|Atypical variants of MS with non-standard behavior]] have been described; these include [[Devic's disease]], [[Balo concentric sclerosis]], [[Diffuse myelinoclastic sclerosis|Schilder's diffuse sclerosis]] and [[Marburg multiple sclerosis]].

==Management==
{{Main|Treatment of multiple sclerosis}}

Although there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS have several [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]]. [[Alternative medicine|Alternative treatments]] are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study.

===Acute attacks===
During symptomatic attacks, administration of high doses of [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[corticosteroid]]s, such as [[methylprednisolone]], is the routine therapy for acute relapses,<ref name="pmid18970977"/> while oral corticosteroids seem to have a similar efficacy and safety profile.<ref>{{cite cochrane|last=Burton|first=JM|coauthors=O'Connor, PW; Hohol, M; Beyene, J|title=Oral versus intravenous steroids for treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012 Dec 12|issue=12|review=CD006921|pmid=23235634}}</ref> Although generally effective in the short term for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery.<ref name="RCOP_acute">{{cite book|first=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions|title=Multiple sclerosis : national clinical guideline for diagnosis and management in primary and secondary care|year=2004|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London|isbn=1-86016-182-0|pages=54–57|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK48919/pdf/TOC.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2013|format=pdf|pmid=21290636}}</ref> Consequences of severe attacks which do not respond to corticosteroids might be treated by [[plasmapheresis]].<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

===Disease-modifying treatments===
[[Image:Injection 23.JPG|right|thumb|Disease-modifying treatments are expensive and most of these require frequent (up-to-daily) injections. Others require IV infusions (pictured) at 1–3 month intervals.]]

As of April 2013, eight disease-modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies of different countries. The approved drugs are [[interferon beta-1a]], [[interferon beta-1b]], [[glatiramer acetate]], [[mitoxantrone]], [[natalizumab]], [[fingolimod]], [[teriflunomide]] and [[dimethyl fumarate]].<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name=Fingolimod/><ref name=Aubagio/><ref name=fumarate>{{cite news|title=Biogen Idec’s TECFIDERA™ (Dimethyl Fumarate) Approved in US as a First-Line Oral Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis|url=http://www.biogenidec.com/press_release_details.aspx?ID=5981&ReqId=1801165|date=2013-03-27|agency=Biogen Idec Press Release}}</ref><ref name=fumarateNDA>{{cite web |title=NDA 204063 - FDA Approved Labeling Text |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/204063lbl.pdf |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2013 |publisher=US Food and Drug Agency }}<br>{{cite web  |title=NDA Approval |date=27 March 2013 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2013/204063Orig1s000ltr.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2013 |publisher=US Food and Drug Agency }}</ref>

The interferons and glatiramer acetate are delivered by frequent injections, varying from once-per-day for glatiramer acetate to once-per-week (but intra-muscular) for interferon beta-1a.
Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are given by intravenous (IV) infusion at monthly intervals in the case of natalizumab and every three months in the case of mitoxantrone.<ref name="natalizumab">[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a605006.html Natalizumab Injection.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) (2006-10-01).

As with many medical treatments, these treatments have several adverse effects. One of the most common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferon treatments.

===Associated symptoms===
Disease-modifying treatments reduce the progression rate of the disease, but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptomatology tends to increase. The disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and [[disability]]. Management of these deficits is therefore very important.

The [[prognosis]] (the expected future course of the disease) for a person with multiple sclerosis depends on the subtype of the disease; the individual's sex, age, and initial symptoms; and the degree of [[disability]] the person experiences.<ref name="pmid8017890">{{cite journal|author=Weinshenker BG|title=Natural history of multiple sclerosis|journal=Ann.

==Epidemiology==
Two main measures are used in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies: incidence and prevalence. [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is the number of new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years); while [[prevalence]] is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at a given time.
Prevalence is known to depend not only on incidence, but also on survival rate and migrations of affected people. MS has a prevalence that ranges between 2 and 150 per 100,000 depending on the country or specific population.<ref name="pmid11603614"/>

Environmental factors during childhood may play an important role in the development of MS later in life. Several studies of migrants show that if migration occurs before the age of 15, the migrant acquires the new region's susceptibility to MS. If migration takes place after age 15, the migrant retains the susceptibility of his home country.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name="pmid15556803"/> However, the age–geographical risk for developing multiple sclerosis may span a larger timescale.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> A relationship between season of birth and MS has also been found which lends support to an association with sunlight and vitamin D.

==History==

===Medical discovery===
[[Image:Carswell-Multiple Sclerosis2.jpg|thumb|Detail of Carswell's drawing of MS lesions in the [[brain stem]] and [[spinal cord]] (1838)]]

The French [[neurologist]] [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825–1893) was the first person to recognize multiple sclerosis as a distinct disease in 1868.<ref name="pmid3066846"/> Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and pathological observations, Charcot called the disease ''sclerose en plaques''. The three signs of MS now known as [[Charcot's triad 1]] are [[nystagmus]], [[intention tremor]], and [[telegraphic speech]] (scanning speech), though these are not unique to MS. Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a "marked enfeeblement of the memory" and "conceptions that formed slowly".<ref name="Charcot1">{{cite journal |author=Clanet M |title=Jean-Martin Charcot. 1825 to 1893 |journal=Int MS J |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=59–61 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18782501 |url= http://www.msforum.net/Site/ViewPDF/ViewPDF.aspx?ArticleID=E80DC748-5048-4BD2-9393-18BCAE0A1514&doctype=Article |format=PDF}}<br />* {{cite journal |author=Charcot, J. |year=1868 |title=Histologie de la sclerose en plaques |journal=Gazette des hopitaux, Paris |volume=41 |pages=554–5 }}</ref>

Before Charcot, [[Robert Carswell]] (1793–1857), a British professor of [[pathology]], and [[Jean Cruveilhier]] (1791–1873), a French professor of pathologic anatomy, had described and illustrated many of the disease's clinical details, but did not identify it as a separate disease.<ref name="pmid3066846">{{cite journal|author=Compston A|title=The 150th anniversary of the first depiction of the lesions of multiple sclerosis|journal=J.

After Charcot's description, [[Eugène Devic]] (1858–1930), Jozsef Balo (1895–1979), [[Paul Ferdinand Schilder]] (1886–1940), and [[Otto Marburg]] (1874–1948) described special cases of the disease. During all the 20th century there was an important development on the theories about the cause and pathogenesis of MS while efficacious treatments began to appear in 1990.<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

===Historical cases===
There are several historical accounts of people who lived before or shortly after the disease was described by Charcot and probably had MS.

A young woman called Halldora who lived in [[Iceland]] around 1200 suddenly lost her vision and mobility but, after praying to the saints, recovered them seven days after. [[Saint Lidwina]] of [[Schiedam]] (1380–1433), a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[nun]], may be one of the first clearly identifiable MS patients. From the age of 16 until her death at 53, she suffered intermittent pain, weakness of the legs, and vision loss&mdash;symptoms typical of MS.<ref name="pmid390966">{{cite journal|author=Medaer R|title=Does the history of multiple sclerosis go back as far as the 14th century?|journal=Acta Neurol.

[[Augustus d'Este|Augustus Frederick d'Este]] (1794–1848), son of [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex]] and [[Lady Augusta Murray]] and the grandson of [[George&nbsp;III of the United Kingdom]], almost certainly suffered from MS. D'Este left a detailed diary describing his 22 years living with the disease. His diary began in 1822 and ended in 1846, although it remained unknown until 1948. His symptoms began at age 28 with a sudden transient visual loss ([[amaurosis fugax]]) after the funeral of a friend. During the course of his disease, he developed weakness of the legs, clumsiness of the hands, numbness, dizziness, bladder disturbances, and [[erectile dysfunction]]. In 1844, he began to use a wheelchair. Despite his illness, he kept an optimistic view of life.<ref>{{cite book|last= Firth|first=D|title= The Case of August D`Esté |year=1948|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}</ref><ref name="pmid16103678">{{cite journal|author=Pearce JM |title=Historical descriptions of multiple sclerosis|journal=Eur.

Another early account of MS was kept by the British diarist [[W. N. P. Barbellion]], [[nom-de-plume]] of Bruce Frederick Cummings (1889–1919), who maintained a detailed log of his diagnosis and struggle with MS.<ref name="pmid16103678"/> His diary was published in 1919 as ''[[The Journal of a Disappointed Man]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last= Barbellion|first= Wilhelm Nero Pilate|title= The Journal of a Disappointed Man |year=1919|publisher=George H.

===Disease biomarkers===
The variable clinical presentation of MS and the lack of diagnostic laboratory tests lead to delays in diagnosis and the impossibility of predicting diagnosis. New diagnostic methods are being investigated. These include work with anti-myelin [[antibody|antibodies]], analysis of [[DNA microarray|microarray]] gene expression and studies with serum and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] but none of them has yielded reliable positive results.<ref name="pmid19712003">{{cite journal |author=Harris VK, Sadiq SA |title=Disease biomarkers in multiple sclerosis: potential for use in therapeutic decision making |journal=Mol Diagn Ther |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=225–44 |year=2009 |pmid=19712003 |doi=10.2165/11313470-000000000-00000}}</ref>

Currently there are no clinically established laboratory investigations available that can predict prognosis. However, several promising approaches have been proposed. Investigations on the prediction of evolution have centered on monitoring disease activity. Disease activation biomarkers include [[interleukin-6]], [[nitric oxide]] and [[nitric oxide synthase]], [[osteopontin]], and [[fetuin]]-A.<ref name="pmid19712003"/> On the other hand since disease progression is the result of neurodegeneration the roles of proteins indicative of [[neuron]]al, [[axon]]al, and [[glia]]l loss such as [[neurofilament]]s, [[Tau protein|tau]] and [[N-acetylaspartate]] are under investigation.<ref name="pmid19712003"/>

A final investigative field is work with biomarkers that distinguish between medication responders and nonresponders.<ref name="pmid19712003"/>

===Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency===
{{Main|Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency}}
In 2008, Italian vascular surgeon [[Paolo Zamboni]] reported research suggesting that MS involves a [[Circulatory system|vascular]] disease process he referred to as [[chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency]] (CCSVI, CCVI), in which veins from the brain are constricted. He found CCSVI in the majority of people with MS, performed a surgical procedure to correct it and claimed that 73% of people improved.<ref name="pmid19060024">{{Cite journal |author=Zamboni P, Galeotti R, Menegatti E, ''et al.'' |title=Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=J.
