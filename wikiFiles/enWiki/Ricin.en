'''Ricin''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|r|aɪ|s|ɪ|n}}), from the [[castor oil plant]] ''Ricinus communis'', is a highly toxic, naturally occurring [[protein]]. A dose the size of a few grains of table salt can kill an adult human.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/What-Makes-Ricin-So-Deadly-203512561.html|title=What Makes Ricin So Deadly[1&#93; - What Makes Ricin So Deadly |publisher= Anthony Sabella |date= |accessdate=2013-04-24}}</ref> The [[Median lethal dose|median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>) of ricin is around 22 micrograms per kilogram (1.78&nbsp;mg for an average adult, around {{frac|1|228}} of a standard aspirin tablet/0.4&nbsp;g gross) in humans if exposure is from [[injection (medicine)|injection]] or [[inhalation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/efsa_locale-1178620753812_1211902083375.htm |title=EFSA Scientific Opinion: Ricin (from Ricinus communis) as undesirable substances in animal feed [1&#93; - Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain |publisher=Efsa.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref> Oral exposure to ricin is far less toxic and a lethal dose can be up to 20–30&nbsp;milligrams per kilogram. 

[[Abrin]] is a toxin found in the highly ornamental [[rosary pea]]. It is similar to ricin but even more toxic.

==Overdose==
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}
Most acute poisoning episodes in humans are the result of oral ingestion of castor beans, 5–20 of which could prove fatal to an adult. Victims often manifest nausea, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypotension and seizures persisting for up to a week.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Blood, plasma, or urine ricin concentrations may be measured to confirm diagnosis.<ref>{{cite book |author=R.

==Biochemistry==
Ricin is classified as a type 2 [[ribosome inactivating protein]] (RIP). Whereas Type 1 RIPs consist of a single enzymatic protein chain, Type 2 RIPs, also known as [[holotoxin]]s, or [[heterodimeric]] [[glycoprotein]]s. Type 2 RIPs consist of an A chain that is functionally equivalent to a Type 1 RIP, covalently connected by a single [[disulfide bond]] to a B chain that is catalytically inactive, but serves to mediate entry of the A-B protein complex into the [[cytosol]]. Both Type 1 and Type 2 RIPs are functionally active against ribosomes ''in vitro'', however only Type 2 RIPs display [[cytoxicity]] due to the [[lectin]]-like properties of the B chain. In order to display its ribosome-inactivating function, the ricin disulfide bond must be [[redox|reductively]] cleaved.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0003-9861(87)90447-4 |title=The intersubunit disulfide bridge of ricin is essential for cytotoxicity |year=1987 |last1=Wright |first1=H.

The tertiary structure of ricin was shown to be a globular, [[glycosylation|glycosylated]] heterodimer of approximately 60–65 [[Dalton (unit)|kDa]].<ref name=aplin/> Ricin toxin A chain and ricin toxin B chain are of similar molecular weights, approximately 32 kDa and 34 kDa, respectively.

Many plants such as [[barley]] have the A chain but not the B&nbsp;chain. People do not get sick from eating large amounts of such products, as ricin&nbsp;A is of extremely low toxicity as long as the B&nbsp;chain is not present.

===Entry into the cytosol===
The ability of ricin to enter the [[cytosol]] depends on [[hydrogen bond]]ing interactions between RTB amino acid residues and complex carbohydrates on the surface of [[eukaryotic]] cells containing either terminal [[N-acetylgalactosamine]] or beta-1,4-linked galactose residues. Additionally, the [[mannose]]-type [[glycan]]s of ricin are able to bind cells that express [[mannose receptor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/excr.1993.1065 |title=Characterization of Two Distinct Pathways of Endocytosis of Ricin by Rat Liver Endothelial Cells |year=1993 |last1=Magnusson |first1=S |journal=Experimental Cell Research |volume=205 |pages=118–25 |pmid=8453986 |last2=Kjeken |first2=R |last3=Berg |first3=T |issue=1}}</ref> Experimentally, RTB has been shown to bind to the cell surface on the order of 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>8</sup> ricin molecules per cell surface.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.270.35.20292 |title=Mutational Analysis of the Ricinus Lectin B-chains |year=1995 |last1=Lord |first1=J.

The profuse binding of ricin to surface membranes allows internalization with all types of membrane [[invagination]]s.

===Ribosome inactivation===
Study of the N-[[glycosidase]] activity of ricin was pioneered by Endo and Tsurugi<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3036799 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3036799 |title=RNA N-glycosidase activity of ricin A-chain.

They subsequently showed RTA specifically and irreversibly [[hydrolyses]] the N-glycosidic bond of the [[adenine]] residue at position 4324 (A4324) within the [[28S ribosomal RNA|28S]] rRNA, but leaves the [[phosphodiester]] backbone of the RNA intact.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3288622 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3288622 |title=The RNA N-glycosidase activity of ricin A-chain.

A single RTA molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute.

===Depurination reaction===
Within the active site of RTA, there exist several invariant amino acid residues involved in the [[depurination]] of ribosomal RNA.<ref name=pmid14579547/>  Although the exact mechanism of the event is unknown, key amino acid residues identified include [[tyrosine]] at positions 80 and 123, [[glutamic acid]] at position 177, and [[arginine]] at position 180. In particular, Arg180 and Glu177 have been shown to be involved in the [[catalytic]] mechanism, and not substrate binding, with [[enzyme kinetics|enzyme kinetic]] studies involving RTA mutants. The model proposed by Mozingo and Robertus,<ref name=pmid7990130/> based x-ray structures, is as follows:
#Sarcin-ricin loop substrate binds RTA active site with target adenine stacking against tyr80 and tyr123.
#Arg180 is positioned such that it can [[protonate]] N-3 of adenine and break the bond between N-9 of the adenine ring and C-1’ of the [[ribose]].
#[[Bond cleavage]] results in an [[oxycarbonium]] ion on the ribose, stabilized by Glu177.
#N-3 protonation of adenine by Arg180 allows [[deprotonation]] of a nearby water molecule.
#Resulting [[hydroxyl]] attacks ribose [[carbonium ion]].
#Depurination of adenine results in a neutral ribose on an intact phosphodiester RNA backbone.

==Manufacture==
Ricin is easily [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purified]] from [[castor oil]] manufacturing waste. The aqueous phase left over from the oil extraction process is called waste mash. It would contain about 5–10% ricin by weight, but heating during the oil extraction process denatures the protein, making the resultant seed cake safe for use as animal feed. Ricin can be isolated from fresh seed by [[affinity chromatography#lectins|chromatographic]] techniques similar to those routinely used for [[protein purification|purification]] of many other plant proteins.

===Patented extraction process===
A process for extracting ricin has been described in a [[patent]].<ref>"Preparation of Toxic Ricin", {{US patent|3060165}}, assigned to the [[U.S. Secretary of the Army]], inventors: Harry L. Craig, O. H. Alderks, Alsoph H. Corwin, Sally H.

==Potential medicinal use==
Some researchers {{who|date=April 2013}} have speculated about using ricins in the treatment of [[cancer]], as a so-called "magic bullet" to destroy targeted cells.<ref name=pmid14579547/> Because ricin is a protein, it can be linked to a [[monoclonal antibody]] to target [[malignant]] cells recognized by the antibody. The major problem with ricin is that its native internalization sequences are distributed throughout the protein. If any of these native internalization sequences are present in a therapeutic, then the drug will be internalized by, and kill, untargeted [[epithelial cell]]s as well as targeted cancer cells.

Some researchers {{who|date=April 2013}} hope that modifying ricin will sufficiently lessen the likelihood that the ricin component of these [[immunotoxin]]s will cause the wrong cells to internalize it, while still retaining its cell-killing activity when it is internalized by the targeted cells.  Generally, however, ricin has been superseded for medical purposes by more practical fragments of bacterial toxins, such as [[diphtheria toxin]], which is used in [[denileukin diftitox]], an FDA-approved treatment for leukemia and lymphoma.  No approved therapeutics contain ricin.

A promising approach is also to use the non-toxic B subunit (a lectin) as a vehicle for delivering [[antigen]]s into cells, thus greatly increasing their [[immunogenicity]]. Use of ricin as an [[adjuvant]] has potential implications for developing [[mucosal]] [[vaccine]]s.

Ricinine has some insecticidal effects on three insect pests as well as a [[hepatoprotective]] activity. Ricinine, when administered to mice at low doses has memory-improving effects.
The signs of intoxication caused by ricinine can be used as chemical model of [[epilepsy]] in the screening of anticonvulsant drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Xiao |last2=Li |first2=Duan |title=Biological activity of ricinine and outlook of its applied development |journal=Chinese Journal of Pharmacology and Toxicology |year=2006 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=76–8 |url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-YLBS200601014.htm}}</ref>

== Regulation ==
In the U.S., ricin appears on the [[select agent]]s list of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]],<ref>HHS and USDA Select Agents and Toxins 7 CFR Part 331, 9 CFR Part 121, and 42 CFR Part 73. http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/docs/salist.pdf</ref> and scientists must register with HHS to use ricin in their research. However, investigators possessing less than 100&nbsp;mg are exempt from regulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Permissible Toxin Amounts|url=http://www.selectagents.gov/Permissible%20Toxin%20Amounts.html|publisher=National Select Agent Registy|accessdate=24 April 2013}}</ref>

==Use as a chemical or biological warfare agent==
The [[United States]] investigated ricin for its military potential during World War I.<ref name="Augerson2000">Augerson, William S.; Spektor, Dalia M.; United States Dept. of Defense, Office of the Secretary of Defense, National Defense Research Institute (U.S.) (2000). ''A Review of the Scientific Literature as it Pertains to Gulf War Illnesses.'' Rand Corporation, ISBN 978-0-8330-2680-4{{page needed|date=April 2013}}</ref> At that time it was being considered for use either as a toxic dust or as a coating for [[bullet]]s and [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]]. The [[dust cloud]] concept could not be adequately developed, and the coated bullet/shrapnel concept would violate the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention of 1899]] (adopted in U.S. law at 32 [[United States Statutes at Large|Stat.]] 1903), specifically Annex §2, Ch.1, Article 23, stating "...&nbsp;it is especially prohibited&nbsp;... [t]o employ poison or poisoned arms".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hague02.asp#art23 |title=The Avalon Project&nbsp;— Laws of War : Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague II); July 29, 1899 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref> World War I ended before the United States weaponized ricin.

During World War II the United States and [[Canada]] undertook studying ricin in [[cluster bomb]]s.<ref name="gupta2009">{{cite book |author=Gupta, Ramesh C. |year=2009 |title=Handbook of Toxicology of Chemical Warfare Agents |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-374484-5}}{{page needed|date=April 2013}}</ref> Though there were plans for [[mass production]] and several [[field trial]]s with different [[bomblet]] concepts, the end conclusion was that it was no more economical than using [[phosgene]]. This conclusion was based on comparison of the final weapons, rather than ricin's toxicity ([[LD50|LCt<sub>50</sub>]] ~40&nbsp;mg·min/m<sup>3</sup>). Ricin was given the [[chemical weapon designation|military symbol]] '''W''' or later '''WA'''.  Interest in it continued for a short period after World War II, but soon subsided when the [[U.S. Army Chemical Corps]] began a program to weaponize [[sarin]].

The [[Soviet Union]] also possessed weaponized ricin. There were speculations that the [[KGB]] used it outside the Soviet bloc; however, this was never proven. In 1978, the [[Bulgaria]]n dissident [[Georgi Markov]] was assassinated by Bulgarian [[secret police]] who surreptitiously "shot" him on a [[London]] street with a [[Bulgarian umbrella|modified umbrella]] using [[compressed gas]] to fire a tiny pellet contaminated with ricin into his leg.<ref name="Schep"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/01/07/terror.poison.bulgarian/ |title=Ricin and the umbrella murder |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher= CNN | date=January 7, 2003}}</ref> He died in a hospital a few days later; his body was passed to a special poison branch of the [[British MOD|British Ministry of Defence (MOD)]] that discovered the pellet during an [[autopsy]]. The prime suspects were the Bulgarian secret police: Georgi Markov had [[defection|defected]] from Bulgaria some years previously and had subsequently written books and made radio broadcasts which were highly critical of the Bulgarian [[communist regime]]. However, it was believed at the time that Bulgaria would not have been able to produce the pellet, and it was also believed that the KGB had supplied it. The KGB denied any involvement although high-profile KGB defectors [[Oleg Kalugin]] and [[Oleg Gordievsky]] have since confirmed the KGB's involvement. Earlier, Soviet [[dissident]] [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] also suffered (but survived) ricin-like symptoms after an encounter in 1971 with KGB agents.<ref>{{cite book |author=D. M. Thomas |title=Alexander Solzhenitsyn: A Century in His Life |pages=368–378}}</ref>

Given ricin's extreme [[toxicity]] and utility as an agent of chemical/biological warfare, it is noteworthy that the production of the toxin is rather difficult to limit. The [[castor bean]] plant from which ricin is derived is a common [[ornamental plant|ornamental]] and can be grown at home without any special care, and the major reason ricin is a public health threat is that it is easy to obtain.{{Citation needed|reason=A literature search does not reveal an easy way to purify or obtain ricin.|date=January 2012}}

Under both the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] and the 1997 [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], ricin is listed as a [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|schedule 1 controlled substance]]. Despite this, more than 1 million [[tonne]]s of castor beans are processed each year, and approximately 5% of the total is rendered into a [[toxic waste|waste]] containing negligible concentrations of undenatured ricin toxin.<ref name="http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/toxicagents/ricin.html">{{cite web|url=http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/toxicagents/ricin.html |title=Cornell University Department of Animal Science |publisher=Ansci.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref>

Ricin is several [[orders of magnitude]] less toxic than [[botulinum]] or [[Tetanospasmin|tetanus toxin]], but the latter are harder to come by. Compared to [[botulinum]] or [[anthrax]] as [[biological weapon]]s or [[chemical weapon]]s, the quantity of ricin required to achieve LD<sub>50</sub> over a large geographic area is significantly more than an agent such as anthrax (tons of ricin vs. only kilogram quantities of anthrax).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kortepeter, M. G.; Parker, G. W. | year = 1999 | title = Potential biological weapons threats | publisher = U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 523–527 }}</ref> Ricin is easy to produce, but is not as practical nor likely to cause as many casualties as other agents.<ref name="Schep"/> Ricin is inactivated (the [[protein]] changes structure and becomes less dangerous) much more readily than anthrax [[spore]]s, which may remain lethal for decades. Jan van Aken, a Dutch expert on biological weapons, explained in a report for [[The Sunshine Project]] that [[Al Qaeda]]'s experiments with ricin suggest their inability to produce [[botulinum toxin|botulinum]] or anthrax.<ref name="vanaken2001">{{cite web |last=van Aken |first=Jan |year=2001 |url= http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/bk7en.html |title=Biological Weapons: Research Projects of the German Army |work= Backgrounder Series #7 |publisher=[[The Sunshine Project]]}}</ref>

===Incidents involving ricin===
{{main|Incidents involving ricin}}
Ricin has been involved in a number of incidents, including the high-profile assassination of [[Georgi Markov]] in 1978 using [[Bulgarian umbrella|a weapon disguised as an umbrella]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Several terrorists and terrorist groups have experimented with ricin, and several incidents of the poison being mailed to U.S. politicians have occurred in the 21st century.
