'''[[Ankylosing]] [[spondylitis]]''' ('''AS''', from Greek ''ankylos'', crooked; ''spondylos'', vertebrae; ''-itis'', inflammation), previously known as '''Bechterew's disease''', (or syndrome) and '''Marie-Strümpell disease''', is a chronic inflammatory disease of the [[axial skeleton]] with variable involvement of peripheral [[joints]] and nonarticular structures. '''AS''' is a form of [[spondyloarthritis]], a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]], [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[arthritis]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ankylosingspondylitis.html |title=Ankylosing Spondylitis: MedlinePlus |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine  |accessdate=26 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110327194825/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ankylosingspondylitis.html| archivedate= 27 March 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> where [[autoimmune disease|immune]] mechanisms are thought to have a key role.<ref>{{cite journal |author=J Sieper, J Braun, M Rudwaleit, A Boonen, and A Zink |title= Ankylosing spondylitis: an overview |journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=iii8 |year=2002 |pmc=1766729 |doi= 10.1136/ard.61.suppl_3.iii8 |pmid=12381506}}</ref> It mainly affects joints in the [[vertebral column|spine]] and the [[sacroiliac joint]] in the [[pelvis]],  and can cause eventual fusion of the spine.

==History==
[[File:AS trask.jpg|thumb|200pxl|Leonard Trask, the Wonderful Invalid.]]
AS has a long history, having been distinguished from [[rheumatoid arthritis]] by [[Galen]] as early as the second century AD.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dieppe P | title=Did Galen describe rheumatoid arthritis? | journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases | year=1988 | volume=47 | pages=84–87 | doi=10.1136/ard.47.1.84-b | pmid=3278697 | issue=1 | pmc=1003452}}</ref> Skeletal evidence of the disease (ossification of joints and entheses primarily of the axial skeleton, known as "bamboo spine") was found in an archaeological dig that unearthed the skeletal remains of a 5000-year–old Egyptian mummy with evidence of bamboo spine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Calin A |title=Ankylosing spondylitis |journal=Clin Rheum Dis |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=41–60 |year=1985 |month=April |pmid=3158467 }}</ref>

The anatomist and surgeon [[Realdo Colombo]] described what could have been the disease in 1559,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00007632-199504000-00022 |author=Benoist M |title=Pierre Marie.

In 1858, David Tucker published a small booklet which clearly described a patient, [[Leonard Trask]], who suffered from severe spinal deformity subsequent to AS.<ref>{{cite web | title=Life and sufferings of Leonard Trask | url=http://www.HLAB27.com.com/members/life%20and%20sufferings%20of%20leonard%20trask.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=Ankylosing Spondylitis Information Matrix.}}</ref> In 1833, Trask fell from a horse, exacerbating the condition and resulting in severe deformity. Tucker reported:
{{cquote|It was not until he [Trask] had exercised for some time that he could perform any labor.... {H]is neck and back have continued to curve drawing his head downward on his breast.}}
This account became the first documented case of AS in the United States, owing to its indisputable description of inflammatory disease characteristics of AS and the hallmark of deforming injury in AS.

It was not until the late nineteenth century, however, when the [[neurophysiologist]] [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] of Russia in 1893,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bechterew W. | title=Steifigkeit der Wirbelsaule und ihre Verkrummung als besondere Erkrankungsform | journal=Neurol Centralbl | year=1893 | volume=12 | pages=426–434}}</ref> [[Adolph Strümpell]] of Germany in 1897,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Strumpell A. | title=Bemerkung uber die chronische ankylosirende Entzundung der Wirbelsaule und der Huftgelenke | journal=Dtsch Z Nervenheilkd | year=1897 | volume=11 | pages=338–342 | doi=10.1007/BF01674127 | issue=3–4}}</ref> and [[Pierre Marie]] of France in 1898<ref>{{cite journal | author=Marie P. | title=Sur la spondylose rhizomelique | journal=Rev Med | year=1898 | volume=18 | pages=285–315}}</ref> were the first to give adequate descriptions which permitted an accurate diagnosis of AS prior to severe spinal deformity. For this reason, AS is also known as Bekhterev Disease, Bechterew's Disease or Marie–Strümpell Disease.

==Epidemiology==
The overall [[prevalence]] of AS is 0.25 percent, and it is more common in men; three males are diagnosed with AS for every one female. However, many rheumatologists believe the number of women with AS is underdiagnosed, as most women tend to experience milder symptoms.<ref name="ArthritisResearchCampaign">{{cite web |url=http://www.arc.org.uk/arthinfo/patpubs/6001/6001.asp |title=Arthritis Research Campaign – Ankylosing Spondylitis Case History|publisher=Arthritis Research Campaign|year=2009 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}</ref> The majority of AS patients, including 95 percent of white patients, express the [[HLA-B27]] antigen<ref name=Cecil>{{cite book|last1=Goldman|first1=Lee|title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1437727883|year=2011|pages=607|edition=24th}}</ref> and high levels of [[immunoglobulin A]] (IgA) in the blood. The onset of the disease is typically between 15 and 25 years of age.<ref name=Cecil />

The HLA-B27 antigen is also expressed by ''[[Klebsiella]]'' bacteria, which are found in high levels in the [[feces]] of AS patients. A theory suggests the presence of the bacteria may be a trigger of the disease, and reducing the amount of [[starch]] in the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] (which these bacteria require to grow) may be of benefit to AS patients. A test of this diet resulted in reduced symptoms and [[inflammation]] in patients with AS as well as IgA levels in individuals with and without AS.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ebringer A, Wilson C | title = The use of a low starch diet in the treatment of patients suffering from ankylosing spondylitis | journal = Clin Rheumatol | volume = 15 Suppl 1 | pages = 62–66 | year = 1996 | month = 15 Jan | pmid = 8835506}}</ref> Further research is required to determine if diet changes may have a clinical effect on the course of the disease.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Ankylosing process.jpg|thumb|256px|The ankylosis process.]]
Ankylosing [[spondylitis]] (AS) is a systemic rheumatic disease, meaning it affects the entire body. Approximately 90% of AS patients express the [[HLA-B27]] genotype, meaning there is a strong genetic association. However, only 5% of individuals with the HLA-B27 genotype contract the disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reveille JD | title = Major histocompatibility genes and ankylosing spondylitis | journal = Best Practice & Research Clinical Rheumatology | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 601–609 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16777585 | doi = 10.1016/j.berh.2006.03.004}}</ref> [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (TNF α) and [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]] are also implicated in ankylosing spondylitis. Autoantibodies specific for AS have not been identified. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies [[ANCA]] are associated with AS, but do not correlate with disease severity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In a study of 40 patients with AS, ANCA was an infrequent finding, being present in only six patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author = H Locht, T Skogh, and E Kihlström | title = Anti-lactoferrin antibodies and other types of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in reactive arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis | journal = The Journal of Clinical & Experimental Immunology | volume = 117 | issue = 3 | pages = 568–569 | year = 1999 | pmc = 1905360 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2249.1999.01008.x |accessdate=September 24, 2012 | pmid=10469064}}</ref>

The association of AS with HLA-B27 suggests the condition involves CD8 T cells, which interact with HLA-B.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} This interaction is not proven to involve a self antigen, and at least in the related [[Reiter's syndrome]] (reactive arthritis), which follows infections, the antigens involved are likely to be derived from intracellular microorganisms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} There is, however, a possibility that CD4 T cells are involved in an aberrant way, since HLA-B27 appears to have a number of unusual properties, including possibly an ability to interact with T cell receptors in association with CD4 (usually only cytotoxic T lymphocytes with CD8 react with HLAB antigen as it is a MHC class 1 antigen).

In 2001, it was suggested that AS arises from a cross-reaction between HLA-B27 and antigens of the ''[[Klebsiella]]'' bacterial genus.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tiwana H, Natt R, Benitez-Brito R, Shah S, Wilson C, Bridger S, Harbord M, Sarner M, Ebringer A | title = Correlation between the immune responses to collagens type I, III, IV and V and Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients with Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis | journal = Rheumatology (Oxford) | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–23 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11157137 | doi = 10.1093/rheumatology/40.1.15}}</ref> The problem with this idea is that no such cross reactivity with B27 has been found (i.e. although antibody responses to ''Klebsiella'' may be increased, there is no antibody response to B27, so there seems to be no cross reactivity). Some authorities argue that the elimination of the prime nutrients of ''Klebsiella'' (i.e. starches) would decrease antigenemia and improve the musculoskeletal symptoms. However, as Khan (2002) argues, evidence for a correlation between ''Klebsiella'' and AS is circumstantial so far, and the efficacy of low-starch diets has not yet been scientifically evaluated.<ref>{{cite book | author=Khan MA. | year=2002 | title=Ankylosing spondylitis: The facts | publisher= Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-263282-5}}</ref> Studies on low-starch diet and AS could be difficult to fund; new biologics developed by the pharmaceutical industry may demonstrate efficacy, as well as financial benefit to the industry, whereas changing the diet would not. A randomized controlled trial in Turkey demonstrated that 12-week therapy with [[moxifloxacin]] (which would kill Klebsiella) resulted in "significant and sustained improvement" in inflammatory symptoms in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17458395|year=2007|last1=Ogrendik|first1=M|title=Treatment of ankylosing spondylitis with moxifloxacin.|volume=100|issue=4|pages=366–70|journal=Southern Medical Journal}}</ref>

Toivanen (1999) found no support for the role of ''Klebsiella'' in the etiology of primary AS.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Toivanen P, Hansen D, Mestre F, Lehtonen L, Vaahtovuo J, Vehma M, Möttönen T, Saario R, Luukkainen R, Nissilä M | title = Somatic serogroups, capsular types, and species of fecal Klebsiella in patients with ankylosing spondylitis | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 37 | issue = 9 | pages = 2808–12 | date=1 September 1999| pmid = 10449457 | url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/full/37/9/2808?view=long&pmid=10449457 | pmc = 85385}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms appear gradually, usually around 23 years of age.<ref name=Feldtkeller2003/> Initial symptoms are typically [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] pain and stiffness in the middle part of the spine or the entire spine, often with pain referred to one or other buttock or the back of thigh from the [[sacroiliac joint]]. Since the initial signs and symptoms are not specific for ankylosing spondylitis, there is a [[onset-to-diagnosis lag time|lag-time between onset of disease and diagnosis]], which averages between 8.5 years to 11.4 years.<ref name=Feldtkeller2003>{{cite pmid|12634937}}</ref>

About 40 percent of AS patients experience inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye ([[uveitis]]), causing redness, eye pain, [[vision loss]], [[floater]]s and [[photophobia]]. This is thought to be due to the association that both AS and uveitis have with the inheritance of the [[HLA-B27]] antigen. Other common symptoms of AS include: generalized [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] and sometimes nausea. Less commonly, [[aortitis]], [[aortic valve insufficiency]], [[apex of lung|apical]] [[lung fibrosis]] and [[ectasia]] of the sacral nerve root sheaths may occur.

When the condition presents before the age of 18, it is relatively likely to cause pain and swelling of large limb joints, particularly the knee. In prepubescent cases, pain and swelling may also manifest in the ankles and feet, where [[calcaneal spur]]s may also develop. 

Pain is often severe at rest, but improves with physical activity. However, many experience inflammation and pain to varying degrees regardless of rest and movement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Ankylosing spondylitis is one of a cluster of conditions known as [[seronegative]] [[spondyloarthropathies]], in which [[rheumatoid factor]] tests are negative and the characteristic pathological lesion is an inflammation of the [[enthesis]] (the insertion of tensile connective tissue into bone).

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Ankylosing spondylitis lumbar spine.jpg|thumb|Lateral lumbar spine X-ray demonstrating ankylosing spondylitis]]
[[File:M Bechterew2 Spond li ISG MR pcor T1 FatSAT mit GD.jpg|thumb|T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression after administration of gadolinium contrast showing sacroiliitis in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis]]
[[File:Bamboo spine ankylosing spondylitis.jpg|thumb|X-ray showing bamboo spine in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis.]]
[[File:Ankylosing spondylitis.jpg|thumb|CT scan showing Bamboo spine in ankylosing spondylitis]]

There is no direct test to diagnose AS. A clinical examination, MRI and [[X-ray]] studies of the spine, which show characteristic spinal changes and [[Sacroiliac joint|sacroiliitis]], and a simple genetic marker blood test are the major diagnostic tools. A drawback of X-ray diagnosis is the signs and symptoms of AS have usually been established as long as 8–10 years prior to X-ray-evident changes occurring on a plain film X-ray, which means a delay of as long as 10 years before adequate therapies can be introduced. Options for earlier diagnosis are [[Computed tomography|tomography]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] of the sacroiliac joints, but the reliability of these tests is still unclear. The [[Schober's test]] is a useful clinical measure of flexion of the lumbar spine performed during examination.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Thomas E, Silman AJ, Papageorgiou AC, Macfarlane GJ, Croft PR. | title = Association between measures of spinal mobility and low back pain. An analysis of new attenders in primary care | journal = Spine | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 343–7 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9507623 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-199802010-00011}}</ref>

During acute inflammatory periods, AS patients will sometimes show an increase in the blood concentration of [[C-Reactive protein|C-reactive protein]] (CRP) and an increase in the [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR), but there are many with AS whose CRP and ESR rates do not increase, so normal CRP and ESR results do not always correspond with the amount of inflammation that is actually present. In other words, some people with AS have normal levels of CRP and ESR, despite experiencing a significant amount of inflammation in their bodies.

Variations of the HLA-B gene increase the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis, although it is not a diagnostic test. Those with the HLA-B27 variant are at a higher risk than the general population of developing the disorder. HLA-B27, demonstrated in a [[blood test]], can occasionally help with diagnosis, but in itself is not diagnostic of AS in a person with back pain. Over 95% of people that have been diagnosed with AS are HLA-B27 positive, although this ratio varies from population to population (only 50% of African American patients with AS possess HLA-B27, and it is close to 80% among AS patients from Mediterranean countries). In early onset disease HLA-B7/B*2705 heterozygotes exhibited the highest risk for disease.<ref name="pmid18578977">{{cite journal |author=Harjacek M, Margetić T, Kerhin-Brkljacić V, Martinez N, Grubić Z |title=HLA-B*27/HLA-B*07 in combination with D6S273-134 allele is associated with increased susceptibility to juvenile spondyloarthropathies |journal=Clin.

The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index ([[BASDAI]]), developed in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (UK), is an index designed to detect the inflammatory burden of active disease. The BASDAI can help to establish a diagnosis of AS in the presence of other factors such as HLA-B27 positivity, persistent buttock pain which resolves with exercise, and X-ray or MRI evident involvement of the sacroiliac joints. (See: "Diagnostic Tools", below)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Garrett S, Jenkinson T, Kennedy L, Whitelock H, Gaisford P, Calin A | title = A new approach to defining disease status in ankylosing spondylitis: the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index | journal = J Rheumatol | volume = 21 | issue = 12 | pages = 2286–91 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7699630}}</ref> It can be easily calculated and accurately assesses a patient's need for additional therapy; a patient with a score of four out of a possible 10 points while on adequate NSAID therapy is usually considered a good candidate for biologic therapy.

The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is a functional index which can accurately assess a patient's functional impairment due to the disease, as well as improvements following therapy. (See: "Diagnostic Tools", below)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Calin A, Garrett S, Whitelock H, Kennedy L, O'Hea J, Mallorie P, Jenkinson T | title = A new approach to defining functional ability in ankylosing spondylitis: the development of the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index | journal = J Rheumatol | volume = 21 | issue = 12 | pages = 2281–5 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7699629}}</ref> The BASFI is not usually used as a diagnostic tool, but rather as a tool to establish a patient's current baseline and subsequent response to therapy.

==Treatment==
Physical therapy and exercise, along with medication, are at the heart of therapy for ankylosing spondylitis. Physiotherapy and physical exercises are preceded by medical treatment to reduce the inflammation and pain, and are commonly followed by a physician. This way the movements will help in diminishing pain and stiffness, while exercise in an active inflammatory state would just make the pain worse. Normal occupations may be precluded by the symptoms of the disease.

Some may require the help of walking aids, such as a cane, to help assist in balance and relieve some pressure on affected joints while walking and standing. Many with AS find it very difficult to sit or stand for prolonged periods of time, which can be as little as 20 minutes; therefore, many need to alternate times of sitting and standing, as well as times of rest.

Medical professionals and experts in AS have speculated that maintaining good posture can reduce the likelihood of a fused or curved spine which occurs in a significant percentage of diagnosed persons.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ankylosing Spondylitis, Treatment Options |publisher=Arthritis Foundation (arthritis.org)|year=2010

===Medication===
The major types of medications used to treat ankylosing spondylitis are pain-relievers and drugs aimed at stopping or slowing the progression of the disease. Pain-relieving drugs come in two major classes:
*[[Anti-inflammatory drugs]], which include [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]]s such as [[ibuprofen]], [[phenylbutazone]], [[diclofenac]], [[indomethacin]], [[naproxen]] and [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s, which reduce inflammation and pain. 2012 research showed that patients with elevated [[Acute-phase proteins|acute phase reactant]]s seem to benefit most from continuous treatment with NSAIDs.<ref name="pmid22532639">{{cite journal | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22532639 | pmid = 22532639 | doi=10.1136/annrheumdis-2012-201370 | volume=71 | issue=10 | title=Continuous NSAID use reverts the effects of inflammation on radiographic progression in patients with ankylosing spondylitis | year=2012 | month=October | author=Kroon F, Landewé R, Dougados M, van der Heijde D | journal=Ann. Rheum. Dis. | pages=1623–9}}</ref>

*[[Opioid|Opioid analgesics]], which are addictive and not generally prescribed. 

Drugs used to treat the progression of the disease include:
*[[Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug]]s (DMARDs) such as [[cyclosporin]], [[methotrexate]], [[sulfasalazine]], and [[corticosteroids]], are used to reduce the immune system response through [[immunosuppression]];

*[[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (TNFα) blockers ([[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]]), such as the [[biologic medical product|biologics]] [[etanercept]], [[infliximab]], [[golimumab]] and [[adalimumab]], have shown good short-term effectiveness and trials are ongoing to determine their long-term effectiveness and safety.<ref>{{DOI|10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60635-7}}</ref> One drawback is the cost.
*[[Anti-IL-6|Anti-interleukin-6]] inhibitors such as [[Tocilizumab]], currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Henes|first=Joerg|coauthors=Horger, Guenaydin, Kanz, Koetter|title=Mixed response to tocilizumab for ankylosing spondylitis|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|year=2010|month=February|volume=69|issue=12|pages=2217–2218|pmid=20851032|doi=10.1136/ard.2009.126706}}</ref> and [[rituximab]], a monoclonal antibody against CD20, are also undergoing trials.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/rheumatology/ken362|title=The use of rituximab to treat a patient with ankylosing spondylitis and hepatitis B|year=2008|last1=Rodriguez-Escalera|first1=C.|last2=Fernandez-Nebro|first2=A.|journal=Rheumatology|volume=47|issue=11|pages=1732–1733|pmid=18786966}}</ref>

===Surgery===
In severe cases of AS, surgery can be an option in the form of joint replacements, particularly in the knees and hips. Surgical correction is also possible for those with severe flexion deformities (severe downward curvature) of the spine, particularly in the neck, although this procedure is considered very risky.

In addition, AS can have some manifestations which make anaesthesia more complex. Changes in the upper airway can lead to difficulties in intubating the airway, spinal and epidural anaesthesia may be difficult owing to calcification of ligaments, and a small number of patients have [[aortic insufficiency]]. The stiffness of the thoracic ribs results in ventilation being mainly diaphragm-driven, so there may also be a decrease in pulmonary function.

===Physical therapy===
Some of the therapies that have been shown to benefit AS patients include: {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* [[Physical therapy]]/[[osteopathy]]/[[physiotherapy]], shown to be of great benefit to AS patients;
* Swimming, one of the preferred exercises since it involves all muscles and joints in a low-impact, buoyant environment;
* Slow movement muscle extending exercises like [[stretching]], [[yoga]], climbing, [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], [[Pilates|Pilates method]], etc.

Moderate-to-high impact exercises like [[jogging]] are generally not recommended or recommended with restrictions due to the jarring of affected vertebrae that can worsen pain and stiffness in some patients.

==Prognosis==
AS can range from mild to progressively debilitating and from medically controlled to refractory. Some have times of active inflammation followed by times of remission, while others never have times of remission and have acute inflammation and pain.

Unattended cases of AS accompanied by [[dactylitis]] or [[enthesitis]], especially when spine inflammation is not yet active, may result in a misdiagnosis of normal rheumatism. In a long-term undiagnosed period, [[osteopenia]] or [[osteoporosis]] of the AP spine may occur, causing eventual compression fractures and a back "hump". Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of [[syndesmophyte]]s on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to [[osteophyte]]s affecting the spine. The fusion of the vertebrae [[paresthesia]] is a complication due to the inflammation of the tissue surrounding nerves.

Organs commonly affected by AS, other than the axial [[vertebral column|spine]] and other joints, are the [[heart]], [[lung]]s, [[Human eye|eyes]], [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], and [[kidney]]s.

==Research==
In 2007, a collaborative effort by an international team of researchers in the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States led to the discovery of two genes that also contribute to the cause of AS: [[ARTS-1]] and [[Interleukin 23|IL23R]]. The findings were published in the November 2007 edition of Nature Genetics, a journal that emphasizes research on the genetic basis for common and complex diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brionez TF, Reveille JD |title=The contribution of genes outside the major histocompatibility complex to susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis |journal=Curr Opin Rheumatol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=384–91 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18525349 |doi=10.1097/BOR.0b013e32830460fe}}</ref> Together with HLA-B27, these two genes account for roughly 70 percent of the overall incidence of the disease.
