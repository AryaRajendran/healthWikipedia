'''World AIDS Day''', observed on 1 December every year, is dedicated to raising awareness of the [[AIDS pandemic]] caused by the spread of HIV infection. Government and health officials observe the day, often with speeches or forums on the AIDS topics. Since 1995, the President of the United States has made an official [[List of observances in the United States by presidential proclamation|proclamation]] on World AIDS Day. Governments of other nations have followed suit and issued similar announcements.

AIDS has killed more than 25 million people between 1981 and 2007,<ref>[http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/HIVData/GlobalReport/2008/2008_Global_report.asp Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), ''Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic 2008,'' (Geneva, Switzerland: UNAIDS, July 2008; English original), p. 15.]</ref> and an estimated 33.2 million people worldwide live with HIV as of 2007,<ref>[http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/HIVData/GlobalReport/2008/2008_Global_report.asp Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), ''Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic 2008,'' (Geneva, Switzerland: UNAIDS, July 2008; English original), p. 32.]</ref> making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.

==History==
[[File:AidsRusStamp1993.jpg|thumb|left|208px|Russian stamp, 1993]]
World AIDS Day was first conceived in August 1987 by James W. Bunn and Thomas Netter, two public information officers for the Global Programme on AIDS at the [World Health Organization] in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, International News, "World AIDS Day Co-Founder Looks Back 20 Years Later", CDC HIV/Hepatitis/STD/TB Prevention News Update, 12 December 2007</ref><ref>"AIDS Day Co-Founder Looks Back after 20 Years" By Rose Hoban, Voice of America, 6 December 2007</ref>  Bunn and Netter took their idea to Dr. Jonathan Mann, Director of the Global Programme on AIDS (now known as [[UNAIDS]]).  Dr. Mann liked the concept, approved it, and agreed with the recommendation that the first observance of World AIDS Day should be 1 December 1988.

Bunn, a broadcast journalist on a leave-of-absence from his reporting duties at KPIX-TV in San Francisco, recommended the date of 1 December believing it would maximize coverage by western news media.  Since 1988 was an election year in the U.S., Bunn suggested that media outlets would be weary of their post-election coverage and eager to find a fresh story to cover.  Bunn and Netter determined that 1 December was long enough after the election and soon enough before the Christmas holidays that it was, in effect, a dead spot in the news calendar and thus perfect timing for World AIDS Day.

On 18 June 1986 KPIX'S “AIDS Lifeline" (a community education project initiated by Bunn and KPIX Special Projects Producer Nancy Saslow) was honored with a Presidential Citation for Private Sector Initiatives presented by President Ronald Reagan.  Because of his role in "AIDS Lifeline" Bunn was asked by Dr. Mann, on behalf of the U.S. government, to take a two-year leave-of-absence to join Dr. Mann, an epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control, and assist in the creation of the Global Programme on AIDS for the United Nations' World Health Organization.  Mr. Bunn accepted and was named the first Public Information Officer for the Global Programme on AIDS.  Bunn and Netter conceived, designed, and implemented the inaugural World AIDS Day observance – now the longest-running disease awareness and prevention initiative of its kind in the history of public health.

The [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS) became operational in 1996, and it took over the planning and promotion of World AIDS Day.<ref name="Speicher">[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/130044.php Speicher, Sara. "World AIDS Day Marks 20th Anniversary Of Solidarity." ''Medical News Today.'' 19 November 2008.]</ref> Rather than focus on a single day, UNAIDS created the World AIDS Campaign in 1997 to focus on year-round communications, prevention and education.<ref name="Speicher" /><ref name="Soest">[http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/Resources/FeatureStories/archive/2006/20061020_Interview_Marcel_van_Soest.asp van Soest, Marcel. "Accountability: Main Message on World AIDS Day." Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. 20 Oct 2006.]</ref>

In its first two years, the theme of World AIDS Day focused on children and young people. These themes were strongly criticized at the time for ignoring the fact that people of all ages may become infected with HIV and suffer from AIDS.<ref name="Speicher" /> But the themes drew attention to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, helped alleviate some of the stigma surrounding the disease, and helped boost recognition of the problem as a family disease.<ref name="Speicher" />

In 2004, the World AIDS Campaign became an independent organization.<ref name="Speicher" /><ref name="Soest" /><ref>''Yearbook of the United Nations 2005.'' Vol. 59
Geneva, Switzerland: United Nations Publications, 2007. ISBN 92-1-100967-7</ref>

Each year, Popes [[John Paul II]] and [[Benedict XVI]] have released a greeting message for patients and doctors on World AIDS Day.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/1988/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19881128_aids_it.html First World AIDS Day in 1988]</ref><ref>[http://www.healthpastoral.org/text.php?cid=267&sec=4&docid=21&lang=en Message for the World AIDS Day]</ref><ref>[http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=4758 Pope: "I feel near to people with AIDS and their families"]</ref><ref>[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:65e95Hr5YywJ:data.unaids.org/pub/PressStatement/2006/World%2520AIDS%2520Day%2520-%2520CI%2520Statement%25202006%2520-%2520Eng.pdf+aids+day+pope+2006&hl=en&gl=ca&sig=AHIEtbT8DSFpREHZcQo4yw6rDo64M8Xw8w Message of Caritas Internationalis On Occasion of World AIDS Day 2006]</ref><ref>[http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2007/11/30/pope-skirts-condoms-issue-in-world-aids-day-statement/ Pope skirts condoms issue in World AIDS Day statement]</ref><ref>[http://www.worldaidscampaign.org/en/Constituencies/Faith/Annoucements/Message-from-the-Pope-on-World-AIDS-Day Message from the Pope on World AIDS Day]</ref>

In 2007, the [[White House]] began marking World AIDS Day with the iconic display of a 28-foot AIDS Ribbon on the building's North Portico.<ref>"Two-Story AIDS Ribbon at White House," ABC News, Nov. 30, 2007, http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2007/11/the-2-story-tal/</ref> The display, now an annual tradition, quickly garnered attention, as it was the first banner, sign or symbol to prominently hang from the White House since the [[Abraham Lincoln]] administration.

==Choosing the theme==
From its inception until 2004, [[UNAIDS]] spearheaded the World AIDS Day campaign, choosing annual themes in consultation with other global health organizations.

As of 2008, each year's World AIDS Day theme is chosen by the World AIDS Campaign's Global Steering Committee after extensive consultation with people, organizations and government agencies involved in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.<ref name="Speicher" /> For each World AIDS Day from 2005 through 2010, the theme was "Stop AIDS. Keep the Promise.", with a yearly sub-theme.<ref name="Speicher" /> This overarching theme is designed to encourage political leaders to keep their commitment to achieve universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care, and support by the year 2010.<ref name="Speicher" />

This theme is not specific to World AIDS Day, but is used year-round in WAC's efforts to highlight HIV/AIDS awareness within the context of other major global events including the [[G8 Summit]]. World AIDS Campaign also conducts "in-country" campaigns throughout the world, like the [[Student Stop AIDS Campaign]], an infection-awareness campaign targeting young people throughout the UK.
