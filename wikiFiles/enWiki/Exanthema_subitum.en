'''Exanthema subitum''' (meaning ''sudden rash''), also referred to as '''roseola infantum''' (or '''rose rash of infants'''), '''sixth disease''' (as the sixth [[exanthem|rash-causing childhood disease]]), and (confusingly) '''baby measles''', or '''three-day fever''', is a disease of children, generally under two years old,<ref name="pmid15728809">{{cite journal |author=Zerr DM, Meier AS, Selke SS, ''et al.'' |title=A population-based study of primary human herpesvirus 6 infection |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=352 |issue=8 |pages=768–76 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15728809 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa042207 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/352/8/768}}</ref> although it has been known to occur in eighteen-year-olds, whose manifestations are usually limited to a transient rash ("[[exanthem]]") that occurs following a fever of about three day's duration.

It is caused by two human [[herpesvirus]]es, HHV-6 (''[[Human herpesvirus 6]]'') and HHV-7, which are sometimes referred to collectively as [[Roseolovirus]]. There are two variants of HHV-6 (HHV-6a and HHV-6b) and studies in the US, Europe, Dubai and Japan have shown that exanthema subitum is caused by HHV-6b. This form of HHV-6 infects over 90% of infants by age 2. Research has shown that babies can be congenitally infected with HHV-6 via [[vertical transmission]].<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14658-universal-childhood-virus-is-inherited-in-dna.html ''Universal childhood virus is inherited in DNA''], newscientist.com</ref> This has been shown to occur in 1% of births in the United States.<ref name="pmid206" >{{cite pmid|20648610|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|21397473|noedit}}</ref>

== Clinical features ==
Typically the disease affects a child between six months and two years of age, and begins with a sudden high [[fever]] (39–40 °C; 102.2-104 °F). This can cause, in rare cases, febrile convulsions (also known as [[febrile seizure]]s or "fever fits") due to the sudden rise in body temperature, but in many cases the child appears normal. After a few days the fever subsides, and just as the child appears to be recovering, a red rash appears. This usually begins on the trunk, spreading to the legs and neck. The rash is not itchy and may last 1 to 2 days.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/tc/roseola-topic-overview ''Roseola – Topic Overview''], webmd.com</ref> In contrast, a child suffering from [[measles]] would usually appear more infirm, with symptoms of [[conjunctivitis]], [[coryza]], and a cough, and their rash would affect the face and last for several days. Liver dysfunction can occur in rare cases.

The rare adult reactivates with HHV-6 and can show signs of [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]].<ref name="pmid10774474">{{cite journal |author=Stoeckle MY |title=The spectrum of human herpesvirus 6 infection: from roseola infantum to adult disease |journal=Annu.

==Vaccines and treatment==
There is no specific [[vaccine]] against or treatment for exanthema subitum, and most children with the disease are not seriously ill. A child with [[fever]] should be given plenty of fluids to drink. [[Paracetamol]]/[[acetaminophen]] or [[ibuprofen]] could be given to reduce their temperature (but never [[aspirin]], due to the risk of [[Reye's Syndrome]]<ref>[http://www.reyessyndrome.org/aspirin.htm ''What is the role of aspirin?''], reyessyndrome.org</ref>).

A small percent of children acquire HHV-6 "subclinically"; in other words, they show no outward sign of the disease. Exanthema subitum occurs in approximately 30% of children during primary HHV-6 infection.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMoa042207|noedit}}</ref> Others may be debilitated enough that a doctor's opinion is required to confirm the diagnosis, and particularly to rule out other more serious infections, such as [[meningitis]] or [[measles]]. In case of [[febrile seizure]]s, medical advice is essential.

For HHV-6 infection, no pharmacological treatments have been approved as of June 2012. Although they may be unnecessary for exanthema subitum, the usage of ''Cytomegalovirus'' treatments ([[valganciclovir]], [[ganciclovir]],<ref name="Nakano 2009">{{cite pmid|19559728|noedit}}</ref> [[cidofovir]], and [[foscarnet]]) have shown some success.<ref name="pmid206" /> These drugs are given with the intent of inhibiting proper DNA polymerization by competing with deoxy triphosphate nucleotides<ref name="Nakano 2009"/> or specifically inactivating viral DNA polymerases.<ref>{{cite pmid|20404187|noedit}}</ref>
