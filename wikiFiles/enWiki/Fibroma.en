'''Fibromas''' (or '''fibroid tumors''' or '''fibroids''') are [[benign]] [[tumor]]s that are composed of fibrous or [[connective tissue]]. They can grow in all organs, arising from [[mesenchyme]]  tissue. The term "[[fibroblast]]ic" or "fibromatous" is used to describe tumors of the [[fibrous connective tissue]]. When the term ''fibroma'' is used without modifier, it is usually considered [[benign]], with the term [[fibrosarcoma]] reserved for [[malignant]] tumors.

==Hard fibroma==
The hard fibroma (fibroma durum) consists of many fibres and few cells, e.g. in skin it is called [[dermatofibroma]] (fibroma simplex or nodulus cutaneous).  A special form is the [[keloid]], which derives from hyperplastic growth of [[scars]].

==Soft fibroma==
The soft fibroma (fibroma molle) or fibroma with a shaft (acrochordon, skin tag, fibroma pendulans) consist of many loosely connected cells and less fibroid tissue. It mostly appears at the neck, armpits or groin. The photo shows a soft fibroma of the eyelid.

==Other types of fibroma==
The fibroma cavernosum or [[angiofibroma]], consists of many often dilated vessels, it is a vasoactive tumor occurring almost exclusively in adolescent males.

The cystic fibroma (fibroma cysticum) has central softening or dilated [[lymphatic vessels]]. 

The myxofibroma (fibroma myxomatodes) is produced by liquefaction of the underlying [[soft tissue]]. 

The cemento-ossifying fibroma is hard and fibrous, most frequently seen in the [[jaw]] or [[mouth]], sometimes in connection with a [[fracture]] or another type of [[injury]]. 

Other fibromas: [[chondromyxoid fibroma]], [[desmoplasmic fibroma]], [[nonossifying fibroma]], [[ossifying fibroma]], [[nuchal fibroma]], [[collagenous fibroma]], [[fibroma of tendon sheath]], perifollicular fibroma, pleomorphic fibroma, [[uterine fibroma]],  etc.

The [[Neurofibroma]]

===Ovarian fibroma===
{{Main|Ovarian fibroma}}
It appears in the [[sex cord-stromal tumour]] group of [[Ovarian cancer|ovarian neoplasm]]s. Ovary fibromas are most frequent during [[middle age]], and rare in [[children]].
Upon gross [[pathology|pathological]] inspection, ovary fibromas are firm and white or tan.
Variants with [[edema]] are especially likely to be associated with [[Meigs' syndrome]].
On [[Microscope|microscopic]] examination, there are intersecting bundles of [[spindle cell]]s producing [[collagen]].

There may be [[thecoma]]tous areas ([[fibrothecoma]]).  The presence of an ovarian fibroma can cause [[ovarian torsion]] in some cases.

==Treatment==
Benign fibromas can be removed or left alone. Removal is usually a brief outpatient procedure.
