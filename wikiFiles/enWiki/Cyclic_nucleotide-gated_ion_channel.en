'''Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels''' or '''CNG channels''' are [[ion channel]]s that function in response to the binding of [[cyclic nucleotide]]s. CNG channels are [[nonselective]] [[cation]] channels that are found in the membranes of various tissue and cell types, and are significant in [[Transduction (physiology)|sensory transduction]] as well as cellular development. Their function can be the result of a combination of the binding of cyclic nucleotides (cGMP and cAMP) and either a [[depolarization]] or a [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] event. Initially discovered in the cells that make up the [[retina]] of the eye, CNG channels have been found in many different cell types across both the [[animal]] and the [[plant]] [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. CNG channels have a very complex structure with various [[protein subunit|subunits]] and [[protein domain|domains]] that play a critical role in their function. CNG channels are significant in the function of various sensory pathways including [[visual system|vision]] and [[olfaction]], as well as in other key cellular functions such as [[hormone]] release and [[chemotaxis]].

== Discovery ==
The discovery of CNG channels is related to the discovery of [[intracellular]] messengers responsible for the mediation of responses in retinal [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]].  Before their discovery, it was thought that [[cyclic nucleotides]] played a role in [[phosphorylation]]. In 1985, it was discovered that [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] was able to directly activate the light-dependent response of [[Rod cell|rod]] [[ion channel]]s by studying light-adapted [[retina]] of frogs.<ref name= "discovery">{{cite journal | author = Fesenko EE, Kolesnikov SS, Lyubarsky AL | title = Induction by cyclic GMP of cationic conductance in plasma membrane of retinal rod outer segment | journal = Nature | volume = 313 | issue = 6000 | pages = 310–3 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2578616 | doi = 10.1038/313310a0 }}</ref> CNG channels were also found in [[cone cell|cone]] photoreceptors, chemo sensitive [[cilia]] of [[olfactory receptor neuron|olfactory sensory neurons]], and the [[pineal gland]].

== Function ==
CNG channels have important functions in [[signal transduction]] in [[retinal]] photoreceptors and [[olfactory receptor neurons]]. They are directly activated by cyclic nucleotides, and approximately 4 cyclic nucleotides are needed to activate each channel. CNG channels are nonselective and allow many [[alkali]] ions to flow into or out of a cell expressing CNG channels on its membrane. This flow of ions can result in either [[depolarization]] or [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]]. CNG channels can be activated by [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] or [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] exclusively, or sometimes by a combination of both cNMPs, and some channels are more selective than others. Even though the activity of these channels show little voltage dependence, they are still considered voltage-dependent channels. [[Calcium]], [[calmodulin]], and [[phosphorylation]] modulate the opening of CNG channels.<ref name="photoreceptors"/>

The main role of CNG channels is sensory [[Signal transduction|transduction]] in various tissues. Many studies have shown CNG channels in [[rod cell|rod]] and [[cone cell|cone]] photoreceptors, and they have also been found in the [[brain]], the [[heart]], the [[kidney]]s, and [[human gonad|gonads]].<ref name="photoreceptors"/>

CNG channel [[Homologous chromosome|homologs]] in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', and ''[[Limulus polyphemus]]'' have unknown functions. Studies have shown homologs in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' might have functions in [[chemoreceptor|chemosensation]].<ref name="photoreceptors"/>

[[Color blindness]] and retinal degeneration result when CNG channels have mutations. [[Mutations]] specifically in the subunits A and B result in complete and incomplete [[achromatopsia]].<ref name="photoreceptors"/>

==Structure==
A CNG channel consists of four [[protein subunit|subunits]] around a central [[Ion channel pore|pore]]. Each protein subunit consists 6 [[Transmembrane protein|transmembrane]] segments (S1-S6), a [[Walker motifs|P-loop]], intracellular [[N-terminus|amino terminal]] region, and [[C-terminus|carboxy terminal]] region. The P-loop and S6 segments around the pore, which plays a role in ion conduction.  There is a cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) and connection region to the S6 segment in the carboxy terminal.  There is a post-CNDB region in the [[amino terminal]].<ref name= "photoreceptors2">{{cite journal |last1=Matulef |first1= Kimberly |last2=Zagotta |first2=William N. |title=Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Ion Channels |journal=Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology |volume=19 |pages=23–44 |year=2003 |pmid= 14570562 |doi=10.1146/annurev.cellbio.19.110701.154854}}</ref>

===Alpha subunits===
Cyclic nucleotide gated channel alpha-subunits include 
*[[Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 1]]
*[[Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 2]]
*[[Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 3]]
*[[Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 4]]

===Beta subunits===
Cyclic nucleotide gated channel beta-subunits include:
*[[Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel beta 1]]
*[[Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel beta 3]]

===Pore===
The structure of the pore is similar to other ion channels that contain P-loops. The P-loop enters the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] of the pore from the extracellular side and exits to the [[intracellular]] side. The P loop enters as an alpha helix and exists as an uncoiled strand. Helices that cover the [[inner membrane]] line the channel. These also form a 6 [[helix bundle]] that signifies the entrance. In order to open the pore, a [[conformational change]] must occur in the inner 6 helix bundle.<ref name="photoreceptors2"/>

===Cyclic nucleotide binding domain===
A [[Cyclic nucleotide-binding domain]] is an intracellular domain located in the [[C-terminus]] region and has a similar sequence to other cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins. The domain is believed to be made up of a [[beta sheet|β-pleated sheet]] and two [[α-helices]]. The β-pleated sheet is made up of eight [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] strands. The α helices are named the B and C helices. A [[ligand]] initially binds to the β-pleated sheet, and through [[allosteric regulation]] causes the movement to an α-helix toward the β-pleated sheet. The α-helix is flexible in closed channels. When an α-helix of a [[Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 1|CNGA1]] subunit is in close proximity to another α-helix, they form intersubunit [[disulfide bonds]]. This occurs mainly in closed channels, inhibiting movement of the α-helix towards the β-pleated sheet. When a ligand binds to the β-pleated sheet, this bound cyclic nucleotide stabilizes the movement of the α-helix toward the β-pleated sheet in each subunit, pulling the α-helices away from each other.<ref name="photoreceptors2"/>

[[File:PDB 1wgp EBI.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a '''cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel''' with a cAMP binding domain.]]

===C-linker===
The C-linker is a region that connects the CNBD to the S6 segment. The C-linker region contributes to the contact between channel subunits as well as promotes tetramerization, the forming of [[tetramers]]. There are many [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]] that play a role in modulation of CNG channels. This process uses metals such as [[nickel]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], and [[magnesium]]. The C-linker region is involved in the coupling of ligand binding to the opening of the pore. The C linker region forms [[disulfide bonds]] with N-terminal regions. Disulfide bonds alter the channel function therefore they most likely lie close to the [[tertiary structure]]. Disulfide bonds decrease the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the open state compared to the closed state. 
The specific [[cysteine]] residue C481 on the C-linker region is located only a few amino acids away from the [[binding domain]]. In the closed state C481 is nonreactive; C481 must undergo a [[conformational change]] so that it is accessible for the opening of the channel. Disulfide bonds form between neighboring subunits and C481. Simultaneously there is a C35 cysteine residue at the [[N-terminal]] of the C-linker region that can reach two C481 residues, making a favorable disulfide bond compared to a C481-C481 bond.<ref name="photoreceptors2"/>
<ref name="blueprints"/>

===S6 region===
Spontaneous [[disulfide bond]] formation is state-dependent, implying that the [[conformational change]] in the helix bundle is affiliated with channel gating. 
When the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels are closed, the cytoplasmic ends of the S6 helices are in close proximity to each other. Small [[cations]] are able to move through an opening, which implies that the gate is beyond the [[helix bundle]] and that S6 helices are in conjunction with conformational changes in the selectivity filter.<ref name="blueprints"/>

===P region===
The P region forms a loop, a [[phosphate]]-binding loop, connecting the S5 and S6 regions which extend to the central axis of the channel. Ionic properties are determined by the residues in the loop between S5 and S6 [[transmembrane]] segments. The P region dictates the ion selectivity of the cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel, which also determine the pore diameter of CNG channels. The P region functions as a channel gate since it prevents ion permeation in the closed state. The pore may be hindered by small conformational changes in this region. The P region acts as an ion selectivity filter that changes structure in the open conformation. In the open state, four identical subunits contribute a single P-loop region, which forms a selectivity filter.<ref name="blueprints"/>

== CNG channel family ==
In vertebrates, the CNG channel gene family consists of six members. These genes are divided based on sequence similarity into two subtypes CNGA and CNGB. Additional genes that code for CNG channels have been cloned from ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' and ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''. A subunit of a CNG channel [[CNGA1]], previously called the rod α subunit, was expressed in rod photoreceptors and produced functional channels that were gated by [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]]  when expressed externally in either ''Xenopus'' oocytes or in a human [[embryo]]nic kindney cell line ([[HEK cell|HEK293]]). In humans, mutated CNGA1 genes result in an [[recessive|autosomal recessive]] form of [[retinitis pigmentosa]], a degenerative form of blindness. [[CNGB1]], previously called the rod β subunit, is a second subunit of the rod channel. Unlike CNGA1, CNGB1 subunits expressed alone do not produce functional CNG channels, but coexpression of CNGA1 and CNGB1 subunits produces [[heteromer]]ic channels with modulation, [[permeation]], [[pharmacology]], and cyclic-nucleotide specificity comparable to that of native channels.<ref name= "pdfarticle"/>

CNG channels form [[tetramers]], and recent studies indicate that native rod channels consist of three CNGA1 subunits and one CNGB1 subunit. [[CNGA3]] subunits, previously called the cone α subunits, form functional channels when its expression occurs exogenously. On the other hand, [[CNGB3]], previously called the cone β subunit, does not. Mutations in human CNGA3 and CNGB3 are involved in complete [[achromatopsia]], which is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited and [[congenital disorder]] characterized by the complete failure in color distinction.<ref name= "pdfarticle"/>

[[CNGA2]], previously called the olfactory α subunit and [[CNGA4]], previously called the olfactory β subunit, are involved in transduction of [[aroma compound|odorant]] signals in olfactory neurons for which the subunit [[stoichiometry]] and arrangement are unknown.<ref name= "pdfarticle">{{cite journal | author = Matulef K, Zagotta WN | title = Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels | journal = Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 23–44 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14570562 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.19.110701.154854 | url = }}</ref>

In [[invertebrate]]s, a CNG channel subunit called CNG-P1 has been cloned from ''D. melanogaster'' and is expressed in [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] and the visual system, an indication that CNG channels may be linked to the transduction of light in invertebrates. A second putative CNG-like subunit called CNGL, cloned from ''D. melanogaster'', is found to be expressed in the brain. Two CNG channel subunits, Tax-2 and Tax-4, have been cloned in ''C. elegans'' and are responsible for chemosensation, [[Thermoception|thermosensation]], and normal [[axon]] outgrowth of some sensory neurons in ''C. elegans''.<ref name="pdfarticle"/>

==The binding event ==
The ligand might be placed at the bottom of the cavity due to interactions with the phosphate binding cassette (PBC).  This cavity refers to a region in the CNBD formed by the β roll, a two-looped [[Beta helix|β helix]]. Changes induced by ligand binding occur in α helices (αA, αB, and αC and PBC helix). The β roll only undergoes small changes during binding. After the ligand is seated, αB and αC helices arrange themselves so that they form a cap over the cavity. How binding affects the αA helix is still unclear.

===Cooperative and non-cooperative activation===
The steep concentration between CNG channels and ligand concentration shows that at least two or three cyclic nucleotides are needed.  It is believed that the second ligand is required for the channel to transition from closed to open. When the third and fourth ligands bind, the open state of the channel becomes stabilized.<ref name="cooperative"/>
In bacteria, the opening CNG channels is the result of non-cooperative binding.<ref name="cooperative"/>
With differing concentrations of ligands, [[cooperative binding]] and non-cooperative binding arise to adapt to these differing environments. At low ligand concentrations, it is rare for a ligand to cooperatively bind, because cooperative binding at low concentrations weakens the binding between channel and ligand, reducing channel sensitivity.<ref name="cooperative"/>

== Ligand selectivity ==
By measuring the currents activated in excised inside-out membrane patches upon superfusion with varying [[ligand]] concentrations, the ligand sensitivity and selectivity of both [[Endogeny|endogenously]] and [[exogeny|exogenously]] expressed CNG channels have been studied. All native CNG channels react to both [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] and [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]], but smaller concentrations of cGMP than of cAMP are needed to activate and open the channels. CNG channels are sharply selective between cGMP and cAMP in rods and cones, whereas in OSNs, the channels respond equally well to both ligands. CNG channels found in OSNs are much more sensitive to both cGMP and cAMP than photoreceptor CNG channels. Studies of [[dose-response relationship|dose response relations]] showed that channel activation is greatly dependent on cGMP concentration; several cGMP molecules bind to the channel in a cooperative manner. Since each subunit contains a single cNMP-binding site, and [[homomeric]] and [[heteromeric]] channels most likely form a [[tetramer]]ic complex, a maximum of four ligand molecules can bind to the channel.
Selectivity can be achieved by differential control of the [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for binding of the ligand, efficacy of gating, or a combination of both. Binding affinity means how tightly cyclic nucleotides bind to the channel. Efficacy refers to the ability of ligand to activate and open the channel once it is bound. Although these processes are useful in understanding selectivity, they are inextricably coupled to each other that it is very difficult to experimentally separate one from another.<ref name= "photoreceptors"/>

CNG channels do not discriminate between [[sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] and [[potassium|K<sup>+</sup>]] ions, and they also allow [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] and [[magnesium|Mg<sup>2+</sup>]] to pass through, although at a slower rate. The passage of these [[divalent]] ions inhibit the current carried by Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. A highly conserved residue of [[glutamic acid]] in the selectivity filter of CNG channels has been found to form a high-affinity binding site for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, a bacterial nonselective cation channel called the NaK channel hosts a selectivity filter sequence similar to that of CNG channels. In the [[crystal structure]] of the NaK channel, a discrete Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site at the extracellular opening of the pore has been identified.<ref name="cooperative"/>

==Inhibition of CNG channels ==
 
Studies have shown the differential inhibition of CNG channels by [[Diglyceride|diacylglycerol]] (DAG) in [[Xenopus]] [[oocytes]].  DAG can be used as a closed state inhibitor.  Using DAG to inhibit homomultimeric rod channels, or those that contain two or more identical [[peptide|peptide chains]], was similar to the inhibition of native rod channels. Using DAG to inhibit the homomultimeric olfactory channels was not as effective, even with a high concentration of DAG. More than one molecule of DAG is needed to inhibit a channel effectively.  DAG molecules position themselves to stabilize the close state of a CNG channel, by binding to the channel or by changing the interaction between the [[lipid bilayer]]of the [[cell membrane]] and the channel.  Studies with [[chimeras]]{{disambiguation needed|date=December 2011}} rod and olfactory channels suggest that differences in DAG inhibition are due to differences in the attached loop of the [[transmembrane]] segment.<ref name= "inhibition">{{cite journal | author = Crary J, Dean D, Nguitragool W,Kurshan P, Zimmerman A, | title = Mechanism of Inhibition of Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated  Ion Channels by Diacylglycerol| journal = J Gen Physiology | volume = 116 | No. = 6 | pages = 755–768 | year = 2000 | month = December |pmc=2231817}}</ref>

== Physiological significance ==
=== Photoreceptors ===
{{Main|Photoreceptor cell}}
In the absence of light, [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] binds to CNG channels in photoreceptors. This binding causes the channels to open, which allows [[sodium|sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>)]] and [[calcium|calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)]] ions to flow into the cell causing the outer segment of the photoreceptor to [[depolarization|depolarize]]. This depolarizing flow of ions is known as the [[dark current (biochemistry)|dark current]]. When the [[retina]] of the eye detects light, a reaction known as a phototransduction cascade occurs. It is a [[signal transduction]] pathway that leads to the activation of the enzyme [[phosphodiesterase]], which [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] cGMP into 5’-GMP, decreasing the concentration of cGMP. In the absence of cGMP, the CNG channels in the photoreceptors close preventing the flow of the aforementioned dark current. This in turn causes a [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] of the outer segment of the photoreceptor, preventing the propagation of an [[action potential]] and the release of [[glutamate]].<ref name="photoreceptors"/><ref name="photoreceptors2"/> Studies have shown that over activation of cGMP-dependent CNG channels in photoreceptors can lead to their degeneration. If the CNG channels on a photoreceptor are continuously activated, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ion flux into the outer segment of the photoreceptor will increase so that it depolarizes beyond the dark current. Through a positive feedback loop, this would then increase the current of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cell. High concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the photoreceptor cell would lead to its death programmed cell death or [[apoptosis]].<ref name="photoapop">{{cite journal |last1=Vallazza-Deschamps |first1=Géraldine |last2=Cia |first2=David |last3=Gong |first3=Jie |last4=Jellali |first4=Abdeljelil |last5=Forster |first5= Valérie |last6=Sahel |first6= Jose A |last7=Tessier |first7= Luc-Henri |last8= Picaud |first8 = Serge |title=Excessive activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels contributes to neuronal degeneration of photoreceptors |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=22 |pages=1013–1022 |year=2005 |pmid=16176343 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2005.04306.x |issue=5}}</ref>

====Retinitis pigmentosa====
{{Main|Retinitis pigmentosa}}
Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a [[Genetics|genetic]] disease in which patients suffer degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors. The loss starts in the patient's [[peripheral vision]] and progresses to the central [[visual field]], leaving the patient blind by middle age. 

About 1% of RP patients have mutations in [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] alpha-subunit. Eight mutations have been identified- four are [[nonsense mutations]], one is a [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion]] that includes most of the transcriptional unit. The other three are [[missense mutations]] and [[frameshift mutations]], which lead to a shortening of amino acid sequence in the C terminus. It is still not known why the absence of cGMP-gated cation channels causes photoreceptor degradation. Mutations causing RP have also been found in the [[rhodopsin]] gene and in the alpha- and beta-subunits of rod [[phosphodiesterase]], which encode rod [[phototransduction]] cascades. The mutation of these subunits indirectly impairs rod cGMP-gated channel function, which implies that there is a common mechanism of photoreceptor degradation.<ref name="disease">{{cite book |last= Ashcroft |first= Frances |title= Ion Channels and Disease |publisher= [[Academic Press]] |year= 1999 |isbn= 0-12-065310-9}}</ref>

=== Olfactory sensory neurons ===
Almost all responses to odorants in [[olfactory sensory neurons]] (OSNs) are facilitated by CNG channels. When an [[odorant]] binds to its specific receptor in the chemosenstive [[cilia]] membrane, it activates a [[G protein]], which causes a downstream reaction activating the enzyme [[adenylyl cyclase]] (AC). This enzyme is responsible for an increase in cAMP concentration within the OSN. cAMP binds to the CNG channels in the OSN membrane, opening them, and making the cell highly permeable to [[Calcium|Ca2+]]. Calcium ions flow into the cell causing a [[depolarization]]. As in all other cell types, CNG channels in OSNs also allow Na+ to flow into the cell. Additionally, the increased Ca2+ concentration inside the cell activates Ca2+-dependent [[Chloride|chloride (Cl-)]] channels, which causes intracellular Cl- ions to also flow out of the cell augmenting the depolarization event. This depolarization stimulates an [[action potential]] which ultimately signals the reception of the odorant. In addition to  cAMP gated ion channels, a small subset of OSNs also has cGMP-selective CNG channels.<ref name="photoreceptors"/>

=== Spermatozoa ===
{{Main|Spermatozoon}}
[[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] and [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] mediate several cellular responses such as [[acrosomal exocytosis]], or the fusion of the male [[sperm]] to the female [[Egg (biology)|egg]], and [[chemotaxis]]. In the [[sea urchin]] species, ''[[Strongylocentrotus purpuratus]]'', speract, a short [[peptide]], was studied. Speract activates a receptor-type [[Guanylate cyclase|guanylate cyclase (GC)]] and stimulates a rise in [[intracellular]] cGMP concentrations. Speract also increases the concentration of [[calcium]]. Although there has yet to be any establishment of a direct causal relationship, the previously mentioned observations suggest that cGMP activates calcium [[Electrical conductance|conductance]]. CNG channels are prime candidates for the calcium-entry pathway, due to their high calcium permeability. CNG channels have yet to be detected by homology screening. 
In [[mammals]], the [[Testicle|testicular]] CNG channel subunits that are expressed are A3, B1, and B3. [[Heterologous|Heterologous expression]] of the A3 subunit was [[cloned]] from [[testis]] and produced channels that were cGMP sensitive and selective. It is possible that these channels are involved in a cGMP-stimulated calcium flux into the [[sperm]]. However a more extensive characterization of the channel has not been accomplished due to the low success rate of detecting channel activity. Since A3 subunit [[knockout mice]] are [[fertility|fertile]], CNG channels could be involved in some form of motility control and even in chemotactic swimming behavior or in the acrosomal exocytosis. However, a receptor-type GC in mammalian sperm has yet to be identified. Mouse sperm express other channels such as [[CatSper1]]. Male sterility can be accomplished by disrupting the CatSper1 gene; additionally, the cAMP-induced calcium influx is abolished in [[mutant]] mice. Although [[CatSper]] need additional subunits to become functional, they are unrelated to CNG channels because CatSper lacks a cAMP/cGMP-binding site. It is possible that CNG and CatSper subunits assemble to form calcium-permeable and cyclic nucleotide-sensitive ion channels.<ref name="photoreceptors"/>

=== Kidney ===
cGMP-sensitive channels have been analyzed in the [[renal medulla]], specifically in [[collecting duct]] cells, which influence the body’s [[electrolyte]] and [[fluid balance]]. CNG channel activity is controlled by the interaction between [[cGMP-dependent protein kinase]] and G1 protein because of cGMP's involvement in [[phosphorylation]] mechanisms. In the cells from an inner medullary collecting duct, CNG channels exhibit cation selectivity unit conductance, calcium permeability, and [[pharmacology]] very similar to cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. A [[stimulant]], [[Atrial natriuretic peptide|atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)]] increases cGMP production in the kidneys, which increases function of the [[glomerulus]] by a combination of relaxing and contracting [[arterioles]].<ref name="kidney">{{cite journal |last1= Biel |first1= Martin |last2= Zong |first2= Xiangang |last3= Distler |first3= Madeleine |last4= Bosse |first4= Eva |last5= Klugbauer |first5= Norbert |last6= Murakami |first6= Manabu |last7= Flockerzi |first7= Veit |last8= Hofmann |first8= Franz |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=91 |pages=3505–3509 |year=1994 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.9.3505 |pmc=43608 |pmid=8170936}}</ref> Differences between retinal and renal cDNA have been implicated in the functional differences between CNG channels in these two tissues.<ref name="photoreceptors"/>

===Gonadotropin-releasing hormone===
There has been identification of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel subunits A2, A4, and B1 in a neuronal cell line that secretes [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone|gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GrH)]]. The three subunits make up the CNG channels on chemosensitive [[cilia]] of OSNs. In high extracellular calcium, the unit conductance of CNG channels in rods and OSNs are significantly smaller than those measured in the neuronal line. It seems doubtful that CNG channels would create large unit conductance.<ref name="photoreceptors"/>

===Plants===
Cyclic nucleotide-gated ions channels in plants are similar in [[amino acid sequence]] and structure to non-selective [[cation]] CNG channels in animals, as well as trans-membrane-domain [[Voltage-gated potassium channel|K<sup>+</sup>-selective shaker family channels]]. However, there are drastic differences that are seen exclusively in plant CNG channels. The amino acid sequence of the [[Ion channel pore|pore]] sequence in plant CNG channels lacks the selectivity filter found in animal CNG channels as well as lacks a [[glycine]]-[[tyrosine]]-[[glycine]]-[[aspartate]] (GYGD) motif in the K<sup>+</sup>-selectivity filter sequence. Other sequence differences are seen in plant CNG channels, particularly in the cyclic nucleotide [[binding domain]] (CNBD). In plants, the [[Calmodulin binding domain]] (CaMBD) is found to overlap [[alpha helix|α-helix]] C in the CNBD of CNG channels. In animals the CaMBDs are located far away from the CNBD.<ref name= "Plants">{{cite journal | author = Kaplan B, Sherman T, Fromm H | title = Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels in plants | journal = FEBS Lett. | volume = 581 | issue = 12 | pages = 2237–46 | year = 2007 | month = May | pmid = 17321525 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2007.02.017 | url = }}</ref>

CNG channels play a large role in plant [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] and response to [[pathogen]]s or external infectious agents. They have also been implicated in [[apoptosis]] in plants. Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels are also thought to be involved in [[pollen]] development in plants, however its exact role in this mechanism is still not known.<ref name="Plants"/> 

Unlike animal CNG channels, plant CNG channels have not been extensively analyzed biochemically with respect to their structure.<ref name="Plants"/>

== Current and future research ==
Researchers have answered many important questions regarding cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels functions in vision and [[olfaction]]. In other physiological areas, the role of CNG channels is less defined. With technological growth, there now exists more possibilities for understanding these mechanisms.<ref name="photoreceptors"/>

Because [[nitric oxide]] (NO) is involved in stimulating the synthesis of cGMP, further research is being conducted to understand the physiological interaction of NO with CNG channels, particularly in the covalent modification of CNG channels in OSNs.<ref name="photoreceptors"/>

Scientists are adding on to the mechanism involved in the interaction of binding sites and interfaces of subunits. This might be nonexistent in non-cooperative CNG channels. It is also possible that binding site and gate are attached to a single subunit. In order to develop these ideas, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) and rapid fixing techniques can show these mechanistic movements.<ref name="cooperative"/>

A 2007 study suggests that because of the various and complex regulatory properties in addition to the large number of CNG channels in plants, a multidisciplinary study to research plant CNG channels should be conducted.<ref name="Plants"/> Another study in March 2011 recognizes recent reverse genetics data that has been helpful in further understanding CNG channels in plants, and also suggests that additional research be conducted to identify the upstream and downstream factors in CNGC-mediated signal transduction in plants.<ref name="photores">{{cite journal |last1=Moeder |first1=Wolfgang |last2=Urquhart |first2=William |last3=Ung |first3=Huoi |last4=Yoshioka |first4=Keiko |title=The Role of Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Ion Channels in Plant Immunity |journal=Molecular Plant | volume = 4 | No. = 3 | pages = 442–452 | year = 2011 | pmid= 21459831 | doi=10.1093/mp/ssr018 | issue=3}}</ref>

Scientist are speculating whether DAG directly binds with CNG channel during inhibition. It is possible that DAG may insert itself into the transmembrane domains in the channel. It is also possible that  DAG inserts itself into the interface between the channel and bilayer. The molecular mechanism of DAG inhibition is still not fully understood.<ref name="inhibition"/>
