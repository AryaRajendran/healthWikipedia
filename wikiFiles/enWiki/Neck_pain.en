'''Neck pain''' (or '''cervicalgia''') is a common problem, with two-thirds of the population having neck [[pain]] at some point in their lives.<ref name="pmid17347239">{{cite journal |author=Binder AI |title=Cervical spondylosis and neck pain |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue=7592 |pages=527–31 |year=2007 |pmid=17347239 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39127.608299.80 |pmc=1819511}}</ref>

Neck pain, although felt in the [[neck]], can be caused by numerous other spinal problems. Neck pain may arise due to muscular tightness in both the neck and upper back, or pinching of the nerves emanating from the [[cervical vertebrae]]. Joint disruption in the neck creates pain, as does joint disruption in the upper back.

The head is supported by the lower neck and upper back, and it is these areas that commonly cause neck pain. The top three joints in the neck allow for most movement of your neck and head. The lower joints in the neck and those of the upper back create a supportive structure for your head to sit on. If this support system is affected adversely, then the muscles in the area will tighten, leading to neck pain.

==Differential diagnosis==
Neck pain may come from any of the structures in the neck including: vascular, nerve, airway, digestive, and musculature / skeletal or be referred from other areas of the body.<ref>{{cite book |author=Amal Mattu; Deepi Goyal; Barrett, Jeffrey W.; Joshua Broder; DeAngelis, Michael; Peter Deblieux; Gus M. Garmel; Richard Harrigan; David Karras; Anita L'Italien; David Manthey |title=Emergency medicine: avoiding the pitfalls and improving the outcomes |publisher=Blackwell Pub./BMJ Books |location=Malden, Mass |year=2007 |pages=46 |isbn=1-4051-4166-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Major and severe causes of neck pain (roughly in order of severity) include: 

*[[Carotid artery dissection]]
*Referred pain from [[acute coronary syndrome]]
*[[Head and neck cancer]]
*Infections: [[retropharyngeal abscess]], [[epiglottitis]], etc.<ref>{{cite book |author=Amal Mattu; Deepi Goyal; Barrett, Jeffrey W.; Joshua Broder; DeAngelis, Michael; Peter Deblieux; Gus M. Garmel; Richard Harrigan; David Karras; Anita L'Italien; David Manthey |title=Emergency medicine: avoiding the pitfalls and improving the outcomes |publisher=Blackwell Pub./BMJ Books |location=Malden, Mass |year=2007 |pages=47 |isbn=1-4051-4166-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
*[[Spinal disc herniation]] – protruding or bulging discs, or if severe prolapse.
*[[Spondylosis]] - degenerative arthritis and osteophytes
*[[Spinal stenosis]] – a narrowing of the spinal canal

The more common and lesser neck pain causes include: 

*[[Stress (medicine)|Stress]] – physical and emotional stresses
*Prolonged [[Human position|postures]] – many people fall asleep on sofas and chairs and wake with sore necks
*Minor injuries and falls – car accidents, sporting events and day to day minor injuries
*[[Referred pain]] – mostly from upper back problems
*Over-use – muscular strain is one of the most common causes
*[[Whiplash (medicine)|Whiplash]]
*[[Herniated disc]]<ref>{{cite book |author=Dr. Kevin Yip |title=A Guide to Common Orthopaedic Problems |publisher=Singapore Sports and Orthopaedic Clinic |location=Singapore, Mass |year=2009 |pages=180 |isbn=1-4051-4166-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
*[[Pinched nerve]]

Although the causes are numerous, most are easily rectified by either professional help or using [[self help]] advice and techniques.

More causes include poor sleeping posture, torticollis, head injury, rheumatoid arthritis,
[[Carotidynia]], congenital cervical rib, mononucleosis, rubella, certain cancers, ankylosing spondylitis,
cervical spine fracture, esophageal trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, lymphadenitis, thyroid trauma, and tracheal trauma.

==Treatment==

Treatment of neck pain depends on the cause.  For the vast majority of people, neck pain can be treated conservatively.  Recommendations which may help alleviate symptoms include applying heat or cold.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Heat or Cold Packs for Neck and Back Strain: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Efficacy |first=Gregory |last=Garra |year=2010 |journal=Academic Emergency Medicine |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=484–9 |doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2010.00735.x |display-authors=2 |last2=Singer |first2=Adam J. |last3=Leno |first3=Richard |last4=Taira |first4=Breena R. |last5=Gupta |first5=Neeraj |last6=Mathaikutty |first6=Beena |last7=Thode |first7=Henry J. |pmid=20536800 }}</ref>  Other common treatments could include medication, body mechanics training, [[ergonomic]] reform, or physical therapy.

===Conservative treatment===
[[Exercise]] plus [[joint mobilization]] and/or [[joint manipulation]] ([[spinal adjustment]]) has been found to be beneficial in both acute and chronic mechanical neck disorders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=857 |title=BestBets: Manipulation and/or exercise for neck pain? |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Both cervical manipulation and cervical mobilisation produce similar immediate-, and short-term changes; no long-term data are available.<ref name=Cochrane05>{{cite journal |author=Gross AR |title=Manipulation or mobilisation for neck pain |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue= |pages=CD004249 |year=2010 |pmid=20091561 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004249.pub3 }}</ref> Thoracic manipulation may also improve pain and function.<ref name=Cochrane05/><ref name="Huisman">{{cite journal |author=Huisman PA, Speksnijder CM, de Wijer A |title=The effect of thoracic spine manipulation on pain and disability in patients with non-specific neck pain: a systematic review. |journal=Disabil Rehabil |volume= |issue= |pages= |year= |month= |pmid=23339721 |pmc= |doi=}}</ref> Low level laser therapy has been shown to reduce pain immediately after treatment in acute neck pain and up to 22 weeks

===Medication===

Analgesics such as acetaminophen or [[NSAIDs]] are recommended for pain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=spinaldi/6765&selectedTitle=2~143&source=search_result#28 |title=UpToDate Inc. |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>
[[Muscle relaxants]] are often prescribed and are effective.  However, one study showed that one muscle relaxant called [[cyclobenzaprine]] was not effective for treatment of acute cervical strain (as opposed to neck pain from other etiologies or chronic neck pain).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Khwaja SM, Minnerop M, Singer AJ |title=Comparison of ibuprofen, cyclobenzaprine or both in patients with acute cervical strain: a randomized controlled trial |journal=CJEM |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=39–44 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20078917 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Over the counter topical creams and patches may be effective for some patients.

===Surgery===
Surgery is usually not indicated for most mechanical causes of neck pain. If neck pain is the result of instability, cancer, or other disease process surgery may be necessary. Surgery is usually not indicated for "pinched nerves" or herniated discs unless there is spinal cord compression or pain and disability have been protracted for many months and refractory to conservative treatment such as [[physical therapy]].

==Epidemiology==

Neck pain affects about 330&nbsp;million people globally as of 2010 (4.9% of the population).<ref name=LancetEpi2012/> It is more common in women (5.7%) than men (3.9%).<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
About one-half of episodes resolve within one year.<ref name="pmid17347239"/> About 10% of cases become chronic.<ref name="pmid17347239"/>
