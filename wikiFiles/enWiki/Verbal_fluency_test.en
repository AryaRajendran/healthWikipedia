'''Verbal fluency tests''' are a kind of [[psychological testing|psychological test]] in which participants have to say as many words as possible from a category in a given time (usually 60 seconds). This category can be [[semantics|semantic]], such as animals or fruits, or [[phonemics|phonemic]], such as words that begin with letter ''p''.<ref name="isbn0-19-509031-4">{{cite book

The semantic fluency test is sometimes described as the category fluency test or simply as 'freelisting'. The COWAT (Controlled oral word association test) is the most employed phonetic variant.<ref name="pmid11686651">{{cite journal

* There is an [[hyperbolic]] decline in the rate of production of new items over the duration of the task.
* More typical category examplars are produced with higher frequency (i.e. by more subjects), and earlier in lists, than less typical ones.
* Items are produced in bursts of semantically-related words in the case of the semantic version and phonetic in the case of phonetic version.

==Neural correlates==
Regarding the [[brain]] areas used in this task, neuropsychological investigations implicate both [[frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] lobe areas, the contribution of the former being more important in the phonemic variant and of the latter in the semantic variant.<ref name="pmid17064451">{{cite journal

==Exploration of semantic memory==
[[Image:Animal addtree age7 nocat.png|thumb|190px|right|Cluster analysis of animal semantic fluency data from British schoolchildren.<ref name="Crowe2003"/>]]
[[Priming (psychology)|Priming]] studies indicate that when a word or concept is activated in memory, and then spoken, it will activate other words or concepts which are associatively related or semantically similar to it. This evidence suggests that the order in which words are produced in the fluency task will provide an indirect measure of [[semantic similarity|semantic distance]] between the items generated. Data from this semantic version of the task have therefore been the subject of many studies aimed at uncovering the structure of [[semantic memory]], determining how this structure changes during normal [[Child development|development]], or becomes disorganized through neurological disease or [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].

These studies generally make use of multiple fluency lists in order to make estimates of the semantic distance between pairs of concepts.<ref name="Prescott2006">{{cite journal

Such studies have generally found that semantic memory, at least as reflected by this test, has a [[Schema (psychology)|schematic]], or script-based, organization.<ref name="Lucariello1992">{{cite journal

For instance, the figure on the right shows a hierarchical clustering analysis of animal semantic fluency data from 55 British schoolchildren aged 7–8.<ref name="Crowe2003"/> The analysis reveals that children have schematic organization for this category according to which animals are grouped by where they are most commonly seen (on the farm, at home, in the ocean, at the zoo). Children, adults, and even zoology PhD candidates, all show this same tendency to cluster animals according to the environmental context in which they are observed.<ref name="Storm1980">{{cite journal
