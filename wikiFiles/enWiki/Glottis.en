The '''glottis''' is defined as the combination of the  [[vocal folds]] (vocal cords) and the space in between the folds (the [[rima glottidis]]).<ref>{{eMedicineDictionary|Glottis}}</ref>

==Function==
As the vocal folds vibrate, the resulting vibration produces a "buzzing" quality to the speech, called '''[[Voice (phonetics)|voice]]''' or '''voicing''' or '''pronunciation'''.

Sound production involving only the glottis is called ''glottal''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} English has a [[Voiceless glottal fricative|voiceless glottal transition]] spelled "h". In many accents of English the [[glottal stop]] (made by pressing the folds together) is used as a variant [[allophone]] of the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}} (and in some dialects, occasionally of {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/p/}}); in some languages, this sound is a [[phoneme]] of its own.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Skilled players of the Australian [[didgeridoo]] restrict their glottal opening in order to produce the full range of timbres available on the instrument.<ref>See "Acoustics:  The vocal tract and the sound of a didgeridoo", by Tarnopolsky et al. in Nature 436, 39 (7 July 2005))</ref>

The vibration produced is an essential component of ''voiced'' [[consonant]]s as well as [[vowel]]s. If the vocal folds are drawn apart, air flows between them causing no vibration, as in the production of voiceless consonants.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The glottis is also important in the [[valsalva maneuver]].

* Voiced consonants include {{IPA|/v/, /z/, /ʒ/, /d͡ʒ/, /ð/, /b/, /d/, /ɡ/, /w/.}}
* Voiceless consonants include {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /ʃ/, /t͡ʃ/, /θ/, /p/, /t/, /k/, /ʍ/, and /h/.}}
