The '''linea aspera''' ('''L.''' rough line) is a ridge of roughened surface on the posterior aspect of the [[femur]], to which are attached [[muscle]]s and intermuscular [[septum]]. 

Its margins diverge above and below.

The linea aspera is a prominent longitudinal ridge or crest, on the middle third of the bone, presenting a medial and a lateral lip, and a narrow rough, intermediate line. It is an important insertion point for the adductors and the intermuscular septa that divides the thigh into three compartments. The tension generated by muscle attached to the bones is responsible for the formation of the ridges.

==Ridges==
===Above===
Above, the linea aspera is prolonged by three ridges. 

* The '''lateral ridge''' is very rough, and runs almost vertically upward to the base of the greater trochanter. It is termed the gluteal tuberosity, and gives attachment to part of the [[Glut√¶us maximus]]: its upper part is often elongated into a roughened crest, on which a more or less well-marked, rounded tubercle, the [[third trochanter]], is occasionally developed. 
* The '''intermediate ridge''' or [[Pectineal line (femur)|pectineal line]] is continued to the base of the [[lesser trochanter]] and gives attachment to the [[Pectineus]]; 
* the '''medial ridge''' is lost in the [[intertrochanteric crest]]; between the intermediate and medial ridges a portion of the [[Iliacus]] is inserted.

===Below===
Below, the linea aspera is prolonged into two ridges, enclosing between them a triangular area, the ''popliteal surface'', upon which the [[popliteal artery]] rests. 

* Of these two ridges, the '''lateral''' is the more prominent, and descends to the summit of the [[Lateral condyle of femur|lateral condyle]]. 
* The '''medial''' is less marked, especially at its upper part, where it is crossed by the [[femoral artery]]. It ends below at the summit of the [[medial condyle of femur|medial condyle]], in a small tubercle, the [[adductor tubercle]], which affords insertion to the tendon of the [[Adductor magnus]].

==Muscles==
* From the ''medial lip'' of the linea aspera and its prolongations above and below, the [[Vastus medialis]] originates.
* From the ''lateral lip'' and its upward prolongation, the [[Vastus lateralis]] takes origin. 
* The [[Adductor magnus]] is inserted ''into the linea aspera'', and to its lateral prolongation above, and its medial prolongation below. 
* ''Between the Vastus lateralis and the Adductor magnus'' two muscles are ''attached'': 
**  the [[Gluteus maximus muscle|Gluteus maximus]] inserted above, 
**  and the short head of the [[Biceps femoris]] originating below. 
* ''Between the Adductor magnus and the Vastus medialis'' four muscles are ''inserted'': 
**  the [[Iliacus]] and [[Pectineus]] above; 
**  the [[Adductor brevis]] and [[Adductor longus]] below. 

The linea aspera is perforated a little below its center by the ''nutrient canal'', which is directed obliquely upward.
