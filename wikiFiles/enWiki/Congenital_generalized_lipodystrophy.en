==Presentation==
Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare [[autosomal recessive]] disorder which manifests with [[insulin resistance]], absence of [[subcutaneous fat]] and [[muscle|muscular]] [[hypertrophy]].<ref name="pmid19041432">{{cite journal |author=Friguls B, Coroleu W, del Alcazar R, Hilbert P, Van Maldergem L, Pintos-Morell G |title=Severe cardiac phenotype of Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy in an infant with homozygous E189X BSCL2 mutation |journal=[[Eur J Med Genet]] |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=14–6 |year=2009 |pmid=19041432 |doi=10.1016/j.ejmg.2008.10.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1769-7212(08)00140-7 |issn= |accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref>  The condition appears in early childhood with accelerated linear [[Human development (biology)|growth]], quick aging of bones, and a large appetite. As the child grows up, [[acanthosis nigricans]] ([[hyperpigmentation]] and thickening of skin) will begin to present itself throughout the body - mainly in the neck, trunk, and groin. <ref name="NEJM"></ref> The disorder also has characteristic features like [[hepatomegaly]] or an enlarged liver which arises from [[fatty liver]] and may lead to [[cirrhosis]], [[muscle]] [[hypertrophy]], lack of [[adipose tissue]], [[splenomegaly]], [[hirsutism]] (excessive hairiness) and [[hypertriglyceridemia]].<ref name="pmid7502362">{{cite journal |author=Gürakan F, Koçak N, Yüce A |title=Congenital generalized lipodystrophy: Berardinelli syndrome.

This impairs fertility for the women, and only a few documented cases of successful pregnancies in women with CGL exist. However, the fertility of men with the disorder is unaffected. <ref name="NEJM"> </ref>

===Type 1 vs Type 2 Differences===
There are differences in how Type 1 vs Type 2 patients are affected by the disease. In type 1 patients, they still have mechanical adipose tissue, but type 2 patients do not have any adipose tissue, including mechanical.<ref name="Ind">{{cite web | url=http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2011;volume=77;issue=3;spage=402;epage=402;aulast=Khandpur | title=Congenital generalized lipodystrophy of Berardinelli-Seip type: A rare case | publisher=Indian Journal Of Dermatology, Venereology And Leprology | accessdate=October 16, 2012 | author=Khandpur, Sujay | pages=402}}</ref> In type 2 patients, there is a greater likelihood of [[psychomotor retardation]] and [[intellectual impairment]]. <ref name="GeneReviews">{{cite web | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1212/ | title=Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy | publisher=University of Washington, Seattle | year=1993 | accessdate=September 5, 2012 | author=Van Maldergem, Lionel}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Medical diagnosis of CGL can be made after observing the physical symptoms of the disease: [[lipoatrophy]] (loss of fat tissues) affecting the trunk, limbs, and face; [[hepatomegaly]]; [[acromegaly]]; [[insulin resistance]]; and high serum levels of [[triglycerides]]. Genetic testing can also confirm the disease, as mutations in the [[AGPAT2]] gene is indicative of CGL1, a mutation in the [[BSCL2]] gene is indicative of CGL2, and mutations in the [[Caveolin_1|CAV1]] and [[PTRF]] genes are indicative of CGL3 and CGL4 respectively.<ref name="GeneReviews"></ref> Physical diagnosis of CGL is easier, as CGL patients are recognizable from birth, due to their extreme muscular appearance, which is caused by the absence of [[subcutaneous fat]]. <ref name="Ind"></ref>

CGL3 patients have [[serum (blood)|serum]] [[creatine kinase]] concentrations much higher than normal (2.5 to 10 times the normal limit). This can be used to diagnose type 3 patients and differentiate them from CGL 1 and 2 without mapping their genes. Additionally, CGL3 patients have low [[muscle tone]] when compared with other CGL patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=C. A. Kim, Marc Delépine ,Emilie Boutet ,Haquima El Mourabit, et. al. |title=Association of a Homozygous Nonsense Caveolin-1 Mutation with Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=1129 |year=2008 |month=April |doi=10.1210/jc.2007-1328 |url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/93/4/1129.long}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
===Type 1===
In individuals with Type 1 CGL, the disorder is caused by a mutation at the [[AGPAT2]] gene encoding [[1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase|1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2]] and located at 9q34.3. This enzyme catalyzes the [[acylation]] of [[lysophosphatidic acid]] to form [[phosphatidic acid]], which is important in the [[biosynthesis]] of [[fat]]s. This enzyme is highly expressed in [[adipose tissue]], so it can be concluded that when the enzyme is defective in CGL, lipids cannot be stored in the adipose tissue. <ref name=" AGPAT2">{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v31/n1/pdf/ng880.pdf | title=AGPAT2 is mutated in congenital generalized lipodystrophy linked to chromosome 9q34 | author=Agarwal AK, Arioglu E, de Almeida S, Akkoc N, Taylor SI, Bowcock AM, Barnes RI, Garg  A | journal=Nature | year=2002 | month=May | volume=31 | pages=21–23 | doi=10.1038/ng880 | pmid=11967537 | issue=1}}</ref>
===Type 2===
In those who have Type 2 CGL, a mutation in the [[BSCL2]] gene encoding the Seipin protein and located at  11q13. This gene encodes a protein, Seipin, whose function is unknown. <!-- If possible research to see if function has been discovered. --> Expression of mRNA for the seipin protein is high in the brain, yet low in [[adipose tissue|adipose tissues]]. Additionally, patients which have mutations in this protein have a higher incidence of [[mental retardation]] and lack mechanically active adipose tissue, which is present in those with [[AGPAT2]] mutations.<ref name="NEJM"></ref>
===Type 3===
Type 3 CGL involves a mutation is caused by a mutation in the [[Caveolin 1|CAV1]] gene. This gene codes for the [[Caveolin]] protein, which is a scaffolding membrane protein. This protein plays a role in lipid regulation. High levels of Cav1 are normally expressed in [[adipocytes]]. Thus, when the CAV1 gene mutates the adipocytes do not have Cav1 and are unable to properly regulate lipid levels. <ref name="seven">{{cite journal | author = Parton R.G., Simons K. | year = 2007 | title = The multiple faces of caveolae | url = | journal = Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 185–94 }}</ref>
===Type 4===
A mutation in the [[PTRF]] gene causes Type 4 CGL. This gene codes for a protein called polymerase I and transcript release factor. One of the roles the PTRF product has it to stabilize and aid in formation of [[caveolae]]. Thus, the mechanism is similar to Type 3, in that the caveolae are unable to properly form and carry out their role in lipid regulation in both. Types 3 and 4 are two different mutations but they share a common defective pathway.  <ref name="type4">{{cite web | url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PTRF  | title=PTRF | publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine | accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Metformin]] is the main drug used for treatment, as it is normally used for patients with [[hyperglycemia]]. <ref>{{cite journal | title=Metformin improves metabolic control in subjects with congenital generalized lipoatrophic diabetes | author=Victoria, I; Saad, M; Purisch, S; Pardini, V | journal=Diabetes | year=1997 | month=May | volume=46 | pages=618}}</ref> Metformin reduces appetite and improves symptoms of [[hepatic steatosis]] and [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]. <ref name="NEJM"> </ref> [[Leptin]] can also be used to reverse [[insulin resistance]] and [[hepatic steatosis]], to cause reduced food intake, and decrease [[blood glucose]] levels. <ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/15001 | title=Leptin reverses insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in patients with severe lipodystrophy | author=Petersen K.F., Oral E.A., Dufour S., et. al. | journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation | year=2002 | month=May | volume=109 | pages=1345–1350 | doi=10.1172/JCI15001 }}</ref>
===Diet===
CGL patients have to maintain a strict diet for life, as their excess appetite will cause them to overeat. Carbohydrate intake should be restricted in these patients. To avoid [[chylomicronemia]], CGL patients with [[hypertriglyceridemia]] need to have a diet very low in fat. CGL patients also need to avoid total [[proteins]], [[trans fats]], and eat high amounts of [[soluble fiber]] to avoid getting high levels of [[cholesterol]] in the blood.  <ref name="CCA">{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898109000096 | title=Clinical and molecular aspects of Berardinelli–Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy (BSCL) | author=Gomes K, Pardini VC, Fernandes AP | journal=Clinica Chimica Acta | year=2009 | month=April | volume=402 | pages=1–6 | doi=10.1016/j.cca.2008.12.032}}</ref>
