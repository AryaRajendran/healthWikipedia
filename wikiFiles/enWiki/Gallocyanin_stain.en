The '''gallocyanin stain''', also known as the '''gallocyanin-chromalum stain''', is a stain of the [[oxazine]] group for total [[nucleic acid]]s. It is an ideal method for numerous slides that need to be stained serially, equivalently, and reproducible.<ref name="Shah1991">{{cite book|author=C.K.

Structures containing [[basophilic compound]]s take on a bluish color.<ref name="Shah1991" />

==History==
It has been known since the early work of Einarson (1932) that the gallocyanin dye worked well for [[nucleotide]] constituents.<ref name="International review of cytology. 44.1976">{{cite book|title=International review of cytology. 44.1976|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7KAql81UfAkC&pg=PA150|accessdate=1 January 2013|year=1976|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-364344-5|pages=150–}}</ref> Gersch and colleagues at Chicago are often credited with the earliest efforts of using gallocyanin for staining.

Sandritter demonstrated that a [[stoichiometric]] relationship occurs between intensity of staining and quantity of nucleic acid present.<ref name="Morel1995">{{cite book|author=Gérard Morel|title=Visualization of Nucleic Acids|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AsqPg940ImIC&pg=PA9|accessdate=1 January 2013|year=1995|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-4781-8|pages=9–}}</ref> 

==Function==
Its method of binding and specificity are still not completely known. However, it is thought that gallocyanin-Cr(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub> selectively binds to nucleic acid [[phosphate]] groups, particularly within a [[pH|pH range]] of 1.5-1.75.<ref name="International review of cytology. 44.1976" />
