[[Image:Illu thoracic cage.jpg|thumb|right|The sternum, shown in blue-green]]
A '''sternal fracture''' is a [[bone fracture|fracture]] of the [[Human sternum|sternum]] (the breastbone), located in the center of the [[chest]].  The injury, which occurs in 5–8% of people who experience significant blunt [[chest trauma]], may occur in vehicle accidents, when the still-moving chest strikes a steering wheel or dashboard<ref name="Beck05"/> or is injured by a seatbelt. Sternal fractures may also occur as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture|pathological fracture], in people who have weakened bone in their sternum, due to another disease process.<ref name="Smith98">

The injury can also occur when the chest suddenly flexes, in the absence of an impact.<ref name="Smith98"/> Additionally, injury to the sternum may be made more likely if there are other disease processes in place that have weakened the bone - in this case, the fracture that occurs is termed a [[pathologic fracture]].

==Associated injuries==

Because of the high frequency of associated injuries, clinicians are taught to suspect that a patient has multiple severe injuries if a sternal fracture is present.<ref name="Moore04">

There is controversy over the question of whether the presence of sternal fracture is an indication of cardiac injuries.<ref name="Owens05"/>  Though over half of people with sternal fractures have been found to have [[electrocardiogram]] and [[Radionuclide cisternogram|radionucleotide]] abnormalities (abnormal test results indicating cardiac dysfunction), blunt injury to the heart may not occur at a higher rate with sternal fractures than they do in other patients with [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multisystem trauma]].<ref name="Owens05"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms include [[crepitus]] (a crunching sound made when broken bone ends rub together),<ref name="Beck05"/> pain, [[tenderness (medicine)|tenderness]], [[bruise|bruising]], and swelling over the fracture site.<ref name="Moore04"/>  The fracture may visibly move when the person breathes, and it may be bent or deformed,<ref name="Moore04"/> potentially forming a "step" at the junction of the broken bone ends that is detectable by [[palpation]].<ref name="Marini06"/> Associated injuries such as those to the heart may cause symptoms such as abnormalities seen on electrocardiograms.<ref name="Beck05"/>

The upper and middle parts of the sternum are those most likely to fracture,<ref name="Owens05"/> but most sternal fractures occur below the [[sternal angle]].<ref name="Beck05"/>

==Assessment and treatment==
[[Chest X-ray|X-rays of the chest]] are taken in people with chest trauma and symptoms of sternal fractures, and these may be followed by [[CT scan]]ning.<ref name="Jenkins"/>  Since X-rays taken from the front may miss the injury, they are taken from the side as well.<ref name="Stead00">

Management involves treating associated injuries; people with sternal fractures but no other injuries do not need to be hospitalized.<ref name="Moore04"/> However, because it is common for cardiac injuries to accompany sternal fracture, heart function is monitored with electrocardiogram.<ref name="Buckman87">

Patients who have experienced a [[pathologic fracture]] will be investigated for the cause of the underlying disease, if it is unknown. Treatment of any underlying disease, such as chemotherapy if indicated for bone cancer, may help to improve the pain of a sternal fracture.
