'''Emtricitabine/tenofovir/efavirenz''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INNs]], trade names '''Atripla''', '''Viraday''') is a [[fixed-dose combination (antiretroviral)|fixed-dose combination]] drug for the treatment of [[HIV]] infection. It combines [[Gilead Sciences]]'s [[tenofovir]] and [[emtricitabine]] (already available in the anti-HIV combination [[Truvada]]) with [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]'s [[efavirenz]] into a fixed-dose pill. Combining the three drugs into a single, once-daily pill reduces [[pill burden]] and simplifies dosing schedules, and therefore has the potential to increase adherence to [[antiretroviral]] therapy.

Atripla is the first multi-class antiretroviral drug available in the United States and represents the first collaboration between two U.S. pharmaceutical companies to combine their patented anti-HIV drugs into one product.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Search for Tradename: Atripla | url=http://drugpatentwatch.com/ultimate/preview/tradename/index.php?query=Atripla | work=Drug Patent Watch | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref> The drug retails in the United States for {{US$|1,850}} for a one-month supply. As of 2007, annual cost in India is US$1,344, and US$528 in Africa. It was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] on July 12, 2006. In the UK, the drug cost to the NHS is {{GB£}}626.90 per month<ref name="BNF Atripla">{{cite web|title=BNF Atripla|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/200890.htm}}</ref>  as of March 2012.

Atripla is a fixed dose combination of 600&nbsp;mg [[efavirenz]], 300&nbsp;mg [[tenofovir]], and 200&nbsp;mg [[emtricitabine]].  In adults, it is taken once daily on an empty stomach.  Dosing at bedtime is recommended to improve tolerability of nervous system symptoms.  Atripla is not recommended for patients under 18 years of age.

Atripla is a pink, film-coated tablet with "123" impressed on one side.

In North America and Europe, Atripla is marketed jointly by [[Gilead Sciences]] and [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], but in much of the developing world, marketing and distribution is handled by [[Merck & Co.]]<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Merck To Register, Lower Cost Of Antiretroviral Atripla In Developing Countries | url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/63612.php | work=Medical News Today | date=23 February 2007  | accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref> [[Cipla]] released its own version of Atripla in India, called '''Viraday'''. In [[Argentina]], Atripla is marketed by Laboratorios Gador.

In [[South Africa]], the National [[Health minister|Minister of Health]], Doctor [[Aaron Motsoaledi]], administered to the first state patient a fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir/Efavirenz on 9 April 2013 in GaRankuwa.

== Background ==
Atripla was approved as a once daily tablet to treat HIV in 2006. The main advantage of the new drug Atripla was that could be taken once daily and reduces the overall stress in an antiretroviral regimen.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=HIV Medication List - AIDS Drugs: | url=http://www.aidsdrugsonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=27 | work=AIDS Drugs HIV Reference | publisher=aidsdrugsonline | year=2009 | accessdate=2010-01-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> There is currently no generic version of Atripla available in the United States, but countries like Brazil and India are involved with compulsory licensing. The main advantage for these countries in producing a generic Atripla (Viraday) is they can sell it domestically at a radically lower cost than the price of the United States version. India is currently a signatory to [[TRIPS]] and consequently there will be a drop in the amount of generic HIV medicines available.

== Dosage ==

Recommended dosage for Atripla is 1 tablet at or before bedtime. Side effects can be reduced if Atripla is taken on an empty stomach. For patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency, patient can take 1 tablet by mouth once a day. However, patients whose CrCl levels are less than 50ml/min should not follow this dosage. Instead, patients should be prescribed drug components of the fixed-dose combinations while adjusting TDF and TFC doses according to the patient’s CrCl levels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents.

==Mechanism of action==
Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRT) of HIV-1. Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) of HIV-1.Tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1, but it can be classified as a NRTI. These three drugs work in combination to target HIV at different point in its life cycle and it reduces the virus’s capacity to mutate.<ref name="Atripla Prescribing Information">[http://www.atripla.com/pdfs/pi.pdf Atripla &#91;package insert&#93;. Wallingford Center, CT: Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gilead Sciences, LLC; 2011 Sep.], .</ref>

'''Antiviral activity'''
In combination studies there were synergistic antiviral effects observed between emtricitabine and efavirenz, efavirenz  and tenofovir, and emtricitabine and tenofovir.<ref name="Atripla Prescribing Information"/>

== Side effects ==
Common side effects of Atripla are tiredness, dizziness, gastrointestinal distress, and skin discoloration. More severe side effects are hallucinations, sleeplessness and depression.<ref name=side-effects>{{cite web | author= | title=Possible Side Effects of ATRIPLA | url=http://www.atripla.com/Content.aspx?bmscontentpg=atripla-side-effects | publisher=Bristol-Myers Squibb & Gilead Sciences, LLC | year=2008 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref>

== Interactions ==
Medications that should not be taken with Atripla are "Hismanal (astemizole), Vascor (bepridil), Propulsid (cisapride), Versed (midazolam), Orap (pimozide), Halcion (triazolam), or ergot derivatives (for example, Wigraine and Cafergot)." Discuss any other HIV or hepatitis medications you are taking with your doctor to avoid complications. Additionally, St. John's wort is known to reduce the effectiveness of Atripla, resulting in increased viral load and possible resistance to Atripla.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Medicines You Should Not Take with ATRIPLA | url=http://www.atripla.com/Content.aspx?bmscontentpg=hiv-medications | publisher=Bristol-Myers Squibb & Gilead Sciences, LLC | year=2008 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref>

Drugs that are contraindicated in the intake of Atripla are: voriconazole, ergot derivative drugs, benzodiazepines midazolam and triazolam, calcium channel blocker bepridil, cisapride, pimozide and St. John’s wort (''Hypericum perforatum'') Breastfeeding is also contraindicated.<SUP>[6]</SUP>
