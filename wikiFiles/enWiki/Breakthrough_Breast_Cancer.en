'''Breakthrough Breast Cancer''' is a [[United Kingdom]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] dedicated to saving lives by finding the causes of breast cancer, improving detection, diagnosis, treatment and services.

==History==

The Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, at the [[Institute of Cancer Research]], is the result of more than ten years' work by Breakthrough Breast Cancer and its supporters. Breakthrough was the vision of Bill Freedman and his children. Freedman's wife, actress [[Toby Robins]] (1931–1986), died from breast cancer in 1986. With Professor [[Barry Gusterson]] of the Institute of Cancer Research, Freedman realized that a new approach was needed to tackle this disease. Their vision was of a centre of excellence for breast cancer research, with experts working under one roof on a coordinated programme of research. Breakthrough Breast Cancer was founded to make this a reality.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/me-and-my-breasts-1278660.html | title=The Independent | accessdate=1997-02-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://rdfunding.org.uk/Queries/ListCharityDetails.asp?CharityID=2025 | title=RDFunding | accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref>

In addition to the Breakthrough Research Centre, Breakthrough has campaigned for better breast cancer services. In November 2003, Breakthrough's Campaigns & Advocacy Network [http://www.breakthrough.org.uk/can] was formed when the UK Breast Cancer Coalition (UKBCC) merged with Breakthrough Breast Cancer. Breakthrough works in partnership with other cancer research organisations and is a member of the [[National Cancer Research Institute]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://someonedies.com/index.php/featured/breakthrough-breast-cancer/ | title=What to do when somebody dies | accessdate=2009-02-11}}</ref>

==Breakthrough Generations Survey==
The Breakthrough Generations Survey aims to survey 100,000 women and "plans to be the largest, most comprehensive scientific study into the causes of breast cancer" <ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.breakthroughgenerations.org.uk/index.html | title=Breakthrough generations| accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.library.nhs.uk/genepool/ViewResource.aspx?resID=60108 | title=Breakthrough Generations Study | author = NHS National Library for Health, Clinical Genetics Specialist Library | accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref> It is being carried out in association with the [[Institute of Cancer Research]]. Women taking part are asked to complete a comprehensive questionnaire about a wide range of health and lifestyle topics, and to have a blood sample taken, and will be followed up by investigators over the next 50 years.

==Fundraising campaigns==
Breakthrough Breast Cancer offers many fundraising campaigns throughout the year, including [[Fashion Targets Breast Cancer]], £1,000 Challenge, Go Pink, running events, treks and more.
