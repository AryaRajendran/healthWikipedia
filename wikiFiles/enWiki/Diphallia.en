'''Diphallia''', '''penile duplication''' ('''PD'''), '''diphallic terata''', or '''diphallasparatus''', is a rare [[medical]] condition in which a male infant is born with two [[penis]]es. The first reported case was by [[Johannes Jacob Wecker]] in 1609.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jiaps.com/article.asp?issn=0971-9261;year=2000;volume=5;issue=1;spage=18;epage=21;aulast=Sharma;type=0|title=Concealed diphallus :a Case report and review of the literature.|publisher=Journal of Indian Association of Pediatric Surgeons|accessdate=2010-03-07|archiveurl=http://www.jiaps.com/article.asp?issn=0971-9261;year=2000;volume=5;issue=1;spage=18;epage=21;aulast=Sharma;type=0|archivedate=2000}}</ref> Its occurrence is 1 in 5,500,000 men in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=DEL270522|title=Indian man wants op to remove extra organ|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2006-08-18|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070122012925/http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=DEL270522|archivedate=22 January 2007}}</ref>

When diphallia is present, it is usually accompanied by other [[congenital]] anomalies such as [[kidney|renal]], [[vertebra]]l, [[hindgut]] or [[anorectal]] duplication. There is also a higher risk of [[spina bifida]]. Infants born with PD and its related conditions have a higher death rate from various infections associated with their more complex renal or colorectal systems.

It is thought diphallia occurs in the [[fetus]] between the 23rd and 25th days of [[gestation]] when an injury, chemical stress, or malfunctioning [[homeobox]] genes hamper proper function of the [[caudal cell mass]] of the fetal [[germ layer#Mesoderm|mesoderm]] as the [[urogenital sinus]] separates from the [[genital tubercle]] and [[rectum]] to form the penis.
