'''Whole bowel irrigation''' ('''WBI''') is a medical process involving the rapid administration of large volumes of an [[Osmoregulation|osmotically]] balanced [[polyethylene glycol]] solution ('''GoLYTELY''', '''CoLyte'''), either orally or via a [[nasogastric tube]], to flush out the entire [[gastrointestinal tract]].

==History==
Whole bowel irrigation was originally developed to cleanse the large bowel before [[surgery]] or [[colonoscopy]].<ref name="lancet1973-hewitt">{{cite journal | author = Hewitt J, Reeve J, Rigby J, Cox A | title = Whole-gut irrigation in preparation for large-bowel surgery | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 7825 | pages = 337–40 | year = 1973 | pmid = 4124525 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(73)93189-9}}</ref> Initially a solution of [[sodium chloride]], [[potassium chloride]], and [[sodium bicarbonate]] was used but this [[electrolyte]] solution was shown to be absorbed by the body, sometimes leading to complications. To solve this problem a specialized irrigation fluid was developed consisting mainly of an iso-osmolar solution of [[polyethylene glycol]].<ref name="Gastroenterology1980-davis">{{cite journal | author = Davis G, Santa Ana C, Morawski S, Fordtran J | title = Development of a lavage solution associated with minimal water and electrolyte absorption or secretion | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 78 | issue = 5 Pt 1 | pages = 991–5 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7380204}}</ref> With the polyethylene glycol solution there is negligible fluid or electrolyte absorption and several studies have shown the overall safety of the procedure. Whole bowel irrigation was also suggested as a possible treatment for toxic ingestions.<ref name="Gastroenterology1980-davis"/> WBI has the effect of mechanically flushing the ingested [[poison]] out of the gastrointestinal tract before it can be absorbed into the body. A study in 1987 provided evidence that whole bowel irrigation is an effective and safe gastrointestinal decontamination procedure for acute poisoning.<ref name="archinternmed1987-tenenbein">{{cite journal | author = Tenenbein M, Cohen S, Sitar D | title = Whole bowel irrigation as a decontamination procedure after acute drug overdose | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 147 | issue = 5 | pages = 905–7 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3579442 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.147.5.905}}</ref> Its common administration for toxic ingestions has been largely replaced with that of activated charcoal.

==Technique==
Whole bowel irrigation is undertaken either by having the patient drink the solution or a [[nasogastric tube]] is inserted and the solution is delivered down the tube into the [[stomach]]. The solution is administered at a rate of  500 mL/h in children 9 months to 6 years, 1000 mL/h in children 6 to 12 years, and 1500 to 2000 mL/h in adolescents and adults.<ref name="clintox2004-pospaper">{{cite journal | author = | title = Position paper: whole bowel irrigation | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 843–54 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15533024| doi = 10.1081/CLT-200035932}}</ref> The patient is usually seated on a toilet and the procedure continues until the [[rectal]] effluent is clear. The entire procedure usually takes 4 to 6 hours.<ref name="medtox1988-tenenbein">{{cite journal | author = Tenenbein M | title = Whole bowel irrigation as a gastrointestinal decontamination procedure after acute poisoning | journal = Med Toxicol Adverse Drug Exp | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 77–84 | year = 1988| pmid = 3287090}}</ref> Often patients [[vomiting|vomit]] (especially if [[Syrup of ipecac|ipecac]] was given prior to the procedure or following ingestion of a drug that produces vomiting such as [[aspirin]] or [[theophylline]]), indicating that the rate of infusion may need to be slowed or an [[antiemetic]] such as [[metoclopramide]] given.

==Indications==
Whole bowel irrigation is indicated prior to surgery, colonoscopy, or a [[barium enema]] to cleanse the [[bowel]]. Whole bowel irrigation is not used routinely in poisoning situations. It is usually reserved for patients who have ingested toxic doses of medications not absorbed by [[activated charcoal]] (such as [[iron]] and [[lithium]]), potentially toxic ingestions of sustained-release or enteric-coated drugs, or in the situation of packaged drug ingestion ([[Mule (smuggling)|body packing/stuffing]]).<ref name="clintox2004-pospaper"/>

==Contraindications==
Major gastrointestinal dysfunction precludes the use of whole bowel irrigation. WBI is specifically [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in the presence of [[ileus]], significant gastrointestinal [[hemorrhage]], hemodynamic instability, uncontrollable intractable vomiting, bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, and in patients with a decreased level of consciousness with a compromised unprotected airway.<ref name="clintox2004-pospaper"/>

==Complications==
Minor complications include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], abdominal cramps, and [[bloating]].<ref name="Gastroenterology1983-ernstoff">{{cite journal | author = Ernstoff J, Howard D, Marshall J, Jumshyd A, McCullough A | title = A randomized blinded clinical trial of a rapid colonic lavage solution (Golytely) compared with standard preparation for colonoscopy and barium enema | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 84 | issue = 6 | pages = 1512–16 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6341159}}</ref> Patients with altered mental status or a compromised and unprotected airway are at risk for [[pulmonary aspiration]].<ref name="clintox2004-pospaper"/>
