'''Cystectomy''' is a medical term for [[surgery|surgical]] removal of all or part of the [[urinary bladder]]. It may also be rarely used to refer to the removal of a [[cyst]], or the [[gallbladder]]. The most common condition warranting removal of the [[urinary bladder]] is [[bladder cancer]].<ref name="Clark">{{cite journal | last=Clark | first=PE | coauthors=Stein JP, Groshen SG et al. | title=Radical cystectomy in the elderly: comparison of clinical outcomes between younger and older patients | journal=Cancer | volume=104 | issue=1 | pages=36â€“43 | month=July | year=2005 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/110500895/HTMLSTART?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 | pmid=15912515 | doi=10.1002/cncr.21126  }}</ref> After the bladder has been removed, an [[Ileal conduit urinary diversion]] is necessary. An alternative to this method is to construct a pouch from a section of [[ileum]] or [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], which can act as a form of replacement bladder, storing urine until the patient desires to release it, which can be achieved by either abdominal straining or self [[catheter]]isation.
Future treatment for this condition may involve a full replacement with an [[artificial bladder]].

One of the follow-up solutions to a '''cystectomy''' is the creation of a neobladder (one form of which is named Studer's Ileal Neobladder or the Studer Pouch). A neobladder is a loop of [[intestine]] that is surgically fashioned into a pouch and placed in the location of the original bladder. It is then attached to the [[ureters]] and the [[urethra]], thus simulating the function of the original organ. The [[kidneys]] filter the [[urine]] into the neobladder which can often be emptied by muscle control. There are side effects of this complex surgery, including partial shut down of the digestive system (in response to removal of the piece of intestine), [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], and the loss of the nerves that signal a full bladder.
