A '''bee sting''' is strictly a [[stinger|sting]] from a [[bee]] ([[honey bee]], [[bumblebee]], [[sweat bee]], etc.). In the vernacular it can mean a sting of a [[bee]], [[wasp]], [[hornet]], or [[yellow jacket]]. Some people may even call the bite of a [[horse-fly]] a bee sting. The stings of most of these species can be quite painful, and are therefore keenly avoided by many people.

Bee stings differ from [[Insect bites and stings|insect bites]], and the [[venom]] or [[toxin]] of stinging [[insect]]s is quite different. Therefore, the body's reaction to a bee sting may differ significantly from one [[species]] to another.

The most aggressive stinging insects are [[Vespidae|vespid wasps]] (including [[bald-faced hornet]]s and other [[yellow jacket]]s) but not [[hornet]]s in general (e.g., the [[European hornet]] is less harmful). All of these insects aggressively defend their nests.

In people with [[insect sting allergy]], a bee sting may trigger a dangerous [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]] that is potentially deadly. Honey bee stings release [[pheromone]]s that prompt other nearby bees to attack.

==Honey bee stings==
A honey bee that is away from the hive foraging for [[nectar]] or [[pollen]] will rarely sting, except when stepped on or roughly handled. Honey bees will actively seek out and sting when they perceive the [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]] to be threatened, often being alerted to this by the release of attack [[pheromone]]s (below).

Although it is widely believed that a [[worker bee|worker]] [[honey bee]] can sting only once, this is a partial misconception: although the [[stinger]] is in fact barbed so that it lodges in the victim's [[skin]], tearing loose from the bee's [[abdomen]] and leading to its death in minutes, this only happens if the skin of the victim is sufficiently thick, such as a mammal's.<ref name="how bees work">[http://science.howstuffworks.com/zoology/insects-arachnids/bee2.htm  How Bees Work] – ''howstuffworks.com.'' Retrieved 22 January 2013.</ref> Honey bees are the only [[hymenoptera]] with a strongly barbed sting, though [[yellow jacket]]s and some other wasps have small barbs.

Bees with barbed stingers can often sting other insects without harming themselves. Queen honeybees and bees of many other species, including bumblebees and many solitary bees, have smooth stingers and can sting mammals repeatedly.<ref name="how bees work"/>

The sting's injection of [[apitoxin]] into the victim is accompanied by the release of alarm [[pheromone]]s, a process which is accelerated if the bee is fatally injured. Release of alarm pheromones near a hive or [[swarm]] may attract other bees to the location, where they will likewise exhibit defensive behaviors until there is no longer a threat, typically because the victim has either fled or been killed. (Note: A true swarm is not hostile; it has deserted its hive and has no comb or young to defend.) These pheromones do not dissipate or wash off quickly, and if their target enters water, bees will resume their attack as soon as it leaves the water.

The larger [[Drone (bee)|drone]] bees, the males, do not have stingers. The female [[worker bee]]s are the only ones that can sting, and their stinger is a modified [[ovipositor]]. The [[queen bee]] has a smooth stinger and can, if need be, sting skin-bearing creatures multiple times, but the queen does not leave the hive under normal conditions. Her sting is not for defense of the hive; she only uses it for dispatching rival queens, ideally before they can finish [[pupa]]ting. Queen breeders who handle multiple queens and have the queen odor on their hands are sometimes stung by a queen.

The main component of [[apitoxin|bee venom]] responsible for pain in [[vertebrate]]s is the toxin [[melittin]]; [[histamine]] and other biogenic amines may also contribute to pain and itching.<ref name="white">{{cite book|author=Meier J, White J.|title=Clinical toxicology of animal venoms and poisons|year=1995|publisher=CRC Press, Inc|isbn=0-8493-4489-1}}</ref> In one of the medical uses of [[honey bee]] products, [[apitherapy]], bee venom has been used to treat [[arthritis]] and other painful conditions.<ref>Phillip Terc.

The sting consists of three parts: a stylus and two barbed slides (or lancets), one on either side of the stylus. The bee does not push the sting in but it is drawn in by the barbed slides. The slides move alternately up and down the stylus so when the barb of one slide has caught and retracts, it pulls the stylus and the other barbed slide into the wound. When the other barb has caught, it also retracts up the stylus pulling the sting further in. This process is repeated until the sting is fully in and even continues after the sting and its mechanism is detached from the bee's abdomen.

When a honey bee stings a person, it cannot pull the barbed stinger back out. It leaves behind not only the stinger, but also part of its abdomen and digestive tract, plus muscles and nerves. This massive abdominal rupture is what kills the honey bee.  Honey bees are the only species of bees to die after stinging.<ref>[http://nature.berkeley.edu/urbanbeegardens/general_legends.html  Urban Bee Gardens] Urban Bee Legends – by Jaime Pawelek</ref>

==Treatment==
The first step in treatment following a bee sting is removal of the stinger itself. The stinger should be removed as quickly as possible without regard to method: studies have shown the amount of venom delivered does not differ whether the sting is pinched or scraped off and even a delay of a few seconds leads to more venom being injected.<ref name="lancet1996-Visscher">{{cite journal|author=Visscher P, Vetter R, Camazine S|title=Removing bee stings.|journal=Lancet|volume=348|issue=9023|pages=301–2|year=1996|pmid=8709689|doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)01367-0}}</ref> Once the stinger is removed, pain and swelling should be reduced with a cold compress.<ref name = "balit">{{cite journal|author=Balit C, Isbister G, Buckley N|title=Randomized controlled trial of topical aspirin in the treatment of bee and wasp stings|journal=J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol.|volume=41|issue=6|pages=801–8|year=2003|pmid=14677790|doi= 10.1081/CLT-120025345}}</ref>

Many traditional remedies have been suggested for bee stings including [[Tobacco products#Topical tobacco paste|damp pastes of tobacco]], [[salt]], [[baking soda]], [[papain]], [[toothpaste]], [[clay]], [[garlic]], [[urine]], [[onion]]s, [[aspirin]] or even application of [[copper]] coins.<ref name="glaser">{{cite web|last=Glaser|first=David|title=Are wasp and bee stings alkali or acid and does neutralising their [[pH]] them give sting relief?|work=|publisher=www.insectstings.co.uk|date=|url = http://www.insectstings.co.uk/sting-acid-or-alkali.shtml|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref><ref>[http://pubs.caes.uga.edu/caespubs/pubcd/c782-w.html Beverly Sparks, "Stinging and Biting Pests of People"] Extension Entomologist of the University of Georgia College of Agricultural & Environmental Sciences Cooperative Extension Service.</ref>

Bee venom is acidic as it contains the highly acidic peptide [[melittin]], and these interventions are often recommended to neutralize the venom; however, neutralizing a sting is unlikely to be effective as the venom is injected under the skin and deep into the tissues, where a topically applied alkali is unable to reach, so neutralization is unlikely to occur.<ref name="glaser">{{cite web|last=Glaser|first=David|title=Are wasp and bee stings alkali or acid and does neutralising their pH them give sting relief?|work=|publisher=www.insectstings.co.uk|date=|url = http://www.insectstings.co.uk/sting-acid-or-alkali.shtml|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> In any case, the amount of venom injected is typically very small (between 5 and 50 micrograms of fluid) and placing large amounts of alkali near the sting site is unlikely to produce a perfectly neutral pH to stop the pain.<ref name="glaser"/> Many people do claim benefit from these home remedies but it is doubtful they have any real physical effect on how much a sting hurts or continues hurting. The effect is probably related to [[pain#Gate control theory|rubbing the area]] or the [[Placebo|mind perceiving benefit]].<ref name="glaser"/> Furthermore, none of these interventions have been proven to be effective in scientific studies and a randomized trial of aspirin paste and topical ice packs showed that aspirin was not effective in reducing the duration of swelling or pain in bee and wasp stings, and significantly increased the duration of redness.<ref name="balit"/> The study concluded that ice alone is better treatment for bee and wasp stings than aspirin.<ref name="balit"/>

The sting may be painful for a few hours. Swelling and itching may persist for a week. The area should not be scratched as it will only increase the itching and swelling. If a reaction persists for over a week or covers an area greater than 7–10&nbsp;cm (3 or 4&nbsp;inches), medical attention should be sought. Doctors often recommend a [[tetanus]] [[immunization]]. For about 2 percent of people, a hypersensitivity can develop after being stung, creating a more severe reaction when stung again later. This sensitisation may happen after a single sting, or after a series of stings where they reacted normally. A highly allergic person may suffer [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]] from certain proteins in the venom, which can be life-threatening and requires emergency treatment.<ref>[http://www.beesource.com/resources/usda/hymenopterous-insect-stings/ Thor Lehnert, "Hymenopterous Insect Stings"] ''Beekeeping in the United States'' – USDA – Agricultural HandBook Number 335</ref> People known to be highly allergic may carry around [[epinephrine]] in the form of a self-injectable [[EpiPen]] for the treatment of an [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]].

For patients who experience severe or life threatening reactions to insect stings, researchers at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] have developed a series of allergy injections composed of increasing concentrations of naturally occurring venom which provide excellent and usually lifelong protections against future insect stings.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Resiman|first=R|title = Insect Stings|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=26|year=1994|month=August|pages=523–7|doi=10.1056/NEJM199408253310808| pmid = 8041420|issue=8}}</ref>
