'''Auditory processing disorder''' (APD), also known as '''central auditory processing disorder''' (CAPD) is an umbrella term for a variety of disorders that affect the way the brain processes [[Sound|auditory]] information.<ref name="AAA, 2010">{{cite web |url=http://www.audiology.org/resources/documentlibrary/Documents/CAPD%20Guidelines%208-2010.pdf |title=Clinical practice guidelines – diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing |format=pdf |work=American Academy of Audiology |accessdate=}}</ref> Individuals with APD usually have normal structure and function of the outer, middle and inner ear (peripheral hearing). However, they cannot process the information they hear in the same way as others do, which leads to difficulties in recognizing and interpreting sounds, especially the sounds composing speech. It is thought that these difficulties arise from dysfunction in the central nervous system (i.e., brain).  APD has been referred to as dyslexia for the ears.

APD does not feature in mainstream diagnostic classifications such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV). APD is not a coherent syndrome with clear diagnostic criteria.<ref name='Dawes & Bishop(2009)'>{{cite journal |author=Dawes P, Bishop D |title=Auditory processing disorder in relation to developmental disorders of language, communication and attention: a review and critique |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=440–65 |year=2009 |pmid=19925352 |doi=10.1080/13682820902929073 |url=}}</ref> Rather, it is a label applied when a person has difficulties in recognizing and interpreting sounds that are not due to peripheral hearing loss.

APD can affect both children and adults, although the actual prevalence is currently unknown. It has been suggested that males are twice as likely to be affected by the disorder as females,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/hcs/resources/capd/capd/index.html |title=(C)APD|author= La Trobe University |accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Musiek |first1=Frank |authorlink1= |last2=Gail |first2=Chermak |authorlink2= |title=Handbook of central auditory processing disorder |trans_title=auditory neuroscience and diagnosis |year= 2007|publisher= Plural Publishing|isbn= 1-59756-056-1|pages= 448}}</ref> but there are no good epidemiological studies.

Auditory processing disorder can be developmental or acquired. It may result from ear infections, head injuries or neurodevelopmental delays that affect processing of auditory information. This can include problems with: "...[[sound localization]] and lateralization (see also [[binaural fusion]]); auditory discrimination; auditory pattern recognition; temporal aspects of audition, including temporal integration, temporal discrimination (e.g., temporal gap detection), temporal ordering, and [[temporal masking]]; auditory performance in competing acoustic signals (including [[dichotic listening]]); and auditory performance with degraded acoustic signals."<ref name='ASHA 2005'>{{cite web

The Committee  of UK Medical Professionals Steering the UK Auditory Processing Disorder Research Program have developed the following working definition of Auditory Processing Disorder: "APD results from impaired neural function and is characterized by poor recognition, discrimination, separation, grouping, localization, or ordering of speech sounds. It does not solely result from a deficit in general attention, language or other cognitive processes."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebsa.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=21&Itemid=29 |title= The British Society of Audiology and the UK APD Steering Group}}</ref>

==History==
The first research into APD began in 1954 with Helmer Myklebust’s study, "Auditory Disorders in Children".<ref>Myklebust, H. (1954). Auditory disorders in children. New York: Grune & Stratton.</ref> Myklebust’s work suggested auditory processing disorder was separate from [[language]] learning difficulties. His work sparked interest in auditory deficits after acquired brain lesions affecting the temporal lobes<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bocca E, Calearo C, Cassinari V |title=A new method for testing hearing in temporal lobe tumours; preliminary report |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=219–21 |year=1954 |pmid=13197002 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bocca E, Calearo C, Cassinari V, Migliavacca F |title=Testing "cortical" hearing in temporal lobe tumours |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=289–304 |year=1955 |pmid=13275293 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  and led to additional work looking at the physiological basis of auditory processing,<ref name="Kimura1961">{{cite journal|last1=Kimura|first1=Doreen|title=Cerebral dominance and the perception of verbal stimuli.|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology/Revue canadienne de psychologie|

In 1977, a conference about APD started a new series of studies focussing on APD in children.<ref>Katz, J., & Illmer, R. (1972). Auditory perception in children with learning disabilities. In J.

These early researchers also invented many of the auditory training approaches, including interhemispheric transfer training and interaural intensity difference training.

Much of the work in the late nineties and 2000s has been looking to refining testing, developing more sophisticated treatment options, and looking for genetic risk factors for APD.

==Diagnosis==
APD is a difficult disorder to detect and diagnose. The subjective symptoms that lead to an evaluation for APD include an intermittent inability to process verbal information, leading the person to guess to fill in the processing gaps. There may also be disproportionate problems with decoding speech in noisy environments.

APD has been defined anatomically in terms of the integrity of the auditory areas of the [[nervous system]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Rintelmann | first1 = W.F. | title = Assessment of central auditory dysfunction : foundations and clinical correlates | chapter = Monaural speech tests in the detection of central auditory disorders. | editors = Marilyn L Pinheiro and Frank E Musiek | publisher = Williams & Wilkins | year = 1985 | location = Baltimore  | pages = 173–200 | accessdate = 2010-09-01 | isbn = 978-0-683-06887-0 | oclc= 11497885 }}</ref> However, children with symptoms of APD typically have no evidence of neurological disease and the diagnosis is made on the basis of performance on behavioral auditory tests. Auditory processing is "what we do with what we hear",<ref name='Katz 1992'>{{cite book | last1 = Katz | first1 = Jack  | title = Central auditory processing : a transdisciplinary view  | chapter = Classification of auditory processing disorders | editors = Jack Katz and Nancy Austin Stecker and Donald Henderson  | publisher = Mosby Year Book | year = 1992 | location = St. Louis | pages = 81–92 | accessdate = 2010-09-01 | isbn = 978-1-55664-372-9| oclc= 25877287 }}</ref> and in APD there is a mismatch between peripheral hearing ability (which is typically normal) and ability to interpret or discriminate sounds. Thus in those with no signs of neurological impairment, APD is diagnosed on the basis of auditory tests. There is, however, no consensus as to which tests should be used for diagnosis, as evidenced by the succession of task force reports that have appeared in recent years. The first of these occurred in 1996.<ref name=cap1996/> This was followed by a conference organized by the American Academy of Audiology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jerger J, Musiek F |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467–74 |year=2000 |month=October |pmid=11057730 |doi= | url=http://www.taracentar.hr/download/diagnosis_apd_school.pdf  | format = pdf}}</ref> Experts attempting to define diagnostic criteria have to grapple with the problem that a child may do poorly on an auditory test for reasons other than poor auditory perception: for instance, failure could be due to inattention, difficulty in coping with task demands, or limited language ability. In an attempt to rule out at least some of these factors, the American Academy of Audiology conference explicitly advocated that for APD to be diagnosed, the child must have a modality-specific problem, i.e. affecting auditory but not visual processing. However, an ASHA committee subsequently rejected modality-specificity as a defining characteristic of auditory processing disorders.<ref name='ASHA 2005'/>

The issue of modality-specificity has led to considerable debate among experts in this field.  Cacace and McFarland have argued that APD should be defined as a ''modality-specific'' perceptual dysfunction that is not due to peripheral hearing loss.<ref name='Cacace McFarland 1995'>{{cite journal | title = Opening Pandora's Box: The Reliability of CAPD Tests | journal = American Journal of Audiology | date = 1995-07 | first = Anthony T.  | last = Cacace | coauthors = Dennis J.

It is also impractical, as audiologists do not have access to standardized tests that are visual analogs of auditory tests. The debate over this issue remains unresolved. It is clear, however, that a modality-specific approach will diagnose fewer children with APD than a modality-general one, and that the latter approach runs a risk of including children who fail auditory tests for reasons other than poor auditory processing.

Another controversy concerns the fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials.<ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'>{{cite journal | title = Auditory processing disorder (APD): Definition, diagnosis, neural basis, and intervention   | journal = Audiological Medicine | year = 2006 | first = David R. | last =  Moore | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–11| doi =  10.1080/16513860600568573 | accessdate = 2010-08-31}}</ref> The British Society of Audiology<ref name='BSA2011'/> has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of ''non-speech sounds''.<ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/> The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.

In recent years there have been additional criticisms of some popular tests for diagnosis of APD. Tests that use tape-recorded American English have been shown to over-identify APD in speakers of other forms of English.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The SCAN-C in testing for auditory processing disorder in a sample of British children.|first1=P|last1=Dawes |first2=D.V. M.|last2=Bishop|year=2007|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=46|pages=780–786|doi=10.1080/14992020701545906}}</ref> Performance on a battery of non-verbal auditory tests devised by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]'s Institute of Hearing Research was found to be heavily influenced by non-sensory task demands, and indices of APD had low reliability when this was controlled for.<ref name='Moore2010'>{{cite journal|title=Nature of auditory processing disorder in children.|first1=D.R.|last1=Moore|first2=M.A.|last2=Ferguson|first3=A.M.|last3=Edmondson-Jones|first4=S|last4=Ratib|first5=A|last5=Riley|year=2010|journal=Pediatrics|volume=126|issue=2|pages=e382-390|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2826}}</ref>

Depending on how it is defined, APD may share common symptoms with [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD/ADHD]], [[Specific language impairment]], [[Asperger syndrome]] and other forms of [[autism]]. A review showed substantial evidence for atypical processing of auditory information in autistic children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Connor K |title=Auditory processing in autism spectrum disorder: A review |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume= 36|issue= 2|pages= 836–54|year=2011 |month=December |pmid=22155284 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.11.008 |url=}}</ref> Dawes and Bishop noted how specialists in audiology and speech-language pathology often adopted different approaches to child assessment, and they concluded their review as follows: "We regard it as crucial that these different professional groups work together in carrying out assessment, treatment and management of children and undertaking cross-disciplinary research."<ref name='Dawes & Bishop(2009)'/> In practice, this seems rare.

==Causes: Acquired Auditory Processing Disorder==
Acquired APD is not a unitary disorder. Any damage to or dysfunction of the central auditory nervous system can cause auditory processing problems.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Musiek FE, Chermak GD, Weihing J, Zappulla M, Nagle S |title=Diagnostic accuracy of established central auditory processing test batteries in patients with documented brain lesions |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=342–58 |year=2011 |month=June |pmid=21864472 |doi=10.3766/jaaa.22.6.4 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lew HL, Weihing J, Myers PJ, Pogoda TK, Goodrich GL |title=Dual sensory impairment (DSI) in traumatic brain injury (TBI)--An emerging interdisciplinary challenge |journal=NeuroRehabilitation |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=213–22 |year=2010 |pmid=20448311 |doi=10.3233/NRE-2010-0557 |url=}}</ref> For an overview of neurological aspects of APD, see Griffiths.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=T.

==Causes: Developmental Auditory Processing Disorder==
In the majority of cases of developmental APD, the cause is unknown. An exception is acquired epileptic [[aphasia]] or [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]], where a child's development regresses, with language comprehension severely affected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fandiño M, Connolly M, Usher L, Palm S, Kozak FK |title=Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a rare auditory processing disorder series of cases and review of the literature |journal=Int.

In the 1980s and 1990s, there was considerable interest in the role of chronic [[Otitis media]] (middle ear disease or 'glue ear') in causing APD and related language and literacy problems. Otitis media with effusion is a very common childhood disease that causes a fluctuating conductive hearing loss, and there was concern this may disrupt auditory development if it occurred during a sensitive period.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Whitton JP, Polley DB |title=Evaluating the perceptual and pathophysiological consequences of auditory deprivation in early postnatal life: a comparison of basic and clinical studies |journal=J.

==Characteristics==

The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/auditory.html |title=Auditory Processing Disorder in Children [NIDCD Health Information] |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> state that children with Auditory Processing Disorder often:
* have trouble paying attention to and remembering information presented orally, and may cope better with visually acquired information
* have problems carrying out multi-step directions given orally; need to hear only one direction at a time
* have poor listening skills
* need more time to process information
* have low academic performance
* have behavior problems
* have language difficulties (e.g., they confuse syllable sequences and have problems developing vocabulary and understanding language)
* have difficulty with reading, comprehension, spelling, and vocabulary

APD can manifest as problems determining the direction of sounds, difficulty perceiving differences between speech sounds and the sequencing of these sounds into meaningful words, confusing similar sounds such as "hat" with "bat", "there" with "where", etc.  Fewer words may be perceived than were actually said, as there can be problems detecting the gaps between words, creating the sense that someone is speaking unfamiliar or nonsense words. Those suffering from APD may have problems relating what has been said with its meaning, despite obvious recognition that a word has been said, as well as repetition of the word.  Background noise, such as the sound of a radio, television or a noisy bar can make it difficult to impossible to understand speech, since spoken words may sound distorted either into irrelevant words or words that don't exist, depending on the severity of the auditory processing disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson S, Kraus N |title=Sensory-cognitive interaction in the neural encoding of speech in noise: a review |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=575–85 |year=2010 |month=October |pmid=21241645 |pmc=3075209 |doi=10.3766/jaaa.21.9.3 |url=}}</ref> Using a telephone can be problematic for someone with auditory processing disorder, in comparison with someone with normal auditory processing, due to low quality audio, poor signal, intermittent sounds and the chopping of words.<ref name='ASHA 2005'/> Many who have auditory processing disorder subconsciously develop visual coping strategies, such as lip reading, reading body language, and eye contact, to compensate for their auditory deficit, and these coping strategies are not available when using a telephone.

As noted above, the status of APD as a distinct disorder has been queried, especially by speech-language pathologists<ref name='Kamhi2011'>{{cite journal|first=A.G.|last=Kamhi|year=2011|title= What speech-language pathologists need to know about Auditory Processing Disorder.|journal=Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools|volume= 42|issue=3|pages=265–272|doi=10.1044/0161-1461(2010/10-0004)}}</ref> and psychologists,<ref name='Lovett2011'>{{cite journal|last=Lovett|first=B.J.|year=2011|title=Auditory processing disorder: School psychologist beware?|journal=Psychology in the Schools|volume=48|pages=855–867|doi=10.1002/pits.20595}}</ref> who note the overlap between clinical profiles of children diagnosed with APD and those with other forms of specific learning disability. Many audiologists, however, would dispute that APD is just an alternative label for dyslexia, SLI, or ADHD, noting that although it often co-occurs with these conditions, it can be found in isolation.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Hearing Journal|year=

==Relation to Specific language impairment and Developmental Dyslexia==

There has been considerable debate over the relationship between APD and [[Specific language impairment|Specific language impairment (SLI)]].

SLI is diagnosed when a child has difficulties with understanding or producing spoken language for no obvious cause. The problems cannot be explained in terms of peripheral hearing loss. The child is typically late in starting to talk, and may have problems in producing speech sounds clearly, and in producing or understanding complex sentences. Some theoretical accounts of SLI regard it as the result of auditory processing problems.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=C. A.|year=2011|title= Auditory processing theories of language disorders: Past, present, and future.|journal=Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools|volume=42|issue=3|pages=309–319|doi= 10.1044/0161-1461(2011/10-0040)}}</ref><ref name="Ferguson, 2011">{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1= M. A.|last2=Hall|first2=R. L.|last3= Riley|first3=A|last4= Moore|first4= D. R.|year=2011|title=Communication, listening, cognitive and speech perception skills in children with auditory processing disorder (APD) or specific language impairment (SLI)|journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research|volume= 54|issue=1|pages=211–227| doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2010/09-0167)}}</ref> However, this view of SLI is not universally accepted, and others regard the main difficulties in SLI as stemming from problems with higher-level aspects of language processing. Where a child has both auditory and language problems, it can be hard to sort out cause-and-effect.<ref name="Ferguson, 2011"/>

Similarly with [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]], there has been considerable interest in the idea that for some children reading problems are downstream consequences of difficulties in rapid auditory processing. Again, cause and effect can be hard to unravel. This is one reason why experts such as Moore<ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/> have recommended using non-verbal auditory tests to diagnose APD.

It has also been suggested that APD may be related to [[cluttering]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Pindzola, Rebekah H.; Haynes, William O.; Moran, Michael J. |title=Communication disorders in the classroom: an introduction for professionals in school setting |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=Boston |year=2006 |pages=251 |isbn=0-7637-2743-1 |oclc=59401841 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> a fluency disorder marked by word and phrase repetitions.

If, as is commonly done, APD is assessed using tests that involve identifying, repeating or discriminating speech, then a child may do poorly because of primary language problems.<ref name='Dawes & Bishop(2009)'/> In a study comparing children with a diagnosis of dyslexia and those with a diagnosis of APD, they found the two groups could not be distinguished.<ref name="Ferguson, 2011"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dawes|first1=P|last2=Bishop|first2= D|year=2010|title=Psychometric profile of children with auditory processing disorder (APD) and children with dyslexia|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=95|pages=432–436|doi=10.1136/adc.2009.170118}}

This raises the worrying possibility that the diagnosis that a child receives may be largely a function of the specialist they see: the same child who would be diagnosed with APD by an audiologist may be diagnosed with SLI by a speech-language therapist or with dyslexia by a psychologist.<ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/>

==Remediation and training==

{{See also|Alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities}}

There is a lack of well-conducted evaluations of intervention using [[randomized controlled trial]] methodology. Most evidence for effectiveness adopts weaker standards of evidence, such as showing that performance improves after training. This does not control for possible influences of practice, maturation, or placebo effects. Recent research has shown that practice with basic auditory processing tasks (i.e. auditory training) may improve performance on auditory processing measures<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chermak GD, Silva ME, Nye J, Hasbrouck J, Musiek FE |title=An update on professional education and clinical practices in central auditory processing |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=428–52; quiz 455 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17715652 |doi= 10.3766/jaaa.18.5.7|url=}}</ref><ref name=MooreDR2007 >{{cite journal |author=Moore DR |title=Auditory processing disorders: acquisition and treatment |journal=J Commun Disord |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=295–304 |year=2007 |pmid=17467002 |doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2007.03.005 |url=}}</ref> and phonemic awareness measures.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moore DR, Rosenberg JF, Coleman JS |title=Discrimination training of phonemic contrasts enhances phonological processing in mainstream school children |journal=Brain Lang |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=72–85 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15896385 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.11.009 |url=}}</ref>  Changes after auditory training have also been recorded at the physiological level.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Russo NM, Nicol TG, Zecker SG, Hayes EA, Kraus N |title=Auditory training improves neural timing in the human brainstem |journal=Behav.

Treating additional issues related to APD can result in success. For example, treatment for phonological disorders (difficulty in speech) can result in success in terms of both the phonological disorder as well as APD. In one study, speech therapy improved auditory [[evoked potential]]s (a measure of brain activity in the auditory portions of the brain).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leite RA, Wertzner HF, Matas CG |title=Long latency auditory evoked potentials in children with phonological disorder |journal=Pró-fono : Revista De Atualização Científica |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=561–6 |year=2010 |pmid=21271117 |doi= |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0104-56872010000400034&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref>
