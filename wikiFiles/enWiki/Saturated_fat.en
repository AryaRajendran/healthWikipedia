{{Fats}}
'''Saturated fat''' is [[fat]] that consists of [[triglyceride]]s containing only [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] [[fatty acid]]s. ''Saturated'' fatty acids have no [[double bond]]s between the individual [[carbon]] [[atom]]s of the fatty acid chain. That is, the chain of carbon atoms is fully "saturated" with [[hydrogen]] atoms. There are many kinds of naturally occurring saturated fatty acids, which differ mainly in number of carbon atoms, from 3 carbons ([[propionic acid]]) to 36 (hexatriacontanoic acid).

Various fats contain different proportions of saturated and [[unsaturated fat]]. Examples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat include animal fats such as [[cream]], [[cheese]], [[butter]], and [[ghee]]; [[suet]], [[tallow]], [[lard]], and fatty [[meat]]s;  as well as certain vegetable products such as [[coconut oil]], [[cottonseed oil]], [[palm kernel oil]], [[chocolate]], and many prepared foods.<ref>[http://www.dietaryfiberfood.com/fat-saturated.php Saturated fat food sources]</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=April 2010}}

==Fat profiles==
While nutrition labels regularly combine them, the saturated fatty acids appear in different proportions among food groups.  [[Lauric acid|Lauric]] and [[Myristic acid|myristic]] acids are most commonly found in "tropical" oils (e.g., [[Palm kernel oil|palm kernel]], [[Coconut oil|coconut]]) and dairy products.  The saturated fat in meat, [[egg (food)|eggs]], chocolate, and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] is primarily the triglycerides of [[Palmitic acid|palmitic]] and [[Stearic acid|stearic]] acids.

==Examples of saturated fatty acids==
{{Main|List of saturated fatty acids}}
Some common examples of fatty acids:
*[[Butyric acid]] with 4 carbon atoms (contained in [[butter]])
*[[Lauric acid]] with 12 carbon atoms (contained in [[coconut oil]], [[palm kernel oil]], and [[breast milk]])
*[[Myristic acid]] with 14 carbon atoms (contained in cow's [[milk]] and dairy products)
*[[Palmitic acid]] with 16 carbon atoms (contained in [[palm oil]] and [[meat]])
*[[Stearic acid]] with 18 carbon atoms (also contained in [[meat]] and [[cocoa butter]])

==Association with diseases==

Since the 1950s, it has been commonly believed that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids.  Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, safflower, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oils.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fat/NU00262 | title = Dietary fats: Know which types to choose | publisher = [[Mayo Clinic]] | date = 2011-02-15 | accessdate = 2011-09-02 }}</ref>

===Bones===
Mounting evidence indicates that the amount and type of fat in the diet can have important effects on bone health. Most of this evidence is derived from animal studies. The data from one study indicated that bone mineral density is negatively associated with saturated fat intake, and that men may be particularly vulnerable.<ref>{{cite pmid | 16365076}}</ref>

A 2004 statement released by the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) determined that "Americans need to continue working to reduce saturated fat intake…"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/mmwrnews/n040206.htm#mmwr2 | title = Trends in Intake of Energy, Protein, Carbohydrate, Fat, and Saturated Fat — United States, 1971–2000 | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control]] | year = 2004 }}</ref> In addition, reviews by the [[American Heart Association]] led the Association to recommend reducing saturated fat intake to less than 7% of total calories according to its 2006 recommendations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lichtenstein AH, Appel LJ, Brands M, ''et al.'' |title=Diet and lifestyle recommendations revision 2006: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Nutrition Committee |journal=Circulation |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=82–96 |date=July 2006|pmid=16785338 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.176158}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith SC, Jackson R, Pearson TA, ''et al.'' |title=Principles for national and regional guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention: a scientific statement from the World Heart and Stroke Forum |journal=Circulation |volume=109 |issue=25 |pages=3112–21 |date=June 2004|pmid=15226228 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000133427.35111.67}}</ref> This concurs with similar conclusions made by the US [[Department of Health and Human Services]], which determined that reduction in saturated fat consumption would positively affect health and reduce the prevalence of heart disease.<ref name=DGfA>{{cite web | publisher = [[United States Department of Agriculture]] | url = http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/06q0458/06q-0458-sup0001-02.pdf | format = pdf | title = Dietary Guidelines for Americans | year = 2005}}</ref>

In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) expert consultation report concluded that "intake of saturated fatty acids is directly related to cardiovascular risk. The traditional target is to restrict the intake of saturated fatty acids to less than 10% of daily energy intake and less than 7% for high-risk groups. If populations are consuming less than 10%, they should not increase that level of intake. Within these limits, intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be replaced by fats with a lower content of these particular fatty acids. In developing countries, however, where energy intake for some population groups may be inadequate, energy expenditure is high and body fat stores are low (BMI <18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The amount and quality of fat supply has to be considered keeping in mind the need to meet energy requirements.  Specific sources of saturated fat, such as coconut and palm oil, provide low-cost energy and may be an important source of energy for the poor."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/hpr/NPH docs/who_fao_expert_report.pdf | title = Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases (WHO technical report series 916) | publisher = World Health Organization | author = Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation | year = 2003 | pages=81–94 | isbn = 92-4-120916-X | accessdate = 2011-03-11}}</ref>

Dr. German and Dr. Dillard of University of California and Nestle Research Center in Switzerland, in their 2004 review, pointed out that "no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified" and recommended that the influence of varying saturated fatty acid intakes against a background of different individual lifestyles and genetic backgrounds should be the focus in future studies.<ref name=German>{{Cite journal | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/80/3/550.full | title = Saturated fats: what dietary intake? | last1 = German | first1 = J Bruce | last2 = Dillard | first2 = Cora J | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 550–559 | month = September | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2010-12-27 | pmid = 15321792}}</ref>

Blanket recommendations to lower saturated fat were criticized at a 2010 conference debate of the [[American Dietetic Association]] for focusing too narrowly on reducing saturated fats rather than emphasizing increased consumption of healthy fats and unrefined carbohydrates.  Concern was expressed over the health risks of replacing saturated fats in the diet with refined carbohydrates, which carry a high risk of obesity and heart disease, particularly at the expense of [[polyunsaturated fat]]s which may have health benefits.  None of the panelists recommended heavy consumption of saturated fats, emphasizing instead the importance of overall dietary quality to cardiovascular health.<ref>{{cite pmid | 21515106 }}</ref>

==Molecular description==
[[File:Myristic acid.png|thumb|left|500px|Two-dimensional representation of the saturated fatty acid [[myristic acid]]]]
[[File:Myristic-acid-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|500px|A [[space-filling model]] of the saturated fatty acid [[myristic acid]]]]  It should be noted, as this is the defining factor of '''saturated''' fats, that the two-dimensional illustration has implicit hydrogens bonded to each of the carbon atoms in the polycarbon tail of the [[myristic acid]] molecule (there are 13 carbons in the tail, 14 carbons in the entire molecule).

Carbon atoms are also implicitly drawn, as they are  portrayed as [[Line-line intersection|intersections]] between two straight lines.  "Saturated," in general, refers to a maximum number of hydrogens bonded to each carbon of the polycarbon tail as allowed by the [[Octet Rule]].  This also means that only [[single bond]]s ([[sigma bonds]]) will be present between adjacent carbon atoms of the tail.
