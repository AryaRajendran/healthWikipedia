A '''dermatome''' is an area of [[skin]] that is mainly supplied by a single [[spinal nerve]].
There are eight [[cervical nerves]] (C1 being an exception with no dermatome),
twelve [[thoracic nerves]],
five [[lumbar nerves]] and five [[sacral nerves]].
Each of these nerves relays sensation (including pain) from a particular region of skin to the [[brain]].

Along the [[thorax]] and [[abdomen]] the dermatomes are like a stack of discs forming a human, each supplied by a different spinal nerve. Along the arms and the legs, the pattern is different: the dermatomes run longitudinally along the limbs. Although the general pattern is similar in all people, the precise areas of innervation are as unique to an individual as fingerprints.

A similar area innervated by [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]] is called a [[peripheral nerve field]].

== Clinical significance ==

A dermatome is an area of skin supplied by sensory neurons that arise from a spinal nerve ganglion. Symptoms that follow a dermatome (e.g. like pain or a rash) may indicate a pathology that involves the related nerve root.  Examples include [[somatic dysfunction]] of the spine or viral infection. [[Referred pain]] usually involves a specific, "referred" location so is not associated with a dermatome. 

Viruses that lie dormant in nerve ganglia (e.g. [[Varicella zoster virus]], which causes both [[chickenpox]] and [[herpes zoster]]) often cause either pain, rash or both in a pattern defined by a dermatome.  However, the symptoms may not appear across the entire dermatome.

== Important dermatomes and anatomical landmarks ==
Following is a list of [[spinal nerve]]s and points that are characteristically belonging to the dermatome of each nerve:<ref>[http://www.asia-spinalinjury.org/publications/Key_Sensory_Points.pdf Key Sensory Points] from International Standards for the Classification of Spinal Cord Injury.
