==History==

The 44th Medical Brigade was formed on 30 December 1965 and was activated on 1 January 1966 at [[Fort Sam Houston]], Texas. The brigade deployed to [[Vietnam]], where it participated in 12 of the 17 campaigns, including Counteroffensive, Counteroffensive Phases II through VII, Tet Counteroffensive; Summer-Fall 1969; Winter-Spring 1970, and the
Sanctuary Counteroffensive.

In March, 1970, the 44th Medical Brigade merged with the [[United States Army, Vietnam Surgeon’s Office]] to form the [[Medical Command, Vietnam (Provisional)]]. The brigade's colors returned to the United States in December 1970. During the brigade’s Vietnam tour, it was awarded two [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] Streamers embroidered “Vietnam 1969–1970” by the government of the [[Republic of Vietnam]].

On 19 March 1973, the 44th Medical Brigade was inactivated at [[Fort Meade]], [[Maryland]]. The brigade was reactivated on 21 September 1974 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, assigned to the [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]]. The 44th Medical Brigade deployed in support of XVIII Airborne Corps operations in [[Operation Urgent Fury|Grenada]], [[Operation Just Cause|Panama]], and [[Operation Desert Storm|Iraq]], the last of which earned the brigade a Meritorious Unit Commendation. On 16 July 1993, the brigade became a separate major subordinate command with a general officer commanding. Following the reorganization, the 44th Medical Brigade participated in [[Operation Uphold Democracy]], [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], and most recently, [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. The brigade has also participated in hurricane relief efforts, including those following [[Hurricane Andrew]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], and [[Hurricane Rita]]. The brigade was converted to a Medical Command on 16 October 2001 and became a multi-component unit. While at Fort Bragg the brigade had become an Airborne unit, but as part of its conversion the 44th lost this designation. Only headquarters elements and a very limited number of its subordinate units had actually been on jump status, and the reorganization to a command removed headquarters elements from jump status. Currently the unit is redesignated as 44th Medical Brigade on 21 April 2010.
