'''Fluoride''' is the [[anion]] F<sup>−</sup>, the [[Redox|reduced]] form of [[fluorine]] when as an ion and when bonded to another element. [[Inorganic compound|Inorganic]] fluorine containing compounds are called fluorides. Fluoride, like other [[halide]]s, is a monovalent ion (−1 charge). Its compounds often have properties that are distinct relative to other halides. Structurally, and to some extent chemically, the fluoride [[ion]] resembles the [[hydroxide]] ion.

Solutions of inorganic fluorides in water contain F<sup>−</sup> and [[bifluoride]] {{chem|HF|2|-}}.<ref>Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. ISBN 0-12-352651-5.</ref>  Few inorganic fluorides are soluble in water without undergoing significant hydrolysis. In terms of its reactivity, fluoride differs significantly from [[chloride]] and other halides, and is more strongly solvated due to its smaller radius/charge ratio.

Naked fluoride is a very strong [[Lewis base]].<ref>Schwesinger, Reinhard; Link, Reinhard; Wenzl, Peter; Kossek, Sebastian "Anhydrous phosphazenium fluorides as sources for extremely reactive fluoride ions in solution" Chemistry&mdash;A European Journal (2006), Volume Date2005, 12(2), 438-445.  {{DOI|10.1002/chem.200500838}}</ref>  The presence of fluoride and its compounds can be detected by [[Fluorine-19 NMR|<sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy]].

===Natural occurrence===
Many fluoride minerals are known, but of paramount commercial importance are [[fluorite]] and [[fluorapatite]].<ref name=Aigueperse/>

Fluoride is usually found naturally in low concentration in drinking water and foods. The concentration in seawater averages 1.3 [[parts per million]] (ppm). Fresh water supplies generally contain between 0.01–0.3 ppm, whereas the ocean contains between 1.2 and 1.5 ppm.<ref>[http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc227.htm#5.0 Environmental Health Criteria 227: Fluorides]. World Health Organization, 2002, page 38.

World Health Organization, 2004, page 2. Page accessed on February 22, 2007.</ref>  In some locations, the fresh water contains dangerously high levels of fluoride, leading to serious [[Fluoride toxicity#Chronic toxicity|health problems]].

==Applications==
Fluorides are pervasive in modern technology. [[Hydrofluoric acid]] is the fluoride synthesized on the largest scale. It is produced by treating fluoride minerals with [[sulfuric acid]]. Hydrofluoric acid and its anhydrous form hydrogen fluoride are used in the production of [[fluorocarbons]] and aluminium fluorides. Hydrofluoric acid has a variety of specialized applications, including its ability to dissolve glass.<ref name=Aigueperse>{{Ullmann | book | first = Jean | last = Aigueperse |  coauthors = Mollard, Paul; Devilliers, Didier; Chemla, Marius; Faron, Robert; Romano, Renée; Cuer, Jean Pierre | title = Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic| year = 2005 | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a11_307 | page = 307}}</ref>

===Inorganic chemicals===
Fluoride salts are used in the manufacture of many inorganic chemicals, many of which contain fluoride covalently bonded to the metal or nonmetal in question.  Some examples of these are:

<li>[[Cryolite]] (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>) is a pesticide that can leave fluoride on agricultural commodities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/0087fact.pdf  |title= EPA R.E.D.

<li>[[Sulfuryl fluoride]] (SO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) is used as a pesticide and fumigant on agricultural crops. In 2010, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] proposed to withdraw the use of sulfuryl fluoride on food. Sulfuryl fluoride releases fluoride when metabolized.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/sulfuryl-fluoride/questions.html |title= Questions and Answers about EPA’s Sulfuryl Fluoride Actions |author=US EPA |date=5/9/2012 |accessdate=7/5/2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/sulfuryl-fluoride/ |title= Sulfuryl Fluoride |author=US EPA |date=5/9/2012  |accessdate= 7/5/2012}}</ref></li>

<li>[[Sulfur hexafluoride]] is an inert, nontoxic insulator gas that is used in electrical transformers and as a tracer gas in indoor air quality investigations.</li>

<li>[[Uranium hexafluoride]], although not ionic, is prepared from fluoride reagents.  It is utilized in the separation of isotopes of uranium between the [[nuclear fission|fissile]] isotope [[Uranium-235|U-235]] and the non-fissile isotope [[Uranium-238|U-238]] in preparation of [[nuclear reactor]] [[nuclear fuel|fuel]] and [[atomic bomb]]s. This is due to the [[fluoride volatility|volatility of fluorides]] of uranium.</li>

===Organic chemicals===
{{main|Organofluorine chemistry}}
Fluoride reagents are significant in [[organic synthesis|synthetic]] [[organic chemistry]]. [[Organofluorine]] chemistry has produced many useful compounds over the last 50 years.  Included in this area are [[polytetrafluorethylene]] (Teflon), [[polychlorotrifluoroethylene]] (moisture barriers), [[efavirenz]] (pharmaceutical used for treatment of HIV), [[fluoxetine]] (an antidepressant), [[5-fluorouracil]] (an anticancer drug), hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorcarbons (refrigerants, blowing agents and propellants).

Due to the affinity of [[silicon]] for fluoride, and the ability of silicon to expand its coordination number, [[silyl ether]] [[protecting group]]s can be easily removed by the fluoride sources such as [[sodium fluoride]] and [[tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride]] (TBAF). This is quite useful for organic synthesis and the production of fine chemicals. The Si-F linkage is one of the strongest single bonds. In contrast, other silyl halides are easily hydrolyzed.

===Biomedical applications===
[[Positron emission tomography]] is commonly carried out using fluoride-containing pharmaceuticals such as [[fluorodeoxyglucose]], which is labelled with the [[radioactive isotope]] [[fluorine-18]], which emits [[positron]]s when it decays into <sup>18</sup>O.

Numerous drugs contain fluorine including [[antipsychotic]]s such as [[fluphenazine]], [[HIV protease inhibitor]]s such as [[tipranavir]], [[antibiotic]]s such as [[ofloxacin]] and [[trovafloxacin]], and [[anesthetic]]s such as [[halothane]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Park BK, Kitteringham NR, O'Neill PM |title=Metabolism of fluorine-containing drugs |journal=Annu.

==Toxicology==
{{main|Fluoride toxicity}}
[[File:DIF reaction.png|thumb|upright|right|Reaction of the irreversible inhibitor [[diisopropylfluorophosphate]] with a serine protease]]
Fluoride-containing compounds are so diverse that it is not possible to generalize on their [[toxicity]], which depends on their reactivity and structure, and in the case of salts, their solubility and ability to release fluoride ions.

Soluble fluoride salts, of which [[sodium fluoride]] is the most common, are only mildly toxic, although they have resulted in both accidental and suicidal deaths from [[Acute toxicity|acute poisoning]].<ref name=Aigueperse/> The lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10&nbsp;g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64&nbsp;mg/kg elemental fluoride/kg body weight).<ref>{{cite book | last = Gosselin | first = RE | coauthors = Smith RP, Hodge HC | authorlink = | title = Clinical toxicology of commercial products | publisher = Williams & Wilkins| location = Baltimore (MD) | year = 1984 | pages =III–185–93| isbn =0-683-03632-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Baselt | first = RC | coauthors = | authorlink = | title = Disposition of toxic drugs and chemicals in man | publisher = Biomedical Publications| location = Foster City (CA) | year = 2008 | pages =636–40| isbn =978-0-9626523-7-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = IPCS | first =  | coauthors = | authorlink = | title = Environmental health criteria 227 (Fluoride) | publisher = International Programme on Chemical Safety, World Health Organization| location = Geneva | year = 2002 | pages =100| isbn =92-4-157227-2}}</ref> However, a case of a fatal poisoning of an adult with 4&nbsp;grams of sodium fluoride is documented,<ref name=acute/> while a dose of 120&nbsp;g sodium fluoride has been survived.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Abukurah AR, Moser AM Jr, Baird CL, Randall RE Jr, Setter JG, Blanke RV | title=Acute sodium fluoride poisoning | journal=JAMA | year=1972 | pages=816–7 | volume=222 | issue=7 | pmid=4677934 | doi=10.1001/jama.1972.03210070046014}}</ref>  For [[Sodium fluorosilicate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>), the [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>) orally in rats is 0.125 g/kg, corresponding to 12.5&nbsp;g for a 100&nbsp;kg adult.<ref name="merck">The Merck Index, 12th edition, Merck & Co., Inc., 1996</ref> The fatal period ranges from 5 min to 12 hours.<ref name=acute/> The mechanism of toxicity involves the combination of the fluoride anion with the calcium ions in the blood to form insoluble [[calcium fluoride]], resulting in [[hypocalcemia]]; calcium is indispensable for the function of the nervous system, and the condition can be fatal.

In the higher doses used to treat [[osteoporosis]], sodium fluoride can cause pain in the legs and incomplete stress fractures when the doses are too high; it also irritates the stomach, sometimes so severely as to cause ulcers.
