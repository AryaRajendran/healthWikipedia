'''''Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime''''' is a 2007 book written by [[Aubrey de Grey]], a biomedical gerontologist, with his research assistant Michael Rae. ''Ending Aging'' describes de Grey's proposal for eliminating aging as a cause of debilitation and death in humans, and restoring the body to an [[Indefinite lifespan|indefinitely]] youthful state, a project plan that he calls the "[[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]]", or "SENS". De Grey argues that defeating aging is feasible, possibly within a few decades, and he outlines steps that can be taken to hasten the development of  [[regenerative medicine]] treatments that will save lives.
