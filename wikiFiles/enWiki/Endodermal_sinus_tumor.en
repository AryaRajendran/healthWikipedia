'''Endodermal sinus tumor''' ('''EST'''), also known as '''[[yolk sac]] tumor''' ('''YST'''), is a member of the [[germ cell tumor]] group of [[cancer]]s.  It is the most common testicular tumor in children under 3, and is also known as '''infantile embryonal carcinoma'''. This age group has a very good prognosis. In contrast to the pure form typical of infants, adult endodermal sinus tumors are often found in combination with other kinds of germ cell tumor, particularly [[teratoma]] and [[embryonal carcinoma]].  While pure teratoma is usually [[benign]], endodermal sinus tumor is [[malignant]].

==Diagnosis==
The [[histology]] of EST is variable, but usually includes malignant endodermal cells.  These cells secrete [[alpha-fetoprotein]] (AFP), which can be detected in tumor tissue, [[blood plasma|serum]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[urine]] and, in the rare case of fetal EST, in [[amniotic fluid]].  When there is incongruence between [[biopsy]] and AFP test results for EST, the result indicating presence of EST dictates treatment.<ref name="pmid16598424">{{cite journal

}}</ref>  This is because EST often occurs as small "malignant foci" within a larger tumor, usually [[teratoma]], and biopsy is a sampling method;  biopsy of the tumor may reveal only teratoma, whereas elevated AFP reveals that EST is also present.  GATA-4, a [[transcription factor]], also may be useful in the diagnosis of EST.<ref name="pmid10595911">{{cite journal | author = Siltanen S, Anttonen M, Heikkilä P, Narita N, Laitinen M, Ritvos O, Wilson DB, Heikinheimo M| title = Transcription Factor GATA-4 Is Expressed in Pediatric Yolk Sac Tumors| journal = Am.

Diagnosis of EST in [[Pregnancy|pregnant women]] and in [[infant]]s is complicated by the extremely high levels of AFP in those two groups.  Tumor surveillance by monitoring AFP requires accurate correction for gestational age in pregnant women, and age in infants.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  In pregnant women, this can be achieved simply by testing [[Alpha-fetoprotein#Maternal serum|maternal serum AFP]] rather than [[Alpha-fetoprotein#Tumor marker|tumor marker AFP]].  In infants, the tumor marker test is used, but must be interpreted using a reference table or graph of normal AFP in infants.

===Pathology===
EST are can have a multitude of morphologic patterns including: reticular, endodermal sinus-like, microcystic, papillary, solid, glandular, alveolar, polyvesicular vitelline, enteric and hepatoid.

[[Schiller-Duval bodies]] on [[histology]] are [[pathognomonic]] and seen in the context of the endodermal sinus-like pattern.

==Treatment==
Most treatments involve some combination of [[surgery]] and [[chemotherapy]]. Treatment with [[cisplatin]], [[etoposide]], and [[bleomycin]] has been described.<ref name="pmid17267887">{{cite journal |author=Motegi M, Takakura S, Takano H, Tanaka T, Ochiai K |title=Adjuvant chemotherapy in a pregnant woman with endodermal sinus tumor of the ovary |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=109 |issue=2 Pt2 |pages=537–40 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17267887 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000245450.62758.47 |url=}}</ref>

Before modern chemotherapy, this type of neoplasm was highly lethal, but the prognosis has significantly improved since.

When treated promptly with surgery and chemotherapy, death from endodermal sinus tumors is exceedingly rare.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1015422|Prepubertal Testicular and Paratesticular Tumors }}</ref>
