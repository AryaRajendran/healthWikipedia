'''Street Doctor''' is a prime-time health series which was first shown in January 2007 on [[BBC One]] television.  

The format involves four [[General practitioner|GP]]s who take to the streets to diagnose, advise and treat people wherever they might be—at work or out and about.  Locations have included high streets, ferries, restaurants, factories, markets, theatres, sports grounds, the [[Great North Run]], race courses and the [[ballet]].

The four GPs who appear in the show are Dr [[Ayan Panja]], Dr [[Jonty Heaversedge]], Dr Barbara Murray, and [[BMA]] council member Dr [[George Rae]].  They are all full time GPs practising in the United Kingdom. The second series visited [[Nottingham]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Manchester]], [[London]], [[Bristol]], [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[York]], using locations such as [[Covent Garden]] and the [[Royal Exchange Theatre]].

A spin-off from the show called ''Beach Doctor'' was also commissioned and was shown as part of BBC One's ''[[The One Show]]'' in August 2007.  ''Street Doctor'' had originally been made as a pilot and was commissioned independently of ''[[The One Show]]'' despite being promoted on it in 2006{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}.  

Many elements of ''Street Doctor'' 's format have been emulated by various strands and shows on both the BBC and other channels{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}.

The show has been estimated to attract around 4 million viewers <ref>{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/stockportexpress/news/s/523178_healthy_ratings_for_tvs_street_doctor.html|title=Healthy ratings for TV’s street doctor|work=Stockport Express|date=7 February 2007|last=Scapens|first=Alex|publisher=M.E.N.
