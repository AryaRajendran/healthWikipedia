A '''paraganglioma''' is rare [[neuroendocrine tumour|neuroendocrine]] [[neoplasm]] that may develop at various body sites (including the head, neck, thorax and abdomen). About 97% are benign and  cured by surgical removal; the remaining 3% are malignant because they are able to produce distant [[metastasis|metastases]]. "Paraganglioma" is now the most-widely accepted term for these lesions, that have been also described as: glomus tumor, chemodectoma, perithelioma, fibroangioma, and sympathetic nevi.<ref name="pmid10555678">{{cite journal |author=Rao AB,et al|title=Paragangliomas of the Head and Neck: Radiologic-Pathologic Correlation |journal=Radiographics|volume=119 |pages=1605–32 |year=1999 |pmid=10555678 }}</ref>
==Cellular origin and classification==
Paragangliomas originate from paraganglia in chromaffin-negative [[glomus cell]]s derived from the [[embryo]]nic [[neural crest]], functioning as part of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] (a branch of the [[autonomic nervous system]]). These cells normally act as special [[chemoreceptor]]s located along blood vessels, particularly in the [[carotid body|carotid bodies]] (at the bifurcation of the [[carotid artery|common carotid artery]] in the neck) and in [[aortic body|aortic bodies]] (near the [[aorta|aortic arch]]).

Accordingly, paragangliomas are categorised as originating from a neural cell line in the [[World Health Organization]] classification of [[neuroendocrine tumors]]. In the categorization proposed by Wick, paragangliomas belong to group II.<ref name="pmid10705811">{{cite journal |author=Wick MR |title=Neuroendocrine neoplasia. Current concepts |journal=Am. J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=331–5 |year=2000 |pmid=10705811 |doi=10.1309/ETJ3-QBUK-13QD-J8FP}}</ref> Given the fact that they originate from cells of the orthosympathetic system, paragangliomas are closely related to [[pheochromocytoma]]s, which however are chromaffin-positive.

==Clinical presentation==
Most paragangliomas are either asymptomatic or present as a painless mass. While all contain neurosecretory granules, only in 1–3% of cases is secretion of hormones such as [[catecholamines]] abundant enough to be clinically significant; in that case manifestations often resemble those of [[phaeochromocytoma]]s.

==Inheritance==
About 75% of paragangliomas are sporadic; the remaining 25% are hereditary (and have an increased likelihood of being multiple and of developing at an earlier age). Mutations of the genes for the [[succinate dehydrogenase]], [[SDHD]] (previously known as PGL1), [[SDHA]], [[SDHC (gene)|SDHC]] (previously PGL3) and [[SDHB]] have been identified as causing familial head and neck paragangliomas. Mutations of [[SDHB]] play an important role in familial adrenal pheochromocytoma and extra-adrenal paraganglioma (of abdomen and thorax), although there is considerable overlap in the types of tumors associated with SDHB and SDHD gene mutations. Paragangliomas may also occur in [[multiple endocrine neoplasia|MEN]] type 2A and 2B. They are seen in at a higher incidence in people living at high altitude. Other genes related to familiar paraganglioma are [[SDHAF2]], [[VHL]], [[NF1]], [[TMEM127]] and [[MAX]].

==Pathology==
[[Image:Mediastinal paraganglioma.jpg|thumb|Mediastinal paraganglioma. The cut surface of a 3.9 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm tumor is triangular, with a bulging peripheral portion and a somewhat fibrotic center. It was surrounded by the heart, left lower lobe of the lung, aorta, esophagus, and diaphragm, and had been 1.8 cm in diameter 7 years before.]]
[[Image:Carotid body tumour 2 high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a ''carotid body tumor'' with the characteristic ''Zellballen''. [[H&E stain]].]]
The paragangliomas appear grossly as sharply circumscribed polypoid masses and they have a firm to rubbery consistency.  They are highly [[vascular tumor]]s and may have a deep red color.

On microscopic inspection, the tumor cells are readily recognized. Individual tumor cells are polygonal to oval and are arranged in distinctive cell balls, called ''[[Zellballen]]''.<ref name="pmid17479683">{{cite journal |author=Kairi-Vassilatou E, Argeitis J, Nika H, Grapsa D, Smyrniotis V, Kondi-Pafiti A |title=Malignant paraganglioma of the urinary bladder in a 44-year-old female: clinicopathological and immunohistochemical study of a rare entity and literature review |journal=Eur. J. Gynaecol. Oncol. |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=149–51 |year=2007 |pmid=17479683 |doi=}}</ref>  These cell balls are separated by fibrovascular stroma and surrounded by sustentacular cells.  

By light microscopy, the differential diagnosis includes related neuroendocrine tumors, such as [[carcinoid tumor]], [[neuroendocrine carcinoma]], and [[medullary carcinoma of the thyroid]].

With [[immunohistochemistry]], the chief cells located in the cell balls are positive for [[chromogranin]], [[synaptophysin]], [[neuron specific enolase]], [[serotonin]], [[neurofilament]] and [[Neural cell adhesion molecule]]; they are [[S-100 protein]] negative. The sustentacular cells are S-100 positive and focally positive for [[Glial fibrillary acidic protein]]. By [[histochemistry]], the paraganglioma cells are argyrophilic, [[periodic acid Schiff]] negative, [[mucicarmine]] negative, and [[argentaffin]] negative.

==Sites of origin==
About 85% of paragangliomas develop in the abdomen; only 12% develop in the chest and 3% in the head and neck region (the latter are the most likely to be symptomatic). While most are single, rare multiple cases occur (usually in a hereditary syndrome). Paragangliomas are described by their site of origin and are often given special names:-

* '''Carotid paraganglioma''' ([[carotid body]] tumor): Is the most common of the head and neck paragangliomas.  It usually presents as a painless neck mass, but larger tumors may cause cranial nerve palsies, usually of the [[vagus nerve]] and [[hypoglossal nerve]].
* '''Glomus tympanicum''' and '''Glomus jugulare''': Both commonly present as a middle ear mass resulting in [[tinnitus]] (in 80%) and hearing loss (in 60%).  The cranial nerves of the [[jugular foramen]] may be compressed, resulting swallowing difficulty, or ipsilateral weakness of the upper trapezius and sternocleiodomastoid muscles (from compression of the spinal accessory nerve).  These patients present with a reddish bulge behind an intact ear drum.  This condition is also known as the "Red drum".  On application of pressure to the external ear canal with the help of a pneumatic ear speculum the mass could be seen to blanch.  This sign is known as "Brown's sign".
* '''Vagal paraganglioma''': These are the least common of the head and neck paragangliomas.  They usually present as a painless neck mass, but may result in [[dysphagia]] and hoarseness.
* '''Pulmonary paraglioma''': These occur in the [[lung]] and may be either single or multiple.<ref name="da Silva">{{cite journal | last=da Silva | first=RA | coauthors= Gross JL, Haddad FJ et al. | title=Primary pulmonary paraganglioma: case report and literature review | journal=Clinics (São Paulo) | volume=61 | issue=1 | pages=83–86 | month=February | year=2006 | url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1807-59322006000100015&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en | pmid=16532231 | doi=10.1590/S1807-59322006000100015 }}</ref>

* '''Other sites''': Rare sites of involvement are the [[larynx]], nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, [[thyroid]] gland, and the [[thoracic inlet]], as well as the bladder in extremely rare cases.

==Treatment==
The main treatment modalities are [[surgery]], [[embolization]]<ref name="pmid14656575">{{cite journal |author=Carlsen CS, Godballe C, Krogdahl AS, Edal AL |title=Malignant vagal paraganglioma: report of a case treated with embolization and surgery |journal=Auris, nasus, larynx |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=443–6 |year=2003 |pmid=14656575 |doi=10.1016/S0385-8146(03)00066-X}}</ref> and [[radiotherapy]].<ref name="pmid15630855">{{cite journal |author=Pitiakoudis M, Koukourakis M, Tsaroucha A, Manavis J, Polychronidis A, Simopoulos C |title=Malignant retroperitoneal paraganglioma treated with concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy |journal=Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)) |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=580–1 |year=2004 |pmid=15630855 |doi=}}</ref>
