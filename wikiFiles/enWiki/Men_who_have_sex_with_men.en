'''Men who have sex with men''' (abbreviated as '''MSM''', also known as '''males who have sex with males''') are [[male|male person]]s who engage in sexual activity with members of the same sex, regardless of how they identify themselves; many men choose not to (or cannot for other reasons) accept [[sexual identity|sexual identities]] of [[homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]].<ref name="UNAIDS1">{{cite web|title= UNAIDS: Men who have sex with men|publisher= UNAIDS|url= http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf|accessdate=April 30, 2011}}</ref> The term was created in the 1990s by [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] in order to study the spread of disease among men who have sex with men, regardless of identity.<ref name="UNAIDS1"/>

''MSM'' is often used in medical literature and [[social research]] to describe such men as a group for research studies without considering issues of self-identification.

==As a constructed behavioral category==
The term had been in use in [[public health]] discussions, especially in the context of [[HIV/AIDS]], since 1990 or earlier, but the coining of the [[initialism]] by Glick ''et al.'' in 1994 "signaled the crystallization of a new concept."<ref name="Young Meyer">{{cite journal |author=Young RM, Meyer IH |title=The trouble with "MSM" and "WSW": erasure of the sexual-minority person in public health discourse |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=1144–1149 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15961753 |pmc=1449332 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.046714 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Glick M, Muzyka BC, Salkin LM, Lurie D |title=Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis: a marker for immune deterioration and a predictor for the diagnosis of AIDS |journal=J. Periodontol. |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=393–7 |year=1994 |month=May |pmid=7913962 |doi= |url=}}</ref> This [[behavioural]] concept comes from two distinct academic perspectives. First, it was pursued by [[epidemiologists]] seeking behavioral categories that would offer better analytical concepts for the study of disease-risk than identity-based categories (such as "gay", "[[bisexual]]", or "straight"), because a man who self-identifies as gay or bisexual is not necessarily sexually active with men, and someone who identifies as straight might be sexually active with men. Second, its usage is tied to criticism of [[sexual identity]] terms prevalent in [[social construction]] literature which typically rejected the use of identity-based concepts across cultural and historical contexts.

MSM are not limited to small, self-identified, and visible sub-populations. ''MSM'' and ''gay'' refer to different things: behaviors and social identities. ''MSM'' refers to sexual activities between men, regardless of how they identify, whereas ''gay'' can include those activities but is more broadly seen as a cultural identity. ''Homosexuality'' refers to sexual/romantic attraction between members of the same sex and may or may not include romantic relationships. ''Gay'' is a social identity and is generally the preferred social term, whereas ''homosexual'' is used in formal contexts, though the terms are not entirely interchangeable. Men who are [[non-heterosexual]] or [[questioning (sexuality)|questioning]] may identify with all, none, a combination of these, or one of the newer terms indicating a similar sexual, romantic, and cultural identity like ''[[bi-curious]]''.

In their assessment of the knowledge about the sexual networks and behaviors of MSM in Asia, Dowsett, Grierson and McNally concluded that the category of MSM does not correspond to a single social identity in any of the countries they studied.<ref name="review">A review of knowledge about the sexual networks and behaviors of men who have sex with men in Asia.

In some countries, homosexual relationships may be illegal or taboo, making MSM difficult to reach.<ref name="msmafrica">{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsportal.org/News_Details.aspx?id=5208&nex=5|title=MSM in Africa: highly stigmatized, vulnerable and in need of urgent HIV prevention}}</ref><ref name=India>{{cite web|url=http://infochangeindia.org/200801116825/Agenda/HIV/AIDS-Big-Questions/Criminalising-high-risk-groups-such-as-MSM.html|title= Criminalizing high-risk groups such as MSM}}</ref>

==Prevalence==
Determining the number of men who have ever had sex with another man is difficult.  Worldwide, at least 3% of men, and perhaps as high as 16% of men, have had sex at least once with a man.<ref>{{cite paper

In the U.S., among men aged 15 to 44, an estimated 6% have engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at some point in their lives, and about 2.9% have had at least one male partner in the previous 12 months.<ref>{{cite paper

==Sexual practices==
Historically, [[anal sex]] has been popularly associated with male homosexuality and MSM. However, many MSM do not engage in anal sex, and may engage in [[oral sex]], [[frot]]ting or other forms of [[mutual masturbation]] instead.<ref name="Dean and Delvin">{{cite web|title=Anal sex|author=Dr. John Dean and Dr. David Delvin|publisher=Netdoctor.co.uk |accessdate=April 29, 2010|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sexandrelationships/analsex.htm}}</ref><ref name="WWW.goaskalice">{{cite web|title=Not all gay men have anal sex |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=May 10, 1996 (Last Updated/Reviewed on June 13, 2008)|accessdate=April 26, 2010|url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/0900.html}}</ref><ref name="Underwood">{{cite book | author =Steven Gregory Underwood|title =Gay men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles|isbn = 1-56023-375-3, 9781560233756|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=225|accessdate=February 12, 2011|url=http://books.google.com/?id=i4wRl0_8NuUC&pg=PA4&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref><ref name="Perez">{{cite book | author =Joe Perez|title=Rising Up|isbn=1-4116-9173-3, 9781411691735|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2006|pages=248|accessdate=March 24, 2011|url=http://books.google.com/?id=caJ7gPv0DrAC&pg=PA191&dq=en#v=onepage&q=Bill%20Weintraub%20anal%20sex&f=false}}</ref> Among those who do have anal sex, the [[Sexual penetration|insertive partner]] is referred to as the ''[[top and bottom|top]]'' or ''active'' partner.

==Health issues==
Since [[LGBT]] people began to organize for their social and legal rights, access to equal health care has remained an important but often not primary issue. LGBT-specific health organizations have been formed, including charities educating on specific issues, health clinics, and even professional organizations for LGBT people and their allies. Many of them have advocated for specific changes to various governmental practices, and the ongoing effort to legalize [[same-sex marriage]] often includes examples of LGBT people unable to secure health coverage equivalent to that of their heterosexual counterparts.

===Mental===
Since medical literature began to describe homosexuality, it has often been approached from a view that assumed or sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause. Much literature on mental health and homosexuals centered on examples of their depression, [[substance abuse]], and suicide. Although these issues exist among [[non-heterosexual]]s, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures are all indications of the issues faced by homosexuals in Western societies, which often adversely affect their mental health.<ref>

===Sexually transmitted infections===

A person who inserts his penis into an infected partner is at risk because STIs can enter through the [[urethra]] or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Also, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/qa22.htm Center for Disease Control; "Can I get HIV from anal sex?"]</ref>
