==History==
===Location===
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1961 as Milan Pharmaceuticals by [[Milan Puskar]] and [[Don Panoz]] in [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia|White Sulphur Springs]], [[West Virginia]]. The company moved to [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[West Virginia]] in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to [[Pittsburgh]] suburb [[Canonsburg]], [[Pennsylvania]], and finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby [[Southpointe]], a suburban business park located in [[Cecil Township, Pennsylvania|Cecil Township]], where it is still located.<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.mylan.com/about_us/company_history.aspx
|title=Mylan 50 years young and still making history
|publisher=Mylan
|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref> The company began as a distributor, but in 1966, Mylan received approval to begin manufacturing [[penicillin G]] [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]].

===Stock===
In 1973, Mylan became a publicly traded company on the [[Over-the-counter (finance)|OTC]] market under the [[ticker symbol]] MYLN, and in 1976 moved to [[NASDAQ]]. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the ticker symbol MYL.  Currently, the stock is traded on the [[NASDAQ]].

===Acquisitions===
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993, and in 1999 renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996. In October 2007 Mylan bought the generics arm of Merck KGaA, and renamed the entire corporation from Mylan Laboratories Inc. to Mylan Inc. In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair® Diskus and Seretide® Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform.<ref>http://www.drugstorenews.com/article/mylan-acquires-rights-pfizers-inhaler-technology, accessed 1 May 2012</ref>

===Pharmaceuticals===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
Mylan discontinued private-label manufacturing in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand. Their first Mylan-invented product, Maxzide, received approval for treating hypertension in 1984, and was the first new drug to be patented by a manufacturer of generic drugs. By 1995, Mylan had become the most dispensed line of pharmaceuticals in America, according to the December 2004 IMS National Prescription Audit. Sales of Mylan's generic drugs exceeded US$1 billion in 2002, and in 2004 Mylan was added to the S&P 500.

In 2011, the company launched a generic version of [[famciclovir]].<ref>{{cite press release

===Legal Issues===
In 1989, CEO Roy McKnight testified before the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, exposing corruption within the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and a number of generic companies.

In 2000, the company agreed to pay $147 million to settle accusations by the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] that they had raised the price of generic [[lorazepam]] by 2600% and generic [[clorazepate]] by 3200%.  Mylan obtained exclusive licensing agreements, in 1998, for certain ingredients.  The company did not admit to any wrongdoing.<ref name = "nyt">
