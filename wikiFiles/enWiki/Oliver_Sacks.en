'''Oliver Wolf Sacks''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 9 July 1933), is a British-American [[biologist]], [[neurologist]], [[writer]], and [[amateur chemistry|amateur chemist]] known as the professor of [[neurology]] and [[psychiatry]] at [[Columbia University]], where he held the position of "Columbia Artist". He spent many years on the clinical faculty of [[Yeshiva University]]'s [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]]. In September 2012, Sacks was appointed clinical professor of neurology at [[NYU Langone Medical Center]], with support from The [[Gatsby Charitable Foundation]]. He also holds the position of visiting professor at the UK's  [[University of Warwick]].<ref name="NYU Langone Medical Center">[http://www.newswise.com/articles/nyu-langone-medical-center-welcomes-neurologist-and-author-oliver-sacks-md "NYU Langone Medical Center Welcomes Neurologist and Author Oliver Sacks, MD"]. newswise.com</ref>

Sacks is the author of numerous best-selling books,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/authors/sacks/index.html|title=Borzoi Reader {{!}} Authors {{!}} Oliver Sacks|work=About the Author|publisher=Random House|accessdate=5 March 2009}}</ref> including several collections of case studies of people with [[neurological disorder]]s. His 1973 book ''[[Awakenings (book)|Awakenings]]'' was adapted into an [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[Awakenings|film of the same name]] in 1990 starring [[Robin Williams]] and [[Robert De Niro]]. He, and his book ''[[Musicophilia|Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain]]'', were the subject of "[[Musical Minds]]", an episode of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]''.

==Early life==
Sacks was the youngest of four children born to a [[North London]] Jewish couple: Samuel Sacks, a physician (died June 1990),<ref>''An Anthropoligist on Mars'' (Knopf, 1995), p. 70</ref> and Muriel Elsie Landau, one of the first female surgeons in England.<ref name="GuardianProfile">{{cite web|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1429477,00.html|title=Oliver Sacks Profile: Seeing double |author=Brown, Andrew|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 March 2005|accessdate=10 August 2008}}</ref> Sacks had a large extended family, and among his first cousins are Israeli statesman [[Abba Eban]], writer and director [[Jonathan Lynn]], and economist [[Robert Aumann]].

When Sacks was six years old he and his brother Michael were evacuated from London to escape the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], retreating to a boarding school in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] where he remained until 1943.<ref name="GuardianProfile"/> He attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London. During his youth he was a keen [[amateur chemist]], as recalled in his memoir ''[[Uncle Tungsten]]''.<ref name="uncle_tungsten">{{Cite book|title=Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|isbn=0-375-40448-1|year=2001}}</ref> He also learned to share his parents' enthusiasm for medicine and entered [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]], [[Oxford University]], in 1951,<ref name="GuardianProfile"/> from which he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) in physiology and biology in 1954.<ref name="CV">{{cite web|url=http://www.oliversacks.com/cv.htm|title=Oliver Sacks, MD, FRCP|accessdate=9 August 2008|publisher=Official site}}</ref> At the same institution, in 1958 he went on to [[Oxbridge MA|undertake a Master of Arts (MA)]] and earn a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|BM BCh]], thereby qualifying to practice medicine. He undertook residencies and fellowship work at [[UCSF Medical Center|Mt. Zion Hospital]] in San Francisco and at [[UCLA]].<ref name="Columbia">[http://asp.cumc.columbia.edu/facdb/profile_list.asp?uni=os2177&DepAffil=Psychiatry Columbia University website, section of Psychiatry]</ref>

==Career==
After converting his British qualifications to American recognition (i.e., an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] as opposed to [[BM BCh]]), Sacks moved to New York, where he has lived and practised neurology since 1965.

Sacks began consulting at chronic care facility Beth Abraham Hospital (now Beth Abraham Health Services), a member of CenterLight Health System in [[Bronx, NY]], in 1966.<ref name="About">{{cite web|url=http://www.oliversacks.com/about.htm|title=Biography . Oliver Sacks, MD, FRCP|accessdate=9 August 2008|publisher=Official website}}</ref> At Beth Abraham, Sacks worked with a group of survivors of the 1920s sleeping sickness, [[encephalitis lethargica]], who had been unable to move on their own for decades.<ref name="About"/> These patients and his treatment of them were the basis of Sacks' book ''[[Awakenings (book)|Awakenings]]''.<ref name="About"/>

Sacks served as an instructor and later clinical professor of neurology at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] from 1966 to 2007, and also held an appointment at the [[New York University School of Medicine]] from 1992 to 2007. In July 2007 he joined the faculty of [[Columbia University Medical Center]] as a professor of neurology and [[psychiatry]].<ref name="Columbia" /> At the same time, he was appointed Columbia University's first "Columbia University Artist" at the University's [[Morningside Heights, New York City|Morningside Heights]] campus, recognising the role of his work in bridging the arts and sciences.

Since 1966 Sacks has served as a neurological consultant to various New York City nursing homes that are run by the [[Little Sisters of the Poor]], and from 1966 to 1991 was a consulting neurologist at Bronx Psychiatric Center. Sacks returned to [[New York University School of Medicine]] in 2012, serving as both a clinical professor of neurology and consulting neurologist in the center's epilepsy center.

Sacks' work at Beth Abraham helped provide the foundation on which the [[Institute for Music and Neurologic Function]] (IMNF) is built; Sacks is currently an honorary medical advisor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bethabe.org/About_the_Institute100.html|title=About the Institute|accessdate=9 August 2008|publisher=Institute for Music and Neurologic Function}}</ref> The Institute honoured Sacks in 2000 with its first ''Music Has Power Award''.<ref>{{cite journal|date=1 January 2006|title=Henry Z.

Sacks remains a consultant neurologist to the Little Sisters of the Poor, and maintains a practice in New York City. He serves on the boards of the [[The Neurosciences Institute]] and the [[New York Botanical Garden]].

===Writing===
Beginning in 1970 Sacks wrote of his experience with neurological patients. His books have been translated into over 25 languages. In addition to his books, Sacks is a regular contributor to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', as well as other medical, scientific, and general publications.<ref name="sacks_newyorker_search">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/search/query?query=authorName:%22Oliver%20Sacks%22|title=Archive: Search: The New Yorker—Oliver Sacks|accessdate=13 August 2008}}</ref><ref name="sacks_newyorkreview_contribs">{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/authors/1246|title=Oliver Sacks—The New York Review of Books|accessdate=13 August 2008}}</ref><ref name="sacks_periodicals">{{cite web|url=http://www.oliversacks.com/peri1.htm|title=Oliver Sacks .

Sacks' work has been featured in a "broader range of media than those of any other contemporary medical author"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/sacks_pr.html|author=Silberman, Steve|title=The Fully Immersive Mind of Oliver Sacks|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=10 August 2008}}</ref> and in 1990, ''[[The New York Times]]'' said he "has become a kind of poet laureate of contemporary medicine".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D8103FF932A35757C0A966958260|date=1 April 1990|title=Good books abut (sic) being sick|author=Broyard, Anatole|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=10 August 2008}}</ref> His descriptions of people coping with and adapting to neurological conditions or injuries often illuminate the ways in which the normal brain deals with perception, memory and individuality.

Sacks considers that his literary style grows out of the tradition of 19th-century "clinical anecdotes," a literary style that included detailed narrative case histories. He also counts among his inspirations the case histories of the Russian neuropsychologist [[A. R. Luria]].<ref name="TranscriptRadioShow">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/mind/stories/s1334384.htm|title=The Inner Life of the Broken Brain: Narrative and Neurology|publisher=[[All in the Mind (Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio)|All in the Mind]]|work=[[Radio National]]|date=2 April 2005|accessdate=10 August 2008}}</ref>

Sacks describes his cases with a wealth of narrative detail, concentrating on the experiences of the patient (in the case of his ''A Leg to Stand On'', the patient was himself). The patients he describes are often able to adapt to their situation in different ways despite the fact that their neurological conditions are usually considered incurable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|title=An Anthropologist on Mars|origyear=1995|edition=New|year=1996 |publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=0-330-34347-5|pages=xiii–xviii|chapter=Preface|quote="The sense of the brain's remarkable plasticity, its capacity for the most striking adaptations, not least in the special (and often desperate) circumstances of neural or sensory mishap, has come to dominate my own perception of my patients and their lives."|nopp=true}}</ref> His most famous book, ''[[Awakenings (book)|Awakenings]]'', upon which the 1990 [[Awakenings|feature film of the same name]] is based, describes his experiences using the new drug [[L-Dopa]] on Beth Abraham [[encephalitis|post-encephalitic]] patients.<ref name="About"/> ''Awakenings'' was also the subject of the first documentary made (in 1974) for the British television series ''[[Discovery (British TV series)|Discovery]]''.

In his other books, he describes cases of [[Tourette syndrome]] and various effects of [[Parkinson's disease]]. The title article of ''[[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]'' is about a man with [[visual agnosia]]<ref>{{cite video

}}</ref>  and was the subject of a 1986 opera by [[Michael Nyman]]. The title article of ''[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]'', which won a [[Polk Award]] for magazine reporting, is about [[Temple Grandin]], a professor with high-functioning [[autism]]. ''[[Seeing Voices]]'', Sacks' 1989 book, covers a variety of topics in [[Hearing impairment|deaf studies]].

In his book ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]'' Sacks writes about an island where many people have [[achromatopsia]] (total colorblindness, very low visual acuity and high photophobia), and describes the [[Chamorro people]] of [[Guam]], who have a high incidence of a neurodegenerative disease known as [[Lytico-Bodig disease]] (a devastating combination of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]], [[dementia]], and [[parkinsonism]]). Along with [[Paul Alan Cox]], Sacks has published papers suggesting a possible environmental cause for the cluster, namely the toxin [[beta-methylamino L-alanine]] (BMAA) from the [[cycad]] nut accumulating by [[biomagnification]] in the [[Pteropus|flying fox bat]].<ref name=Ncbi1>{{cite journal|author=Murch SJ, Cox PA, Banack SA, Steele JC, Sacks OW|title=Occurrence of beta-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) in ALS/PDC patients from Guam|journal=Acta Neurol.

Sacks has sometimes faced criticism in the medical and disability studies communities. During the 1970s and 1980s, his book and articles on the "Awakenings" patients were criticized or ignored by much of the medical establishment, on the grounds that his work was not based on the quantitative, double-blind study model. His account of abilities of autistic savants has been questioned by the researcher Makoto Yamaguchi,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Yamaguchi M|title=Questionable aspects of Oliver Sacks' (1985) report|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|volume=37|issue=7|pages=1396; discussion 1389–9, 1401|year=2007|month=August|pmid=17066308|doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0257-0}} for free access http://secamlocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/mrwatkin/isoc/sacks-yamaguchi.htm</ref> and [[Daniel Tammet]] shared this view. According to Yamaguchi, Sacks' mathematical explanations are also irrelevant.<ref>[http://versita.metapress.com/content/83386k08n2q75g3u/fulltext.pdf ''Polish Psychological Bulletin''], 40, 69–73</ref> [[Arthur K. Shapiro]]—described as "the father of modern [[tic disorder]] research"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gadow KD, Sverd J|title=Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, chronic tic disorder, and methylphenidate|journal=Adv Neurol|year=2006|volume=99|pages=197–207|pmid=16536367}}</ref>—referring to Sacks' celebrity status and that his literary publications received greater publicity than Shapiro's medical publications, said he is "a much better writer than he is a clinician".<ref>Kushner, HI.

ISBN 0-674-00386-1</ref> Howard Kushner's ''A Cursing Brain?: The Histories of Tourette Syndrome'', says Shapiro "contrasted his own careful clinical work with Sacks' idiosyncratic and anecdotal approach to a clinical investigation".<ref>Kushner (2000), p. 204</ref>

More sustained has been the critique of his political and ethical positions. Although many characterise Sacks as a "compassionate" writer and doctor,<ref name="weinraub">{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1044036.html|title=Oliver Sacks: Hero of the Hopeless; The Doctor of 'Awakenings,' With Compassion for the Chronically Ill|last=Weinraub|first=Judith |date=13 January 1991|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=12 August 2008}}</ref><ref name="bianculli">{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/08/25/1998-08-25_healthy_dose_of_compassion_i.html|title=Healthy Dose of Compassion in Medical 'Mind' Series|last=Bianculli|first=David|date=25 August 1998|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|accessdate=12 August 2008}}</ref><ref name="kakutani_1995">{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDB1330F937A25751C0A963958260|title=Finding the Advantages in Some Mind Disorders|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=14 February 1995|work=New York Times|accessdate=12 August 2008}}</ref> others feel that he exploits his subjects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://66.102.1.104/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=cache:RiuhVitdqOoJ:cms.mit.edu/research/theses/Kestrell2006.pdf+%22the+man+who+mistook+his+patients+for+a+literary+career%22|title=Decloaking Disability: Images of Disability and Technology in Science Fiction Media|author=Verlager, Alicia|month=August|year=2006|format=Master's thesis|publisher=MIT.edu|accessdate=10 August 2008|quote=However, Sacks' use of his preoccupation with people with disabilities as the foundation for his professional career has led many disability advocates to compare him to P.

Note also the science fiction aspect to the title of Sacks' book, which frames the disabled people he writes about as 'aliens' from a different planet. One issue in the dynamic of the expert who appoints himself as the official storyteller of the experience of disability is that both the professional and financial success of the storyteller often rely upon his framing of the disabled characters as extraordinary, freakish, or abnormal. This is what disability studies scholars and disability advocates term the 'medicalization of disability' (Linton 1998, 1–2).}}</ref> Sacks was called "the man who mistook his patients for a literary career" by British academic and disability-rights activist [[Tom Shakespeare]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shakespeare|first=Tom|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=14027836&site=ehost-live|journal=Disability and Society|volume=11|issue=1|pages=137–142|title=Book Review: ''An Anthropologist on Mars''|year=1996|accessdate=11 August 2008|doi=10.1080/09687599650023380}}</ref> and one critic called his work "a high-brow freak show".<ref name=Couser>{{cite web|url=http://poynter.indiana.edu/files/4213/4513/2230/m-couser.pdf|format=PDF|author=Couser, G.
