However, the difference between the word "fog" and the word "fag" is not trivial.

==Psychopathology==
Neurologists conceptualize clouding of consciousness in terms of a part of the brain regulating the "overall level" of the consciousness part of the brain responsible for awareness of oneself and of the environment.<ref name="Plum5"/><ref name="Grassi20">{{cite book |author=Augusto Caraceni & Luigi Grassi|title=Delirium: Acute Confusional States in Palliative Medicine |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |pages=19–21 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qiUfHyoC_zUC&lpg=PA19&ots=gGOLVsbf6s&dq=%22level%20of%20consciousness%20and%20the%20content%20of%20consciousness%22&pg=PA19#v=onepage&q=%22level%20of%20consciousness%20and%20the%20content%20of%20consciousness%22&f=false}}</ref> Various etiologies disturb this regulating part of the brain, which in turn disturbs the "overall level" of consciousness.<ref name="Stuart477">{{cite book |author=Yudofsky & Hales |title=The American Psychiatric Publishing textbook of neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurosciences |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |year=2008 |pages=477 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f5BEk-6yO_4C&lpg=PA477&ots=_vKvTikAlN&dq=%22funnel%20into%20a%20final%20common%20neural%20pathway%22&pg=PA477#v=onepage&q=%22funnel%20into%20a%20final%20common%20neural%20pathway%22&f=false}}</ref> This system of a sort of general activation of consciousness is referred to as "arousal" or "wakefulness".<ref name="Grassi20"/> 

The term "wakefulness" apparently has two contradictory definitions. On one hand, it is said that wakefulness is the degree of sensory stimulation required to keep the patient awake and vigilant.<ref name="Grassi20"/> On the other hand, it is said that it is possible for sufferers to be "awake" yet to still have a clouded consciousness.<ref name="Plum8">{{cite book |title=Plum and Posner's diagnosis of stupor and coma |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |pages=8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Otivdh2ZoVwC&lpg=PA6&dq=%22clouding%20of%20consciousness%22&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q=awakened%20clouded&f=false}}</ref> Paradoxically, sufferers declare that they are "awake but, in another way, not".<ref name="Duppils">{{cite journal |author=G Sorensen Duppils and K Wikblad|journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing |volume=16|issue=5|title=Patients’ experiences of being delirious|year=2007|month=May|pages=817 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01806.x|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17462032}}</ref> Lipowski explains that "wakefulness" as used here with clouding of consciousness does not mean "sleepiness" as is commonly thought of in common parlance. One is a stage on the way to coma, the other on the way to sleep which is very different. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Lipowski ZJ.|journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=145 |issue=3 |title=Delirium, clouding of consciousness and confusion|year=1967|pages=227–255}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Organic Psychiatry: The Psychological Consequences of Cerebral Disorder|author=William Alwyn Lishman |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=1998 |pages=4 }}</ref>

The sufferer experiences a subjective sensation of mental clouding described in the patient's own words as feeling "foggy".<ref name="Grassi82"/> One sufferer described it as "I thought it became like misty, in some way... the outlines were sort of fuzzy".<ref name="Duppils"/> 

Sufferers compare their overall experience to that of a dream because like in a dream consciousness, attention, orientation to time and place, perceptions, and awareness are disturbed.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Remembering delirium | author = Simon Fleminger | journal= The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume= 180 | pages= 4–5 | year= 2002 |url= http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/180/1/4.short}}</ref> Barbara Schildkrout, MD, a board-certified psychiatrist and clinical instructor in psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School described her subjective experience of clouding of consciousness, or what she also called "mental fog", after taking a single dose of the antihistamine chlorpheniramine for her cottonwood allergy while on a cross-country road trip. She described feeling "out of it" and being in a "dreamy state". She described a sense of not trusting her own judgment and a dulled awareness, not knowing how long time went by.<ref name="Schildkrout"/> Clouding of consciousness is not the same thing as ''depersonalization'' even though both sufferers compare their experience to that of a dream. Psychometric tests produce little evidence of a relationship between clouding of consciousness and depersonalization.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Theories of Depersonalization: A Re-appraisal | author = G. Sedman | journal= The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume= 117 | pages= 1–14 | year= 1970 |url= http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/117/536/1}}</ref>  

This may affect performance on virtually any cognitive task.<ref name="Schildkrout"/> As one author put it, "It should be apparent that cognition is not possible without a reasonable degree of arousal."<ref name="Plum5"/> The most significant, however, are inattention, thought process abnormalities, comprehension abnormalities, and language abnormalities.<ref name="Meagher"/> Sufferers may complain of being “confused”, “unable to think straight”, or “unable to get it together”.<ref>{{cite book |author=John Noble, Harry L. Greene|title=Textbook of Primary Care Medicine|publisher=Mosby|year=1996|pages=1325}}</ref>
