'''Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA)''', also called '''hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV''' — is an extremely [[rare disease|rare]] [[inherited disorder]] of the [[nervous system]] which prevents the sensation of [[pain]], heat, cold, or ''any'' real nerve-related sensations (including feeling the need to urinate); however, patients can still feel pressure. CIPA is the fourth type of [[hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy]] (HSAN), known as HSAN IV. (It is also referred to as HSAN Type IV). A person with CIPA cannot feel pain or differentiate even extreme [[temperature]]s. "[[Anhidrosis]]" means the body does not [[sweat]], and "[[congenital]]" means that the condition is present from birth.

==Clinical description==
[[File:HSANIV (CIPA).jpg|thumb|Charcot joints are demonstrated in this boy with HSAN IV or congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA). The right knee and right ankle (on the left of the picture) are enlarged and distorted. The skin over the medial aspect of the ankle is darkened with a draining wound secondary to superimposed osteomyelitis. There are other areas of trauma and ulcers including a site on the right heel.]]
Patients with this disorder are very likely to injure themselves in ways that would normally be prevented by feeling pain. The main features of the disorder are lack of pain sensation, painless injuries of the arms, legs and oral structures, [[hyperthermia]] during hot weather because of inability to sweat, syndromic [[mental retardation]] as a result of hyperthermia, [[infection]] and [[scar]]ring of the tongue, lips and gums, chronic infections of bones and joints, [[bone fracture]]s, multiple scars, [[osteomyelitis]] and joint deformities, which may lead to amputation. Other common problems are eye related, such as infection due to the sufferers rubbing them too hard, too frequently or scratching them during sleep.  In addition, patients typically lack [[myelin|unmyelinated]] and small myelinated nerve fibers in the [[dorsal root ganglion]].  Both are responsible for transmitting pain signals.  In addition, patients' sweat glands are normal in both structure and function, though they lack innervations by small diameter neurons.<ref name=Hafez1234>{{cite journal|last=Abdel-Hafez|first=Hisham|coauthors=Sarah Mohamed Awad|title=Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis (CIPA)|journal=Egyptian Dermatology Online Journal|year=2007|month=June|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://www.edoj.org/eg/vol003/00301/05/01.htm|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==
Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis may be misdiagnosed for [[leprosy]], based on similar symptoms of severe injuries to the hands and feet.

==Cause==
CIPA is caused by a genetic mutation which prevents the formation of nerve cells which are responsible for transmitting signals of pain, heat, and cold to the brain.  The disorder is autosomal recessive.  It does not appear to have any particular ethnic distribution, though it is more prevalent in cultures in which intermarriage is an accepted practice.<ref name=Mardy1234>{{cite journal|last=Mardy|first=Sek|coauthors=Yuichi Miura, Fumio Endo, Ichiro Matsuda, Yasuhiro Indo|title=Congenital Insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA):  effect of TRKA (NTRK1) missense mutations on autophosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase for nerve growth factor|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|year=2001|volume=10|issue=3|pages=179–188|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/3/179.short|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> Overheating kills more than half of all children with CIPA before age 3.

The genetic mutation is in the gene encoding the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor ([[NTRK1 gene]]).<ref name="pmid10861667">{{cite journal |author=Shatzky S, Moses S, Levy J, ''et al.'' |title=Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) in Israeli-Bedouins: genetic heterogeneity, novel mutations in the TRKA/NGF receptor gene, clinical findings, and results of nerve conduction studies |journal=Am.

==In the media==
The manga and anime series ''[[Loveless]]'' features 4 characters, the Zero, with this condition. Notably they were genetically engineered to possess it as their creator believed being unable to feel pain would make them better warriors.

In the third season of the TV series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' in the episode "[[Insensitive (House)|Insensitive]]" (14th episode), the patient (Hannah Morganthal, played by [[Mika Boorem]]) suffers from this condition.

In the third season of the TV series ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' in the episode "[[Sometimes a Fantasy (Grey's Anatomy)|Sometimes a Fantasy]]", [[Abigail Breslin]]'s character, Megan Clover, is diagnosed with this condition.

In the seventh season of the TV series ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' in the episode "[[Painless (Criminal Minds)|Painless]]"(4th episode), the unknown subject of the episode suffers from the condition.

Baby Carson was featured on [[Discovery Health Channel]]'s ''[[Mystery Diagnosis]]'' episode "The Boy Who Never Cried", which aired on 21 November 2009. Dr. David Christopher of Valley Children's Clinic, [[Renton, Washington]] is his doctor.

In [[Stieg Larsson]]'s novel ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire]]'', one of the villains, known through most of the book as the "blonde giant", suffers from the disorder.

In the 2010 film [[Bereavement (film)|Bereavement]], 6 year old Martin Bristol, one of the main characters, suffers from CIPA.

In the BBC1 hospital drama [[Holby City]], in the episode entitled "Wolf's Clothing", first broadcast on 15 May 2012, a teenage girl called Kitty is found to have CIPA, which is responsible for her heart condition having been undiagnosed.

In the [[Show TV]] drama [[Sleepers (TV series 2012)|Sleepers]], one of the main characters, Gazanfer Bircan, had CIPA when he was a child. Symptoms of the disease continue when he is 30 years old. Because of CIPA, he harms and injures people around him.

In the book ''[[Steven James#The Rook (Synopsis)|The Rook]]'' by [[Steven James]], the character Creighton Malice suffers from this condition.
