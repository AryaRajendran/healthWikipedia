'''Miosis''' (or '''myosis''', from [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[wiktionary:μύειν|μύειν]]'', ''mūein'', "to close the eyes") is a term with various definitions, which generally include [[constriction]] of the [[pupil]].

The opposite condition, [[mydriasis]], is the dilation of the pupil. [[Anisocoria]] is the condition of one pupil being more dilated than the other.

==Definitions==
Definitions of miosis include:
* Constriction of the pupil that is excessive,<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/miosis Farlex medical dictionary] citing:
* Miller-Keane Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, and Allied Health, Seventh Edition.
* Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed.</ref> which may potentially be interpreted as being relative to what would be expected by the amount of light the pupil receives
* Constriction of the pupil to a diameter of less than two millimeters<ref>{{Cite book

==Physiology of the photomotor reflex==
Light entering the eye strikes three different [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s in the [[retina]]: the familiar [[Rod cell|rods]] and [[Cone cell|cones]] used in image forming and the more newly discovered [[photosensitive ganglion cell]]s.  The ganglion cells give information about ambient light levels, and react sluggishly compared to the rods and cones.  Signals from ganglion cells have three functions: acute suppression of the hormone [[melatonin]], [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the body's [[circadian rhythm]]s and regulation of the size of the pupil.

The retinal photoceptors convert light stimuli into electric impulses.  Nerves involved in the resizing of the pupil connect to the [[Pretectum|pretectal nucleus]] of the high [[Mesencephalon|midbrain]], bypassing the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] and the primary [[visual cortex]]. From the pretectal nucleus neurons send axons to neurons of the [[Edinger-Westphal nucleus]] whose [[Motor neuron|visceromotor]] axons run along both the left and right [[oculomotor nerve]]s. Visceromotor nerve axons (which constitute a portion of [[cranial nerve]] III, along with the somatomotor portion derived from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus) synapse on [[ciliary ganglion]] neurons, whose parasympathetic axons innervate the [[iris sphincter muscle]], producing '''miosis'''.  This occurs because sympathetic activity from the ciliary ganglion is ''lost'' thus parasympathetics are not inhibited.

* [[Horner's syndrome]]
* [[Hemorrhage]] into [[pons]] ([[intracranial hemorrhage]])
* [[Cluster Headaches]] with [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]
* [[Iridocyclitis]]
* [[Fatal familial insomnia]]

=== Drugs ===
* [[Opioid]]s such as [[fentanyl]], [[morphine]], [[heroin]] and [[methadone]] (the notable exception being [[demerol|demerol/pethidine]])
* [[Antipsychotics]], including [[haloperidol]], [[thorazine]], [[olanzapine]], [[quetiapine]] and others
* [[Cholinergic]] agents such as [[acetylcholine]]
* Some cancer [[chemotherapy]] drugs, including [[camptothecin]] derivatives

* [[Trazodone]]
* Some [[MAO inhibitor|MAO Inhibitors]].
* In some rare cases, when exposed to [[mustard gas]].
* [[Organophosphates]]

===Miotics===
A '''miotic''' substance causes the constriction of the [[pupil]] of the eye (or miosis). It is the opposite of a [[mydriatic]] substance, which causes dilation of the pupil.
