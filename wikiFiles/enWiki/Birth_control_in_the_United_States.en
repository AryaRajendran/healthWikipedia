[[Birth control]] in the [[United States]]

===Birth control before 20th century===
{{see also|Womb veil}}

The practice of birth control was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914, when the movement to legalize contraception began. Longstanding techniques included the [[rhythm method]], [[Coitus interruptus|withdrawal]], [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]], [[contraceptive sponge]]s, [[condom]]s, [[Lactational amenorrhea method|prolonged breastfeeding]], and [[spermicides]].<ref>Engelman, pp. 3–4.</ref> Use of [[contraceptive]]s increased throughout the nineteenth century, contributing to a 50 percent drop in the [[Total fertility rate|fertility rate]] in the United States between 1800 and 1900, particularly in urban regions.<ref>Engelman, p. 5. Fertility rate dropped from 7 to 3½ children per couple.</ref> The only known survey conducted during the nineteenth century of American women's contraceptive habits was performed by [[Clelia Mosher]] from 1892 to 1912.<ref>Engelman, p. 11.</ref> The survey was based on a small sample of upper-class women, and shows that most of the women used contraception (primarily douching, but also withdrawal, rhythm, condoms and [[pessaries]]) and that they viewed sex as a pleasurable act that could be undertaken without the goal of procreation.<ref>Tone, pp. 73–75.<br/>Engelman, pp. 11–12.</ref>
[[File:Robertdaleowenindiana.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of a well dressed man, around 50 years old, circa 1850.|upright|[[Robert Dale Owen]] wrote the first book on birth control published in the U.S.]]
Although contraceptives were relatively common in middle-class and upper-class society, the topic was rarely discussed in public.<ref>Engelman, pp. 5–6. Rarely in public: Engelman cites Brodie, Janet, ''Contraception and Abortion in 19th Century America'', Cornell University Press, 1987.</ref> The first book published in the United States which ventured to discuss contraception was ''Moral Physiology; or, A Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question'', published by [[Robert Dale Owen]] in 1831.<ref>Engelman, p. 6.<br/>Cullen DuPont, Kathryn (2000), "Contraception" in ''Encyclopedia of women's history in America'', Infobase Publishing, p. 53 (first book in America).<br/>Year of publication is variously stated as 1830 or 1831.</ref> The book suggested that [[family planning]] was a laudable effort, and that sexual gratification&nbsp;– without the goal of reproduction&nbsp;– was not immoral.<ref>Engelman, p. 6.</ref> Owen recommended withdrawal, but he also discussed sponges and condoms.<ref>Engelman, pp. 6–7.</ref> That book was followed by ''Fruits of Philosophy: The Private Companion of Young Married People'', written in 1832 by [[Charles Knowlton]], which recommended [[douching]].<ref>Riddle, John M. (1999), ''Eve's Herbs: A History of Contraception and Abortion in the West'', Harvard University Press, pp. 226–7.</ref> Knowlton was prosecuted in Massachusetts on [[obscenity]] charges, and served three months in prison.<ref>Engelman, p. 7.</ref>

Birth control practices were generally adopted earlier in Europe than in the United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by [[Charles Bradlaugh]] and [[Annie Besant]], with the goal of challenging Britain's obscenity laws.<ref>Engelman, pp. 7–8.</ref> They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the [[Malthusian League]]&nbsp;– the world's first birth control advocacy group&nbsp;–&#32;which sought to limit population growth to avoid [[Thomas Malthus]]' dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine.<ref>Engelman, pp. 8–9.</ref> By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and birth control began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France.<ref>"Contraception", in ''Women's studies encyclopedia, Volume 1'', Helen Tierney (Ed.), Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, p. 301.</ref> As the birth control societies spread across Europe, so did birth control clinics. The first birth control clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherland's first female physician, [[Aletta Jacobs]].<ref>Engelman, pp. 9, 47.</ref> The first birth control clinic in England was established in 1921 by [[Marie Stopes]], in London.<ref>Ahluwalia, Sanjam (2008), ''Reproductive Restraints: Birth Control in India, 1877–1947'', University of Illinois Press, p. 54.</ref>

===Contraception outlawed===
{{main|Comstock laws}}
[[File:Anthony Comstock.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A portrait of a man, about 60 years old, with bushy sideburns.|[[Anthony Comstock]] was responsible for many anti-contraception laws in the U.S.]]
Contraception was legal in the United States throughout most of the 19th century, but in the 1870s a [[social purity movement]] grew in strength, aimed at outlawing [[vice]] in general, and [[prostitution]] and obscenity in particular.<ref>Tone, p. 17.<br/>Engelman, pp. 13–14.</ref> Composed primarily of Protestant moral reformers and middle-class women, the [[Victorian-era]] campaign also attacked contraception, which was viewed as an [[Victorian morality|immoral]] practice that promoted prostitution and [[venereal disease]].<ref>Engelman, pp. 13–14.</ref> [[Anthony Comstock]], a [[United States Postal Inspection Service|postal inspector]] and leader in the purity movement, successfully lobbied for the passage of the 1873 [[Comstock Act]], a federal law prohibiting mailing of "any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of [[abortion]]" as well as any form of contraceptive information.<ref>Engelman, p. 15.</ref> Many states also passed similar state laws (collectively known as the ''[[Comstock laws]]''), sometimes extending the federal law by outlawing the ''use'' of contraceptives, as well as their distribution. Comstock was proud of the fact that he was personally responsible for thousands of arrests and the destruction of hundreds of tons of books and pamphlets.<ref>Engelman, pp. 15–16.</ref>

Comstock and his allies also took aim at the libertarians and utopians who comprised the [[free love movement]]&nbsp;– an initiative to promote sexual freedom, equality for women, and abolition of marriage.<ref>Beisel, Nicola Kay (1998), ''Imperiled Innocents: Anthony Comstock and Family Reproduction in Victorian America'', Princeton University Press, pp. 76–78.</ref> The free love proponents were the only group to actively oppose the Comstock laws in the 19th century, setting the stage for the birth control movement.<ref name=E20>Engelman, p. 20.</ref>

The efforts of the free love movement were not successful and, at the beginning of the 20th century, [[Federal government|federal]] and [[state government]]s began to enforce the Comstock laws more rigorously.<ref name=E20/> In response, contraception went underground, but it was not extinguished. The number of publications on the topic dwindled, and advertisements, if they were found at all, used euphemisms such as "marital aids" or "hygienic devices". Drug stores continued to sell condoms as "rubber goods" and [[cervical cap]]s as "womb supporters".<ref>Engelman, pp. 18–19.</ref>

===Post World War II===

After World War II, the birth control movement had accomplished the goal of making birth control legal, and advocacy for reproductive rights transitioned into a new era which focused on abortion, public funding, and insurance coverage.<ref>Engelman, p 186.</ref>

Birth control advocacy also took on a global aspect as organizations around the world began to collaborate. In 1946, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] and soon became the world's largest [[NGO|non-governmental]] international family planning organization.<ref>Esser-Stuart, Joan E., "Margaret Higgins Sanger", in ''Encyclopedia of Social Welfare History in North America'', Herrick, John and Stuart, Paul (Eds), SAGE, 2005, p. 323.</ref> In 1952, [[John D.

===1960s - Sexual revolution and 'The Pill'===
{{see also|Sexual revolution|Sexual revolution in 1960s America}}

In the United States, a flurry of legal actions in the 1960s and 1970s changed the landscape of reproductive rights: in 1965, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' that it was unconstitutional for the government to prohibit married couples from using birth control.  

In 1965 millions of unmarried women in 26 states were still denied birth control.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Birth Control|url=http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org|accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref>   In 1967 Boston University students petitioned Bill Baird to challenge Massachusetts's stringent "Crimes Against Chastity, Decency, Morality and Good Order" law.<ref>{{cite news|title=William Baird makes history|newspaper=Boston University News|date=April 12, 1967}}</ref> On April 6, 1967 he gave a speech to 1,500 students and others at Boston University on abortion and birth control.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite news|title=Birth Control 'Crusader' Arrested After BU Lecture|newspaper=The Boston Herald|date=April 7, 1967}}</ref> He gave a female student one condom and a package of contraceptive foam.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Baird was arrested and convicted as a felon, facing up to ten years in jail.<ref>{{cite news|title=Crusader Baird Faces 10-year Prison Term|newspaper=Long Island Star Journal|date=September 1l, 1967}}</ref> He spent three months in Boston's Charles Street Jail.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baird Gets 3 Months For Birth Control Advice to Students|newspaper=Boston Record American|date=May 20, 1969}}</ref>   During his challenge to the Massachusetts law, the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts stated that "there is nothing to be gained by court action of this kind.

Baird]]'' legalized birth control for all Americans on March 22, 1972. ''Eisenstadt v. Baird'', a landmark right to privacy decision, became the foundation for such cases as ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and the 2003 gay rights victory ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.

In 1970, Congress finally removed references to contraception from federal anti-obscenity laws;<ref>Engelman, p. 184.</ref> and in 1973, the ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision legalized abortion during the first [[Trimester (pregnancy)#Physiology|trimester of pregnancy]].<ref name="Roe">''Roe v.

During the same time period, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] was steadily developing new modes of contraception. In the early 1950s, philanthropist [[Katharine McCormick]] provided funding for biologist [[Gregory Goodwin Pincus|Gregory Pincus]] to develop the [[birth control pill]], which was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1960.<ref>Tone, pp. 204–207.<br/>Engelman, Peter, "McCormick, Katharine Dexter", in ''Encyclopedia of Birth Control'', Vern L.
