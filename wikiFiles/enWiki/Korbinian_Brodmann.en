'''Korbinian Brodmann''' (November 17, 1868 – August 22, 1918) was a [[Germany|German]] [[neurologist]] who became famous for his definition of the [[cerebral cortex]] into 52 distinct regions from their [[cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitectonic]] ([[histological]]) characteristics, known as [[Brodmann area]]s.<ref name="Finger2001">{{cite book|author=Stanley Finger|title=Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_GMeW9E1IB4C&pg=PA42|accessdate=26 January 2013|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514694-3|pages=42–}}</ref>

==Life==
Brodmann was born in [[Hohenfels, Konstanz|Liggersdorf]], [[Province of Hohenzollern]], and studied [[medicine]] in [[Munich]], [[Würzburg]], [[Berlin]] and [[Freiburg]], where he received his medical diploma in 1895. Subsequently he studied at the Medical School in the [[University of Lausanne]] in [[Switzerland]], and then worked in the University Clinic in Munich. He got a [[doctor of medicine]] degree from the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1898, with a thesis on chronic [[ependymal]] [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]]. He worked also in the Psychiatric Clinic in the [[University of Jena]], with [[Ludwig Binswanger]], and in the Municipal Mental Asylum in [[Frankfurt]], from 1900 to 1901. There, he met [[Alois Alzheimer]], who was influential in his decision to pursue neuroscientific basic research.

Following this, Brodmann started to work in 1901 with [[Cécile Vogt-Mugnier|Cécile]] and [[Oskar Vogt]] at the private institute "Neurobiologische Zentralstation" in Berlin, and in 1902 in the Neurobiological Laboratory of the [[University of Berlin]]. In 1915 he joined the [[Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Hirnforschung]] (Institute for Brain Research).

In 1909 he published his original research on cortical cytoarchitectonics in ''"Vergleichende Lokalisationslehre der Großhirnrinde in ihren Prinzipien dargestellt auf Grund des Zellenbaues"'' (Comparative Localization Studies in the Brain Cortex, its Fundamentals Represented on the Basis of its Cellular Architecture).

In the following years he worked at the [[University of Tübingen]], where he was habilitated and made a full professor in 1913, and from 1910 to 1916 as physician and chairman of the Anatomical Laboratory at the University Psychiatric Clinic. In 1916 he moved to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in order to work in the Nietleben Municipal Hospital. Finally, in 1918, he accepted an invitation from the [[University of Munich]] to direct the group of histology at Psychiatric Research Center.

He died in Munich rather suddenly of a generalized [[septicemia|septic infection]] following [[pneumonia]], at just under 50 years of age on August 22, 1918.

[[File:Brodmann areas 3D.png|100px|thumbnail|right|Modern depictions of Brodmann areas.]]
The areas he depicted on the brain are now usually referred to as [[Brodmann area]]s. There are a total of 52 areas grouped into 11 histological areas.<ref name="ClarkeDewhurst1996">{{cite book|author1=Edwin Clarke|author2=Kenneth Dewhurst|author3=Michael Jeffrey Aminoff|title=An Illustrated History of Brain Function: Imaging the Brain from Antiquity to the Present|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yz8YRf2sQDEC&pg=PA123|accessdate=26 January 2013|year=1996|publisher=Norman Publishing|isbn=978-0-930405-65-6|pages=123–}}</ref> Brodmann used a variety of criteria to map the human brain, including attention to gross anatomical features as well as the examination of cortical micro-structures.<ref name="Philosophy of Psychology and Cognitive Science: A Volume of the Handbook of the Philosophy of Science Series">{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Psychology and Cognitive Science: A Volume of the Handbook of the Philosophy of Science Series|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Lp93PtrvM0MC&pg=PA147|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=23 October 2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-046662-0|pages=147–}}</ref>

Brodmann postulated that these areas with different structures performed different functions.<ref name="BearConnors2007">{{cite book|author1=Mark F. Bear|author2=Barry W. Connors|author3=Michael A.

* [[Brodmann area 41]] and [[Brodmann area 42|42]] in the [[temporal lobe]] related to [[hearing (sense)|hearing]]
* [[Brodmann area 45]] and [[Brodmann area 44|44]] overlap with the [[Broca's area]] for language in humans
* [[Brodmann area 1]] and [[Brodmann area 2|2]] and [[Brodmann area 3|3]] in the postcentral gyrus of the [[parietal lobe]] (the [[somatosensory system|somatosensory]] region)
* [[Brodmann area 17]] and [[Brodmann area 18|18]] in the [[occipital lobe]] (the primary [[visual system|visual]] areas).

His work on identifying areas of cytoarchitecture was strongly influenced by [[Oskar Vogt]], who postulated over 200 distinct areas in the brain.<ref name="Finger2001" />
