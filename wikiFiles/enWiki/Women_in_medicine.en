Historically and in many parts of the world, '''women's participation in the profession of medicine''' (as [[physician]]s, for instance) has been significantly restricted, although women's ''practice'' of medicine, informally, in the role of caregivers, or in the [[allied health professions]], has been widespread.  Most countries of the world now guarantee equal access by women to [[medical education]], although not all ensure equal employment opportunities<ref>See generally, "Women's Human Rights", 1998, [[Human Rights Watch]] (available [http://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/women/women3.html online]).</ref> and gender parity has yet to be achieved within the medical specialties and around the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Women's participation in the medical professions was limited by law and practice during the decades while medicine was [[professionalization|professionalizing]].<ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches">See generally [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] & [[Deirdre English]], ''Witches, Midwives, and Nurses'' (1973).</ref> However, women kept practicing medicine in the [[allied health]] fields ([[nursing]], [[midwifery]], etc.), and throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, women made significant gains in access to [[medical education]] and medical work through much of the world. These gains were sometimes tempered by setbacks; for instance, [[Mary Roth Walsh]] documented a ''decline'' in women physicians in the US in the first half of the twentieth century, such that there were fewer women physicians in 1950 than there were in 1900.<ref name="Walsh-1977">Walsh, 1977.</ref>  However, through the latter half of the twentieth century, women had gains generally across the board. In the United States, for instance, women were 9% of total US medical school enrollment in 1969; this had increased to 20% in 1976.<ref name="Walsh-1977" />  By 1985, women comprised 14% of practicing US physicians.<ref name="Morantz-Sanchez-2001-preface">Morantz-Sanchez, Preface.</ref>

At the beginning of the twenty-first century in industrialized nations, women have made significant gains, but have yet to achieve parity throughout the medical profession.  Women have achieved parity in medical school in some industrialized countries, since 2003 forming the majority of the United States medical student body.<ref>[http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/pressrel/2003/031104.htm "Applicants to U.S. Medical Schools Increase; Women the Majority for the First Time"],  [[Association of American Medical Colleges]], Nov. 3, 2003, press release ("Women made up the majority of medical school applicants for the first time ever").</ref> In 2007-2008, women accounted for 49% of medical school applicants and 48.3% of those accepted.<ref>[http://www.aamc.org/data/facts/charts1982to2007.pdf ]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> According to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) 48.3% (16,838) of medical degrees awarded in the US in 2009-10 were earned by women, an increase from 26.8% in 1982-3.<ref>[https://www.aamc.org/download/153708/data/charts1982to2011.pdf ]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref>

However, the practice of medicine remains disproportionately male overall. In industrialized nations, the recent parity in gender of medical students has not yet trickled into parity in practice. In many developing nations, neither medical school nor practice approach gender parity.

Moreover, there are skews within the medical profession: some medical specialties, such as surgery, are significantly male-dominated,<ref>Dixie Mills, "Women in Surgery - Past, Present, and Future" (2003 presentation, [[Association of Women Surgeons]]; available at [http://www.womensurgeons.org/about/items/womeninsurgery2003c.ppt AWS website].</ref> while other specialties are significantly female-dominated, or are becoming so. In the United States, female physicians outnumber male physicians in pediatrics and female residents outnumber male residents in family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and psychiatry.<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16229.html AMA (WPC) Table 16 - Physician Specialties by Gender- 2006<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12915.html AMA (WPC) Table 4 - Women Residents by Specialty - 2005<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Women continue to dominate in nursing. In 2000, 94.6% of registered nurses in the United States were women.<ref>[http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/reports/rnsurvey/rnss1.htm RNSS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Biomedical research and academic medical professions—i.e., faculty at medical schools—are also disproportionately male. Research on this issue, called the "leaky pipeline" by the [[National Institutes of Health]] and other researchers, shows that while women have achieved parity with men in entering graduate school, a variety of discrimination causes them to drop out at each stage in the academic pipeline: graduate school, [[postdoc]], faculty positions, achieving tenure; and, ultimately, in receiving recognition for groundbreaking work.<ref>The term was coined by S.E.

===Ancient medicine===
The involvement of women in the field of [[medicine]] has been recorded in several early civilizations. An [[Egypt]]ian, [[Merit Ptah]] (2700 BC), described in an inscription as "chief physician", is the earliest woman named in the [[history of science]]. [[Agamede]] was cited by [[Homer]] as a healer in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] before the [[Trojan War]]. [[Agnodike]] was the first female [[physician]] to practice legally in 4th century BC [[Athens]].  [[Metrodora]] was a physician and generally regarded as the first [[medical writer]].

===Medieval Europe===
During the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], [[convent]]s were an important place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly [[research]]. An example is the [[Germany|German]] [[abbess]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]], whose prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including [[medicine]], [[botany]] and [[natural history]] (c.1151-58).<ref>[http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html Hildegard von Bingen (Sabina Flanagan)]</ref> She is considered Germany's first female [[physician]].<ref name=hildegard>{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Hildegard von Bingen | encyclopedia = Key Figures in Medieval Europe - An Encyclopedia | editor = Richard K.

The 11th century saw the emergence of the [[medieval university|first universities]]. Women were, for the most part, excluded from [[university]] education.<ref>[Whaley, Leigh Ann. Women's History as Scientists. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, INC, 2003.]</ref> However, there were some exceptions. The Italian [[University of Bologna]], for example, allowed women to attend lectures from its inception, in 1088.<ref name=wise>{{cite journal| author= JS Edwards |title= A Woman Is Wise: The Influence of Civic and Christian Humanism on the Education of Women in Northern Italy and England during the Renaissance |journal=Ex Post Facto: Journal of the History Students at San Francisco State University |volume =XI | year=2002 |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~epf/2002/edwards.html}}</ref>

Within the [[Caliphate|Islamic empire]], between the 800s and 1300s, women generally treated other women, and were trained privately. Practitioners were well respected, with support from government, and many kept their fees low so that any good student could join them.

The attitude to educating women in medical fields in [[Italy]] appears to have been more liberal than in other places. The physician, [[Trotula of Salerno|Trotula di Ruggiero]], is supposed to have held a chair at the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|Medical School of Salerno]] in the 11th century, where she taught many noble Italian women, a group sometimes referred to as the "ladies of Salerno".<ref name="reframing">[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu37we/uu37we08.htm Feminist approaches to technology: Reframing the question]</ref> Several influential texts on women's medicine, dealing with [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]], among other topics, are also often attributed to Trotula.

[[Dorotea Bucca]] was another distinguished Italian physician. She held a chair of philosophy and medicine at the University of Bologna for over forty years from 1390.<ref name=wise/><ref name="Howard">[http://books.google.com/books?id=RoqNOWuNa8oC&pg=PA35&dq=%22dorotea+bucca%22&sig=8woi3s53ZMsEXfRjee9uswZdUHI Howard S.

===Western medicine in China===
[[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] that is based on the use of herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage and other forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years.  However, Western Medicine was introduced to China in the 19th Century, mainly by medical missionaries sent from various Christian mission organizations, such as the [[London Missionary Society]] (Britain), the [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church (Britain) and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian Church (USA)]]. [[Benjamin Hobson]] (1816-1873), a medical missionary sent by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1839, set up a highly successful Wai Ai Clinic (惠愛醫館) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ifeng.com/article/46027.html |title=回眸：当年传教士进羊城_MW悦读室之岭南话廊_凤凰博报- 博采众家之言 报闻公民心声-凤凰网 |publisher=Blog.ifeng.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/GDSI199901009.htm |title=合信的《全体新论》与广东士林-《广东史志》1999年01期-中国知网 |publisher=Mall.cnki.net |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref> in Guangzhou, China. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] (香港華人西醫書院) was founded in 1887 by the [[London Missionary Society]], with its first graduate (in 1892) being [[Sun Yat-sen]] (孫中山).  Sun later led the 1911 Xinhai Revolution ([[Chinese Revolution (1911)]]), which changed China from an empire to a republic. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the [[University of Hong Kong]], which started in 1911.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male doctors of Western Medicine.  This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors of Western Medicine in China.  Thus, female medical missionary [[Mary Hannah Fulton|Dr. Mary H. Fulton]] (1854-1927) <ref>{{cite web|author=Inasmuch |url=http://www.amazon.com/Inasmuch-Mary-H-Fulton/dp/1140341804 |title=Inasmuch (9781140341802): Mary H.

Most students became Christians, due to the influence of Dr. Fulton. The College was officially recognized, with its diplomas marked with the official stamp of the Guangdong provincial government.  The College was aimed at the spreading of Christianity and modern medicine and the elevation of Chinese women's social status.

She also pledged that she would not convert to Christianity. Her speech received publicity, and financial contributions started coming in from all over India. The then Viceroy of India contributed 200 rupees to a fund for her education.She graduated with an M.D. on March 11, 1886, the topic of her thesis having been "Obstetrics among the Aryan Hindoos".

===Women's health movement in the seventies===
The seventies marked a great increase of women entering and graduating from [[medical school]]. From 1930 to 1970, a period of 40 years, about 14,000 women graduated from medical school. From 1970 to 1980, a period of 10 years, over 20,000 women graduated from medical school.<ref>Paludi, Michele A. and Gertrude A. Streuernage, ed., Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines (New York: Harrington Park Press, 1990), 236.</ref> This increase of women in the medical field was due to both political and cultural changes.

Two laws in the United States lifted restrictions for women in the medical field -- [[Title IX]] of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1972 and the [[Public Health Service Act]] of 1975, banning discrimination on grounds of gender. In November 1970, the Assembly of the Association of American Medical Colleges rallied for equal rights in the medical field.<ref>Paludi and Streuernage, Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines, 236.</ref>

At the same time, women's ideas about themselves and their relation to the medical field were shifting due to the [[women's movement]].  [[Betty Friedan]]’s book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' (1963) critiqued much of the sexual ideology of the 1950s, including [[Freudian theory]].  "The crisis in woman’s identity," Friedan says, was that women only planned for part of their life, to marry and have children.  "They slid easily into their sexual role as women before they knew who they were themselves."<ref>Friedan, Betty. The Feminine Mystique. (New York: Norton, 2001), 123, 127, 133.</ref>

This increase of women in the medical field lead to developments in doctor patient relationships, changes in terminology and theory. One area of medical practice that was challenged and changed was [[gynecology]]. Wendy Kline in her book Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave<ref>Kline, Wendy. Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave (University of Chicago Press, 2010).</ref> talks about the blurring of “clinical” and “sexual” that occurred in the medical field in the late 40s into the 60s, particularly in gynecology. Kline says that “to ensure that young brides were ready for the wedding night, they [doctors] used the [[pelvic exam]] as a form of sex instruction .”<ref>Kline, Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave, 4.</ref> In Ellen Frankfort’s book Vaginal Politics, Frankfort talks about the “shame” and “humiliation” felt during a pap test; “I was naked, he was dressed; I was lying down, he was standing up; I was quiet, he was giving orders ”<ref>Frankfort, Ellen. Vaginal Politics. (New York: Vintage, 1970)</ref>

With a higher numbers of women enrolled in medical school medical practices, like gynecology were challenged and changed.  As one medical student is quoted in Kline’s book as saying, “Since I experienced my own exams as a humiliating procedure, I feared inflicting the same humiliation on another person. ”<ref>Kline, Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave.</ref>  In 1972 at the University of Iowa Medical School, was one school that instituted a new training program for pelvic and breast examinations. Students would act both as the doctor and the patient, allowing each student to understand the procedure, and create a more gentle, respectful, examination. This method was much different than the previous practice in which doctors were taught to assert their power over patients. With changes in ideologies and practices, throughout the 70s, by 1980 over 75 schools had adopted this new method.<ref>Paludi and Streuernage, Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines, 241.</ref>

With women entering the medical field and women’s rights movements came also the women’s health movement which sought alternative methods of health care for women. This came through the creation of self-help books, most notably [[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]: A Book by and for Women.<ref>Boston Women’s Health Book Collective Staff, Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women (Boston: Simon and Schuster Trade, 1976).</ref> This book gave women a “manual” to help understand their body. It challenged hospital treatment, and doctor’s practices. Aside from self-help books, many help centres were opened: birth centres run by [[midwives]], safe-[[abortion]] centres, and classes for educating women on their bodies; all with the aim of providing non-judgmental, warm, and comfortable care for women.<ref>Schulman, Bruce J. The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and politics. (Da Capo Press, 2002), 174.</ref> Kline speaks to this claim women were taking on their body in relation to the medical world; women felt that “not only should women have access to information about their bodies... they should also help to create this knowledge. ”<ref>Kline, Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave, 3.</ref> The women’s health movement, along with women involved in the medical field opened the doors for research and awareness for female illness like [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].

While scholars in the history of medicine had developed some study of women in the field—biographies of pioneering women physicians were common prior to the 1960s—the study of women in medicine took particular root with the advent of the [[women's movement]] in the 1960s, and in conjunction with the [[women's health movement]].  Two publications in 1973 were critical in establishing the women's health movement and scholarship about women in medicine: First, the publication of ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' in 1973 by the Boston Women's Health Collective,<ref>''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' (1973).</ref> and second, "Witches, Midwives, and Nurses: A History of Female Healers", a short paper by [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Deirdre English]] also in 1973.<ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches" /> The Ehrenreich/English paper examined the history of women in medicine as the professionalization of the field excluded women, particularly [[midwifery|midwives]], from the practice.  Ehrenreich and English later expanded the work into a full-length book, ''[[For Her Own Good]]'', which connected the exclusion of women from the practice of medicine to [[sexism|sexist]] medical practices; this text and ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' became key texts in the women's health movement. The English/Ehrenreich text laid out some early insights about the professionalization of medicine and the exclusion of women from the profession, and numerous scholars, such as [[Diana Elizabeth Long]], have greatly built upon and expanded this work.
