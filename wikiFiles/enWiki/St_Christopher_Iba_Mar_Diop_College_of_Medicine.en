'''St Christopher Iba Mar Diop College of Medicine''' is a medical training establishment in [[Luton]], [[England]]. The medical college is listed<ref>[https://imed.faimer.org/details.asp?country=&school=Iba+Mar+Diop&currpage=1&cname=&city=&region=&rname=&mcode=820020&psize=25 School listing] in [[IMED]]</ref>  in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED) as a college within the University El Hadji Ibrahima Niasse of [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]. According to the IMED listing, the college was formerly named St. Christopher's College of Medicine, and diplomas prior to 2006 were awarded under that name rather than by the university. The Luton, England campus was closed in 2011. Degrees from this establishment have been listed as unacceptable by the [[General Medical Council]] in the United Kingdom and some state governments in the United States.
