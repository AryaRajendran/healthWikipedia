}}</ref>The term ''orthorexia'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ορθο- (''ortho'', "right" or "correct"), and όρεξις (''orexis'', "appetite"), literally meaning a ''correct diet''. It was introduced in 1997 by [[Doctor of Medicine]] Steven Bratman, to be used as a parallel with other [[eating disorder]]s, such as [[anorexia nervosa]]. Orthorexia is not mentioned in the widely-used [[Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders|DSM]]{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}, but was coined by Bratman<ref>http://udini.proquest.com/view/in-sickness-and-in-health-pqid:2428837551/ In Sickness and In Health: Orthorexia Nervosa, the Study of Obsessive Healthy Eating</ref> who claims that in rare cases, this focus may turn into a fixation so extreme that it can lead to severe [[malnutrition]] or even death.<ref name="beyondveg">{{cite web

This differs from other [[eating disorder]]s, such as ''anorexia nervosa'' and ''bulimia nervosa'', whereby people "focus on quantity of food".<ref name="Healthy food obsession sparks rise in new eating disorder"/>

== History ==
Steven Bratman coined the term "orthorexia nervosa" in 1997 from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''orthos'', meaning "correct or right", and ''orexis'', meaning "appetite".<ref>S. Bratman, D. Knight: ''Health food junkies''. Broadway Books, New York, 2000.</ref> Literally "correct appetite", the word is modeled on ''anorexia'', meaning "without appetite", as used in definition of the condition [[anorexia nervosa]]. Bratman describes ''orthorexia'' as an unhealthy [[fixation (psychology)|fixation]] with what the individual considers to be [[healthy eating]]. The subject may avoid certain unhealthy foods, such as those containing [[fat]]s,  [[preservative]]s, man-made food-additives, [[animal product]]s, or other ingredients considered by the subject to be unhealthy; if the sufferer does not eat appropriately, malnutrition can ensue.  Bratman claims Orthorexic sufferers have specific preferences about the foods they are eating and avoiding. Products that are preserved with additives can be considered dangerous. Industrial products can be seen as artificial, whereas fruits and vegetables can be seen as healthy.<ref name="Getz">{{cite web

}}</ref> Bratman asserts that "[[emaciation]] is common among followers of certain health food diets, such as [[rawfoodism]], and this can at times reach the extremes seen in anorexia nervosa."  In addition, he claims that "anorexic orthorexia" can be as dangerous as anorexia. However, he states, "the underlying motivation is quite different. While an anorexic wants to lose weight, an orthorexic does not desire to become thin<ref name="Getz"/> but wants to feel pure, healthy and natural. Eating disorder specialists may fail to understand this distinction, leading to a disconnect between orthorexic and physician."<ref name="beyondveg"/><ref>[http://www.pamf.org/teen/life/bodyimage/orthorexia.html Palo Alto Medical Foundation Summary of Eating Disorders]</ref>

According to the ''Macmillan English Dictionary,'' the word is entering the [[English language|English]] [[lexicon]].<ref>[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/040103-orthorexia.htm Macmillan English Dictionary entry for ''Orthorexia Nervosa'']</ref>

==Diagnostic criteria==
Although Orthorexia is not recognized as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association, and it is not listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]]<ref>[http://www.bulimiaguide.org/summary/detail.aspx?doc_id=9380 Orthorexia nervosa<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> or planned to be included in the [[DSM-5]] to be published May 2013,<ref>Rochman, B.

As of January 2007, only two peer-reviewed studies have been published on the alleged condition.<ref name="Donini 2004">{{cite journal |author=Donini L, Marsili D, Graziani M, Imbriale M, Cannella C |title=Orthorexia nervosa: a preliminary study with a proposal for diagnosis and an attempt to measure the dimension of the phenomenon |journal=Eat Weight Disord |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=151–157 |year=2004 |pmid=15330084}}</ref><ref name="Donini 2005">{{cite journal |author=Donini L, Marsili D, Graziani M, Imbriale M, Cannella C |title=Orthorexia nervosa: validation of a diagnosis questionnaire |journal=Eat Weight Disord |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=e28–32 |year=2005 |pmid=16682853}}</ref>  In the studies, Donini et al. define orthorexia nervosa as a "maniacal obsession for healthy foods" and propose several diagnostic criteria.<ref name="Donini 2004"/>  Sufferers of orthorexia often display symptoms consistent with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and have an exaggerated concern with healthy eating patterns. Like anorexia, however, these obsessive compulsive symptoms may be an effect of starvation rather than a cause of the disorder.<ref>Carlson, N: ''Physiology of Behavior, 10th ed.'', page 435. Person Education Inc., 2010</ref>  A diagnostic questionnaire has been developed for orthorexia sufferers, similar to questionnaires for other eating disorders.<ref name="Donini 2005"/>  Bratman proposes an initial self-test composed of two direct questions:  "Do you care more about the virtue of what you eat than the pleasure you receive from eating it?... Does your diet socially isolate you?"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4389849.stm |title='I am an orthorexic'|last=McCandless |first= David  |date=29 March 2005| publisher=BBC News}}</ref>  Other questions concerning those who may be suffering from orthorexia provided by Davis on the WebMD (2000) website are: Do they spend more than 3 hours a day thinking about healthy foods? When they eat the way they're supposed to, do they feel in total control? Are they planning tomorrow's menu today? Has the quality of their life decreased as the quality of their diet increased? Have they become stricter with themselves? Does their self-esteem get a boost from eating healthy? Do they look down on others who don't eat this way? Do they skip foods they once enjoyed in order to eat the "right" foods? Does their diet make it difficult for them to eat anywhere but at home, distancing them from family and friends? Do they feel guilt or self-loathing when they stray from their diet? If yes was answered to two or more questions, the person may have a mild case of orthorexia.<ref name="webmd.com"/>

==Symptoms and theory==
Symptoms of ''orthorexia nervosa'' may include obsession with [[healthy eating]] and [[emaciation]], among other things. Orthorexic subjects typically have specific feelings towards different types of food.  The obsession for healthy foods could come from a number of sources such as family habits, society trends, economic problems, recent illness, or even just hearing something negative about a food type or group, which then leads them to ultimately eliminate the food or foods from their diet.<ref name="Getz"/>
According to the abstract of a 2004 study quoted on [[PubMed]], a service of the [[National Institutes of Health]], "The analysis of the physiological characteristics, the social-cultural and the psychological behaviour that characterises subjects suffering from ON shows a higher prevalence in men and in those with a lower level of education."<ref name="Donini 2004"/>

== Criticism and media reaction ==
The definition of orthorexia as a mental illness has attracted much media attention.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4389849.stm</ref><ref>http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1963297,00.html</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Orthorexia: Too Much Of A Healthy Thing? |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/26/orthorexia-nervosa_n_937268.html|date=26 August 2011 |publisher=[[Huffington Post]]}}</ref> There is often the reaction that the diagnoses risks mistaking personal taste and preference for food and [[healthy diet]] for a deeper rooted [[anxiety disorder]]. As well, genuine sensitivities due to [[food intolerances]] or [[food allergies|allergies]] risk being [[Medical_error#Misdiagnosis_of_psychological_disorders|misdiagnosed]].

== Biology of orthorexia nervosa ==
There has been no investigation into whether there may be a biological cause specific to orthorexia nervosa.  However, Donini et al. link orthorexia to a food-centered manifestation of [[Obsessive compulsive disorder#Biological explanations|obsessive compulsive disorder]], which has a lot to do with control.<ref name="Getz"/>
A 2013 study of college students found that orthorexia severity was negatively associated with self-reported executive functioning.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A neuropsychological evaluation of orthorexia nervosa|year=2013}}</ref>
