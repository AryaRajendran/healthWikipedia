'''Balanitis''' ({{IPAc-en|b|æ|l|ə|ˈ|n|aɪ|t|ɪ|s}};<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/balanitis Entry "balanitis"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref> from {{lang-el|βάλανος}} ''{{lang|el-Latn|balanos}}'' "acorn") is [[inflammation]] of the [[glans penis]]. When the [[foreskin]] is also affected, it is termed [[balanoposthitis]].

Balanitis on boys still in [[diaper]]s must be distinguished from the normal redness seen in boys caused by ammoniacal dermatitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Simpson ET, Barraclough P |title=The management of the paediatric foreskin |journal=Aust Fam Physician |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=381–3 |year=1998 |pmid=9613002 |doi= |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/hygiene/simpson1/}}</ref>

==Etiology and epidemiology==

Inflammation has many possible causes, including irritation by environmental substances, physical trauma, and infection by a wide variety of pathogens, including bacteria, virus, [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, or fungus&mdash;each of which require a particular treatment.<ref name=Edwards>{{cite journal |author=Edwards S |title=Balanitis and balanoposthitis: a review |journal=Genitourin Med |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=155–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8707315 |pmc=1195642 |doi= |url=}} <!-- http://www.circs.org/library/edwards/ --></ref><ref>[http://my.clevelandclinic.org/disorders/penile_disorders/hic_disorders_of_the_penis.aspx Cleveland Clinic: Penile Disorders]</ref>

O'Farrell ''et al.'' (2005) report that failure to wash the whole penis, including retraction of the [[foreskin]], is more common among balanitis sufferers.<ref name="ofarrell2005" /> Birley ''et al.'' (1993), however, found that excessive genital washing with soap may be a strong contributing factor to the condition.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Birley HD |title=Clinical features and management of recurrent balanitis; association with atopy and genital washing |journal=Genitourin Med |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=400–3 |year=1993 |pmid=8244363 |pmc=1195128 |doi= |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Walker MM |author3=Luzzi GA |display-authors=3 |last4=Bell |first4=R |last5=Taylor-Robinson |first5=D |last6=Byrne |first6=M |last7=Renton |first7=AM}} <!-- http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/balanitis/birley/ --></ref> Diabetes can make balanitis more likely, especially if the blood sugar is poorly controlled.

===Prevalence===

According to Leber, balanitis "is a common condition affecting 11% of adult men seen in urology clinics and 3% of children" in the United States; globally balanitis "may occur in up to 3% of uncircumcised males".<ref>{{EMedicine|article|777026|Balanitis}}</ref>

Escala and Rickwood (1989) in an examination of 100 cases of balanitis in childhood, concluded that the risk "in any individual, uncircumcised boy appears to be no greater than 4%.".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Escala JM, Rickwood AM |title=Balanitis |journal=Br J Urol |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=196–7 |year=1989 |pmid=2702407 |doi= 10.1111/j.1464-410X.1989.tb05164.x|url=http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/balanitis/escala1/}}</ref> Øster (1968) reported no balanitis in 9,545 observations of uncircumcised Danish boys.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Øster J |title=Further fate of the foreskin.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis may include careful identification of the cause with the aid of a good patient history, swabs and cultures, and pathological examination of a biopsy.<ref name=Edwards/>

==Symptoms==
Symptoms usually begin to appear after 3 days and can include:
* First signs – small red erosions on the glans
* Redness of the foreskin
* Redness of the penis
* Other rashes on the head of the penis
* Foul smelling discharge
* Painful foreskin and penis

==Complications==
Recurrent bouts of balanitis may cause scarring of the [[Foreskin|preputial orifice]]; the reduced elasticity may lead to [[Phimosis|pathologic phimosis]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|777539|Phimosis}}</ref>
