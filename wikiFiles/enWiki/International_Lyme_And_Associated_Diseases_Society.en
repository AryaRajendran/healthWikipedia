The '''International Lyme And Associated Diseases Society''' (ILADS, pronounced {{IPA|/ˈaɪlædz/}}) is a [[non-profit group|non-profit]] [[interest group]] which advocates for greater acceptance of the controversial medical entity of [[chronic Lyme disease]].<ref name="forbes">{{cite news | work = [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] | first = David | last = Whelan | title = Lyme, Inc. | url = http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0312/096.html | date = March 12, 2007 | accessdate = July 6, 2009}}</ref> 

[[Lyme_disease#Controversy_and_politics|Controversy exists]] as to the existence and proper treatment of chronic Lyme disease.<ref name="nejm-cld">{{cite journal |author=Feder HM, Johnson BJ, O'Connell S, ''et al.'' |title=A critical appraisal of "chronic Lyme disease" |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=357 |issue=14 |pages=1422–30 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17914043 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra072023 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/14/1422}}</ref> Major patient advocacy organizations, as well as the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] support the ILADS position. In addition, several states including California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island have laws protecting doctors who use ILADS treatment guidelines.<ref>http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/05-06/bill/asm/ab_0551-0600/ab_592_bill_20050922_chaptered.html</ref><ref>http://www.ct.gov/dph/cwp/view.asp?A=3659&Q=443628</ref><ref>http://www.mass.gov/legis/11budget/senate/outsides.htm</ref><ref>http://www.dem.ri.gov/pubs/bill02p.htm</ref> Major US medical authorities, including the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]], the [[American Academy of Neurology]], and the [[National Institutes of Health]], have stated that there is no convincing evidence that ''Borrelia'' is involved in chronic Lyme disease. Along with a few physicians, ILADS has questioned the generalizability and reliability of some of the trials referred to by IDSA and the reliability of the current diagnostic tests.<ref name="Stricker 2007">{{cite journal |author=Stricker RB |title=Counterpoint: long-term antibiotic therapy improves persistent symptoms associated with Lyme disease |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=149–57 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17578772 |doi=10.1086/518853 |url=}}</ref> 

As a result of this fundamentally different view of the nature of long-term effects of ''Borrelia'' infection, ILADS has produced treatment recommendations which conflict with those of major mainstream medical bodies. A 2004 article in the ''Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal'' on the prevalence of inaccurate online information about Lyme disease cited the ILADS website as a source of such inaccurate material.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cooper JD, Feder HM |title=Inaccurate information about lyme disease on the internet |journal=Pediatr.

==Physician training program ==
ILADS announced in 2008 that it had started a physician's training program in conjunction with the Turn the Corner Foundation (TTCF).<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/123645.php ILADS announces physician training program]</ref>  According to the TTCF, it also gave a grant to develop a DNA-based detection test for Lyme disease.<ref>[http://www.turnthecorner.org/international-lyme-disease-ILADS.htm TTCF grants]</ref>
