'''CADASIL''' ('''c'''erebral '''a'''utosomal '''d'''ominant '''a'''rteriopathy with '''s'''ubcortical '''i'''nfarcts and '''l'''eukoencephalopathy) is the most common form of hereditary [[stroke]] disorder, and is thought to be caused by mutations of the ''[[Notch 3]]'' gene on [[chromosome 19]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Joutel A, Corpechot C, Ducros A, ''et al.'' |title=Notch3 mutations in CADASIL, a hereditary adult-onset condition causing stroke and dementia |journal=Nature |volume=383 |issue=6602 |pages=707–10 |year=1996 |month=October |pmid=8878478 |doi=10.1038/383707a0 }}</ref> The disease belongs to a family of disorders called the [[Leukodystrophies]]. The most common clinical manifestations are migraine headaches and [[transient ischemic attack]]s or strokes, which usually occur between 40 and 50 years of age, although [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] is able to detect signs of the disease years prior to clinical manifestation of disease.<ref name="Chabriat1995">{{cite journal |author=Chabriat H, Vahedi K, Iba-Zizen MT, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical spectrum of CADASIL: a study of 7 families.

==Signs and symptoms==
CADASIL may start with attacks of [[migraine]] with aura or subcortical transient ischemic attacks or strokes, or mood disorders between 35 to 55 years of age. The disease progresses to [[subcortical dementia]] associated with [[pseudobulbar palsy]] and [[urinary incontinence]].

[[Ischemic stroke]]s are the most frequent presentation of CADASIL, with approximately 85% of symptomatic individuals developing [[transient ischemic attack]]s or stroke(s). The mean age of onset of ischemic episodes is approximately 46 years (range 30–70). A classic [[lacunar syndrome]] occurs in at least two-thirds of affected patients while hemispheric strokes are much less common. Notably, ischemic strokes typically occur in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Recurrent silent strokes, with or without clinical strokes, often lead to cognitive decline and overt subcortical dementia.

==Pathophysiology==
The underlying pathology of CADASIL is progressive degeneration of the smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. Mutations in the ''[[Notch 3]]'' gene (on the short arm of chromosome 19) cause an abnormal accumulation of Notch 3 at the [[cytoplasmic]] membrane of vascular smooth-muscle cells both in cerebral and extracerebral vessels,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Joutel A, Andreux F, Gaulis S, ''et al.'' |title=The ectodomain of the Notch3 receptor accumulates within the cerebrovasculature of CADASIL patients |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=105 |issue=5 |pages=597–605 |year=2000|month=March |pmid=10712431 |pmc=289174 |doi=10.1172/JCI8047 }}</ref> seen as granular [[osmiophilic]] deposits on [[electron microscopy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ruchoux MM, Guerouaou D, Vandenhaute B, Pruvo JP, Vermersch P, Leys D|title=Systemic vascular smooth muscle cell impairment in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy |journal=Acta Neuropathol. |volume=89 |issue=6 |pages=500–12 |year=1995 |pmid=7676806|doi=10.1007/BF00571504}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:CADASIL - very high mag.jpg|thumb|A [[micrograph]] showing punctate [[immunostaining]] (brown) with a Notch 3 [[antibody]], as is characteristic in CADASIL.]]
MRIs show hypointensities on [[Magnetic resonance imaging|T1-weighted images]] and [[hyperintensities]] on [[Magnetic resonance imaging|T2-weighted images]], usually multiple confluent white matter lesions of various sizes, are characteristic. These lesions are concentrated around the [[basal ganglia]], [[periventricular]] [[white matter]], and the [[pons]], and are similar to those seen in [[Binswanger disease]].<ref name="Chabriat1995"/><ref>{{cite book |editor=Ropper AH, Brown RH |chapter=Cerebrovascular Diseases |title=Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=007141620 }}</ref> These white matter lesions are also seen in asymptomatic individuals with the mutated gene.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tournier-Lasserve E, Joutel A, Melki J, ''et al.'' |title=Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy maps to chromosome 19q12 |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=256–9 |year=1993 |month=March |pmid=8485581 |doi=10.1038/ng0393-256 }}</ref>  While MRI is not used to diagnose CADASIL, it can show the progression of white matter changes even decades before onset of symptoms.

The definitive test is sequencing the whole [[Notch 3]] gene, which can be done from a sample of blood. However, as this is quite expensive and CADASIL is a systemic [[arteriopathy]], evidence of the mutation can be found in small and medium-sized arteries. Therefore, skin biopsies are often used for the diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Joutel A, Favrole P, Labauge P, ''et al.'' |title=Skin biopsy immunostaining with a Notch3 monoclonal antibody for CADASIL diagnosis |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9298 |pages=2049–51 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11755616 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)07142-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ueda M, Nakaguma R, Ando Y |title=[Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)] |language=Japanese |journal=Rinsho Byori |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=242–51 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19363995 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
No specific treatment is available.  However, anti-platelet agents such as [[aspirin]], [[dipyridamole]], or [[clopidogrel]] might slow down the disease and help prevent strokes. Given the propensity for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications, minimizing vascular risk factors and implementing therapy for primary or secondary prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction seems prudent. Stopping oral contraceptive pills is justified particularly in cases with migraine with aura. Aggressive treatment of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension is reasonable although the utility of statins and antihypertensive agents in the absence cardiovascular risk factors is unknown. Homocysteine levels are elevated in CADASIL and treatment with folic acid is reasonable. Anti-platelet therapy appears justifiable whereas anticoagulation may be inadvisable given the propensity for microhemorrhages.  Administering tPA following onset of stroke is not advised for CADASIL patients, due to increased risk of microhemorrhages.  Warfarin (Coumadin) should be avoided.
Some CADASIL patients have used L-Arginine, a naturally occurring amino acid, to ease symptoms such as headache.  [[Donepezil|Aricept]], normally used for Alzheimer's Disease, has been shown to improve executive functioning in CADASIL patients.

== In popular culture ==
[[John Ruskin]] has been suggested to have suffered from CADASIL<ref name="Kempster">{{cite journal |author=Kempster PA, Alty JE |title=John Ruskin's relapsing encephalopathy |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 9 |pages=2520–5 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18287121 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn019 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18287121}}</ref> The visual disturbances this caused was reported by Ruskin in his diaries, and it has also been suggested that it might have been a factor in causing him to describe [[James Whistler]]'s [[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket]] as "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face". This resulted in the famous libel trial that resulted in a jury
awarding Whistler one farthing damages.<ref name="Kempster"/>

Recent research into the illness of philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has suggested that his mental illness and death was caused by CADASIL rather than tertiary syphilis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hemelsoet D, Hemelsoet K, Devreese D |title=The neurological illness of Friedrich Nietzsche |journal=Acta Neurol Belg |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=9–16 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18575181 }}</ref> 

The character Julia, in the 2004 Spanish film ''[[The Sea Inside]]'', has the condition.
