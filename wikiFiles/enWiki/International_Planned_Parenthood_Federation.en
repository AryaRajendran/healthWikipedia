{{About|International Planned Parenthood Federation|the United States organization|Planned Parenthood}}
The '''International Planned Parenthood Federation''' ('''IPPF''') is a global [[non-governmental organization]] with the broad aims of promoting sexual and [[reproductive health]], and advocating the right of individuals to make their own choices in [[family planning]]. It was first formed in 1952 in [[Bombay]], [[India]] at the [[Third International Conference on Planned Parenthood]] and now consists of more than 149 Member Associations working in more than 189 countries. The IPPF is highly developed and organized into six regions.

==Purpose==
Member Associations provide non-profit family planning services, sexual health and abuse prevention training and education. Their goals include giving clients the information necessary to make informed sexual health decisions, promoting continuing sexual health, making available high quality sexual health services, improving the overall health of low income individuals, and using democratic organization and the leadership of volunteers to promote these goals. 
Over 40% of the organization's resources are aimed at serving the needs of young people; as the IPPF explains, individuals under 25 (and especially females) are at a much higher risk of getting infected with HIV.<ref>http://www.ippf.org/our-work/what-we-do/adolescents</ref>

==Funding==
The IPPF is financially supported by governments, trusts, and foundations including the European Commission and the United Nations Population Fund for special projects. Half of the balance of their funding comes from government official development assistance programmes. To achieve their goals as an organization, the IPPF often collaborates with the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF), and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The IPPF is a prominent lobbyist in the European Union: specifically, for the European Council and the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). It is the only non-governmental organization (NGO) that focuses on sexual health and reproductive rights to qualify for Consultative Status with the Council of Europe. This allows the IPPF to sit in on the Parliamentary Assembly. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Canadian funding===
In April 2011, it was revealed that IPPF, which had applied for an $18 million grant more than a year previously, had been denied funding by the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government due to lobbying efforts by pro-life groups.<ref>{{cite news|last= MacCharles|first=Tonda|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/978054--anti-abortion-groups-shaped-tory-funding-policy-on-planned-parenthood?bn=1|title= Anti-abortion groups shaped Tory funding policy on Planned Parenthood|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=April 21, 2011}}</ref>

On Sept. 22, 2011, the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] granted IPPF $6 million over three years. The money is for services yet to be rendered in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Mali, Sudan, and Tanzania.<ref>{{cite news|last=Berthiaume|first=Lee|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/canada-in-afghanistan/Anti+abortion+supporters+angered+over+CIDA+funding+abortion+offering/5466752/story.html|title=Anti-abortion supporters angered over CIDA funding for abortion-offering group|publisher=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref> Many anti-abortion activists have been critical of the spending including conservative MP [[Brad Trost]] who criticized his own party for supporting the pro-choice group.<ref>{{cite news|last=Haight|first=Lana|url=http://www.thestarphoenix.com/news/canada-in-afghanistan/Conservative+Trost+criticizes+over+Planned+Parenthood/5474329/story.html|title=Conservative MP Trost criticizes gov't over Planned Parenthood|publisher=[[The StarPhoenix]]|date=September 29, 2011}}</ref>

===United States funding===
IPPF is a [[pro-choice]] organization that advocates for access to [[contraception]] and safe abortion services. This has led IPPF into conflict with conservative social forces, including the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration]] of [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States of America|President]] [[George W. Bush]], who reinstated the [[Mexico City Policy]] in 2001. This policy required [[non-governmental organization]]s in receipt of U.S. funds to refrain from providing birth control and/or abortion-related services, and was first instituted by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984 after lobbying from the Vatican following's Reagan's establishment of official diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974954,00.html ''Time Magazine'' article by Carl Bernstein regarding the "Mexico City Policy", the Reagan administration's capitulation to pressure from the Vatican with quotes from first U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, William A.
