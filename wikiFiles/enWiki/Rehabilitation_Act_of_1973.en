The '''Rehabilitation Act of 1973''' replaces the Vocational Rehabilitation Act, to extend and revise the authorization of grants to States for vocational rehabilitation services, with special emphasis on services to those with the most severe handicaps, to expand special Federal responsibilities and research and training programs with respect to handicapped individuals, to establish special responsibilities in the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for coordination of all programs with respect to handicapped individuals within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and for other purposes. <br />


President [[Richard Nixon]] signed {{USBill|93|hr|8070}} into law on September 26, 1973. <br />
<br />
The U.S. '''Rehabilitation Act of 1973''' prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs conducted by Federal agencies, in programs receiving Federal financial assistance, in Federal employment, and in the employment practices of Federal contractors. The standards for determining employment discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act are the same as those used in title I of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].<ref name="ada web site">[http://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor65610 ADA Web Site]</ref>

==Section 501==
[[Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 501]] requires affirmative action and nondiscrimination in employment by Federal agencies of the executive branch. To obtain more information or to file a complaint, employees should contact their agency's Equal Employment Opportunity Office.<ref name="ada web site"/>

==Section 503==
[[Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 503]] requires affirmative action and prohibits employment discrimination by Federal government contractors and subcontractors with contracts of more than $10,000. <ref name="ada web site"/>

==Section 504==
{{main|Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act}}
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act created and extended civil rights to people with disabilities. Section 504 has provided opportunities for children and adults with disabilities in education, employment and various other settings. It allows for reasonable accommodations such as special study area and assistance as necessary for each student. <ref name="ada web site"/>

Each Federal agency has its own set of section 504 regulations that apply to its own programs. Agencies that provide Federal financial assistance also have section 504 regulations covering entities that receive Federal aid. Requirements common to these regulations include reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities; program accessibility; effective communication with people who have hearing or vision disabilities; and accessible new construction and alterations. Each agency is responsible for enforcing its own regulations. Section 504 may also be enforced through private lawsuits. It is not necessary to file a complaint with a Federal agency or to receive a "right-to-sue" letter before going to court.<ref name="ada web site"/>

==Section 505==
[[Section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 505]] contains provisions governing remedies and attorney's fees under Section 501.<ref>[http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/rehab.cfm Section 505] from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</ref>

==Section 508==
{{main|Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act}}
[[Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 508]] establishes requirements for electronic and information technology developed, maintained, procured, or used by the Federal government. Section 508 requires Federal electronic and information technology to be accessible to people with disabilities, including employees and members of the public.<ref name="ada web site"/>

An accessible information technology system is one that can be operated in a variety of ways and does not rely on a single sense or ability of the user. For example, a system that provides output only in visual format may not be accessible to people with visual impairments and a system that provides output only in audio format may not be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Some individuals with disabilities may need accessibility-related software or peripheral devices in order to use systems that comply with Section 508.<ref name="ada web site"/>
