{{Distinguish2|The Pesthouse, a 2007 novel by [[Jim Crace]]}}
A '''pest house''', '''pesthouse''' or '''fever shed''' was a type of building used for persons afflicted with [[communicable disease]]s such as [[tuberculosis]], [[cholera]], [[smallpox]] or [[typhus]]. Often used for forcible [[quarantine]], many towns and cities had one or more pesthouses accompanied by a cemetery or a waste pond nearby for disposal of the dead.

==Fever sheds in Canada==
{{main|Typhus epidemic of 1847}}
Fever sheds were built in several communities across [[Eastern Canada]] in 1847, to quarantine sick and dying [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, who contracted [[typhus]] during the voyage to the New World during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].
===Montreal===
In [[Montreal]], between 3,500 and 6,000 Irish immigrants died in fever sheds in a quarantine area known as [[Goose Village, Montreal|Windmill Point]]. Three sheds were initially constructed,{{convert|150|ft|m}} long by 40 to{{convert|50|ft|m}} wide. As thousands more sick immigrants landed, more sheds had to be erected.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gallagher |first=The Reverend John A. |year=1936 |title=The Irish Emigration of 1847 and Its Canadian Consequences|journal=CCHA Report, University of Manitoba Web site|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1935-36/Gallagher.html|accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref> The number of sheds would grow to 22, with troops cordoning off the area so the sick couldn't escape.<ref name="Bruemmer">{{cite news|url=http://montrealnewsinfo.blogspot.com/2009/05/seeking-hope-they-found-death.html|title=Seeking hope, they found death|last=Bruemmer|first=Rene|date=2009-05-30|work=Montreal Gazette|publisher=Canwest|accessdate=2009-05-30}}</ref>

===Toronto===
In [[Toronto]], during the summer of 1847, 863 Irish immigrants died of typhus at fever sheds built by the [[Toronto Board of Health]] at the northwest corner of [[King Street (Toronto)|King]] and [[John Street (Toronto)|John Street]]. There were at least 12 sheds, 22 metres long by 7.5 metres wide. <ref name=toplaques>{{cite web|title=Toronto's Historical Plaques|url=http://www.torontoplaques.com/Pages_GHI/Irish_Immigrants_and_the_Fever_Sheds.html|work=Irish Immigrants and the Fever Sheds 1847|accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref> <ref name=BlogTO>{{cite news|title=The UnderTOw: The Fever Sheds|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2007/04/the_undertow_the_fever_sheds/|accessdate=21 January 2012|newspaper=BlogTO|date=11 April 2007}}</ref>

===Saint John, New Brunswick===
[[Partridge Island, New Brunswick]], just outside the main harbour of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], was chosen as the location for a pest house and quarantine station as far back as 1785. In 1847, with a large influx of Irish migrants, the typhus epidemic quickly filled the fever shed with sick and dying. By the 1847 typhus season, 2115 people had died in New Brunswick, with 1196 dying at Partridge Island and in Saint John.<ref name=mccord>{{cite web|title=1967.25A-C {{!}} Partridge Island|url=http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/1967.25A-C|work=[[McCord Museum]]|accessdate=22 January 2012|location=Montreal}}</ref>
