'''Erythropoiesis''' is the process by which [[red blood cell]]s (erythrocytes) are produced. It is stimulated by decreased O<sub>2</sub> in circulation, which is detected by the [[kidney]]s, which then secrete the hormone [[erythropoietin]].<ref name="Sherwood et al 2005">Sherwood, L, Klansman, H, Yancey, P: ''Animal Physiology'', Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning, 2005.</ref> This hormone stimulates proliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors, which activates increased erythropoiesis in the [[hemopoietic]] tissues, ultimately producing [[red blood cells]].<ref name="Sherwood et al 2005" />  In [[postnatal]] [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s (including [[humans]]), this usually occurs within the [[red bone marrow]].<ref name="Sherwood et al 2005" /> In the early [[fetus]], erythropoiesis takes place in the mesodermal cells of the [[yolk sac]].

</ref> However, in [[humans]] with certain [[diseases]] and in some [[animals]], erythropoiesis also occurs outside the [[bone marrow]], within the [[spleen]] or [[liver]]. This is termed ''[[Haematopoiesis#Extramedullary|extramedullary erythropoiesis]]''.

The [[bone marrow]] of essentially all the [[bone]]s produces [[Red blood cell|RBC]]s until a person is around five [[years]] old. The [[tibia]] and [[femur]] cease to be important sites of [[hematopoiesis]] by about age 25; the [[vertebra]]e, [[Human sternum|sternum]], [[pelvis]] and [[rib]]s, and [[cranial bones]] continue to produce red blood cells throughout life.

== Erythrocyte differentiation ==

In the process of red blood cell maturation, a cell undergoes a series of ''[[cellular differentiation|differentiation]]s''. The following stages of development all occur within the [[bone marrow]]:
* [[Hemocytoblast]], a [[multipotent]] [[hematopoietic]] [[stem cell]]
* [[Common Myeloid Progenitor]], a [[multipotent stem cell]]
* [[Unipotent Stem Cell]]
* [[Pronormoblast]], also commonly called Proerythroblast or Rubriblast.
* [[Basophilic Normoblast]]/Early Normoblast, also commonly called Erythroblast
* [[Polychromatophilic Normoblast]]/Intermediate Normoblast
* [[Orthochromatic Normoblast]]/Late Normoblast. Nucleus is expelled before becoming a [[Reticulocyte]]
* [[Reticulocyte]]

The cell is released from the bone marrow after Stage 7, and so of circulating red blood cells there are ~1% reticulocytes. After one to two days, these ultimately become "erythrocytes" or mature red blood cells.

These stages correspond to specific appearances of the cell when stained with [[Wright's stain]] and examined by light microscopy, but correspond to other biochemical changes.

In the process of maturation, a Basophilic Pronormoblast is converted from a cell with a large [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and a volume of 900 [[Femtolitre|fL]] to an [[enucleation|enucleated]] disc with a volume of 95 fL. By the reticulocyte stage, the cell has extruded its nucleus, but is still capable of producing hemoglobin.

Essential for the maturation of RBC'S are [[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] (cobalamin) and [[Vitamin B9|Vitamin B<sub>9</sub>]] (Folic acid). Lack of either of these causes maturation failure in the process of erythropoiesis, which manifests clinically as [[reticulocytopenia]], an abnormally low amount of reticulocytes.

==Characteristics seen in erythrocytes during erythropoiesis==
The following characteristics can be seen changing in the erythrocytes when they are maturing:
* They show a reduction in the cell size;
* The cytoplasmic matrix increases in amount;
* Staining reaction of the cytoplasm changes from blue to pinkish red (this is because of the decrease in the amount of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]]);
* Initially the nucleus was large in size and contained open chromatin. But with the maturation of RBC's the size of the nucleus decreases and finally disappears with the condensation of the chromatin material.<ref>Textbook of Physiology by Dr. A. K. Jain reprint 2006-2007 3rd edition.</ref>

==Regulation of erythropoiesis==
A feedback loop involving [[erythropoietin]] helps regulate the process of erythropoiesis so that, in non-disease states, the production of red blood cells is equal to the destruction of red blood cells and the red blood cell number is sufficient to sustain adequate tissue oxygen levels but not so high as to cause sludging, [[thrombosis]], or [[stroke]]. Erythropoietin is produced in the kidney and liver in response to low oxygen levels. In addition, erythropoietin is bound by circulating red blood cells; low circulating numbers lead to a relatively high level of unbound erythropoietin, which stimulates production in the bone marrow.

Recent studies have also shown that the peptide hormone [[hepcidin]] may play a role in the regulation of hemoglobin production, and thus affect erythropoiesis. The liver produces hepcidin. Hepcidin controls iron absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and iron release from reticuloendothelial tissue. Iron must be released from [[macrophages]] in the bone marrow to be incorporated into the heme group of [[hemoglobin]] in erythrocytes.
There are colony forming units that the cells follow during their formation. These cells are referred to as the committed cells including the granulocyte monocyte colony forming units

Also, loss of function of the erythropoietin receptor or JAK2 in mice cells causes failure in erythropoiesis, so production of red blood cells in embryos and growth is disrupted.

Also, if there is no feedback inhibition, such as SOCS (Suppressors of Cytokine Signaling) proteins in the system, that would cause giantism in mice.<ref name="pmid11930010">{{cite journal | author = Nicolas G, Bennoun M, Porteu A, Mativet S, Beaumont C, Grandchamp B, Sirito M, Sawadogo M, Kahn A, Vaulont S | title = Severe iron deficiency anemia in transgenic mice expressing liver hepcidin | journal = Proc.
