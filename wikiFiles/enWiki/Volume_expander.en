A '''volume expander''' is a type of [[intravenous therapy]] that has the function of providing volume for the [[circulatory system]]. It may be used for [[fluid replacement]].

==Physiology==
When blood is lost, the greatest immediate need is to stop further blood loss. The second greatest need is replacing the lost volume. This way remaining red blood cells can still oxygenate body tissue. Normal human blood has a significant excess oxygen transport capability, only used in cases of great physical exertion. Provided blood volume is maintained by volume expanders, a [[wikt:quiescent|quiescent]] patient can safely tolerate very low haemoglobin levels, less than 1/3 that of a healthy person.

The body automatically detects the lower haemoglobin level, and compensatory mechanisms start up. The [[heart]] pumps more blood with each beat. Since the lost blood was replaced with a suitable fluid, the now diluted blood flows more easily, even in the small vessels. As a result of chemical changes, more oxygen is released to the tissues. These adaptations are so effective that if only half of the red blood cells remain, oxygen delivery may still be about 75 percent of normal. A patient at rest uses only 25 percent of the oxygen available in his blood. In extreme cases, patients have survived with a haemoglobin level of 2 g/dl, about 1/7 the norm, although levels this low are very dangerous.

With enough blood loss, ultimately red blood cell levels drop too low for adequate tissue oxygenation, even if volume expanders maintain circulatory volume. In these situations, the only alternatives are blood transfusions, packed red blood cells, or oxygen therapeutics (if available). However in some circumstances, [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] can maintain adequate tissue oxygenation even if red blood cell levels are below normal life-sustaining levels.

==Types==
There are two main types of volume expanders; crystalloids and colloids. Crystalloids are aqueous [[solution]]s of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules. Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules, such as [[gelatin]]; [[blood]] itself is a colloid.

===Colloids===
Colloids preserve a high [[colloid osmotic pressure]] in the blood, while, on the other hand, this parameter is decreased by crystalloids due to hemodilution.<ref name=gregory>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/503138 An Update on Intravenous Fluids] by Gregory S. Martin, MD, MSc</ref> Therefore, they should theoretically preferentially increase the [[intravascular volume]], whereas crystalloids also increase the [[interstitial volume]] and [[intracellular volume]]. However, there is still controversy as to the actual difference in efficacy due to this difference in action.<ref name=gregory/> Another difference is that crystalloids generally are much cheaper than colloids.<ref name=gregory/>

====Hydroxyethyl starch====
{{Main|Hydroxyethyl starch}}
''Hydroxyethyl starch'' (HES/HAES, common trade names: Hespan, Voluven) is one of the most frequently used colloids. An intravenous solution of hydroxyethyl starch is used to prevent [[Shock (medical)|shock]] following severe [[blood]] loss caused by [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[surgery]], or some other problem. It increases the [[blood volume]], allowing [[red blood cell]]s to continue to deliver [[oxygen]] to the body.

====Gelofusine====
{{Main|Gelofusine}}
''Gelofusine'' is a volume expander that is used as a [[blood]] plasma replacement if a significant amount of blood is lost due to extreme [[hemorrhaging|hemorrhagia]], trauma, dehydration, or a similar event.It is an intravenous colloid that behaves much like blood filled with albumins. As a result, it causes an increase in blood volume, blood flow, cardiac output, and [[oxygen]] transportation.

===Crystalloids===
The most commonly used crystalloid fluid is ''normal [[Saline (medicine)|saline]]'', a solution of [[sodium chloride]] at 0.9% concentration, which is close to the concentration in the blood ([[Isotonicity|isotonic]]). ''[[Ringer's lactate]]'' or ''Ringer's acetate'' is another isotonic solution often used for large-volume fluid replacement. A solution of 5% [[dextrose]] in water, sometimes called D5W, is often used instead if the patient is at risk for having low [[blood sugar]] or high [[sodium]]. The choice of fluids may also depend on the chemical properties of the medications being given.

Intravenous fluids must always be [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]].

====Ringer's solution====
[[Lactated Ringer's solution]] contains 28&nbsp;mmol/L lactate, 4&nbsp;mmol/L K<sup>+</sup> and 1.5&nbsp;mmol/L Ca<sup>2+</sup>. It is very similar&nbsp;– though not identical to&nbsp;– [[Hartmann's Solution]], the ionic concentrations of which differ.

====Normal saline====
{{Main|Saline (medicine)}}
''Normal saline'' (NS) is the commonly-used term for a solution of 0.91% [[percentage solution|w/v]] of [[sodium chloride|NaCl]], about 300 [[Osmolality|mOsm]]/L.<ref>Note that in [[chemistry]], a one normal of NaCl (see [[Concentration#Normality|normality]]) is 0.5 molar (see [[molarity]]) NaCl assuming complete dissociation. Physiological dissociation is approximately 1.7 ions per mole, so one normal of NaCl is 1/1.7 = 0.588 molar.  This is roughly 4 times more concentrated than medical "normal saline" of 0.154 molar.</ref> Less commonly, this solution is referred to as ''physiological saline'' or ''isotonic saline'', neither of which is technically accurate. NS is used frequently in [[intravenous drip]]s (IVs) for patients who cannot take fluids orally and have developed or are in danger of developing [[dehydration]] or [[hypovolemia]]. NS is typically the first fluid used when hypovolemia is severe enough to threaten the adequacy of blood circulation, and has long been believed to be the safest fluid to give quickly in large volumes. However, it is now known that rapid infusion of NS can cause [[metabolic acidosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal

====Glucose (dextrose)====
[[Intravenous sugar solution]]s, such as with [[glucose]] (also called dextrose), have the advantage of providing some energy, and may thereby provide the entire or part of the energy component of [[parenteral nutrition]].

Types of glucose/dextrose include:
*'''D5W''' (5% dextrose in water), which consists of 278&nbsp;mmol/L dextrose
*'''D5NS''' (5% dextrose in normal saline), which, in addition, contains normal saline.
