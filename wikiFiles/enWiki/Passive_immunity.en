'''Passive immunity''' is the transfer of ''active'' [[humoral immunity]] in the form of ready-made antibodies, from one individual to another. Passive [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta, and can also be induced artificially, when high levels of [[human]] (or [[horse]]) [[antibodies]] specific for a [[pathogen]] or [[toxin]] are transferred to non-[[immune system|immune]] individuals. '''Passive immunization''' is used when there is a high risk of infection and insufficient time for the body to develop its own immune response, or to reduce the symptoms of ongoing or [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] diseases.<ref name=USC>[http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/ghaffar/immunization.htm Microbiology and Immunology On-Line Textbook]: USC School of Medicine</ref> 
==Naturally acquired passive immunity==
Maternal passive immunity is a type of naturally acquired passive immunity, and refers to [[antibody]]-mediated immunity conveyed to a [[fetus]] by its mother during pregnancy. Maternal antibodies (MatAb) are passed through the [[placenta]] to the fetus by an [[FcRn]] receptor on placental cells. This occurs around the third month of [[gestation]].<ref name=Coico>Coico, R., Sunshine, G., and Benjamin, E. (2003). "Immunology: A Short Course." Pg. 48.</ref> [[IgG|Immunoglobulin G]] is the only antibody [[Isotype (immunology)|isotype]] that can pass through the placenta.<ref name=Coico/> Immunization is often required shortly following birth to prevent diseases such as [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis B]], [[polio]], and [[pertussis]], however, maternal antibodies can inhibit the induction of protective vaccine responses throughout the first year of life.  This effect is usually overcome by secondary responses to booster immunization.<ref>Lambert, Paul-Henri, Margaret Liu and Claire-Anne Siegrist [http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v11/n4s/full/nm1216.html#B57 ''Can successful vaccines teach us how to induce efficient protective immune responses?'' (Full text-html)] Nature Medicine  11, S54 - S62 (2005).</ref> 

Passive immunity is also provided through the transfer of [[IgA]] antibodies found in [[breast milk]] that are transferred to the gut of the infant, protecting against bacterial infections, until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies.<ref name=Janeway>{{cite book | last = Janeway | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Janeway | coauthors = Paul Travers, Mark Walport, and Mark Shlomchik | title = Immunobiology; Fifth Edition | publisher = Garland Science | year = 2001 | location = New York and London| pages =  | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10| doi =  | isbn = 0-8153-4101-6}}.</ref>

==Artificially acquired passive immunity==
{{See also|artificial induction of immunity#Temporarily induced immunity|l1=Temporarily induced immunity}}

Artificially acquired passive immunity is a short-term immunization achieved by the transfer of antibodies, which can be administered in several forms; as human or animal [[blood plasma]] or [[Blood serum|serum]], as pooled human immunoglobulin for intravenous ([[IVIG]]) or intramuscular (IG) use, as high-titer human IVIG or IG from immunized donors or from donors recovering from the disease, and as [[monoclonal antibodies]] (MAb). Passive transfer is used [[prophylactic]]ally in the case of [[immunodeficiency]] diseases, such as [[hypogammaglobulinemia]].<ref name= Keller>Keller, Margaret A. and E. Richard Stiehm [http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/13/4/602 ''Passive Immunity in Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases''] Clinical Microbiology Reviews, October 2000, p. 602-614, Vol. 13, No. 4</ref> It is also used in the treatment of several types of acute infection, and to treat [[poison]]ing.<ref name=USC/> Immunity derived from passive immunization lasts for only a short period of time, and there is also a potential risk for [[hypersensitivity]] reactions, and [[serum sickness]], especially from [[gamma globulin]] of non-human origin.<ref name=Janeway/> Passive immunity provides immediate protection, but the body does not develop memory, therefore the patient is at risk of being infected by the same pathogen later.<ref name=Janeway/>

===History and applications of artificial passive immunity===
The birth of passive immunotherapy may have begun with [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]], who sought to harden himself against poison, and took daily sub-lethal doses of poison to build tolerance. Mithridates is also said to have fashioned a 'universal antidote' to protect him from all earthly poisons.<ref name=Silverstein>Silverstein, Arthur M. (1989) History of Immunology (Hardcover) Academic Press. Note: The first six pages of this text are available online at: ([http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/012643770X/ Amazon.com easy reader])</ref>  For nearly 2000 years, poisons were thought to be the [[proximal]] cause of disease, and a complicated mixture of ingredients, called [[Mithridate]], was used to cure poisoning during the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=Silverstein/> An updated version, [[Theriacum Andromachi]], was used well into the 19th century.<ref>{{note label|1728|1|^}}{{1728}} "[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&entity=HistSciTech000900250210&isize=L Mithridate]".</ref> [[Image:Antitoxin diphtheria.jpg|thumb|150px|A vial of diphtheria antitoxin, dated 1895]]
In 1888 [[Emile Roux]] and [[Alexandre Yersin]] isolated [[diphtheria toxin]], and following the 1890 discovery of an [[antitoxin]]-based immunity to [[diphtheria]] and [[tetanus]], by [[Emil Adolf von Behring]] and [[Kitasato Shibasabur≈ç]], antitoxin became the first major success of modern therapeutic immunology.<ref name=Silverstein/> 

The artificial induction of passive immunity has been used for over a century to treat infectious disease, and prior to the advent of [[antibiotics]], was often the only specific agents available to treat certain infections. Immunoglobulin therapy continued to be a first line therapy in the treatment of severe [[respiratory disease]]s until the 1930s, even after [[sulfonamides]] were introduced.<ref name= Keller/> 

In 1890 antibody therapy was used to treat [[tetanus]], when serum from immunized horses was injected into patients with severe tetanus in an attempt to neutralize the tetanus toxin, and prevent the dissemination of the disease. Since the 1960s, human tetanus immune globulin (TIG) has been used in the United States in un-immunized or incompletely immunized patients who have sustained wounds consistent with the development of tetanus.<ref name= Keller/> The administration of horse [[antitoxin]] remains the only specific pharmacologic treatment available for [[botulism]].<ref>Shapiro, Roger L. MD; Charles Hatheway, PhD; and David L. Swerdlow, MD [http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/129/3/221?ijkey=360c044072fcb6ead39e0866dcdbba9c51784956 ''Botulism in the United States: A Clinical and Epidemiologic Review''] Annals of Internal Medicine. 1 August 1998 Volume 129 Issue 3 Pages 221-228</ref> Antitoxin is often also given prophylactically to individuals known to have ingested contaminated food. IVIG treatment was also used successfully to treat several victims of [[toxic shock syndrome]], during the 1970s [[Rely tampons|tampon scare]]. 

Antibody therapy is also used to treat viral infections. In 1945, [[hepatitis A]] infections, epidemic in summer camps, were successfully prevented by immunoglobulin treatment. Similarly, [[hepatitis B]] immune globulin (HBIG) effectively prevents hepatitis B infection. Antibody prophylaxis of both hepatitis A and B has largely been supplanted by the introduction of vaccines; however, it is still indicated following exposure and prior to travel to areas of endemic infection.<ref>Casadevall, A., and M. D. Scharff. 1995. ''Return to the past: the case for antibody-based therapies in infectious diseases''. Clin. Infect. Dis. 21:150-161</ref>

In 1953, human [[vaccinia]] immunoglobulin (VIG) was used to prevent the spread of [[smallpox]] during an outbreak in [[Madras, India]], and continues to be used to treat complications arising from smallpox vaccination. Although the prevention of [[measles]] is typically induced through vaccination, it is often treated immuno-prophylactically upon exposure. Prevention of [[rabies]] infection still requires the use of both vaccine and immunoglobulin treatments.<ref name= Keller/>

During a 1995 [[Ebola]] virus outbreak in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], whole blood from recovering patients, and containing anti-Ebola antibodies, was used to treat eight patients, as no effective means of prevention or treatment currently exists.  Only one of the eight infected patients died, compared to a typical 80% Ebola mortality, which suggested that antibody treatment may contribute to survival.<ref>Mupapa, K., M. Massamba, K. Kibadi, K. Kivula, A. Bwaka, M. Kipasa, R. Colebunders, and J. J. Muyembe-Tamfum on behalf of the International Scientific and Technical Committee. 1999. Treatment of Ebola hemorrhagic fever with blood transfusions from convalescent patients. J. Infect. Dis. 179(Suppl.):S18-S23</ref> Immunoglobulin has been used to both prevent and treat reactivation of the [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV), [[varicella zoster virus]], [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV), and [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV).<ref name= Keller/>

==Passive transfer of cell-mediated immunity==
The one exception to passive humoral immunity is the passive transfer of [[cell-mediated immunity]], also called '''adoptive immunization''' which involves the transfer of mature circulating lymphocytes. It is rarely used in humans, and requires [[histocompatibility|histocompatible]] (matched) donors, which are often difficult to find, and carries severe risks of [[graft-versus-host disease]].<ref name=USC/>  This technique has been used in humans to treat certain diseases including some types of [[cancer]] and [[immunodeficiency]]. However, this specialized form of passive immunity is most often used in a laboratory setting in the field of [[immunology]], to transfer immunity between "[[congenic]]", or [[animal model|deliberately inbred]] mouse strains which are histocompatible.
