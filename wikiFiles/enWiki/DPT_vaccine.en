'''DPT''' (also '''DTP''' and '''DTwP''') refers to a class of combination [[vaccine]]s against three [[infectious disease]]s in humans:  [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]] (whooping cough) and [[tetanus]].  The vaccine components include diphtheria and tetanus [[toxoids]], and killed whole cells of the organism that causes pertussis (wP).

'''DTaP''' and '''Tdap''' refer to similar combination vaccines in which the pertussis component is acellular.

Also available is the '''DT''' or '''TD vaccine''', which lacks the pertussis component.

In the [[Netherlands]] and in [[France]], the acronym DTP refers to a combination vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, and [[poliomyelitis]].  In the Netherlands, pertussis is known as ''kinkhoest'' and '''DKTP''' refers to a combination vaccine against diphtheria, pertussis/kinkhoest, tetanus, and polio.

The   usual course of childhood immunization is five doses between 2 months and 15 years.  For adults, separate combination vaccines are used that adjust the relative concentrations of their components.

While vaccinations helped eradicate [[pertussis]] from the United States in the latter half of the 20th century, in recent years the disease resurfaced and resulted in fatalities.<ref name="vaccine refusal">{{cite news  |title = Is Vaccine Refusal Worth The Risk?  |publisher = ''NPR'' |date = 2009-05-26 |url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104523437 |accessdate = 2009-06-19 }}</ref> Many parents decline to vaccinate their children against the disease for fear of side effects.<ref name="vaccine refusal"/> In 2009, ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' concluded the largest risk among unvaccinated children is the disease the vaccination is designed to protect against.<ref name="vaccine refusal"/>

==Combination vaccines with acellular pertussis==

'''DTap''' and '''Tdap''' are both combined vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.  The difference is in the dosage, with the upper case letters meaning higher quantity.<ref>[http://www.jaapa.com/the-difference-between-tdap-and-dtap-dabigatran-versus-warfarin/article/193926/ The difference between Tdap and DTaP; dabigatran versus warfarin - JAAPA]</ref> The names are easy to confuse, and the [http://www.ismp.org/ Institute for Safe Medication Practices] reports hundreds of cases of accidental mix-ups.<ref>[http://www.ismp.org/newsletters/acutecare/articles/20100701.asp DTaP-Tdap mix-ups now affecting hundreds of patients]</ref>

===DTaP===
'''DTaP''' (also '''DTPa''' and '''TDaP''') is a combined vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, in which the pertussis component is acellular.  This is in contrast to whole-cell, inactivated DTP (aka DTwP).  The acellular vaccine uses selected antigens of the pertussis pathogen to induce immunity.  Because it uses fewer antigens than the whole cell vaccines, it is considered safer, but it is also more expensive.  Recent research suggests that the DTP vaccine is more effective than DTaP in conferring immunity; this is because DTaP's narrower antigen base is less effective against current pathogen strains.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The acellular vaccine is safer to administer in that it causes substantially fewer side-effects (estimated at 90% fewer), which commonly include local pain and redness, or fever.

DTaP was developed in Japan in 1981.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Tdap===
<!-- pertussis toxoid? -->
'''Tdap''', sometimes known as '''dTap''',<ref>{{cite web |title=Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme |year=2007 |url=http://www.chp.gov.hk/faq_dtl.asp?lang=en&faq_id=8349&id=117&pid=24}}</ref> is the acronym for the collective [[vaccines]] preventing [[tetanus]], [[diphtheria]], and [[pertussis]] in [[adolescents]] and [[adults]] that were licensed in the United States in spring of 2005. These vaccines differ from the childhood [[DTaP]] vaccines (brand name Daptacel)  in their indication.  As indicated by the lower case "d" and "p", the concentration of diphtheria and pertussis [[toxoids]] has been reduced in these "adult" formulations to prevent [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]], while the "a" in "ap" indicates that the pertussis toxoids are acellular. Two Tdap vaccines are available in the U.S. Adacel, manufactured by [[Sanofi Pasteur]], is licensed for use in adults ages 11 to 64.  Boostrix, manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline]], is licensed for use in adolescents and adults ages 10 to 64.  The U.S.'s [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP) has recommended its use in adults of all ages, including those age 65 and above. After the 2010 passage of Assembly Bill 354, the State of California requires all students entering grades 7-12 provide proof of tDap vaccination as a condition of enrollment in both public and private schools.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Updated recommendations for use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, 2010 |journal=MMWR Morb.

The U.S.'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization ([[NACI]]) recommended that both adolescents and adults receive Tdap in place of their next Td booster (recommended to be given every 10 years).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Broder KR, Cortese MM, Iskander JK, ''et al.'' |title=Preventing tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis among adolescents: use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccines recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=55 |issue=RR–3 |pages=1–34 |year=2006 |month=Mar |pmid=16557217 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5503a1.htm}}, page 18.</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= |title=ACIP Votes to Recommend Use of Combined Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine for Adults  |date= |work= |publisher= |url=http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vaccine/tdap/tdap_adult_recs.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= |title=Interval Between Administration of Vaccines Against Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis |work= |publisher= |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/05vol31/acs-dcc-8-9/9_e.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kretsinger K, Broder KR, Cortese MM, ''et al.'' |title=Preventing tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis among adults: use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and recommendation of ACIP, supported by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), for use of Tdap among health-care personnel |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=55 |issue=RR–17 |pages=1–37 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17167397 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5517a1.htm}}</ref> Tdap can be used as prophylaxis for tetanus in wound management. Five years between doses of Td or doses of Td and Tdap is the current standard of care; frequent exposure to tetanus toxoid can cause local reactions. People who will be in contact with young infants are encouraged to get Tdap even if it has been less than 5 years since Td or TT to reduce the risk of infants being exposed to pertussis. The ACIP statement on Tdap use in adolescents encourages 5 years between Td and Tdap to reduce this{{specify|date=February 2012}} risk; however, both suggest that shorter intervals may be appropriate in some circumstances, such as for protection in pertussis outbreaks.  NACI suggests intervals shorter than 5 years can be used for catch-up programs and other instances where programmatic concerns make 5-year intervals difficult.

==Thimerosal==
[[Thimerosal]] is a preservative sometimes used with certain vaccines.  Out of the eight manufactured DPT vaccines, only three ever contained thimerosal.  Currently, seven out of the eight DPT vaccines on the market do not use thimerosal, and the product that does (Tripedia) contains trace levels, less than 0.3 micrograms per dose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thiomersal in Vaccines |author= United States Food and Drug Administration |url=http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/safetyavailability/vaccinesafety/ucm096228.htm#t1}}</ref> The [[World Health Organization]] has concluded that there is no evidence of toxicity from thimerosal in vaccines.<ref>{{cite web |title= Thiomersal and vaccines

==Medication errors{{anchor | Medication Errors}}==
In August 2006, the non-profit patient safety organization [[Institute for Safe Medication Practices]] described medication errors from the confusion between the two different formulations.<ref>{{cite web |author= |title=Adacel (Tdap) and Daptacel (DTaP) confusion |date=August 24, 2006 |work=ISMP Medication Safety Alert! |publisher=Institute for Safe Medication Practices |url=http://www.ismp.org/Newsletters/acutecare/articles/20060824_2.asp}}</ref>

There were several mix-ups between DAPTACEL and ADACEL. Daptacel is for active immunization in infants and children 6 weeks to 6 years old. Adacel is indicated for active booster immunization as a single dose in persons 11 to 64 years old and is the first vaccine approved as a pertussis booster for adults. The component antigens in Adacel and Daptacel are the same, but the relative amounts are much greater with the infant vaccination. As such, these are easy to confuse.

In one clinic, 13 adults were vaccinated with Daptacel in error. At another clinic, seven adults received Daptacel instead of Adacel. None of the patients appeared to have experienced any unusual vaccine reactions despite the fact that the pediatric formulation contains greater amounts of the detoxified pertussis toxin and diphtheria toxoid. The similarities of the brand names, generic designations, and vaccine abbreviations (Tdap and DTaP) were felt to have contributed to the confusion.

The [[World Health Organization]] recommends a pentavalent vaccine, combining the DTP vaccine with vaccines against [[Haemophilus influenzae|''Haemophilus influenzae'' type B]] and [[hepatitis B]]. There is not yet sufficient evidence on how effective this pentavalent vaccine is in relation to the individual vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bar-On ES, Goldberg E, Hellmann S, Leibovici L |title=Combined DTP-HBV-HIB vaccine versus separately administered DTP-HBV and HIB vaccines for primary prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae B (HIB) |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD005530 |year=2012 |pmid=22513932 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005530.pub3}}</ref>

==In pregnancy==
Guidelines on [[prenatal care in the United States]] state that, if an urgent need for tetanus protection occurs during pregnancy, [[Td vaccine]] should be administered.<ref name=icsi2010>[http://www.icsi.org/prenatal_care_4/prenatal_care__routine__full_version__2.html Health Care Guideline: Routine Prenatal Care.
