'''Chloroform''' is an [[organic compound]] with [[chemical formula|formula]] [[Carbon|C]][[Hydrogen|H]][[Chlorine|Cl]]<sub>3</sub>. It is one of the four [[chloromethane]]s.<ref name=Ullmann/> The colorless, sweet-smelling, dense liquid is a [[trihalomethane]], and is considered somewhat hazardous. Several million tons are produced annually as a precursor to [[PTFE]] and refrigerants, but its use for refrigerants is being phased out.<ref name=Ullmann>M. Rossberg ''et al.'' “Chlorinated Hydrocarbons” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_233.pub2}}</ref>

==Occurrence==
Chloroform has a multitude of natural sources, both [[biogenic]] and [[abiotic]]. It is estimated that greater than 90% of atmospheric chloroform is of natural origin.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110721191209/http://www.eurochlor.org/upload/documents/document56.pdf Naturally-Occurring Organochlorines]. eurochlor.org</ref>

===Marine===
In particular, chloroform is produced by brown seaweeds (''[[Laminaria digitata]]'', ''[[Laminaria saccharina]]'', ''[[Fucus serratus]]'', ''[[Pelvetia canaliculata]]'', ''[[Ascophyllum nodosum]]''), red seaweeds (''Gigartina stellata'', ''[[Corallina officinalis]]'', ''[[Polysiphonia]] lanosa''), and green seaweeds (''[[Ulva lactuca]]'', ''[[Enteromorpha]]'' sp., ''[[Cladophora]] albida'').<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Nightingale PB, Malin G, Liss PS|year=1995|title=Production of Chloroform and Other Low- Molecular-Weight Halocarbons by Some Species of Macroalgae|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=40|page=680|issue=4|publisher=American Society of Limnology and Oceanography|jstor=2838303}}</ref> Similarly, the macroalga ''Eucheuma denticulatum'', which is cultivated and harvested on a large scale for [[carrageenan]] production, produces chloroform,<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/09670269600651241|title=Stress-induced production of volatile halogenated organic compounds in Eucheuma denticulatum (Rhodophyta) caused by elevated pH and high light intensities|year=1996|last1=Mtolera|first1=Matern|last2=Collén|first2=Jonas|last3=Pedersén|first3=Marianne|last4=Ekdahl|first4=Anja|last5=Abrahamsson|first5=Katarina|last6=Semesi|first6=Adelaida|journal=European Journal of Phycology|volume=31|issue=1|page=89 }}</ref> as do ''Hypnea spinella'', ''Falkenbergia hillebrandii'', and ''Gracilara cornea'' along with seven indigenous macroalgae inhabiting a rock pool.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ekdahl A, Pedersen M, Abrahamsson K|year=1998|title=A Study of the Diurnal Variation of Biogenic Volatile Halocarbons|journal= Mar Chem|volume=63|page=1}}</ref> These studies show increased chloroform production with increased light intensity, presumably when photosynthesis is also increased.

==Production==
Chloroform was discovered by three researchers independently of one another. Chloroform was reported in 1831 by the French [[chemist]] [[Eugène Soubeiran]], who prepared it from [[acetone]] (2-propanone) as well as [[ethanol]] through the action of chlorine [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]] powder ([[calcium hypochlorite]]).<ref>{{Cite journal

===Industrial routes===
In industry, chloroform is produced by heating a mixture of [[chlorine]] and either [[methyl chloride|chloromethane]] or [[methane]].<ref name=Ullmann/> At 400–500 °C, a [[free radical halogenation]] occurs, converting these precursors to progressively more chlorinated compounds:
:CH<sub>4</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>Cl + [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]]
:CH<sub>3</sub>Cl + Cl<sub>2</sub> → [[Dichloromethane|CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]] + HCl
:CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> → CHCl<sub>3</sub> + HCl

Chloroform undergoes further chlorination to yield [[carbon tetrachloride]] (CCl<sub>4</sub>):
:CHCl<sub>3</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> → CCl<sub>4</sub> + HCl

The output of this process is a mixture of the four chloromethanes ([[chloromethane]], [[dichloromethane]], chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride), which can then be separated by [[distillation]].<ref name=Ullmann/>

===Deuterochloroform===
{{Main|Deuterated chloroform}}
[[Deuterated chloroform]] is an [[isotopologue]] of chloroform with a single [[deuterium]] atom. CDCl<sub>3</sub> is a common solvent used in [[NMR Spectroscopy]]. Deuterochloroform is produced by the [[haloform reaction]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}, the reaction of  acetone (or ethanol) with [[sodium hypochlorite]] or calcium hypochlorite.<ref name=Ullmann/> The haloform process is now obsolete for the production of ordinary chloroform. Deuterochloroform can also be prepared by the reaction of sodium deuteroxide with [[chloral hydrate]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} or from ordinary chloroform.<ref>Koch, Hans A. [http://patents.ic.gc.ca/cipo/cpd/en/patent/1085423/summary.html Cholorofom Deuteration Process]. Canadian Patent 1085423. Patents.ic.gc.ca. Issued: 1980-09-09. Retrieved on 2012-08-13.</ref>

===Inadvertent formation of chloroform===
The haloform reaction can also occur inadvertently in domestic settings.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Sodium hypochlorite solution ([[chlorine bleach]]) mixed with common household liquids such as [[acetone]], [[butanone]], [[ethanol]], or [[isopropyl alcohol]] can produce some chloroform, in addition to other compounds such as [[chloroacetone]] or [[dichloroacetone]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Uses==
The major use of chloroform today is in the production of the [[chlorodifluoromethane]], a major precursor to [[tetrafluoroethylene]]:
:CHCl<sub>3</sub> + 2 HF → CHClF<sub>2</sub> + 2 HCl
The reaction is conducted in the presence of a catalytic amount of [[antimony pentafluoride]]. Chlorodifluoromethane is then converted into tetrafluoroethylene, the main precursor to [[Teflon]]. Before the [[Montreal Protocol]], chlorodifluoromethane (designated as R-22) was also a popular refrigerant.

===As a solvent===
Chloroform is a common [[solvent]] in the laboratory because it is relatively unreactive, miscible with most organic liquids, and conveniently volatile.<ref>Perrin, D. D. and Armarego, W. L. F., Purification of Laboratory Chemicals, Pergamon Press: Oxford, 2009. ISBN 1856175677.</ref> Chloroform is used as a solvent in the [[pharmaceutical]] industry and for producing [[dye]]s and [[pesticide]]s. Chloroform is an effective solvent for [[alkaloid]]s in their base form and thus plant material is commonly extracted with chloroform for pharmaceutical processing. For example, it is used in commerce to extract [[morphine]] from [[poppy|poppies]] and [[scopolamine]] from ''[[Datura]]'' plants.

It can be used to bond pieces of [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic glass]] (also known under the trade names Perspex and Plexiglas). 

A solvent of phenol, chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol in a 25:24:1 ratio is used to dissolve non-nucleic acid biomolecules in DNA and RNA extractions.

Chloroform containing [[deuterium]] (heavy hydrogen), [[CDCl3|CDCl<sub>3</sub>]], is a common solvent used in [[NMR spectroscopy]].

Chloroform exhibits some chemical interaction with polypropylene. Longer term (multi-hour) storage of chloroform in polypropylene containers is not advised.<ref>"Chemical Resistance of Polypropylene", http://www.borealisgroup.com/pdf/chemical-resistance/chemtab_PP.pdf</ref>

===As a reagent in organic synthesis===
As a [[reagent]], chloroform serves as a source of the dichlorocarbene CCl<sub>2</sub> group.<ref>Srebnik, M.; Laloë, E. "Chloroform" Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis" 2001 John Wiley.{{doi|10.1002/047084289X.rc105}}</ref> It reacts with aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] usually in the presence of a [[phase transfer catalyst]] to produce [[dichlorocarbene]], CCl<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{OrgSynth|Vogel, E.; Klug, W.; Breuer.

P.|title = Phase-Transfer Hofmann Carbylamine Reaction: tert-Butyl Isocyanide|collvol = 6|collvolpages = 232|year = 1988|prep = cv6p0232}}</ref> This reagent affects ortho-formylation of activated [[aromatic rings]] such as [[phenols]], producing aryl [[aldehyde]]s in a reaction known as the [[Reimer-Tiemann reaction]]. Alternatively the [[carbene]] can be trapped by an [[alkene]] to form a [[cyclopropane]] derivative. In the [[Kharasch addition]] chloroform forms the CHCl<sub>2</sub> free radical in addition to alkenes.

===As an anesthetic===

[[File:Chickamauga 2009, Chloroform.jpg|thumb|Antique bottles of chloroform]]

Chloroform was once a widely used [[anesthesia|anesthetic]].  Its vapor depresses the [[central nervous system]] of a patient, allowing a doctor to perform various otherwise painful procedures. On 4 November 1847, the Scottish [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] [[James Young Simpson]] discovered the anaethestic qualities of chloroform when he and his friends were experimenting with different substances on themselves in search of a replacement for [[Diethyl ether|ether]] as a [[general anaesthesia|general anesthetic]]. He was so astounded by the success of his own trial that the next morning he hired a chemist and within the next few days was administering it to his patients during [[childbirth]].<ref name="Gordon2002">{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=H. Laing|title=Sir James Young Simpson and Chloroform (1811–1870)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pYer05UwKBYC&pg=PA106|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=2002-11|publisher=The Minerva Group, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4102-0291-8|pages=106–109}}</ref> The use of chloroform during [[surgery]] expanded rapidly thereafter in Europe. In the 1850s, chloroform was used during the birth of Queen Victoria's last two children.<ref>[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/victoria.html Anesthesia and Queen Victoria]. Ph.ucla.edu. Retrieved on 2012-08-13.</ref> In the United States, chloroform began to replace ether as an anesthetic at the beginning of the 20th century; however, it was quickly abandoned in favor of ether upon discovery of its toxicity, especially its tendency to cause fatal [[cardiac arrhythmia]] analogous to what is now termed "[[Solvent abuse#"Sudden sniffing death"|sudden sniffer's death]]". Some people used chloroform as a recreational drug or to commit suicide.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Martin, William|title=A Case of Chloroform Poisoning; Recovery|journal=Br Med J|date=July 3, 1886|volume=2|issue=1331|pages=16–17|pmc=2257365}}</ref> One possible mechanism of action for chloroform is that it increases movement of potassium ions through certain types of [[potassium channels]] in [[nerve cells]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1 = Patel|first1 = Amanda J.|last2 = Honoré|first2 = Eric|last3 = Lesage|first3 = Florian|last4 = Fink|first4 = Michel|last5 = Romey|first5 = Georges|last6 = Lazdunski|first6 = Michel|publication-date =|date = May 1999|title = Inhalational anesthetics activate two-pore-domain background K+ channels|journal = Nature Neuroscience|volume = 2|pages = 422–426|doi = 10.1038/8084|pmid = 10321245|issue = 5|author2 = Honoré|author3 = Lesage|author4 = Fink|author5 = Romey|author6 = Lazdunski}}</ref> Chloroform could also be mixed with other anaesthetic agents such as ether to make C.E. mixture, or ether and [[Ethanol|alcohol]] to make [[A.C.E. mixture]].

In 1848, Hannah Greener, a 15 year old girl who was having an infected toenail removed, died after being given the anesthetic.<ref>[http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/Fulltext/2002/05000/An_Unexplained_Death__Hannah_Greener_and.30.aspx An Unexplained Death: Hannah Greener and Chloroform]</ref> A number of physically fit patients died after inhaling it. However, in 1848 [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] developed an inhaler that regulated the dosage and so successfully reduced the number of deaths.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Chloroform has been used by criminals to knock out, daze or even murder their victims. Joseph Harris was charged with using chloroform in 1894 to rob people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ec1VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sEANAAAAIBAJ&pg=2904,2720400&dq=chloroform+knockout&hl=en|title=Knock-out and Chloroform|publisher=The Philadelphia record|date=9 February 1894|accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref> In 1901, Chloroform was also used to murder the American businessman [[William Marsh Rice]], the namesake of the institution now known as [[Rice University]].

===As a working fluid in a heat engine===
At least one experimental [[heat engine]] has been constructed using chloroform as a [[working fluid]] in place of [[steam]]; similar experiments had been conducted using [[diethyl ether|ether]] as a low-boiling-point working fluid, but its highly flammable nature caused difficulties, so chloroform was tried as a non-flammable alternative. Such experiments were apparently inspired by the misconception that a fluid with a lower boiling point than [[water]], being easier to vaporise, would allow the construction of a more efficient engine; in fact the reverse is the case,<ref name="carnot">{{cite web|url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/POWER/thermo/thermo.htm#ce|title=Carnot efficiency|accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> but this was not widely appreciated in the days when [[thermodynamics]] was a young science. Grandiose claims for the efficiency of this engine were reported in [[Scientific American]] in 1848, along with an editorial comment casting grave doubts on them; it appears that the development of the invention did not proceed further.<ref name="engines">{{cite web|url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/POWER/ether/ether.htm|title=Ether and Chloroform Engines|accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>

==Safety==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
A fatal oral dose of chloroform may be as small as 10 mL (14.8 g), with death due to respiratory or cardiac arrest.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/hlthef/chlorofo.html Chloroform], US Environmental Potection Agency</ref>

As might be expected for an [[general anaesthetic|anesthetic]], chloroform vapors depress the [[central nervous system]]. It is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]] at approximately 500 [[parts per million|ppm]], according to the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]. Breathing about 900 ppm for a short time can cause dizziness, fatigue, and headache. Chronic chloroform exposure can damage the [[liver]] (where chloroform is metabolized to [[phosgene]]) and the [[kidney]]s, and some people develop sores when the skin is immersed in chloroform.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[Animal study|Animal studies]] have shown that [[miscarriage]]s occur in [[rat]]s and [[mouse|mice]] that have breathed [[air]] containing 30 to 300 [[part per million|ppm]] of chloroform during [[pregnancy]] and also in rats that have ingested chloroform during pregnancy. [[Offspring]] of rats and mice that breathed chloroform during pregnancy have a higher incidence of [[birth defect]]s, and abnormal [[spermatozoon|sperm]] have been found in male mice that have breathed air containing 400 ppm chloroform for a few days. The effect of chloroform on [[reproduction]] in humans is unknown.

Chloroform once appeared in [[toothpaste]]s, [[cough syrup]]s, [[ointment]]s, and other [[pharmaceutical]]s, but it has been banned as a [[consumer product]] in the US since 1976.<ref>{{cite web| title= The National Toxicology Program: Substance Profiles: Chloroform CAS No. 67-66-3| url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/profiles/Chloroform.pdf | format=PDF| accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref> Cough syrups containing chloroform can still be legally purchased in pharmacies and supermarkets in the UK.

The US National Toxicology Program's twelfth report on carcinogens<ref>{{cite web| title= Substances Listed in the Twelfth Report on Carcinogens| url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/ListedSubstancesReasonablyAnticipated.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref> implicates it as reasonably anticipated to be a human [[carcinogen]], a designation equivalent to [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] class 2A.  The IARC itself classifies chloroform as ''possibly carcinogenic to humans'', a Group 2B designation.<ref>{{cite web| title= International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) – Summaries & Evaluations: Chloroform| url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol73/73-05.html| accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>  It has been most readily associated with [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/1970/78127_9.html | title=Current Intelligence Bulletin 9: Chloroform (DDM)|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cdc.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title= National Toxicology Program: Report on the carcinogenesis bioassay of chloroform|url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/LT_rpts/trChloroform.pdf}}</ref> Caution is mandated during its handling in order to minimize unnecessary exposure; safer alternatives, such as [[dichloromethane]], have resulted in a substantial reduction of its use as a solvent.

===Conversion to phosgene===
During prolonged storage in the presence of [[oxygen]], chloroform converts slowly to [[phosgene]]. To prevent accidents, commercial chloroform is stabilized with [[ethanol]] or [[pentene|amylene]], but samples that have been recovered or dried no longer contain any stabilizer. Amylene has been found ineffective, and the phosgene can affect analytes in samples, lipids, and nucleic acids dissolved in or extracted with chloroform.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/safety/19980302.html|author=Turk, Eric|title=Phosgene from Chloroform|journal= Chemical & Engineering News |date=2 March 1998|volume=76|issue=9|page=6}}</ref>  Dissolved phosgene cannot be removed by distillation or carbon filters, but it is removed by [[calcium hydroxide]] or [[activated alumina]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=6130900|year=1982|last1=Cone|first1=EJ|last2=Buchwald|first2=WF|last3=Darwin|first3=WD|title=Analytical controls in drug metabolic studies. II. Artifact formation during chloroform extraction of drugs and metabolites with amine substituents|volume=10|issue=6|pages=561–7|journal=Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals}}</ref>

Suspected samples can be tested for phosgene using filter paper (treated with 5% [[diphenylamine]], 5% [[dimethylaminobenzaldehyde]] in alcohol, and then dried), which turns yellow in phosgene vapor. There are several colorimetric and fluorometric reagents for phosgene, and it can also be quantified with [[mass spectrometry]].
