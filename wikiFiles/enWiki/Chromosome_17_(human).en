'''Chromosome 17''' is one of the 23 pairs of [[chromosome]]s in [[human]]s. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 17 spans more than 81 million [[base pair]]s (the building material of [[DNA]]) and represents between 2.5 and 3% of the total DNA in [[cell (biology)|cells]].

Identifying [[gene]]s on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 17 likely contains between 1,200 and 1,500 genes.  It also contains the [[Homeobox]] B gene cluster.
