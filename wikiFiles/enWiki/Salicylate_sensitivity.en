'''Salicylate sensitivity''', also known as '''salicylate intolerance''', is any [[adverse effect]] that occurs when a normal amount of [[salicylic acid|salicylate]] is introduced into a person's body.  People with salicylate intolerance are unable to consume a normal amount of salicylate without [[adverse effect]]s.  

Salicylate sensitivity differs from '''salicylism''', which occurs when an individual takes an [[overdose]] of salicylates.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000094208|salicylism}}</ref>  Salicylate overdose can occur in people without salicylate sensitivity, and can be deadly if untreated. For more information, see [[aspirin poisoning]]. 

Salicylates are derivatives of salicylic acid that occur naturally in [[plant]]s and serve as a natural [[immune]] hormone and [[preservative]], protecting the plants against [[disease]]s, [[insects]], [[fungi]], and harmful [[bacteria]]. Salicylates can also be found in many [[medication]]s, [[perfume]]s and preservatives. Both natural and synthetic salicylates can cause health problems in anyone when consumed in large doses. But for those who are salicylate intolerant, even small doses of salicylate can cause adverse reactions.

==Terminology==
Depending on whether the salicylate is a component of food or medicine, salicylate intolerance is a form of [[food intolerance]] or of [[drug intolerance]]. 

Salicylate sensitivity is a [[pharmacological]] reaction, not a true [[IgE]]-mediated [[allergy]].  However, it is possible for aspirin to trigger non-allergic hypersensitivity reactions.<ref name="pmid18834360">

== History ==
An important salicylate drug is [[aspirin]], which has a long history.  Aspirin intolerance was widely known by 1975, when the understanding began to emerge that it is a [[pharmacological]] reaction, not an allergy.<ref name="pmid1199905">{{cite journal

== Symptoms ==
The most common symptoms of salicylate sensitivity are:{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

* Itchy skin, [[hives]] or [[rash]]es
* [[Stomach]] pain/upset stomach
* [[Asthma]] and other breathing difficulties
* [[Angioedema]]
* [[Headache]]s
* Swelling of [[hand]]s, feet, eyelids, [[face]] and/or lips
* Bed wetting or urgency to pass water
* Persistent [[cough]]
* Changes in skin color/skin discoloration
* [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]]
* Sore, itchy, puffy or burning eyes
* [[Sinusitis]]/[[Nasal polyps]]
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Nausea]]
* [[Hyperactivity]]
* [[Memory loss]] and poor concentration
* [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]
* [[Pseudoanaphylaxis]]

== Diagnosis ==

There are no laboratory or [[Skin allergy test|skin testing]] methods for testing salicylate sensitivity.  Provocative challenge is one method of obtaining reliable diagnosis. Provocative challenge is intended to induce a controlled reaction as a means of confirming diagnosis. During provocative challenge, the person is given incrementally higher doses of salicylates, usually aspirin, under medical supervision, until either symptoms appear or the likelihood of symptoms appearing is ruled out.  

== Treatment ==

Completely eliminating salicylate from one’s diet and environment is virtually impossible and is not a recommended course of action by many immunologists.{{fact|date=October 2009}}  The range of foods that have no salicylate content is very limited, and consequently salicylate-free diets are very restricted.

[[Desensitization (medicine)|Desensitization]] involves daily consumption of small doses of salicylate without symptoms recurring and slowly increasing the dosage.

[[Montelukast]] is one form of treatment used in aspirin-intolerant asthma.<ref name="pmid17924829">
