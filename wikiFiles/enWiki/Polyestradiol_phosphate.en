'''Polyestradiol phosphate''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], trade name '''Estradurin''') is an [[estrogen]] in form of a [[polymer]]<ref name="pmid10861754" /> used for the [[palliative]] treatment of [[prostate cancer]].<ref name="pmid17219379" /><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> The drug has been marketed since 1960 by [[Pfizer]] in a number of European countries.<ref name="SPC danish" /><ref name="Drugs.com" />

==Medical use==
Polyestradiol phosphate is used as an [[intramuscular]] injection for [[estrogen therapy (oncology)|estrogen therapy]] of prostate cancer. It is available in combination with [[mepivacaine]], a [[local anaesthetic]], to avoid a burning sensation during application. After injection, it releases the active agent [[estradiol]] over several weeks.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Pharmacokinetics==
Polyestradiol phosphate reaches the bloodstream within hours after the injection (90% after 24 hours), and is accumulated in the [[reticuloendothelial system]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> Estradiol is then cleaved from the polymer by [[phosphatase]]s, although slowly because polyestradiol phosphate acts as a phosphatase [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid13151143" /> With monthly injections, stable estradiol concentrations are reached after six to twelve months.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> Estradiol is metabolized primarily in the liver by [[CYP3A4]] and other [[cytochrome]] enzymes, and to a lesser extent in the kidneys, [[testicle]]s and muscles.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /> The metabolites are mainly excreted via the kidneys.

==Mechanism of action==
The growth of prostate cancer is generally stimulated by [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT); and unless the cancer is [[Castration-resistant prostate cancer|castration resistant]], it can be treated by depriving it of DHT. Estradiol inhibits the action of DHT by several mechanisms. Firstly, it acts over the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis]] feedback loop by blocking secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]], which reduces [[testosterone]] synthesis in [[Leydig cell]]s in the testicle. It blocks testosterone uptake into [[prostate]] cells, where it would be metabolized to DHT by the enzyme [[5α-reductase]]. Estradiol also inhibits 5α-reductase directly, blocks binding of DHT to [[androgen receptors]], and exhibits [[cytotoxicity]] on prostate cancer cells.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /><ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Contraindications==
The drug has the same contraindications as other forms of estradiol, including active [[thromboembolism]] (such as [[myocardial infarction]]) or high risk for thromboembolic events, [[asthma]], and severe [[hepatic impairment]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /><ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Adverse effects==
Although systematic studies of the drug's adverse effects are missing, it is assumed that they are identical to the effects observed under therapy with estradiol and other estrogens. These include nausea, headache, sodium and [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]], gain (but sometimes loss) of body weight, [[impaired glucose tolerance]], and [[mood swing]]s (in 40% of patients). [[Allergic reaction]]s of the skin include itching, [[erythema multiforme]] and, rarely, [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> As thromboembolic complications are associated mainly with [[Oral administration|oral]] estrogens and attributed to the [[first-pass effect]], they are expected to occur less frequently under [[parenteral]] therapies such as polyestradiol phosphate.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

Overdose typically manifests itself by reversible [[feminization (biology)|feminization]].<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Interactions==
Estradiol levels may be increased by CYP3A4 inhibitors such as [[erythromycin]], [[clarithromycin]], [[ketoconazole]], [[itraconazole]] and [[grapefruit juice]], and lowered by CYP3A4 [[Enzyme inducer|inducers]] such as [[St John's wort]], [[barbiturate]]s, [[carbamazepine]] and [[rifampicin]]. The combination with [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s can increase the risk for thromboembolism. Estradiol can also increase the effects of [[glucocorticoid]]s.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Arzneimittel-Interaktionen" />

==Physical and chemical properties==
===Solubility===
Polyestradiol phosphate is of very low solubility in water, [[acetone]], [[chloroform]], [[dioxane]], and [[ethanol]], but solves readily in [[base (chemistry)|base]]s, especially in aqueous [[pyridine]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

===Synthesis===
Like polyphosphates of [[polyphenols]], polyestradiol phosphate can be prepared from the [[monomer]] (in this case estradiol) and [[phosphoryl chloride]]. The latter reacts with both the phenolic [[hydroxyl]] group in position 3 and the [[aliphatic]] one in position 17. The [[molecular mass]] of the resulting polymer can be controlled by interrupting the reaction after a given time: the longer the reaction is allowed to continue, the higher the mass.<ref name="pmid13151143" /><ref name="synthesis" />

==History==
Pharmacological experiments on estradiol phosphates conducted around 1950 gave rise to the hypothesis that estradiol 3,17-diphosphate acted as an inhibitor of kidney [[alkaline phosphatase]].<ref name="pmid13151143" /> When the same scientists wanted to synthesize simple phosphates of [[phloretin]], a compound found in apple tree leaves,<ref name="Picinelli" /> they accidentally created a polymer instead.<ref name="synthesis" /> This was later shown to exhibit the same anti-phosphatase properties as estradiol diphosphate, and so it was hypothesized that the original finding was due to contamination with estradiol phosphate polymers.<ref name="pmid13151143" /> Consequently, these polymers were studied in more detail, which resulted in marketing of polyestradiol phosphate in 1960.<ref name="SPC danish" /> This drug is or has been marketed by Pfizer in Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Norway, and Sweden.<ref name="Drugs.com" /> As of 2012, it is no longer available in Austria.{{Citation needed|date = May 2012}}
