As of 2009, 2600 former [[leprosy]] patients were living in 13 national sanatoriums and two private hospitals in [[Japan]]. Their mean age is 80. There were no newly diagnosed Japanese leprosy patients in 2005, but one in 2006, and one in 2007.

==History==

=== Ancient and Medieval Ages ===
*The route of leprosy into Japan has not been settled but the presence of '''leprosy in Japan''' at least in the Nara Era (710-784)<ref>http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~libell/34-rekisi.htm#3</ref> and the earliest record of leprosy in Korea at Cheju Island  in 1445 suggests that leprosy came from the south.<ref>Lew J A Korean Model for the Healing of Leprosy, 1971</ref>
*In a collection of government documents titled "Ryounogige", written in 833, leprosy was described as the following: "It is caused by a parasite which eats five organs of the body. The eyebrows and eyelashes come off, and the nose is deformed. The disease brings hoarseness, and necessitates amputations of the fingers and toes.  Do not sleep with the patients, as the disease is transmittable to those nearby."<ref>Kikuchi I  Hansen's disease in Japan: a brief history Int J Dermatol 1997:36, 629-633.</ref>
**This is the first document in the world that identifies leprosy as transmissible, since there had been no such documents in China.
**[[Kensuke Mitsuda]] thought that this was because of the frequent complication of scabies with leprosy, since scabies is easily transmitted.<ref>Mitsuda K  Coexistence of leprosy and scabies  Nihonkoushuuhokenkyoukai Zasshi 10:11, 1934</ref>
*According to a [[legend]], [[Empress Komyo]] washed a leprosy patient in the 8th century.
*In medieval times, people with leprosy were discriminated against and lived separately from the main dwelling areas of the villages. This discrimination was bolstered by religion -one of the sutras of the Nichiren sect stated that "those who do not respect this sutra will get leprosy in the next stage of life."
*During the short period (1549–1611) when Catholic priests were allowed to preach Christianity, they built special hospitals where they treated leprosy patients. But this came to an end when the Tokugawa Government enacted the death penalty for the crime of being a Catholic.
*[[Otani Yoshitsugu]] a famous samurai of the sengoku era also suffered from Leprosy. It was said to be one of the factors that led to his defeat at the battle of [[Sekigahara]]

=== The Meiji Era (1868-1912) ===
*Japan reopened its doors to foreign countries in 1868, and the power went to the Emperor and the democratic government.  Checkpoints between provinces were abolished in 1871, and leprosy patients could also freely travel in the country.
*In the same year, leprosy patients began to line up on the road to Honmyoji, a noted temple in Kumamoto, Kyushu, Japan, for mercy.<ref>Kikuchi I Hansen's disease patients: responses to stigma and segreation in Kumamoto, Japan  Int J Dermatol 1994:33:142-145</ref> The first national survey conducted in 1904 indicated that there were 30,359 patients, but because of the methodology, this figure may be vastly underestimated.

=== Christian missionaries and Japanese savers ===
*Japanese people were accustomed to seeing people with leprosy begging for money at temples and shrines or wherever people gathered, but this was a shocking event to Europeans.  Upon seeing a miserable 30-year-old woman abandoned near a watermill, Father Testevuide became determined to establish a facility for such people. In 1889, he started the Kohyama Fukusei Hospital. His example was followed by [[Kate Youngman]] in Tokyo, Miss Hannah Riddell and Father Corre in Kumamoto.
*In 1875, Dr. Masafumi Goto founded the Kihai Hospital in Tokyo which was specially designed to treat leprosy patients.  Dr. Goto and his son, Dr. Masanao Goto, became widely known for their balneotherapy for leprosy patients. At the request of the King of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Dr. Masasao Goto visited Hawaii and introduced their method. Most of Japanese doctors who established these facilities discontinued their activities after the start of public leprosy sanatoriums.

=== The 1905 epoch-making meeting ===
*[[Hannah Riddell]] established the Kaishun Hospital in 1895 in Kumamoto and her activities are mentioned elsewhere.
{{main|Hannah Riddell}}
*Because of the Russo-Japanese war, she was in desperate financial straights because English people stopped sending money to her because of the risks that could occur during the sending process. An important meeting was held at the Banker's club in Tokyo, both to save her and to discuss leprosy problems facing Japan. Various leaders, including those representing the Government, statesmen, and journalists, attended the meeting.
*The timing was good. The Japanese Government had begun to take an interest in leprosy problems since they found many patients in the drafts for military service. To become strong militarily was their biggest concern at the time. The meeting was chaired by Viscount Shibuzawa, who was a leading businessman . At the meeting [[Kensuke Mitsuda]] stressed that leprosy was infectious.
*Finally the Japanese Government, spurred by the events of the 1905 meeting, promulgated the first leprosy prevention law in 1907 and started five public sanatoriums in 1909.

=== "No Leprosy Patients in Prefecture" Movement ===
*At the start of public sanatoriums, only the wandering patients were hospitalized. However,as time went, people wanted their prefectures to be "purified," and the belief began that there should be no leprosy patients in their prefectures.
*This started around 1930 and it is called the No Leprosy Patients in Our Prefecture Movement. This movement naturally worsened [[leprosy stigma]].  In Kumamoto, 157 patients living near Honmyoji were "arrested" and transferred to other sanatoriums. A patient received unjust procedures and was sentenced to death penalty.
*{{further|Forced Hospitalization at Honmyoji}}

=== War and Leprosy ===
*In Japanese sanatoriums, in 1945, because of food shortage, many patients died of tuberculosis in mainland Japan with a rate of 20% at the worst leperosaria. In Okinawa, more than 25% of patients died in the sanatoriurm in the same year. In the Miyako Nanseien, Okinawa, the death rate was over 40% in 1945 and the cause of death was almost malaria. It was reported that in a psychiatric hospital in Tokyo (Tokyo Metropolitan Matsuzawa Byoin), the death rate in 1945 was 40% <ref>Okada Y  The death rate of prewar day Tokyo Psychiatric Hospitals: in Kindai Shomin Seikatsushi, 5, Byouki, Eisei, San-Ichi Shobyou, 1995</ref>

====*The rate of death of in-patients at 10 national sanatoriums====
*In 1945 and 1946, excluding [[Suruga Sanatorium]]
*In other years, including all sanatoriums. [[Amami Wakoen Sanatorium]], [[Okinawa Airakuen Sanatorium]] and [[Miyako Nanseien Sanatorium]] are excluded.

=== The 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law and Patients' Struggle===
*[[Kensuke Mitsuda]] stated before the Upper House in 1951 that all patients be hospitalized. This was a segregation policy and all patients were against it.  Some of them staged even hunger strikes, but the 1953 leprosy prevention law was passed; there were practically no changes from the strict 1931 leprosy prevention law.

=== The expressed view of the Japan Leprosy Association===
*Hiroshi Shima, Fujio Otani, Minoru Narita and Kunio Murakami were great in the abolishment of the Japan's Leprosy Prevention Law. It was delayed because the opinions of patient automony associations differed.

==== The statement of the Japanese Leprosy Association on the Leprosy Prevention Law ====
*It is said that the leprosy control method in Japan was greatly influenced by the First International Congress of Leprosy in 1897, at which it was concluded that isolation of patients was the best method of leprosy control. However, this did not mean indiscriminate isolation of patients.  The Interior Ministry of Japan replied to a question that "the salvation of wandering patients" be given priority, above that of prevention. Absolute isolation has been based on two views; 1) that leprosy occurs through intimate contact within the families in which any patients would be the source of infection, and 2) leprosy would be incurable for the rest of life.  Absolute isolation was supported by the social belief of that day; leprosy is a shameful disease and the purity (absence of leprosy patients) of the nation should be maintained, thus justifying isolation. Complete isolation was given priority rather than salvation of patients.
*In Japan, not a small number of patients had been found during the draft for military service. Between 1897 and 1937, leprosy patients found at the draft kept decreasing.  There were major national censuses between 1919 and 1935, during which the number of leprosy patients kept decreasing. Epidemiologically speaking, improvement in the living conditions has been given credit for this decrease, rather than the results of isolation. Japan was on its way to elimination of leprosy patients, irrespective of enforced isolation. In other words, statistically speaking, the present leprosy prevention law had not been necessary.
*Nevertheless, the 1953 revision of the leprosy prevention law was passed and enforced.  At that time, the effects of chemotherapy were apparent, and internationally, isolation has not been supported at the Rome Conference on rehabilitation.  Dapsone and rifampicin were put into service.  In 1982, the infectivity of Mycobacterium leprae was found to disappear within several doses of rifampicin, and a multidrug therapeutic regimen(MDT) was proposed. This has become the standard regimen for leprosy control. Recently new quinolones were added.
*Outpatient treatment has become possible even at the onset of the disease, and now we can treat patients with erythema nodosum leprosum and leprous neuritis without much difficulty.
*Although there have been mysteries left unsolved concerning leprosy, such as the mode of transmission or the relationship between infection and development of symptoms, there have been no reports suggesting leprosy is the beyond the concept of ordinary infections.
*Therefore, the present law lost its basis for existence; medically speaking, the law deserved to be abrogated.
*As late as 1955, 91 percent of leprosy patients were hospitalized in leprosaria. Outpatient treatment did become popular, but management of patients continued to be leprosarium-centered.  This does not go hand in hand with WHO, which aims at the coexistence of patients and society.  Therefore, we have been left far from the remainder of the world. *It cannot be denied that the isolation within the leprosaria has made those working at hospitals and universities lose interest in the treatment of leprosy.  The Japanese Leprosy Association deeply reflected on these matters.  However, they did not lead toward an abrogatin of the outdated law, they did not point out this failure of leprosy control, because those working in leprosaria occupied the central part of the association, and they let the law to exist to the present time.
*New leprosy patients should be treated on an outpatient basis, within the framework of the health insurance system.  Hansen's disease centers should be established and specialists be trained.
*We have no right to condemn our senior leprologists who advocated isolation under the banner of "salvation" of the patients. However, we must listen to and hear the pitiful cries of those who have been separated from their families because of leprosy stigma.  Reflections and self-criticisms are urgently needed.
*Leprosy control should be nothing but medical control.  It was our failure that we advocated isolation with a view to arousing public opinion, theirby stirring up the fear of leprosy in this country. The Japanese Leprosy Association and Japanese medical world need to reflect on this and recognize this fact again.

=== The Trials ===
*The Zenkankyo (Patients' Union) staged a number of struggles against the Ministry of Welfare and they finally won the abolishment of the 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law in 1996. It was ruled that the law was unconstitutional between 1960 and 1996. During this period, the law should have not been present.<ref>Japan's leprosy prevention law to disappear  Kikuchi I The Star 54, 5, 10. 1995.</ref> In 1998, many patients sued the Government for compensation and they won it in 2001.

== Life in the Sanatoriums ==

===The present situation===
*There are about 2600 ex-patients in 13 national Hansen's disease sanatoriums and 2 private hospitals as of May 1, 2009. There are no active leprosy patients, and all are recovered or have after-effects of leprosy. Their mean age is 80. Because of sterilization and abortion, they do not have children. Many of them have disease of advanced ages or handicaps and aids are necessary. Some earnestly hope for social rehabilitation, but there are a very few who are active in society.
*Those in the sanatoriums enjoy life in or out of the sanatoriums; medical and living care are helped by doctors and health workers. Their families visit them in sanatoriums and vice versa. They may be treated in other medical facilities, if necessary.

=== Religions ===
*Every leprosy sanatorium in Japan has churches and Buddhist temples (there are no temples attached to sanatoria in Okinawa Prefecture), and it is true that patients had faith, though some patients stated that deciding on a religion was in preparation for their death in the leprosaria. In days gone by, they could not share the family graves, an instance of [[leprosy stigma]].  In Kikuchi Keifuen Leprosarium, statistics showed Buddhism A 757, B 85, C 89, D (Sokagakkai) 51, Shintoism A 11, Shintoism B 9, Catholic 51, Christianity 95, as of 1979.

=== Abortions and sterilization ===
*Since 1915, sterilization had been performed in public sanatoriums in Japan, since it was hard to bring up the babies born of patients in sanatoriums. Married life was permitted. Abortions were also performed. Because of this custom, patients did not have children.
*The Leprosy Prevention laws of 1907, 1931 and 1953, the last one only repealed in 1996, permitted the segregation of patients in sanitariums where forced abortions and sterilization were common, (even if the laws did not refer to it), and authorized punishment of patients "disturbing peace".
{{further|Eugenics in Japan}}

=== Recreations ===
*Hospitalized patients in prewar days were comparatively young, and they enjoyed sports and other kinds of recreations.

=== Literature ===
*Some patients wrote novels, and many patients composed Tanka and Haiku, a short poem.

=== Education ===
*Education in prewar days was unsatisfactory. Educated patients taught patients who needed education. In postwar days, branch schools of primary schools and secondary schools were made within the leprosariums. A high school was made for some time starting in 1955; 369 patients were enrolled and 307 patients graduated from the school.
*Education of children born of patients was insufficient. In Kumamoto, the enrollment of them into a primary school met social stigma or [[leprosy stigma]] in 1954 which was called the Tatsudaryo Incident or Kurokamikou Incident.

== Leprosy Stigma ==
{{main|leprosy stigma}}
*Leprosy in Japan is characterized by considerable [[leprosy stigma]], by the Buddhistic concept of leprosy that leprosy is punishment and in modern times by three leprosy prevention laws requesting segregation.

== Personalities ==
'''Empress Teimei'''
*[[Empress Teimei]] (貞明皇后, Teimei Kōgō, 25 June 1884 – 17 May 1951), also known as Empress Dowager Teimei (貞明皇太后, Teimei-kōtaigō), was empress consort of Emperor Taishō of Japan. She was the mother of [[Emperor Shōwa]]. Her posthumous name, Teimei, means "enlightened constancy". She was interested in leprosy problems and donated money to [[Hannah Riddell]] in financial distress since 1915, and other foreigners. She donated money with which a leprosy prevention foundation was established in 1931 and left money upon her death which became the basis of the Tofu Organization for Leprosy, in 1951.

After retiring from the Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium (Kyushu Sanatorium), he established a leprosy facility in India. He died in an airplane accident in India.
*{{main|Matsuki Miyazaki}}
'''Isamu Masuda'''
*[[Isamu Masuda]](1872–1945) was a Japanese doctor, known for writing "Leprosy and Social Problems" in 1907, the year of the promulgation of the first leprosy law, and openly criticized the crucial segregation policy. He advocated the nation's involvement in the discovery of treatments of leprosy, since he believed that it was curable.
*{{main|Isamu Masuda}}
'''Masako Ogawa'''
*[[Masako Ogawa]] (1902–1943) was a female Japanese doctor who worked at the Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium. She wrote a book, "Spring in a small island" in 1938, about her experiences in persuading leprosy patients in remote areas of Japan into hospitalization. It created a sensation in Japan, and was made into a film. On the other hand, she was criticized for accelerating the "No leprosy patients in prefecture" movement and giving an impression that leprosy is to be feared.
*{{main|Masako Ogawa}}
'''Masasue Suho'''
*[[Masasue Suho]] (October 8, 1885-June 20, 1942) was a Japanese physician, the director of the Sorok Island Sanatorium in Korea. He completed the world's biggest leprosy facility Sorok Island Sanatorium hospitalizing 6000 patients. He was assassinated by a patient while rushing to a morning ceremony. Forced segregation of leprosy patients, the worsening of treatment of patients and antipathy against colonial rule were behind the assassination.
