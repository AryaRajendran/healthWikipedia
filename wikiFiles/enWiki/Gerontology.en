'''Gerontology''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:γέρων|γέρων]], ''geron'', "old man" and -λογία, ''[[-logy]]'', "study of"; coined by [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]] in 1903) is the study of the [[social]], [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[Biology|biological]] aspects of [[Ageing|aging]]. It is distinguished from [[geriatrics]], which is the branch of medicine that studies the diseases of older adults. Gerontologists include researchers and practitioners in the fields of biology, medicine, nursing, dentistry, social work, physical and occupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, economics, political science, architecture, pharmacy, public health, housing and anthropology.<ref name=Hooyman>{{cite book |last1=Hooyman |first1=N.R. |last2=Kiyak |first2=H.A. |title=Social gerontology: A multidisciplinary perspective |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston |year=2011 |isbn=0205763138 |edition=9th }}</ref> 

Gerontology encompasses the following:
* studying physical, mental, and social changes in people as they age
* investigating the aging (ageing) process itself ([[biogerontology]])
* investigating the interface of normal aging and age-related disease ([[geroscience]])
* investigating the effects of an [[Population ageing|ageing population]] on society
* applying this knowledge to policies and programs, including the macroscopic (for example, government planning) and microscopic (for example, running a nursing home) perspectives.

The multidisciplinary nature of gerontology means that there are a number of subfields, as well as associated fields such as psychology and sociology that overlap with gerontology. Gerontologists view aging in terms of four distinct processes: chronological aging, biological aging, psychological aging, and social aging.<ref name=Hooyman /> Chronological aging is the definition of aging based on a person's years lived from birth.<ref name=Hooyman /> Biological aging refers to the physical changes that reduce the efficiency of organ systems.<ref name=Hooyman /> Psychological aging includes the changes that occur in sensory and perceptual processes, cognitive abilities, adaptive capacity, and personality.<ref name=Hooyman /> Social aging refers to an individual's changing roles and relationships with family, friends, and other informal supports, productive roles and within organizations.<ref name=Hooyman />

==Aging demographics==
Rapid [[aging population]]s are expected worldwide.  In 1900, there were 3.1 million people aged 65 years and older living in the [[United States]].  However, this population continued to grow throughout the 20th century and reached 31.2, 35, and 40.3 million people in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively.  Notably, in the United States, the [[Baby boomers|"baby boomer"]] generation began to turn 65 in 2011.  Recently, the population aged 65 years and older has grown at a faster rate than the total population in the United States.  The total population increased by 9.7%, from 281.4 million to 308.7 million, between 2000 and 2010.  However, the population aged 65 years and older increased by 15.1% during the same period.<ref name="census.gov">{{cite web |author=Carrie A. Werner |title=The Older Population: 2010 |year=2010 |work=2010 Census Briefs |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-09.pdf |id=C2010BR-09 |format=PDF}}</ref>  It has been estimated that 25% of the population in the United States and [[Canada]] will be aged 65 years and older by 2025.  Moreover, by 2050, it is predicted that, for the first time in United States history, the number of individuals aged 60 years and older will be greater than the number of children aged 0 to 14 years.<ref name= Taylor />  Those aged 85 years and older (oldest-old) are projected to increase from 5.3 million to 21 million by 2050.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Population |chapterurl=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/2008_Documents/Population.aspx |title=2008 Older Americans : Key indicators of Well-Being |year=2008 |url=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/Data_2008.aspx}}</ref>  Adults aged 85–89 years constituted the greatest segment of the oldest-old in 1990, 2000, and 2010.

=== Gender differences with age ===

There has been a considerable disparity between the number of men and women in the older population in the United States.  In both 2000 and 2010, women outnumbered men in the older population at every single year of age (e.g., 65 to 100 years and over).  The [[sex ratio]], which is a measure used to indicate the balance of males to females in a population, is calculated by taking the number of males divided by the number of females, and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the sex ratio is the number of males per 100 females.  In 2010, there were 90.5 males per 100 females in the 65-year-old population.  However, this represented an increase from 1990 when there were 82.7 males per 100 females, and from 2000 when the sex ratio was 88.1. Although the gender gap between men and women has narrowed, women continue to have a greater life expectancy and lower mortality rates at older ages relative to men. For example, the [[2010 United States Census|Census 2010]] reported that there were approximately twice as many women as men living in the United States at 89 years of age (361,309 versus 176,689, respectively).<ref name="census.gov"/> The age-related changes males experience is likely to progress faster than the age-related changes in which females experience.  Neural systems associated with behavioral domains identify age effects on behavior and brain parameters, which indicate more pronounced age-related changes in men than in women.<ref>{{cite web|last=Silverman LK.|first=Phillips|title=Homogeneity of effect sizes for sex across spatial tests and cultures: implications for hormonal theories.|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8790937|work=1996;31:90–94.|publisher=Brain Cogn.}}</ref> Research and studies have found strong evidence of ovarian hormones playing a key role in mediating behavior and brain function, contributing to female’s superiority in gender on cognitive and healthy aging.

===Geographic distribution of older adults===

The number and percentage of older adults living in the United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census.  In 2010, the South contained the greatest number of people aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older.  However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest percentage of adults aged 65 years and older (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the [[Census 2000]], all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010.  Likewise, in the population aged 85 years and older, the West (42.8%) also showed the fastest growth and increased from 806,000 in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2010. It is worth highlighting that [[Rhode Island]] was the only state that experienced a reduction in the number of people aged 65 years and older, and declined from 152,402 in 2000 to 151,881 in 2010.  Conversely, all states exhibited an increase in the population of adults aged 85 years and older from 2000 to 2010.<ref name="census.gov"/>

==History of gerontology==
{{Original research|date=January 2008}}

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], several physicians wrote on issues related to Gerontology. [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1025) offered instruction for the care of the aged, including [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and remedies for problems including [[constipation]].<ref name=Howell87>{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=Trevor H.|title=Avicenna and His Regimen of Old Age|journal=Age and Ageing|year=1987|volume=16|pages=58–59|doi=10.1093/ageing/16.1.58|pmid=3551552|issue=1}}</ref> Arabic physician [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]] Al-Qayrawani (Algizar, c. 898–980) wrote on the medicine and health of the elderly.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=''Vesalius'' Official journal of the International Society for the History of Medicine |year=1998 |url=http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/ishm/vesalius/VESx1998x04x01.pdf}}</ref> His scholarly work covers [[sleep disorder]]s, [[Forgetting|forgetfulness]], how to strengthen [[memory]]<ref>[http://www.medarus.org/Medecins/MedecinsTextes/al_jazzar.htm Algizar a web page in french]</ref><ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/bioI.html#jazzar Ibn Jazzar]</ref><ref>[Geritt Bos, ''Ibn al-Jazzar'', ''Risala fi l-isyan'' (Treatise on forgetfulness), London, 1995 ]</ref> and causes of [[Death|mortality]]<ref name="Al Jazzar">[http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm Al Jazzar]</ref> [[Ishaq ibn Hunayn]] (died 910) also wrote on treatments for forgetfulness.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_08.html Islamic culture and medical arts]</ref>

While the number of aged humans, and the maximum life span, tended to increase in every century since the 14th, society tended to consider caring for an elderly relative as a family issue. It was not until the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] that ideas shifted in favor of a societal care-system. Care homes for the aged emerged in the 19th century. 

Some early pioneers, such as [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], who himself lived to be 102, believed that aging itself should be a science to be studied. The word "gerontology" was coined c. 1903<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gerontology Online Etymology Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> by [[Elie Metchnikoff]].

It was not until the 1940s, however, that pioneers like [[James Birren]] began organizing gerontology into its own field. Recognizing that there were experts in many fields all dealing with the older population, it became apparent that a group like the [[Gerontological Society of America]] (founded in 1945) was needed. Two decades later, James Birren was appointed as the founding director of the first academic research center devoted exclusively to the study of aging, the [[Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center]]<ref>http://gero.usc.edu/about/ethel-percy-andrus</ref> at the [[University of Southern California]].<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/dept/gero/research.shtml USC Andrus Gerontology Center]</ref><ref name=Liebig>{{cite journal |last=Liebig |first=Phoebe S. |last2=Birren |first2=James E. |authorlink2=James Birren |title=The Andrus Center: A tale of gerontological firsts |journal=Contemporary Gerontology |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=7–12 |url=http://www-scf.usc.edu/~sga/documents/Liebig%20Birren.pdf |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The Baltimore Longitudinal Studies of Aging began in 1958 in order to study physiological changes in healthy middle-aged and older men living in the community by testing them every two years on numerous physiological parameters.<ref name=Hooyman /> In 1967, the [[University of South Florida]]<ref>http://www.usf.edu/</ref> and the [[University of North Texas]] (formerly North Texas State University) received Older Americans Act training grants from the U.S. Administration on Aging to launch the nation's first degree programs in gerontology, at the master's level. In 1975, the University of Southern California's [[Leonard Davis School of Gerontology]],<ref>http://gero.usc.edu/about/leonard-davis</ref> with Birren as its founding dean, became the country's first school of gerontology within a university and, later, offered the first PhD in Gerontology degree. Since that time, a number of other universities have formed departments or schools of gerontology or aging studies. 

More generally, gerontological education has flourished in the United States since 1967 and degrees at all academic levels are now offered by a number of colleges and universities.<ref name=Haley>{{cite journal |last=Haley |first=William E. |last2=Zelinski |first2=Elizabeth |title=Progress and challenges in graduate education in gerontology: The U.S. experience |journal=Gerontology & Geriatrics Education |volume=27 |issue=3 |year=2007 |pages=11–26 |doi=10.1300/J021v27n03_02}}</ref> Several university-based centers on aging have been founded such as the Duke University Center on Aging, the University of Georgia Institute of Gerontology, the Center of Aging at the [[University of Chicago]],<ref>http://www.spc.uchicago.edu/coa/</ref> and the Stanford Center on Longevity.<ref name=Hooyman /> Relatively few universities offer a [[PhD]] in gerontology.  Currently, PhD programs in gerontology are available at [[Miami University]],<ref>http://scripps.muohio.edu/content/phd-social-gerontology</ref> the [[University of Kansas]],<ref>http://www2.ku.edu/~kugeron/program/phd.shtml</ref> [[University of Kentucky]],<ref>http://www.mc.uky.edu/gerontology/programs.html</ref> [[University of Maryland Baltimore]],<ref>http://www.gerontologyphd.umaryland.edu/application.html</ref> [[University of Massachusetts Boston]],<ref>http://www.umb.edu/academics/mgs/gerontology/graduate/gerontology_phd</ref> and the [[University of Southern California]].<ref>https://catalogue.usc.edu/schools/pharmacy/graduate/#gero</ref> The substantial increase in the aging population in post-industrial Western nations has led to this becoming one of the most rapidly growing fields.

From the 1950s to the 1970s, the field was mainly social and concerned with issues such as nursing homes and health care. However, research by [[Leonard Hayflick]] in the 1960s (showing that a cell line culture will only divide about 50 times) helped lead to a separate branch, biogerontology. It became apparent that simply treating aging was not enough. Developing an understanding of the aging process, and what could be done about it, became an issue. 

Biogerontology was also bolstered when research by Cynthia Kenyon and others demonstrated that life extension was possible in lower life forms such as [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], [[worm]]s, and [[yeast]]. So far, however, nothing more than incremental (marginal) increases in life span have been seen in any mammalian species.

== Biogerontology ==
Biogerontology is the sub-field of gerontology concerned with the [[Senescence|biological processes]] of aging and their evolutionary origins. It involves interdisciplinary research on biological aging's causes, effects, and mechanisms. Conservative biogerontologists such as [[Leonard Hayflick]] have predicted that the human life expectancy will peak at about 92 years old,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Watts G |title=Leonard Hayflick and the limits of ageing |journal=Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9783 |pages=2075 |year=2011 |month=June |pmid=21684371 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60908-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(11)60908-2}}</ref> although the consensus now is that the numbers will continue to rise.

The multidisciplinary focus of gerontology and biogerontology means that there are a number of subfields, ... (Biogerontology Net, retrieved by Dr. [[Robelyn Garcia]], 2010)

[[Biomedical gerontology]], also known as experimental gerontology and [[life extension]], is a sub-discipline of biogerontology that endeavors to slow, prevent, and even reverse aging in both humans and animals. Approaches include curing age-related diseases and slowing down the underlying processes of aging. Most "[[Anti-aging movement|life extensionists]]" believe the human life span can be increased within the next century, if not sooner. Optimists such as [[Aubrey de Grey]] estimate that the first person to live to a thousand years may have already been born. Some biogerontologists take an intermediate position, emphasizing the study of the aging process as a means of mitigating [[aging-associated diseases]], while either claiming that [[maximum life span]] cannot be altered or that it is undesirable to try.

As with biogerontology, geriatrics studies the biological causes and effects of aging. Both fields are considered by many scientists to be the most important frontiers in aging research.

=== Biological theories of aging ===
Theories of aging are numerous and no one theory has been accepted. There is a wide spectrum of the types of theories for the causes of aging with programmed theories on one extreme and error theories on the other. Regardless of the theory, a commonality is that as humans age, functions of the body decline.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite book |first1=Albert W. |last1=Taylor |first2=Michel J. author2-last=Johnson |title=Physiology of Exercise and Healthy Aging |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fcGtzfxkFhwC |year=2008 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-0-7360-5838-4}}</ref>

==== Wear and tear ====
Wear and tear theories of aging suggest that as an individual ages, body parts such as cells and organs wear out from continued use. Wearing of the body can be attributable to internal or external causes that eventually lead to an accumulation of insults which surpasses the capacity for repair. Due to these internal and external insults, cells lose their ability to regenerate, which ultimately leads to mechanical and chemical exhaustion. Some insults include chemicals in the air, food, or smoke. Other insults may be things such as viruses, trauma, free radicals, cross-linking, and high body temperature.<ref name= Taylor />

==== Genetic ====
Genetic theories of aging propose that aging is programmed within each individual's genes. According to this theory, genes dictate cellular longevity. Programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]], is determined by a "biological clock" via genetic information in the nucleus of the cell. Genes responsible for apoptosis provide an explanation for cell death, but are less applicable to death of an entire organism. An increase in cellular apoptosis may correlate to aging, but is not a 'cause of death'. Environmental factors and genetic mutations can influence gene expression and accelerate aging. More recently epigenetics have been explored as a contributing factor.

==== General imbalance ====
General Imbalance theories of aging suggest that body systems, such as the endocrine, nervous, and immune systems, gradually decline and ultimately fail to function. The rate of failure varies system by system.<ref name= Taylor />

==== Accumulation ====
Accumulation theories of aging suggest that aging is bodily decline that results from an accumulation of elements. Elements can be foreign and introduced to the body from the environment. Other elements can be the natural result of cell metabolism.<ref name= Taylor /> An example of an accumulation theory is the Free Radical Theory of Aging. According to this theory, byproducts of regular cell metabolism called [[free radical]]s interact with cellular components such as the [[cell membrane]] and [[DNA]] and cause irreversible damage.<ref name=Schneider>Schneider, E. L. (1992). "Biological theories of aging." Generations, 16(4), 7.</ref> A more recent and comprehensive accumulation theory by [[Aubrey de Grey|dr. Aubrey de Grey]] posits that aging is the consequence of the accumulation of 7 types of 'damage' at the molecular, cellular and intracellular levels.<ref name="pmid12844502">de Grey, Aubrey (January 8, 2003). "[http://www.mfoundation.org/files/sens/manu16.pdf An engineer's approach to the development of real anti-aging medicine]". ''Sci Aging Knowledge Environ''. 2003 (1): VP1. {{doi|10.1126/sageke.2003.1.vp1}}. PMID 12844502.</ref>

== Social gerontology ==
Social gerontology is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. 

Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in [[social work]], [[nursing]], psychology, [[sociology]], [[demography]], gerontology, or other [[social science]] disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.

Because issues of life span and life extension need numbers to quantify them, there is an overlap with [[demography]]. Those who study the demography of the human life span differ from those who study the social demographics of aging.

===Social work with older adults===
Social work with older adults, known as geriatric social work practice, is considered to be both a macro and micro practice with individuals over the age of 60 or 65, their families and communities, aging related policy, and [[aging research]].  Geriatric social workers typically provide counseling, [[Direct Service|direct services]], [[Medical case management|care coordination]], community planning, and advocacy in an array of agencies and organizations including private practice, [[home care|in home]], neighborhoods, hospitals, [[senior living|senior congregate living]], hospice/end of life care, senior centers, oncology centers and residential long term care facilities such as [[Nursing home|nursing facilities]]. At the macro level, geriatric social workers work within state departments of health, adult protective services, and at universities and colleges, as well as [[Administration on Aging]] offices on a federal level in the United States.

=== Social theories of aging ===
According to Dannefer, aging is an interactive process where the individual is affected by the environment while also influencing the environment in which he/she ages. Several theories of aging are developed to observed the aging process of older adults in society as well as how these processes are interpreted by men and women as they age.<ref name=Phillipson>{{cite book |first1=C. |last1=Phillipson |first2=J. |last2=Baars |chapter=Ch. 4: Social theory and social ageing |chapterurl=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C&pg=PA68 |editor1-first=J. |editor1-first=Bond |editor2-first=S.M.

==== Activity theory ====
[[Activity theory]] was developed and elaborated by Cavan, Havighurst, and Albrecht. According to this theory, older adults' self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.<ref name=Phillipson/>

Activity is preferable to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, post-industrial society, which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.
Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a desire to do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.<ref name="allnurses-breakroom.com">VickyRN. (August 2, '09). Theories of Aging (Part 3) - Sociological Theories. Retrieved Friday, April 20, 2012, from http://allnurses-breakroom.com/showthread.php?t=412760</ref>

==== Disengagement theory ====
[[Disengagement theory]] was developed by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose "ego-energy" and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.<ref name=Phillipson/>

Gradual withdrawal from society and relationships preserves social equilibrium and promotes self-reflection for elders who are freed from societal roles. It furnishes an orderly means for the transfer of knowledge, capital, and power from the older generation to the young. It makes it possible for society to continue functioning after valuable older members die.
Weakness: There is no base of evidence or research to support this theory. Additionally, many older people desire to remain occupied and involved with society. Imposed withdrawal from society may be harmful to elders and society alike. This theory has been largely discounted by gerontologists.<ref name="allnurses-breakroom.com"/>

==== Continuity theory ====
[[Continuity theory]] is an illusive concept. On the one hand,
to exhibit continuity can mean to remain the same, to
be uniform, homogeneous, unchanging, even humdrum.
This static view of continuity is not very applicable
to human aging. On the other hand, a dynamic
view of continuity starts with the idea of a basic
structure which persists over time, but it allows for a
variety of changes to occur within the context provided
by the basic structure. The basic structure is
coherent: It has an orderly or logical relation of parts
that is recognizably unique and that allows us to
differentiate that structure from others. With the
introduction of the concept of time, ideas such as
direction, sequence, character development, and
story line enter into the concept of continuity as it is
applied to the evolution of a human being. In this
paper, a dynamic concept of continuity is developed
and applied to the issue of adaptation to normal
aging.<ref>{{cite book |author=Blalock, H.M. |title=Conceptualization and measurement in the social sciences |publisher=Sage |location=Beverly Hills |year=1982 |isbn=0803918046 }}</ref>

A central premise of continuity theory is that, in
making adaptive choices, middle-aged and older
adults attempt to preserve and maintain existing internal
and external structures and that they prefer to
accomplish this objective by using continuity (i.e.,
applying familiar strategies in familiar arenas of life).
In middle and later life, adults are drawn by the
weight of past experience to use continuity as a
primary adaptive strategy for dealing with changes
associated with normal aging. To the extent that
change builds upon, and has links to, the person's
past, change is a part of continuity. As a result of both
their own perceptions and pressures from the social
environment, individuals who are adapting to normal
aging are both predisposed and motivated
toward inner psychological continuity as well as outward
continuity of social behavior and circumstances.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hage, J. |title=Techniques and problems of theory construction in sociology |publisher=Wiley Interscience |location=New York |year=1972 |isbn=0471338605 }}</ref>

Continuity theory views both internal and
external continuity as robust adaptive strategies that
are supported by both individual preference and
social sanctions. Continuity theory consists of general
adaptive principles that people who are normally
•Miami University, Oxford, Ohio 45056.
aging could be expected to follow, explanations of
how these principles work, and a specification of
general areas of life in which these principles could
be expected to apply. Accordingly, continuity theory
has enormous potential as a general theory of
adaptation to individual aging.<ref>{{cite book |first=Abraham |last=Kaplan |title=The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ks8wuZHSKs8C |year=1964 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0448-8}}</ref>

==== Age stratification theory ====
According to this theory, older adults born during different time periods form [[cohort]]s that define "age strata". There are two differences among strata: chronological age and historical experience. This theory makes two arguments. 1. Age is a mechanism for regulating behavior and as a result determines access to positions of power. 2. Birth cohorts play an influential role in the process of social change.<ref name=Phillipson/>

==== Life course theory ====
According to this theory, which stems from the Life Course Perspective (Bengston and Allen, 1993),<ref name=life>Life Course Theory-Historical Development, Key Principles and Concepts, Selected Research Applications:http://family.jrank.org/pages/1074/Life-Course-Theory.html</ref> aging occurs from birth to death. Aging involves social, psychological, and biological processes. Additionally, aging experiences are shaped by cohort historical factors.<ref name=Phillipson/>

Also reflecting the life course focus,
consider the implications for how societies might function when age-based
norms vanish—a consequence of the deinstitutionalization of the life course—
and suggest that these implications pose new challenges for theorizing aging
and the life course in postindustrial societies. Dramatic reductions in mortality,
morbidity, and fertility over the past several decades have so shaken up the
organization of the life course and the nature of educational, work, family, and
leisure experiences that it is now possible for individuals to become old in new
ways. The configurations and content of other life stages are being altered as

==== Cumulative advantage/disadvantage theory ====
According to this theory, which was developed beginning in the 1960s by Derek Price and Robert Merton and elaborated on by several researchers such as Dale Dannefer,<ref name=Dennefer>{{cite journal |author=Dannefer D |title=Cumulative advantage/disadvantage and the life course: cross-fertilizing age and social science theory |journal=J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=S327–37 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14614120 }}</ref> inequalities have a tendency to become more pronounced throughout the aging process. A paradigm of this theory can be expressed in the adage "[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]". Advantages and disadvantages in early life stages have a profound effect throughout the life span. However, advantages and disadvantages in middle adulthood have a direct influence on economic and health status in later life.<ref name=Phillipson/>
