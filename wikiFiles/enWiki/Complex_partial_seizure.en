A '''complex partial seizure''' is an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] that is associated with bilateral [[cerebral hemisphere]] involvement and causes [[impairment]] of [[awareness]] or responsiveness, i.e. alteration of consciousness.<ref>Trescher, William H., and Ronald P. Lescher 2000, p. 1748.</ref>

==Presentation==
Complex partial seizures are often preceded by a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] [[aura (symptom)|aura]].<ref name="Trescher, William H. 1749">Trescher, William H., and Ronald P. Lescher 2000, p. 1749.</ref>   The seizure aura is a [[simple partial seizure]].<ref name="Trescher, William H. 1749"/>  The [[aura (symptom)|aura]] may manifest itself as a feeling of [[déjà vu]], [[jamais vu]], fear, [[euphoria]] or [[depersonalization]].<ref name="Murro, Anthony M. 2006">Murro, Anthony M. 2006.</ref>  The seizure [[aura (symptom)|aura]] might also occur as a visual disturbance, such as [[tunnel vision]] or a change in the size of objects ([[macropsia]] or [[micropsia]]).<ref>Engelsen, B A., C Tzoulis, B Karlsen, A Lillebø, L M 2008.</ref>  Once consciousness is impaired, the person may display [[automatic behavior|automatism]]s such as lip smacking, chewing or swallowing.<ref name="Murro, Anthony M. 2006"/> There may also be loss of memory ([[amnesia]]) surrounding the seizure event.<ref name="Trescher, William H. 1749"/>  The person may still be able to perform routine tasks such as walking, although such movements are not purposeful or planned.  Witnesses may not recognize that anything is wrong.

Complex partial seizures might arise from any [[lobe (anatomy)|lobe]] of the brain.<ref name="Trescher, William H. 1749"/>  Complex partial seizures most commonly arise from the [[Wiktionary:mesial|mesial]] [[temporal lobe]], particularly the [[amygdala]], [[hippocampus]], and [[Wiktionary:neocortex|neocortical]] regions.<ref>Trescher, William H., and Ronald P. Lescher 2000, p. 1750.</ref>  A common associated brain abnormality is [[mesial temporal sclerosis]].<ref name="Murro, Anthony M. 2006"/>  Mesial temporal sclerosis is a specific pattern of hippocampal neuronal loss accompanied by hippocampal [[gliosis]] and atrophy.<ref>Trepeta, Scott 2007.</ref>  Complex partial seizures occur when excessive and synchronous electrical brain activity causes impaired awareness and responsiveness.<ref>"International League Against Epilepsy." 2008.</ref>  The abnormal electrical activity might spread to the rest of the brain and cause a secondary generalized [[tonic–clonic seizure]].<ref>Trescher, William H., and Ronald P. Lescher 2000, p. 1747.</ref>
