In [[medicine]] ([[obstetrics]]), the term '''fetal distress''' refers to the presence of signs in a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman<ref>{{MeshName|Fetal+Distress}}</ref>&mdash;before or during [[childbirth]]&mdash;that suggest that the [[fetus]] may not be well. Because of its lack of precision, the term is eschewed in modern American obstetrics.<ref name=acog>{{cite journal | author=ACOG  |title=Committee Opinion, Number 326, December 2005: Inappropriate Use of the Terms Fetal Distress and Birth Asphyxia. |accessdate=June 9, 2010|url=http://www.acog.org/publications/committee_opinions/co326.cfm}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Generally it is preferable to describe specific signs in lieu of declaring ''fetal distress'' that include:
*Decreased movement felt by the mother
*[[Meconium]] in the [[amniotic fluid]] ("meconium stained liquor")
*Non-reassuring patterns seen on [[cardiotocography]]:
**increased or decreased fetal [[heart rate]] ([[tachycardia]] and [[bradycardia]]), especially during and after a [[contraction (childbirth)|contraction]]
**decreased variability in the fetal [[heart rate]]
**late decelerations
*Biochemical signs, assessed by collecting a small sample of baby's blood from a scalp prick through the open cervix in labor
**fetal metabolic [[acidosis]]
**elevated fetal blood lactate levels (from [[fetal scalp blood testing]]) indicating the baby has a [[lactic acidosis]]

Some of these signs are more reliable predictors of fetal compromise than others. For example, cardiotocography can give high false positive rates, even when interpreted by highly experienced medical personnel. Metabolic acidosis is a more reliable predictor, but is not always available.

==Causes==
There are many causes of "fetal distress" including:
* [[Breath]]ing problems
* Abnormal position and presentation of the fetus
* [[Multiple birth]]s
* [[Shoulder dystocia]]
* [[Umbilical cord prolapse]]
* [[Nuchal cord]]
* [[Placental abruption]]
* Premature closure of the fetal [[ductus arteriosus]]
* [[Uterine rupture]]
* [[Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy]], a liver disorder during pregnancy

==Treatment==
Instead of referring to "fetal distress" current recommendations hold to look for more specific signs and symptoms, assess them, and take the appropriate steps to remedy the situation.<ref name=acog/> Traditionally the diagnosis of "fetal distress"  led the [[obstetrician]] to recommend rapid delivery by instrumental delivery or by [[caesarean section]] if vaginal delivery is not advised.
