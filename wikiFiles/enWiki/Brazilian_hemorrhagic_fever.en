'''Brazilian hemorrhagic fever (BzHF)''' is an [[infectious disease]] caused by the '''Sabiá virus''', an [[Arenavirus]]. The Sabiá virus is an [[Viral envelope|enveloped]] [[RNA virus]] and is highly infectious and lethal.<ref name="NRT">[http://www.nrt.org/production/NRT/NRTWeb.nsf/AllAttachmentsByTitle/A-1009WMDQRGBHF/$File/07BrazilianHemorrhagicFever(BzHF)QRG.pdf?OpenElement NRT Quick Reference Guide: Brazilian Hemorrhagic Fever (BzHF)]</ref>

The [[incubation period]] is between 7–16 days, during which signs and symptoms can develop. Initial [[medical sign|sign]]s and [[symptom]]s can include [[fever]], [[Red eye (medicine)|eye redness]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[dizziness]], [[muscle ache]]s, [[Muscle weakness|loss of strength]], and [[exhaustion]]. Severe cases show signs of bleeding under the skin, internal organs, or from body orifices like the [[mouth]], [[Human eye|eye]]s, or [[ear]]s. Severely ill patients show [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], nervous system malfunction, [[coma]], [[delirium]], and [[seizure]]s.<ref name="NRT"/>

The Sabiá virus can be acquired through [[inhalation]], ingestion, the eyes, and contact with [[urine]], [[saliva]], [[blood]], or [[feces]] of [[rodent]]s.<ref name="NRT">http://www.nrt.org/production/NRT/NRTWeb.nsf/AllAttachmentsByTitle/A-1009WMDQRGBHF/$File/07BrazilianHemorrhagicFever(BzHF)QRG.pdf?OpenElement NRT Quick Reference Guie: Brazilian Hemorrhagic Fever (BzHF)</ref>

The Sabiá virus is a [[Biosafety level|Biosafety Level 4]] pathogen.<ref name="NRT"/>

To date, there have only been three reported infections of the Sabiá virus. Only one known case of naturally contracted Sabiá virus occurred in a woman staying in the village of [[Sabiá]], outside of [[São Paulo]], in 1990. Two other cases occurred in a clinical setting which are the viriologist who was responsible for the study of the woman's disease, contracted the disease as during the course of his research; he, fortunately, survived. Four years later, while working under level 3 biohazard conditions, a researcher at the Tropical Medicine Clinic at Yale-New Haven Hospital was exposed to the virus. Exposure apparently resulted when a centrifuge bottle containing infected tissue cracked and leaked into the spinning centrifuge, releasing aerosolized virus particles into the air. One of the scientists who was infected was treated with [[ribavirin]].<ref>http://www.stanford.edu/group/virus/arena/2005/SabiaVirus.htm Sabia Virus</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Barry |first=M. |last2=Russi |first2=M. |last3=Armstrong |first3=L. |last4=Geller |first4=D. |last5=Tesh |first5=R. |last6=Dembry |first6=L. |last7=Gonzalez |first7=J.

This virus has also been implicated as a means for [[bioterrorism]], as it can be spread through [[aerosol]]s.<ref>http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/acd/bioterrorism/backvhf.pdf Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers and Bioterrorism</ref>
