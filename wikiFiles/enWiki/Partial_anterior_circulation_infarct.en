'''Partial Anterior Circulation Infarct''' ('''PACI''') is a type of [[cerebral infarction]] affecting part of the [[anterior]] [[circulatory system|circulation]] supplying one side of the [[brain]].

'''Partial Anterior Circulation Stroke Syndrome''' ('''PACS''') refers to the symptoms of a patient who clinically appears to have suffered from a partial anterior circulation infarct, but who has not yet had any diagnostic imaging (e.g. [[CT Scan]]) to confirm the diagnosis.

It is diagnosed by any one of the following
* 2 out of 3 features of
** Higher dysfunction
*** [[Dysphasia]]
*** [[Visuospatial]] disturbances
** [[Homonymous hemianopia]]
** Motor and Sensory Defects (>2/3 of face, arm, leg)
* Higher dysfunction alone
* Partial Motor or Sensory Defect

If all of the above symptoms are present, a [[Total Anterior Circulation Infarct]] is more likely.
