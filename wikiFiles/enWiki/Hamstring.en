In [[human anatomy]], the '''hamstring''' is a group of tendons contracted by three posterior thigh [[muscles]] ([[semitendinosus]], [[semimembranosus]] and [[biceps femoris]]) that make up the borders of the space behind the knee, or their corresponding [[tendon]]s.

In [[quadruped]]s, it is the single large tendon found behind the knee or comparable area.

==Etymology==
The word ''ham'' originally referred to the fat and muscle behind the [[knee]]. ''String'' refers to tendons, and thus, the hamstrings are the string-like tendons felt on either side of the back of the knee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hamstring |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref> 

The three muscles of the posterior [[thigh]] (semitendinosus, semimembranosus, biceps femoris long & short head) [[Flexion|flex]] (bend) the knee, while all but the short head of biceps femoris [[Extension (kinesiology)|extend]] (straighten) the hip. The three 'true' hamstrings cross both the hip and the knee joint and are therefore involved in knee flexion and hip extension. The short head of the biceps femoris crosses only one joint (knee) and is therefore not involved in hip extension. With its divergent origin and innervation it is sometimes excluded from the 'hamstring' characterization.<ref name='norman'>{{Norman Anatomy|postthigh}}</ref>

A portion of the [[adductor magnus]] is sometimes considered a part of the hamstrings.<ref name='norman' />

==Functions==
The hamstrings cross and act upon two joints - the [[hip]] and the [[knee]].

Semitendinosus and semimembranosus extend the hip when the trunk is fixed; they also flex the knee and medially (inwardly) rotate the lower leg when the knee is bent. 

The long head of the biceps femoris extends the hip as when beginning to walk; both short and long heads flex the knee and laterally (outwardly) rotates the lower leg when the knee is bent.

The hamstrings play a crucial role in many daily activities, such as, walking, running, jumping, and controlling some movement in the trunk. In walking, they are most important as an [[antagonist (muscle)|antagonist]] to the [[quadriceps]] in the deceleration of knee extension.

==Imaging==

Imaging the hamstring muscles is usually performed with an [[ultrasound]] and/or [[MRI]].<ref name="pmid12942206">{{cite journal |author=Koulouris G, Connell D. |title=Evaluation of the hamstring muscle complex following acute injury|journal= Skeletal Radiol.|volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=582–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12942206}}</ref>  The biceps femoris is most commonly injured, followed by semitendinosus. Semimembranosus injury is rare. Imaging is useful in differentiating the grade of strain, especially if the muscle is completely torn.<ref name="pmid18360748">{{cite journal |author=Schache AG, Koulouris G, Kofoed W, Morris HG, Pandy MG |title=Rupture of the conjoint tendon at the proximal musculotendinous junction of the biceps femoris long head: a case report.|journal= Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc.|volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=797–802 |year=2008 |pmid=18360748}}</ref> In this setting, the level and degree of retraction can be determined, serving as a useful roadmap prior to any surgery. Those with a hamstring strain of greater than 60mm in length have a greater risk of recurrence.<ref name="pmid174262838">{{cite journal |author=Koulouris G, Connell DA, Brukner P, Schneider-Kolsky M. |title=Magnetic resonance imaging parameters for assessing risk of recurrent hamstring injuries in elite athletes.|journal= Am J Sports Med.|volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=1500–6 |year=2007 |pmid=174262838}}</ref>

==Use in surgery==
The [[distal]] semitendinosus tendon is one of the tendons that can be used in the [[surgery|surgical procedure]] [[anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction|ACL reconstruction]]. In this procedure, a piece of it is used to replace the [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL). The ACL is one of the four major ligaments in the knee.

==Training==
In [[strength training]], [[Squat (exercise)|squats]], [[Leg curl|knee curls]] and the  [[Deadlift#Variations|Romanian deadlift]] are combined with other [[List of weight training exercises#Lower body|lower body exercises]] to develop the hamstrings.

Hamstring extension is key to determining [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], assessed by performing a [[sit and reach]] test.
