''' Point-of-care genetic testing ''' incorporates the newest most sophisticated techniques to identify variations in the genetic sequence at the bedside â€“ enabling clinicians to react and alter therapy based upon the results.

Traditional [[genetic testing]] involves the analysis of [[DNA]] in order to detect [[genotype]]s related to a heritable disease or [[phenotype]] of interest for clinical purposes. However, current testing methods require days to weeks before results are available limiting the clinical applicability of [[genetic testing]] in a number of circumstances.

Recently, the first [[point-of-care]] genetic test in medicine was demonstrated to be effective in identifying [[CYP2C19]]*2 carriers allowing tailoring of anti-platelet regimens to reduce high on treatment platelet reactivity.<ref>http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960161-5/abstract#</ref> In the RAPID GENE study,<ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01184300</ref> Drs. Jason Roberts and Derek So from the [[University of Ottawa Heart Institute]] validated a [[pharmacogenomics]] approach in patients undergoing [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] for [[acute coronary syndrome]] or stable [[coronary artery disease]].<ref>http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/health/first-bedside-gene-test-shows-promise-144912695.html</ref><ref>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/new-health/conditions/heart-and-stroke/treatment/new-bedside-genetic-tests-pick-the-right-drug-right-away/article2393347/</ref><ref>http://blogs.theheart.org/topolog/2012/4/11/taking-pointofcare-genetic-testing-closer-to-mainstream?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Topolog+%28Topolog%29</ref>

This study is the first in medicine to incorporate [[point-of-care testing]] with [[genetics]] into routine clinical care and decision making.<ref>http://clinicaltrialresults.org/Slides/TCT%202011/So%20Late%20breaking%20Trial%20RAPID%20GENE%20TCT%20web%20site%20version.pdf</ref>
