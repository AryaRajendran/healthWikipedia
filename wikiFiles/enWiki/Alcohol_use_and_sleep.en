[[Ethanol]], the type of [[alcohol]] found in [[alcoholic drinks]], can exacerbate sleep problems. During [[abstinence]], sleep disruption is one the greatest predictors of [[relapse]].<ref name="Feige et al.">Feige, B., Scaal, S., Hornyak, M., Gann, H., Riemann, D. Sleep electroencephalographic spectral power after withdrawal from alcohol in alcohol-dependent patients. ALcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. 2007 Jan; 31 (1): 19-27.</ref>

==Moderate alcohol consumption and sleep disruptions==
Moderate alcohol consumption 30–60 minutes before bedtime results in disruptions in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture that are mediated by [[blood alcohol level]]s.<ref name="Roehrs & Roth">Roehrs, T., and Roth, T. Sleep, sleepiness, and alcohol use. Alcohol Research & Health. 2001; 25(2):101-109.</ref> Disruptions in sleep maintenance are most marked once alcohol has been completely [[metabolized]] from the body. Under conditions of moderate alcohol consumption where blood alcohol levels average 0.06–0.08% and decrease 0.01–0.02% per hour, an alcohol clearance rate of 4–5 hours would coincide with disruptions in sleep maintenance in the second half of an 8-hour sleep episode.<ref name="Roehrs & Roth"/> In terms of sleep architecture, moderate doses of alcohol facilitate "rebounds" in [[rapid eye movement (sleep)|rapid eye movement]] (REM) and [[Sleep#Stages of sleep|stage 1 sleep]]; following suppression in REM and stage 1 sleep in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode, REM and stage 1 sleep increase well beyond baseline in the second half. Moderate doses of alcohol also increase [[slow wave sleep]] (SWS) in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode.<ref name="Roehrs & Roth"/> Enhancements in REM sleep and SWS following moderate alcohol consumption are mediated by reductions in [[glutamatergic]] activity by [[adenosine]] in the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="Roehrs & Roth"/> In addition, tolerance to changes in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture develops within 3 days of alcohol consumption before bedtime.<ref name="Roehrs & Roth"/>

==Alcohol consumption and sleep improvements==
Low doses of alcohol (one 360 ml (13 imp fl oz; 12 US fl oz) [[beer]]) are sleep-promoting by increasing total sleep time and reducing awakenings during the night. The sleep-promoting benefits of alcohol [[dissipate]] at moderate and higher doses of alcohol (two 12 oz. beers and three 12 oz. beers, respectively).<ref>Stone, B. Sleep and low doses of alcohol. Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology. 1980; 48: 706-709.</ref> Previous experience with alcohol also determines whether or not alcohol is a "sleep promoter" or "sleep disrupter." Under free-choice conditions, in which subjects chose between drinking alcohol or water, inexperienced drinkers were sedated while experienced drinkers were stimulated following alcohol consumption.<ref>Schuckit, M.A. Low level of response to alcohol as a predictor of future alcoholism. Am J Psychiatry. 1994 Feb; 151(2):184-189.</ref> In [[insomnia]]cs, moderate doses of alcohol improve sleep maintenance.<ref>Roehrs, T., Papineau, B.A., Rosenthal, L., Roth, T. Ethanol as a hypnotic in insomniacs: self administration and effects on sleep and mood. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1999 Mar; 20(3):279-86.</ref>

==Alcohol consumption and fatigue==
Sleepiness influences the severity of alcohol consumption. Conditions of [[sleep deprivation]] encourage more episodes of alcohol consumption.<ref name="Roehrs & Roth"/> Increased alcohol consumption during the winter months for Northern climate residents is attributed to escalations in fatigue.<ref>Levine, M.E., Duffy, L.K., Bowyer, R.T. Fatigue, sleep, and seasonal hormone levels: implications for drinking behavior in Northern climates. Drugs & Society. 1994; 8(2): 61-70.</ref>

==Alcohol abstinence and sleep disruptions==
Sleep and [[hormonal]] disruptions following withdrawal from chronic alcohol consumption are the greatest predictors of relapse.<ref name="Feige et al."/> During abstinence, recovering alcoholics have attenuated [[melatonin]] secretion in the beginning of a sleep episode, resulting in prolonged sleep latencies.<ref name="Kühlwein et al.">Kühlwein, E., Hauger, R.L., Irwin, M.R. Abnormal nocturnal melatonin secretion and disordered sleep in abstinent alcoholics. Biol Psychiatry. 2003; 54: 1437-1443.</ref> Escalations in [[cortisol]] and [[core body temperature]]s during the sleep period contribute to poor sleep maintenance.<ref name="Kühlwein et al."/><ref>Danel, T., Libersa, C., Touitou, Y. The effect of alcohol consumption on the circadian control of human core body temperature is time dependent. Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol. 2001; 281: R52-R55.</ref>
