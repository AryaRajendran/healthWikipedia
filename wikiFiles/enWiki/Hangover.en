A '''hangover''' {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|h|æ|ŋ|əʊ|v|ər}} ([[medical terminology]]: ''' ''veisalgia'') '''is the experience of various unpleasant physiological effects following heavy consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. The most commonly reported characteristics of a hangover include [[headache]], [[nausea]], [[photophobia|sensitivity to light]] and [[phonophobia|noise]], [[lethargy]], [[dysphoria]], [[diarrhea]] and [[thirst]], typically after the intoxicating effect of the alcohol begins to wear off. While a hangover can be experienced at any time, generally a hangover is experienced the morning after a night of heavy drinking. In addition to the physical symptoms, a hangover may also induce psychological symptoms including heightened feelings of [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]].

[[Hypoglycemia]], [[dehydration]], [[acetaldehyde]] [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], and [[glutamine]] rebound are all theorized causes of hangover symptoms.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Perry |first=Lacy |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/hangover.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "How Hangovers Work" |publisher=Health.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> Hangover symptoms may persist for several days after alcohol was last consumed.

==Causes==
Hangovers are caused by several factors.  First, the body has to [[metabolize]] the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages: [[ethanol]].  This process requires cellular energy, distracting the body from normal activities like making [[glucose]] for the brain.  Even after all the ethanol is metabolized, the by-products of this process can cause additional problems.  Likewise, [[congener (alcohol)|other substances in certain alcoholic beverages]] can make a hangover worse.  Lastly, ethanol is a [[diuretic]] and can lead to dehydration. 

===Metabolism===
After being ingested, ethanol is first converted to [[acetaldehyde]] by the enzyme [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and then to [[acetic acid]] by the enzyme [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]].  These reactions also convert [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] to NADH.  However, by causing a shortage of NAD<sup>+</sup> and an excess of NADH, alcoholic beverages make normal bodily functions more difficult.  For example, excess NADH causes the important [[citric acid cycle]] to shut down by inhibiting three important enzymes ([[citrate synthase]], [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]], and [[alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]]).

To correct this imbalance the body uses [[pyruvate]] and [[lactate dehydrogenase]] to convert the excess NADH back into NAD<sup>+</sup>.  In the process, however, the body diverts pyruvate from other important pathways such as [[gluconeogenesis]]. This impares the ability of the liver to compensate for a drop in blood glucose levels, especially for the brain. Because glucose is the primary energy source of the brain, this lack of glucose ([[hypoglycemia]]) contributes to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, mood disturbances, and decreased attention and concentration.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Additionally, alcohol induces the [[CYP2E1]] enzyme, which itself can produce additional toxins and free radicals.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kessova I, Cederbaum AI |title=CYP2E1: biochemistry, toxicology, regulation and function in ethanol-induced liver injury |journal=Curr.

===By-products of ethanol===
Acetaldehyde, the first by-product of ethanol, is between 10 and 30 times more toxic than alcohol itself.<ref name=Sprince74>{{Cite journal|author=Sprince H, Parker CM, Smith GG, Gonzales LJ |title=Protection against acetaldehyde toxicity in the rat by L-cysteine, thiamin and L-2-methylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid |journal=Agents Actions |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=125–30 |year=1974 |month=April |pmid=4842541 |doi= 10.1007/BF01966822|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w307w62037125v33/}}</ref>  In addition, certain genetic factors can amplify the negative effects of acetaldehyde.  For example, [[East Asia]]n people have a [[mutation]] in their [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] [[gene]] that makes this enzyme unusually fast at converting ethanol to acetaldehyde.  Therefore, acetaldehyde accumulates faster in those people.  In addition, about half of these people are slower at converting the acetaldehyde to acetic acid (via [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]]), causing the acetaldehyde to build-up even more.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Xiao Q, Weiner H, Crabb DW |title=The mutation in the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) gene responsible for alcohol-induced flushing increases turnover of the enzyme tetramers in a dominant fashion |journal=J.

Since hangovers might be immediate and severe in some of these people, they are less likely to become [[alcoholic]]s.<ref>{{Cite book

Likewise, [[acetic acid]] (or the [[acetate|acetate ion]]) can cause additional problems.  One study found that [[intraperitoneal injection|injecting]] [[sodium acetate]] into rats caused them to have [[nociception|nociceptive behavior]] (headaches).  In addition, there is a biochemical explanation for this finding. High acetate levels cause [[adenosine]] to accumulate in many parts of the brain.  But when the rats were given caffeine, which [[receptor antagonist|blocks the action]] of adensonine, they didn't get headaches anymore.<ref>http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015963</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21209842 | year = 2010 | last1 = Maxwell | first1 = CR | last2 = Spangenberg | first2 = RJ | last3 = Hoek | first3 = JB | last4 = Silberstein | first4 = SD | last5 = Oshinsky | first5 = ML | title = Acetate Causes Alcohol Hangover Headache in Rats | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = e15963 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0015963 | pmc = 3013144 | journal = PLoS ONE | editor1-last = Skoulakis | editor1-first = Efthimios M.

===Congeners===
In addition to ethanol and water, most alcoholic drinks also contain [[congeners]], either as flavoring or as a by-product of [[fermentation]].  However, different types of alcohol contain different amounts of congeners.  In general, dark liquors have a higher concentration while clear liquors have a lower concentration.

Several studies have examined whether certain types of alcohol cause worse hangovers.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Wiese JG, Shlipak MG, Browner WS |title=The alcohol hangover |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=132 |issue=11 |pages=897–902 |date=6 June 2000|pmid=10836917  |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/132/11/897 }}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|author=8:32 p.m. ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34485233/ns/health-behavior/ |title=Whiskey hangover worse than vodka, study says |work=MSNBC |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2010-02-03}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal | author = Pawan GLS|title= Alcoholic drinks and hangover effects. |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |year=1973 |volume= 32|page=15A|pmid=4760771 |issue=1}}</ref><ref name="Verster_2006">{{cite journal | author = Verster J.

One potent congener is [[methanol]]. It is naturally formed in small quantities during fermentation and it can be accidentally concentrated by improper distillation techniques. Metabolism of methanol produces an extremely toxic compound, [[formaldehyde]]; however, its metabolism is suppressed when ethanol is present in the bloodstream. Therefore, methanol is a likely cause of hangovers that begin when the person's blood alcohol level approaches zero.  Incidentally, these hangovers can be "cured" by consuming more ethanol.

===Dehydration and Age===
Ethanol has a [[dehydration|dehydrating]] effect by causing increased urine production ([[diuretic|diuresis]]), which causes headaches, dry mouth, and [[lethargy]].  Dehydration also causes fluids in the brain to be less plentiful.  This can be mitigated by drinking [[water]] before, during and after consumption of alcohol. Alcohol's effect on the stomach lining can account for nausea.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  In addition, it is often said that hangovers grow worse as one ages; this is thought to be caused by declining supplies of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme involved in metabolizing alcohol.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1226478/Medical-miscellany-Why-hangovers-worse-age.html |title=Medical miscellany: Why hangovers get worse with age  |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=2009-11-10 |accessdate=2010-03-26 |location=London}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}

An [[ethanol|alcohol]] hangover is associated with a variety of [[symptoms]] that may include [[dehydration]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[headache]], body aches, [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[flatulence]], [[weakness]], elevated [[body temperature]] and [[heart rate]], [[hypersalivation]], difficulty concentrating, sweating, [[anxiety]], [[dysphoria]], [[irritability]], sensitivity to light and noise, erratic motor functions (including [[tremor]]), trouble sleeping, severe hunger, [[halitosis]], and lack of depth perception. Many people will also be repulsed by the thought, taste or smell of alcohol during a hangover. The symptoms vary                                    significantly from person to person, and it is not clear whether hangovers directly affect [[cognitive]] abilities.

==Research==
[[Psychology|Psychological research]] of alcohol hangover is growing rapidly. The Alcohol Hangover Research Group had its inaugural meeting in June 2010 as part of the [[Research Society on Alcoholism]] (RSA) 33rd Annual Scientific Meeting in San Antonio, Texas. 

In 2010, researchers from the Centre for Alcohol and Drug Research at the University of Aarhus in Copenhagen charted how hangovers progress over time in the face of continued drinking. They found no evidence of hangover tolerance. Instead, they found that hangover symptoms became steadily worse over the course of one week.<ref name=Hesse>{{Cite journal|title=Predictors of hangover during a week of heavy drinking on holiday |author=Hesse |work=Addiction| volume=105|issue=3|year=2010|pages=476–483|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02816.x/abstract;jsessionid=AFF1E956D9E40EE2636A8B33B6BB83A8.d03t01|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02816.x}}</ref>

In 2012, Éduc'alcool, a Quebec-based non-profit organization that aims to educate the public on the responsible use of alcohol, published a report noting hangovers have long-lasting effects that inhibit the drinker's capabilities a full 24 hours after heavy drinking.<ref>Éduc’alcool, [http://educalcool.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Lendemains-de-veille-ANG.pdf "Alcohol and Health: Alcohol Hangover"], July 2012.</ref>

Within the limited amount of serious study on the subject, there is debate about whether a hangover may be prevented or at least mitigated; additionally, there is a vast body of [[folk medicine]] and simple [[quackery]]. There is currently no empirically proven mechanism for prevention except reducing the amount of ethanol consumed, or for making oneself [[Sobriety|sober]] other than waiting for the body to metabolize ingested alcohol, which occurs via oxidation through the liver before alcohol leaves the body. A four-page literature review in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' concludes: "No compelling evidence exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover. The most effective way to avoid the symptoms of alcohol induced hangover is to avoid drinking."<ref name="PMID16373736">{{Cite journal|author=Pittler MH, Verster JC, Ernst E |title=Interventions for preventing or treating alcohol hangover: systematic review of randomised controlled trials |journal=BMJ |volume=331 |issue=7531 |pages=1515–8 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16373736 |pmc=1322250 |doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7531.1515 |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/331/7531/1515}}</ref>

* [[Food]] and [[water]]: consumption of foods such as eggs, which contain [[cysteine]], and water may be enough to replenish lost moisture and at least rehydrate the body, making a hangover shorter. Researchers has found that [[beef noodle soup]] "[[Yaka mein]]" commonly found in [[New Orleans]] work as an effective cure for hangovers.<ref>[http://food.ninemsn.com.au/howto/expertadvice/8640674/old-sober-soup-the-perfect-hangover-cure 'Old sober' soup the perfect hangover cure: report]</ref> A traditional hangover remedy in India is [[coconut water]], the natural [[electrolyte]]s of which will assist in rehydration of the body.

* [[Oxygen therapy|Oxygen]]: There have been anecdotal reports from those with easy access to a breathing oxygen supply&nbsp;– medical staff, [[Scuba diving|SCUBA divers]] and military pilots&nbsp;— that oxygen can also reduce the symptoms of hangovers sometimes caused by alcohol consumption.  The theory is that the increased oxygen flow resulting from oxygen therapy improves the metabolic rate, and thus increases the speed at which toxins are broken down.<ref>{{cite news | first1=Timothy |last1=Walker |first2=Mary |last2=Fitzgerald |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/a-drinkers-guide-to-hangover-cures-445085.html |title=A drinker's guide to hangovers|newspaper=The Independent|date= 17 April 2007 |location=London }}</ref> However, one source states that (in an aviation context) oxygen has no effect on physical impairment caused by hangover.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Reihheart |first=Richard|title=Basic Flight Physiology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |page=179 |year=2007 |isbn=0-7735-0801-5 }}</ref>

* [[Acetylcysteine]]:  There are claims that N-acetylcysteine can relieve or prevent symptoms of hangover through scavenging of acetylaldehyde, particularly when taken concurrently with alcohol.<ref>Fawkes, SW [http://www.ceri.com/alcohol.htm CERI: Living with Alcohol] ''Smart Drug News'' 1996 Dec 13</ref> Additional reduction in acetaldehyde toxicity can be achieved if NAC is taken in conjunction with vitamin B<sub>1</sub> (thiamine).<ref name=Sprince74/>
* Acétyl-leucine:  Sold under the brand name of Tanganil, this is the standard remedy prescribed to people suffering from chronic [[vertigo]], and so may lessen the "whirling pit" effect of a hangover, where there is a dysfunction between the nerves which control the notion of balance in the ears and the brain.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
* [[Marijuana]]: It is commonly believed that THC, the active chemical in marijuana, is an effective hangover remedy.  THC may help ease the main symptoms of hangovers: nausea and headache. The advantage is two-fold; as once a sufferer's nausea has abated, and his appetite is stimulated, hypoglycemia becomes easier to resolve.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Ineffective or unproven remedies===
Recommendations for foods, drinks and activities to relieve hangover symptoms abound. The ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], on the authority of [[Pliny the Elder]], favored raw [[owl]]'s eggs or fried [[Atlantic Canary|canary]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2003/01/01/cx_cd_0101featsidebar_3.html | work=Forbes}}</ref> while the "[[Prairie Oyster (cocktail)|Prairie Oyster]]" restorative, introduced at the 1878 Paris World Exposition, calls for raw egg yolk mixed with [[Worcestershire sauce]], [[Tabasco sauce]], salt and pepper.<ref name="Felten"/> By 1938, the [[Ritz-Carlton]] Hotel provided a hangover remedy in the form of a mixture of [[Coca-Cola]] and milk<ref name="Felten">{{Cite news|last=Felten |first=Eric |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123032812870836003.html |title=Recipe to Cure a New Year's Eve Hangover - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2008-12-27 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> (Coca-Cola itself having been invented, by some accounts,<ref>{{Cite web|author=Ian Ellis |url=http://www.todayinsci.com/3/3_29.htm |title=March 29 - Today in Science History |publisher=Todayinsci.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.colamyths.com/ |title=// Welcome To |publisher=Colamyths.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> as a hangover remedy).

* [[Kudzu]] (''Pueraria montana var. lobata''): The main ingredient in remedies such as [[kakkonto]].
