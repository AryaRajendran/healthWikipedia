'''Vasoconstriction''' is the narrowing of the blood vessels resulting from contraction of the muscular wall of the vessels, particularly the large [[arteries]] and small [[arterioles]]. The process is the opposite of [[vasodilation]], the widening of blood vessels. The process is particularly important in staunching [[hemorrhage]] and acute blood loss. When blood vessels constrict, the flow of blood is restricted or decreased, thus, retaining body heat or increasing [[vascular resistance]]. [[Skin|Cutaneously]], this makes the skin turn paler because less blood reaches the surface, reducing the radiation of heat. On a larger level, vasoconstriction is one mechanism by which the body regulates and maintains [[mean arterial pressure]].

Substances causing vasoconstriction are called '''vasoconstrictors''', '''vasopressors''', or simply '''"pressors"'''. Generalized vasoconstriction usually results in an increase in systemic blood pressure, but it may also occur in specific tissues causing a localized reduction in blood flow. The extent of vasoconstriction may be slight or severe depending on the substance or circumstance. Many vasoconstrictors also cause [[Pupillary response|pupil dilation]]. Medications that cause vasoconstriction include [[antihistamines]], [[decongestants]] and [[stimulant]]s used to treat [[ADHD]].

==General mechanism==
The mechanism that leads to vasoconstriction results from the increased concentration of [[calcium]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup> [[ions]]) within vascular [[smooth muscle cells]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Thromboxane A2-induced contraction of rat caudal arterial smooth muscle involves activation of Ca2+ entry and Ca2+sensitization: Rho-associated kinase-mediated phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-855 but not Thr-697|author=Michael P. Walsh, et all|url=http://biosupport.licor.com/docs/2005/BJ20050237.pdf| doi = 10.1042/BJ20050237 | pmid = 15823093|pmc=1180727|volume=389|issue=Pt 3|year=2005|month=August|journal=Biochem. J.|pages=763–74}}</ref> However, the specific mechanisms for generating an increased intracellular concentration of calcium depends on the vasoconstrictor. Smooth muscle cells are capable of generating [[action potentials]], but this mechanism is rarely utilized for contraction in the vasculature. [[Hormonal]] or pharmokinetic components are more physiologically relevant. Two common stimuli for eliciting smooth muscle contraction is circulating [[epinephrine]] and activation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] (through release of [[norepinephrine]]) that directly innervates the muscle. These compounds interact with cell surface [[adrenergic receptors]]. Such stimuli result in a [[signal transduction]] cascade that leads to increased intracellular calcium from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] through [[Inositol triphosphate|IP3]] mediated calcium release, as well as enhanced calcium entry across the [[sarcolemma]] through [[calcium channels]]. The rise in intracellular calcium complexes with [[calmodulin]], which in turn activates [[myosin light chain kinase]]. This enzyme is responsible for [[phosphorylation|phosphorylating]] the light chain of [[myosin]] to stimulate cross bridge cycling.

Once elevated, the intracellular calcium concentration is returned to its basal level through a variety of protein pumps and calcium exchangers located on the plasma membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum. This reduction in calcium removes the stimulus necessary for contraction allowing for a return to baseline.

==Factors and individual mechanisms==
Factors that trigger vasoconstriction can be of exogenous or endogenous origin. Ambient temperature is an example of the former. Cutaneous vasoconstriction will occur because of the body's exposure to the severe cold. Examples of endogenous factors include the [[autonomic nervous system]], circulating hormones and intrinsic mechanisms inherent to the vasculature itself (also referred to as the [[myogenic]] response).

===Exogenous medications===
Examples include [[amphetamine]]s, [[antihistamine]]s and [[cocaine]]. Many are used in medicine to treat [[hypotension]] and as [[topical decongestant]]s. Vasoconstrictors are also used clinically to increase [[blood pressure]] or to reduce local blood flow. [[Local anesthetics and vasoconstrictors|Vasoconstrictors mixed with local anesthetics]] are used to increase the duration of local anesthesia by constricting the blood vessels, thereby safely concentrating the anesthetic agent for an extended duration, as well as reducing [[hemorrhage]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yagiela JA |title=Vasoconstrictor agents for local anesthesia |journal=Anesth Prog |volume=42 |issue=3–4 |pages=116–20 |year=1995 |pmid=8934977 |doi= |pmc=2148913}}</ref> 

The [[routes of administration]] varies. They may be both systemic and topical. For example, [[pseudoephedrine]] is available as a systemic (i.e. orally ingested tablets like [[Sudafed]]), and topical (such as nose sprays like phenylephrine [[Neo-synephrine]], and eye drops for [[pupil dilation]] purposes)

===Endogenous===
Vasoconstriction is a procedure of the body that avoids [[orthostatic hypotension]]. It is a part of a body negative feed back loop in which the body tries to restore homeostasis. 

For example, vasoconstriction is a hypothermic preventative in which the blood vessels constrict and blood must move at a higher pressure to actively avoid a hypoxic reaction. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is used as a form of energy to increase this pressure to heat the body. Once homeostasis is restored the blood pressure and ATP production regulates.

Vasoconstriction also occurs in superficial blood vessels of [[warm-blooded]] animals when their ambient environment is cold; this process diverts the flow of heated blood to the center of the animal, preventing the loss of heat.

==Pathology==
Vasoconstriction can be a contributing factor to [[erectile dysfunction]].<ref>Richard Milsten and Julian Slowinski, ''The sexual [[male]]'',bc,main point W.W. Norton Company, New York, London (1999) ISBN 0-393-04740-7</ref> An increase in blood flow to the penis causes an erection.

Improper vasoconstriction may also play a role in secondary [[hypertension]].
