'''Gastroschisis''' represents a congenital defect characterized by a defect in the anterior abdominal wall through which the abdominal contents freely protrude. There is no overlying sac and the size of the defect is usually less than 4&nbsp;cm. The abdominal wall defect is located at the junction of the umbilicus and normal skin, and is almost always to the right of the umbilicus.<ref>Schwartz's principles of surgery: self assessment and board review, 8th edition, chapter 38, page 278; textbook p.1493</ref> 

Widespread use of antenatal ultrasound examination and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening has made detection of gastroschisis possible in the second trimester of pregnancy.<ref name="pmid7681976">{{cite journal| author=Morrow RJ, Whittle MJ, McNay MB, Raine PA, Gibson AA, Crossley J| title=Prenatal diagnosis and management of anterior abdominal wall defects in the west of Scotland. | journal=Prenat Diagn | year= 1993 | volume= 13 | issue= 2 | pages= 111–5 | pmid=7681976 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=7681976  }}</ref>

[[Omphalocele]] is another congenital birth defect, but it involves the umbilical cord itself, and the organs remain enclosed in visceral peritoneum.  With omphalocele the defect is usually much larger than in gastroschisis.

== Causes ==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Gastroschisis has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[Biological inheritance|inheritance]].]]
High-risk pregnancies such as those complicated by infection, young maternal age, smoking, drug abuse, or anything that contributes to low birth weight can increase the incidence of gastroschisis, which is more frequent in newborns who are small for gestational age. Whether the intrauterine growth retardation can facilitate the apparition of gastroschisis or the abdominal wall defect impairs fetal growth is not clear yet. Numerous clinical studies have linked [[aspirin]], an [[FDA]] [[pregnancy category]] D drug, as an increased risk factor,<ref>http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/155/1/26.full.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11772781</ref><ref>http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/ShowRecord.asp?LinkFrom=OAI&ID=12009101330</ref> and according to large scale study by the [[California Department of Public Health]] aspirin quadruples the risk of Gastroschisis.<ref>http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/CBDMP/Documents/MO-CBDMP-Gastromedications.pdf</ref>

A change in paternity (childbearing with different fathers) has been implicated as a risk factor in a recent study, suggesting that the [[immune system]] of the mother may play a role in the development of gastroschisis.<ref name="pmid17163540">{{cite journal |last1=Chambers |first1=Christina D. |last2=Chen |first2=Brian H. |last3=Kalla |first3=Kristin |last4=Jernigan |first4=Laura |last5=Jones |first5=Kenneth Lyons |title=Novel risk factor in gastroschisis: Change of paternity |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |volume=143A |issue=7 |pages=653–659 |year=2007 |pmid=17163540 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31577}}</ref>

===Genetics===
Gastroschisis as a stand-alone congenital defect is usually inherited in an [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] manner. It may begin as a sporadic [[mutation]], can be associated with non-genetic congenital disorders, but has also been observed to be autosomal [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=Ping |last2=Beaty |first2=Terri H. |last3=Khoury |first3=Muin J. |last4=Chee |first4=Elsbeth |last5=Stewart |first5=Walter |last6=Gordis |first6=Leon |title=Genetic-epidemiologic study of omphalocele and gastroschisis: Evidence for heterogeneity |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=668–675 |year=1992 |pmid=1481831 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320440528}}</ref>

[[Genetic counseling]] and further [[genetic testing]], such as [[amniocentesis]], may be offered during the pregnancy, as this and other abdominal wall defects are associated with genetic disorders. If there are no additional genetic problems or birth defects, surgery soon after birth can often repair the opening.

At least six hypotheses have been proposed:
#Failure of mesoderm to form in the body wall<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duhamel |first1=B. |title=Embryology of Exomphalos and Allied Malformations |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |volume=38 |pages=142–7 |year=1963 |doi=10.1136/adc.38.198.142 |issue=198 |pmid=21032411 |pmc=2019006}}</ref>

#Abnormal involution of the right umbilical vein leading to weakening of the body wall and gut herniation<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Devries |first1=Pieter A. |title=The pathogenesis of gastroschisis and omphalocele |journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=245–51 |year=1980 |pmid=6445962 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3468(80)80130-8}}</ref>
#Disruption of the right vitelline (yolk sac) artery with subsequent body wall damage and gut herniation<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hoyme |first1=H |last2=Higginbottom |first2=M |last3=Jones |first3=K |title=The vascular pathogenesis of gastroschisis: Intrauterine interruption of the omphalomesenteric artery |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=228–31 |year=1981 |pmid=6450826 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(81)80640-3}}</ref>
#Abnormal folding of the body wall results in a ventral body wall defect through which the gut herniates<ref name=pmid17230493>{{cite journal |last1=Feldkamp |first1=Marcia L. |last2=Carey |first2=John C. |last3=Sadler |first3=Thomas W. |title=Development of gastroschisis: Review of hypotheses, a novel hypothesis, and implications for research |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |volume=143A |pages=639–52 |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31578 |issue=7}}</ref>

The first hypothesis does not explain why the mesoderm defect would occur in such a specific small area. The second hypothesis does not explain the low percentage of associated abnormality compared with omphalocele. The third hypothesis was criticized due to no vascular supplement of anterior abdominal wall by umbilical vein.  The fourth hypothesis was commonly accepted, but it was later shown that the right vitelline artery (right omphalomesenteric artery) did not supply the anterior abdominal wall in this area.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Cynthia |last1=Curry |first2=Ellen |last2=Boyd |first3=Roger E. |last3=Stevenson |chapter=Ventral Wall of the Trunk |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=_ssqN2gaDoUC&pg=PA1023 |year=2006 |editor1-first=Roger E. |editor1-last=Stevenson |editor2-first=Judith G. |editor2-last=Hall |title=Human Malformations and Related Anomalies |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |pages=1023–49 |isbn=978-0-19-516568-5}}</ref> More evidence is needed to support the fifth hypothesis.<ref name=pmid17230493/>

=== Embryology ===
During the fourth week of development, the lateral body folds move ventrally and fuse in the midline to form the anterior body wall. Incomplete fusion results in a defect that allows abdominal viscera to protrude through the abdominal wall. The bowel typically herniates through the rectus muscle, lying to the right of the umbilicus.

==Treatment==
Gastroschisis is a surgical emergency.<ref name=firstaidUSMLEstep2>{{cite book|last=Skelley|first=Tao Le, Vikas Bhushan, Nathan William|title=First aid for the USMLE step 2 CK|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=0071761373|pages=384|edition=8th ed.}}</ref> Patients frequently require more than one surgery; only about 10 percent of cases can be closed in a single surgery.<ref name=firstaidUSMLEstep2 />

The general procedure for gastroschisis is to simply tuck the protruding organs back into the opening and apply a belly band pressure until the wound heals itself. New advances have been pioneered in repairing the protruding bowel by placing a protective "silo" around the intestine outside the abdomen, then slowly pressuring the herniated intestine into the abdominal cavity. This new procedure allows for the bowel to return to its intended shape and location without further traumatizing the infant's viscera with undue internal pressure. The main cause for lengthy recovery periods in patients is the time taken for the infants' bowel function to return to normal.

== Prognosis ==
Current advances in surgical techniques and intensive care management for neonates have increased the survival rate to 90%,<ref name="pmid17766615">{{cite journal| author=Santiago-Munoz PC, McIntire DD, Barber RG, Megison SM, Twickler DM, Dashe JS| title=Outcomes of pregnancies with fetal gastroschisis. | journal=Obstet Gynecol | year= 2007 | volume= 110 | issue= 3 | pages= 663–8 | pmid=17766615 | doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000277264.63736.7e | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=17766615  }}</ref><ref name="pmid12720191">{{cite journal| author=Baerg J, Kaban G, Tonita J, Pahwa P, Reid D| title=Gastroschisis: A sixteen-year review. | journal=J Pediatr Surg | year= 2003 | volume= 38 | issue= 5 | pages= 771–4 | pmid=12720191 | doi=10.1016/jpsu.2003.50164 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=12720191  }}</ref> in adequate settings. The possibility of prenatal diagnosis either through echosonogram or any other method available allows the mother to be referred to an adequate center where a caesarean section or induced natural birth can be performed before term (as natural birth is recommended and just as safe as with a normal baby), preferably within 2 weeks of term, and allow the immediate surgery to be performed on the newborn.

The morbidity is closely related to the presence of other malformations and complications of the wound or the intestine.

== Epidemiology ==
The malformation is slightly more frequent in males than females. The frequency of gastroschisis is associated with young maternal age, low number of gestations, alcohol, tobacco and [[NSAID]] use, and infections. This abnormality was historically reported as having a ratio of 1:10,000 and is usually detected before birth. It has been reported that the incidence of gastroschisis has increased in recent years.<ref name="pmid17230493">{{cite journal |last1=Feldkamp |first1=Marcia L. |last2=Carey |first2=John C. |last3=Sadler |first3=Thomas W. |title=Development of gastroschisis: Review of hypotheses, a novel hypothesis, and implications for research |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |volume=143A |pages=639–652 |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31578 |issue=7}}</ref> The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] currently estimates that about 1,871 babies are born each year in the United States with gastroschisis. <ref>http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/gastroschisis.html</ref>

There is an increased incidence when the mother has a history of cigarette smoking, use of recreational drugs, alcohol consumption, low body mass index, increased frequency of genitourinary infection.<ref name="pmid19635303">{{cite journal| author=Mac Bird T, Robbins JM, Druschel C, Cleves MA, Yang S, Hobbs CA et al.| title=Demographic and environmental risk factors for gastroschisis and omphalocele in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. | journal=J Pediatr Surg | year= 2009 | volume= 44 | issue= 8 | pages= 1546–51 | pmid=19635303 | doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2008.10.109 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=19635303  }}</ref><ref name="pmid18558637">{{cite journal| author=Mastroiacovo P| title=Risk factors for gastroschisis. | journal=BMJ | year= 2008 | volume= 336 | issue= 7658 | pages= 1386–7 | pmid=18558637 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39577.589699.BE | pmc=2432124 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18558640">{{cite journal| author=Feldkamp ML, Reefhuis J, Kucik J, Krikov S, Wilson A, Moore CA et al.| title=Case-control study of self reported genitourinary infections and risk of gastroschisis: findings from the national birth defects prevention study, 1997-2003. | journal=BMJ | year= 2008 | volume= 336 | issue= 7658 | pages= 1420–3 | pmid=18558640 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39567.509074.25 | pmc=2432171 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18063593">{{cite journal| author=Draper ES, Rankin J, Tonks AM, Abrams KR, Field DJ, Clarke M et al.| title=Recreational drug use: a major risk factor for gastroschisis? | journal=Am J Epidemiol | year= 2008 | volume= 167 | issue= 4 | pages= 485–91 | pmid=18063593 | doi=10.1093/aje/kwm335 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=18063593  }}</ref><ref name="pmid17679655">{{cite journal| author=Waller DK, Shaw GM, Rasmussen SA, Hobbs CA, Canfield MA, Siega-Riz AM et al.| title=Prepregnancy obesity as a risk factor for structural birth defects. | journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med | year= 2007 | volume= 161 | issue= 8 | pages= 745–50 | pmid=17679655 | doi=10.1001/archpedi.161.8.745 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=17679655  }}</ref><ref name="pmid9532995">{{cite journal| author=Penman DG, Fisher RM, Noblett HR, Soothill PW| title=Increase in incidence of gastroschisis in the south west of England in 1995. | journal=Br J Obstet Gynaecol | year= 1998 | volume= 105 | issue= 3 | pages= 328–31 | pmid=9532995 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=9532995  }}</ref><ref name="pmid14526310">{{cite journal| author=Reid KP, Dickinson JE, Doherty DA| title=The epidemiologic incidence of congenital gastroschisis in Western Australia. | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | year= 2003 | volume= 189 | issue= 3 | pages= 764–8 | pmid=14526310 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=14526310  }}</ref>
