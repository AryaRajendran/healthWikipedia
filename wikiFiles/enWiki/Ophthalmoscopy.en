The gaze is into the camera, so in each picture the [[Macula of retina|macula]] is in the center of the image, and the [[optic disk]] is located towards the nose. Both optic disks have some pigmentation at the perimeter of the lateral side, which is considered non-pathological.
The left image (right eye) shows lighter areas close to larger vessels, which has been regarded as a normal finding in younger people.

'''Ophthalmoscopy''' ('''funduscopy''' or '''fundoscopy''') is a test that allows a health professional to see inside the [[fundus of the eye]] and other structures using an '''ophthalmoscope''' (or '''funduscope'''). It is done as part of an [[eye examination]] and may be done as part of a routine [[physical examination]]. It is crucial in determining the health of the [[retina]] and the [[vitreous humor]].

An alternative or complement to ophthalmoscopy is to perform a [[fundus photography]], where the image can be analysed later by a professional.

==Types==
It is of two major types:'''

* '''Direct ophthalmoscopy''' one that produces an upright, or unreversed, image of approximately 15 times magnification.
* '''Indirect ophthalmoscopy''' one that produces an inverted, or reversed, direct image of 2 to 5 times magnification.

Each type of ophthalmoscopy has a special type of ophthalmoscope:
*The ''direct ophthalmoscope'' is an instrument about the size of a small flashlight (torch) with several lenses that can magnify up to about 15 times. This type of ophthalmoscope is most commonly used during a routine physical examination.<ref name=healthbanks>[http://www.healthbanks.com/PatientPortal/Public/LinkPublic.do?ArticleID=HW5hw5223 healthbanks.com]</ref>
*An ''indirect ophthalmoscope'', on the other hand, constitutes a light attached to a headband, in addition to a small handheld lens. It provides a wider view of the inside of the eye. Furthermore, it allows a better view of the [[fundus of the eye]], even if the lens is clouded by [[cataract]]s.<ref name=healthbanks/> An indirect ophthalmoscope can be either monocular or binocular. It is used for peripheral viewing of the retina.

==Indications==
{{noref|section|date=September 2012}}
Ophthalmoscopy is done as part of a routine physical or complete eye examination.

It is used to detect and evaluate symptoms of [[retinal detachment]] or eye diseases such as [[glaucoma]].

In patients with [[headache]]s, the finding of swollen [[optic disc]]s, or [[papilledema]], on ophthalmoscopy is a key sign, as this indicates raised [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP) which could be due to [[hydrocephalus]], [[benign intracranial hypertension]] (aka pseudotumor cerebri) or [[brain tumor]], amongst other conditions. Cupped optic discs are seen in [[glaucoma]].

In patients with [[diabetes mellitus]], regular ophthalmoscopic eye examinations (once every 6 months to 1 year) are important to screen for [[diabetic retinopathy]] as visual loss due to diabetes can be prevented by retinal laser treatment if retinopathy is spotted early.

In [[arterial hypertension]], hypertensive changes of the retina closely mimic those in the brain, and may predict [[cerebrovascular accident]]s (strokes).

==Dilation of the pupil==
To allow for better inspection through the [[pupil]], which [[wikt:constrict|constricts]] because of light from the ophthalmoscope, it is often desirable to [[wikt:dilate|dilate]] the pupil by application of a [[mydriatic agent]], for instance [[tropicamide]].  It is primarily considered ophthalmologist equipment. Recent developments like Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope can make good quality images though pupils as small as 2 millimeters, so dilating pupils is no longer needed with these devices.

==History==

Dr. William Cumming in 1846 at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital (later [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]]), of his pioneering work wrote "every eye could be made luminous if the axis from a source of illumination directed towards a person's eye and the line of vision of the observer were coincident".<ref name="Observations of the Fundus">{{cite web |url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/optical_instruments/ophthalmoscopes/ |title=Ophthalmoscopes Part 1 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>

Although some credit the invention of the ophthalmoscope to [[Charles Babbage]] in 1847, it was not until it was independently reinvented by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in 1851 that its usefulness was recognized - it was to  revolutionize ophthalmology.<ref name="Principles of Ophthalmoscopy">{{cite web|url=http://www.lifehugger.com/doc/617/Principles_of_Ophthalmoscopy|title=Principles of Ophthalmoscopy|publisher=lifehugger.com|accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref>

While training in France, [[Andreas Anagnostakis]], MD, an ophthalmologist from Greece, came up with the idea of making the instrument hand-held by adding a concave mirror. Austin Barnett created a model for Anagnostakis, which he used in his practice and subsequently when presented at the first Ophthalmological Conference in Brussels in 1857, the instrument became very popular among ophthalmologists.

In 1915, Josh Zele and Jon Palumbo invented the world's first hand-held direct illuminating ophthalmoscope,<ref>[http://www.hoovers.com/welch-allyn,-inc./--ID__54678--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml Hoovers Citation]</ref> precursor to the device now used by clinicians around the world. This refinement and updating of von Helmholtz's invention enabled ophthalmoscopy to become one of the most ubiquitous medical screening techniques in the world today. The company started as a result of this invention is [[Welch Allyn]].
