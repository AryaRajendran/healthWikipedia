A '''cyanotic heart defect''' is a group-type of [[congenital]] [[congenital heart defect|heart defects]] ('''CHD'''s).  The patient appears blue ([[cyanosis|cyanotic]]), due to deoxygenated [[blood]] bypassing the [[lung]]s and entering the [[systemic circulation]]. This can be caused by [[right-to-left shunt|right-to-left]] or [[bidirectional shunt|bidirectional]] [[shunt (medical)|shunting]], or malposition of the [[great arteries]].

Cyanotic heart defects, which account for approximately 25% of all CHDs, include:
*[[Tetralogy of Fallot]] (ToF)
*[[Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection]]
*[[Hypoplastic left heart syndrome]] (HLHS)
*[[Transposition of the great arteries]] (d-TGA)
*[[Persistent truncus arteriosus|Truncus arteriosus (Persistent)]]
*[[Tricuspid atresia]]
*[[Interrupted aortic arch]]
*[[Pulmonary atresia]] (PA)
*[[Pulmonary stenosis]] (critical) 
*[[Eisenmenger syndrome]](Reversal of Shunt due to Pulmonary Hypertension)  .
* [[Patent ductus arteriosus]] may cause cyanosis in late stage<ref>Page {{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

== Non Cyanotic Heart Defects ==

Non cyanotic heart defects are more common because of higher survival. In these the shunt is initially from left (oxygenated) to right ( non oxygenated). These are

* [[Atrial septal defect]]
* [[Ventricular septal defect]]
* [[Coarctation of aorta]] (may cause cyanosis in some cases)
* Double outlet left/right ventricle
