'''Toxaphene''' is an insecticide.  It is a mixture of closely related substances whose use is now banned in most of the world due to concerns of toxicity.

==Composition==
Toxaphene is a mixture of approximately 200 [[organic compound]]s, formed by the [[halogenation|chlorination]] of [[camphene]] (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>) to an overall chlorine content of 67-69% by weight.<ref>Saleh, Mahmoud Abbas; Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 1983, vol. 31, pp 748-751.</ref><ref>Buntin, G.A.  U.S. Patent 2,565,471, 1951.</ref>  The bulk of the compounds (mostly chlorobornanes, chlorocamphenes, and other [[bicyclic]] chloroorganic compounds) found in toxaphene have [[chemical formula]]s ranging from C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>11</sub>Cl<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub>, with a mean formula of C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>.<ref>Buser, Hans-Rudolf; et al., Chemosphere, 2000, vol. 40, pp 1213-1220.</ref>  The formula weights of these compounds range from 308 to 551 grams/mole; the theoretical mean formula has a value of 414 grams/mole.  Toxaphene is usually seen as a yellow to amber waxy [[solid]].  It is volatile enough to be transported for long distances through the atmosphere.<ref>Shoeib, Mahiba; et al., Chemosphere, 1999, vol. 39, pp 849-871.</ref><ref>Rice, Clifford P.; et al., Environmental Science and Technology, 1986, vol. 20, pp 1109-1116.</ref>

==Health effects==
When inhaled or ingested, sufficient quantities of toxaphene can damage the [[lungs]], [[nervous system]], and [[kidneys]], and may cause [[death]]. It is classified as an [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|IARC Group 2B carcinogen]].

==Applications==
Toxaphene was used as an [[insecticide]].  In the U.S., it was chiefly used in the cotton and soybean growing areas in the southeastern region.  It was used to treat [[mange]] in cattle in [[California]] in the 1970s, although there were reports of cattle deaths following spraying with toxaphene.<ref>Chancellor, John; Oliver, Don (1979-02-22).

In 1982, it was banned for most uses, and in 1990 it was banned for all uses in the [[United States]].<ref>http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/toxaphene.cfm</ref>  It belongs to the so-called "[[dirty dozen (Stockholm Convention)|dirty dozen]]", a list of very [[toxic substance]]s, eleven of which were outlawed in May 2004 when the [[Stockholm Convention]] went into effect.<ref>http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/docs/publications/sc_factsheet_004.pdf.
