[[biologist]], [[zoologist]] and [[protozoologist]], best remembered for his pioneering research into the [[immune system]]. Mechnikov received the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 1908, shared with [[Paul Ehrlich]], for his work on [[phagocytosis]]. He is also credited by some sources with coining the term [[gerontology]] in 1903, for the emerging study of aging and longevity.

==Biography==
Mechnikov was born in a village Ivanovka near [[Kharkov]], [[Russian Empire]] (modern Ukraine) the youngest son of Ilya Mechnikov, a Guard officer, and  Emilia Mechnikova (née Nevakhovich). His maternal grandfather [[Lev Nevakhovich]] was the first Russo-Jewish writer and founder of the [[Haskala]] movement in Russia. The family name Mechnikov is a translation from [[Romanian Language|Romanian]], since his father was a descendant of the Chancellor [[Yuri Stefanovich Spătarul|Yuri Stefanovich]], the grandson of [[Nicolae Milescu]]. The word "mech" is a Russian translation of the Romanian "spadă" (sword), which originated with [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|Spătar]]. His elder brother Lev became a prominent geographer and sociologist. Mechnikov developed a passion for [[natural history]]. When [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was published, Ilya vehemently undertook the [[survival of the fittest]], testing and teaching it.

He attended [[Kharkiv University]] where he studied [[natural sciences]], completing his four-year degree in two years. He then went to [[Germany]] to study marine [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] on the small [[North Sea]] island of [[Heligoland]] and then at the [[University of Giessen]], [[University of Göttingen]] and then at [[Munich Academy]]. In 1867 he returned to [[Russia]] to the appointment of [[docent]] at the newly established [[Odessa University|Imperial Novorossiya University]] (now [[Odessa University]]), followed by an appointment at the [[University of St. Petersburg]]. In 1870 he returned to [[Odessa]] to take up the appointment of Titular Professor of [[Zoology]] and [[Comparative Anatomy]].

Mechnikov became interested in the study of [[microbes]], and especially the [[immune system]]. In 1882 he resigned his position at Odessa University and set up a private laboratory at [[Messina]] to study comparative [[embryology]], where he discovered [[phagocytosis]] after experimenting on the [[larva]]e of [[starfish]]. He realized that the process of digestion in micro-organisms was essentially the same as that carried out by white blood cells. His theory, that certain [[white blood cell]]s could engulf and destroy harmful bodies such as bacteria, met with scepticism from leading specialists including [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Emil Adolf von Behring|Behring]] and others. At the time most bacteriologists believed that white blood cells ingested pathogens and then spread them further through the body. 

Mechnikov returned to [[Odessa]] as director of an institute set up to carry out Pasteur's [[vaccine]] against [[rabies]], but due to some difficulties left in 1888 and went to [[Paris]] to seek Pasteur's advice. Pasteur gave him an appointment at the [[Pasteur Institute]], where he remained for the rest of his life.

Mechnikov's work on [[phagocytes]] won him the Nobel Prize in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1908 Ilya Mechnikov, Paul Ehrlich|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref> He worked with [[Pierre Paul Emile Roux|Émile Roux]] on [[calomel]], an ointment to prevent people from contracting [[syphilis]], a [[sexually transmitted disease]].

Mechnikov also developed a theory that [[senescence|aging]] is caused by toxic bacteria in the gut and that [[lactic acid]] could prolong life. Based on this theory, he drank [[yogurt|sour milk]] every day. He wrote three books: ''Immunity in Infectious Diseases, The Nature of Man'', and ''The Prolongation of Life: Optimistic Studies'', the last of which, along with Metchnikoff's studies into the potential life-lengthening properties of lactic acid bacteria ([[Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus]]), inspired Japanese scientist [[Minoru Shirota]] to begin investigating the causal relationship between bacteria and good intestinal health, which eventually led to the worldwide marketing of [[Kefir]] and other [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] [[milk]] drinks, or [[probiotics]].

===Death===
Mechnikov died in 1916 in [[Paris]] from heart failure.<ref>{{cite news |author=B. I.

==Personal life==
Mechnikov was married to his first wife Ludmila Feodorovitch in 1863. She died from [[tuberculosis]] on 20 April 1873. Her death, combined with other problems, caused Mechnikov to unsuccessfully [[attempted suicide|attempt suicide]], taking a large dose of [[opium]]. He married again in 1875, to Olga Belokopytova who died in 1944 in Paris from [[typhoid]].
