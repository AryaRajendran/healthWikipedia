As well as helping with the medical needs of people affected by cancer, Macmillan also looks at the social, emotional and practical impact cancer can have, and campaigns for better [[Oncology|cancer care]]. Macmillan Cancer Support's goal is to reach and improve the lives of everyone living with cancer in the UK.

==History==
The charity was founded, as the ''Society for the Prevention and Relief of Cancer'', in 1911 by [[Douglas Macmillan]] following the death of his father from the disease. In 1924 the name was changed to the ''National Society for Cancer Relief'', which it retained until 1989 when it was changed to ''Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund'', later changed again to ''Macmillan Cancer Relief''. From 5 April 2006 Macmillan Cancer Relief became known as ''Macmillan Cancer Support'' as this more accurately reflects its role in supporting people living with cancer. It has adopted the principles of being a "source of support" and a "force for change". 

Douglas Macmillan was a vegetarian. In 1909, he wrote an open letter to all Christians entitled ''Shall We Slay'' which encouraged orthodox Christians to consider vegetarianism.<ref>[http://www.articles.homecall.co.uk/hvg104shallweslay/ Shall We Slay]</ref>

As the ''National Society for Cancer Relief'', the organization provided funding to support the work of the ''Breast Care and Mastectomy Association of Great Britain'' which would later become [[Breast Cancer Care]].
