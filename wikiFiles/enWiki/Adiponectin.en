'''Adiponectin''' (also referred to as '''GBP-28''', '''apM1''', '''AdipoQ''' and '''Acrp30''') is a [[protein]] which in humans is encoded by the ''ADIPOQ'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid8619847">{{cite journal | author = Maeda K, Okubo K, Shimomura I, Funahashi T, Matsuzawa Y, Matsubara K | title = cDNA cloning and expression of a novel adipose specific collagen-like factor, apM1 (AdiPose Most abundant Gene transcript 1) | journal = Biochem.

== Structure  ==

Adiponectin is a 244-amino-acid-long polypeptide. There are four distinct regions of adiponectin. The first is a short signal sequence that targets the hormone for secretion outside the cell; next is a short region that varies between species; the third is a 65-amino acid region with similarity to collagenous proteins; the last is a globular domain. Overall this gene shows similarity to the complement 1Q factors ([[C1q|C1Q]]). However, when the 3-dimensional structure of the globular region was determined, a striking similarity to [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNFα]] was observed, despite unrelated protein sequences.<ref name="pmid9512423">{{cite journal | author = Shapiro L, Scherer PE | title = The crystal structure of a complement-1q family protein suggests an evolutionary link to tumor necrosis factor | journal = Curr.

== Function ==
Adiponectin is a protein [[hormone]] that modulates a number of metabolic processes, including [[glucose]] regulation and [[fatty acid]] [[oxidation]].<ref name="pmid12611609">{{cite journal | author = Díez JJ, Iglesias P | title = The role of the novel adipocyte-derived hormone adiponectin in human disease | journal = Eur.

Adiponectin is secreted into the bloodstream where it accounts for approximately 0.01% of all plasma protein at around 5-10 μg/mL. Plasma concentrations reveal a [[sexual dimorphism]], with females having higher levels than males. Levels of adiponectin are reduced in diabetics compared to non-diabetics. Weight reduction significantly increases circulating levels.<ref name="pmid18378021">{{cite journal | author = Coppola A, Marfella R, Coppola L, Tagliamonte E, Fontana D, Liguori E, Cirillo T, Cafiero M, Natale S, Astarita C | title = Effect of weight loss on coronary circulation and adiponectin levels in obese women | journal = Int.

Adiponectin automatically self-associates into larger structures. Initially, three adiponectin molecules bind together to form a homotrimer. The [[Protein trimer|trimer]]s continue to self-associate and form hexamers or dodecamers. Like the plasma concentration, the relative levels of the higher-order structures are sexually dimorphic, where females have increased proportions of the high-molecular weight forms. Recent studies showed that the high-molecular weight form may be the most biologically active form regarding glucose homeostasis.<ref>Oh DK, Ciaraldi T, Henry RR Adiponectin in health and disease.

Adiponectin exerts some of its weight reduction effects via the [[brain]]. This is similar to the action of '''[[leptin]]''',<ref name="pmid15544426">{{cite journal | author = Nedvídková J, Smitka K, Kopský V, Hainer V | title = Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived protein | journal = Physiol Res | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–40 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15544426 | doi = | url = http://www.biomed.cas.cz/physiolres/pdf/54/54_133.pdf }}</ref> but the two hormones perform complementary actions, and can have additive effects.

== Receptors ==

Adiponectin binds to a number of receptors. So far, two [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] have been identified, with [[Homology (biology)|homology]] to [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s and one receptor similar to the cadherin family:<ref name="pmid12802337">{{cite journal | author = Yamauchi T, Kamon J, Ito Y, Tsuchida A, Yokomizo T, Kita S, Sugiyama T, Miyagishi M, Hara K, Tsunoda M, Murakami K, Ohteki T, Uchida S, Takekawa S, Waki H, Tsuno NH, Shibata Y, Terauchi Y, Froguel P, Tobe K, Koyasu S, Taira K, Kitamura T, Shimizu T, Nagai R, Kadowaki T | title = Cloning of adiponectin receptors that mediate antidiabetic metabolic effects | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6941 | pages = 762–9 | year = 2003 | month = June | pmid = 12802337 | doi = 10.1038/nature01705  }}</ref><ref name="pmid15210937">{{cite journal | author = Hug C, Wang J, Ahmad NS, Bogan JS, TSao TS, Lodish HF | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 101 | issue = 28 | pages = 10308–13 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15210937 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0403382101 | title = T-cadherin is a receptor for hexameric and high-molecular-weight forms of Acrp30/adiponectin  | pmc = 478568 }}</ref>

These have distinct tissue specificities within the body and have different affinities to the various forms of adiponectin. The receptors affect the downstream target [[AMP-activated protein kinase|AMP kinase]], an important cellular metabolic rate control point. Expression of the receptors is correlated with insulin levels, as well as reduced in mouse models of diabetes, particularly in [[skeletal muscle]] and adipose tissue.<ref name="pmid17052201">{{cite journal | author = Fang X, Sweeney G | title = Mechanisms regulating energy metabolism by adiponectin in obesity and diabetes | journal = Biochem.

Adiponectin was first characterised in 1996 in mice as the mRNA transcript most hightly expressed in adipocytes.(Maeda, 1996 ((citation #1, below)))  In 2007, adiponectin was identified as an [[mRNA|transcript]] highly expressed in preadipocytes<ref name="pmid17495599">{{cite journal | author = Lara-Castro C, Fu Y, Chung BH, Garvey WT | title = Adiponectin and the metabolic syndrome: mechanisms mediating risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disease | journal = Curr.

The human homologue was identified as the most abundant transcript in adipose tissue. Contrary to expectations, despite being produced in [[adipose tissue]], adiponectin was found to be decreased in [[obesity]].<ref name="pmid12611609"/><ref name="pmid12436346"/><ref name="pmid15544426"/> This downregulation has not been fully explained. The gene was localised to chromosome 3q27, a region highlighted as affecting genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and obesity. Supplementation by differing forms of adiponectin were able to improve [[insulin]] control, blood glucose and triglyceride levels in mouse models.
