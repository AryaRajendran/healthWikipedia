The mainstay of '''[[breast cancer]] treatment''' is [[surgery]] when the tumor is localized, followed by [[chemotherapy]] (when indicated), [[radiotherapy]] and [[adjuvant]] [[hormonal therapy]] for ER positive tumours (with [[tamoxifen]] or an [[aromatase inhibitor]]). Management of breast cancer is undertaken by a multidisciplinary team based on national and international guidelines. Depending on clinical criteria (age, type of cancer, size, metastasis) patients are roughly divided to high risk and low risk cases, with each risk category following different rules for therapy. Treatment possibilities include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and immune therapy.

==Staging==
A patient generally first goes through a [[Breast cancer#Classification|staging process]] to see if s/he can benefit from local treatment. Staging makes use of clinical, imaging and pathological assessment to make a best guess by the physician. If the cancer has spread beyond the breast and the [[lymph node]]s then it is classified as Stage 4 or [[metastatic cancer]] and requires mostly systemic treatment.

[[Specialty (medicine)|Medical specialty]] [[professional organizations]] recommend against a physician's use of [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], or [[Bone scintigraphy|bone scans]] when staging early breast cancer with low risk for metastasis.<ref name="ASCOfive">{{Citation |author1 = American Society of Clinical Oncology |author1-link = American Society of Clinical Oncology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |accessdate = August 14, 2012}}</ref><ref name="CarlsonBreast">{{cite PMID|19200416}}</ref> The rationale is that there is no evidence which shows that extra testing results in better outcomes for a patient, but a patient who does receive tests against the consensus of professionals in the field is more likely to receive invasive procedures, [[overutilization]] of medical services, unnecessary radiation exposure, and experience misdiagnosis.<ref name="ASCOfive"/><ref name="CarlsonBreast"/>

==Surgery==
[[Image:Breast cancer.JPG|thumb| Excised breast tissue showing a stellate, pale area of cancer measuring 2 cm across. The tumor could be felt as a hard, mobile lump before the surgical excision.]]
Depending on the staging and type of the tumor, just a [[lumpectomy]] (removal of the lump only) may be all that is necessary, or removal of larger amounts of breast tissue may be necessary. Surgical removal of the entire breast is called [[mastectomy]].

Lumpectomy techniques are increasingly utilized for breast-conservation cancer surgery. Studies indicate that for patients with a single tumor smaller than 4&nbsp;cm, lumpectomy may be as effective as a mastectomy.<ref>[http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/mast_vs_lump.jsp Decision guide for patients deciding mastectomy vs lumpectomy]</ref> Prior to a lumpectomy, a [[needle-localized biopsy|needle-localization]] of the lesion with placement of a guidewire may be performed, sometimes by a [[radiologist]] if the area being removed was detected by [[mammography]] or [[ultrasound]], and sometimes by the [[surgeon]] if the lesion can be directly palpated.

However, mastectomy may be the preferred treatment in certain instances:

* Two or more tumors exist in different areas of the breast (a "multifocal" cancer).
* The breast has previously received radiotherapy.
* The tumor is large relative to the size of the breast.
* The patient has had [[scleroderma]] or another disease of the connective tissue, which can complicate radiotherapy.
* The patient lives in an area where radiotherapy is inaccessible.
* The patient is apprehensive about the risk of local recurrence after lumpectomy.

Standard practice requires the surgeon to establish that the tissue removed in the operation has margins clear of cancer, indicating that the cancer has been completely excised. If the removed tissue does not have clear margins, further operations to remove more tissue may be necessary. This may sometimes require removal of part of the [[pectoralis major muscle]], which is the main muscle of the anterior chest wall.

During the operation, the [[lymph node]]s in the [[axilla]] are also considered for removal. In the past, large axillary operations took out 10 to 40 nodes to establish whether cancer had spread. This had the unfortunate side effect of frequently causing [[lymphedema]] of the arm on the same side, as the removal of this many lymph nodes affected lymphatic drainage. More recently, the technique of [[sentinel lymph node]] (SLN) dissection has become popular, as it requires the removal of far fewer lymph nodes, resulting in fewer side effects. The sentinel lymph node is the first node that drains the tumor, and subsequent SLN mapping can save 65-70% of patients with breast cancer from having a complete lymph node dissection for what could turn out to be a negative nodal basin. Advances in Sentinel Lymph Node mapping over the past decade have increased the accuracy of detecting Sentinel Lymph Node from 80% using blue dye alone to between 92% and 98% using combined modalities.<ref name=Bennett_2006>{{cite journal | author = | title = Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Breast Cancer and Melanoma | journal = Oncology Issues | year = 2006 | volume = March/April | pages = 22&ndash;5 | url = http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/1948/bennet_edit.pdf| format =  &ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&q=%22Sentinel+Lymph+Node+Biopsy++for+Breast+Cancer+and+Melanoma%22&btnG=Search&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_ylo=&as_vis=0 Google scholar]</sup> }}</ref> SLN biopsy is indicated for patients with T1 and T2 lesions (<5&nbsp;cm) and carries a number of recommendations for use on patient subgroups.<ref name=Bennett_2006/> Recent trends continue to favor less radical axillar node resection even in the presence of some metastases in the sentinel node.<ref name="Guiliano_2011">{{cite pmid|21304082}}</ref>

===Live tissue samples for testing===
Recently{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} live tissue samples from surgery are tested with various chemotherapy agents to derive probabilities of which ones may work better and especially the ones which would not work (cell-death assays). The companies need the sample within 24 hours of surgical excision. This is especially useful{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} for early stage cancers where a response for the therapy cannot be determined once the whole cancer is taken out during the surgery and the chemotherapy is given in an adjuciant setting. However, the benefits of such tests have not yet been established in clinical trials and is not mainstream.

===Lymphedema===
Some patients develop [[lymphedema]], as a result of axillary node dissection or of radiation treatment to the lymph nodes.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002106/#adam_001117.disease.causes NIH summary of lymphedema condition]</ref> Although traditional recommendations limited exercise, a new study shows that participating in a safe, structured weight-lifting routine can help women with lymphedema take control of their symptoms and reap the many rewards that resistance training has on their overall health as they begin life as a cancer survivor. It recommends that women start with a slowly progressive program, supervised by a certified fitness professional, in order to learn how to do these types of exercises properly. Women with lymphedema should also wear a well-fitting compression garment during all exercise sessions.[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/160540.php]

==Radiation therapy==
Radiation therapy is an [[adjuvant]] treatment for most women who have undergone lumpectomy and for some women who have mastectomy surgery. In these cases the purpose of radiation is to reduce the chance that the cancer will recur. Radiation therapy involves using high-energy X-rays or [[gamma ray]]s that target a tumor or post surgery tumor site. This radiation is very effective in killing cancer cells that may remain after surgery or recur where the tumor was removed.

Radiation therapy can be delivered by either [[external beam radiotherapy]] or [[brachytherapy]] (internal radiotherapy). In the case of external beam radiotherapy, X-rays are delivered from outside the body by a machine called a [[Linear particle accelerator|Linear Accelerator]] or Linac. In contrast, brachytherapy involves the precise placement of radiation source(s) directly at the treatment site. Radiation therapy for breast cancer is usually performed after surgery and is an integral component of breast-conserving therapy.

Radiation therapy eliminates the microscopic cancer cells that may remain near the area where the tumor was surgically removed. The dose of radiation must be strong enough to ensure the elimination of cancer cells. However, radiation affects normal cells and cancer cells alike, causing some damage to the normal tissue around where the tumor was. Healthy tissue can repair itself, while cancer cells do not repair themselves as well as normal cells. For this reason, radiation treatments are given over an extended period, enabling the healthy tissue to heal. Treatments using external beam radiotherapy are typically given over a period of five to seven weeks, performed five days a week. Each treatment takes about 15 minutes. A newer approach, called 'accelerated partial breast irradiation' (APBI), uses brachytherapy to deliver the radiation in a much shorter period of time. APBI delivers radiation to only the immediate region surrounding the original tumor<ref name="Nelson-2009">{{Cite pmid|19268900}}</ref><ref name="Keisch-ABS">

Although radiation therapy can reduce the chance of breast cancer recurrence, it is much less effective in prolonging patient survival. According to a review of six studies by the United States' [[National Cancer Institute]], none of them found a survival benefit for radiation therapy.<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/breast/HealthProfessional/page7#Section_251 cancer.gov]</ref> Patients who are unable to have radiation therapy after lumpectomy should consult with a surgeon who understands this research and who believes that lumpectomy (or partial mastectomy) alone is a reasonable treatment option.

===Indications for radiation===
Radiation treatment is mainly effective in reducing the risk of local relapse in the affected breast. Therefore it is recommended in most cases of breast conserving surgeries and less frequently after mastectomy. Indications for radiation treatment are constantly evolving. Patients treated in Europe have been more likely in the past to be recommended adjuvant radiation after breast cancer surgery as compared to patients in North America. [[Radiation therapy]] is usually recommended for all patients who had [[lumpectomy]], quadrant-resection. Radiation therapy is usually not indicated in patients with advanced (stage IV disease) except for palliation of symptoms like bone pain or [[fungating lesion]]s.

In general recommendations would include radiation:
*As part of breast conserving therapy.
*After mastectomy for patients with higher risk of recurrence because of conditions such as a large primary [[tumor]] or substantial involvement of the [[lymph node]]s.<ref>http://www.rtanswers.org/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/breast/radiationaftermasectomy.aspx</ref>

Other factors which may influence adding adjuvant radiation therapy:
*Tumor close to or involving the margins on pathology specimen
*Multiple areas of tumor (multicentric disease)
*Microscopic invasion of lymphatic or vascular tissues
*Microcopic invasion of the skin, nipple/areola, or underlying pectoralis major muscle
*Patients with extension out of the substance of a LN
*Inadequate numbers of axillary LN sampled

===Types of radiotherapy===
[[File:SAVI 6-1mini open purple.jpg|thumb|150px|The SAVI applicator is a multiple catheter breast brachytherapy device.]]
{{See also|Brachytherapy}}

Radiotherapy can be delivered in many ways but is most commonly produced by a linear accelerator.

This usually involves treating the whole breast in the case of breast lumpectomy or the whole chest wall in the case of mastectomy. Lumpectomy patients with early-stage breast cancer may be eligible for a newer, shorter form of treatment called "breast [[brachytherapy]]". This approach allows physicians to treat only part of the breast in order to spare healthy tissue from unnecessary radiation.

Improvements in computers and treatment delivery technology have led to more complex radiotherapy treatment options. One such new technology is using IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy), which can change the shape and intensity of the radiation beam making "beamlets" at different points across and inside the breast. This allows for better dose distribution within the breast while minimizing dose to healthy organs such as the lung or heart.<ref>http://www.rtanswers.org/treatmentinformation/treatmenttypes/externalbeamradiation.aspx</ref> However there is yet to be a demonstrated difference in treatment outcomes (both tumor recurrence and level of side effects) for IMRT in breast cancer when compared to conventional radiotherapy treatment. In addition, conventional radiotherapy can also deliver similar dose distributions utilizing modern computer [[dosimetry]] planning and equipment. External beam radiation therapy treatments for breast cancer are typically given every day, five days a week, for five to 10 weeks.<ref>http://www.rtanswers.org/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/breast/externalbeam.aspx</ref>

Within the past decade, a new approach called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has gained popularity. APBI is used to deliver radiation as part of breast conservation therapy. It treats only the area where the tumor was surgically removed, plus adjacent tissue. APBI reduces the length of treatment to just five days, compared to the typical six or seven weeks for whole breast irradiation.

APBI treatments can be given as brachytherapy or external beam with a linear accelerator. These treatments are usually limited to women with well-defined tumors that have not spread.<ref>http://www.rtanswers.org/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/breast/accelerated.aspx</ref>

In breast brachytherapy, the radiation source is placed inside the breast, treating the cavity from the inside out. There are several different devices that deliver breast brachytherapy. Some use a single [[catheter]] and balloon to deliver the radiation. Other devices utilize multiple catheters to deliver radiation.

A study is currently underway by the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) to determine whether limiting radiation therapy to only the tumor site following lumpectomy is as effective as radiating the whole breast.

New technology has also allowed more precise delivery of radiotherapy in a portable fashion &mdash; for example in the operating theatre. Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT)<ref>{{cite web | author=Vaidya J |title = TARGIT (TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy) | url = http://www.targit.org.uk | accessdate = 2007-03-11}}</ref> is a method of delivering therapeutic radiation from within the breast using a portable X-ray generator called Intrabeam.

The ''TARGIT-A trial'' was an international randomised controlled non-inferiority phase III clinical trial led from [[University College London]]. 28 centres in 9 countries accrued 2,232 patients to test whether TARGIT can replace the whole course of radiotherapy in selected patients.<ref name=Vaidya_2000>{{cite web | title = Protocol 99PRT/47 Targeted Intraoperative radiotherapy (Targit) for breast cancer | author=Vaidya J, Tobias J, Baum M, Houghton J | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/misc/protocol/99PRT-47 | accessdate = 2007-03-11}}</ref> The TARGIT-A trial results found that the difference between the two treatments was 0.25% (95% CI -1.0 to 1.5) i.e., at most 1.5% worse or at best 1.0% better with single dose TARGIT than with standard course of several weeks of external beam radiotherapy.<ref>[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)60837-9/abstract Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy versus whole breast radiotherapy for breast cancer (TARGIT-A trial) an international, prospective, randomised, non-inferiority phase 3 trial | The Lancet]</ref> In the ''TARGIT-B trial'', as the TARGIT technique is precisely aimed and given immediately after surgery, in theory it could be able provide a better boost dose to the tumor bed as suggested in phase II studies.<ref name=Vaidya_2006>{{cite journal |author=Vaidya J, Baum M, Tobias J, Massarut S, Wenz F, Murphy O, Hilaris B, Houghton J, Saunders C, Corica T, Roncadin M, Kraus-Tiefenbacher U, Melchaert F, Keshtgar M, Sainsbury R, Douek M, Harrison E, Thompson A, Joseph D |title=Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) yields very low recurrence rates when given as a boost |journal=Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=1335&ndash;8 |year=2006 |pmid=17084562 |doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.07.1378}}</ref> This will be tested in a TARGIT-B trial.<ref>[http://www.targit.org.uk Targit trial | Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer | Jayant Vaidya Breast Surgeon and Oncologist Breast Cancer Specialist]</ref>

===Side effects of radiation therapy===
External beam radiation therapy is a non-invasive treatment with some short term and some longer-term side effects. Patients undergoing some weeks of treatment usually experience fatigue caused by the healthy tissue repairing itself and aside from this there can be no side effects at all. However many breast cancer patients develop a suntan-like change in skin color in the exact area being treated. As with a suntan, this darkening of the skin usually returns to normal in the one to two months after treatment. In some cases permanent changes in color and texture of the skin is experienced. Other side effects sometimes experienced with radiation can include:
*muscle stiffness
*mild swelling
*tenderness in the area
*lymphedema

After surgery, radiation and other treatments have been completed, many patients notice the affected breast seems smaller or seems to have shrunk. This is basically due to the removal of tissue during the lumpectomy operation.

The use of adjuvant radiation has significant potential effects if the patient has to later undergo [[breast reconstruction]] surgery. Fibrosis of chest wall skin from radiation negatively affects skin elasticity and makes [[tissue expansion]] techniques difficult. Traditionally most patients are advised to defer immediate breast reconstruction when adjuvant radiation is planned and are most often recommended surgery involving autologous tissue reconstruction rather than [[breast implant]]s.

Studies suggest APBI may reduce the side effects associated with radiation therapy, because it treats only the tumor cavity and the surrounding tissue. In particular, a device that uses multiple catheters and allows modulation of the radiation dose delivered by each of these catheters has been shown to reduce harm to nearby, healthy tissue.<ref>Yashar CM, Blair S, Wallace A, Scanderbeg D (2009). “Initial clinical experience with the Strut-Adjusted Volume Implant brachytherapy applicator for accelerated partial breast irradiation”. ''Brachytherapy'' '''8''': 367-72.</ref>

==Systemic therapy==
[[File:Nolvadex.jpg|thumb|Nolvadex ([[tamoxifen]]) 20 mg tablets ([[United Kingdom|UK]])]]
[[File:Arimidex.jpg|thumb|Arimidex ([[anastrozole]]) 1 mg tablets ([[Australia|AU]])]]

Systemic therapy uses medications to treat cancer cells throughout the body. Any combination of systemic treatments may be used to treat breast cancer. Systemic treatments include chemotherapy, immune therapy, and hormonal therapy.

=== Chemotherapy ===
{{See also|Breast cancer chemotherapy}}

[[Chemotherapy]] (drug treatment for cancer) may be used before surgery, after surgery, or instead of surgery for those cases in which surgery is considered unsuitable.

=== Hormonal Receptor Status ===
Women who have had breast cancer are at increased risk of a second primary breast cancer, compared with risk in the general population.

Patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors will typically receive [[hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]] after chemotherapy is completed. Typical hormonal treatments include:

*[[Tamoxifen]] is typically given to premenopausal women to inhibit the estrogen receptors.
*[[Aromatase inhibitor]]s are typically given to postmenopausal women to lower the amount of estrogen in their systems.
*[[GnRH]]-analogues are used in premenopausal women for ovarian suppression.

*Estrogen cycling was reported at the 31st annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. About a third of the 66 participants - women with metastatic breast cancer that had developed resistance to standard estrogen-lowering therapy - a daily dose of estrogen could stop the growth of their tumors or even cause them to shrink. If study participants experienced disease progression on estrogen, they could go back to an [[aromatase inhibitor]] that they were previously resistant to and see a benefit - their tumors were once again inhibited by estrogen deprivation. That effect sometimes wore off after several months, but then the tumors might again be sensitive to estrogen therapy. In fact, some patients have cycled back and forth between estrogen and an aromatase inhibitor for several years. PET ([[positron emission tomography]]) scans before starting estrogen and again 24 hours later predicted those tumors which responded to estrogen therapy: the responsive tumors showed an increased glucose uptake, called a PET flare. The mechanism of action is uncertain, although estrogen reduces the amount of a tumor-promoting hormone called [[insulin-like growth factor-1]] (IGF1).<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/132854.php Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer Can Benefit From Estrogen Pills. 12 Dec 2008]</ref>

=== Targeted therapy ===
In patients whose cancer expresses an over-abundance of the [[HER2]] protein, a [[monoclonal antibody]] known as [[trastuzumab]] (Herceptin) is used to block the activity of the HER2 protein in breast cancer cells, slowing their growth.
In the advanced cancer setting, trastuzumab use in combination with chemotherapy can both delay cancer growth as well as improve the recipient's survival.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Slamon DJ, Leyland-Jones B, Shak S ''et al.'' |title=Use of chemotherapy plus a monoclonal antibody against HER2 for metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2 |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=344|issue=11|pages=783&ndash;92 |year=2001 |pmid=11248153|doi=10.1056/NEJM200103153441101}}</ref> More recently, several clinical trials have also confirmed that in the adjuvant setting, i.e. postoperative following breast cancer surgery, the use of trastuzumab for up to one year also delays the recurrence of breast cancer and improves survival.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Piccart-Gebhart MJ, Procter M, Leyland-Jones B ''et al.'' |title=Trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=353|issue=16 |pages=1659&ndash;72 |year=2005 |pmid=16236737 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052306}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Joensuu H, Kellokumpu-Lehtinen PL, Bono P ''et al.'' |title=Adjuvant docetaxel or vinorelbine with or without trastuzumab for breast cancer |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=354 |issue=8|pages=809&ndash;20 |year=2006 |pmid=16495393 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa053028}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Romond EH, Perez EA, Bryant J ''et al.'' |title=Trastuzumab plus adjuvant chemotherapy for operable HER2-positive breast cancer |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=353|issue=16|pages=1673&ndash;1684 |year=2005 |pmid=16236738 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052122}}</ref>

Other types of targeted therapies that are being researched to fight cancer include:

* [[Angiogenesis]] inhibitors. These antibodies prevent the growth of new blood vessels, cutting off the supply of oxygen and nutrients to cancer cells.
* [[Signal transduction]] inhibitors. These antibodies block signals inside the cancer cell that helps the cells divide, stopping the cancer from growing.
* Antibodies/antagonists for other hormones/receptors such as [[androgen receptor]]s and [[prolactin receptor]]s, which are present in a high proportion of breast cancers.

'''CR011-vcMMAE''' aka CDX-011 and [[Glembatumumab vedotin]].
[[CR011-vcMMAE]] is an [[antibody-drug conjugate]] (ADC) (targeted at transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB)) that consists of a fully human monoclonal antibody, [[CR011]], linked to a potent cell-killing drug, [[monomethyl-auristatin E]] (MMAE). CR011-vcMMAE is currently in two Phase II trials assessing its safety and efficacy in the treatment of melanoma and for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and in a Phase I trial to evaluate the safety and activity of alternate dosing schedules.[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154376.php] [http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/15_suppl/8525] [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/173950.php]

==== Antiangiogenic therapy ====
A commercially available monoclonal antibody that blocks the activation of the [[VEGF receptor]], [[bevacizumab]], underwent testing in a [[randomized clinical trial]] whose preliminary results were announced by the National Cancer Institute in 2005.<ref>{{cite press release | title=Bevacizumab Combined With Chemotherapy Improves Progression-Free Survival for Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer | publisher=National Cancer Institute | date=2005-04-14 | url=http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pressreleases/AvastinBreast | accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> The preliminary data indicated that bevacizumab delays disease progression for up to five months over conventional chemotherapy, but survival was no better. [[Genentech]], manufacturer of bevacizumab, has filed a supplemental biological application with the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]] for approval of bevacizumab in the setting of [[metastatic]] breast cancer, on the strength of the improvement in [[progression-free survival]].

===Preclinical===

====Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B)====
In the March 2007, edition of the scientific journal, ''Nature Genetics'', researchers from Canada's [[McGill University]] reported that they had developed a potential drug target for treating up to 40 percent of breast cancers by blocking an [[enzyme]] called [[protein tyrosine phosphatase]] 1B ([[PTP1B]]), which has been implicated in the onset of breast cancer in mouse models of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Julien SG, Dubé N, Read M, ''et al.'' |title=Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B deficiency or inhibition delays ErbB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis and protects from lung metastasis |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=338&ndash;46 |year=2007 |pmid=17259984 |doi=10.1038/ng1963}}</ref> Elevated levels of PTP1B have also been found in [[diabetes]] and [[obesity]]. A drug to block the activity of PTP1B is under development by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]], and was found to delay the development of breast tumors and prevent [[lung cancer]] up to two months from the administration of the drug. The researchers hope to continue further research in mouse models which are also HER-2 positive (responsive to [[Herceptin]]) so that the drug could benefit a significant population of women.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6646193.stm Breast tumour drug target found], BBC News, 20 May 2007</ref>

====Cholesterol drug - Ro 48-8071 ====
It is possible that one mechanism utilized by PRIMA-1 to kill cancer cells may include shutting down [[cholesterol]] synthesis. What is now known is that Ro 48-8071 stops cholesterol synthesis, and it has been proved to be just as effective in destroying cancer cells as PRIMA-1, without harming other normal breast cells.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/217274.php]</ref>

====Antidiabetic====
In experiments led by postdoctoral fellows Heather Hirsch and Dimitrios Iliopoulos, the combination of [[metformin]] and the cancer drug [[doxorubicin]] killed human cancer stem cells and non-stem cancer cells in culture. The researchers used four genetically distinct breast cancer cell lines.

In mice, pretreatment with the diabetes drug prevented the otherwise dramatic ability of human breast cancer stem cells to form tumors. In other mice where tumors were allowed to take hold for 10 days, the dual therapy also reduced tumor mass more quickly and prevented relapse for longer than doxorubicin alone. In the two months between the end of treatment and the end of the experiment, tumors regrew in mice treated with chemotherapy alone, but not in mice that had received both drugs. By itself, metformin was ineffective in treating tumors. [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/163990.php], [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/222376.php]

====Thermochemotherapy====
Modern advancements in [[hyperthermia]] biology have led to refinements for individualised [[thermochemotherapy]] approaches to treatments as well as interesting potential for exploiting hyperthermia in conjunction with [[cancer vaccine]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} MR imaging is playing an increasing role for measuring patient response to hyperthermia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Interest in [[Hyperthermia therapy|hyperthermia as a treatment]] for breast cancer has led to significant advances and research activity which, in turn, has had a significant impact on treatment protocol.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) now includes hyperthermia in their Breast Cancer Guidelines as a treatment for recurrent cancer.

Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands is one of Europe's largest hyperthermia centres.

ThermoDox is a proprietary heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of [[doxorubicin]], an approved and frequently used oncology drug for the treatment of a wide range of cancers including breast cancer. ThermoDox, which is administered intravenously and in combination with local hyperthermia, has the potential to provide local tumor control and improve quality of life. Localized mild hyperthermia (39.5-42 degrees Celsius) releases the entrapped doxorubicin from the liposome. This delivery technology enables high concentrations of doxorubicin to be deposited preferentially in a targeted tumor.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

====Flax====
Testing of [[flaxseed]] (the highest source of mammalian [[lignan]]s) on rats led to reduction and regression of tumours. This led to a formal [[randomized]], [[placebo-controlled]], [[double-blind]] study involving 32 [[postmenopausal]] patients confirming that 25g flaxseed daily intake significantly reduced cell proliferation, increased [[apoptosis]] and reduced c-erbB2 expression of human breast cancer cells.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Thompson | first = L.

===Immunotherapy===
The [[immune system]] can help a body fight tumors.<ref>[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2009/1/healing-heat/1]</ref>

====Dendritic cell therapy====
A new clinical trial is designed around the use of QI's proprietary dendritic cell therapy, which employs [[oncofetal antigen]] ("OFA") to recruit the patient's own immune system to target and attack the cancer cells with the intent to improve patient survivability and quality of life. Each patient will receive three monthly injections of the patient's own dendritic cells that have been sensitized to OFA. It is anticipated that once the sensitized cells are injected back into the patient, the patient's T-cells will locate the OFA found on the patient's cancer cells, thereby generating an immune response with the goal of killing the cancer cells and preventing further spread of the disease.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/157912.php]</ref>

====Stimuvax - mostly for hormone receptor positive (phase III)====
[[Stimuvax]] is an investigational therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to induce an immune response to cancer cells that express MUC1, a glycoprotein antigen widely expressed on common cancers. MUC1 is over-expressed on many cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. Stimuvax is thought to work by stimulating the body's immune system to identify and destroy cancer cells expressing MUC1. [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154900.php]

Phase IIb study of 171 patients with inoperable stage IIIb [[NSCLC]] (lung cancer), in which Stimuvax showed a trend towards extending median overall survival from 13.3 months for patients receiving best supportive care (BSC) to 30.6 months for patients receiving Stimuvax plus BSC.2,3 Reported side effects included mild-to-moderate flu-like symptoms, gastrointestinal disturbances and mild injection-site reactions.

===Chemoimmunotherapy===
Manipulating the immune system to recognize and eradicate breast tumor cells is a highly attractive alternative approach to disease management. Active immunization offers multiple theoretical advantages over all other therapies, including low toxicity. The sustained antitumor effect due to immunological memory would obviate the requirement for prolonged, repetitive cycles of therapy.

The objective of chemoimmunotherapy is to amplify natural pre-existing T cell responses specific for any known or unknown tumor antigen and to recruit and amplify new tumor-specific T cell responses resulting from the use of cytotoxic drugs. The direct cytolytic effect of some cytotoxic drugs, such as paclitaxel, can enhance antigen presentation by inducing tumor cell apoptosis. This mechanism of therapeutic synergy has been shown with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, or paclitaxel when given with dendritic cell - based vaccines. Until 9 years ago, it was thought that the T cell depletion caused by chemotherapy would make immunotherapy ineffective. However it has now been shown that, on the contrary, the vigorous T cell repopulation following depletion can be directed against the tumor.

IMP321 induced both a sustained increase in the number and activation of APC (monocytes and dendritic cells) and an increase in the percentage of NK and long-lived cytotoxic effector-memory CD8 T cells. Clinical benefit was observed for 90 per cent of patients with only 3 progressors at 6 months. Also, the objective tumor response rate of 50 per cent compared favorably to the 25 per cent rate reported in the historical control group. This form of chemo-immunotherapy should be applicable to many chemotherapies. [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/200182.php]

===Thermochemotherapy===
Medifocus heat treatment added to Standard of Care (SoC) chemotherapy increased the median tumor shrinkage in the thermochemotherapy arm to 88.4%, while for chemotherapy alone the median tumor shrinkage was 58.8%. For the thermo-chemotherapy treatment arm, almost 80% of breast tumors had a tumor volume reduction of 80% or more, compared to only 20% for the chemotherapy alone.[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/205491.php]

===Alternative treatments===
A wide range of [[alternative medicine|alternative non-medical treatments]] of breast cancer have been proposed,<ref>[http://liwa.piczo.com]</ref>

Doctors have begun treating women suffering from breast cancer with a procedure known as [[cryoablation]]. The treatment freezes, than defrosts tumors using small needles so that only the harmful tissue is damaged and ultimately dies.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9732036/Breast-cancer-could-be-treated-by-turning-tumours-into-ball-of-ice.html Breast cancer could be treated by turning tumors into ball of ice. Telegraph UK. Dec 9 2012]</ref> The advantage of this technique includes alternative to surgery, limiting hospital visits and reducing scarring. The device and treatment was developed by IceCure Medical, an [[Israel]]i-based company. The device is approved for use in the United States, and is pending approval in Europe.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/>

==Gene expression profiling==
{{Main| Breast cancer classification#DNA microarrays}}
[[Breast cancer classification#DNA microarrays|Gene expression profiling]] of breast tumors can predict the chances of developing breast cancer again. The most useful setting for these tests is where the benefit of chemotherapy is felt to be small. In up to 10% of patients, there will be disease recurrences, but treating every patient with chemotherapy is overkill. In this setting, a high-risk score can help doctors decide whether to recommend chemotherapy.

==Treatment response assessment==
<blockquote>
Physical examination and conventional imaging techniques still have an important place in the evaluation of breast cancer treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At this time, this morphologic evaluation is the only one recognized by the international criteria. The new functional and metabolic imaging modalities, particularly MRI and PET scan, can approach the nature of residual tumour, allow early detection of bad responders and depict multifocal tumours and metastases.

===Blood test===
The current standard of care for metastatic disease involves the use of radiology studies such as CT scans, ultrasounds, and the like to determine whether or not patients are deriving benefit from their current therapies. An alternative is the FDA-approved CellSearch technology, looking at circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood collected from women in need of a new treatment regimen for metastatic breast cancer. About one tablespoon of blood was collected when the patient started the new therapy, and then again at three to four week intervals. The number of CTCs was correlated with disease response or progression as determined by standard radiology studies (e.g., CT scans) performed every nine to 12 weeks.[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/164155.php]

==Managing side effects==
Drugs and radiotherapy given for cancer can cause unpleasant side effects such as nausea and vomiting, mouth sores, dermatitis, and menopausal symptoms. Around a third of patients with cancer use complementary therapies, including homeopathic medicines, to try to reduce these side effects. [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146077.php]

===Insomnia===
It was believed that one would find a bi-directional relationship between insomnia and pain, but instead it was found that trouble sleeping was more likely a cause, rather than a consequence, of pain in patients with cancer. An early intervention to manage sleep would overall relieve patient with side effects.[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146317.php]

Approximately 40 percent of menopausal women experience sleep disruption, often in the form of difficulty with sleep initiation and frequent nighttime awakenings. There is a study, first to show sustained benefits in sleep quality from gabapentin, which Rochester researchers already have demonstrated alleviates hot flashes. [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/163260.php]

===Hot flashes===
Gabapentin and many of antidepressants are commonly prescribed for treatment of hot flashes, although these agents are not specifically approved by the FDA for such use.

Pregabalin is a newer version of gabapentin and is found equally effective in treating hot flashes.[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/150286.php]

== Reoccurrence monitoring==
Chronix Biomedical has reported new data further demonstrating that its serum DNA blood tests have the potential to accurately detect early stage breast cancer and prostate cancer. Chronix's proprietary technology identifies disease-specific genetic fingerprints based on circulating DNA fragments that are released into the bloodstream by damaged and dying (apoptotic) cells.

The tests use proprietary algorithms developed by Chronix researchers to detect, analyze and identify cancer-related fragments of circulating DNA that are released into the bloodstream by apoptotic cells. Chronix researchers consistently find that this apoptotic DNA in the serum is coming from a limited number of regions or "hotspots" on the genome specific to each cancer. According to the data presented today, DNA fragments from any one of the 29 breast cancer "hotspots" and 32 prostate cancer "hotspots" identified by Chronix researchers indicate that cancer is present.
