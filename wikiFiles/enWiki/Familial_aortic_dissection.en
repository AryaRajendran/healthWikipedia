'''Familial aortic dissection''' or FAD refers to the splitting of the wall of the aorta in either the arch, ascending or descending portions. FAD is thought to be passed down as an [[autosomal dominant]] [[disease]] and once inherited will result in [[dissection]] of the [[aorta]], and [[aneurysm|dissecting aneurysm]] of the aorta, or rarely [[aortic]] or [[aneurysm|arterial dilation]] at a young age. Dissection refers to the actual tearing open of the aorta. However, the exact gene(s) involved has not yet been identified.<ref name="pmid2647812">{{cite journal |author=Nicod P, Bloor C, Godfrey M, ''et al.'' |title=Familial aortic dissecting aneurysm |journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=811–9 |year=1989 |pmid=2647812 |doi=10.1016/0735-1097(89)90221-0}}</ref> It can occur in the absence of clinical features of [[Marfan syndrome]] and of [[hypertension|systemic hypertension]].<ref name="pmid1769452">{{cite journal |author=Disertori M, Bertagnolli C, Thiene G, ''et al.'' |title=[Familial dissecting aortic aneurysm] |language=Italian |journal=Giornale Italiano di Cardiologia |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=849–53 |year=1991 |month=August |pmid=1769452}}</ref><ref name="pmid9138854">{{cite journal |author=Cucchi G. |title=[Familial aortic dissection in a young woman.

This condition, unless found and treated early, usually results in death. Immediate surgery is the best prognosis in most cases.<ref name=Pretre /> FAD is not to be confused with PAU ([[penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer]]s) and IMH (intramural hematoma), both of which present in ways similar to that of familial aortic dissection.<ref name=Gallo>{{cite journal |author=Gallo A, Davies R, Coe M, Elefteriades J, Coady M. |title=Indications, timing, and prognosis of operative repair of aortic dissections |journal=Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery |year=2005 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=224–35 |doi=10.1053/j.semtcvs.2005.06.004}}</ref>

==Physiology==

FAD is normally associated with [[Marfan syndrome]], [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome|Ehlers-Danlo syndrome]], and various other genetic disorders which affect the connective tissues of the cardiovascular system. There are various mechanisms by which the medial layers of the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] are stressed and eventually torn.<ref name=Nienaber>{{cite journal |author=Nienaber C, Eagle K. |title=Aortic dissection: new frontiers in diagnosis and management. Part I: from etiology to diagnostic strategies |journal=Circulation |year=2003 |volume=108 |issue=5 |pages=628–35 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000087009.16755.E4}}</ref> Once torn these areas begin to fill with blood and become susceptible to aneurysm formation. Depending on the location of the tare, FAD normally affects the ascending or descending aorta, where the primary characteristic of a bulge can be seen. This bulge is the result of the creation of a false lumen due to the vast amount of blood seepage from the aortas and surrounding veins.<ref name=Lansman>{{cite journal |author=Lansman S, McCullough J, Nguyen K, Spielvogel D, Klein J, Galla J, Ergin M, Griepp R. |title=Subtypes of acute aortic dissection |journal=The Annals of Thoracic Surgery |year=1999 |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=1975–8 |doi=10.1016/S0003-4975(99)00419-1}}</ref> In some cases it is not uncommon to see degeneration in the ascending and descending aorta and the [[Heart valve|atrioventricular and semilunar valves]] due to elastolysis or breakdown and loss of elastic fibers. These connective tissue malfunctions are traceable to mutations, and lack of genes encoding for important components such as collagens, and micro- fibril associated glycoproteins. Breakdown among these connective layers eventually compromises the integrity of the aortic lumen.<ref name=Nienaber/>

Depending on the extent of pooling and damage to the blood vessel, the Svensson system was created to diagnose and describe the five classes of pathological processes that may be visible due to the dissection. Class 1 refers to any dissection with a true and false lumen. Class 2 specifically depends on the presence of [[hematoma]] or [[hemorrhaging]] at the site of the dissection. Class 3 is a dissection without hematoma. Class 4 is recognized by the presence of an ulcer among the lumen. Class 5 has to do with any sort of traumatic hemorrhaging in the dissection.<ref name=Golledge>{{cite journal |author=Golledge J, Eagle K. |title=Acute aortic dissection |journal=The Lancet |year=2008 |volume=372 |issue=9632 |pages=55–66 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60994-0}}</ref> Class 5, in the most case, is the most severe and life threatening due to large amounts of rapid blood loss.

Those experiencing aortic dissection typically will complain of agonizing pains described with a ripping feeling in the chest that for some may migrate to their backs.<ref name=Gallo /> Anything that compromises or obstructs the amount of blood flow and the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the walls of the ascending and descending aorta has a large impact on the viability of the layers of the surrounding lumen. Chronic hypertension, Inflammatory disease, excessive plaque build up among coronary walls, intimal thickening, and [[Arteriosclerosis]] are all believed to increase the likely hood of FAD occurring in an individual.

==Causes==

Inheritance is thought to be rather complex. There is a good amount of evidence that shows the disease is [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal dominant]], with some [[penetrance]]. There is also the possibility of age related dependence. It is known that Marfan’s Syndrome and [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome|Ehler-Danlos Syndrome]] lead to an increased risk for development of FAD. Marfan’s Syndrome is not required to have an aortic dissection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Milewicz D, Chen H, Park E, Petty E, Zaghi H, Pai G, Willing M, Patel V. |title=Reduced penetrance and variable expressivity of familial thoracic aortic aneurysms/dissections |journal=The American Journal of Cardiology |year=1998 |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=474–9 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(98)00364-6}}</ref> One study suggests that the chromosomal locus for the gene is 5q13-14.

There are several hypotheses which attempt to explain how the dissection physically occurs. The first states that a tear develops in the intima layer of the aorta which allows blood to flow from the lumen of the aorta into the intima. This event creates a dissection and essentially two lumens. The second hypothesis suggests that the [[vasa vasorum]] ruptures and causes a hemorrhage in the wall of the aorta. The hemorrhaging promotes tearing of the intima and eventually aortic dissection.<ref name=Braverman>{{cite journal |author=Braverman A. |title=Aortic dissection: prompt diagnosis and emergency treatment are critical |journal=Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine |year=2011 |volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=685–96 |doi=10.3949/ccjm.78a.11053}}</ref>

The major risk factors for FAD include high blood pressure, old age, haematoma, genetic weakening of aortic wall, cocaine use, pregnancy and diseases causing abnormal connective tissue.<ref name=Pretre>{{cite journal |author=Prêtre R, Segesser V, Ludwig K. |title=Aortic dissection |journal=The Lancet |year=1997 |volume=9063 |issue=349 |pages=1461–4 |pmid=9164331 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)09372-5}}</ref><ref name=Braverman /> One study found that the average age(s) for the occurrence of dissection caused by degenerative aneurysm is 65 years and up. Dissections thought to be the result of genetic mutations appear to be more likely to occur between the ages of 40 and 60. Another study found that 20% of patients with FAD have a close relative with a history of thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection which suggests yet another major risk factor.<ref name=Gleason>{{cite journal |author=Gleason T. |title=Heritable disorders predisposing to aortic dissection |journal=Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery |year=2005 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=274–81 |pmid=16253833 |doi=10.1053/j.semtcvs.2005.06.001}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

Since the cause of FAD has not been genetically pinpointed, the only way to diagnose FAD is through the examination of phenotypic variations in the aorta. Usually [[echocardiography]] is used to take measurements of the aortic root<ref name=Sakari>{{cite journal |author=Kakko S, Räisänen T, Tamminen M, Airaksinen J, Groundstroem K, Juvonen T, Ylitalo A, Uusimaa P, Savolainen M. |title=Candidate locus analysis of familial ascending aortic aneurysms and dissections confirms the linkage to the chromosome 5q13-14 in Finnish families |journal=The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery |year=2003 |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=106–13 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5223(03)00037-0 |pmid=12878945}}</ref> as well as [[Echocardiography|transesophageal echocardiography]].<ref name=Gallo /> [[Biomarker]]s lend a quick way to diagnose dissection when time is of the essence. These have the ability to relay the levels of [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]] mysosin heavy chain protein present, which is released from damaged aortic tissue.<ref name=Mukherjee>{{cite journal |author=Mukherjee D, Eagle K. Aortic dissection–an update |journal=Current Problems in Cardiology |year=2005 |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=287–325 |doi=10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2005.01.002 |pmid=15973249}}</ref>

There are two types of FAD; groups A and B. Normally if any area of the ascending aorta is involved in the dissection this is considered group A. If the dissection occurs within the descending aorta this is classified in group B.<ref name=Golledge />  These two groups can than be broken down into three classes of FAD: Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3. Group A consists of Types 1 and 2, whereas Group B consists only of Type 3. Type 1 encompasses dissection in the distal ascending aorta closest to the heart, not including the aortic arch. Type 2 refers to dissection of the ascending aorta, closer to and including the aortic arch. Type 3 refers to the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta.<ref name=Pretre />

Group A dissections are the more serious of the two due to the location of the dissection in the ascending aorta, which leads to a higher risk of [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] and [[pericardium]] and/or aortic valve rupture. Individuals also tend to be predisposed to type A if they do have Marfans or Elhers-Danlos syndromes. These contribute to a higher fatality rate in group A dissection if immediate surgery is not performed. The most common corrective surgeries are actual aortic valve replacement and [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary artery bypass]]. The five year survival rate after surgery is a successful 70.4% due to vigilant monthly physical exams and chest x-rays to monitor progress. Group B dissections typically have a higher surgery mortality rate and are therefore not good candidates. Instead medical management is the common response to treating and keeping dissections of the descending aorta under control.<ref name=Gallo />

==Treatment==

Type 1 and Type 2 FAD call for the same treatment: immediate surgery to replace the aorta. Surgery is required due to the high risk of mortality. Type 3 is less severe and requires the maintenance of blood pressure through diet and exercise. Upon diagnosing someone with FAD [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous antihypertensive treatment]] is frequently used. Often intravenous [[sodium nitroprusside]] is used for its efficiency in lessening the pulsatile load thus reducing blood pressure. Reducing this force slows the progression of the dissection. Surgical success depends on age, severity of symptoms, postoperative organ dysfunction and stroke. Surgical intervention is always indicated in Type 1 cases. Aortic surgery is palliative, not curative. The goal is to merely to prevent rupture, restore blood flow, and fix any aortic valve dysfunction.<ref name=Chen1997>{{cite journal |author=Chen K, Varon J, Wenker O, Judge D, Fromm R, Sternbach G. |title=Acute thoracic aortic dissection: the basics |journal=The Journal of Emergency Medicine |year=1997 |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=859–67 |doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(97)00196-0 |pmid=9404805}}</ref> Post operative protocols include frequent monitoring of the aorta diameter. Statins and [[beta blocker]]s are also popular treatments used to reduce future plaque build up and blockage of [[epinephrine]] receptors as a way to control heart rate and blood pressure.<ref name=Mukherjee />

Long term treatment should also include regular check ups every 3 to 6 months. A [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] is recommended, along with required chest x-rays. [[Antihypertensive drug|Antihypertensive therapy]] with [[Beta blocker|beta adrenergic antagonists]] is required regardless of medical versus surgical treatment. Ten to twenty percent of those who choose surgical intervention are re-operated on due to compression, aneurysm development or blood leakage.<ref name=Chen1997/>

== Research directions ==
Currently, there is controversy over whether or not inheritance truly plays a role in FAD, and if so which gene it acts upon. FAD does not come from strictly one predisposing factor, such as hypertension. It is suggested that the combination of environmental factors along with genetics may contribute to causing FAD. Before newer and more effective cures and therapies can be developed, first the specific gene mutation must be identified. Until such a gene is determined, scientists say patient education, and physician awareness is vital.<ref name=Sakari>{{cite journal | author = Kakko S, Räisänen T, Tamminen M, Airaksinen J, Groundstroem K, Juvonen T, Ylitalo A, Uusimaa P, Savolainen M.
