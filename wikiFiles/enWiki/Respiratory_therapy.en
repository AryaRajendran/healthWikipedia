A '''respiratory therapist''' is a specialized [[healthcare profession|healthcare practitioner]] who has graduated from a college or a university and passed a national board certifying examination.  Respiratory therapists work under the general supervision of an intensive care [[physician]] or [[pulmonologist]].

Respiratory therapists are specialists in [[airway management]]; establishing and maintaining the airway during management of trauma, intensive care, and may administer [[anaesthesia]] for surgery or conscious sedation.  Respiratory therapists often are in charge of initiating and managing [[life support]] for people in intensive care units and emergency departments, stabilizing and monitoring high risk patients being moved from hospital to hospital by air or ground ambulance, and administering medications and medical gases such as asthma medication, oxygen, and anaesthetic gases.

== Clinical practice ==
[[File:Respiratory therapist.jpg|thumb|Respiratory Therapist in an intensive care unit]]
Respiratory therapists educate, diagnose, and treat people who are suffering from heart and lung problems.  Specialised in both cardiac and pulmonary care, respiratory therapists often collaborate with specialists in pulmonology and anaesthesia in various aspects of clinical care of patients. Respiratory therapists provide a vital role in both [[medicine]] and [[nursing]].

Respiratory therapists are also primary clinicians in conducting tests to measure lung function and teaching people to manage [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder]] among many other cardiac and lung functions.  Internationally, respiratory therapists that provide lung function testing are termed respiratory scientists, but in North America, they may be a respiratory therapist or may also be a certified pulmonary function technician in the United States.

Outside of clinics and hospitals, respiratory therapists often manage home oxygen needs of patients and their families, providing around the clock support for home ventilators and other equipment for conditions like [[sleep apnea]].

Respiratory therapists work in many settings within medicine. In the hospital setting, respiratory therapists evaluate, diagnose and cardiopulmonary illness.  In the clinic or outpatient setting respiratory therapists assist with diagnosis and serve as an educator for patients suffering from cardiac and respiratory illness.<ref>{{cite news |title=PCC Notes: Respiratory students train |author= |url=http://www.reflector.com/news/pcc-notes-respiratory-students-train-759223 |newspaper=The Reflector |date= |accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref>   In the [[United States]], respiratory therapists with certification as [[Registered Respiratory Therapist]]s evaluate and treat patients with a great deal of autonomy under the direction of a [[pulmonologist]].<ref name="pmid19558737">{{cite journal| author=Harbrecht BG, Delgado E, Tuttle RP, Cohen-Melamed MH, Saul MI, Valenta CA| title=Improved outcomes with routine respiratory therapist evaluation of non-intensive-care-unit surgery patients.  | journal=[[Respiratory Care (journal)|Respiratory Care]] | year= 2009 | volume= 54 | issue= 7 | pages= 861–7 | pmid=19558737 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref>  In facilities that maintain critical care transport teams respiratory therapists are a preferred addition to all types of [[Ambulance|surface]] or [[Air medical services|air transport]].<ref name="pmid10130326">{{cite journal| author=O'Malley RJ, Rhee KJ| title=Contribution of air medical personnel to the airway management of injured patients.  | journal=Air Med J | year= 1993 | volume= 12 | issue= 11-12 | pages= 425–8 | pmid=10130326 | doi=10.1016/S1067-991X(05)80138-5 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=10130326  }}</ref>  In other settings respiratory therapists are found in schools as asthma educators, working with teachers and coaches about childhood symptoms of asthma and how to spot an emergency.

{{see also|Pulmonary rehabilitation|Pulmonary hygiene}}

=== Medication ===
[[Medication]] is the most important treatment of most diseases of [[pulmonology]] and [[cardiology]], usually by inhalation ([[bronchodilator]]s and [[steroid]]s) or also by mouth or IV ([[antibiotic]]s, [[leukotriene antagonist]]s).  A common example being the usage of [[inhalers]] in the treatment of inflammatory lung conditions such as [[Asthma]] or [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] ([[Emphysema]]).  [[Oxygen therapy]] is often necessary in severe respiratory disease such as [[pulmonary fibrosis]].

=== Intensive care ===
[[Mechanical ventilation]] may be required in instances of rapidly advancing disease or difficulty after surgery.  Different [[modes of mechanical ventilation]] are used for various instances depending on the patients need.   Respiratory Therapists are frequently required to [[intubate]], initiate [[intravenous]] lines, place [[arterial line]]s as well as many other vascular accesses such as [[central venous catheter]]s and [[pulmonary artery catheter]]s (Swan-Ganz).<ref name="pmid10813223"/>  Respiratory Therapists are specialists in life support initiation and management.  All United States [[neonatal intensive care unit]]s with a level 2 or greater designation are required to have dedicated respiratory therapists to that intensive care unit in order to maintain accreditation from the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]].

=== Pulmonary rehabilitation ===
[[Pulmonary rehabilitation]] may be initiated as a treatment as a source for continuity of improvement after a hospital stay or as a therapeutic way to increase quality of life.   Pulmonary rehabilitation is intended to educate the patient, the family, and improve the overall quality of life and [[prognosis]] for the patient.   Pulmonary Rehabilitation involves therapies and evaluations by respiratory therapists, [[Occupational Therapist]]s and [[Physical Therapist]]s.

== Credentialing and licensure ==

=== United States and Canada ===
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], respiratory therapists are healthcare professionals who, after receiving a degree in respiratory medicine or respiratory science complete a credentialing process.   After satisfactorily completing the required examinations and added to a registry, the practitioner is then eligible to apply for a license to practice in the region governed by their respective licensing body.   In the [[United States]], specialist respiratory therapists are clinicians who hold National Board for Respiratory Care specialty credentials, which may include neonatal/pediatric specialist (CRT-NPS or RRT-NPS), adult critical care specialist (RRT-ACCS), sleep disorder specialist (CRT-SDS or RRT-SDS), and pulmonary function technologist (CPFT or RPFT). The NBRC's RRT-ACCS examination is the newest NBRC examination that was launched in 2012.  Professional credentials denoted as a certified Asthma Educator (AE-C) may also be earned by passing the National Asthma Educator Certification Board (NAECB).  In Canada, some similar credentialing exists, such as the Certified Respiratory Educator program.

== International respiratory care ==
Except for the United States and Canada, very few countries have a dedicated professional role for respiratory health. In these countries, respiratory care is provided by physiotherapists, nurses and physicians that have chosen to specialize in this field.  In many countries this recognition is in a transition stage; as an example, in 2011, hospitals in [[Beijing, China]] began a recruitment drive to acquire respiratory therapists for their intensive care units where previously nurses were the only clinician.<ref name="pmid22005194">{{cite journal| author=Li J, Zhan QY, Liang ZA, Tu ML, Sun B, Yao XL et al.| title=Respiratory Care Practices and Requirement for Respiratory Therapists in Beijing ICUs.  | journal=[[Respiratory Care (journal)|Respiratory Care]] | year= 2011 | volume=  57| issue=  3| pages=  370–6| pmid=22005194 | doi=10.4187/respcare.01093 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=22005194  }}</ref>

=== Canada ===
Upon graduation from an accredited school of respiratory therapy, the graduate is then eligible to write the national exam administered by the [[Canadian Board for Respiratory Care]].  Success on this examination will then allow the respiratory therapist to register with any licensing body in Canada.  Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan are the Canadian provinces with provincial licensing bodies; in these provinces, it is illegal to practice the profession of Respiratory Care without first being licensed as a full or practicing member with the provincial licensing body.  These provinces are so-called regulated provinces.  In all other jurisdictions, the licensing body for the profession of Respiratory Care is the [[Canadian Society for Respiratory Therapy]].  Registration as a full member is optional for respiratory therapists living in regulated provinces, however, for respiratory therapists living in non-regulated provinces, registration as a full member with the CSRT is compulsory.  Registration with the provincial regulatory body or the CSRT (in non-regulated provinces) confers upon the respiratory therapist the title of Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT).   

=== France ===
Respiratory therapy is a sub-specialty of [[physical therapy]] in France.<ref>World Confederation for Physical Therapy. Federation Francaise des Masseurs Kinesitherapeutes Reeducateurs</ref>   Respiratory care as a specialty is regulated by the Fédération Française des Masseurs Kinésithérapeutes Rééducateurs.

=== Germany ===
The German Respiratory Society<ref>Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pneumologie und Beatmungsmedizin e. V. (DGP)</ref> first issued a resolution to develop the dedicated respiratory therapist (RT) role in 2004 as a means to increase the quality of patient care, delegate physician duties and respond to the observed increase in respiratory conditions and diseases. In 2006-2006, a year-long pilot training program was offered to established nurses and physiotherapists.<ref>Karg O, Bubulj C, Esche B, Geiseler J, Bonnet R, Mäder I. [The respiratory therapist]. Pneumologie. 2008;62(11):685-9.</ref>  Researchers report that significant

=== United Arab Emirates ===
In [[United Arab Emirates]] respiratory therapists must have been awarded a [[Bachelor of Science in Respiratory Care]].   An additional two-years of experience is required for foreign applicants.   Licenses are maintained and awarded by the [[Dubai Health Authority]].   The [[Dubai Health Authority]] restricts respiratory therapists to working only in physical medicine and rehabilitation Centers, in hospitals, in surgical clinics with cardio-thoracic surgeons and with physicians in family/general practice or pulmonology.<ref>{{cite web  | last = [[Dubai Health Authority]]  | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Allied Healthcare Professionals' Licensure  | work =   | publisher = Dubai Health Authority (DHA)  | date =   | url = http://www.dha.gov.ae/EN/SectorsDirectorates/Directorates/HealthRegulation/HealthProfessionals/Physicians/Documents/Allied%20Healthcare%20Professionals.pdf  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 02/03/2012}}</ref>

=== United States ===
[[File:US Navy 031204-N-0000W-001 Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Raul Huerta, a Respiratory Therapy Technologist.jpg|thumb|A Respiratory Therapist teaches students about the dangers of smoking.]]
In the United States a respiratory therapist is a clinician who has at a minimum completed an [[Associate of Science in Respiratory Care]] degree along with a certification process.   After satisfactorily completing required examinations either administered by the [[National Board for Respiratory Care]] or directly by the individual state licensing board (either the medical examiners board or a special state  respiratory care board).   There are two recognized governing bodies in the United States; the State Board of Respiratory Care in the state in which a respiratory therapist is licensed to practice and the other is the [[National Board for Respiratory Care]] (NBRC) a non-profit organization which regulates two levels of certification along with some additional specialist certifications.   The [[Certified Respiratory Therapist]] (CRT) and the [[Registered Respiratory Therapist]] (RRT).   The CRT is the certification given after successfully passing the entry-level examination [[NBRC-ELE]]; The RRT certification is given after first becoming a CRT and then passing the [[NBRC-WRE]] and [[NBRC-CSE]].

Most state boards of respiratory care require proof of the appropriate NBRC credential and award various license titles; including (but not limited to) Respiratory Care Practitioner, Licensed Registered Respiratory Therapist, and Licensed Certified Respiratory Therapist.   There has been a substantial push to standardize the state licensure by the [[American Association for Respiratory Care]].<ref name="pmid19245732"/>  The NBRC credential is renewed every 5 years for a fee in addition to fees assessed by the state boards of respiratory care.

===United Kingdom===
Respiratory therapy in the UK is not a recognized specific profession, but a specialization route available to physicians, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists.

Common titles include Respiratory Nurse, Clinical Respiratory Physiologist, Cardio-Respiratory Physiotherapist and Cardio-Respiratory Occupational Therapist.

Physical therapists in training may either pursue a diploma or bachelor’s degree from an accredited post-secondary institution. At the diploma level, an individual receives a Diploma of Higher Education in Respiratory Care or Respiratory Disease Management.

At the degree level, a Bachelor of Science in Clinical Physiology is issued with a specialist option in respiratory physiology. Beyond the diploma and degree level, Master of Science programs in Respiratory Care, Respiratory Disease Management, Advanced Cardiology and Clinical Respiratory Physiology are available.

=== Anesthesia assistants ===
[[File:Vaporizer.jpg|thumb|Anesthesia vaporizer]]
The traditional role of the operating room respiratory therapist has included providing technical support to the [[anesthesiologist]] for the proper use and maintenance of the [[anesthetic]] gas machine, in addition to also providing [[airway management]].  This role in the operating room has evolved to include a more advanced and specialized role with increasing responsibilities to the respiratory therapist.  Like [[nurse anesthetist]]s, respiratory therapists are academically prepared to perform activities such as sedation by administration of anesthetic gases and medications, insertion and management of vascular (arterial and venous) access and assessment of the depth of [[anesthesia]] under the guidance of an [[anesthesiologist]] or [[nurse anesthetist]] and under the authority of medical directives.<ref>http://www.crto.on.ca/pdf/Positions/RT-Anesthesia-Assistant.pdf</ref>  This role is similar to the more main-steam [[nurse anesthetist]] profession,<ref name=Five>{{cite web|author=|title=Five facts about AAs|publisher=American Academy of Anesthesiologist Assistants|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060926091707/http://www.anesthetist.org/content/view/14/38/|archivedate=2006-09-26|url=http://www.anesthetist.org/content/view/14/38/|accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> and is defined as equivalent by the United States regulations for anesthesia service providers.<ref>United States Code of Federal Regulations (42 C.F.R. § 482.52 Condition of participation: Anesthesia services)</ref>

Note that, in the U.S., becoming an anethesia assistant is a two-year program of study at the master's level. Pre-requisites for entry into an AA program are similar to those for medical school including advanced chemistry, biology, physics and math.

=== Asthma specialists ===
[[Asthma]] specialists work with clinics, hospitals and schools as an educator for teachers, parents, patients and practitioners on asthma and allergies.   Respiratory Therapists in the role as an Asthma Educator additionally help diagnose and treat asthma and other respiratory illness.<ref>http://www.childrenshospital.vanderbilt.org/interior.php?mid=6587 Vanderbilt Children's Asthma Clinic</ref>  Additionally, an Asthma Educator is the resource clinician in inpatient and outpatient environments for evaluating and advising physicians on treatment plans and helping facilitate patient understanding and compliance with the plan.<ref name="pmid16478832">{{cite journal| author=Davis JJ, Bailey WC| title=Teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime.  | journal=Chest | year= 2006 | volume= 129 | issue= 2 | pages= 220–1 | pmid=16478832 | doi=10.1378/chest.129.2.220 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=16478832  }}</ref> In the United States, Certified Asthma Educators (AE-C) are credentialed by the [[National Asthma Education Certification Board]] (NAECB).<ref>http://www.naecb.org National Asthma Education Certification Board (NAECB)</ref> 

In Canada, the Canadian Network for Respiratory Care administers two certifications for the specialization as Respiratory Therapist Asthma Educator, the Certified Asthma Educator (CAE) (preferred by practitioners with a pediatric focus) and the Certified Respiratory Educator (CRE), which comprises the CAE program with additional training in [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]].<ref>http://www.cnrchome.net/whatitis.html Canadian Network for Respiratory Care Certification for Asthma and Respiratory Educators (CAEs and CREs)</ref>

=== Cystic fibrosis ===
Respiratory Therapists work with people suffering from [[cystic fibrosis]] in clinics and hospitals<ref>http://www.childrenshospital.vanderbilt.org/interior.php?mid=6618 Vanderbilt Children's Hospital Cystic Fibrosis Clinic</ref> by educating them about their disease and working with them on a treatment plan.   While admitted to a hospital, patients with cystic fibrosis have their treatment schedule modified and maintained by respiratory therapists.   Maintaining a healthy schedule for pharmokonetic and physical therapeutic airway clearance typically more frequent than home treatment plans because admissions are usually due to an increased need for therapy during the stay.

=== Cardiovascular perfusionist ===
[[Image:Coronary artery bypass surgery Image 657C-PH.jpg|thumb|CABG surgery with CPB]]
Respiratory Therapists are able to fulfill the role of Perfusionist with appropriate training.   The perfusionist is a highly trained member of the cardiothoracic surgical team which consists of [[cardiac surgeon]]s, [[anesthesiologist]]s, [[physician assistant]]s, [[surgical technician]]s, other [[respiratory therapist]]s, and [[nurse]]s.  The perfusionist's main responsibility is to support the physiological and metabolic needs of the cardiac surgical patient so that the [[cardiac surgeon]] may operate on a still, unbeating [[heart]].   Perfusionist certifications are maintained and awarded by The [[American Academy of Cardiovascular Perfusion]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abcp.org/cert_listing.htm | title=Clinical Perfusionists Currently Certified by the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion through December 31, 2010 | publisher=American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion | accessdate=2010-02-15}}</ref>

[[File:A Resperatory Therapist treating a newborn child Pulaski County Technical College Respiratory Therapist Program.jpg|thumb|A Respiratory Therapist takes a blood sample from a 3-day-old in preparation for transfer to an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation unit]]
[[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] (ECMO) is a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.  An ECMO Clinical Specialist is a technical specialist trained to manage the ECMO system including blood pump, tubing, artificial oxygenator, and related equipment.  The ECMO Specialist, under qualified medical direction and supervision, is also responsible for the clinical needs of the patient on ECMO which may include bedside management of oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal, maintenance of normal acid-base balance, administration of medications, blood and blood products, and maintenance of appropriate anticoagulation therapies for the blood.<ref name="pmid21944690">{{cite journal| author=Dalton HJ| title=Extracorporeal life support: moving at the speed of light.  | journal=[[Respiratory Care (journal)|Respiratory Care]] | year= 2011 | volume= 56 | issue= 9 | pages= 1445-53; discuiion 1453-6 | pmid=21944690 | doi=10.4187/respcare.01369 | pmc= | url= }}</ref><ref>http://www.wakehealth.edu/ecmo/ Wake Forrest Baptist Health</ref>  This ECMO Clinical Specialist may be the bedside critical care nurse specifically trained in ECMO patient and circuit management,<ref name="Organization Guidelines, B,6 Version 1.7">{{cite web|last=Extracorporeal Life Support Organization|first=ELSO|title=ELSO Guidelines for ECMO Centers|url=http://www.elso.med.umich.edu/WordForms/ELSO%20Guidelines%20For%20ECMO%20Centers.pdf|publisher=University of Michigan Health System|accessdate=February 2010}}</ref> or the ECMO system may be primarily managed by a [[registered respiratory therapist]],<ref>{{Citation  | last = [[American Association for Respiratory Care]]  | title = respiratory therapists as Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Specialists  | date =  | origyear =8/3/98  | year = 07  | month = 07  | url = http://www.aarc.org/resources/position_statements/ecmo.html }}</ref> or physicians with training as ECMO clinical specialists.<ref name="Organization Guidelines, B,6 Version 1.7"/>

== History of respiratory care ==
The [[Timeline of respiratory therapy|profession of respiratory care]] was officially established over 60 years ago;<ref name="pmid19245732">{{cite journal| author=Kacmarek RM, Durbin CG, Barnes TA, Kageler WV, Walton JR, O'Neil EH| title=Creating a vision for respiratory care in 2015 and beyond.  | journal=[[Respiratory Care (journal)|Respiratory Care]] | year= 2009 | volume= 54 | issue= 3 | pages= 375–89 | pmid=19245732 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref> and respiratory research has officially existed since the early 1900s.<ref name="smother">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Smother Small Dog To See it Revived.

Today the profession hardly resembles what it was in the 1940s.  Respiratory Therapists provide direct care, patient education, and care coordination.   They are academically trained in respiratory nursing and respiratory medicine.   They practice in acute care facilities, long-term acute care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, assisted-living centers, subacute care units, rehabilitation centers, diagnostics units, and in the home.<ref>American Association for Respir Care.  Position statement.  Definition of respiratory care.  December 2006.  http://www.aarc.org/resources/position_statements/defin.html.  Accessed January 7, 2009</ref>  respiratory therapist training has also dramatically changed.  Current accreditation standards require respiratory therapists to have, at minimum, an [[Associate of Science in Respiratory Care]] degree from an accredited program.<ref>Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs.  Standards and guidelines for the profession of respiratory care.  2003.  http://www.caahep.org/documents/forprogramdirectors/rt_standards.pdf.

Most states that have a licensure requirement also require continuing education.
