His son [[Patrick Wilson (astronomer)|Patrick Wilson]] succeeded him as [[Regius Professor of Practical Astronomy]] at [[Glasgow University]], in 1784.

==Early life==
Wilson was born in [[St. Andrews]], Fife, the son of Patrick Wilson, the [[town clerk]]. Alexander was educated at the [[University of St. Andrews]] from where he graduated [[MA (Scotland)|MA]] in 1733, at the age of 18. 

He was first apprenticed to a physician in St Andrews where he became skilled in constructing mercury [[thermometer]]s in glass.  In 1737 he left for London, to make his fortune and found work as assistant to a French surgeon-[[apothecary]], which included caring for his patients. During this time he was introduced to [[Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll|Lord Isla]] who like Wilson was interested in astronomy, and Wilson constructed instruments for Isla during 1738. 

After visiting a type foundry with a friend in London, he had an idea for making better [[typeface]]s.  He and his friend John Baine returned to St Andrews in 1739, where they started a type-founding business in 1742.

==Glasgow University==
The company moved to [[Camlachie]], near [[Glasgow]] in 1744. In 1748 he was appointed type-founder to [[Glasgow University]]. In the following year the partnership with Baine was dissolved. Later his sons became partners.  He supplied types to the [[Foulis press]] making possible their beautiful and artistic publications. Among modern typefaces, [[Fontana (typeface)|Fontana]], [[Scotch Roman (typeface)|Scotch Roman]], and [[Wilson Greek]] are based on types cut by Alexander Wilson. His work can be seen, for example, at [http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/foulis/books1.htm Examples of Foulis Press Books]. 

In 1749 Wilson made the first recorded use of [[kite]]s in [[meteorology]] with his lodger, a 23-year-old Glasgow University student [[Thomas Melvill]], who went on to discover [[sodium light]]. They measured air temperature at various levels above the ground simultaneously with a train of kites. 

With the help of his friend Lord Isla, now the 3rd [[Duke of Argyle]], he was appointed in 1760 to the new chair of practical astronomy at the [[University of Glasgow]], which had recently built the [[Macfarlane Observatory]]. Wilson primarily made contributions to astronomy and meteorology, and posited that "what hinders the fixed stars from falling upon one another", the question that Newton had posed in his ''Opticks'' (1704), was that the entire universe rotated around its centre. This has been found to be true of the stars of the Galaxy, the then known universe, which rotates around a central black hole. It is not true for the galaxies of the Universe which is expanding.

Wilson noted that [[sunspot]]s viewed near the edge of the Sun's visible disk appear depressed below the solar surface, a phenomenon referred to as the [[Wilson effect]]. When the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] announced a prize to be awarded for the best essay on the nature of solar spots, Wilson submitted an entry. On 18 February 1772 the Academy presented Wilson with a gold medal<ref>Lomholt, Asger (1942) ''Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 1742–1942. Samlinger til Selskabets Historie'', volume I {{da icon}}. Copenhagen, Ejnar Munksgaard, page 67.</ref> for his work on sunspots.<ref>''Kiøbenhavnske Efterretninger om lærde Sager'' from Thursday 7 May 1772 (No. 19, p. 289). It reads: "In the Mathematics category it was found that Alexander Wilson, M.D., professor of Astronomy at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, deserved the prize; although his hypothesis about the solar spots is not deemed to have been sufficiently proven." ("I den Mathematiske Classe, hvor det Problem om Soel-Pletterne etc. var udsat, fandt man, at Alexander Wilson, M.D., Professor i Astronomien ved Universitetet i Glasgow i Scotland, havde fortient Præmium; Skiønt man ey anseer hans Hypothese over Soel-Pletterne at være tilstrækkelig beviist.")</ref>

The crater [[Wilson (crater)|Wilson]] on the Moon is named for him, [[Ralph Elmer Wilson]] and [[Charles Thomson Rees Wilson|CTR Wilson]].

He, and his second son Patrick (Peter) Wilson, were two of the founding members of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (RSE). Peter wrote a biographical article of his father which was published both in the ''Transactions of the RSE'' and ''Edinburgh Journal of Science'', now available on-line.
