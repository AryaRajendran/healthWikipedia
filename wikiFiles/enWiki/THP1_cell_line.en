'''THP1''' is a human [[monocyte|monocytic]] [[cell line]] derived from an [[acute monocytic leukemia]] patient. It is used to test [[leukemia]] cell lines in [[immunocytochemistry|immunocytochemical]] analysis of protein-protein interaction, and [[immunohistochemistry]].

== Cell Characteristics Growth Information ==
=== Characteristics ===

These cells show a large, round, single-cell morphology.

They are derived from the peripheral blood of a 1 year old human male with acute monocytic leukemia. Some of their characteristics are:
* They have [[Fc|Fc receptor]] and [[C3b receptor]]s and lack surface and cytoplasmic [[immunoglobulin]]s.
* They produce [[IL-1]].
* They stain positive for [[alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase]], produce [[lysozyme]]s and are [[phagocytose|phagocytic]] (both for latex beads and sensitized erythrocytes). 
* They can restore the response of purified [[T lymphocytes]] to [[Con A]].
* They show increased [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] production on phagocytosis and can be differentiated into macrophage-like cells using for example [[phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate]]  (commonly known as PMA or TPA). 
* Their [[HLA]] [[haplotype]] is either A2, A9; B5; DRw1 or DRw2.

=== Growth Information ===

This cell line can provide continuous culture, grown in suspension; [[Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium|RPMI]] 1640 + 10% FBS + 2mM L-Glutamine. The average doubling time is 35 to 50 hours.
You may also add 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) to inhibit bacterial contamination. Maintain cultures between 2-9x10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml. 37C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells are non-adhesive.

Hazard: Cell line of human origin. There is no evidence for the presence of infectious viruses or toxic products. However, it is recommended that cultures are handled under Biosafety Level 2 containment.
