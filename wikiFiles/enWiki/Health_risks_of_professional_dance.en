The '''health risks of professional dance''' (and particularly with the more strenuous forms of [[ballet]] and [[contemporary dance]]) are those generally found in [[sports injury|sports injuries]]. Dancers risk injury within the course of their career, many retiring from active performance in their mid to late 30s. Since dance is a [[performance art]] with emphasis on [[aesthetics]], dancers are also at a higher risk of [[body image]] problems and [[eating disorders]] such as [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia]].

==Injuries==
{{rquote|right|...compared to the 61 common sports, only professional [American] football is more physically demanding than ballet.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/health-info/docs/1700/1799.asp?index=7779&src=news | title = Ballet: Ideal Body Type | accessdate = 2006-10-05 | author = The Cleveland Clinic Foundation | date = 2004-01-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060826234633/http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/health-info/docs/1700/1799.asp?index=7779&src=news <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-08-26}}</ref>}}
Many dance [[Movement (music)|movements]], and particularly [[ballet technique]]s, such as the [[Turnout (ballet)|turnout]] of the hips and rising on the toes ([[en pointe]]), test the limits of the range of movement of the human body. Dance movements can place stress on the body when not performed correctly; even if perfect form is used, over-repetition can cause [[repetitive strain injury]]. Eighty percent of professional dancers will be injured in some way during their careers; 50 percent of dancers from large ballet companies and 40 percent from small companies will miss performances due to injury.<ref>{{cite web| last =Machleder| first =Elaine| year=2000| url =http://www.dancespirit.com/backissues/jul_aug00/avoidinjury.shtml| title = Avoiding Injury: It’s A Science| publisher = Dance Spirit Magazine| accessdate =2006-05-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060319092055/http://www.dancespirit.com/backissues/jul_aug00/avoidinjury.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-03-19}}</ref> The practice of "[[Glossary of ballet#Plié|plie]]ing" (bending one's knees deeply) after landing each jump may seem innocuous, but failing to do so may result in [[shin splints]] or knee injuries. Overwork and poor [[occupational health and safety]] conditions, a (non-[[sprung floor|sprung]]) hard floor, a cold studio or theater, or dancing without sufficient [[warm up]] also increase risk of injury.

To minimize injury, dance training emphasizes strength building and forming appropriate [[Habit (psychology)|habit]]s. Also damage may result from having a student perform movements for which they are not prepared, care must be taken that the student is not "pushed" inappropriately. A dancer put [[en pointe]] at an age where his or her bones have not completely [[ossified]] may develop permanent damage; even past the point of ossification, ankle injuries can result if a dancer goes en pointe without sufficient strength.

==Stress==
Professional dancers may experience [[chronic stress|chronic]] [[workplace stress]] with an uncertain work situation. The average income for a ballet dancer is low,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.edonline.com/collegecompass/oohb0107.htm | title=Occupational Overview for Dancers and Choreographers | publisher=College Compass}}</ref> and competition for jobs is very high. In addition to the stress that may be caused by this, dancers also may experience the psychological distress from technical and physical "[[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]]".

As with other activities (such as [[jockey|horse jockeying]]) where weight is a factor, dancers are at a higher risk for developing eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maloney MJ |title=Anorexia nervosa and bulimia in dancers. Accurate diagnosis and treatment planning |journal=Clin Sports Med |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=549–55 |year=1983 |month=November |pmid=6580964 }}</ref> Many young dancers, believing that the ideal dancer must be thin, may begin controlling their diets, sometimes obsessively.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000066238 |author=Bettle N, Bettle O, Neumärker U, Neumärker KJ |title=Adolescent ballet school students: their quest for body weight change |journal=Psychopathology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=153–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9636944 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=psp31153}}</ref> Such dancers may be unaware of or may choose to ignore the fact that an [[emaciation|emaciated]] dancer will not have the strength required for ballet and is at a higher risk for injuries and long-term health problems. It is also highly relevant that inadequate nutrition in adolescent females has been linked to development of scoliosis, due to decreased oestrogen production and subsequent reduced bone density.

In a survey of 300 professional dancers, 40% were [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco smokers]] in contrast with the [[Center for Disease Control]] average of 24% of American women and 29% of American men aged 18–34.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/NSicherman/Research/getpaper.cfm/Why.Do.Dancers.Smoke.pdf?Article=Why.Do.Dancers.Smoke.pdf | title = Why Do Dancers Smoke? | accessdate = 2006-10-05 | coauthors = Lalith Munasinghe, Nachum Sicherman | year = 2005 | month = February | format = [[PDF]]}}</ref>
