'''Alopecia universalis''' or '''alopecia areata universalis''' is a [[medical condition]] involving rapid loss of all hair, including [[eyebrow]]s and [[eyelash]]es.  It is the most severe form of [[alopecia areata]], with an [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of .001% (1 in 100,000). {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==Causes==
Alopecia universalis can occur at any age, and is currently believed to be an [[autoimmune disorder]].<ref name="pmid17941369">{{cite journal |author=Robins DN |title=Case reports: alopecia universalis: hair growth following initiation of simvastatin and ezetimibe therapy |journal=Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=946–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17941369 |doi=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no standard treatment for alopecia universalis.  Many treatments have been explored, including [[immunomodulatory]] agents such as [[imiquimod]].<ref name="pmid17388216">{{cite journal |author=Letada PR, Sparling JD, Norwood C |title=Imiquimod in the treatment of alopecia universalis |journal=Cutis; cutaneous medicine for the practitioner |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=138–40 |year=2007 |pmid=17388216 |doi=}}</ref>

Alopecia universalis may be acute and short-lived or remain permanently. Regrowth is always a possibility, even for those with 100% hair loss over many years. However, it is not possible to predict when regrowth will occur.<ref>http://www.hairlosstalk.com/alopecia/alopecia-universalis.php</ref>
