'''Biofeedback''' is the process of gaining greater awareness of many [[physiology|physiological]] functions primarily using instruments that provide information on the activity of those same systems, with a goal of being able to manipulate them at will.<ref>{{cite book |author=Durand, Vincent Mark; Barlow, David |title=Abnormal psychology: an integrative approach |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |location=Belmont, CA |year=2009 |pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=Mo_q4zFVNo4C&pg=PA331 331] |isbn=0-495-09556-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name = AAPB>{{cite web | url = http://www.aapb.org/ | title = What is biofeedback?  | publisher = [[Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback]] | accessdate = 2010-02-22 | date = 2008-05-18 }}{{tl|dead link}}</ref>  Some of the processes that can be controlled include [[Electroencephalography|brainwaves]], [[muscle tone]], [[skin conductance]], [[heart rate]] and [[pain]] perception.<ref>{{cite journal |author=deCharms RC, Maeda F, Glover GH, ''et al.'' |title=Control over brain activation and pain learned by using real-time functional MRI |journal=Proc.

Biofeedback may be used to improve health, performance, and the physiological changes which often occur in conjunction with changes to thoughts, emotions, and behavior.  Eventually, these changes may be maintained without the use of extra equipment, even though no equipment is necessarily required to practice biofeedback.<ref name = AAPB/>

Biofeedback has been found to be effective for the treatment of [[headache]]s and [[migraine]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nestoriuc Y, Martin A |title=Efficacy of biofeedback for migraine: a meta-analysis |journal=Pain |volume=128 |issue=1–2 |pages=111–27 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17084028 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2006.09.007 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Nestoriuc Y, Martin A, Rief W, Andrasik F |title=Biofeedback treatment for headache disorders: a comprehensive efficacy review |journal=Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=125–40 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18726688 |doi=10.1007/s10484-008-9060-3 |url=}}</ref>

==Definition==
Three professional biofeedback organizations, the [[Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback]] (AAPB), [[Biofeedback Certification International Alliance]] (BCIA), and the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research (ISNR), arrived at a consensus definition of biofeedback in 2008:
{{cquote|is a process that enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance. Precise instruments measure physiological activity such as brainwaves, heart function, breathing, muscle activity, and skin temperature. These instruments rapidly and accurately 'feed back' information to the user. The presentation of this information&nbsp;— often in conjunction with changes in thinking, emotions, and behavior&nbsp;— supports desired physiological changes. Over time, these changes can endure without continued use of an instrument.<ref name = AAPB/>}}

==Sensor modalities==
===Electromyograph===
An [[electromyograph]] ([[Electromyography|EMG]]) uses surface electrodes to detect muscle action potentials from underlying skeletal muscles that initiate muscle contraction. Clinicians record the surface electromyogram (SEMG) using one or more active electrodes that are placed over a target muscle and a reference electrode that is placed within six inches of either active. The SEMG is measured in [[microvolt]]s (millionths of a volt).<ref>Tassinary, L. G., Cacioppo, J. T., & Vanman, E. J. (2007). The skeletomotor system: Surface electromyography. In J. T. Cacioppo, L.

Biofeedback therapists use EMG biofeedback when treating [[anxiety]] and [[worry]], [[chronic pain]], computer-related disorder, [[essential hypertension]], [[headache]] ([[migraine]], mixed headache, and [[tension-type headache]]), [[low back pain]], [[physical rehabilitation]] ([[cerebral palsy]], incomplete spinal cord lesions, and [[stroke]]), [[temporomandibular joint disorder]] (TMD), [[torticollis]], and [[fecal incontinence]], [[urinary incontinence]], and [[pelvic pain]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Peper | first = E | coauthors = Gibney KH | year = 2006 | title = Muscle biofeedback at the computer: A manual to prevent repetitive strain injury (RSI) by taking the guesswork out of assessment, monitoring, and training | location = Amersfoort, The Netherlands | publisher = BFE | url = http://www.aapb.org/tl_files/AAPB/files/biof_35_2_biofeedback.pdf | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20101019023511/http://aapb.org/tl_files/AAPB/files/biof_35_2_biofeedback.pdf | archivedate = 2010-10-19 | format = PDF }}</ref><ref name = Yucha2008>{{cite book | last = Yucha | first = C | coauthors = Montgomery D | year = 2008 | title = Evidence-based practice in biofeedback and neurofeedback | location =Wheat Ridge, CO | publisher = AAPB | url = http://www.isnr.org/uploads/EvidenceBasedYuchaMontgomeryW.pdf | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20101009135554/http://isnr.org/uploads/EvidenceBasedYuchaMontgomeryW.pdf | archivedate = 2010-10-09 | format = PDF }}</ref>

===Feedback thermometer===
A feedback thermometer detects skin temperature with a [[thermistor]] (a temperature-sensitive resistor) that is usually attached to a finger or toe and measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. Skin temperature mainly reflects [[arteriole]] diameter. Hand-warming and hand-cooling are produced by separate mechanisms, and their regulation involves different skills.<ref name="Andreassi, J. L. 2007">Andreassi, J. L. (2007). ''Psychophysiology: Human behavior and physiological response'' (5th ed.). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum and Associates, Inc.</ref> Hand-warming involves arteriole [[vasodilation]] produced by a beta-2 adrenegeric hormonal mechanism.<ref>Cohen, R. A., & Coffman, J. D. (1981).

Biofeedback therapists use temperature biofeedback when treating [[chronic pain]], [[edema]], [[headache]] ([[migraine]] and [[tension-type headache]]), [[essential hypertension]], [[Raynaud's phenomenon|Raynaud’s disease]], [[anxiety]], and [[Stress (biology)|stress]].<ref name = Yucha2008/>

===Electrodermograph===
An electrodermograph (EDG) measures skin electrical activity directly (skin conductance and skin potential) and indirectly (skin resistance) using electrodes placed over the digits or hand and wrist. Orienting responses to unexpected stimuli, arousal and worry, and cognitive activity can increase [[eccrine]] sweat gland activity, increasing the conductivity of the skin for electrical current.<ref name="Andreassi, J. L. 2007"/>
  	
In ''skin conductance'', an electrodermograph imposes an imperceptible current across the skin and measures how easily it travels through the skin. When anxiety raises the level of sweat in a sweat duct, conductance increases. Skin conductance is measured in microsiemens (millionths of a [[siemens (unit)|siemens]]). In ''skin potential'', a therapist places an active electrode over an active site (e.g., the palmar surface of the hand) and a reference electrode over a relatively inactive site (e.g., forearm). Skin potential is the voltage that develops between eccrine sweat glands and internal tissues and is measured in millivolts (thousandths of a volt). In ''skin resistance'', also called [[galvanic skin response]] (GSR), an electrodermograph imposes a current across the skin and measures the amount of opposition it encounters. Skin resistance is measured in kΩ (thousands of ohms).<ref>Dawson, M. E., Schell, A. M., & Filion, D. L. (2007). The electrodermal system. In J. T. Cacioppo, L. G. Tassinary, & G. G. Berntson (Eds.).

===Electroencephalograph===
An [[electroencephalograph]] (EEG) measures the electrical activation of the brain from scalp sites located over the human cortex.  The EEG shows the amplitude of electrical activity at each cortical site, the amplitude and relative power of various wave forms at each site, and the degree to which each cortical site fires in conjunction with other cortical sites (coherence and symmetry).<ref>Kropotov, J. D. (2009). Quantitative EEG, event-related potentials and neurotherapy. San Diego, CA: Academic Press.</ref>

The EEG uses precious metal electrodes to detect a voltage between at least two electrodes located on the scalp. The EEG records both excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) that largely occur in dendrites in pyramidal cells located in macrocolumns, several millimeters in diameter, in the upper cortical layers. [[Neurofeedback]] monitors both slow and fast cortical potentials.<ref name="Thompson, M. 2003">Thompson, M., & Thompson, L. (2003). ''The biofeedback book: An introduction to basic concepts in applied psychophysiology.'' Wheat Ridge, CO: Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback.</ref>

Slow cortical potentials are gradual changes in the membrane potentials of cortical dendrites that last from 300 ms to several seconds. These potentials include the [[contingent negative variation]] (CNV), [[readiness potential]], [[movement-related potentials]] (MRPs), and [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]] and [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] potentials.<ref name="Stern, R. M. 2001">Stern, R. M., Ray, W. J., & Quigley, K. S. (2001). ''Psychophysiological recording'' (2nd ed.). New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>

Fast cortical potentials range from 0.5&nbsp;Hz to 100&nbsp;Hz.<ref>LaVaque, T. J. (2003). Neurofeedback, Neurotherapy, and quantitative EEG. In D. Moss, A. McGrady, T. Davies, & I. Wickramasekera (Eds), ''Handbook of mind-body medicine for primary care'' (pp. 123-136). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref> The main frequency ranges include delta, theta, alpha, the sensorimotor rhythm, low beta, high beta, and gamma. The specific cutting points defining the frequency ranges vary considerably among professionals. Fast cortical potentials can be described by their predominant frequencies, but also by whether they are synchronous or asynchronous wave forms. Synchronous wave forms occur at regular periodic intervals, whereas asynchronous wave forms are irregular.<ref name="Thompson, M. 2003"/>

The synchronous [[delta rhythm]] ranges from 0.5 to 3.5&nbsp;Hz. Delta is the dominant frequency from ages 1 to 2, and is associated in adults with deep sleep and brain pathology like trauma and tumors, and learning disability.

The synchronous [[theta rhythm]] ranges from 4 to 7&nbsp;Hz. Theta is the dominant frequency in healthy young children and is associated with drowsiness or starting to sleep, REM sleep, hypnagogic imagery (intense imagery experienced before the onset of sleep), hypnosis, attention, and processing of cognitive and perceptual information.

The synchronous [[alpha rhythm]] ranges from 8 to 13&nbsp;Hz and is defined by its waveform and not by its frequency. Alpha activity can be observed in about 75% of awake, relaxed individuals and is replaced by low-amplitude desynchronized beta activity during movement, complex problem-solving, and visual focusing. This phenomenon is called alpha blocking.

The synchronous [[sensorimotor rhythm]] (SMR) ranges from 12 to 15&nbsp;Hz and is located over the sensorimotor cortex (central sulcus). The sensorimotor rhythm is associated with the inhibition of movement and reduced muscle tone.

The [[beta rhythm]] consists of asynchronous waves and can be divided into low beta and high beta ranges (13–21&nbsp;Hz and 20–32&nbsp;Hz). Low beta is associated with activation and focused thinking. High beta is associated with [[anxiety]], [[hypervigilance]], [[panic]], peak performance, and [[worry]].

EEG activity from 36 to 44&nbsp;Hz is also referred to as gamma. Gamma activity is associated with perception of meaning and meditative awareness.<ref name="Thompson, M. 2003"/><ref>Steriade, M.

===Photoplethysmograph===
[[File:EmWave2, powering up.jpg|thumb|upright|An ''emWave2'' photoplethysmograph for monitoring heart rate variability]]

A [[photoplethysmograph]] (PPG) measures the relative blood flow through a digit using a photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor attached by a Velcro band to the fingers or to the temple to monitor the [[temporal artery]]. An infrared light source is transmitted through or reflected off the tissue, detected by a phototransistor, and quantified in arbitrary units. Less light is absorbed when blood flow is greater, increasing the intensity of light reaching the sensor.<ref name="Combatalade, D. 2009">Combatalade, D. (2009). ''Basics of heart rate variability applied to psychophysiology''. Montreal, Canada: Thought Technology Ltd.</ref>

A photoplethysmograph can measure blood volume pulse (BVP), which is the phasic change in blood volume with each heartbeat, [[heart rate]], and [[heart rate variability]] (HRV), which consists of beat-to-beat differences in intervals between successive heartbeats.<ref name="Lehrer, P. M. 2007 P. M">Lehrer, P. M. (2007). Biofeedback training to increase heart rate variability. In P. M. Lehrer, R. M. Woolfolk, & W. E. Sime (Eds.).

A photoplethysmograph can provide useful feedback when temperature feedback shows minimal change. This is because the PPG sensor is more sensitive than a thermistor to minute blood flow changes.<ref name="Shaffer" />  Biofeedback therapists can use a photoplethysmograph to supplement temperature biofeedback when treating [[chronic pain]], [[edema]], [[headache]] ([[migraine]] and [[tension-type headache]]), [[essential hypertension]], Raynaud’s disease, [[anxiety]], and [[Stress (biology)|stress]].<ref name = Yucha2008/>

===Electrocardiograph===
The [[electrocardiograph]] (ECG) uses electrodes placed on the torso, wrists, or legs, to measure the electrical activity of the heart and measures the [[interbeat interval]] (distances between successive [[R-wave]] peaks in the [[QRS complex]]). The interbeat interval, divided into 60 seconds, determines the heart rate at that moment. The statistical variability of that interbeat interval is what we call [[heart rate variability]].<ref>Berntson, G. G., Quigley, K. S., & Lozano, D. (2007). Cardiovascular psychophysiology. In J. T. Cacioppo, L. G. Tassinary, & G. G. Berntson, (Eds.). ''Handbook of psychophysiology'' (3rd ed.).

===Pneumograph===
A [[pneumograph]] or respiratory strain gauge uses a flexible sensor band that is placed around the chest, abdomen, or both. The strain gauge method can provide feedback about the relative expansion/contraction of the chest and abdomen, and can measure [[respiration rate]] (the number of breaths per minute).<ref name="Stern, R. M. 2001"/> Clinicians can use a pneumograph to detect and correct dysfunctional breathing patterns and behaviors. Dysfunctional breathing patterns include [[clavicular breathing]] (breathing that primarily relies on the [[external intercostals]] and the [[accessory muscles of respiration]] to inflate the lungs), [[reverse breathing]] (breathing where the abdomen expands during exhalation and contracts during inhalation), and [[thoracic breathing]] (shallow breathing that primarily relies on the external intercostals to inflate the lungs). Dysfunctional breathing behaviors include [[apnea]] (suspension of breathing), gasping, sighing, and wheezing.<ref name="Peper, E. 2008">Peper, E., Tylova, H., Gibney, K.

===Capnometer===
A [[capnometer]] or [[capnograph]] uses an infrared detector to measure end-tidal {{chem|CO|2}} (the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in expired air at the end of expiration) exhaled through the nostril into a latex tube. The average value of end-tidal {{chem|CO|2}} for a resting adult is 5% ({{convert|36|torr|kPa|abbr=on|disp=or}}). A capnometer is a sensitive index of the quality of patient breathing. Shallow, rapid, and effortful breathing lowers {{chem|CO|2}}, while deep, slow, effortless breathing increases it.<ref name="Peper, E. 2008"/>

===Rheoencephalograph===

[[Rheoencephalography]] (REG), or brain blood flow biofeedback, is a biofeedback technique of a conscious control of blood flow. An electronic device called a [[rheoencephalograph]] [from Greek rheos stream, anything flowing, from rhein to flow] is utilized in brain blood flow biofeedback. Electrodes are attached to the skin at certain points on the head and permit the device to measure continuously the electrical conductivity of the tissues of structures located between the electrodes. The brain blood flow technique is based on non-invasive method of measuring bio-impedance. Changes in bio-impedance are generated by blood volume and blood flow and registered by a rheographic device.<ref>Tokarev V.E. "A Rheoencephalogram (REG) Variability System Based on ISKRA-226 Personal Computer", Institute for Complex Problem of Hygiene Healthcare Conference, Novokuznetsk, Russia, 1989, p.115-116.</ref> The pulsative bio-impedance changes directly reflect the total blood flow of the deep structures of brain due to high frequency impedance measurements.<ref>Tokarev V.E.

===Hemoencephalography===
[[Hemoencephalography]] or HEG biofeedback is a functional [[infrared]] imaging technique. As its name describes, it measures the differences in the color of light reflected back through the scalp based on the relative amount of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood in the brain. Research continues to determine its reliability, validity, and clinical applicability. HEG is used to treat [[ADHD]] and [[migraine]], and for research.<ref>Toomim, H., & Carmen, J. (2009).

==Applications==
===Urinary incontinence===
Mowrer detailed the use of a bedwetting alarm that sounds when children urinate while asleep. This simple biofeedback device can quickly teach children to wake up when their bladders are full and to contract the urinary sphincter and relax the detrusor muscle, preventing further urine release. Through classical conditioning, sensory feedback from a full bladder replaces the alarm and allows children to continue sleeping without urinating.<ref>Mowrer, O. H. (1960). ''Learning theory and behavior''. New York: Wiley.</ref>

[[Arnold Kegel|Kegel]] developed the perineometer in 1947 to treat [[urinary incontinence]] (urine leakage) in women whose pelvic floor muscles are weakened during pregnancy and childbirth.

Research has shown that biofeedback can improve the efficacy of [[pelvic floor exercise]]s and help restore proper bladder functions. The mode of action of [[vaginal cones]], for instance involves a biological biofeedback mechanism. Studies have shown that biofeedback obtained with vaginal cones is as effective as biofeedback induced through physiotherapy electrostimulation.<ref>3Olah et al, The conservative management of patients with symptoms of stress incontinence: a randomized, prospective study comparing weighted vaginal cones and interferential therapy.

In 1992, the United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research recommended biofeedback as a first-line treatment for adult urinary incontinence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Busby-Whitehead , Johnson T., Clarke M.

===Fecal incontinence and anismus===
Biofeedback is a major treatment for [[anismus]] (paradoxical contraction of puborectalis during defecation). This therapy directly evolved from the investigation [[anorectal manometry]] where a probe that can record pressure is placed in the anal canal. Biofeedback therapy is also a commonly used and researched therapy for [[fecal incontinence]], but the benefits are uncertain.<ref name="Norton 2012">{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=C|coauthors=Cody, JD|title=Biofeedback and/or sphincter exercises for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012 Jul 11|volume=7|pages=CD002111|pmid=22786479}}</ref> Biofeedback therapy varies in the way it is delivered. It is also unknown if one type has benefits over another.<ref name="Norton 2012" /> The aims have been described as either to enhance the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR), rectal sensitivity (by discrimination of progressively smaller volumes of a rectal balloon and promptly contracting the [[external anal sphincter]] (EAS)) or the strength and endurance of the EAS contraction. Three general types of biofeedback have been described, though they are not mutually exclusive, with many protocols combining these elements.<ref name="Norton 2012" /> Similarly there is variance of the length of both the individual sessions and the overall length of the training, and if home exercises are performed in addition and how. In rectal sensitivity training, a balloon is placed in the rectum, and is gradually distended until there is a sensation of rectal filling. Successively smaller volume reinflations of the balloon aim to help the person detect rectal distension at a lower threshold, giving more time to contract the EAS and prevent incontinence, or to journey to the toiled. Alternatively, in those with urge incontinence/ rectal hypersensitivity, training is aimed at teaching the person to tolerate progressively larger volumes. Strength training may involve electromyography (EMG) skin electrodes, manometric pressures, intra-anal EMG, or [[endoanal ultrasound]]. One of these measures are used to relay the muscular activity or anal canal pressure during anal sphincter exercise. Performance and progress can be monitored in this manner. Co-ordination training involves the placing of 3 balloons, in the rectum and in the upper and lower anal canal. The rectal balloon is inflated to trigger the RAIR, an event often followed by incontinence. Co-ordination training aims to teach voluntary contraction of EAS when the RAIR occurs (i.e. when there is rectal distension).<ref name="Norton 2012" />

[[Hans Berger|Berger]] (1924) published the first human EEG data. He recorded electrical potentials from his son Klaus's scalp. At first he believed that he had discovered the physical mechanism for telepathy but was disappointed that the electromagnetic variations disappear only millimeters away from the skull. (He did continue to believe in telepathy throughout his life, however, having had a particularly confirming event regarding his sister). He viewed the EEG as analogous to the ECG and introduced the term elektenkephalogram. He believed that the EEG had diagnostic and therapeutic promise in measuring the impact of clinical interventions. Berger showed that these potentials were not due to scalp muscle contractions. He first identified the alpha rhythm, which he called the Berger rhythm, and later identified the beta rhythm and [[sleep spindles]]. He demonstrated that alterations in consciousness are associated with changes in the EEG and associated the beta rhythm with alertness. He described interictal activity (EEG potentials between seizures) and recorded a partial complex seizure in 1933. Finally, he performed the first QEEG, which is the measurement of the signal strength of EEG frequencies.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Berger H | year = 1920 | title = Ueber das elektroenkephalogramm des menschen | url = | journal = Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 527–570 | doi = 10.1007/BF01797193 }}</ref>

[[Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian|Adrian]] and [[Bryan Harold Cabot Matthews|Matthews]] confirmed Berger's findings in 1934 by recording their own EEGs using a cathode-ray oscilloscope. Their demonstration of EEG recording at the 1935 Physiological Society meetings in England caused its widespread acceptance. Adrian used himself as a subject and demonstrated the phenomenon of alpha blocking, where opening his eyes suppressed alpha rhythms.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Adrian E. D., Mathews B. H.

[[Frederic A. Gibbs|Gibbs]], [[Hallowell Davis|Davis]], and [[William Gordon Lennox|Lennox]] inaugurated clinical electroencephalography in 1935 by identifying abnormal EEG rhythms associated with epilepsy, including [[interictal]] spike waves and 3&nbsp;Hz activity in [[absence seizures]].<ref name="Brazier, M.

[[William Grey Walter|Walter]] (1937, 1953) named the [[delta waves]] and [[theta waves]], and the [[contingent negative variation]] (CNV), a slow cortical potential that may reflect expectancy, motivation, intention to act, or attention. He located an [[occipital lobe]] source for alpha waves and demonstrated that delta waves can help locate brain lesions like tumors.

Kleitman has been recognized as the "Father of American sleep research" for his seminal work in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles, [[circadian rhythms]], the sleep patterns of different age groups, and the effects of [[sleep deprivation]]. He discovered the phenomenon of [[rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] (REM) sleep with his graduate student Aserinsky in 1953.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kleitman N | year = 1960 | title = Patterns of dreaming | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 203 | issue = 5| pages = 82–88 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1160-82 }}</ref>

Dement, another of Kleitman's students, described the EEG architecture and phenomenology of sleep stages and the transitions between them in 1955, associated REM sleep with dreaming in 1957, and documented sleep cycles in another species, cats, in 1958, which stimulated basic sleep research. He established the Stanford University Sleep Research Center in 1970.<ref>Dement, W. (2000).

Andersen and Andersson (1968) proposed that thalamic pacemakers project synchronous alpha rhythms to the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] via thalamocortical circuits.<ref>Andersen, P., & Andersson, S. (1968). ''A physiological basis of the alpha rhythm''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.</ref>

Kamiya (1968) demonstrated that the alpha rhythm in humans could be [[operant]]ly conditioned. He published an influential article in ''Psychology Today'' that summarized research that showed that subjects could learn to discriminate when alpha was present or absent, and that they could use feedback to shift the dominant alpha frequency about 1&nbsp;Hz. Almost half of his subjects reported experiencing a pleasant "alpha state" characterized as an "alert calmness." These reports may have contributed to the perception of alpha biofeedback as a shortcut to a meditative state. He also studied the EEG correlates of meditative states.<ref>Kamiya, J. (1969). [[Operant]] control of the EEG alpha rhythm. In C. Tart (Ed.), ''Altered states of consciousness''. NY: Wiley.</ref>

Brown (1970) demonstrated the clinical use of alpha-theta biofeedback. In research designed to identify the subjective states associated with EEG rhythms, she trained subjects to increase the abundance of alpha, beta, and theta activity using visual feedback and recorded their subjective experiences when the amplitude of these frequency bands increased. She also helped popularize biofeedback by publishing a series of books, including ''New Mind, New body'' (1974) and ''Stress and the Art of Biofeedback'' (1977).<ref>Brown, B. (1974).

Mulholland and Peper (1971) showed that occipital alpha increases with eyes open and not focused, and is disrupted by visual focusing; a rediscovery of alpha blocking.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mulholland T., Peper E. | year = 1971 | title = Occipital alpha and accommodative vergence, pursuit tracking, and fast eye movements | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 556–575 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.1971.tb00491.x | pmid = 5116820 }}</ref>

Green and Green (1986) investigated voluntary control of internal states by individuals like Swami Rama and American Indian medicine man Rolling Thunder both in India and at the [[Menninger Foundation]]. They brought portable biofeedback equipment to India and monitored practitioners as they demonstrated self-regulation. A film containing footage from their investigations was released as ''Biofeedback: The Yoga of the West'' (1974). They developed alpha-theta training at the Menninger Foundation from the 1960s to the 1990s. They hypothesized that theta states allow access to unconscious memories and increase the impact of prepared images or suggestions. Their alpha-theta research fostered Peniston's development of an alpha-theta addiction protocol.<ref name="Green, E. 1977">Green, E., & Green, A. (1977). ''Beyond biofeedback''.

Sterman (1972) showed that cats and human subjects could be operantly trained to increase the amplitude of the [[sensorimotor rhythm]] (SMR) recorded from the sensorimotor cortex. He demonstrated that SMR production protects cats against drug-induced generalized seizures (tonic-clonic seizures involving loss of consciousness) and reduces the frequency of seizures in humans diagnosed with [[epilepsy]]. He found that his SMR protocol, which uses visual and auditory EEG biofeedback, normalizes their EEGs (SMR increases while theta and beta decrease toward normal values) even during sleep. Sterman also co-developed the Sterman-Kaiser (SKIL) QEEG database.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sterman M.

Birbaumer and colleagues (1981) have studied feedback of slow cortical potentials since the late 1970s.

Lubar (1989) studied SMR biofeedback to treat attention disorders and epilepsy in collaboration with Sterman. He demonstrated that SMR training can improve attention and academic performance in children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity (ADHD).

[[Edmund Jacobson|Jacobson]] (1930) developed hardware to measure EMG voltages over time, showed that cognitive activity (like imagery) affects EMG levels, introduced the deep relaxation method Progressive Relaxation, and wrote ''Progressive Relaxation'' (1929) and ''You Must Relax'' (1934). He prescribed daily Progressive Relaxation practice to treat diverse psychophysiological disorders like hypertension.<ref>Jacobson, E. (1938). ''Progressive relaxation''.

"While Marinacci used EMG to treat neuromuscular disorders, his colleagues only used the EMG for diagnosis. They were unable to recognize its potential as a teaching tool even when the evidence stared them in the face!

Schultz and Luthe (1969) developed [[Autogenic Training]], which is a deep relaxation exercise derived from hypnosis.

Freedman and colleagues (1991) demonstrated that hand-warming and hand-cooling are produced by different mechanisms. The primary hand-warming mechanism is [[beta-adrenergic]] (hormonal), while the main hand-cooling mechanism is alpha-adrenergic and involves sympathetic C-fibers. This contradicts the traditional view that finger blood flow is exclusively controlled by sympathetic C-fibers. The traditional model asserts that when firing is slow, hands warm; when firing is rapid, hands cool. Freedman and colleagues’ studies support the view that hand-warming and hand-cooling represent entirely different skills.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Freedman R.

===Pain===
====Muscle pain====
Budzynski and Stoyva (1969) showed that EMG biofeedback could reduce [[frontalis muscle|frontalis]] muscle (forehead) contraction.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Budzynski T. H., Stoyva J.

McNulty, Gevirtz, Hubbard, and Berkoff (1994) proposed that [[sympathetic nervous system]] innervation of [[muscle spindles]] underlies [[trigger points]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = McNulty W.

====Tension headache====
Budzynski, Stoyva, Adler, and Mullaney (1973) reported that auditory frontalis EMG biofeedback combined with home relaxation practice lowered tension headache frequency and frontalis EMG levels. A control group that received noncontingent (false) auditory feedback did not improve. This study helped make the frontalis muscle the placement-of-choice in EMG assessment and treatment of headache and other psychophysiological disorders.<ref>Budzynski, T. H., Stoyva, J. M., Adler, C. S., & Mullaney, D. EMG biofeedback and tension headache: A controlled-outcome study. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 35'', 484-496.</ref>

====Migraine====
Sargent, Green, and Walters (1972, 1973) demonstrated that hand-warming could abort migraines and that autogenic biofeedback training could reduce headache activity. The early Menninger migraine studies, although methodologically weak (no pretreatment baselines, control groups, or random assignment to conditions), strongly influenced migraine treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sargent J.

====Phantom-limb pain====
Flor (2002) trained amputees to detect the location and frequency of shocks delivered to their stumps, which resulted in an expansion of corresponding cortical regions and significant reduction of their phantom limb pain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Flor H | year = 2002 | title = Phantom-limb pain: characteristics, causes, and treatment | url = | journal = The Lancet, Neurology | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 182–189 | doi = 10.1016/S1474-4422(02)00074-1 }}</ref>

===Stress reduction===
A randomized study by Sutarto et al. assessed the effect of resonant breathing biofeedback (recognize and control involuntary heart rate variability) among manufacturing operators; depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased.<ref name="Sutarto2012">{{cite journal|last=Sutarto|first=AP|coauthors=Wahab, MN; Zin NM|title=Resonant breathing biofeedback training for stress reduction among manufacturing operators|journal=Int J Occup Saf Ergon|date=2012|pages=549–61|doi=|pmid=23294659|volume=18|issue=4}}</ref>{{Primary source-inline|date=January 2013}}

==Clinical effectiveness==
===Research===
Moss, LeVaque, and Hammond (2004) observed that “Biofeedback and neurofeedback seem to offer the kind of evidence-based practice that the health care establishment is demanding."<ref>Geyman, J.

The [[Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback]] (AAPB) and the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research (ISNR) have collaborated in validating and rating treatment protocols to address questions about the clinical efficacy of biofeedback and neurofeedback applications, like ADHD and headache. In 2001, Donald Moss, then president of the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, and Jay Gunkelman, president of the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, appointed a task force to establish standards for the efficacy of biofeedback and neurofeedback.

The Task Force document was published in 2002,<ref name="LaVaque, T. J. 2002">{{cite journal | author = LaVaque T. J., Hammond D.

A broader review was published<ref>Yucha, C., & Gilbert, C. (2004). ''Evidence-based practice in biofeedback and neurofeedback''. Wheat Ridge, CO: Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback.</ref> and later updated,<ref name = Yucha2008/> applying the same efficacy standards to the entire range of medical and psychological disorders. The 2008 edition reviewed the efficacy of biofeedback for over 40 clinical disorders, ranging from alcoholism/substance abuse to [[vulvar vestibulitis]]. The ratings for each disorder depend on the nature of research studies available on each disorder, ranging from anecdotal reports to [[double blind]] studies with a [[control group]]. Thus, a lower rating may reflect the lack of research rather than the ineffectiveness of biofeedback for the problem.

The randomized trial by Dehli et al. compared if the injection of a bulking agent in the anal canal was superior to sphincter training with biofeedback to treat [[fecal incontinence]]. Both methods lead to an improvement of FI, but comparisons of [[Fecal_incontinence#Severity_scales|St Mark's scores]] between the groups showed no differences in effect between treatments.<ref name="Dehli2013">

===Efficacy===
Yucha and Montgomery's (2008) ratings are listed for the five levels of efficacy recommended by a joint Task Force and adopted by the Boards of Directors of the Association for Applied Psychophysiology (AAPB) and the International Society for Neuronal Regulation (ISNR).<ref name="LaVaque, T. J. 2002"/> From weakest to strongest, these levels include: not empirically supported, possibly efficacious, probably efficacious, efficacious, and efficacious and specific.

Level 1: '''Not empirically supported.''' This designation includes applications supported by anecdotal reports and/or case studies in non-peer reviewed venues. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned eating disorders, immune function, [[spinal cord injury]], and [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]] to this category.<ref name = Yucha2008/>

Level 2: '''Possibly efficacious.''' This designation requires at least one study of sufficient statistical power with well identified outcome measures but lacking randomized assignment to a control condition internal to the study. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned [[asthma]], [[autism]], [[Bell palsy]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[COPD]], [[coronary artery disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[erectile dysfunction]], [[fibromyalgia]], hand dystonia, [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[PTSD]], [[repetitive strain injury]], [[respiratory failure]], [[stroke]], [[tinnitus]], and [[urinary incontinence]] in children to this category.<ref name = Yucha2008/>

Level 3: '''Probably efficacious.''' This designation requires multiple observational studies, clinical studies, wait list controlled studies, and within subject and intrasubject replication studies that demonstrate efficacy. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned [[alcoholism]] and [[substance abuse]], [[arthritis]], [[diabetes mellitus]], fecal disorders in children, [[fecal incontinence]] in adults, [[insomnia]], pediatric headache, [[traumatic brain injury]], [[urinary incontinence]] in males, and [[vulvar vestibulitis]] ([[vulvodynia]]) to this category.<ref name = Yucha2008/>

Level 4: '''Efficacious.''' This designation requires the satisfaction of six criteria:

(a) In a comparison with a no-treatment control group, alternative treatment group, or sham (placebo) control using randomized assignment, the investigational treatment is shown to be statistically significantly superior to the control condition or the investigational treatment is equivalent to a treatment of established efficacy in a study with sufficient power to detect moderate differences.

(b) The studies have been conducted with a population treated for a specific problem, for whom inclusion criteria are delineated in a reliable, operationally defined manner.

(c) The study used valid and clearly specified outcome measures related to the problem being treated.

(d) The data are subjected to appropriate data analysis.

(e) The diagnostic and treatment variables and procedures are clearly defined in a manner that permits replication of the study by independent researchers.

(f) The superiority or equivalence of the investigational treatment has been shown in at least two independent research settings.

Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[anxiety]], [[chronic pain]], [[epilepsy]], [[constipation]] (adult), [[headache]] (adult), [[hypertension]], [[motion sickness]], [[Raynaud's disease]], and [[temporomandibular disorder]] to this category.<ref name = Yucha2008/>

Level 5: '''Efficacious and specific.''' The investigational treatment must be shown to be statistically superior to credible sham therapy, pill, or alternative bona fide treatment in at least two independent research settings. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned [[urinary incontinence]] (females) to this category.<ref name = Yucha2008/>

===Criticisms===
In a health care environment that emphasizes cost containment and evidence-based practice, biofeedback and neurofeedback professionals continue to address skepticism in the medical community about the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of their treatments. Critics question how these treatments compare with conventional behavioral and medical interventions on efficacy and cost. The publication of white papers and rigorous evaluation of biofeedback interventions can address these legitimate questions and educate medical professionals, third-party payers, and the public about the value of these services.<ref>Moss, D., & Andrasik, F.

'''Hinduism:'''

Biofeedback systems have been known in India and some other countries for millennia. Ancient Hindu practices like Yoga and Pranayama (Breathing techniques)are essentially biofeedback methods. Many yogis and sadhus have been known to exercise control over their physiological processes. In addition to recent research on Yoga, Paul Brunton, the British writer who travelled extensively in India, has written about many cases he has witnessed.

* Biofeedback data and biofeedback technology are used by Massimiliano Peretti in a contemporary art environment, the [[Amigdalae]] project.  This project explores the way in which emotional reactions filter and distort human [[perception]] and observation.  During the performance, biofeedback medical technology, such as the [[EEG]], [[body temperature]] variations, [[heart rate]], and galvanic responses, are used to analyze an  audience's emotions while they watch the video art.  Using these signals, the music changes so that the consequent sound environment simultaneously mirrors and influences the viewer's [[emotional state]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kontinuita.com/ |title=under changes |publisher=Kontinuita.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scope-art.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=102&Itemid=206 |title=Scope New York Home |publisher=Scope-art.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-09}}</ref>  More information is available at the website of the CNRS French National Center of Neural Research [http://cogimage.dsi.cnrs.fr/seminaires/resumes/resume_amygdalae_2005.htm].
* Charles Wehrenberg implemented ''competitive-relaxation'' as a gaming paradigm with the ''Will Ball Games'' circa 1973. In the first bio-mechanical versions, comparative GSR inputs monitored each player's relaxation response and moved the ''Will Ball'' across a playing field appropriately using stepper motors. In 1984 Wehrenberg programmed the ''Will Ball'' games for Apple II computers. The ''Will Ball'' game itself is described as pure ''competitive-relaxation''; ''Brain Ball'' is a duel between one player's left and right brain hemispheres; ''Mood Ball'' is an obstacle-based game; ''Psycho Dice'' is a psycho-kinetic game.<ref>Charles Wehrenberg ''Will Ball'', Solo Zone, San Francisco, 1995/2001 ISBN 1-886163-02-2</ref> In 1999 The HeartMath Institute developed an educational system based on heart rhythm measurement and display on a Personal Computer (Windows/Macintosh). Their systems have been copied by many but are still unique in the way they assist people to learn about  and self-manage their physiology. A handheld version of their system was released in 2006 and is completely portable being the size of a small mobile phone and having rechargeable batteries. With this unit one can move around and go about daily business while gaining feedback about inner psycho-physiological states.
* In 2001, the company [[Journey to Wild Divine]] began producing biofeedback hardware and software for the [[Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]]s. Third-party and open-source software and games are also available for the Wild Divine hardware. [[Tetris 64]] makes use of biofeedback to adjust the speed of the tetris puzzle game.
* [[David Rosenboom]] has worked to develop musical instruments that would respond to mental and physiological commands. Playing these instruments can be learned through a process of biofeedback.
* In the mid-seventies, an episode of the television series, "The Bionic Woman", featured a doctor who could "heal" himself using biofeedback techniques to communicate to his body and react to stimuli. For example, he could exhibit "super" powers, such as walking on hot coals, by feeling the heat on the sole of his feet and then convincing his body to react by sending large quantities of perspiration to compensate. He could also convince his body to deliver extremely high levels of adrenalin to provide more energy to allow him to run faster and jump higher. When injured, he could slow his heart rate to reduce blood pressure, send extra platelets to aid in clotting a wound, and direct white blood cells to an area to attack infection.[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0526163/]
