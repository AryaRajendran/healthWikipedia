The '''periodic fever syndromes''' (also known as '''autoinflammatory syndromes''') are a set of disorders, many of which are genetic disorders in which the mechanisms which initiate and control [[inflammation]] are disturbed, leading to uncontrolled inflammation throughout the body. The syndromes are diverse, but tend to cause fever, [[arthralgia|joint pains]], [[abdominal pain]]s and may lead to chronic complications such as [[amyloidosis]].<ref name="pmid16093838">{{cite journal |author=Stojanov S, Kastner DL |title=Familial autoinflammatory diseases: genetics, pathogenesis and treatment |journal=Curr Opin Rheumatol |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=586–99 |year=2005 |pmid=16093838 |doi=10.1097/bor.0000174210.78449.6b}}</ref>

Restated, autoinflammatory syndromes are a group of inherited disorders characterized by bouts of inflammatory skin lesions and periodic fevers.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{rp|148}}

Periodic fever syndromes are medically distinct from [[immunodeficiency]] conditions, in which infections can occur frequently and induce fever.

The autoinflammatory syndromes are of crucial importance for immunology in general.  These syndromes actually define diseases that are driven by the innate immune system.  Therefore, these conditions define the diametric genetic and immunopathological opposites of the classical autoimmune diseases that are driven by B and T cells.   These diseases actually define one boundary of the immulological disease continuum of inflammation against self.
