'''Waldmann disease''', also known as '''Waldmann's disease''' and '''Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia''', is a rare [[disease]]<ref name='nih'>{{cite web|url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Disease.aspx?PageID=4&DiseaseID=7873&expand=SupportGroups |title=Waldmann disease |accessdate=2009-06-11 }}</ref>  characterized by enlargement of the [[lymph vessels]] supplying the [[lamina propria]] of the [[small intestine]].<ref name='wdo'>{{cite pmid|15229406}}</ref> 

Although its prevalence is unknown, it being classified as a "rare disease" means that less than 200,000 of the population of the [[United States]] are affected by this condition and its subtypes.<ref name='nih'/><ref name='pubmed'>{{cite pmid|18294365}}</ref> 


==History==
The disease was first reported in 1961 by [[T.A. Waldmann]]. He described 18 cases of patients having a low level <sup>131</sup>I-albumin. Biopsies of the small intestine were examined under the microscope and found various levels of dilatation of the lymph vessels.<ref name='biop'>{{cite pmid|17229491}}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==

The illness is usually caused by lymphatic vessels that were misshaped at birth, causing obstruction and subsequent enlargement. The condition can also be a result of other illnesses such as [[constrictive pericarditis]] and [[pancreatitis]]. The disease is diagnosed by doing a [[biopsy]] of the affected area. Severity of the disease is then determined by measuring alpha<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin proteins in a [[stool sample]].<ref name='merck'/>

==Symptoms==

Symptoms of the disease include [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the legs, [[protein-losing enteropathy]], [[immunodeficiency]] and loss of [[lymphatic fluid]] into the intestines.<ref name='wdo'/><ref name='merck'>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/digestive_disorders/malabsorption/intestinal_lymphangiectasia.html |title= Intestinal Lymphangiectasia |accessdate=2009-06-11 |last=Ruiz |first=Atenodoro R. |publisher=[[Merck & Co.|Merck]] }}</ref> It is usually diagnosed before the patient is 3 years old, but it is sometimes diagnosed in adults.<ref name='pubmed'/>

==Management==
Once the main cause of the disease is treated, a diet of low-fat and high-protein aliments, supplemental [[calcium]] and certain [[vitamins]] has been shown to reduce symptom effects.<ref name='merck'/> This diet, however, is not a cure. If the diet is stopped, the symptoms will eventually reappear.<ref name='pubmed'/>
