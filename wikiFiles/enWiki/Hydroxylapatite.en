'''Hydroxylapatite''', also called '''hydroxyapatite''' (HA), is a naturally occurring [[mineral]] form of calcium [[apatite]] with the formula Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(OH), but is usually written Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> to denote that the crystal unit cell comprises two entities.  Hydroxylapatite is the [[hydroxyl]] [[Endmember (mineralogy)|endmember]] of the complex [[apatite|apatite group]]. The OH<sup>-</sup> [[ion]] can be replaced by [[fluorine|fluoride]], [[chlorine|chloride]] or [[carbonate]], producing [[fluorapatite]] or [[chlorapatite]]. It crystallizes in the [[hexagonal (crystal system)|hexagonal]] [[crystal system]]. Pure hydroxylapatite powder is white. Naturally occurring apatites can, however, also have brown, yellow, or green colorations, comparable to the discolorations of [[dental fluorosis]].

Up to 50% of [[osseous tissue|bone]] by weight is a modified form of hydroxylapatite (known as [[bone mineral]]).<ref>

</ref> Carbonated calcium-deficient hydroxylapatite is the main mineral of which [[dental enamel]] and [[dentin]] are composed.  Hydroxylapatite crystals are also found in the small calcifications  (within the [[pineal gland]] and other structures) known as [[corpora arenacea]] or 'brain sand'.

==Medical uses==

Hydroxylapatite can be found in teeth and bones within the human body. Thus, it is commonly used as a filler to replace amputated bone or as a coating to promote bone ingrowth into [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] implants.  Although many other [[phase (matter)|phase]]s exist with similar or even identical chemical makeup, the body responds much differently to them. [[Coral]] skeletons can be transformed into hydroxylapatite by high temperatures; their porous structure allows relatively rapid ingrowth at the expense of initial mechanical strength.  The high temperature also burns away any organic molecules such as [[protein]]s, preventing an immune response and rejection.

Many modern implants, e.g. [[hip replacement]]s and [[dental implants]], are coated with hydroxylapatite. It has been suggested that this may promote<ref>{{cite web|last=Jeong|first=KI|title=Experimental Study of Osseointegration and Stability of Intentionally Exposed Hydroxyapatite Coating Implants|url=http://www.koreamed.org/SearchBasic.php?RID=0071JKAMPRS/2012.34.1.12&DT=1|work=Journal|publisher=Journal of the Korean Maxillofacial Reconstructive Surgery|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> [[osseointegration]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

As a component of nanocomposites, hydroxylapatite is finding uses as a potential new bone replacement materials.

==Chromatography==
The mechanism of hydroxylapatite (HA) [[chromatography]] is complicated and has been described as "mixed-mode" ion exchange.  It involves nonspecific interactions between  positively charged calcium ions and negatively charged phosphate ions on the stationary phase HA resin with protein negatively charged carboxyl groups and positively charged amino groups.  It may be difficult to predict the effectiveness of HA chromatography based on physical and chemical properties of the desired protein to be purified.  For elution, a buffer with increasing phosphate concentration is typically used.

==Use in archaeology==
In [[archaeology]], hydroxylapatite from [[faunal assemblage|human and animal remains]] is analysed in order to reconstruct ancient [[Diet (nutrition)|diets]]. The mineral fractions of bone and teeth act as a reservoir of [[Micronutrients|trace elements]], including [[strontium]]. It has been established that the ratio of strontium to calcium in bone hydroxylapatite broadly reflects an animal's diet during the period before its death when the bone was being formed (5–10 years in the case of human remains), or in the case of dental mineral in childhood. In either case analysis of Sr/Ca ratios allows an individual's diet to be classified as [[carnivore|carnivorous]], [[herbivore|herbivorous]] or [[omnivore|omnivorous]] and either predominantly marine or terrestrially based. However the difficulty of compensating for post-mortem contamination of archaeological samples through interaction with [[groundwater]] continues to cast doubt on the reliability of the method. [[Isotope analysis#Archaeology|Stable isotope analysis]] is considered a more viable alternative, although strontium and other trace mineral analyses of dental samples are commonly used in situations where this is impossible because the [[collagen]] content of the bone has completely decayed (i.e. for [[palaeolithic]] samples).<ref name="Archaeological Chemistry">{{cite book|last=Pollard|first=M.|last2=Heron|first2=C.|title=Archaeological Chemistry|year=2008|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-85404-262-3|doi=10.1039/9781847558299|pages=346–382|accessdate=4 October 2010|chapter=Chapter 10: The Chemistry of Human Bone: Diet, Nutrition, Status and Mobility}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Sadat-Shojai|first=Mehdi|title=Hydroxyapatite: Inorganic Nanoparticles of Bone (Properties, Applications, and Preparation Methodologies)|year=2010|publisher=Iranian Students Book Agency (ISBA)|location=Tehran, Iran|isbn=978-600-102-092-6|url=http://www.isba.ir/book/asp/book_detail.asp?BID=4962}}</ref>
