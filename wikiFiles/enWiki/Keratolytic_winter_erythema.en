The name "Oudtshoorn skin" derives from the town of [[Oudtshoorn]] in the [[Western Cape]] province of [[South Africa]], where the disorder was first described.<ref name=kwe77/><ref name=kwe94/> It is one of several [[genetic disorder]]s known to be highly prevalent among the [[Afrikaner]] population.<ref name=gen83>{{cite pmid|6414096}}</ref>

== Characteristics ==
KWE is characterized by a number of anomalies affecting the skin. Erythema causes redness of the skin, which is generally associated with [[inflammation]] and irritation.<ref>{{cite pmid|17722231}}</ref> Including erythema and [[hyperkeratosis]] (thickening of the [[stratum corneum]]),<ref name=kwead/><ref name=kwea97>{{cite pmid|9311742}}</ref> naturally occurring keratolytic peeling and [[desquamation|scaling]], with increased manifestation in winter, are prevailing features of the disorder.<ref name=kwe94/><ref name=face09/> 

Erythema in KWE has been attributed to [[necrobiosis]] (cellular death) within the [[malpighian layer]] (the innermost layer of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]).<ref name=strat78/> Peeling and scaling are caused by spreading [[dissection]] of the stratum corneum, correlating to the underlying necrobiosis.<ref name=strat78/>

The effects of KWE appear intermittently as patches on the skin of the palms and soles, with these patches appearing on the [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]], [[buttocks]] and [[torso]] in severe cases.<ref name=kwe77/><ref name=kwe94/><ref name=face09/> Facial [[lesion]]s of this type have also been reported with the disorder, though this is considered to be an extremely rare occurrence.<ref name=face09/>

Onset and cyclical recurrence of KWE have shown to be associated with the arrival of winter, or winter-like weather.<ref name=kwead/><ref name=kwe77/><ref name=omim>{{OMIM|148370}}</ref> Worsening of symptoms during this time may be considered as an indicator of recurrent onset in patients known to have the disorder, and age of initial onset can be from early childhood to young adulthood, with attenuation of symptoms sometimes happening after age 30.<ref name=strat78/><ref name=kwe77/> Patients first exhibiting the disorder at a younger age may also experience worsened symptoms.<ref name=kwead/> Currently, no specific correlating factor or reason for winter-related manifestation has been established, though the coldness and dryer air common to winter conditions may be suspect.<ref name=kwead/> Winter onset is, however, considered to be a distinguishing feature of KWE among other erythematic skin disorders.<ref name=kwe94/> 

When peeling of skin occurs, the newly exposed layer of skin underneath is moist, raw and very sensitive. While this may result in minor discomfort and inconvenience, in severe cases of KWE where large areas of raw skin are present, it is often life-altering and debilitating.<ref name=strat78/>

== Epidemiology ==
Oudtshoorn is a town in Western Cape (formerly [[Cape Province]]), South Africa, where KWE ("Oudtshoorn skin") was first described.<ref name=kwe77/> The disorder is quite prevalent among Afrikaners of South Africa, a population which can be defined as [[Caucasian race|caucasoid]] native-speakers of [[Afrikaans]], with northwestern [[Europe]]an [[kinship|lineage]].<ref name=kwead/><ref name=gen83/><ref name=kwea97/><ref name=omim/> Among this group, KWE occurs at a rate of approximately 1/7,200.<ref name=kwead/> 

This relatively high rate of occurrence has been attributed to the [[founder effect]], in which a small, often [[consanguinity|consanguinous]] population is formed out of the larger [[ancestor|ancestral]] population, resulting in a loss of [[genetic diversity]].<ref name=kwea97/> In the context of KWE, the founder effect was confirmed by [[haplotype]] analysis, which indicates that the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] origin of a possible [[gene]]tic [[mutation]] responsible for the disorder is particularly common among affected Afrikaners.<ref name=kwead/><ref name=kwea97/> This is also true in other South Africans of European descent with KWE, and the chromosome of interest in both these and Afrikaner patients strongly points to an unspecified ancestor or ancestral group that may have settled around the Oudtshoorn area.<ref name=kwead/><ref name=kwe77/><ref name=kwea97/>

A second lineage known to exhibit KWE has been reported in [[Germany]], although there it is less prevalent and appears to involve the chromosome from a different ancestral origin than that seen in Afrikaners.<ref name=kwea97/> KWE has also been noted in other countries around the northwestern region of Europe, such as [[Denmark]].<ref name=kweden/>

== Pathophysiology ==

KWE is of unknown etiology (unknown cause), as at the present time, no specific mutation of any gene has been established as the cause of the disorder.<ref name=kwead/> Research has shown, however, that the gene involved is located on human [[chromosome 8 (human)|chromosome 8]].<ref name=kwead/><ref name=kwea97/>

A [[candidate gene]] is a gene that is suspected to cause a disease or disorder. In KWE, this gene is known to be located in the area between chromosome 8q22 and 8q23.<ref name=kwead/><ref name=kwea97/> Within this region, the occurrence of [[loss of heterozygosity]] (simultaneous loss of function in both [[allele]]s of a gene) has been associated with [[cancer|malignancy]], including certain types of [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[lung cancer]].<ref>{{cite pmid|10807692}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|10213509}}</ref> During the investigation for a KWE candidate gene in this same region, twelve [[protein]] [[transcription (genetics)|transcripts]] were evaluated between [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] markers D8S550 and D8S1759, which is a critical area shown to be the source of KWE pathogenesis.<ref name=kwead/> Among the twelve transcripts identified, one corresponded to the ''[[BLK (gene)|BLK]]'' gene, which encodes the [[enzyme]] ''B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase''.<ref name=kwead/> Four other of these transcripts included a [[myotubularin]] (''[[MTMR8]]''), a potential human [[homology (biology)|homologue]] of the [[mouse]] ''[[CCL18|Amac1]]'' enzyme, a transcript similar to the mouse ''[[L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase]]'' gene, and one similar to a human [[oncogene]].<ref name=kwead/> The remaining seven transcripts did not resemble any currently known genes.<ref name=kwead/> In all, none of the twelve transcripts displayed any evidence of pathogenic involvement with KWE.<ref name=kwead/> As a transcriptional map of this critical area is being drawn, based on microsatellite identification, haplotype analysis and other measures; localization of the gene associated with KWE pathogenesis is an ongoing process.<ref name=kwead/>

== Genetics ==

[[Image:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|Keratolytic Winter erythema has an autosomal dominant pattern of [[heredity|inheritance]].]] 

KWE is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.<ref name=kwead/> This means that the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an [[autosome]] (chromosome 8 is an autosome), and one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who also has the disorder. 

KWE can begin as a spontaneous mutation, first appearing in an individual with no previous family history of the disorder.<ref name=kweden/> This may be due to a genetic predisposition for the disorder, possibly connected to the Oudtshoorn ancestral line.<ref name=kweden/>
