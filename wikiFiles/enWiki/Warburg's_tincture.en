'''Warburg's tincture''' was a [[pharmaceutical]] drug, now obsolete. It was invented in 1834 by Dr [[Carl Warburg]].

Warburg's [[tincture]] was well known in the [[Victorian era]] as a medicine for [[fevers]], especially tropical fevers, including malaria. It was considered, by some, to be superior to [[quinine]].

Warburg's Tincture was a secret, proprietary remedy. The formula was not published until 1875. Later, it was included in the first edition of ''[[Martindale: The Extra Pharmacopoeia]]''. Warburg's Tincture included an array of ingredients, including quinine.<ref>[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Wa/Warburg%2527s+tincture.html ''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'', 1913]</ref><ref name=warburg1870>Warburg, Carl (1870, London), ''Warburg Tincture: Statement proving by numerous official documents its remarkable curative powers in fevers...''</ref><ref name=Lancet1875>''The Lancet'', edition 1875-11-13, 'Professor Maclean, C.B., on the true composition and therapeutic value of Warburg's Tincture', pp. 716–718.</ref>

== Appearance and format==

As its name implies, Warburg's Tincture was originally available only in liquid form. It was deep brown to golden yellow in colour; its taste was bitter and not very palatable. It was sold in small bottles of unique design, containing about one ounce.<ref name=Lancet1875/> The label affixed to each bottle bore the registered trademark, which depicted an image of the bottle accompanied by a facsimile of Carl Warburg's signature.<ref>archives of joint stock companies, National Archives, Kew.</ref> By 1888 the drug was available in tablet form.<ref name="ReferenceA">''The British Medical Journal'', edition 1888-12-01, p. 1232</ref>

== History ==

Warburg's Tincture was invented by Dr Carl Warburg MD in 1834, in [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]). It was introduced into Europe in 1839.<ref name="Warburg, Carl 1839"/><ref name=medico-chirurgical,1839>''The medico-chirurgical review and journal of medical science'', Volume 34, p. 658, 1839</ref> Warburg's Tincture received medical trials in British Guiana in the 1830s, and then elsewhere around the world in the 1840s and 1850s. In 1846, Warburg's Tincture was extensively trialled in Austria and, the following year, it was adopted as an official medicine by the [[Austrian Empire]], by imperial order.<ref name=MedicalTimes1851>''Medical Times'', edition, 1851-1-4, pp. 700–702, letter from Carl Warburg</ref>

Warburg's Tincture was sold as a secret, proprietary medicine for over forty years, and was marketed and manufactured by Carl Warburg for many decades. He wanted the British Government to procure the formula of Warburg's Tincture from him, but such an arrangement never came to fruition. Nevertheless, the British Government was a significant client, procuring Warburg's Tincture for military forces serving overseas in [[India]] and [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]); in Africa, in [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]), [[Gambia]] and [[Sierra Leone]]; in the [[West Indies]]; and in  [[Cyprus]], [[Corfu]], [[Mauritius]] and [[China]].<ref name=warburg1870/><ref name=Lancet1875/> In 1867, in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], [[Sir Robert Anstruther, 5th Baronet]] asked the Secretary of War why Warburg's Tincture was not being supplied in larger quantities to troops in India.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1867/may/28/question#S3V0187P0_18670528_HOC_10 Hansard, 1867-5-28]</ref>

Writing in 1870, Carl Warburg, lamented that his [[eponymous]] drug was "comparatively unknown".<ref name=warburg1870/> The formula was disclosed by him in November 1875 when it was published on his behalf in ''[[The Lancet]]'' and ''The Medical Times''.<ref name=Lancet1875/><ref>''Medical Times and Gazette'', November 1875</ref>  In 1855, it retailed at 6s/6d a bottle.<ref>official advertisement, 1855</ref>

== Medicinal uses ==

=== Medicinal claims ===

Warburg's Tincture was promoted by its inventor, Dr Carl Warburg, as a medicine suitable for treating all types of [[fevers]],  but especially tropical fevers, including [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]]; and that it could also be used as a [[Herbal tonic|tonic]] in debility and convalescence. He claimed that his [[eponymous]] tincture was superior to any other [[antipyretic]], including [[quinine]]. "I assert that for perfect safety, for efficacy, rapidity of action, and for economy, my tincture has no rival, nor any approach to it". He also stated that quinine only "relieves", whereas Warburg's Tincture "cures". He advocated that Warburg's Tincture could be employed at all stages of fever, as well as a [[prophylactic]].<ref name=warburg1870/>

{{quotation|" [Warburg’s Tincture] is an unfailing remedy in all cases of Intermittent, Continued, Continued-Remittment, Nervous and [[Typhus]] Fevers; [[Cholera]], [[Diarrhoea]], and [[Dysentery]]; [[Scrofula]] in all its forms; Incipient Consumption, Chronic Bronchitic Cough, Want of Appetite, Delirium Tremens, Morbid Digestion, arising from excess in the use of spirituous drinks, [[Scurvy]] and every disease of a scorbutic character. "
::'''Official advertisement, 1855'''<ref>Official advertisement for Warburg's Tincture, 1855</ref>}}

===19th century===

In the Victorian era Warburg's Tincture was principally employed in the treatment of tropical [[fevers]], including [[malaria]], [[yellow fever]] and [[typhus]]. It was therefore an [[antipyretic]], and an [[antimalarial drug]].<ref name=warburg1870/><ref name=Lancet1875/><ref>''The Medical Times – Pharmaceutical Number'', December 1844, pp. 182–184.</ref>

===20th century===

Warburg's Tincture was vaunted as being superior to quinine in the treatment of malaria by many in the Victorian era.  Quinine remained the first-line antimalarial drug of choice until the 1940s, when other drugs replaced it. Until recently [[Chloroquine]] was the most widely used antimalarial drug. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Warburg's Tincture was included in [[Burroughs Wellcome & Company]]'s tabloid medicine cases of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

"There is now no exact equivalent of Warburg's Tincture ....The most similar modern preparation is ammoniated tincture of quinine. This omits aloes and rhubarb, whose function was a laxative to 'purge' the patient's system, an approach to fever treatment now redundant. Ammoniated tincture of quinine last appeared in the [[British Pharmaceutical Codex]] of 1963, but still remains an official preparation that could be prepared if necessary....it was popular as an over the counter medicine for colds until c. 1980, but is now rarely used." <ref>correspondence from the Museum of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain to Roland Sparkes, December 1998.</ref>

== Reputation and efficacy==

'Warburg's Tincture' was a well-known drug in the Victorian era.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>''The Chemist and Druggist'', edition 1890-6-14, letter from Sir Sydney Holland</ref><ref>Dr Alexander Silver, minutes of meeting of Harveian Society, ''The British Medical Journal'', edition 1868-02-29, p. 206</ref> It earned itself a well regarded international reputation in certain quarters of the medical profession, many attesting to its efficacy and value.<ref name=warburg1870/><ref>Cantlie, James, ''Some Tropical Diseases and the Remedies required for their Treatment and Phrophylxis'', pp. 23–24, 1908, Royal  Society of Medicine [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2045782/?page=1]</ref><ref name=Practioner>Dr William Henry Broadbent, article, ''The Practioner'', edition February 1877, pp.196–202.</ref>

One of the most notable and strongest advocates of Warburg's Tincture was Surgeon-General [[W. C. Maclean]], C.B,  (1811–1898), Professor of Military Medicine at the Army Medical School, at Chatham and later at the [[Royal Victoria Military Hospital]], Netley, from 1860 until 1885.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/20256822 obituary, ''The British Medical Journal'', 1898]</ref><ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/20261407 ''The British Medical Journal'', 1899-07-29]</ref><ref>article by JSG Blair, ''Army Medical Corps'' journal, 2005, pp.49–50</ref> Maclean contributed the chapters on malarial fevers and dysentery in ''A System of Medicine'', edited by [[Sir John Russell Reynolds]] (the latter being "an eminent and highly influential physician in the Victorian era who held the Presidencies of the [[Royal College of Physicians of London]], and of the [[British Medical Association]]"<ref>M.J.

Maclean considered Warburg's Tincture to be the best drug for the treatment of malaria and, in his lectures and writings on tropical diseases, he strongly recommended its use.<ref name=Lancet1875/><ref>'Malarial Fevers' by  Dr W.

=== Detractors, secret remedy===

As a consequence of Warburg's Tincture being sold as a secret, proprietary remedy, many in the medical profession, particularly in England, derided, distrusted and dismissed it as a '[[patent medicine]]' or 'quack medicine', and disliked it and criticised Carl Warburg on grounds of [[professional ethics]].<ref name=warburg1870/><ref name=Lancet1875/>

== Status, entries in pharmacopoeia, formulary and other pharmaceutical compendia==
* Warburg's Tincture was adopted by the Austrian empire as an official medicine in 1847; it was added to the Austrian 'Materia Medica' under the name 'Tinctura Warburgi'.
* Warburg's Tincture appeared in the first edition of ''[[Martindale: The Extra Pharmacopoeia]]'' (now known as ''[[Martindale: The complete drug reference]]'') in 1883, and was included until the 19th edition of 1928.<ref>''Martindale: The Extra Pharmacopoeia'' – various editions</ref>
* Warburg's Tincture was included in the National Formulary Section of the ''The Dispensatory for the United States of America'' in the 20th edition in 1918, listed under the entry for 'Tinctura Antiperiodica'.<ref>''United States Dispensatory'' 20th Edition, pg. 1834, 1918, Jospeh P. Remington et al.</ref>
* ''The Pocket Formulary, and synopsis of the British & Foreign pharmacopoeias: comprising standard and approved formulae for the preparation and compounds employed in medical practice'' London, by Henry Beasley. Included in various editions, e.g. 1851 (fifth edition), 1856, 1877.
* ''Jahresbericht der Pharmazie'', 1910, Munich, Germany.
* Warburg's Tincture is now obsolete as a medicinal drug. It last appeared in the [[Martindale: The Extra Pharmacopoeia]] in 1928.

== Properties / formula ==

The formula of Warburg's Tincture was disclosed by its inventor in November 1875 when it was published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' and ''The Medical Times'' on his behalf - see below.

'''Ingredients and directions for preparation'''

{{quotation| Take: 4 ounces each of  Socotrine aloes, Rhubarb root (East India), Angelica seeds, and Confection Damocratric; 2 ounces each  of Helenis root (Elecampane root), Saffron, Fennel seeds, and Prepared chalk; and 1 ounce each of Gentian root, Zedoary root, Cubelis (tailed pepper), Myrrh, Camphor, and ''boletus laricis'' (Polyporus officinalis, a fungi). Above ingredients to be digested with 500 ounces of proof spirit in a water-bath for 12 hours; then expressed and ten ounces of Disulphate of Quinine added; the mixture to be replaced in the water-bath till all quinine is dissolved. The liquor, when cool, is to be filtered, and is then fit for use.<ref name=Lancet1875/> }}

Warburg's Tincture therefore contained quinine in addition to various purgatives, aromatics and carminatives.

The ingredient Confection Damocratric is a complex preparation which has not been obtainable for over a century; it comprised a vast quantity of different aromatic substances.

The prepared chalk was used to correct the otherwise extremely acrid taste of the tincture.

'''Dosage'''

A bottle of Warburg's Tincture contained about one ounce of liquid.  The drug was to be administered in two equal doses, a few hours apart.
