'''Sensory design''' aims to establish an overall diagnosis of the [[Sense|sensory perceptions]] of a product, and define appropriate means to [[design]] or redesign it on that basis. It involves an observation of the diverse and varying situations in which a given product or object is used in order to measure the users' overall opinion of the product, its positive and negative aspects in terms of [[Somatosensory system|tactility]], [[Visual perception|appearance]], [[Hearing (sense)|sound]] and so on.<ref name="Railway">{{cite web | last=Kingsley | first=Nick | title=Railway Gazette: Sensolab drives interior experimentation | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/sensolab-drives-interior-experimentation.html }}</ref>

Sensory assessment aims to quantify and describe, in a systematic manner, all human [[Perception#Types|perceptions]] when confronted with a product or an object using techniques initially developed for the [[food industry]]. Contrary to laboratory analysis, the perception of a product is carried out by a panel of  [[Psychological testing|trained testers]] comparing similar products.

The result allows researchers to establish a list of specifications and to set out a precise and quantified requirement. These are applied to [[material]]s and objects using various criteria:
* [[Somatosensory system|touch]], finish, colour, accessories and layout;
* [[sound]]s and [[:wikt:movement|movement]]s made when a product is handled;
* [[Olfaction|smell]];
* [[temperature]] and [[Heat equation|heat diffusion]];
* [[luminosity]].

In the [[transport]] sphere, these two branches of [[sensory analysis]] translate into sometimes minor enhancements to the design for a vehicle interior, information system, or station environment to smooth some of the rougher edges of the travel experience.<ref name="Railway"/>
