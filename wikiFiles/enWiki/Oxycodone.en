'''Oxycodone''' is an [[analgesic]] [[medication]] synthesized from [[Papaver bracteatum|poppy]]-derived [[thebaine]]. It was developed in 1916 in Germany,<ref>German (DE) Patent 296916</ref><ref name='Oxysynthesis'/> as one of several new [[semi-synthetic]] [[opioid]]s in an attempt to improve on the existing opioids: [[morphine]], [[diacetylmorphine]] (heroin), and [[codeine]].<ref name="Kalso">{{cite journal|author=Kalso E|title=Oxycodone|journal =Journal of Pain and Symptom Management|volume=29|issue =5S|pages=S47–S56|year=2005|doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2005.01.010|pmid=15907646}}</ref>

Oxycodone oral medications are generally prescribed for the relief of moderate to severe pain. Currently it is formulated as single ingredient products or compounded products. Some common examples of compounding are oxycodone with acetaminophen/paracetamol or [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s such as [[ibuprofen]]. The formulations are available as generics but are also made under various brand names. '''OxyContin''' is [[Purdue Pharma]]'s brand for [[Time release technology|time-release]] oral oxycodone. The manufacturing rights to time-released generic oxycodone are under dispute.

==Medical uses==
Oxycodone is effective for managing moderate to moderately severe acute or chronic [[pain]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Oxycodone|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/oxycodone.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> It has been found to improve [[quality of life]] for those with many types of pain.<ref name="Riley2008">{{cite journal|author=Riley J, Eisenberg E, Müller-Schwefe G, Drewes AM, Arendt-Nielsen L|title=Oxycodone: a review of its use in the management of pain|journal=Curr Med Res Opin|volume=24|issue=1|pages=175–192|year=2008 |doi=10.1185/030079908X253708|pmid=18039433}}</ref>

Oxycodone can also be used as an alternative to other [[opiates]] to treat severe [[diarrhea]] and diarrhea predominant [[irritable bowel syndrome]] when drugs such as [[loperamide]] and [[diphenoxylate]] are ineffective.   

In 2001, the European Association for [[Palliative Care]] recommended that oral oxycodone could be taken as a second-line alternative to oral [[morphine]] for [[cancer pain]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Morphine and alternative opioids in cancer pain: the EAPC recommendations: Expert Working Group of the Research Network of the European Association for Palliative Care |journal=Br J Cancer|volume=84 |issue=5|pages=587–593 |year=2001|doi=10.1054/bjoc.2001.1680 |pmid=11237376 |last1=Hanks |first1=GW |last2=Conno |first2=F |last3=Cherny |first3=N |last4=Hanna |first4=M |last5=Kalso |first5=E |last6=Mcquay|first6=HJ |last7=Mercadante |first7=S |last8=Meynadier |first8=J |last9=Poulain |first9=P |pmc=2363790}}</ref> There is no evidence that any opioids are superior to morphine in relieving the pain of cancer, and no controlled trials have shown oxycodone to be superior to morphine.<ref name="calman">{{cite book| editor =Calman K., Doyle D and Hanks G| title =Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine| publisher =[[Oxford University Press]]| year =1999| location =[[Oxford]]| isbn =0-19-262566-7}}</ref> However, compared to morphine, oxycodone causes less [[Hypoventilation|respiratory depression]], [[sedation]], [[pruritus]], and [[nausea]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As a result, it is generally better tolerated than morphine.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Adverse effects==
[[File:Side effects of Oxycodone.png|thumb|right|Main [[adverse effect|side effects]] of oxycodone<ref>{{cite web|author=American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|title=Oxycodone|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, MedlinePlus|date=2009-03-23|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682132.html|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref>]]
The most commonly reported effects include disturbing [[nightmares]], [[memory loss]], [[constipation]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[dizziness]], [[nausea]], [[lightheadedness]], [[headache]], dry mouth, [[anxiety]], itching, and heavy sweating.<ref>[http://www.info-drug-rehab.com/oxycodone.html Oxycodone Side Effects].</ref> It has also been claimed to cause dimness in vision due to [[miosis]] (pupil constriction), [[circulatory collapse]]. Some patients have also experienced loss of appetite, nervousness, [[abdominal pain]], [[diarrhea]], urine retention, [[dyspnea]], and [[hiccups]],<ref name="OxyContinInsertUS" /> although these symptoms appear in less than 5% of patients taking oxycodone. Rarely, the drug can cause [[impotence]], enlarged [[prostate gland]], and decreased [[testosterone]] secretion. 

In high doses, overdoses, or in patients not tolerant to opiates, oxycodone can cause shallow breathing, [[bradycardia]], cold, clammy skin, [[apnea]], [[hypotension]], miosis, [[circulatory collapse]], [[respiratory arrest]], and death.<ref name="OxyContinInsertUS" />

===Withdrawal===
The risk of experiencing severe [[withdrawal]] symptoms is high if a patient discontinues oxycodone abruptly. Therefore, use should be discontinued gradually rather than abruptly. People who use oxycodone in a hazardous or harmful fashion are at even higher risk of severe withdrawal symptoms, as they tend to use higher-than-prescribed doses. The symptoms of oxycodone withdrawal are the same as for other opiate-based painkillers, and may include "[[anxiety]], [[panic attack]], [[nausea]], [[insomnia]], [[muscle pain]], [[muscle weakness]], [[fever]]s, and other [[Flu-like syndrome|flu-like symptoms]]".<ref name="CESAR2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/oxycodone.asp|title=Oxycodone|accessdate=2009-03-25|date=2005-05-02|publisher=Center for Substance Abuse Research}}</ref>

Withdrawal symptoms have also been reported in newborns whose mothers had been either injecting or orally taking oxycodone during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12032797|year=2002|month=June|author=Rao R, Desai NS|title=OxyContin and neonatal abstinence syndrome|volume=22|issue=4|pages=324–5|doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7210744 |url=http://www.nature.com/jp/journal/v22/n4/pdf/7210744a.pdf|format=PDF|journal=J Perinatol|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>

===Detection in biological fluids===
Oxycodone and/or its major metabolites may be measured in blood or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with oxycodone and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish oxycodone from other opiates.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 9th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2011, pp. 1259–1262.</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
In 1997, a group of Australian researchers have proposed (based on a study in rats) that oxycodone acts on [[kappa Opioid receptor|κ-opioid receptors]], unlike morphine, which acts upon [[mu Opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptors]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ross FB, Smith MT|title=The intrinsic antinociceptive effects of oxycodone appear to be κ-opioid receptor mediated|journal=Pain|volume=73|issue=2|pages=151–157|year=1997 | pmid=9415500|doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(97)00093-6}}</ref> Further research by this group indicated the drug appears to be a κ<sub>2b</sub>-opioid agonist.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith MT|title=Differences between and combinations of opioids re-visited|journal=Curr Opin Anaesthesiol|volume=21|issue=5|pages=596–601|year=2008 |doi=10.1097/ACO.0b013e32830a4c4a|pmid=18784485}}</ref> However, this conclusion has been disputed, primarily on the basis that oxycodone produces effects that are typical of μ-opioid agonists, mainly because oxycodone is metabolized in the liver to oxymorphone as a metabolite, which is a more potent opioid agonist with stronger/higher binding affinity to μ-opioid receptors compared to oxycodone.<ref name="pmid17961923">{{cite journal |author=Kalso E |title=How different is oxycodone from morphine? |journal=Pain |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=227–228 |year=2007 |pmid=17961923 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2007.09.027 }}</ref>

In 2006, research by a Japanese group suggested the effect of oxycodone is mediated by different receptors in different situations. Specifically in diabetic mice, the κ-opioid receptor appears to be involved in the antinociceptive effects of oxycodone,<ref name="pmid16533506">{{cite journal |author=Nozaki C, Saitoh A, Kamei J |title=Characterization of the antinociceptive effects of oxycodone in diabetic mice |journal=Eur.

===Absorption===
After a dose of conventional oral oxycodone, peak plasma levels of the drug are attained in about one hour;<ref name="Lalovic2006">{{cite journal|author=Lalovic B, Kharasch E, Hoffer C, Risler L, Liu-Chen LY, Shen DD|title=Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral oxycodone in healthy human subjects: role of circulating active metabolites|journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther|volume=79|issue=5|pages=461–479|year=2006 | url=http://paincenter.wustl.edu/c/BasicResearch/documents/KharashClinPharm06.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=16678548|accessdate=2009-03-28|doi=10.1016/j.clpt.2006.01.009}}</ref> in contrast, after a dose of OxyContin (an oral controlled-release formulation), peak plasma levels of oxycodone occur in about three hours.<ref name="OxyContinInsertUS">{{cite book|title=1.

===Distribution===
Oxycodone in the blood is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain.<ref name="OxyContinInsertUS" /> Conventional oral preparations start to reduce pain within 10–15 minutes; in contrast, OxyContin starts to reduce pain within one hour.<ref name="AHFS" />

===Metabolism===
Oxycodone is metabolized to α and β oxycodol; [[oxymorphone]], then α and β oxymorphol and noroxymorphone; and noroxycodone, then α and β noroxycodol and noroxymorphone (N-desmethyloxycodone).<ref name="Lalovic2006" /> ([[14-Hydroxydihydrocodeine]] that in turn becomes [[Hydromorphinol|14-Hydroxydihydromorphine]]) These metabolites are true only for humans.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Tentative identification of novel oxycodone metabolites in human urine|pmid=14516487|year=2003|last1=Moore|first1=KA|last2=Ramcharitar|first2=V|last3=Levine|first3=B|last4=Fowler|first4=D|volume=27|issue=6|pages=346–52|journal=Journal of analytical toxicology}}</ref> As many as six metabolites for oxycodone (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone, [[14-hydroxydihydrocodeine]], 14-hydroxydihydrocodeinone N-oxide {oxycodone N-oxide}, 14-hydroxydihydroisocodeine, 14-hydroxydihydrocodeine N-oxide, and noroxycodone) have been found in rabbits,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/7/3/162 |title=Isolation and identification of urinary metabolites of oxycodone in rabbits|author= T Ishida, K Oguri and H Yoshimura|year=1979 |volume= 7|issue=3|pages=162–165|journal=Drug Metab.

Oxycodone is metabolized by the [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme system in the liver, making it vulnerable to drug interactions.<ref name="OxyContinInsertUS" /> Some people are fast metabolizers, resulting in reduced analgesic effect, but increased adverse effects, while others are slow metabolisers, resulting in increased toxicity without improved analgesia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gasche Y |title=Codeine intoxication associated with ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolism |journal=N Engl J Med|volume=351 |issue=27 |pages=2827–31 |year=2004 |pmid=15625333 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa041888|author2=Daali Y |author3=Fathi M |last4=Chiappe |first4=Alberto |last5=Cottini |first5=Silvia |last6=Dayer |first6=Pierre |last7=Desmeules |first7=Jules }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/clpt.1993.43 |author=Otton SV, Wu D, Joffe RT, Cheung SW, Sellers EM |title=Inhibition by fluoxetine of cytochrome P450 2D6 activity |journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther|volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=401–9 |year=1993 |pmid=8477556 }}</ref> The dose of OxyContin must be reduced in patients with reduced hepatic function.<ref name="AHFS" />

===Elimination===
Oxycodone and its metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine and sweat; therefore, it accumulates in patients with [[renal]] impairment.<ref name="AHFS" />

===Dosage and administration===
Oxycodone can be administered orally, intranasally, via [[intravenous]], [[intramuscular]], or [[subcutaneous]] injection, or [[suppository|rectally]]. The [[bioavailability]] of oral administration of oxycodone averages 60–87%, with rectal administration yielding the same results; intranasal varies between individuals with a mean of 46%.<ref>Analgesic Expert Group. Therapeutic Guidelines: Analgesic. Version 4. Melbourne: Therapeutic Guidelines Ltd, 2007.</ref>

Oxycodone is approximately 1.5–2.0 times as potent as morphine when administered orally.<ref>[http://www.pharma.com/PI/Prescription/Oxycontin.pdf (Oxycodone Hcl Controlled-Release) Tablets]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-05-10.</ref><ref>[http://www.mywhatever.com/cifwriter/library/70/4926.html Palliative Care Perspectives. James L.

No comparative trials show oxycodone is more effective than any other opioid. In [[palliative care]], morphine remains the gold standard;<ref name="calman" /> however, oxycodone can be useful as an alternative opioid if a patient has troublesome adverse effects with morphine.

==Chemistry==
Oxycodone's chemical name is derived from [[codeine]]. The chemical structures are very similar, differing only in that
* Oxycodone has a [[hydroxyl]] group at carbon-14 (codeine has just a hydrogen in its place), hence '''oxy'''codone;
* Oxycodone has a 7,8-dihydro feature, whereas codeine has a [[double bond]] between those two carbons; and
* Oxycodone has a [[carbonyl]] group (as in [[ketones]]) in place of the hydroxyl group of codeine, hence the "-one" suffix.

It is also similar to [[hydrocodone]], differing only in that it has a hydroxyl group at carbon-14.<ref name="AHFS">{{cite web|title=AHFS Drug Information.

==History==
Freund and Speyer of the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] in Germany first synthesized oxycodone from thebaine in 1916,<ref name='Oxysynthesis'>{{cite book|author=Sneader W|title=Drug discovery: a history|publisher=Wiley|year=2005|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=119|isbn=0-471-89980-1}}</ref> a few years after the German pharmaceutical company [[Bayer]] had stopped the mass production of [[heroin]] due to hazardous use, harmful use, and dependence. It was hoped that a [[thebaine]]-derived drug would retain the analgesic effects of morphine and heroin with less dependence. To some extent this was achieved, as oxycodone does not have the same immediate effect as heroin or morphine, nor does it last as long.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The first clinical use of the drug was documented in 1917, the year after it was first developed.<ref name='Oxysynthesis'/><ref name="Sunshine">{{cite journal|last=Sunshine A, Olson NZ, Colon A, Rivera J, Kaiko RF, Fitzmartin RD, Reder RF, Goldenheim PD|title= Analgesic efficacy of controlled-release oxycodone in postoperative pain|journal=J Clin Pharmacol|volume=36|issue=7|pages=595–603|date=1 July 1996|url=http://jcp.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/36/7/595 |accessdate=2009-03-25|pmid=8844441|first1=A|last2=Olson|first2=NZ|last3=Colon|first3=A|last4=Rivera |first4=J |last5=Kaiko |first5=RF |last6=Fitzmartin |first6=RD |last7=Reder |first7=RF |last8=Goldenheim |first8=PD}}</ref> It was first introduced to the US market in May 1939. In early 1928, Merck introduced a combination product containing [[scopolamine]], oxycodone, and [[ephedrine]] under the German initials for the ingredients SEE, which was later renamed Scophedal (SCOpolamine ePHEDrine and eukodAL)—this combination is essentially an oxycodone analogue of the morphine-based Twilight Sleep with ephedrine added to reduce circulatory and respiratory effects.

The United States and Canada are consistently ranked among the top two or three in most type of opioid consumption per capita (for example, in 2006 Canada ranked second and the US ranked third in morphine consumption per capita; only Austria ranked higher, because in addition to being used to treat moderate to severe pain, morphine is also used to treat heroin or morphine dependence in Austria—a practice which is unheard of in North America) Oxycontin is now called OxyNeo now which is impossible to crush, chew, snort, smoke, and inject.<ref name="INCB2009"/><ref name=UNPainpolicy>{{cite web|title=Availability of Opioid Analgesics in the World and Asia, With a special focus on: Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand|url=http://www.painpolicy.wisc.edu/publicat/monograp/philippines08.pdf|work=University of Wisconsin Pain & Policy Studies Group/World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Policy and Communications in Cancer Care|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>

In 2001, Purdue Pharma permanently suspended distribution of 160-mg tablets in the US because of the "possibility of illicit use of tablets of such high strength".

===Lawsuits concerning generics===
Purdue has multiple patents for OxyContin, but has been involved in a series of ongoing legal battles on the validity of these patents. On June 7, 2005, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] upheld a decision from the previous year that some of Purdue’s patents for OxyContin could not be enforced.<ref>{{cite court|litigants = Purdue Pharma L.P. v.

Later in May 2007 Purdue Pharma and three of its top executives pled guilty in a Virginia federal court to charges that they misbranded OxyContin by representing it to have "less euphoric effect and less abuse potential" than it actually has, and by claiming that people taking the drug at low doses could stop taking it suddenly without symptoms of withdrawal.<ref name="OBrien2007">{{cite web|author=O'Brien J|title =Purdue pleads out, will pay $634 million in fines|work =LegalNewsline.com| date =2007-05-10| url =http://www.legalnewsline.com/news/194919-purdue-pleads-guilty-will-pay-634-million-in-fines| accessdate =2009-04-11}}</ref> The FDA had not approved these claims.<ref>{{cite news|author=Chasan E|title=Purdue Frederick pleads guilty in OxyContin case|date=2007-05-10|work=Reuters|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSWBT00695020070510|accessdate=2009-04-21}}</ref> The company and the executives were to pay $634 million in fines for felony and misdemeanor misbranding.<ref name="OBrien2007" />

==== Representations of OxyContin in media and academic publications ====
In Canada, arguments are in conflict regarding the representation of OxyContin in the media and academic publications. Across the country, national and local newspapers and television news broadcasts often highlight the potential side effects and outcomes of the drug.<ref name=j3>{{cite journal|pmid=22059195|author=Whelan, E., Asbridge, M., & Haydt, S. |year=2011|title=Representations of OxyContin in North American newspapers and medical journals|journal=Pain, Research & Management|volume=16|issue=4|pages= 252–258|pmc=3202377}}</ref> Media reports have also criticized Purdue Pharma, the company responsible for the oxycodone brand, for promoting the drug with the promise to provide individuals a prolonged relief from pain, with minimal side effects.<ref name=j1>{{cite journal|pmid=18799767|author=Van Zee, A. |year=2009|title=The promotion and marketing of OxyContin: Commercial triumph, public health tragedy|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume= 99|issue=2|pages=221–227|pmc=2622774|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.131714}}</ref> Although the addictive properties of OxyContin are no more than other opioids, the health risks are heightened through its aggressive marketing practices.<ref name=j1/><ref name=r1>Blackwell, T. [http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/11/12/the-selling-of-oxycontin/ The selling of OxyContin]. National Post. (2011–1112).</ref> Advertisements in professional publications and medical journals have been consistent, touting the drug “as a safer alternative to even Aspirin and Tylenol and good for anyone who needed pain relief for ‘several days’ or more.”<ref name=r1/><ref name=r2>Comer, B. (2011, January). [http://www.mmm-online.com/issue/january/01/2011/1955/ MM&M Small Marketing Team of the Year: OxyContin]. Medical Media & Marketing.</ref> Advertisements in Monthly Prescribing Reference reiterate these claims by emphasizing OxyContin’s flexibility in regards to its dosage strength.<ref name=r2/> In addition to the zealous advertisements, the National Post revealed in 2011 that the company promoted the brand through “a textbook, website and presentations by paid experts that encouraged more liberal prescribing of opioids, based on debatable evidence.” <ref name=j1/><ref name=r1/>

Despite these criticisms, though, Health Canada and the Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board (a nongovernmental organization) claim they have not received any complaints or concerns regarding Purdue’s promotions for OxyContin.<ref name=r1/> In addition, the Canadian Pain Society has accused media representations of OxyContin as being misleading and one-sided. The organization points out the coverage often ignores the vast group of individuals who use the drug responsibly and benefit from its effects, focusing instead on a small group of individuals who use the drug recklessly.<ref name=r3>Canadian Pain Society. (2004, August 19). [http://www.canadianpainsociety.ca/news/PressReleaseCPSAugust202004.pdf Media coverage of OxyContin is one-sided: A statement from the Canadian Pain Society]</ref>

This notion is echoed in the research paper entitled "Representations of OxyContin in North American Newspapers and Journals". In the paper, Whelan et al. (2011) state, since the branding of OxyContin as ‘hillbilly heroin’ and a street drug, the drug has consistently been depicted as a social problem across Atlantic Canada, and other impoverished, rural areas in North America. Referring to 27 North American newspapers (six Canadian) and 33 medical journals (with a focus on addiction, substance abuse, pain, and general medicine), the objective of the research was to examine and compare the coverage of OxyContin and show how each medium contributes to the social problems related to the opioid. Using statistical analysis, the results revealed the newspaper reports highlighted the controversies associated with the drug, concentrating on stories regarding the abuse, crimes, and death rather than its beneficial uses for treating pain. In addition, Whelan et al. (2011) discovered inconsistencies in the physicians' reports in newspaper and medical journals, particularly those in fields of pain medicine and addiction medicine. Through this, the authors concluded the “prevalence of negative representations of OxyContin is often blamed on biased media coverage and an ignorant public. However, the proliferation of inconsistent messages regarding the drugs from physicians plays a role in the drug’s persistent status as a social problem.”<ref name=j3/>

=== General ===
In the US, oxycodone was initially produced by Endo Pharmaceuticals in 1950 as the prescription drug Percodan, a formulation of 5&nbsp;mg oxycodone and 325&nbsp;mg aspirin. Percodan, and later formulations of oxycodone which also included non-narcotic painkillers, were problematic drugs of abuse, but the dosage of oxycodone one could use was limited by the other ingredients in the pill, which also primarily restricted the routes of administration to oral ingestion. In 1995, however, oxycodone abuse skyrocketed after the FDA approval of OxyContin by Purdue Pharma. OxyContin is a formulation of nearly pure oxycodone available in up to 80&nbsp;mg in one pill, developed to provide 12 hours of time-released pain relief. Like other opioid narcotics, oxycodone carries substantial abuse potential and can produce feelings of [[euphoria]], similar in character to that caused by [[heroin]] and opioids in general. Users quickly learned they could crush the pill to defeat the time mechanism, releasing the desired active ingredient, oxycodone, which allowed abuse via larger doses and by additional routes of administrations, such as intravenous, rectal, and intranasal.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} However, the ability to defeat the time mechanism easily and reliably via physical manipulation of the tablets (crushing) ended its nearly 15-year-long run since 1995, when Purdue changed the time-release mechanism with the intention of making the tablets less easy to tamper with, many years ago.

In 2011, Purdue Pharma reformulated their OxyContin product line to use an abuse-resistant polymer designed to decrease the recreational value, abuse potential, and accidental overdose rates related to OxyContin, since the time release cannot be safely defeated via simple tampering. Unfortunately, OxyContin abuse remains as rampant as ever, because many addicts continue to inject the "abuse resistant" OP-imprinted OxyContin, having to resort to more dangerous and clandestine methods to attempt to improvise the injection of the plastic polymer coating the oxycodone in the tablets. The reformulated OxyContin tablets from Purdue Pharma now are imprinted with "OP" instead of the original "OC". Since then, Roxane Laboratories and others (most notably Xanodyne, makers of Roxicodone) released 15-mg and 30-mg instant-release oxycodone formulations, and these have become the notoriously popular oxycodone formulations of choice by abusers. These pills are known by their street names: Roxis, Blues, IR OC and "30s" (in reference to the strongest commercial 30-mg oxycodone IR tablet). Many generic forms of oxycodone hydrochloride are available, notably the 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 30-mg instant-release oxycodone formulations. Abusers ingest, [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflate]] (snort), attempt to smoke, or intravenously inject the drug.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} However, due to its high bioavailability (60-87% orally or rectally) and minimal presystemic, first pass metabolism, many abusers take the drug orally, since the mere 13% gain in bioavailability one might hope to achieve by injecting the drug instead can be logically negated by simply weighing risk:reward ratio. With intravenous (IV) oxycodone, the risks far outweigh any potential reward over the oral route of administration, and contrary to what the media portray, this "hillbilly heroin" does not need to be injected for significant bioavailability gain. This is not the case with heroin, which has a low oral bioavailability. With heroin (and morphine, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone), the low bioavailability drives addicts to inject, which can double, triple, or even quadruple the bioavailability (the amount of drug that reaches the bloodstream, IV use bypasses the liver and presystemic elimination), but this is not the case with oxycodone. Users injecting oxycodone receive, at most, 13% higher levels of oxycodone in their bloodstreams compared to their orally dosed counterparts, which makes injection of the drug unsafe and unwise. It is wise to be careful not to mix oxycodone with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, sedatives, or tranquilizers such as benzodiazepines (alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, zolpidem, etc.) due to the very real risk of fatal respiratory depression.

Deaths from opioid pain relievers increased from 13.7 deaths per million residents in 1991 to 27.2 deaths per million residents in 2004, which may be related to the spread of OxyContin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20091207/opioids_091207/20091207?hub=TopStoriesV2|title=Study finds huge rise in oxycodone deaths|accessdate=2009-12-07|publisher=[[CTV News]]}}</ref> After the United States, Canada was the world's largest per capita consumer of oxycodone in 2006, 2007, and 2008.

Hazardous use, harmful use, and diversion of OxyContin in the UK commenced in the early- to mid-2000s.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gordon T|title=Scots' use of 'hillbilly heroin' rises by 430%|work=Sunday Times (London)|date=2008-03-30}}</ref> The first known death due to OxyContin overdose in the UK occurred in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|author=Thompson T|title=Epidemic fear as 'hillbilly heroin' hits the streets

=== United States ===
In 2001, the [[Cato Institute]] conducted a study with the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) on oxycodone-related deaths. Unfortunately, the results were inconclusive, as 58 medications at that time contained oxycodone.<ref>http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa545.pdf</ref>

A 2003 study by the [[Government Accountability Office]] found three factors may have contributed to the illicit use and distribution of OxyContin in the US:<ref name="GAO2003" />
* OxyContin contains a large amount of oxycodone compared with other types of oxycodone-containing pills.
* OxyContin's warning label said to not crush the controlled-release tablets because of the potential for rapid release of oxycodone, which led to many people crushing the tablets and injecting or snorting the drug.
* By 2001, sales of OxyContin in the US exceeded $1 billion per year.

A study published in 2005 examined the prevalence of opiate analgesic use among "recreational drug users and street addicts" as perceived by "key informants" throughout the US; the authors found the nonclinical use of opiates was increasing in general, but that of the drugs studied use of OxyContin "was mentioned most frequently".<ref name="trends">{{cite journal |author=Cicero TJ, Inciardi JA, Muñoz A |title=Trends in abuse of OxyContin and other opioid analgesics in the United States: 2002–2004 |journal=J Pain|volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=662–72 |year=2005 |pmid=16202959 |doi=10.1016/j.jpain.2005.05.004 |url=http://paincenter.wustl.edu/c/BasicResearch/documents/CiceroJPain2005.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> Purdue Pharma has attempted to reformulate the 10– to 40-mg strengths of OxyContin to prevent the release of a high percentage of the oxycodone by crushing; however, a 2008 joint panel convened by the US Food and Drug Administration was "concerned that abusers could find a way to manipulate the new formulation".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith L|title=Panel slams OxyContin trials and says abuse, mortality risks persist|journal=Family Practice News|volume=38|issue=11|page=5|date=2008-06-01|doi=10.1016/S0300-7073(08)70694-7}}</ref>
In 2010, Purdue Pharma introduced OxyContin OP, predicting the abuse of higher-dose formulations such as OxyContin will go down, but this change may cause heavy recreational users to resort to other drugs, such as heroin, or may increase the number of deaths caused by acetaminophen poisoning from users attempting to take similar doses of drugs such as Percocet or Vicodin to get similar effects. Since OxyContin OP has now fully saturated the street markets, recreational users find it nearly impossible to find the original OxyContin formulations.

One investigation in Boston found OxyContin was a "gateway" drug for [[heroin]], to which addicts turned as a cheaper alternative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/2010/04/12/east-boston-oxycontin |title=OxyContin A Gateway For Young Users In Eastie |publisher=WBUR |accessdate=2010-08-01}}</ref>

==Legal status==

===General===
Oxycodone is subject to international conventions on narcotic drugs. In addition, oxycodone is subject to national laws that differ by country. The 1931 [[Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs]] of the [[League of Nations]] included oxycodone.<ref>{{cite web|author=League of Nations|title=Convention for limiting the manufacture and regulating the distribution of narcotic drugs|year=1931|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1931/07/19310713%2006-44%20AM/Ch_VI_8_ap.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> The 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] of the [[United Nations]], which replaced the 1931 convention, categorized oxycodone in Schedule I.<ref name="SingleConvention">{{cite web|title=United Nations conference for the adoption of a single convention on narcotic drugs.

=== Australia ===
Oxycodone is in Schedule I (derived from the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs) of the Commonwealth's Narcotic Drugs Act 1967.<ref>{{cite web|author=Commonwealth of Australia|title=Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 – first schedule|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nda1967160/sch1.html|accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref> In addition, it is in Schedule 8 of the Australian Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons ("Poisons Standard"), meaning it is a "controlled drug... which should be available for use but require[s] restriction of manufacture, supply, distribution, possession and use to reduce abuse, misuse and physical or psychological dependence".<ref>{{cite book|author=Australian Government. Department of Health and Aging. Therapeutic Goods Administration|title=Standard for the uniform scheduling of drugs and poisons no. 23 |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrument1.nsf/0/3BBB39C4645284BCCA2574A6001C711F/$file/PoisonsStandard2008.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |location=Canberra|isbn=1-74186-596-4|year=2008 | month=June|accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref>

=== Canada ===
Oxycodone is a controlled substance under Schedule I of the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] (CDSA).<ref name="CanadaCDSA">{{cite web|last=Canada Department of Justice|title=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (1996, c. 19)|date=2009-02-27|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/C-38.8///en|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref> Every person who seeks or obtains from a practitioner either the substance or an authorization to obtain the substance must disclose to that practitioner information on all controlled substances and authorizations for controlled substances obtained from any other practitioner within the preceding 30 days; otherwise, the person may be found "guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years".<ref name="CanadaCDSA" /> Anyone possessing the substance for the purpose of trafficking "is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life".<ref name="CanadaCDSA" />
While the drug remains a controlled substance, as of March 1, 2012, OxyContin has been removed from pharmacy shelves and replaced with OxyNEO, which producer Purdue Pharma declares is more difficult to abuse and misuse.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/03/08/oxycontin-marketing.html OxyContin marketing blamed for addiction epidemic"], CBC News (2012-03-08)</ref>

====Legislative changes regulating oxycondone in Canada====
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
In February 2012, Ontario passed legislation to allow the expansion of an already existing drug-tracking system for publicly funded drugs to include those that are privately insured. This database will function to identify and monitor patient’s attempts to seek prescriptions from multiple doctors or retrieve from multiple pharmacies. Other provinces have proposed similar legislation, while some, such as Nova Scotia, have legislation already in effect for monitoring prescription drug use. These changes have coincided with other changes in Ontario’s legislation to target the misuse of painkillers and high addiction rates to drugs such as oxycodone. As of February 29, 2012, Ontario passed legislation delisting oxycodone from the province’s public drug benefit program. This was a first for any province to delist a drug based on addictive properties. The new law prohibits prescriptions for OxyNeo except to certain patients under the Exceptional Access Program including palliative care and in other extenuating circumstances. Patients already prescribed oxycodone will receive coverage for an additional year for OxyNeo, and after that, it will be disallowed unless designated under the exceptional access program.<ref>Olgilvie, Megan. [http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1133247--ontario-to-delist-oxycontin-and-its-substitute-from-drug-benefit-program "Ontario delisting OxyContin and its substitute from drug benefit program"] Toronto Star (2012-02-17)</ref>

In addition to all the aforementioned, some pharmacies have discontinued selling the product due to all the controversies and robberies that have taken place. Many of these pharmacies that have stopped selling Oxycontin and OxyNeo have erected signs at the front of their stores stating: "We do not carry Oxycontin or OxyNeo" or " Oxycontin available by special order only". Certain criminals are actually attracted to these signs sometimes, as they tend to view it as a diversion into not robbing the pharmacy. Also, a piece of valid government identification is required by the physician writing the prescription, where he or she notes the ID numbers on the prescription itself. After the patient receives the prescription and is headed to fill it at a pharmacy, the same identification presented to the physician must then be provided to the pharmacy prior to dispensing the medication.
Saskatchewan has recently joined Atlantic Canada in its efforts to curb abuse of OxyContin by also pulling public funding for the drug.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/02/22/oxycontin-canada-saskatchewan-ontario_n_1292895.html OxyContin Canada: Saskatchewan Joins Atlantic Provinces And Ontario In Pulling Funding]. Huffington Post. Canadian Press. (2012-02-22)</ref> 

Much of the legislative activity has stemmed from Purdue Pharma’s decision in 2011 to begin a modification of oxycodone’s composition to make it more difficult to crush for snorting or injecting. The new formulation, OxyNeo, is intended to be preventative in this regard and retain its effectiveness as a pain killer. Since introducing its ''Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act'', Ontario has committed to focusing on drug addiction, particularly in the monitoring and identification of problem opioid prescriptions, as well as the education of patients, doctors, and pharmacists.<ref>[http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/drugs/ons/ons_legislation.aspx Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act]. 2010. Ministry of Health and Long Term Care.</ref> This Act, introduced in 2010, commits to the establishment of a unified database to fulfill this intention.<ref>Irfan Dhalla, Irfan & Born, Karen. [http://healthydebate.ca/2011/02/_mailpress_mailing_list_healthydebate-news/opioids Health Debate]. (2012-02-22)</ref> Both the public and medical community have received the legislation positively, though concerns about the ramifications of legal changes have been expressed. Because laws are largely provincially regulated, many speculate a national strategy is needed to prevent smuggling across provincial borders from jurisdictions with looser restrictions.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/02/20/ontario-oxycontin-rules-national-regulations_n_1288375.html Ontario OxyContin Rules: New Restrictions Applauded But National Rules Needed].

====Lawsuits in Canada====
Several class action suits across Canada have been launched against the Purdue group of companies and affiliates. Claimants argue the pharmaceutical manufacturers did not meet a standard of care and were negligent in doing so. These lawsuits reference earlier judgments in the United States, which held that Purdue was liable for wrongful marketing practices and misbranding. Since 2007, the Purdue companies have paid over $650 million in settling litigation or facing criminal fines.<ref>Martin, Kevin.

Oxycodone is regulated under Part I of Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.<ref name="HKOrdinance">{{cite web|author=Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China|title=Dangerous drugs ordinance – chapter 134|publisher=Hong Kong Legal Information Institute|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/cur/134.txt|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> The penalty for trafficking (Section 4) or manufacturing (Section 6) the substance is a [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]5,000,000  fine and/or life imprisonment.<ref name="HKOrdinance" /> In Section 8 of the ordinance, possession of the substance for consumption without licence from the Department of Health is illegal and subject to a HL$1,000,000 fine and/or seven years of imprisonment.<ref name="HKOrdinance" /> Per Sections 22–23, only specific health professionals and others (e.g., "a person in charge of a laboratory used for the purposes of research") may possess and supply the substance.<ref name="HKOrdinance" /> Anyone who supplies the substance without a valid prescription can be fined HK$10,000 according to Section 31.<ref name="HKOrdinance" />

=== Singapore ===
Oxycodone is listed as a Class A drug in the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]] of [[Singapore]], which means offences in relation to the drug attract the most severe level of punishment. A conviction for unauthorized manufacture of the drug attracts a [[mandatory sentencing|minimum sentence]] of 10 years of imprisonment and [[caning in Singapore|corporal punishment]] of five strokes of the cane, and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment or 30 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.<ref>{{Singapore legislation|title=Misuse of Drugs Act|cap=185|ed=2008}} (Singapore), section 6(1).</ref> The minimum and maximum penalties for unauthorized trafficking in the drug are respectively five years of imprisonment and five strokes of the cane, and 20 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.<ref>Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore), section 5(1).</ref>

=== United States ===
Under the [[Controlled Substances Act]], oxycodone is a [[List of Schedule II drugs|Schedule II controlled substance]] because it "has a high potential for abuse", because it "has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions", and because use of the drug "may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence".<ref name="USCSA">{{cite web|title=(United States Code.)

As of April 2010, an "abuse-resistant", controlled-release formulation of OxyContin was approved for sale in the United States. The reformulated OxyContin is intended to lessen the ability to tamper with the opioid medication — from being cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved, but no evidence shows this reformulation of OxyContin is less subject to misuse, abuse, diversion, overdose, or addiction.<ref>[http://www.purduepharma.com/pdfs/DearHCPLetter.pdf Letter from Purdue Pharma L.P. to Healthcare Professional], October 4, 2010</ref> The abuse-resistant formulation is recognizable by a pill marking "OP" on one side and the milligrams of oxycodone contained within the pill on the other; the previous formulation has an "OC" marking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2010/04/oxycontin_fda.html |title="FDA Approves New Formulation of OxyContin Designed to reduce abuse of the prescription painkiller, though it has failed to stop the addiction epidemic.
