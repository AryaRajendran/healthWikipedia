In [[medicine]], a '''muscle biopsy''' is a procedure in which a piece of [[muscle]] [[Biological tissue|tissue]] is removed from an [[organism]] and examined [[Microscopy|microscopically]]. A [[needle aspiration biopsy|biopsy needle]] is usually inserted into a muscle, wherein a small amount of tissue remains. Alternatively, an "open biopsy" can be performed by obtaining the muscle tissue through a small surgical incision. A muscle biopsy can lead to the discovery of problems with a [[nervous system]], [[connective tissue]], [[vascular system]], or [[musculoskeletal system]]. In humans with weakness and low muscle tone, a muscle biopsy can help distinguish between [[myopathies]] (where the pathology is in the muscle tissue itself) and [[neuropathies]] (where the pathology is at the nerves innervating those muscles). Muscle biopsies can also help to distinguish among various types of [[myopathies]], by microscopic analysis for differing characteristics when exposed to a variety of chemical reactions and stains. 

However, in some cases the muscle biopsy alone is inadequate to distinguish between certain myopathies. For example, a muscle biopsy showing the nucleus pathologically located in the center of the muscle cell would indicate "[[Centronuclear myopathy (including myotubular myopathy)|centronuclear myopathy]]", but research has shown that a variety of [[myopathies]] can cause these centronuclear biopsy appearance, and hence the specific [[genetic testing]] becomes increasingly important.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pierson CR, Tomczak K, Agrawal P, Moghadaszadeh B, Beggs AH |title=X-linked myotubular and centronuclear myopathies |journal=J.

Additionally muscle biopsy is the only certain way to clarify ones muscle fiber types. I.e. by undergoing a muscle biopsy one can get a clear picture of which type of muscles dominates his/her body.
