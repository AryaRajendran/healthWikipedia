The '''lunate bone''' ('''semilunar bone''') is a [[carpal bone]] (wrist bone) in the [[human]] [[hand]] that may be distinguished by its deep concavity and crescentic outline. It is situated in the center of the proximal row of the [[carpus]] ([[wrist]]) region between the fore arm and hand (manus). In standard medical posture, the lunate carpal bone is situated between the lateral [[Scaphoid]] bone and medial [[Triquetral]] bone. The lunate carpal bone straddles distally the bordering ulna and radius bones and proximally to distal [[carpus]] (wrist) [[Trapezium bone]] and [[Trapezoid bone]]. 

The etymology of the Lunate bone derives from the Latin ''luna'' which means "moon", the lunate bone looks semi-similar to a crescent moon. In amphibians and reptiles, the bone is instead referred to as the ''intermedium'', because of its position between the other two proximal carpals. 

==Surfaces==
The '''superior surface''', convex and smooth, articulates with the [[radius (bone)|radius]]. 

The '''inferior surface''' is deeply concave, and of greater extent from before backward than transversely: it articulates with the head of the [[capitate]], and, by a long, narrow facet (separated by a ridge from the general surface), with the [[hamate]]. 

The '''dorsal''' and '''palmar surfaces''' are rough, for the attachment of ligaments, the former being the broader, and of a somewhat rounded form. 

The '''lateral surface''' presents a narrow, flattened, semilunar facet for articulation with the [[scaphoid]]. 

The '''medial surface''' is marked by a smooth, quadrilateral facet, for articulation with the [[triangular bone]].
