A 2010 systematic review by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] examined the results of 50 clinical trials comparing olanzapine to other second generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia. While high levels of attrition in the trials made interpretation problematic, treatment with olanzapine was tentatively concluded to provide superior improvement in mental state relative to [[aripiprazole]], [[quetiapine]] , [[risperidone]], and [[ziprasidone]], but not relative to [[amisulpride]] or [[clozapine]].  Fewer patients treated with olanzapine left the trial early due to lack of efficacy compared to quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone, and fewer patients in the olanzapine group had to be re-hospitalized relative to those treated with quetiapine, ziprasidone, but more than those treated with clozapine. Except for clozapine, all comparators induced less weight gain than olanzapine. Associated problems such as increased cholesterol and glucose were also more common in the olanzapine group. The authors concluded that "Olanzapine may be a somewhat more efficacious drug than some other second generation antipsychotic drugs. This small superiority in efficacy needs to be weighed against a larger weight gain and associated metabolic problems than most other second generation antipsychotic drugs, except clozapine. These conclusions are tentative due to the large number of people leaving the studies early which possibly limits the validity of the findings".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Komossa K, Rummel-Kluge C, Hunger H, ''et al.'' |title=Olanzapine versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD006654 |year=2010 |pmid=20238348 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006654.pub2 |url=}}</ref>

===Prevention of psychosis===
Olanzapine has been considered as part of an [[early intervention in psychosis|early psychosis]] approach for schizophrenia.  The Prevention through Risk Identification, Management, and Education (PRIME) study, funded by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and Eli Lilly, tested the hypothesis that olanzapine might prevent the onset of psychosis in people at very high risk for [[schizophrenia]]. The study examined 60 patients with [[Prodrome|prodromal]] schizophrenia, who were at an estimated risk of 36&ndash;54% of developing schizophrenia within a year, and treated half with olanzapine and half with [[placebo]].<ref>{{cite journal

===Use in elderly===
Citing an increased risk of [[stroke]], in 2004 the [[Committee on the Safety of Medicines]] (CSM) in the UK issued a warning that olanzapine and [[risperidone]], both atypical antipsychotic medications, should not be given to elderly patients with [[dementia]]. In the U.S., olanzapine comes with a [[black box warning]] for increased risk of death in elderly patients. It is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis.<ref>{{cite web

===Investigatory uses===
Olanzapine has been investigated for use as an [[antiemetic]], particularly for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ([[CINV]]).  A 2007 study demonstrated its successful potential for this use, achieving a complete response in the acute prevention of nausea and vomiting in 100% of patients treated with moderately and highly-emetogenic [[chemotherapy]], when used in combination with [[palonosetron]] and [[dexamethasone]].<ref>{{cite web

==Adverse effects==
{{accuracy-section|reason=some of the side effects named below are not listed on medical websites|date=April 2013}}
{{Original research|date=September 2009}}
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
As with all neuroleptic drugs, olanzapine can cause the (sometimes) irreversible movement disorder [[tardive dyskinesia]]. This is especially a concern with long term usage, and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia should be monitored carefully by the prescribing physician. Another concern is the rare, but life-threatening, [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]. 

Other recognised side effects may include:
*[[akathisia]]; inability to remain still (restlessness)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Makkos Z, Csonka A |title=[Akathisia in the course of olanzapine treatment] |language=Hungarian |journal=Neuropsychopharmacol Hung |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=215–7 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17211056 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

*[[apathy]], lack of emotion
*Endocrine side effects have included [[hyperprolactinemia]], [[hyperglycemia]], and [[diabetes mellitus]]
*[[SSRI discontinuation syndrome#Neurological|Brain zaps]] (may result from the blockade of serotonin receptors, since SSRI discontinuation can cause brain zaps and vertigo too)
*Auditory Hallucinations<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/sfx/olanzapine-side-effects.html Olanzapine Side Effects] - drugs.com</ref>

===Paradoxical effects===
While olanzapine is used therapeutically to treat serious mental illness, occasionally it can have the opposite effect and provoke serious [[paradoxical reaction]]s in a small subgroup of people, with the drug causing unusual changes in personality, thoughts or behavior; hallucinations, and suicidal ideation have also been linked to olanzapine use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/mtm/olanzapine.html |title=Olanzapine |author=Cerner Multum Incorporated |authorlink=Cerner |date=27 September 2011 |publisher=Drugs.com }}</ref>

===Metabolic effects===
The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] requires all atypical antipsychotics to include a warning about the risk of developing [[hyperglycemia]] and [[diabetes]], both of which are factors in the [[metabolic syndrome]]. These effects may be related to the drugs' ability to induce weight gain, although there are some reports of metabolic changes in the absence of weight gain,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramankutty|first=G|title=Olanzapine-induced destabilization of diabetes in the absence of weight gain|journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica|year=2002|volume=105|issue=3|pages=235–236|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0447.2002.2c257a.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0447.2002.2c257a.x/abstract}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=MT|coauthors=Copeland, Sampson, Duffy|title=New-onset type-2 diabetes associated with atypical antipsychotic medications|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry|year=2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=919–923|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.02.007|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6TBR-4JMKN26-1/2/1bec785c94339e91c2043f4670228f2c}}</ref>  Studies have indicated that olanzapine carries a greater risk of causing and exacerbating diabetes than another commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic, Risperidone.

===Pregnancy/Lactation===
Olanzapine in is the pregnancy category C. Pregnancy category C means: Drugs which, owing to their pharmacological effects, have caused or may be suspected of causing, harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate without causing malformations. Olanzapine can cross the placenta and is excreted in mothers' milk.<ref>Ambresin G, Berney P, Schulz P et al: Olanzapine excretion into breast milk: A case report. J Clin Psychopharmacol 2004; 24:93-95.</ref> Potential benefits to the mother may outweigh the risks to the foetus / infant, therefore as per the Prescribing Information from the packet insert: Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine.

===Animal toxicology===
In a placebo-compared study of six [[Macaque]] monkeys receiving doses of olanzapine resulting in drug levels comparable to those seen in subjects with schizophrenia treated with these medications for between 17 and 27 months, significant brain volume and weight decreases (8-11%) were detected.<!--

However, despite increasing demand for safe and effective antipsychotic withdrawal protocols or dose-reduction schedules, no specific guidelines with proven safety and efficacy are currently available. Support groups such as [http://theicarusproject.net/HarmReductionGuideComingOffPsychDrugs The Icarus Project], and other online forums provide resources and social support for those attempting to discontinue antipsychotics and other psychiatric medications.

The mode of action of olanzapine's antipsychotic activity is unknown. It may involve antagonism of [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]] receptors. Antagonism of dopamine receptors is associated with [[extrapyramidal effects]] such as [[tardive dyskinesia]], and with therapeutic effects. Antagonism of [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptors]] is associated with [[anticholinergic]] side effects such as dry mouth and constipation, in addition it may suppress or reduce the emergence of [[extrapyramidal effects]] for the duration of treatment, however it offers no protection against the development of [[tardive dyskinesia]]. Antagonizing H<sub>1</sub> histamine receptors causes sedation and may cause weight gain, although antagonistic actions at serotonin 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors have also been associated with weight gain and appetite stimulation.<ref>http://www.askdrjones.com/medication-best-meds/part-six-medication-and-weight-control/</ref>
Olanzapine may display an [[antiemetic]] effect due to its blockade of several receptors (specifically acetylcholine, dopamine, histamine, and serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub>) within the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]].

==Metabolism==
Olanzapine is metabolized by the [[cytochrome P450]] system isoenzymes 1A2 and 2D6 (minor pathway). Drug metabolism may be increased or decreased by agents that induce (e.g. cigarette smoke) or inhibit (e.g. [[fluvoxamine]] or [[ciprofloxacin]]) CYP1A2 activity, respectively.

==Controversy, lawsuits and settlements==

In 2002, British and Japanese regulatory agencies warned that Zyprexa may be linked to diabetes, but even after the FDA issued a similar warning in 2003, Lilly did not publicly disclose their own findings. Eli Lilly agreed on January 4, 2007 to pay up to $500 million to settle 18,000 lawsuits from people who claimed they developed diabetes or other diseases after taking Zyprexa.

Zyprexa was Lilly’s top-selling drug, with sales of $4.2 billion in 2011.

The documents, given to ''[[The New York Times]]'' by [[James Gottstein|Jim Gottstein]], show that Lilly executives kept important information from doctors about Zyprexa’s links to obesity and its tendency to raise blood sugar — both known risk factors for diabetes. ''[[The Times]]'' of London also reported that as early as October 1998, Lilly considered the risk of drug-induced obesity to be a "top threat" to Zyprexa sales.<ref name=timeso>[http://www.business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13129-2560841,00.html Eli Lilly was Concerned by Zyprexa Side-Effects from 1998], The Times (London), January 23, 2007</ref> On October 9, 2000, senior Lilly research physician Robert Baker noted that an academic advisory board he belonged to was "quite impressed by the magnitude of weight gain on olanzapine and implications for glucose."<ref name=timeso/>

Lilly told its sales representatives to play down in conversations with doctors their own published data, which has shown that 30 percent of patients taking Zyprexa gain 22 pounds or more after a year on the drug. Another study showed 16% of Zyprexa patients gained at least 30&nbsp;kg (66 pounds) in one year, and some patients have reported gaining 100 pounds or more. Between 1995 to 2004, Lilly was concerned that Zyprexa’s sales would be hurt if the company was more forthright about the fact that the drug might cause unmanageable weight gain or [[diabetes]]. In 2002, British and Japanese regulatory agencies warned that Zyprexa may be linked to diabetes, but even after the FDA issued a similar warning in 2003, Lilly did not publicly disclose their own findings.

In 2006, Lilly paid $700 million to settle 8,000 lawsuits from people who said they had developed diabetes or other diseases after taking Zyprexa.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/business/04drug.html?ref=health NYtimes.com] Mother Wonders if Psychosis Drug Helped Kill Son, New York Times, January 4, 2007</ref>
