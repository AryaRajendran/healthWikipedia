The term '''Klismaphilia''' (sometimes spelled ''Klysmaphilia'') refers to the receiving of sexual arousal from introducing liquids into the rectum and colon via the anus. This [[paraphilia]] often involves the use of [[enema]]s.<ref>[http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/paraphilias.html Paraphilias] from [http://www.psychologytoday.com Psychology Today]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|year=1973 | month=April|title=Klismaphilia: enema as a sexual preference.

Klismaphiliacs can gain satisfaction through enema fantasies, by actually receiving one, or through the process of eliminating steps to receiving one.<ref name="Denko"/> Klismaphilia is practiced by both men and women, although as with most paraphilias men are more likely to be klismaphiliacs.<ref name="Agnew"/><ref name="Denko"/> They may also gain pleasure from a large, water distended belly or the feeling of internal pressure. Often klismaphiliacs report discovering these desires after a chance administration of an enema sometime in their childhood, but some do report discovering these feelings later on.<ref name="Agnew"/> Klismaphilia is practiced both heterosexually and homosexually.<ref name="Agnew"/><ref name="Denko"/> The paraphilia may be used as a substitute or as an auxiliary by its practitioners for genital intercourse.<ref name="Denko"/> Usually klismaphiliacs carry out normal lives and successfully engage in this behavior secretly. Klismaphiliacs may also try to get others to administer enemas under the pretense of being constipated.<ref name="Denko"/> If this is the case they will probably try to conceal the pleasure they receive from these administrations.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) classifies klismaphilia under the diagnosis of "Paraphilias, Not Otherwise Specified." The diagnostic code is 302.9.<ref name="DSM">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision. Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000.</ref> There is usually no question of treating klismaphilics since there is almost never any desire to be "cured".<ref name="Denko"/> Health treatment for klismaphilia thus is typically only focused on ensuring the techniques employed and chemicals used are not harmful to the practitioner.<ref name="Denko"/> Caution should always be maintained on the part of the practitioners experimenting with new techniques and concoctions; in certain cases cramps produced by the chemicals used have led to hospitalizations,<ref name="Denko"/> in other circumstances the effects can even be life-threatening.<ref name="Case report">{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/y441825m5135088x/fulltext.pdf |title=Rectal Impaction With Epoxy Resin: A Case Report |publisher=Springerlink.com |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref>
