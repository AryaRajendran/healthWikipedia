'''Biotin''', also known as '''vitamin H''' or '''coenzyme R''',<ref>{{cite web| publisher=The Free Medical Dictionary| title=Biotin| url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/biotin| accessdate=2011-10-10}}</ref> is a water-soluble [[B vitamins|B-vitamin]] (vitamin B<sub>7</sub>). 

It is composed of a ureido (tetrahydroimidizalone) ring fused with a [[tetrahydrothiophene]] ring. A [[valeric acid]] substituent is attached to one of the carbon atoms of the tetrahydrothiophene ring.  Biotin is a [[coenzyme]] for carboxylase enzymes, involved in the synthesis of [[fatty acid]]s, [[isoleucine]], and [[valine]], and in [[gluconeogenesis]].

==General overview==
[[File:M. Dean Burk.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Dean Burk]], American biochemist who co-discovered biotin.]]
Biotin is necessary for cell growth, the production of fatty acids, and the metabolism of fats and [[amino acids]]. Biotin assists in various metabolic reactions involving the transfer of [[carbon dioxide]]. It may also be helpful in maintaining a steady [[blood sugar]] level.<ref>[http://www.supplementinfo.org/index.php?src=news&srctype=detail&category=Supplements%20In%20The%20News&refno=122 Supplementinfo.org]</ref> Biotin is often recommended as a [[dietary supplement]] for strengthening hair and nails, though scientific data supporting this usage are weak.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/vitamin-h-000342.htm|title=Vitamin H (Biotin)|date=1 June 2011|publisher=[[University of Maryland Medical Center]]|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-313-BIOTIN.aspx?activeIngredientId=313&activeIngredientName=BIOTIN|title=Biotin&#124;|publisher=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> Nevertheless, biotin is found in many cosmetics and health products for the hair and skin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fiume|year=2001|title=Final report on the safety assessment of biotin|journal=[[International Journal of Toxicology]]|volume=2|pages=45–61|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11800048|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hairformula37.com/blog/Hair-Growth-With-Biotin.htm|title=Hair Growth With Biotin|publisher=[[HF37]]|accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref>

Biotin deficiency is rare because, in general, intestinal bacteria produce biotin in excess of the body's daily requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/984803-overview|title=Biotin Deficiency|date=1 August 2011|work=[[Medscape]]|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> For that reason, statutory agencies in many countries, for example the USA<ref name="The National Academies Press">{{Cite book| editor= Otten, JJ, Hellwig, JP and Meyers, LD. | title=Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements| publisher= The National Academies Press| year=  2006 | isbn = 0-309-10091-7}}</ref> and Australia,<ref>[http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/n35.pdf National Health and Medical Research Council: Nutrient Reference Values for Australia and New Zealand]</ref> do not prescribe a recommended daily intake of biotin. However, a number of [[Biotin#Metabolic_disorders|metabolic disorders]] exist in which an individual's metabolism of biotin is abnormal, such as deficiency in the holocarboxylase synthetase enzyme which covalently links biotin onto the carboxylase, where the biotin acts as a cofactor.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1586/17446651.3.6.715}}</ref>

==Biosynthesis==
Biotin has an unusual structure (see above figure), with two rings fused together via one of their sides. The two rings are ureido and [[thiophene]] moieties.  Biotin is a heterocyclic, S-containing mono[[carboxylic acid]]. It is made from two precursors, [[alanine]] and pimeloyl-CoA via three enzymes.  8-Amino-7-oxopelargonic acid synthase is a [[pyridoxal 5'-phosphate]] enzyme. The pimeloyl-CoA, could be produced by a modified fatty acid pathway involving a malonyl thioester as the starter. 7,8Diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA) aminotransferase is unusual in using [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) as the NH<sub>2</sub> donor. Dethiobiotin synthethase catalyzes the formation of the ureido ring via a DAPA carbamate activated with ATP. Biotin synthase reductively cleaves SAM into a deoxyadenosyl radical—a first radical formed on dethiobiotin is trapped by the sulfur donor, which was found to be the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) center contained in the enzyme.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Vitam.

==Cofactor biochemistry==
<small>D</small>-(+)-Biotin is a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] responsible for [[carbon dioxide]] transfer in several [[carboxylase]] [[enzyme]]s:

* [[Acetyl-CoA carboxylase|Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha]]
* [[Acetyl-CoA carboxylase|Acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta]]
* [[Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase]]
* [[Propionyl-CoA carboxylase]]
* [[Pyruvate carboxylase]]

Biotin is important in [[fatty acid synthesis]], branched-chain [[amino acid catabolism]], and [[gluconeogenesis]]. It covalently attaches to the epsilon-amino group of specific lysine residues in these carboxylases. This [[biotinylation]] reaction requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and is catalyzed by [[holocarboxylase synthetase]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zempleni J, Wijeratne SS, Hassan YI.|title=Biotin |journal=Biofactors |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=36–46 |year=2009 |pmid=19319844 |doi=10.1002/biof.8}}</ref> In bacteria, biotin is attached to biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) by biotin protein ligase (BirA in ''E. coli'').<ref>http://jn.nutrition.org/content/129/2/477S.long</ref> The attachment of biotin to various chemical sites, biotinylation, is used as an important laboratory technique to study various processes, including protein localization, [[protein-protein interaction|protein interactions]], [[DNA]] [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], and [[DNA replication|replication]].  Biotinidase itself is known to be able to biotinylate [[histone|histone proteins]],<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hymes, J; Fleischhauer, K; Wolf, B. |title=Biotinylation of histones by human serum biotinidase: assessment of biotinyl-transferase activity in sera from normal individuals and children with biotinidase deficiency |journal=Biochem Mol Med. |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=76–83 |year=1995 |pmid=8593541 |doi=10.1006/bmme.1995.1059}}</ref> but little biotin is found naturally attached to [[chromatin]].

Biotin binds very tightly to the tetrameric protein [[avidin]] (also [[streptavidin]] and [[neutravidin]]), with a [[dissociation constant]] ''K''<sub>d</sub> on the order of 10<sup>−15</sup> M, which is one of the strongest known protein-ligand interactions.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Laitinen OH, Hytonen VP, Nordlund HR, Kulomaa MS. |title=Genetically engineered avidins and streptavidins |journal=Cell Mol Life Sci. |volume=63 |issue=24 |pages=2992–3017 |year=2006 |pmid=17086379 |doi=10.1007/s00018-006-6288-z}}</ref> This is often used in different biotechnological applications. Until 2005, very harsh conditions were thought to be required to break the biotin-streptavidin bond.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Holmberg A, Blomstergren A, Nord O et al. |title=The biotin-streptavidin interaction can be reversibly broken using water at elevated temperatures |journal=Electrophoresis |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=501–10 |year=2005 |pmid=15690449 |doi=10.1002/elps.200410070}}</ref>

==Sources of biotin==
Biotin is consumed from a wide range of food sources in the diet, but few are particularly rich sources. Foods with a relatively high biotin content include [[Swiss chard]], [[raw egg]] [[yolk]] (however, the consumption of [[avidin]]-containing [[egg whites]] with egg yolks minimizes the effectiveness of egg yolk's biotin in one's body), [[Liver (food)|liver]], [[Amelanchier alnifolia|Saskatoon berries]], leafy green vegetables, and peanuts. The dietary biotin intake in Western populations has been estimated to be 35 to 70 μg/d (143–287 nmol/d).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zempleni J, Mock DM. |title=Biotin biochemistry and human requirements |journal=J Nutr Biochem.  |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=128–138 |year=1999 |pmid=15539280 |doi=10.1016/S0955-2863(98)00095-3}}</ref>

Biotin is also available in supplement form and can be found in most pharmacies. The synthetic process developed by [[Leo Sternbach]] and [[Moses Wolf Goldberg]] in the 1940s uses [[fumaric acid]] as a starting material.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dsm.com/en_US/html/dnp/prod_vit_biotin.htm |title=Biotin |accessdate=2010-02-19 |date=2009-08-31 |publisher=DSM Nutritional Products }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Bioavailability==
Biotin is also called vitamin H (the H represents ''Haar und Haut'', German words for "hair and skin") or vitamin B<sub>7</sub>. Studies on its [[bioavailability]] have been conducted in rats and in chicks. Based on these studies, biotin bioavailability may be low or variable, depending on the type of food being consumed. In general, biotin exists in food as protein-bound form or [[biocytin]].<ref name=Gropper>{{Cite book| author= Gropper S.S., Smith, J.L.,Groff, J.L.| title= Advanced nutrition and human metabolism| year=2005| publisher= Belmont| isbn= 0-534-55986-7}}</ref> Proteolysis by protease is required prior to absorption. This process assists free biotin release from biocytin and protein-bound biotin. The biotin present in corn is readily available; however, most grains have about a 20-40% bioavailability of biotin.<ref name=Combs>{{Cite book| author = Combs, Gerald F. Jr. | title= The Vitamins: Fundamental Aspects in Nutrition and Health | year= 2008| publisher= San Diego: Elsevier, Inc| isbn = 978-0-12-183493-7}}</ref>

The wide variability in biotin bioavailability may be due to the ability of an organism to break various biotin-protein bonds from food. Whether an organism has an enzyme with that ability will determine the bioavailability of biotin from the foodstuff.<ref name="Combs" />

===Factors that affect biotin requirements===
The frequency of marginal biotin status is not known, but the incidence of low circulating biotin levels in alcoholics has been found to be much greater than in the general population.  Also, relatively low levels of biotin have been reported in the urine or plasma of patients who have had a partial [[gastrectomy]] or have other causes of [[achlorhydria]], burn patients, [[epileptics]], elderly individuals, and athletes.<ref name="Combs" /> Pregnancy and [[lactation]] may be associated with an increased demand for biotin.  In pregnancy, this may be due to a possible acceleration of biotin [[catabolism]], whereas, in lactation, the higher demand has yet to be elucidated.  Recent studies have shown marginal biotin deficiency can be present in [[human gestation]], as evidenced by increased urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, decreased urinary excretion of biotin and [[bisnorbiotin]], and decreased plasma concentration of biotin.  Additionally, smoking may further accelerate biotin catabolism in women.<ref>{{Cite book| editor= Bowman, BA and Russell, RM. | title=Present Knowledge in Nutrition, Ninth Edition, Vol 1| publisher= Washington, DC: International Life Sciences Institute| year=  2006 | contribution=Biotin | isbn = 978-1-57881-198-4 }}</ref>

==Deficiency==
[[Biotin deficiency]] is rare and mild, and can be addressed with supplementation. It is caused by the consumption of raw [[egg whites]] (two or more daily for several months) due the [[avidin]] they contain, a protein which binds extremely strongly with biotin, making it unavailable. Such regimens have produced the only examples of biotin deficiency serious enough to produce symptoms.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/313.html]</ref>

The first demonstration of biotin deficiency in animals was observed in animals fed raw [[egg white]]. Rats fed egg white protein were found to develop dermatitis, [[alopecia]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.healthyhairhighlights.com/hair_loss_and_hair_growth_in_bible.html|title=Biotin deficiency craft hair loss and alopecia citation of Bible|publisher=Healthy Hair Highlights News|date=22 July 2011 | accessdate=2011-11-09}}</ref> and neuromuscular dysfunction. This syndrome, called egg white injury, was discovered to be caused by a glycoprotein found in egg white, avidin.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Avidin denatures upon heating (cooking), while the biotin remains intact.

Symptoms of biotin deficiency include:
* Hair loss ([[alopecia]])
* [[Conjunctivitis]]
* [[Dermatitis]] in the form of a scaly, red rash around the eyes, nose, mouth, and genital area.
* Neurological symptoms in adults, such as depression, lethargy, hallucination, and numbness and tingling of the extremities<ref name="The National Academies Press"/>

The characteristic facial rash, together with an unusual facial fat distribution, has been termed the "biotin-deficient face" by some experts. Individuals with hereditary disorders of biotin deficiency have evidence of impaired immune system function, including increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections.<ref name=Higdon>{{Cite book| author= Higdon, Jane  | title = An evidence-based approach to vitamins and minerals | publisher= Thieme | year =  2003 | contribution=Biotin | isbn = 978-1-58890-124-8 }}</ref>

Pregnant women tend to have a high risk of biotin deficiency. Nearly half of pregnant women have abnormal increases of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, which reflects reduced status of biotin.<ref name=Higdon /><!--pg.2--> Several studies have reported this possible biotin deficiency during the pregnancy may cause infants' congenital malformations, such as cleft palate. Mice fed with dried raw egg to induce biotin deficiency during the gestation resulted in up to 100% incidence of the infants' malnourishment. Infants and embryos are more sensitive to the biotin deficiency. Therefore, even a mild level of the mother's biotin deficiency that does not reach the appearance of physiological deficiency signs may cause a serious consequence in the infants.

==Metabolic disorders==
Inherited metabolic disorders characterized by deficient activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases are termed [[multiple carboxylase deficiency]]. These include deficiencies in the enzymes [[holocarboxylase synthetase]] or [[biotinidase]]. [[Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency]] prevents the body's cells from using biotin effectively, and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions.<ref name="Wolf B, Grier RE, Secor McVoy JR, Heard GS. 1985 53–8">{{Cite journal|author=Wolf B, Grier RE, Secor McVoy JR, Heard GS.|title=Biotinidase deficiency: a novel vitamin recycling defect |journal=J Inherit Metab Dis.|volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=53–8|year=1985 |pmid=3930841  |doi=10.1007/BF01800660}}</ref> Biochemical and clinical manifestations include: keto[[lactic acidosis]], [[organic aciduria]], [[hyperammonemia]], skin rash, feeding problems, [[hypotonia]], [[seizure]]s, [[developmental delay]], [[alopecia]], and [[coma]].

[[Biotinidase deficiency]] is not due to inadequate biotin, but rather to a deficiency in the [[enzymes]] that process it. [[Biotinidase]] catalyzes the cleavage of biotin from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides (the proteolytic degradation products of each [[holocarboxylase]]) and thereby recycles biotin. It is also important in freeing biotin from dietary protein-bound biotin.<ref name="Wolf B, Grier RE, Secor McVoy JR, Heard GS. 1985 53–8"/> General symptoms include decreased [[appetite]] and [[Human development (biology)|growth]]. Dermatologic symptoms include [[dermatitis]], alopecia, and [[achromotrichia]] (absence or loss of pigment in the hair).<ref>[http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Achromotrichia biology-online.org]</ref> [[Perosis]] (a shortening and thickening of bones) is seen in the skeleton.  [[Fatty liver and kidney syndrome]] and [[hepatic steatosis]] also can occur.<ref name="Combs" />

==Uses==

===Health and diet===

====Diabetes====
Diabetics may benefit from biotin supplementation. In both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent diabetics deficient in biotin, supplementation with biotin can improve blood sugar control and help lower fasting blood glucose levels; in one study, the reduction in fasting glucose approached 50%.<ref name="lpi.oregonstate.edu">[http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/biotin/ Oregon State University, Linus Pauling Institute, Micronutrient Research]</ref> Biotin can also play a role in preventing the neuropathy often associated with diabetes, reducing both the numbness and tingling associated with poor glucose control.<ref name="lpi.oregonstate.edu"/><ref>[http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/biotin2.htm Howstuffworks.com]</ref>

====Hair and nail problems====
The signs and symptoms of biotin deficiency include hair loss, which progresses in severity to include loss of eyelashes and eyebrows in severely deficient subjects, as well as nails that break, chip, or flake easily.<ref>{{cite web | last=Meschino Health | title=Comprehensive Guide to Biotin | url=http://www.meschinohealth.com/books/biotin | accessdate = 15 May 2012}}</ref> The recommended dose to treat deficiency for adults varies from 3,000 mcg per day for brittle fingernails up to 7,000 to 15,000 mcg per day for diabetics.<ref>{{cite web | last=Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center | title=Biotin | url=http://www.bidmc.org/YourHealth/HolisticHealth/HerbsandSupplements.aspx?ChunkID=21571 | accessdate = 15 May 2012}}</ref>

====Palmoplantar pustulosis====
Patients with [[palmoplantar pustulosis]] had metabolic derangements of glucose and fatty acids, as well as immune dysfunction derived from biotin deficiency, which led to abnormal manifestations of skin, bone and other tissues and organs. All of the clinical, metabolic and immune disorders were improved by biotin administration. These findings indicate biotin deficiency was implicated in the outbreak and exacerbation of the disease and its complications. Supplementary addition of a probiotic agent to the biotin treatment intensified the therapeutic effect of the vitamin. Additionally, patients with psoriasis vulgaris, [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[atopic dermatitis]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]] also had biotin deficiency with the subsequent metabolic abnormalities and immune dysfunction, so the biotin treatment provided beneficial effects in the therapy of the diseases, as in the case of palmoplantar pustulosis.<ref>{{cite web | last=Journal of Leukocyte Biology | title=Biotin deficiency up-regulates TNF-α production in murine macrophages | url=http://www.jleukbio.org/content/83/4/912.full | accessdate = 15 May 2012}}</ref>

====Cradle cap (seborrheic dermatitis)====
Children with a rare inherited metabolic disorder called [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU; in which one is unable to break down the amino acid phenylalanine) often develop skin conditions such as [[eczema]] and [[seborrheic dermatitis]] in areas of the body other than the scalp. The scaly skin changes that occur in people with PKU may be related to poor ability to use biotin. Increasing dietary biotin has been known to improve seborrheic dermatitis<ref>Murray, Michael; Pizzorno, Joseph (1997). "Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine" (Revised 2nd Edition) [[Three Rivers Press]]. ISBN 0-7615-1157-1</ref> in these cases.

====Biotechnology====
Biotin is widely used throughout the [[biotechnology]] industry to [[Conjugated protein|conjugate]] proteins for biochemical assays.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.piercenet.com/browse.cfm?fldID=4DDCADD2-5056-8A76-4E7E-2E00843BE346|title=Overview of Protein Labeling|publisher=[[Thermo Fisher Scientific]]|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> Biotin's small size means the biological activity of the protein will most likely be unaffected. This process is called [[biotinylation]]. Because both [[streptavidin]] and [[avidin]] bind biotin with high affinity (K<sub>d</sub> of  10<sup>−14</sup> mol/l to 10<sup>−15</sup> mol/l) and specificity, biotinylated proteins of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction.  The sample is incubated with streptavidin/avidin beads, allowing capture of the biotinylated protein of interest.  Any other proteins binding to the biotinylated molecule will also stay with the bead and all other unbound proteins can be washed away.  However, due to the extremely strong streptavidin-biotin interaction, very harsh conditions are needed to elute the biotinylated protein from the beads (typically 6M [[guanidine]] HCl at pH 1.5), which often will denature the protein of interest.  To circumvent this problem, beads conjugated to monomeric avidin can be used, which has a decreased biotin-binding affinity of ~10<sup>−8</sup> mol/l, allowing the biotinylated protein of interest to be eluted with excess free biotin.

[[ELISA]]s often make use of biotinylated secondary antibodies against the antigen of interest, followed by a detection step using streptavidin conjugated to a reporter molecule, such as [[horseradish peroxidase]] or [[alkaline phosphatase]].

==Toxicity==
Animal studies have indicated few, if any, effects due to high level doses of biotin.  This may provide evidence that both animals and humans could tolerate doses of at least an order of magnitude greater than each of their nutritional requirements.  There are no reported cases of adverse effects from receiving high doses of the vitamin, in particular, when used in the treatment of metabolic disorders causing sebhorrheic [[dermatitis]] in infants.<ref name=Combs2>{{Cite book| author = Combs, Gerald F.
