'''A delta fibers''', or Aδ fibers, are a [[type of sensory fiber]]. 

They respond to stimuli such as cold and pressure, and as [[nociceptors]] stimulation of them is interpreted as fast/first [[pain]] information. 

They are thinly [[myelin]]ated, thus they send impulses faster than unmyelinated [[C fiber]]s, but more slowly than other, more thickly myelinated "A" class fibers.

The fibers terminate at [[Rexed lamina|Rexed laminae]] I and V.<ref>Basbaum et al. 2009. Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Pain. Cell 139. DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2009.09.028 -  Available at http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0092867409012434/1-s2.0-S0092867409012434-main.pdf?_tid=1ad886f0258c3fb66e249ad7a37df3e2&acdnat=1337524198_340d33507bdc41242daa6a3a72b2cf0a</ref>

==Structure==
They are thin (2 to 5 μm in diameter), [[myelin]]ated [[axons]] with a moderate [[conduction velocity]], or speed of travel of a nerve signal (2 to 30 m/s).  These [[nerve]] fibers are associated with acute (sharp) [[Pain and nociception|pain]] and therefore constitute the [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] portion of the  [[reflex arc]] that results in "pulling away" from noxious stimuli (e.g. retracting your hand away from a hot stove). A certain proportion of Aδ fibers are also associated with sensations of [[temperature]] (also known as '[[cold receptors]]' in [[mammals]]) and [[pressure]].  Slowly-conducting, unmyelinated [[C fiber]]s, by contrast, carry slow, burning pain.

Like other sensory fibers, the Aδ fiber is an extension of a [[pseudounipolar neuron|pseudounipolar]] [[neuron]] with its [[cell body]] located in a [[dorsal root ganglion]] or trigeminal ganglion.  Within the [[spinal cord]], afferent [[Pain and nociception|nociceptor]] fibers [[synapse]] at or near the spinal cord level where they enter.
