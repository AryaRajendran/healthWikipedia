The reason for the development of the field of medicine gives the fact that [[mass gathering]]s generate a higher incidence of injury and illness, may be the subject to a catastrophic accident or attack with large numbers of injured or dead persons.<ref>Franaszek J:Medical care at mass gatherings. Ann Emerg Med 1986;15:60-61</ref><ref>Thompson JM et al:Level of medical care required for mass gatherings: The XV Winter Olympic Games in Calgary, Canada. Ann Emerg Med 1991;20(4):385-390</ref>

Mass Gathering Medicine is viewed as a niche field of prehospital care in [[emergency medicine]] at the University of British Columbia <ref>http://mgm.sites.olt.ubc.ca/</ref>

Among factors influencing on the demand for the health care at mass gatherings <ref>Milsten AM et al:Mass gathering medical care: A review of the literature. Prehosp Disast Med 2002;17(3):151-162</ref> are:
*the weather,
*duration of the event,
*if the crowd moves,
*containment of the event (fenced/contained or not),
*availability of alcohol/drugs,
*the density of the crowd et al.,
*possibility for spreading of communicable diseases <ref>{{cite web|title=Communicable disease alert and response for mass gatherings|url=http://www.who.int/csr/Mass_gatherings2.pdf | accessdate =2010-11-04}}</ref>

Key purposes of Mass Gathering Medical  Services at an event<ref>De Lorenzo  RA:Mass gathering medicine: A review. Prehosp Disast Med 1997;12(1):68-72</ref> are:
*rapid access to the injured or ill patients,
