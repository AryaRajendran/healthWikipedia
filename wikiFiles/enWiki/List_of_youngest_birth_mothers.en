| [[Lina Medina]], from the [[Ticrapo District]] of Peru, gave birth by [[cesarean section]] in [[Lima]] at age {{frac|5|1|2}}. The infant was a {{convert|2.64|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, {{convert|47.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} boy named Gerardo. Medina's parents, who assumed their daughter had a [[tumor]], took her to a hospital in late March, where she was found to be 7 months pregnant.

Gryshchenko's parents did not want the obstetricians to perform a cesarean section, as it was considered dangerous at the time. The {{convert|3|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, {{convert|52|cm|in|abbr=on}} infant girl died during labor due to an early [[placenta]]l tear; she had been born at full term and apparently of good constitution, and, according to doctors, would have survived if she had been extracted more quickly, reanimated, and oxygenated.

| A 10-year-old girl from Lagoa Grande, [[Minas Gerais]] gave birth to a boy by cesarean section in late April 2009. The director of her school learned of the girl's pregnancy on March 20 after hearing about it in playground discussions among children. The director alerted the judicial and medical-social authorities, and immediately took her to the clinic, where her condition was confirmed: the girl was almost 8 months pregnant, though it was not visible on her. That evening, she exposed her stepfather, who was arrested as he tried to escape to Gurupi in [[Tocantins]], {{convert|470|mi}} to the north, and jailed. He impregnated her in late July 2008, four months after he started abusing her in late March.<ref>{{Pt icon}} {{cite web|url=http://mais.uol.com.br/view/1575mnadmj5c/mg-menina-de-10-anos-e-abusada-e-esta-gravida-04023066DCA98326?types=A|title=Minas Gerais: menina de 10 anos é abusada e está grávida|trans_title=Minas Gerais: 10-year-old girl is abused and is pregnant|date=2009-03-20|work=UOL Mais}}</ref><ref>{{Pt icon}} {{cite web|url=http://wwo.uai.com.br/UAI/html/sessao_2/2009/03/21/em_noticia_interna,id_sessao=2&id_noticia=103427/em_noticia_interna.shtml|title=Meninas de 10 e 15 anos grávidas|trans_title=Girls ages 10 and 15 are pregnant|date=2009-03-21|work=UAI}}</ref>
