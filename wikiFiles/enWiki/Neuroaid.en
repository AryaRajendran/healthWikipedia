'''NeuroAiD (MLC 601)''' is a natural treatment for [[stroke]]. The treatment was historically developed in [[China]] as a [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] (TCM) to help stroke patients achieve rehabilitation at late stage. Each year 150,000 patients are treated in China. NeuroAiD was introduced on the international markets in 2006 by Moleac Pte Ltd, a [[biopharmaceutical]] company in Singapore. [[Moleac]] developed NeuroAiD by making the link between the traditional Chinese medicine and [[biotechnologies]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sim.edu.sg/mbs/pub/mag/mbs_pub_mag_list.cfm?ID=2163&mnuid=92 |title=Uncovering New Drugs from Traditional Cures |first=N. |last=Ravindran |publisher=[[Singapore Institute of Management]] |date=December 2006–January 2007}}{{MEDRS|date=August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Noor |last=Aisha |date=October 15, 2006 |work=The Business Times |title=New TCM drug offers hope for stroke patients |url=http://www.neuroaid.com/articles/New-TCM-drug-offers-hope-for-stroke-patients.pdf}}{{Verify credibility|date=April 2010}}</ref>

==General information==

=== NeuroAiD I and NeuroAiD II===
There are two versions of NeuroAiD: NeuroAiD (MLC601) and NeuroAiD II (MLC901). MLC 601 and 901 refer to the blend of natural ingredients.<ref name=pmid20064536>{{cite journal |author=Heurteaux C, Gandin C, Borsotto M, ''et al.'' |title=Neuroprotective and neuroproliferative activities of NeuroAid (MLC601, MLC901), a Chinese medicine, in vitro and in vivo |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=58 |issue=7 |pages=987–1001 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20064536 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2010.01.001}}</ref>

NeuroAiD is a natural add-on to stroke treatment. In many countries it is prescribed by neurologists or available Over the Counter from pharmacies. These distributors are mainly in Asia, for example It is possible to buy NeuroAiD in pharmacies in Singapore as it has officially been registered as a Chinese Proprietary Medicine in Singapore (July 2006).<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[AsiaOne]] |url=http://health.asiaone.com.sg/alternativemedicine/20070430_001.html |archiveurl=http://www.neuroaid.com/articles/Chinese-medicine-to-help-stroke-victims.pdf |archivedate=April 30, 2007 |date=April 30, 2007 |title=Chinese medicine to help stroke victims |first=Raymond Poon}}{{Verify credibility|date=April 2010}}</ref>

===Composition===
NeuroAiD is made of 14 ingredients from the Chinese [[pharmacopoeia]] which main ingredients are : ''[[Astragalus propinquus|Radix Astragali]]'', ''[[Salvia miltiorrhiza|Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae]]'', ''Radix Paeoniae Rubra'', ''Radix Polygalae'', and ''[[Angelica sinensis|Radix Angelicae Sinensis]]''.<ref>ezyhealth&beauty Magazine,05/2007''Renewing hope''p28-29{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}</ref>

===Quality standards===
Neuroaid is manufactured according to prevailing [[Good Manufacturing Practices]] (GMP). In 2002, TCM were recognized as medicines by the [[World Health Organisation]].<ref>{{cite web |first1=David |last1=Pricard |last2=[[Moleac]] |date=May 17, 2007 |title=Going West With Eastern Medicine - Traditional Chinese Medicine Is Entering The Mainstream In Terms Western Practitioners Understand |work=[[Medical News Today]] |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/71151.php}}{{Verify credibility|date=April 2010}}</ref>

==Dosage==
The normal treatment is four capsules are to be taken three times a day during three months for the normal treatment. The ”starter” treatment is four capsules three times a day during one month.

==Mechanisms of action==
The latest study has established the [[neuroproliferative]] and [[neuroprotective]] effect of NeuroAiD601 hence its potential role in [[neuroplasticity]] after stroke.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chen C, Venketasubramanian N, Gan RN, ''et al.'' |title=Danqi Piantang Jiaonang (DJ), a traditional Chinese medicine, in poststroke recovery |journal=Stroke; a Journal of Cerebral Circulation |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=859–63 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19164787 |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.531616}}</ref> NeuroAiD has been proved to stimulates the secretion of [[BDNF]]. The in vitro and in vivo results show that NeuroAiD makes cell more resistant against glutamate aggression, increases [[neurite]] outgrowth and connectivity as well as reduces the infarct volume, therefore results in better neurological functions.<ref name=pmid20064536/>

==Safety and Efficacy==
NeuroAiD has not completed the four necessary [[clinical trial]] phases to be recorded as a prescribed drug in Europe or the USA. Yet This treatment is already registered in many Asian countries such as Singapore, China, the Philippines, Iran where it is sold as a legal natural add-on to stroke therapy.

===Interactions and side effect===
Research on [[drug interactions]] with [[aspirin]] as an [[antiplatelet]] agent were conducted and revealed no severe [[side effect]]. Yet today, no other interaction researches have been recorded so far. According to Neuroaid website Moleac's pharmaco vigilance database has no side effects NeuroAiD stroke treatment, and therefore a need to drink more water. These interactions are said to be rare (0,5% of patients).<ref>http://www.neuroaid.com/en/about_neuroaid/safety_data</ref>

===Biochemical tests===
Biochemical tests were conducted in 2008 to show NeuroAiD do not modify hemostasis hematology and biochemistry in normal subjects and stroke patients.<ref name=pmid18417963>{{cite journal |author=Gan R, Lambert C, Lianting J, ''et al.'' |title=Danqi Piantan Jiaonang does not modify hemostasis, hematology, and biochemistry in normal subjects and stroke patients |journal=Cerebrovascular Diseases |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=450–6 |year=2008 |pmid=18417963 |doi=10.1159/000126919}}</ref> This clinical trial revealed no interaction were recorded with aspirin. More, the treatment does not increase the risk of bleeding, [[thrombosis]] and has no effect on blood pressure, liver, or kidneys  functions.<ref name=pmid18417963/> This data supported the idea of prescribing Neuroaid as an add-on to existing treatment received by post stroke treatment, as it is now performed in the CHIMES study.

==Efficacy==

===Laboratory studies===
Heurteaux C., Lazdunski M. and a few other scientists demonstrated in a cell and rodent models of focal [[ischemia]] that NeuroAiDII (MLC 901) had neuroprotective, neuroplasticity and neuroproliferative (neurogenesis) effects.<ref name=pmid20064536/> To cut a long story short this means the treatment has three effects: first to strengthen the neurons ([[neuroprotection]]), second to enable  neurons to create connections which were initially done by the tissues damaged by the stroke, and third trigger the growth of new neurons in the brain, which may take over some of the processing previously done by the necrosed tissues.<ref name=pmid20064536/><ref>{{cite press release |title=Moleac Announces Breakthrough Results on Neuroprotective and Neurogenerative Properties of NeuroAiD |publisher=[[Moleac]] |date=February 11, 2010 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/prnewswire/press_releases/Singapore/2010/02/11/HKTH002 |accessdate=2010-04-01}}</ref>

===Clinical Trials===

====Large scale trial at the chronic stage of Stroke====
In January 2009, Stoke published a paper summarizing clinical trial comparing NeuroAiD to another Traditional Chinese Medicine on 605 patients in post stroke recovery. Patients started Neuroaid at least two weeks and less than 6 month after their stroke. The research revealed using NeuroAiD gave 2,4 more chances{{Clarify|date=October 2012}} to achieve independence, and on average reduces 25% of motor deficits. This study did not record any serious side effects.<ref name=pmid19164787>{{cite journal |author=Chen C, Venketasubramanian N, Gan RN, ''et al.'' |title=Danqi Piantang Jiaonang (DJ), a traditional Chinese medicine, in poststroke recovery |journal=Stroke |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=859–63 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19164787 |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.531616}}</ref>

====Large scale trial at the acute stage of Stroke====
A large scale clinical trial is being conducted in Asia on 1100 patients, initiated on Neuroaid within 72 hours of the stroke onset. The study is conducted according to latest methodology on stroke trials and in compliance with [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|ICH]] and [[Good clinical practice|GCP]] standards. A patient takes four capsules three times a day for three months as an add on to medication. The study protocol has been published in the international journal of stroke and updates are available on clinicaltrials.gov.<ref name=pmid19164787/><ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=neuroaid</ref>

====Other pilot studies====

=====Tiers=====
The double blind placebo-controlled randomized Phase II Pilot study called TIERS was conducted on 40 patients receiving four capsules of NeuroAiD (MLC601) 3 times a day for four weeks. The treatment was initiated less than one month after the stroke. The results published in 2009 showed that NeuroAiD was 58% more efficient than the placebo panel and that the five best NeuroAiD responders recovered 39% more than the five best placebo responders.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kong KH, Wee SK, Ng CY, ''et al.'' |title=A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II pilot study to investigate the potential efficacy of the traditional chinese medicine Neuroaid (MLC 601) in enhancing recovery after stroke (TIERS) |journal=Cerebrovascular Diseases |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=514–21 |year=2009 |pmid=19816018 |doi=10.1159/000247001}}</ref>

=====European Neurology=====
European Neurology, initiated in 2008, is a case reports made on 10 patients who received two to three months of treatment. NeuroAiD was initiated between one week to six months after stroke. Improvements were seen on both motor balance, visual and speech functions. Results showed six full recoveries, two good recoveries one moderate recovery and one poor recovery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Siow CH |title=Neuroaid in stroke recovery |journal=European Neurology |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=264–6 |year=2008 |pmid=18781074 |doi=10.1159/000155220}}</ref>
