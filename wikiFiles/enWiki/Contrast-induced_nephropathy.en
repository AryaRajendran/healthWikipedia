'''[[Radiocontrast|Contrast]]-induced [[nephropathy]]''' is defined as either a greater than 25% increase of [[serum creatinine]] or an absolute increase in serum creatinine of 0.5&nbsp;mg/dL<ref name="pmid16436769">{{cite journal |author=Barrett BJ, Parfrey PS |title=Clinical practice. Preventing nephropathy induced by contrast medium |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=354 |issue=4 |pages=379–86 |year=2006 |pmid=16436769 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp050801}}</ref> after a [[Medical imaging#Radiographic|radiographic examination]] using a [[contrast agent]].

A new definition of contrast nephropathy in patients undergoing [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] was recently proposed by Harjai, et al.  This tripartite definition classifies contrast nephropathy as grade 0 (serum creatinine increase <25% above baseline and <0.5&nbsp;mg/dL above baseline), grade 1 (serum creatinine increase >/=25% above baseline and <0.5&nbsp;mg/dL above baseline), or grade 2 (serum creatinine increase >/=0.5&nbsp;mg/dL above baseline).  This classification is prognostic of long-term outcomes of patients after percutaneous coronary intervention.  Patients with grade 2 nephropathy had the worst outcome while those with grade 0 nephropathy had the best outcome on long-term follow-up.<ref>Harjai KJ, et al.

==Risk factors==
To minimize the risk for contrast-induced nephropathy, various actions can be taken if the patient has predisposing conditions. These have been reviewed in a [[meta-analysis]].<ref name="pmid16788132">{{cite journal |author=Pannu N, Wiebe N, Tonelli M |title=Prophylaxis strategies for contrast-induced nephropathy |journal=JAMA |volume=295 |issue=23 |pages=2765–79 |year=2006 |pmid=16788132 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.23.2765}}</ref> A separate [[meta-analysis]] addresses interventions in for emergent patients with baseline renal insufficiency.<ref name="pmid17512638">{{cite journal |author=Sinert R, Doty CI |title=Evidence-based emergency medicine review.

Three factors have been associated with an increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy: preexisting [[renal insufficiency]] (such as [[Creatinine clearance]] < 60 mL/min [1.00 mL/s] - [http://www.intmed.mcw.edu/clincalc/creatinine.html online calculator]), preexisting [[diabetes]], and reduced intravascular volume.<ref name="pmid9375704">{{cite journal | author=McCullough PA, Wolyn R, Rocher LL, Levin RN, O'Neill WW | title=Acute renal failure after coronary intervention: incidence, risk factors, and relationship to mortality | journal=Am J Med | year=1997 | pages=368–75 | volume=103 | issue=5  | pmid=9375704 | doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(97)00150-2}}</ref><ref name="pmid10334456">{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00126-6 | author=Scanlon PJ, Faxon DP, Audet AM, Carabello B, Dehmer GJ, Eagle KA, Legako RD, Leon DF, Murray JA, Nissen SE, Pepine CJ, Watson RM, Ritchie JL, Gibbons RJ, Cheitlin MD, Gardner TJ, Garson A Jr, Russell RO Jr, Ryan TJ, Smith SC Jr | title=ACC/AHA guidelines for coronary angiography.

==Choice of contrast agent==
The [[osmolality]] of the [[contrast agent]] was previously believed to be of paramount importance in contrast-induced nephropathy. Today it has become increasingly clear that other physicochemical properties play a greater role, such as [[viscosity]]. Attention should be paid to use contrast agents of low viscosity. Moreover, sufficient fluids should be supplied to limit fluid viscosity of urine. Modern iodinated contrast agents are non-ionic, the older ionic types caused more adverse effects and are not used much anymore.

A former study suggested that iso-osmolar, nonionic contrast media may be superior to others. [[randomized controlled trial]].<ref name="pmid12571256">{{cite journal |author=Aspelin P, Aubry P, Fransson S, Strasser R, Willenbrock R, Berg K |title=Nephrotoxic effects in high-risk patients undergoing angiography |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=348 |issue=6 |pages=491–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12571256 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa021833}}</ref> However, several subsequent studies failed to confirm this. A large scale study strongly suggested that an iso-osmolar contrast media more often cause clinically relevant kidney failure than a low-osmolar contrast agent.<ref name="pmid17003814">{{cite journal |author=Liss P, Persson PB, Hansell P, Lagerqvist B |title=Renal failure in 57 925 patients undergoing coronary procedures using iso-osmolar or low-osmolar contrast media |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=70 |issue=10 |pages=1811–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17003814 |doi=10.1038/sj.ki.5001887}}</ref>

==Hydration with or without bicarbonate==
Administration of sodium bicarbonate 3 mL/kg per hour for 1 hour before, followed by 1 mL/kg per hour for 6 hours after contrast was found superior to plain saline on one [[randomized controlled trial]] of patients with a creatinine of at least 1.1&nbsp;mg/dL (97.2 µmol/L) .<ref name="pmid15150204">{{cite journal |author=Merten G, Burgess W, Gray L, Holleman J, Roush T, Kowalchuk G, Bersin R, Van Moore A, Simonton C, Rittase R, Norton H, Kennedy T |title=Prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy with sodium bicarbonate: a randomized controlled trial |journal=JAMA |volume=291 |issue=19 |pages=2328–34 |year=2004 |pmid=15150204 |doi=10.1001/jama.291.19.2328}}</ref> To make the solution, the study used 154 mL of 1000 mEq/L sodium bicarbonate to 846 mL of 5% dextrose. This is approximately three 50 ml ampules of bicarbonate in 850 ml of water with 5% dextrose.  This was subsequently corroborated by a multi-center [[randomized controlled trial]], which also demonstrated that IV hydration with sodium bicarbonate was superior to 0.9% normal saline.<ref name="pmid17309916">{{cite journal |author=Briguori C, Airoldi F, D'Andrea D, Bonizzoni E, Morici N, Focaccio A, Michev I, Montorfano M, Carlino M, Cosgrave J, Ricciardelli B, Colombo A |title=Renal Insufficiency Following Contrast Media Administration Trial (REMEDIAL): a randomized comparison of 3 preventive strategies |journal=Circulation |volume=115 |issue=10 |pages=1211–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17309916 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.687152}}</ref>  However, additional [[confirmatory trial]]s with sodium bicarbonate are needed because the largest trial to date showed no benefit of sodium bicarbonate over normal saline .<ref name="PMID18768415">{{cite journal |author=Brar SS, Shen AY, Jorgensen MB, Kotlewski A, Aharonian VJ, Desai N, Ree M, Shah AI, Burchette RJ|title=Sodium bicarbonate vs sodium chloride for the prevention of contrast medium-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing coronary angiography: a randomized trial |journal=JAMA |volume=300 |issue=9 |pages=1038–46 |year=2008 |pmid=18768415 |doi=10.1001/jama.300.9.1038}}</ref> The renoprotective effects of bicarbonate are thought to be due to urinary alkalinization, which creates an environment less amenable to the formation of harmful [[free radicals]].<ref name="pmid11822926">{{cite journal |author=Mueller C, Buerkle G, Buettner H, Petersen J, Perruchoud A, Eriksson U, Marsch S, Roskamm H |title=Prevention of contrast media-associated nephropathy: randomized comparison of 2 hydration regimens in 1620 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=329–36 |year=2002 |pmid=11822926 |doi=10.1001/archinte.162.3.329}}</ref>

Alternatively, one [[randomized controlled trial]] of patients with a creatinine over 1.6&nbsp;mg per deciliter (140 µmol per liter) or creatinine clearance below 60 ml per minute used 1 ml/kg of 0.45 percent saline per per hour for 6–12 hours before and after the contrast.<ref name="pmid7969280">{{cite journal |author=Solomon R, Werner C, Mann D, D'Elia J, Silva P |title=Effects of saline, mannitol, and furosemide to prevent acute decreases in renal function induced by radiocontrast agents |journal=N.
