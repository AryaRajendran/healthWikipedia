'''Aicardi syndrome''' is a rare genetic [[congenital disorder|malformation syndrome]] characterized by the partial or complete absence of a key structure in the brain called the [[agenesis of the corpus callosum|corpus callosum]], the presence of retinal abnormalities, and [[seizures]] in the form of [[infantile spasms]]. Aicardi syndrome is theorized to  be caused by a defect on the [[X chromosome]] as it has thus far only been observed in girls or in boys with [[Klinefelter syndrome]]. Confirmation of this theory awaits the discovery of the [[gene]] which causes Aicardi syndrome.  Symptoms typically appear before a baby reaches about 5 months of age.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

== History ==

This disorder was first recognized as a distinct syndrome in 1965 by [[Jean Aicardi]], a French neurologist.   A review article by Dr. Aicardi (Aicardi J, Aicardi syndrome: old and new findings, Int Pediatr. 1998;14(1):5-8) describes the syndrome.  Aicardi syndrome should not be confused with [[Aicardi-Goutières syndrome]], a distinct disorder.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

== Epidemiology ==

Worldwide prevalence of Aicardi Syndrome is estimated at several thousand, with approximately 900 cases reported in the United States.<ref>[http://jcn.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/23/5/531 Kroner et al. J Child Neurol 2008;23:531–5]</ref>

Almost all reported cases of Aicardi syndrome have been in females. The few males that have been identified with Aicardi syndrome have proved to have 47 chromosomes including an [[XXY]] sex chromosome complement, a condition called [[Klinefelter syndrome]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Aicardi syndrome appears to be lethal in normal males who have only one [[X chromosome]] (and a [[Y chromosome]]). In other words, Aicardi syndrome appears to be inherited in an [[X-linked dominant]] pattern due to a mutant gene on the [[X chromosome]] that is lethal in XY males.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

All cases of Aicardi syndrome are thought to be due to new [[mutations]]. No person with Aicardi syndrome is known to have transmitted the X-linked gene responsible for the syndrome to the next generation.

== Features ==

Children are most commonly identified with Aicardi syndrome before the age of five months. A significant number of girls are products of normal births and seem to be developing normally until around the age of three months, when they begin to have [[infantile spasm]]s. The onset of infantile spasms at this age is due to closure of the final neural synapses in the brain, a stage of normal [[brain development]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

== Diagnosis ==

Aicardi syndrome is typically characterized by the following triad of features - however, one of the "classic" features being missing does not preclude a diagnosis of Aicardi Syndrome, if other supporting features are present.<ref>[http://int-pediatrics.com/PDF/Volume%2014/14-1/aicardi.pdf Aicardi, J. Int Pediatr. 1998;14(1):5-8.]</ref>
# Partial or complete absence of the [[corpus callosum]] in the brain ([[agenesis of the corpus callosum]]);
# Eye abnormalities known as "[[lacuna]]e" of the retina that are quite specific to this disorder; [[morning glory syndrome]] optic disc anomaly; and
# The development in infancy of seizures that are called [[infantile spasms]].

Other types of defects of the brain such as [[microcephaly]], [[polymicrogyria]], [[porencephaly|porencephalic cyst]]s and enlarged [[Ventricular system|cerebral ventricle]]s due to [[hydrocephalus]] are also common in Aicardi syndrome.

== Treatment ==

Treatment of Aicardi syndrome primarily involves management of seizures and early/continuing intervention programs for developmental delays.

Additional complications sometimes seen with Aicardi syndrome include [[porencephaly|porencephalic cyst]]s and [[hydrocephalus]], and gastro-intestinal problems.  Treatment for prencephalic cysts and/or hydrocephalus is often via a [[cerebral shunt|shunt]] or [[endoscopic]] [[wikt:fenestration|fenestration]] of the cysts, though some require no treatment. Placement of a [[feeding tube]], fundoplication, and surgeries to correct hernias or other gastrointestinal structural problems are sometimes used to treat gastro-intestinal issues.

== Prognosis ==

The [[prognosis]] varies widely from case to case, depending on the severity of the symptoms. However, almost all people reported with Aicardi syndrome to date have experienced developmental delay of a significant degree, typically resulting in moderate to profound [[mental retardation]]. The age range of the individuals reported with Aicardi syndrome is from birth to the mid 40s.
There is no cure for this syndrome.
