{{Hypnosis}}
'''Hypnosurgery''' is the term given to an [[surgery|operation]] where the [[patient]] is [[sedation|sedated]] using [[hypnotherapy]] rather than traditional [[anesthesia|anaesthetics]]. It is still in its experimental stages, and not often used. 
During hypnosurgery, the [[hypnosis|hypnotist]] helps the patient control their [[unconscious mind|subconscious]] reflexes so that they do not feel [[Pain and nociception|pain]] in the traditional sense.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Patients are aware of sensation as the operation progresses and often describe a tingling or tickling sensation when pain would normally be expected.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

What is more frequently used is hypnosedation, a combination regimen of hypnosis, local injection of analgesics and mild sedation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The patients -mostly aged or other persons that run an increased risk under general anesthesia - are mildly sedated and brought in a state of increased alertness by having them listen to a story in the operation theatre.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Anesthesiologists at the University of Liège in Belgium have performed over 4800 surgical interventions, mainly in ENT and thyroid treatments, over the past 10 years.<ref>http://www2.ulg.ac.be/anesrea/</ref>
 
The main benefit of hypnosurgery is that there are fewer side effects, and generally a patient can leave [[hospital]] sooner than if normal anaesthetics are used.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A reduction in [[blood loss]] and [[postoperative nausea and vomiting|post-operative nausea]] have also been recorded.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} 

In April 2006, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television channel]] [[More4]] broadcast a live [[hernia]] hypnosurgery operation.{{fact|date=April 2013}}
