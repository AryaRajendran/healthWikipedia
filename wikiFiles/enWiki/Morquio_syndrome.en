'''Morquio's syndrome''' (referred to as '''[[mucopolysaccharidosis]] IV''' or '''Morquio's''')  is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[mucopolysaccharide]] storage disease (see also [[lysosomal storage disorder]]), usually inherited.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |last2=Berger |first2=Timothy G. |display-authors=3}}</ref>{{rp|544}} It is a rare type of [[birth defect]] with serious consequences. When the body cannot process certain types of [[mucopolysaccharides]], they build up or are eliminated, causing various symptoms. These involve accumulation of [[keratan sulfate]].<ref name="pmid18456538">{{cite journal |author=Prat C, Lemaire O, Bret J, Zabraniecki L, Fournié B |title=Morquio syndrome: Diagnosis in an adult |journal=Joint Bone Spine |volume= 75|issue= 4|pages= 495–8|year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18456538 |doi=10.1016/j.jbspin.2007.07.021 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1297-319X(08)00094-8}}</ref>

== History ==
The condition was first described, simultaneously and independently, in 1929, by [[Luis Morquio]] (1867–1935), a well-known Uruguayan physician who discovered it in Montevideo, and [[James Frederick Brailsford]] (1888–1961), an English radiographer in Birmingham, England.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2108}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=L.|last=Morquio |title={{lang|fr|Sur une forme de dystrophie osseuse familiale}} |journal=Archives de médecine des infants |location=Paris |year=1929 |volume=32 |issue= |pages=129–135 |doi= |pmid= |issn=0365-4311 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

They both recognized the occurrence of corneal clouding, aortic valve disease, and urinary excretion of keratan sulfate. Morquio observed the disorder in four siblings in a family of Swedish extraction and reported his observations in French. The chances of getting Morquio is 1 in 200,000.

== Symptoms ==

The following symptoms are associated with Morquio's syndrome:

*Abnormal heart development
*Abnormal skeletal development
*Hypermobile joints
*Large fingers
*[[Genu valgum|Knock-knees]]
*Widely spaced teeth
*Bell-shaped chest (flared ribs)
*Compression of spinal cord
*Enlarged heart
*[[Dwarfism]]
* heart murmur
* below average height for certain age
Patients with Morquio's syndrome appear healthy at birth. They are often present with spinal deformity, and there is growth retardation and possibly [[genu valgum]] in the second or third year of life.  A patient with Morquio's syndrome is likely to die at an early age.  Other symptoms of the disease may include:

*Short stature and short neck (caused by flat [[vertebra|vertebrae]])
*Moderate [[kyphosis]] or [[scoliosis]]
*Mild [[pectus carinatum]] ("pigeon chest")
*Cervical spine: odontoid [[hypoplasia]], atlanto-axial instability; may be associated with [[myelopathy]] with gradual loss of walking ability
*Joint laxity, mild [[dysostosis multiplex]], dysplastic hips, large unstable knees, large elbows and wrists, and flat feet
*The combined abnormalities usually result in a duck-waddling [[gait]]
*Mid-face hypoplasia and mandibular protrusion
*Thin [[tooth enamel]]
*Corneal clouding
*Mild [[hepatosplenomegaly]]

Life span: some can die as early as 2 or 3 and some can live up to 60 or 70 years old.

==Treatment==
The treatment for Morquio's syndrome consists of [[prenatal diagnosis|prenatal identification]] and of [[enzyme replacement therapy]].
