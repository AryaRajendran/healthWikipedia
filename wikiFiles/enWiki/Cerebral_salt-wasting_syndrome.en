'''Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome''' ('''CSWS''') is a [[rare disease|rare]] endocrine condition featuring [[hyponatremia]] (low blood [[sodium]] concentration) and [[dehydration]] in response to trauma/injury or the presence of tumors in or surrounding the [[brain]]. This form of hyponatraemia is due to excessive renal sodium excretion resulting from a centrally mediated process. 

The condition was initially described in 1950.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peters JP, Welt LG, Sims EA, Orloff J, Needham J |title=A salt-wasting syndrome associated with cerebral disease |journal=Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians |volume=63 |issue= |pages=57–64 |year=1950 |pmid=14855556 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Primary symptoms include [[polyuria]] (at least 2.5 liters in the course of 24 hours, for adults) due to inadequate sodium retention in the body, [[polydipsia]] (excessive thirst) due to polyuria, extreme [[salt]] cravings (e.g. desire to drink pickle juice), [[dysautonomia]], and [[dehydration]].  Patients often "self-medicate" by naturally gravitating toward a high-sodium diet and by dramatically increasing their water intake. Advanced symptoms include [[muscle cramps]], lightheadedness, dizziness or [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], feelings of anxiety or panic (not mentally induced), [[tachycardia]] (rapid heart rate) or [[bradycardia]] (slow heart rate), [[hypotension]] and [[orthostatic hypotension]] sometimes resulting in [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]].<ref name="isbn0-07-147247-9"/> Other symptoms frequently associated with dysautonomia include:  [[headaches]], [[pallor]], [[malaise]], facial flushing, [[constipation]] or [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[acid reflux]], visual disturbances, numbness, [[nerve]] pain, trouble breathing, chest pains, loss of consciousness and [[seizures]].<ref name="isbn0-07-147247-9">{{cite book |author=Tierney, Lawrence M.; McPhee, Stephen J.; Papadakis, Maxine A. |title=Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 2007 (Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year=2006 |pages=1010 |isbn=0-07-147247-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Causes and Diagnosis==
CSWS is usually caused by brain injury/trauma or cerebral lesion, tumor, or hematoma. CSWS is a diagnosis of exclusion and may be difficult to distinguish from the [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone]] (SIADH), which develops under similar circumstances and also presents with hyponatremia. The main clinical difference is that of total fluid status of the patient: CSWS leads to a relative or overt [[hypovolemia]] whereas SIADH is consistent with a normal to hypervolemic range.  Random urine sodium concentrations tend to be lower than 100 mEq/L in CSWS and greater in SIADH . If blood-sodium levels increase when fluids are restricted, SIADH is more likely.<ref name="pmid8747964">{{cite journal |author=Harrigan MR |title=Cerebral salt wasting syndrome: a review |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=152–60 |year=1996 |pmid=8747964 |doi=10.1097/00006123-199601000-00035}}</ref>

==Treatment==
While CSWS usually appears within the first week after brain injury and spontaneously resolves in 2–4 weeks, it can sometimes last for months or years. While fluid restriction is used to treat SIADH, CSWS requires aggressive hydration and correction of the low sodium levels using sodium chloride tablets. Sometimes, [[fludrocortisone]] (a [[mineralocorticoid]]) improves the hyponatremia.<ref name="pmid11836078">{{cite journal |author=Betjes MG |title=Hyponatremia in acute brain disease: the cerebral salt wasting syndrome |journal=Eur J Intern Med |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=9–14 |year=2002 |pmid=11836078 |doi= 10.1016/S0953-6205(01)00192-3|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0953620501001923}}</ref>
