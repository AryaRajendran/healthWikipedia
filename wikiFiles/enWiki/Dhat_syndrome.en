{{Infobox Disease |Name=Dhat syndrome |ICD10={{ICD10|F|48|8|f|40}}}}
'''Dhat syndrome''' is a condition that is found in the cultures of the [[Indian subcontinent]] in which male patients report symptoms of fatigue, weakness, anxiety, loss of appetite, guilt, sexual dysfunction, and suffering from [[premature ejaculation]] or [[impotence]], and believe that they are passing [[semen]] in their [[urine]]. The condition has no organic etiology.<ref>Mehte.V, Abhishek,D.,& Balachandran C. 2009. dhat syndrome:a reappraisal. Indian Journal of Dermatology,''54''(1):89-80. doi:10.403/0019-515449002.</ref>

In traditional [[Hindu]] spirituality, semen is described as a "vital fluid". The discharge of this "vital fluid", either through [[sex]] or [[masturbation]], is associated with marked feelings of [[anxiety]] and [[dysphoria]]. Often the patient describes the loss of a whitish fluid while passing urine. At other times, marked feelings of guilt associated with what the patient assumes is "excessive" [[masturbation]] are noted. 

This is based on an old Hindu belief that it takes forty drops of [[blood]] to create a drop of [[bone marrow]] and forty drops of bone marrow to create a drop of [[semen|sperm]].<ref>Drhubuajoti.(2008). Dhat syndrome. medicalgeek.com</ref>

Dhat is a folk diagnostic term used in India to refer to severe anxiety and hypochondriacal concerns associated with the discharge of semen, with discoloration of the urine, and feelings of weakness and exhaustion. This cultural bound syndrome is similar to jiryan (India), sukra prameha (Sri Lanka), and shen-k'uei (China).<ref>American Psychiatric Association. (2000).

==Symptoms==
Young males are most often affected, though similar symptoms have been reported in females with excessive vaginal discharge or [[leucorrhea]], which is also considered a "vital fluid". The males are usually  married or recently married and come from a low socioeconomic class. Also, the male's family is usually sexually conservative.<ref> http://www.readabstracts.com/Health/Dhat-syndrome-a-useful-diagnostic-entity-in-Indian-culture.html#ixzz2QHB1zpEa</ref>

Premature ejaculation and impotence are commonly seen. Other somatic symptoms like weakness, easy fatiguability, palpitations (unpleasant sensations of irregular and/or forceful beating of the heart), insomnia, low mood, guilt and anxiety are often present.<ref>Ranjith, G.

==History==
The term ‘Dhat’ gets its origin from the Sanskrit word ‘Dhatus’, which, according to the Susruta Samhita, means elixir that constitutes the body. It was first described in western psychiatric literature by Wig, with vague psychosomatic symptoms of fatigue, weakness, anxiety, loss of appetite, guilt and sexual dysfunction, attributed by the patient to loss of semen in nocturnal emission, through urine or masturbation.<ref>Wig N. Problems of mental health in India. J Clin Soc Psychiatry. 1960;17:48–53.</ref>Literature describing semen as a vital constituent of the human body dates back to 1500 BC. The disorders of ‘Dhatus’ have been elucidated in the Charak Samhita, which describes a disorder called ‘Shukrameha’ in which there is a passage of semen in the urine. In China, various names such as (Shen K'uei), Sri Lanka (Prameha) and other parts of South East Asia (Jiryan) symptoms and conditions are similar to 'Dhatus'. <ref>Mehte.V, Abhishek,D.,& Balachandran C. 2009. dhat syndrome:a reappraisal. Indian Journal of Dermatology,''54''(1):89-80. doi:10.403/0019-515449002.</ref>.The International Classification of diseases ICD-10 classifies Dhat syndrome as both a neurotic disorder (code F48.8)  and a culture specific disorder(Annexe 2) caused by ‘undue concern about the debilitating effects of the passage of semen.’ 


==Culture-bound syndrome?==
Some doctors believe dhat syndrome to be either a [[culture-bound syndrome|culture bound]] presentation of [[clinical depression]], as a [[somatization|somatized]] set of symptoms, or a result of Western doctors' misinterpretation of patients' descriptions of their condition.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sumathipala A, Siribaddana SH, Bhugra D |title=Culture-bound syndromes: the story of dhat syndrome |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=184 |issue= 3|pages=200–9 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=14990517 |doi= 10.1192/bjp.184.3.200 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/184/3/200.long}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dhikav V, Aggarwal N, Gupta S, Jadhavi R, Singh K |title=Depression in Dhat syndrome |journal=[[J Sex Med]] |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=841–4 |year=2008 |pmid=17451483 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00481.x}}</ref>

It is very common in Nepali culture as well. Most of them come with the complaints of "drops" and become extremely anxious about it and see it as loss of "male power". It is often related with obsessive ruminations and [[somatoform]] symptoms. Others see it as a distinct clinical entity, which is less culture-bound than these critics assert. They describe it as one form of a syndrome of "semen-loss anxiety" which also occurs in other Eastern cultures as [[jiryan]] and [[shen-k'uei]], as well as in Western cultures.

[[Chlamydia infection]] might also be related to the syndrome because of similar symptoms in the case of infection of the urethra (urethritis), which is usually symptomatic, causing a white discharge from the penis with or without pain on urinating (dysuria).

==Treatment==
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] is the mainstay of treatment. At other times counseling, anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications have been shown to be of use.<ref>Ruterbusch, K.
