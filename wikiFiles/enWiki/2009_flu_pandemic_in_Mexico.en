In March and April 2009, an [[outbreak]] of a new strain of [[influenza]] commonly referred to as "swine flu" infected many people in [[Mexico]] and other parts of the world, causing illness ranging from mild to severe. Initial reports suggested that the outbreak had started in February due to farming practices at a pig farm half-owned by [[Smithfield Foods]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/27/swine-flu-search-outbreak-source |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=April 27, 2009  | title=Four-year-old could hold key in search for source of swine flu outbreak | first1=Jo | last1=Tuckman | first2=Robert | last2=Booth| accessdate= 2 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090430094704/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/27/swine-flu-search-outbreak-source| archivedate= 30 April 2009| deadurl=no}}</ref>  Smithfield Foods stated that it had found no clinical signs or symptoms of the presence of swine influenza in the company's swine herd, or among its employees at its joint ventures in Mexico, that it routinely administers influenza virus vaccination to their swine herds and that it conducts monthly testing for the presence of swine influenza.<ref name=Smithfield090426>

<blockquote>
There was a lot of speculation and what seemed to be evidence there were dozens and dozens of deaths. Careful analysis showed these people likely died of something else, and not flu. That's really good news, and that would fit with what we've seen outside of Mexico.as of October 7,it is reported that more new cases of A/H1N1 were recorded in the month of September then in any other month-there were 9,231 new confirmed cases of A/H1N1 influenza in Mexico in September. It is important to remember that that number represents only confirmed cases-far more people were in infected with A/H1N1 influenza,became only mildly ill,and recovered without seeing a doctor,and thus never had their cases confirmed or counted. Widespread closures of schools are unlikely,however,as it is known that the virus has a low mortality rate."we know that the situation is not a serious as officials feared last spring" said health secretary Jose Angel Cordava.

Both the [[World Health Organization]] and the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] have praised the response by the Mexican government, calling it "a model of rapid and transparent reporting, aggressive control measures, and generous sharing of data and samples" in addition to labeling it "courageous and impressive".<ref>

After a month since the first atypical pneumonia cases were detected, the Mexican government responded and established some measures in Mexico City, the State of Mexico and the State of San Luis Potosí, where the swine flu had spread, to decrease the risk of more infections. Hundreds of soldiers and police officers mobilized by the government have handed out six million [[surgical masks]] to citizens in and around [[Mexico City]].<ref name="ap_race">{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com |title= US declares health emergency as world officials race to contain worrisome swine flu, panic |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |date=April 26, 2009 |author=Neergaard, Lauran}}</ref>
