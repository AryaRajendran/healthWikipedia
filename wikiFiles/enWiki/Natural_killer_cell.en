'''Natural killer cells''' (or '''NK cells''') are a type of [[cytotoxic]] [[lymphocyte]] critical to the [[innate immune system]].  The role NK cells play is analogous to that of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s in the vertebrate [[adaptive immune response]]. NK cells provide rapid responses to virally infected cells and respond to [[tumor]] formation, acting at around 3 days after [[infection]].  Typically [[immune cells]] detect [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] presented on infected cell surfaces, triggering [[cytokine]] release causing [[lysis]] or [[apoptosis]]. [[NK cells]] are unique, however, as they have the ability to  recognize  stressed cells in the absence of [[antibodies]] and MHC, allowing for a much faster immune reaction.  They were named “natural killers” because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are missing “self” markers of [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) class 1.<ref name=Vivier2011>{{Cite journal | author=Vivier, E., Raulet, D.H., Moretta, A., Caligiuri, M.A., Zitvogel, L., Lanier, L.L., Yokoyama, W.M. & Ugolini, S. | title=Innate or Adaptive Immunity?

NK cells are defined as large granular lymphocytes (LGL) and constitute the third kind of cells differentiated from the common [[lymphoblast|lymphoid progenitor]] generating [[B cell|B]] and [[T cell|T lymphocyte]]s.<ref name=Roitt>Roitt I, Brostoff J, Male D (2001).

In contrast to NKT cells, NK cells do not express [[T-cell antigen receptors]] (TCR) or Pan T marker [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] or surface [[immunoglobulin]]s (Ig) [[B cell receptor]]s, but they usually express the surface markers [[CD16]] (FcγRIII) and [[CD56]] in humans, NK1.1 or NK1.2 in [[C57BL/6]] [[mouse|mice]]. Up to 80% of human NK cells also express [[CD8]].

In addition to the knowledge that natural killer cells are effectors of [[innate immunity]], recent research has uncovered information on both activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors which play important function roles including self tolerance and sustaining NK cell activity.  NK cell also play a role in [[adaptive immune response]],<ref name=Arina2007>{{Cite journal | author=Arina, A., Murillo, O., Dubrot, J., Azpilikueta, A., Alfaro, C., PÃrez-Gracia, J.,L., Bendandi, M., Palencia, B., HervÃ¡s-Stubbs, S. & Melero, I. | title='Cellular liaisons of natural killer lymphocytes in immunology and immunotherapy of cancer'| journal=[[Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy]] | volume=5 | year=2007 | pages=599–615 | doi=10.1517/14712598.7.5.599}}</ref> numerous experiments have worked to demonstrate their ability to readily adjust to the immediate environment and formulate antigen-specific [[immunological memory]], fundamental for responding to secondary infections with the same antigen.  The ability for NK cells to act in both the innate and adaptive immune response is becoming increasingly important in research utilizing NK cell activity and potential cancer therapies.

==NK cell receptors==
[[File:HLA-Cw4.png|150px|right|thumb|The HLA ligand for KIR]]

NK cell receptors can also be differentiated based on function. Natural [[cytotoxicity]] receptors directly induce [[apoptosis]] after binding to [[ligands]] that directly indicate infection of a cell. The MHC dependent receptors (described above) use an alternate pathway to induce apoptosis in infected cells. Natural killer cell activation is determined by the balance of inhibitory and activating receptor stimulation i.e. if the inhibitory receptor signaling is more prominent then NK cell activity will be inhibited, similarly if the activating signal is dominant then NK cell activation will result.<ref name=Terunuma2008>{{Cite journal | author=Terunuma, H., Deng, X., Dewan, Z., Fujimoto, S., Yamamoto, N.| title=Potential role of NK cells in the induction of immune responses: implications for NK cell-based immunotherapy for cancers and viral infections| journal=[[International Reviews of Immunology]] | volume=27 | year=2008 | pages=93–110 | doi=10.1080/08830180801911743}}</ref>

NK cell receptor types (with inhibitory as well as some activating members) are differentiated by structure, with a couple of examples to follow:
[[File:PDB 1hkf EBI.jpg|150px|thumb|Protein Structure of NKp44]]

===Activating receptors===
*'''[[Ly49]] '''(homodimers) — a relatively ancient, C-type lectin family receptor; are of multigenic presence in mice, while humans have only one [[pseudogene|pseudogenic]] Ly49; the receptor for classical (polymorphic) [[MHC I]] molecules.
*'''NCR''' (natural cytotoxicity receptors), upon stimulation, mediate NK killing and release of IFNϒ.
*'''[[CD94]] : [[NKG2]]''' (heterodimers) — a C-type lectin family receptor, conserved in both rodents and primates and identifies non-classical (also non-polymorphic) MHC I molecules like  [[HLA-E]]. Expression of HLA-E at the cell surface is dependent on the presence of nonamer peptide epitope derived from the signal sequence of classical MHC class I molecules, which is generated by the sequential action of [[signal peptide peptidase]] and the [[proteasome]]. Though indirect, this is a way to survey the levels of classical (polymorphic) HLA molecules.
*'''[[CD16]] ([[CD16|Fc&gamma;IIIA]])''' play a role in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ([[Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity|ADCC]]), in particular they bind [[IgG]].

==Function==

===Cytolytic granule mediated cell apoptosis===
NK cells are [[cytotoxic]]; small [[Granulocytes|granules]] in their [[cytoplasm]] contain proteins such as [[perforin]] and [[protease]]s known as [[granzyme]]s. Upon release in close proximity to a cell slated for killing, perforin forms pores in the [[cell membrane]] of the target cell, creating an aqueous channel through which the granzymes and associated molecules can enter, inducing either [[apoptosis]] or osmotic cell lysis. The distinction between apoptosis and cell [[lysis]] is important in [[immunology]]: lysing a virus-infected cell could potentially only release the [[virion]]s, whereas apoptosis leads to destruction of the virus inside. [[Alpha defensin|&alpha;defensins]], an antimicrobial is also secreted by NK cells, it directly kills bacteria by disrupting their cell walls analogous to [[neutrophil]]s.<ref name=Lannello2008/>

===Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)===
Infected cells are routinely opsonised with antibodies for detection by immune cells.  Antibodies that bind to antigens can be recognised by FcϒRIII ([[CD16]]) receptors expressed on NK cells resulting in NK activation, release of cytolytic granules and consequent cell apoptosis. This is a major mechanism of killing for some monoclonal antibodies like rituximab (Rituxan), ofatumumab (Azzera) and others. The contribution of ADCC to tumor cell killing can be measured with a specific test that uses NK-92 [[NK-92]] that has been transfected with a high affinity FcR. Results are compared to the "wild type" NK-92 [[NK-92]] that does not express the FcR (www.nk-92.com) [[NK-92]].<ref name=Smyth2002>{{Cite journal | author=Smyth, M.J., Hayakawa, Y., Takeda, K., Yagita. | title=New aspects of natural-killer-cell surveillance and therapy of cancer | journal=[[Nature Review]] | volume=2 | year=2002 | pages=850–852 | doi=10.1038/nrg928}}</ref>

===Cytokine induced NK and CTL activation===
[[Cytokine]]s play a crucial role in NK cell activation. As these are [[Stress (biology)|stress]] molecules released by cells upon viral infection, they serve to signal to the NK cell the presence of [[virus|viral pathogens]]. Cytokines involved in NK activation include IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-2, and CCL5. NK cells are activated in response to interferons or macrophage-derived cytokines. They serve to contain viral infections while the adaptive immune response is generating antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells that can clear the infection. NK cells work to control viral infections by secreting IFNγ and TNFα, IFNγ activates macrophages for phagocytosis and lysis and TNFα acts promote direct NK tumor cells killing.  Patients deficient in NK cells prove to be highly susceptible to early phases of herpes virus infection.

===Missing 'self' hypothesis===
[[Image:Missingself.svg|thumb|right|400px| Schematic diagram indicating the complementary activities of [[cytotoxic T-cells]] and NK cells.]]
In order for NK cells to defend the body against [[viruses]] and other [[pathogens]], they require mechanisms that enable the determination of whether a cell is infected or not. The exact mechanisms remain the subject of current investigation, but recognition of an "altered self" state is thought to be involved. To control their cytotoxic activity, NK cells possess two types of surface  [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s:  ''activating receptors'' and ''inhibitory receptors''. Most of these receptors are not unique to NK cells and can be present in some [[T cell]] subsets as well.

These inhibitory receptors recognize [[MHC class I]] [[allele]]s, which could explain why NK cells kill cells possessing low levels of MHC class I molecules. This inhibition is crucial to the role played by NK cells. MHC class I molecules are the main mechanism by which cells display viral or tumor antigens to cytotoxic T-cells. A common evolutionary adaptation to this seen in both intracellular [[microbes]] and tumours, the chronic down-regulation of MHC I molecules, rendering the cell impervious to T-cell mediated immunity. It is believed that NK cells, evolved as an evolutionary response to this adaptation (the loss of the MHC deprives CD4/CD8 action so another immune cell evolved to fulfil the requirement).
.<ref name=Lodoen>{{Cite_journal| author=Lodoen, M.,B. & Lanier, L.,L.| title=Viral modulation of NK cell immunity | journal=[[Nature Reviews Microbiology]] | volume=3 | year=2005 | pages=59–69| doi=10.1038/nrmicro1066}}</ref>

===Tumor cell surveillance===
Natural Killer Cells (NK) often lack antigen specific cell surface receptors and therefore are part of innate immunity i.e. able to react immediately with no prior exposure to the pathogen.  In both mice and humans NKs can be seen to play a role in tumor immuno-surveillance by directly inducing the death of tumor cells (NKs act as cytolytic effector lymphocytes) even with the absence of surface adhesion molecules and antigenic peptides, this role of NK cells is critical for immune success particularly because T cells are unable to recognize pathogens in the absence of surface antigens.<ref name=Vivier2011/>  Tumor cell detection results in activation of NK cells and consequent cytokine production and release.

If the tumor cells do not cause inflammation they will also be regarded as self and therefore will not induce a T cell response. A number of cytokines are produced by NKs including Tumor Necrosis Factor α ([[TNF&alpha;]]), [[IFN&gamma;]] and [[Interleukin]] ([[Interleukin 10|IL-10]]); TNFα and IL-10 act as pro-inflammatory and immuno-suppressors respectively. The activation of NK cells and subsequent production of cytolytic effector cells impacts [[macrophages]], [[dendritic cells]] and [[neutrophils]] which subsequently affects antigen specific T and B cell responses.
Instead of acting via antigen specific receptors, lysis of tumor cells by NK cells is mediated by alternative receptors including [[NKG2D]], NKp44, NKp46, NKp30 and DNAM.<ref name=Terunuma2008/> [[NKG2D]] is a [[disulfide bond|disulfide]]-linked [[homodimer]] which recognizes a number of ligands, including ULBP and [[MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A|MICA]], which are typically expressed on tumor cells.

NK cells, along with [[macrophage]]s and several other cell types, express the Fc receptor (FcR) molecule (FC-gamma-RIII = CD16), an activating biochemical [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] that binds the [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fc]] portion of [[Antibody|antibodies]]. This allows NK cells to target cells against which a [[Humoral immunity|humoral response]] has been mobilized and to [[lysis|lyse]] cells through [[Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity|Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)]]. This response depends on the affinity of the Fc receptor expressed on NK cells which can have high, intermediate and low affinity for the Fc portion of the antibody or IgG. This affinity is determined by the nucleotide status in position 158 of the gene. which can code of  Phenylalanine (F allele) or Valine (V allele). Individuals with high affinity FcRgammRIII (158 V/V allele) respond better to antibody therapy. This has been shown for lymphoma patients who received the antibody Rituxan. Patients who express the 158 V/V allele had a better anti-tumor response. Only 15-25% of the population expressed the 158 V/V allele. To determine the ADCC contribution of monoclonal antibodies, NK-92 cells (a "pure" NK cell line) [[NK-92]] has been transfected with the gene for the high affinity expressing FcR.

===NK cell function in adaptive response===
The ability to generate memory cells following a primary infection and the consequent rapid immune activation and response to succeeding infections by the same antigen is fundamental to the role T and B cells play in the adaptive immune response.  Despite prior belief that NK cells play no role in the adaptive immune responses, they have since been found to undergo expansion, contraction, memory maintenance and recall.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Pyzik, M. & Vidal, S.,M.| title='NK cells stroll down the memory lane' | journal=[[Immunology and Cell Biology]] | volume=87 | year=2009 | pages=261–263| doi=10.1038/icb.2009.10 | issue=4}}</ref>

===NK cell function in pregnancy===
As the majority of pregnancies involve two parents who are not tissue matched, successful [[pregnancy]] requires the mother's immune system to be [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|suppressed]]. NK cells are thought to be an important cell type in this process.<ref name="pmid20061017">{{cite journal |author=Lash, G, Robson, S, Bulmer, J. |title=Review: Functional role of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells in human early pregnancy decidua |journal=Placenta |volume=31 |issue=S |pages=87–92 |year=2010 |pmid=20061017 |doi=10.1016/j.placenta.2009.12.022}}</ref> These cells are known as "uterine NK cells" (uNK cells) and they differ from peripheral NK cells. They are in the [[CD56|CD56<sup>bright</sup>]] NK cell subset, potent at cytokine secretion, but with low cytotoxic ability and relatively similar to peripheral CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells, with a slightly different receptor profile.<ref name="pmid20061017" /> These uNK cells are the most abundant [[leukocyte]]s present in the uterus in early pregnancy, representing approximately 70% of leukocytes here, however where they originate from remains controversial.<ref name="pmid19876837">{{cite journal |author=Bulmer, J, Williams, P, Lash, G |title=Immune cells in the placental bed |journal=Int J Dev Biol |volume=54 |pages=281–294 |year=2010 |pmid=19876837 |doi=10.1387/ijdb.082763jb}}</ref>

These NK cells have been shown to have the ability to elicit cell cytotoxicity ''in vitro'', however at a lower level than peripheral NK cells, despite containing [[perforin]].<ref name="PMCid1266146">{{cite journal |author= Kopcow, H ''et al.'' |title=Human decidual NK cells form immature activating synapses and are not cytotoxic |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA| volume=102 | pages=15563–15568 |year=2005 |pmc=1266146 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0507835102 |pmid=16230631}}</ref> Lack of cytotoxicity ''in vivo'' may be due to the presence of ligands for their inhibitory receptors. [[Trophoblast]] cells downregulate [[HLA-A]] and [[HLA-B]] in order to defend against [[cytotoxic T cell]]-mediated death. This would normally trigger NK cells by ''missing self recognition'', however these cells survive. It is thought that the selective retention of [[HLA-E]] (which is a ligand for NK cell inhibitory receptor NKG2A) and [[HLA-G]] (which is a ligand for NK cell inhibitory receptor [[KIR2DL4]]) by the trophoblast defends it against NK cell-mediated death.<ref name="pmid20061017" />

NK cells secrete a high level of [[cytokine]]s which help mediate their function. Some important cytokines they secrete include [[TNF-α]], [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]], [[IFN-γ]] and [[TGF-β]], among others.<ref name="pmid20061017" /> For example, IFN-γ dilates and thins the walls of maternal spiral arteries to enhance blood flow to the implantation site.<ref>Ashkar AA, Di Santo JP, Croy BA. Interferon gamma contributes to initiation of uterine vascular modification, decidual integrity, and uterine natural killer cell maturation during normal murine pregnancy. J Exp Med. 2000 Jul 17;192(2):259-70.</ref>

===NK cell evasion by tumor cells===
By shedding decoy NKG2D soluble ligands tumor cells have evolved a process by which they are able to avoid immune responses.  These soluble NKG2D ligands bind to NK cell NKG2D receptors activating a false NK response and consequently creating competition for the receptor site.<ref name=Vivier2011/>  This method of evasion occurs in [[prostate cancer]].  In addition, prostate cancer tumors can evade CD8 cell recognition due to the ability to lose expression of MHC class 1 molecules. This example of immune evasion actually highlights NK cell importance in tumor surveillance and response as CD8 cells can consequently only act on tumor cells in response to NK initiated cytokine production (adaptive immune response).<ref>{{Cite journal | author= O'Leary, J.,G., Goodarzi, M., Drayton, D.,L. & von Andrian, U.,H.| title='T cell-and B cell-independent adaptive immunity mediated by natural killer cells'| journal=[[Nature Immunology]] | volume=7 | year=2006 | pages=507–516 | doi=10.1038/ni1332 }}</ref>

==History==
In early experiments on cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor target cells, both in cancer patients and animal models, investigators consistently observed what was termed a "natural" reactivity, that is, a certain population of cells seemed to be able to [[lysis|lyse]] [[tumor cell]]s without having been previously sensitized to them. As these discoveries were incompatible with the established model at the time, many initially considered that these observations were artifacts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oldham R |title=Natural killer cells: Artifact to reality: An odyssey in biology |journal=Cancer Metastasis Reviews |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=323–36 |year=1983 |pmid=6375859 |doi=10.1007/BF00048565}}</ref> However, by 1973, 'natural killing' activity was established across a wide variety of species, and the existence of a separate lineage of cells possessing this ability was postulated.

The discovery that a unique type of lymphocyte was responsible for “natural” or spontaneous cytotoxicity was made in the early 1970s by doctoral student Rolf Kiessling and post-doctoral fellow Hugh Pross, in the mouse,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kiessling R., Klein E., Pross H., Wigzell H. | year = 1975 | title = Natural" killer cells in the mouse.

Cancer | pages=596–605}}</ref>  The mouse and human work was carried out under the supervision of professors Eva Klein and Hans Wigzell, respectively, of the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm. Kiessling’s research involved the well-characterized ability of [[T-lymphocytes]] to [[lysis|lyse]] tumor cells against which they had been previously immunized. Pross and Jondal were studying cell-mediated cytotoxicity in normal human blood and the effect of the removal of various receptor-bearing cells on this cytotoxicity. Later that same year Ronald Herberman published similar data with respect to the unique nature of the mouse effector cell.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 1080480 | volume=16 | issue=2 | title=Natural cytotoxic reactivity of mouse lymphoid cells against syngeneic and allogeneic tumors. II. Characterization of effector cells | year=1975 | month=August | author=Herberman RB, Nunn ME, Holden HT, Lavrin DH | journal=Int. J. Cancer | pages=230–9}}</ref>
The human data were confirmed, for the most part, by West et al.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 29976 | volume=42 | issue=4 | title=Cardiovascular effects of isoproterenol and possible antagonistic actions of propranolol and perhexiline | year=1978 | month=April | author=Matsukawa H, Okabe E, Sakamoto H, Cho YW, Ito H | journal=Jpn. Circ. J. | pages=425–32}}</ref>  using similar techniques and the same erythroleukemic target cell line, K562. K562 is highly sensitive to lysis by human NK cells and, over the decades, the K562  <sup>51</sup>Chromium-release assay has become the most commonly used assay to detect human NK functional activity.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7334070 | volume=1 | issue=1 | title=Spontaneous human lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor target cells.

Immunol. | pages=51–63}}</ref>  Its almost universal use has meant that experimental data can be compared easily by different laboratories around the world.

Using  discontinuous density centrifugation and, later,  [[monoclonal antibodies]], ''natural killing'' ability was mapped to the subset of large, granular lymphocytes known today as NK cells. The demonstration that density gradient-isolated large granular lymphocytes were responsible for human NK activity, made by Timonen and Saksela in 1980,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7430655 | volume=36 | issue=3-4 | title=Isolation of human NK cells by density gradient centrifugation | year=1980 | author=Timonen T, Saksela E | journal=J. Immunol. Methods | pages=285–91}}</ref> was the first time that NK cells had been visualized microscopically and was a major breakthrough in the field.

==New findings==

===Anti-cancer therapy===

Since NK cells recognize target cells when they express non-self HLA antigens (but not self), autologous (patients' own) NK cell infusions have not shown any anti-tumor effects. Instead investigators are working on using allogeneic cells from peripheral blood which requires that the T-cells are removed before infusion into the patients as they would otherwise cause graft versus host disease (GvHD) which can be fatal. This can be achieved using an immunomagnetic column (CliniMACS). In addition, because of the limited number of NK cells in blood (only 10% of lymphocytes are NK-cells) their number needs to be expanded in culture. This can take a few weeks and the yield is donor dependent. A simpler way to achieve high numbers of pure NK cells is to expand NK-92 cells [[NK-92]] whose cells continuously grow in culture and can be expanded to clinical grade numbers in bags or bioreactors.<ref>Gong J, Maki G, Klingemann H. Characterization of a human cell line (NK-92) with phenotypical and functional characteristics of activated natural killer cells. Leukemia 1994; 8: 652-58</ref> Clinical studies have shown that it is well tolerated and some anti-tumor responses have been seen in patients with lung cancer, melanoma and lymphoma.<ref>Arai S, Meagher R, Swearingen M, et al. Infusion of the allogeneic cell line NK-92 in patients with advanced renal cell cancer or melanoma: a phase I trial. Cytotherapy 2008;10:625-32</ref><ref>Tonn T, Becker S, Esser R, Schwabe D, Seifried E. Cellular immunotherapy of malignancies using the clonal natural killer cell line NK-92. J Hematother Stem Cell Res 2001;10:535-44.</ref>

Recent studies at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and UPenn have shown that infusions of T-cells that were engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognizing an antigen molecule on leukemia cells could induce remissions in patients with advanced leukemia. There are logistical challenges of expanding T-cells and investigators are working on applying the same technology to peripheral blood NK cells and NK-92 [[NK-92]].

NK cells in a study at Children's Hospital Boston in coordination with [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]], whereby immunocompromised mice had contracted [[lymphomas]] from [[Epstein-Barr virus|EBV]] infection, an NK activating receptor called [[NKG2D]] was fused with a stimulatory [[Fc region|Fc]] portion of the EBV antibody.  The NKG2D-Fc fusion proved capable of reducing tumor growth and prolonging survival of the recipients.  In a transplantation model of LMP1-fueled lymphomas, the NKG2D-Fc fusion proved quite capable of reducing tumor growth and prolonging survival of the recipients.

===Innate resistance to HIV?===
Recent research suggests that specific KIR-MHC class 1 gene interactions could control innate genetic resistance to certain viral infections including [[HIV]] and its consequent development of [[AIDS]].<ref name=Lannello2008/> Certain HLA allotypes have been found to determine the progression of HIV to AIDS; an example is the [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA-B57]] and HLA-B27 alleles, which have been found to defer progression of HIV to AIDS. This is evident because patients expressing these HLA alleles are observed to have lower viral loads and a more gradual decline in [[T helper cell|CD4<sup>+</sup> T]] cells numbers.  Despite considerable research and data collected measuring the genetic correlation of HLA alleles and KIR allotypes, a firm conclusion has not yet been drawn as to what combination provides decrease HIV and AIDS susceptibility.  Future research would aim to pinpoint relevant KIR/HLA interactions with aim to produce a vaccine against HIV/AIDS.

NK cells can impose immune pressure on HIV, something that had previously been described only for T cells and antibodies <ref name="sd">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110803133509.htm</ref> and that HIV mutates to avoid NK cell activity.<ref name="sd"/>
