'''Chickenpox''' (or '''chicken pox''') is a highly [[Infectious disease|contagious]] disease caused by primary [[infection]] with [[varicella zoster virus]] (VZV).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wood MJ |title=History of Varicella Zoster Virus |journal=Herpes |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=60–65 |year=2000 |month=October |pmid=11867004 }}</ref> It usually starts with  [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicular]] skin [[rash]] mainly on the body and head rather than at the periphery and becomes itchy, raw [[Acne scarring|pockmarks]], which mostly heal without scarring. On examination, the observer typically finds lesions at various stages of healing.

Chickenpox is an [[airborne disease]] spread easily through coughing or sneezing of ill individuals or through direct contact with secretions from the rash.  A person with chickenpox is infectious one to two days before the rash appears.<ref name="rashes">{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001592|Chickenpox}}</ref> They remain contagious until all lesions have crusted over (this takes approximately six days).<ref>[http://uhs.berkeley.edu/home/healthtopics/chickenpox.shtml UHS Tang Center<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Immunocompromised patients are [[contagious disease|contagious]] during the entire period as new lesions keep appearing.

There are several theories regarding the origin of the term ''chicken pox''. It is often stated to be a modification of ''[[chickpea]]s'' (based on resemblance of the vesicles to chickpeas),<ref name="Belse">{{cite book |author=Belshe, Robert B. |title=Textbook of human virology |publisher=PSG |location=Littleton MA |year=1984 |isbn=0-88416-458-6 |page=829 |edition=2nd}}</ref><ref name="Shors">{{cite book |author=Teri Shors |chapter=Herpesviruses: Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) |title=Understanding Viruses |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Uk8xP5LRHr4C&pg=PA459 |year=2011 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett |isbn=978-0-7637-8553-6 |page=459 |edition=2nd}}</ref> or due to the rash resembling chicken pecks.<ref name="Shors"/> Other theories include the designation ''chicken'' for a child (i.e., literally 'child pox') or a corruption of ''itching-pox''.<ref name="Belse"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Pattison, John; Zuckerman, Arie J.; Banatvala, J.E. |title=Principles and practice of clinical virology |publisher=Wiley |year=1994 |page=37 |isbn=0-471-93106-3 |edition=3rd }}</ref> [[Samuel Johnson]] explained the designation as "from its being of no very great danger."<ref>{{cite book |author=Johnson, Samuel |title=Dictionary of the English language |publisher=Williamson |location=London |year=1839 |page=195 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The early ([[Prodrome|prodromal]]) symptoms in adolescents and adults are nausea, loss of appetite, aching muscles, and headache. This is followed by the characteristic rash, [[malaise]] and a low-grade fever that signal the presence of the disease. In children the illness is not usually preceded by prodromal symptoms and the first sign is the rash. The rash begins as small red dots on the face, scalp, torso and upper arms and legs; progressing over 10–12 hours to small bumps, blisters and [[Cutaneous condition#Pustule|pustules]]; followed by [[Cutaneous_condition#Umbilication|umbilication]] and the formation of scabs.<ref name = Medscape>{{ cite web | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1131785 | title = Chickenpox Clinical Presentation | author = Anthony J Papadopoulos | editor = Dirk M Elston | accessdate = 4 August 2012 | work = Medscape Reference }}</ref><ref name="Symptoms of Chickenpox">{{cite web|title=Symptoms of Chickenpox|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Chickenpox/Pages/Symptoms.aspx|work=Chickenpox|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref> 

At the blister stage intense itch is usually present. Blisters may also occur on the palms, soles and [[mucous membrane]]s, and painful, shallow ulcers may appear in the mouth, the top of the throat and the genital area. These symptoms appear from 10 to 21 days after infection, and the infected person is typically infectious from one to two days prior to the appearance of the rash and remains infectious until four or five days after its appearance. Adults may have a more widespread rash, and longer fever; and are more likely to experience complications, such as varicella pneumonia.<ref name="Medscape"/>

Chickenpox is rarely fatal, although it is generally more severe in adult males than in adult females or children. Non-immune pregnant women and those with a suppressed immune system are at highest risk of serious complications. Chickenpox is believed to be the cause of one third of stroke cases in children.<ref name=Askalan>{{cite journal |author=Askalan R, Laughlin S, Mayank S, ''et al.'' |title=Chickenpox and stroke in childhood: a study of frequency and causation |journal=Stroke |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=1257–62 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11387484 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.32.6.1257 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/32/6/1257}}</ref> The most common late complication of chickenpox is [[herpes zoster|shingles]] (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the ''varicella zoster'' virus decades after the initial episode of chickenpox.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of varicella is primarily clinical, with typical early "[[prodrome|prodromal]]" symptoms, and then the characteristic [[rash]]. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be sought through either examination of the fluid within the vesicles of the [[rash]], or by testing blood for evidence of an acute immunologic response.

Vesicular fluid can be examined with a [[Tzanck test|Tzanck smear]], or better with examination for [[direct fluorescent antibody]]. The fluid can also be "cultured", whereby attempts are made to grow the virus from a fluid sample. Blood tests can be used to identify a response to acute infection (IgM) or previous infection and subsequent immunity (IgG).<ref>{{cite book |author=Pincus, Matthew R.; McPherson, Richard A.; Henry, John Bernard |title=Henry's clinical diagnosis and management by laboratory methods |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |year=2007 |isbn=1-4160-0287-1 |edition=21st |chapter=Ch. 54}}</ref>

Prenatal diagnosis of fetal varicella infection can be performed using [[ultrasound]], though a delay of 5 weeks following primary maternal infection is advised. A [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] (DNA) test of the mother's [[amniotic fluid]] can also be performed, though the risk of [[spontaneous abortion]] due to the [[amniocentesis]] procedure is higher than the risk of the baby developing fetal varicella syndrome.<ref name="pregnancy"/>

==Epidemiology==
Primary varicella is a disease that is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to all countries worldwide. Varicella has a prevalence that is stable from generation to generation.<ref name=pmid11289797>{{cite journal

In [[temperate zone|temperate]] countries, chickenpox is primarily a disease of children, with most cases occurring during the winter and spring, most likely due to school contact. It is one of the classic diseases of childhood, with the highest prevalence in the 4–10 year old age group. Like [[rubella]], it is uncommon in preschool children. Varicella is highly communicable, with an infection rate of 90% in close contacts. In temperate countries, most people become infected before adulthood but 10% of young adults remain susceptible.

In the tropics, chickenpox often occurs in older people and may cause more serious disease.<ref name=pmid8856352>{{cite journal |journal= Infect Dis Clin North Am |year=1996 |volume=10 |issue= 3 |pages=571–81 |title= The epidemiology of varicella-zoster virus infections |author= Wharton M |pmid=8856352 |doi= 10.1016/S0891-5520(05)70313-5}}</ref> In adults the pock marks are darker and the scars more prominent than in children.<ref name="EpidemiologyURL">{{cite web

Exposure to VZV in a healthy child initiates the production of host [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), [[immunoglobulin M]] (IgM), and [[immunoglobulin A]] (IgA) [[Antibody|antibodies]]; IgG antibodies persist for life and confer immunity. [[Cell-mediated immunity|Cell-mediated immune responses]] are also important in limiting the scope and the duration of primary varicella infection. After primary infection, VZV is hypothesized to spread from [[mucosa]]l and [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] lesions to local [[sensory nerve]]s. VZV then remains latent in the [[Dorsal root ganglion|dorsal ganglion]] cells of the sensory nerves. Reactivation of VZV results in the clinically distinct syndrome of [[herpes zoster]] (i.e., ''shingles''), [[postherpetic neuralgia]], and sometimes [[Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II]].  {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Varicella infection in pregnant women could lead to [[virus|viral]] [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] via the placenta and infection of the fetus. If infection occurs during the first 28 weeks of [[gestation]], this can lead to fetal varicella syndrome (also known as ''congenital varicella syndrome'').<ref name="pmid17845179">{{cite journal |author=Boussault P, Boralevi F, Labbe L, Sarlangue J, Taïeb A, Leaute-Labreze C |title=Chronic varicella-zoster skin infection complicating the congenital varicella syndrome |journal=Pediatr Dermatol |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=429–32 |year=2007 |pmid=17845179 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1470.2007.00471.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0736-8046&date=2007&volume=24&issue=4&spage=429}}</ref> Effects on the fetus can range in severity from underdeveloped toes and fingers to severe anal and bladder malformation.

The risk of the baby developing the disease is greatest following exposure to infection in the period 7 days  prior to delivery and up to 7 days following the birth.

Newborns who develop symptoms are at a high risk of [[pneumonia]] and other serious complications of the disease.<ref name="pregnancy">{{cite web | author=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists | title=Chickenpox in Pregnancy | url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/GT13ChickenpoxinPregnancy2007.pdf |format=PDF| month=September | year=2007 | accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref>

===Shingles===
{{Main|Herpes zoster}}
After a chickenpox infection, the virus remains dormant in the body's nerve tissues. The [[immune system]] keeps the virus at bay, but later in life, usually as an adult, it can be reactivated and cause a different form of the viral infection called [[herpes zoster|shingles]] (scientifically known as '''herpes zoster''').<ref>{{cite web |title=Chickenpox |date=19 April 2012 |work=NHS Choices |publisher=UK Department of Health |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chickenpox/Pages/Introduction.aspx}}</ref>
The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) suggests that any adult over the age of 60 years gets the herpes zoster vaccine as a part of their normal medical check ups. 

Many adults who have had chickenpox as children are susceptible to shingles as adults, often with the accompanying condition [[postherpetic neuralgia]], a painful condition that makes it difficult to sleep. Even after the shingles rash has gone away, there can be night pain in the area affected by the rash.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shingles & Chickenpox: What's the Link?|url=http://www.webmd.com/vaccines/features/shingles-chickenpox|publisher=WebMD}}</ref>

Shingles affects one in five adults infected with chickenpox as children, especially those who are immune  suppressed, particularly from cancer, HIV, or other conditions. However, stress can bring on shingles as well, although scientists are still researching the connection.<ref name="webmd2">{{cite web|title=An Overview of Shingles|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/shingles/shingles-skin|publisher=WebMD}}</ref>

Shingles are most commonly found in adults over the age of 60 who were diagnosed with chickenpox when they were under the age of 1. When the immune system is very low in some cases the virus that was in your system when you were young can come back in the form of shingles <ref>{{cite web|title=Shingles|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001861/|publisher=PubMed Health}}</ref>

A shingles vaccine is available for adults over 50 who have had childhood chickenpox or who have previously had shingles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shingles Vaccine|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/shingles/shingles-vaccine|publisher=WebMD}}</ref>

The vaccine for shingles lessens the impact of shingles and its side effects.

==Prevention==

===Hygiene measures===
The spread of chickenpox can be prevented by isolating affected individuals. Contagion is by exposure to respiratory droplets, or direct contact with lesions, within a period lasting from three days prior to the onset of the rash, to four days after the onset of the rash.<ref>{{cite book |author=Murray, Patrick R.; Rosenthal, Ken S.; Pfaller, Michael A. |title=Medical Microbiology |publisher=Elsevier Mosby |year=2005 |isbn=0-323-03303-2 |page=551 |edition=5th}},  edition'' (Elsevier), p..</ref>  The chickenpox virus ([[VZV]]) is susceptible to disinfectants, notably [[bleach|chlorine bleach]] (i.e., [[sodium hypochlorite]]).  Also, like all [[viral envelope|enveloped viruses]], VZV is sensitive to desiccation, heat and detergents.  Therefore these viruses are relatively easy to kill in the environment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Vaccine===
{{Main|Varicella vaccine}}
A [[varicella vaccine]] was first developed by Michiaki Takahashi in 1974 derived from the Oka strain. It has been available in the US since 1995 to inoculate against the disease.  Some countries require the varicella vaccination or an exemption before entering elementary school.  Protection from one dose is not lifelong and a second dose is necessary five years after the initial immunization,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Chaves SS, Gargiullo P, Zhang JX, ''et al.'' | title=Loss of vaccine-induced immunity to varicella over time | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2007 | volume=356 | issue=11 | pages=1121–9 | pmid=17360990 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa064040}}</ref> which is currently part of the routine immunization schedule in the US.<ref>{{cite web |title=Child, Adolescent & "Catch-up" Immunization Schedules |work=Immunization Schedules |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/child-adolescent.html}}</ref> The chickenpox vaccine is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule in the UK. In the UK, the vaccine is currently only offered to people who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox. A vaccinated person is likely to have a milder case of chickenpox if infected.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chickenpox (varicella) vaccination |date=19 April 2012 |work=NHS Choices |publisher=UK Department of Health |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/varicella-vaccine/pages/introduction.aspx}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Varicella treatment mainly consists of easing the symptoms as there is no actual [[cure]] of the condition. Some treatments  are however available for relieving the symptoms while the [[immune system]] clears the virus from the [[body]]. As a protective measure, patients are usually required to stay at home while they are infectious to avoid spreading the disease to others. Also, sufferers are frequently asked to cut their [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] short or to wear [[gloves]] to prevent scratching and to minimize the risk of secondary [[infections]].

The condition resolves by itself within a couple of weeks but meanwhile patients must pay attention to their personal [[hygiene]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/chickenpox.htm| title=Chickenpox (varicella) |accessdate= 2010-11-06}}</ref> The rash caused by varicella zoster virus may however last for up to one month, although the infectious stage does not take longer than a week or two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.varicellazoster.net/| title=Varicella Zoster Virus|accessdate= 2010-11-06}}</ref> 

Although there have been no formal clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of topical application of [[calamine lotion]], a topical barrier preparation containing [[zinc oxide]] and one of the most commonly used interventions, it has an excellent safety profile.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tebruegge M, Kuruvilla M, Margarson I |title=Does the use of calamine or antihistamine provide symptomatic relief from pruritus in children with varicella zoster infection? |journal=Arch.

[[Acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) but not [[aspirin]] may be used to reduce fever. Aspirin use by someone with chickenpox may cause the serious, sometimes fatal disease of the liver and brain, [[Reye syndrome]]. People at risk of developing severe complications who have had significant exposure to the virus may be given intra-muscular varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG), a preparation containing high titres of antibodies to varicella zoster virus, to ward off the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Parmet S, Lynm C, Glass RM |title=JAMA patient page.

===Children===
If oral [[acyclovir]] is started within 24 hours of [[rash]] onset it decreases symptoms by one day but has no effect on complication rates. Use of acyclovir therefore is not currently recommended for immunocompetent individuals (i.e., otherwise healthy persons without known immunodeficiency or on immunosuppressive medication).  Children younger than 12 years old and older than one month are not meant to receive [[antiviral medication]] if they are not suffering from another medical condition which would put them at risk of developing complications.<ref name="urlAntiviral medications for chickenpox">{{cite web |url=http://children.webmd.com/vaccines/antiviral-medications-for-chickenpox |title=Antiviral medications for chickenpox |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref>

Treatment of chickenpox in children is aimed at symptoms while the immune system deals with the virus.  With children younger than 12 years cutting [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] and keeping them clean is an important part of treatment as they are more likely to scratch their blisters more deeply than adults.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Chickenpox-in-Children-Under-12.htm|title=Chickenpox in Children Under 12|accessdate= 2010-11-06}}</ref>

[[Aspirin]] is highly contraindicated in children younger than 16 years as it has been related with a potentially fatal condition known as [[Reye's syndrome]].<ref name="urlReyes Syndrome-Topic Overview">{{cite web |url=http://children.webmd.com/tc/reyes-syndrome-topic-overview |title=Reye's Syndrome-Topic Overview |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref>

Some parents believe that it is better for children to contract chickenpox than to get the vaccine, and deliberately expose their children to the virus, sometimes by taking them to "[[pox party|chickenpox parties]]." Some doctors counter that children are safer getting the vaccine, which is a weakened form of the virus, than getting the disease, which can be fatal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chicken Pox parties do more harm than good, says doctor |publisher=KSLA News 12 Shreveport, Louisiana News Weather & Sports |url=http://www.ksla.com/story/16317324/chicken-pox-parties-do-more-harm-than-good-says-doctor}}</ref>

===Adults===
[[Infection]] in otherwise healthy adults tends to be more severe.<ref name="pmid18555533">{{cite journal |author=Tunbridge AJ, Breuer J, Jeffery KJ |title=Chickenpox in adults - clinical management |journal=The Journal of Infection |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=95–102 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18555533 |doi=10.1016/j.jinf.2008.03.004 |url=}}</ref> [[therapy|Treatment]] with antiviral [[drugs]] (e.g. [[acyclovir]] or [[valacyclovir]]) is generally advised, as long as it is started within 24–48 hours from rash onset.<ref name="urlAntiviral medications for chickenpox"/> Remedies to ease the symptoms of chickenpox in adults are basically the same as those used on children. Adults are more often prescribed antiviral medication as it is effective in reducing the severity of the condition and the likelihood of developing complications. Antiviral medicines do not kill the virus, but stop it from multiplying.  Adults are also advised to increase water intake to reduce dehydration and to relieve headaches. Painkillers such as [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) are also recommended as they are effective in relieving itching and other symptoms such as fever or pains. Antihistamines relieve itches and may be used in cases where the itches prevents sleep, because they are also [[sedative]]. As with children, antiviral medication is considered more useful for those adults who are more prone to develop complications. These include [[pregnant women]] or people who have a weakened immune system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Chickenpox-in-Adults-and-Teenagers.htm| title=What is chickenpox?|accessdate= 2010-11-06}}</ref>

[[Sorivudine]], a nucleoside analogue has been reported to be effective in the treatment of primary varicella in healthy adults (case reports only), but large-scale clinical trials are still needed to demonstrate its efficacy.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1131785|Chickenpox|treatment}}</ref>

After recovering from chickenpox, it is recommended{{By whom|date=October 2012}} adults take one injection of [[VZV immune globulin]] and one injection of varicella vaccine or [[Zostavax|herpes zoster vaccine]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Prognosis==
The duration of the visible blistering caused by varicella zoster virus varies in children usually from 4 to 7 days, and the appearance of new blisters begins to subside after the 5th day. Chickenpox infection is milder in young children, and symptomatic treatment, with [[sodium bicarbonate]] baths or [[antihistamine]] medication may ease itching, it is recommended to keep new infants from birth till 6 months of age away from an infected person for 10 to 21 days as their immune systems are not developed enough to handle the stress it can bring on.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Somekh E, Dalal I, Shohat T, Ginsberg''''' GM''''', Romano O |title=The burden of uncomplicated cases of chickenpox in Israel |journal=J.

Varicella can be lethal to adults with impaired immunity. The number of people in this high-risk group has increased, due to the HIV epidemic and the increased use of immunosuppressive therapies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Strangfeld A, Listing J, Herzer P, ''et al.'' |title=Risk of herpes zoster in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with anti-TNF-alpha agents |journal=JAMA |volume=301 |issue=7 |pages=737–44 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19224750 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.146 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2009.146}}</ref> Varicella is a particular problem in hospitals, especially when there are patients with immune systems weakened by drugs (e.g., high-dose steroids) or [[HIV]].<ref name=Weller>{{cite book |author=Weller TH |chapter=Varicella-herpes zoster virus |title=Viral Infections of Humans: Epidemiology and Control |editor=Evans AS, Kaslow RA |publisher=Plenum Press |year=1997 |pages=865–92 |isbn=978-0-306-44855-3}}</ref>

Secondary bacterial infection of skin lesions, manifesting as [[impetigo]], [[cellulitis]], and [[erysipelas]], is the most common complication in healthy children.  Disseminated primary varicella infection usually seen in the immunocompromised may have high morbidity. Ninety percent of cases of varicella pneumonia occur in the adult population. Rarer complications of disseminated chickenpox also include [[myocarditis]], [[hepatitis]], and [[glomerulonephritis]].<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://dermatology.about.com/cs/chickenpox/a/chickencomp.htm Chicken Pox Complications<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Hemorrhagic complications are more common in the immunocompromised or immunosuppressed populations, although healthy children and adults have been affected. Five major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile purpura, malignant chickenpox with [[purpura]], postinfectious purpura, [[purpura fulminans]], and [[anaphylactoid purpura]]. These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile purpura being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome. In contrast, malignant chickenpox with purpura is a grave clinical condition that has a mortality rate of greater than 70%. The etiology of these hemorrhagic chickenpox syndromes is not known.<ref name="autogenerated1" />
