'''Congenital glaucoma''' is evident either at birth or within the first few years of life. This condition is caused by abnormalities in anterior chamber angle development that obstruct aqueous outflow in the absence of systemic anomalies.<ref name=yanoff />

== Epidemiology ==
* Incidence: one in every 10000-15000 live births.

* Bilateral in up to 80% of cases.

* Most cases are sporadic (90%). However, in the remaining 10% there appears to be a strong familial component.

== Ocular manifestations ==
The typical infant who has congenital glaucoma usually is initially referred to an ophthalmologist because of apparent [[corneal edema]]. The commonly described triad of [[Epiphora (medicine)|epiphora]] (excessive tearing), blepharospasm and photophobia may be missed until the corneal edema becomes apparent.<ref name=yanoff />

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis is clinical. The [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP) can be measured in the office in a conscious swaddled infant using a Tonopen or hand-held Goldmann tonometer. Usually, the IOP in normal infants is in the range of 11-14 mmHg.<ref name=yanoff />

==Differential diagnosis==
Corneal cloudiness may have a myriad of causes. Corneal opacity that results from hereditary dystrophies is usually symmetric.
Corneal enlargement may result from [[megalocornea]], a condition in which the diameter of the cornea is larger than usual and the eye is otherwise normal.

==Systemic associations==
Two of the more commonly encountered disorders that may be associated with congenital glaucoma are [[Aniridia]] and [[Sturge-Weber syndrome]].

==Treatment==
The preferred treatment of congenital glaucoma is surgical not medical. The initial procedures of choice are goniotomy or trabeculotomy if the cornea is clear, and trabeculotomy ab externo if the cornea is hazy. The success rates are similar for both procedures in patients with clear corneas. Trabeculectomy and shunt procedures should be reserved for those cases in which goniotomy or trabeculotomy has failed. Cyclophotocoagulation is necessary in some intractable cases but should be avoided whenever possible because of its potential adverse
effects on the lens and the retina.<ref name=ao />
