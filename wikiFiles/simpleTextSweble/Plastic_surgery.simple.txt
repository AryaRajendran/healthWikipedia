 Ambulatory care is a personal health care consultation, treatment or intervention using advanced medical technology or procedures delivered on an outpatient basis (i.e. where the patient's stay at the hospital or clinic, from the time of registration to discharge, occurs on a single calendar day). Many medical investigations and treatments for acute illness and preventive health care can be performed on an ambulatory basis, including minor surgical and medical procedures, most types of dental services, dermatology services, and many types of diagnostic procedures (e.g. blood tests, X-rays, endoscopy and biopsy procedures of superficial organs). Other types of ambulatory care services include emergency visits, rehabilitation visits, and in some cases telephone consultations. Ambulatory care services represent the most significant contributor to increasing hospital expenditures and to the performance of the health care system in most countries, including most developing countries. Health care organizations use different ways to define the nature of care provided as "ambulatory" versus inpatient or other types of care. Sites where ambulatory care can be delivered include: One or more planned revisits to settings of ambulatory care is the main method of follow-up of previous care in both ambulatory and inpatient settings. It can be regarded as an intermediate level of follow-up between continuous monitoring in an inpatient setting on one hand, and the situation where an individual is advised to return only when (or if) symptoms appear or reappear on the other.
