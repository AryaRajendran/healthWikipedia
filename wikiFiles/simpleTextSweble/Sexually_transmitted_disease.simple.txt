 A sexually transmitted disease is a disease which generally spreads by sexual intercourse, including oral sex or anal sex. "Sexually transmitted disease" is usually written as STD for short. STDs can also be called sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or venereal diseases (VD). It is more accurate to call sexually transmitted diseases sexually transmissible diseases. This is because some of them spread in other ways, too (see section on HIV below for example). There are two ways that sex can send a disease from one person to another person: Additionally, there is currently no form of protection against certain STDs, like herpes (a painful virus that causes growths in the groin or mouth for the rest of one's life, with no known cure), or pubic lice. It is important to know the health risks of having sex as well as the emotional issues, and most of all to talk to one's partner. In some countries, up to one out of every four teenage girls might have an STD. Prevention is very important for serious STIs - like HIV and herpes. Sexual health clinics promote the use of condoms and often distribute them for free. The best way to prevent STIs to spread is to avoid sexual contact. It is advised to get to know a person before starting sexual relationship. Asking a person to do health check is also lowering the risk. Today more and more people get access to database of sexual health clinics that can be searched using internet. Use of condoms lower the risk of getting infected. Condom is the most effective way to limit STDs but there are some rare examples of infections being spread even when using one. Some infections take time to show any symptoms - so testing should be done regulary. Some infections can limit our protection against other diseases causing our body to get multiple viruses at once. Some STI's can cause death - especially when multiple infections are detected. When STI is diagnosed patient should pause any sexual activity until his body will recover.
