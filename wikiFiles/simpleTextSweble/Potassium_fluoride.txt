 Potassium fluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KF. It contains potassium and fluoride ions. Potassium fluoride is a colorless crystalline solid. It rarely occurs in the ground. It dissolves easily in water. It can react with glass. Hydrofluoric acid is more effective at reacting with glass, though. It has to be stored in plastic or platinum containers. Potassium fluoride is made by reacting potassium carbonate with hydrofluoric acid. This reaction can make potassium bifluoride. Potassium bifluoride is a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and potassium fluoride. It is used because of its fluoride ion. It can be used to add fluoride ions to some chemical compounds. Potassium fluoride is somewhat toxic. It is corrosive to glass. It can burn when spilled on skin.
