 Tuberculosis, or TB for short, is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It used to be called consumption, but that name is no longer in use. TB is caused by various types of mycobacteria, usually Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The disease usually attacks the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. The pathogen can travel through the air, and spread from one person to the next. This happens when infected people cough, sneeze, or transmit their saliva through the air. Between five and ten people show symptoms, for every hundred people infected. In these people, the disease is called active. Left untreated, tuberculosis kills more than half of the people who are infected. Previously, TB was easily treated and cured with antibiotics. However, the bacterium is now highly resistant to most antibiotics. There is a form of tuberculosis that is resistant to all drugs. This resistance can make the treatment difficult: many different kinds of antibiotics need to be given over a long period of time. The diagnosis of active TB relies on radiology: in most cases an X-ray of the chest is done. In addition, body fluids are examined: These fluids contain microbes, which are grown in cell cultures. The cell cultures are then analysed to see if the person is infected with TB. If the disease does not show symptoms, it is 'latent'. To detect latent TB, a skin test, called the Mantoux test is done. Blood tests are often performed as well. There is a vaccine against some forms of tuberculosis. It is called bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine.

Countries with more cases are shown yellow, those with fewer cases are shown in blue. The most cases were recorded in Sub-Saharan Africa, many occurred in Asia as well.]] Experts believe that one third of the world population is infected with M. tuberculosis. New infections occur at a rate of one per second. In 2007, about 13.7 million chronic cases were active globally. In 2010, about 8.8 million new cases developed and nearly 1.5 million people died from the disease, most of them in developing countries. The absolute number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2006, and new cases have decreased since 2002. Tuberculosis is not distributed uniformly across the globe. About eighty percent of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive in tuberculin tests, but only five to ten percent of the United States population. People usually get tuberculosis because of a weakened immune system: Many are infected with HIV and also develop AIDS.
