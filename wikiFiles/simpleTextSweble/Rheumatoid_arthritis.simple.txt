 Rheumatoid arthritis is a severe and chronic condition that attacks flexible joints in the human body. The process is an inflammatory response of the capsule around joints, excess synovial fluid and the development of fibrous tissue in the synovium area. The pathology of this disease often leads to destruction of articular cartilage. The cause of this condition is not known, although autoimmunity plays a pivotal role in progression and chronicity. Women are three times more likely than men to be victims of rheumatoid arthritis. This condition was first recognized around 1800. category:Inflammation category:Joints
