 Down syndrome (also called Down's syndrome or trisomy 21; old name mongoloid idiocy) is a genetic disorder. It comes from a problem with the genes. Humans are diploid organisms. This means that for each chromosome, there are two copies, one from the mother, and one from the father. During meiosis the number is reduced to one set of chromosomes. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, or part of it. They usually have some measure of mental handicap, but this can range from mild to severe. Children who have this condition take more time to learn new things. They also grow differently from other children. Babies with Down syndrome can be identified at birth because they have a specific set of physical features, including narrow eyes, and flat nose-bridge, large tongues, and shorter fingers. Sometimes the little fingers curve inwards as well, and there is also often a space between the big toe and the others. The condition is named after John Langdon Down, the British doctor who first described it in 1866. He called it mongoloid idiocy, but that term is no longer used today, because of the disparaging nature of the term. Doctors in the UK usually inform others that people with the condition have a mild to medium learning difficulty. The same is true in the United States, although there is still sometimes discrimination against people with down syndrome, both in the education system and in society in general. Some people with the condition have average intelligence, but may have other problems with development instead. People with Down syndrome often have a different shape of eyes than most people. A few people with the condition have severe learning difficulties. Of every 800 to 1000 babies that are born, one is diagnosed with Down syndrome. The Down Syndrome Association of Los Angeles keeps a list of people with Down syndrome with roles in TV and movies. For comprehensive lists of Down syndrome links see By Country
