 A hernia is a condition where an organ or tissue goes into places in the human body that it is not normally in. Most hernias happen in the abdomen. Hernias sometimes give pain and a lump that can be felt. The cause can be hereditary or it can be from lifting objects in a wrong way. There are other things that can give hernias as well.
