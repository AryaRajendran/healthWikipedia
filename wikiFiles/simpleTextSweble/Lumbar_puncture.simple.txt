 A lumbar puncture (often called spinal tap, by non-doctors) is a medical method to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (fluid from the brain). This can be either done to analyse the sample, to find some hints to diseases. It can also be done to lower the pressure of the fluid inside the skull.
