 Varicose veins are a condition in which the veins in the leg area have become enlarged. If veins have become varicose, the leaflets of the valves do not work properly, and in turn, the vein valves themselves won't work. The blood then flows backwards, at which point the veins then start to increase. This condition is most common in superficial veins which involve the legs. The condition not only causes cosmetic troubles, it also creates itching and painful problems. category:Health problems category:Cardiovascular system
