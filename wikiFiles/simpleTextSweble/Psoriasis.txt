 The American Osteopathic Board of Anesthesiology (AOBA) is an organization that provides board certification to qualified Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) who specialize in the administration of anesthetic agents and perioperative medicine (anesthesiologists). The board is one 18 medical specialty certifying boards of the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists approved by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), and was established in 1956. As of December 2011, 605 osteopathic anesthesiologists held active certification with the AOBA. The AOBA is one of two certifying boards for anesthesiologists in the United States. The other certifying authority is the American Board of Anesthesiology, a member board of the American Board of Medical Specialties. Initial certification is available to osteopathic anesthesiologists who have successfully completed an AOA-approved residency in anesthesiology, two years of practice, and successful completion of written exams, oral exams, and clinical exams. Board certified osteopathic anesthesiologists must renew their certification every ten years to avoid expiration of their board certified status. Osteopathic anesthesiologists may also receive Certification of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in Critical Care Medicine and pain management. The Certification of Added Qualifications must be maintained through the process of recertification every 10 years.
