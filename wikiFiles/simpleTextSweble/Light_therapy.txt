 Light therapy is a treatment where the patient is exposed to light. Depression, sleeping problems, and many skin disorders are treated with this therapy. The therapy consists of exposing the patient to a light source. The light source usually emits the full spectrum of light. Sometimes, this has to be done at a specific time of day.
