 Coprophagia is the eating of faeces. Many animals eat faeces, either their own or that of other animal groups. It is particularly common in dogs and puppies of about six months old, but little is known why; lack of stimulus and variety in the lifestyle or diet have been cited as potential reasons. Adding pineapple to their food is a well recognized solution for many dogs. Humans do it only on rare occasions and it is looked down upon in society. Eating one's feces can also spread disease.
