 Prostatectomy is the surgical removal of part or all of the prostate. It is often used in the treatment of inability to urinate or of prostate cancer. Patients who are having a prostatectomy can expect to stay in the hospital for two to four days. A tube called a catheter is usually left in the patient's bladder for two or three weeks, which can result in the patient having problems controlling his bladder for awhile.
