 Follicle-stimulating hormone (abbreviated FSH, sometimes called Follitropine) is a glycoprotein and sex steroid. It is synthesised in the pituitary gland. In females it will cause the growth of follicles in the ovaries, in males, it will lead to the production of sperm. Other hormones control the release of FSH. Luteinizing hormone will cause ovulation in females, or the production of testosterone in males.
