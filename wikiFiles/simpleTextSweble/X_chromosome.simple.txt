 The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes which decide if a person is a boy or a girl. The other chromosome is the Y chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, males have one X and one Y. An egg always carries a single X, while sperms carry either an X or a Y. That is how sex is determined in humans, and in most other mammals.
