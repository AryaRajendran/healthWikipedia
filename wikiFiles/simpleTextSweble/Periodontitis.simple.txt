 Periodontitis is a set of diseases which usually attacks the tissues surrounding the teeth. Periodontitis in comparison with Gingivitis is a more severe inflammation, because not only it affects the tissues, but also, it affects the bottom of the teeth. If it is not treated at all, it may lead to a loss of teeth. The word "periodontitis" comes from peri ("around"), odont ("tooth") and -itis ("redness"). Periodontitis doesn't just affect the gums and teeth, but reports have stated that it may increase risk of stroke. It may also cause memory problems for those over 60 years of age.
