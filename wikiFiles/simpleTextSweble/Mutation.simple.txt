 In biology, a mutation is a change in the genetic material. This means changes to the DNA or to the chromosomes which carry the DNA. All such changes are heritable (can be passed on to the next generation) unless they have lethal effects. Mutations can happen for several reasons. It can happen because of errors when meiosis produces the gametes (eggs & sperms). Damage by radiation, or by certain chemicals may cause mutations, but they do occur occasionally at random. Also, by derivation, an individual carrying the mutation may be called a mutant or a mutation. So is the trait (character) most obviously affected by the mutation. When DNA is copied mistakes are sometimes made – these are called mutations. There are four main types of mutations: These terms are explained in the third diagram. Mutations may be bad for the organism, or neutral, or of benefit. Sometimes mutations are fatal for the organism – the protein made by the 'new' DNA does not work at all, and this causes the embryo to die. On the other hand, evolution is moved forward by mutations, when the new version of the protein works better for the organism. Mutations are the ultimate source of variation, upon which natural selection acts. What happens is that some mutations affect the organism's ability to live and reproduce. This is an important part of the theory of evolution. The amount of heritable variation carried by a population can be huge, and as a consequence natural populations have the capacity to change and adapt to conditions in their environment.
