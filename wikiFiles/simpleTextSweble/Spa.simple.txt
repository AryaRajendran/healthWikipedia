 The term spa is associated with water treatment of disease by bathing. Spa towns, spa resorts, and hot springs resorts often offer various health treatments. People have believed in the helpful powers of mineral waters back to prehistoric times. This practice has been popular worldwide. It is especially widespread in Europe and Japan. The term came from the name of the town of Spa, Belgium. This name was known back in Roman times, when it was called Aquae Spadanae. It may be related to the Latin word "spargere" meaning to scatter, sprinkle or moisten.
