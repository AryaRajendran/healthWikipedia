 Cytokines are signaling proteins which the body makes. They help to control the immune system and fight disease. Cytokines are small proteins which carry signals locally between cells, and have an effect on other cells. They are a category of signalling molecules. They are proteins, peptides, or glycoproteins. The term cytokine includes a large family of polypeptide regulators that are produced throughout the body by many groups of cells. Some well-known kinds include interferon, histamine, prostaglandin and interleukins. Cytokines can be detected using the ELISA and ELISPOT techniques.
