 Binge drinking is a practice where people drink alcoholic beverages mainly to get drunk. This is either done by drinking a lot over a short period of time, or by drinking a moderate amount over a longer period of time. Even though binge drinking is often done in groups, it is different from social drinking. Binge drinking has been in the news because people who are not yet old enough to drink alcohol sometimes go to events where binge drinking happens
