 António Egas Moniz (António Caetano de Abreu Freire Egas Moniz, 29 November 1874 – 13 December 1955), known as Egas Moniz, was a Portuguese neurologist. He developed cerebral angiography, a technique to visualise the blood vessels in and around the brain. He developed the surgical procedure termed leucotomy (also known as lobotomy). Egas Moniz is sometimes regarded as the founder of modern psychosurgery. Egas Moniz became the first Portuguese national to receive a Nobel Prize when, in 1949, he shared it with Walter Rudolf Hess. He held academic positions, wrote many medical articles and also served in several legislative and diplomatic posts in the Portuguese government. In 1911 he became professor of neurology in Lisbon until his retirement in 1944. At the same time, he pursued a demanding political career.
