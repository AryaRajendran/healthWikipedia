 The American Medical Women's Association (AMWA) is a professional advocacy and educational organization of women physicians and medical students. Founded in 1915 by Bertha VanHoosen, the AMWA works to advance women in medicine and to serve as a voice for women's health. The association used to publish the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association; the Journal of Women's Health is now the official journal of the AMWA. The AMWA honors women physicians each year with four awards. The AMWA also established The International Women in Medicine Hall of Fame to recognize contributions made by women in the medical profession. The more than two dozen inductees include the first woman physician, Elizabeth Blackwell; and two former Surgeon Generals of the United States Antonia Novello and Joycelyn Elders. In 2010, the inductees were Linda A. Randolph, president and CEO of the Developing Families Center, an innovative model for healthcare delivery to poor families; and Diana Zuckerman, a health policy expert who is president of the National Research Center for Women & Families. The latter is the first non-physician inducted. The AMWA has published a number of books, primarily in the field of women's health.
