 Childhood obesity consists of excess body fat that adversely affects children's health and well being. Obesity for children is especially dangerous because many overweight children will become overweight adults. Health problems related to overweight kids include but are not limited to Type 2 diabetes in adolescence and young adulthood, heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure, diseases which until recently were not common in children and teenagers.
