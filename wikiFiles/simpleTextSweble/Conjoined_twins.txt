 Conjoined twins, also known as Siamese Twins are twins whose bodies are joined together at birth. This happens where the zygote of identical twins fails to completely separate. Conjoined twins occur in an estimated one in 200,000 births, and approximately half are stillborn. The overall survival rate for conjoined twins is between 5% and 25%. Conjoined twins are more likely to be female (70-75%). Daisy and Violet Hilton are a famous pair of conjoined twins. They were born in Brighton and were kept on top of the Evening Star pub, where they were taught to dance by a cruel barmaid. She then sold them and they toured Vaudeville. They became famous in the movie Freaks and lived long lives, eventually getting married.
