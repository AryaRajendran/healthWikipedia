 Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI) is the only organisation in the world working at the international level to end acid and burns violence. Recognising the need for local knowledge and expertise in order to combat acid violence effectively, ASTI founded and continues to support the development of five partner organisations in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Pakistan and Uganda. It also works with UN agencies, NGOs and strategic partners from across the world to increase awareness of acid violence and develop effective responses at the national and international level. ASTI is a registered charity in England and Wales. ASTI is aimed at helping victims get medical treatment, rehabilitation and reintegration into the community whilst offering legal help.
