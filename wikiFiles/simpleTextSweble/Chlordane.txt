 Chlordane is an insecticide, introduced in 1947. It is an organochloride that acts like a contact poison. It can be produced using the Dielsâ€“Alder reaction, and has at least 147 constituents. Its main use was in treating seeds, e.g. of potatoes, wheat, or vegetables. It was also used for wood preservation, and against ants and termites. Chlordane only degrades slowly, which means that it is relatively easy to spread it over long distances. It accumulates in the body of animals, in mammals mostly in the nervous system and the liver. Chlordane has been shown to cause cancer in mice; it may cause cancer in humans. Chlordane is toxic. It is listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
