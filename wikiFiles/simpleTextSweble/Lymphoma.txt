 Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. There are many types of lymphoma, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, the primary central nervous system lymphoma, the B-cell lymphoma, and the hepatosplenic lymphoma. Chemotherapy is often used for both Hodgkin lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas. Radiotherapy may also be used.
