 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is a group of rare neurometabolic disorders characterized by the significant elevation of urinary levels of hydroxyglutaric acid. It is either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant. 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is an organic aciduria, and because of the stereoisomeric property of 2-hydroxyglutarate different variants of this disorder are distinguished: The L-2 form is more common, severe, and mainly affects the central nervous system. The basal ganglia are affected, and cystic cavitations in the white matter of the brain are common, beginning in infancy. This form is chronic, with early symptoms such as hypotonia, tremors, and epilepsy declining into spongiform leukoencephalopathy, muscular choreodystonia, mental retardation, and psychomotor regression. It is associated with L2HGDH. The D2 form is rare, with symptoms including macrocephaly, cardiomyopathy, mental retardation, hypotonia, and cortical blindness. It is caused by recessive mutations in D2HGDH (type I) or by dominant gain-of-function mutations in IDH2 (type II). The combined form is characterized by severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy and absence of developmental progress. It is caused by recessive mutations in SLC25A1 encoding the mitochondrial citrate carrier.
