 Overweight is the condition of a person when they have more fat in their body than what is thought as to be normal for their height. To find out if a person is overweight, you can calculate their body mass index. People with a BMI of 25 or more are said to be overweight. Anything above 30 is said to be obese, and anything below 20 is considered normal.
