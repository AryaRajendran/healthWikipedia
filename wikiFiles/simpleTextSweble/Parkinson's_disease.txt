 Parkinson's disease (also known as Parkinson disease or just PD) is a slow damaging disease of the central nervous system in which dopamine is lost. It hurts the patient's movement skills and their speech, but the former is much more specific. Sometimes it can also affect their mood, behavior, and thinking. Parkinson's Disease can cause the brain to not respond, and paralyze the patient. The disease could give the patient slow reaction time and poor hand to mind coordination.
