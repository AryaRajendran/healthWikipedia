 Appendicitis is a medical condition. It is when the vermiform appendix gets inflamed. The infection can be very dangerous. Usually, the inflamed appendix is removed. If it is not treated, many people die from it, mainly because of peritonitis and shock. Reginald Fitz first described acute appendicitis in 1886. It is one of the leading causes worldwide of pain in the belly.
