 Medicine is the science that deals with diseases (illnesses) in humans and animals, the best ways to prevent diseases, and the best ways to return to a healthy condition. People who practice medicine are most often called medical doctors or physicians. Often doctors work closely with nurses and many other types of health care professionals. The word medicine can also mean special food or a chemical that makes someone better when they are ill. A lot of medicines are liquid and can be bought in a small bottle. Other medicines may come in pills or capsules. The doctor may tell the patient (person who is ill) how much medicine to take each day. Most medicines cannot be bought unless a doctor (or other authorized professional) has prescribed the medicine for the patient. The patient takes the prescription to the chemist (or "pharmacist") who gives them the medicine. There are different aspects of medicine that specialist doctors deal with. For example, paediatrics is the study of diseases that affect children. Health
