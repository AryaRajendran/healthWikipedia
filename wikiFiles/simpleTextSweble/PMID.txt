 PMID or "PubMed ID" is an acronym for "PubMed IDentifier" number. PubMed is a free internet resource of the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM); and a PMID is a special number which is assigned to each PubMed record. PMIDs do not change over time and they are never reused. Any PMID is only a number. The PMID tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content of any publication.
