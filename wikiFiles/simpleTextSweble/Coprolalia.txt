 Coprolalia is a condition that affects about 15% of people with Tourette syndrome. Someone with coprolalia will use words that make people feel uncomfortable so often that it is hard to control. This is often in the form of a stream of curse words. People who have Tourette syndrome arenot the only people who experience coprolalia. For example, it can happen in people who have had a stroke, or who have schizophrenia.
