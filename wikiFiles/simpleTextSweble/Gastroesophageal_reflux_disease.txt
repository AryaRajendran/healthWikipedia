 Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic medical problem involving the part of the body which runs from the mouth to the stomach. The problem exists when stomach contents move backwards towards the mouth. Food or liquid moves from the stomach into the tube between the mouth and the stomach. That tube is called the esophagus. The burning sensation is commonly called "heartburn," but it has nothing to do with the heart.
