 Connective tissue is a fibrous tissue. It is one of the four traditional classes of tissues (the others being epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue). Connective tissue (CT) is found throughout the body. It has 3 main components; cells, fibres, and extracellular matrix. Connective tissue makes up a variety of physical structures including, tendons, blood, cartilage, bone, adipose tissue, and lymphatic tissue. CT is classified into three subtypes; Embryonic CT, Proper CT, and Special CT. Collagen is the main protein of connective tissue in animals and the most abundant protein in mammals, making up about 25% of the total protein content.
