 Leukemia or leukaemia is a cancer of blood and bone marrow. When a person has leukemia, the body makes too many white blood cells (leukocytes). There are many kinds of leukemia. Leukemias are part of a bigger group of diseases, the blood cancers (hematological neoplasms). Untreated, leukemia may lead to death within weeks to months. Chronic leukemias can last for years. In 2000, approximately 256,000 children and adults around the world developed some form of leukemia, and 209,000 died from it. About 90% of all leukemias are diagnosed in adults. Leukemia can be either acute or chronic. Acute leukemia usually grows quickly. Chronic leukemia usually grows slowly. Leukemia can also involve two different types of white blood cells. These are lymphoid cells and young granulocyte cells (which are called 'myelocytes'). For this reason, all of the different forms of leukemia are categorized into four major types: The causes of leukemia are not known in detail. In general, all cancers have a breakdown in the normal way cell division is controlled. Most likely, the different kinds of leukemias have different causes. The known causes account for relatively few cases. Most of the causes are outside our control. Researchers believe the following may influence whether a person develops leukemia: Viruses that are suspected to cause leukemia include: Fanconi anemia is also a risk factor for developing acute myelogenous leukemia. Most cases of leukemia are treated with a number of drugs, which are usually combined into a chemotherapy. In some cases, radiation therapies or bone marrow transplants are done.
