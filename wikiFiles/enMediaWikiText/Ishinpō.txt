 is the oldest surviving Japanese medical text. It was written by Tamba Yasuyori in 984 and is 30 volumes in length. The work is based on the Chinese Bìng Yuánhóu lún, written by Suí Dynasty author Cháo Yuánfāng. Many of the Ishinpō texts have been lost in China, and have only survived to the present day through their inclusion in the work. It is a national treasure of Japan. The structural organization of the text is as follows: Volume Subject 1 Overview 2 Acupuncture and moxibustion 3 Internal medicine 4 Dermatology 5 Otolaryngology 6 Internal medicine 7 Surgery and internal medicine 8 Internal medicine 9 Internal medicine 10 Internal medicine 11 Internal medicine 12 Internal medicine 13 Internal medicine 14 Internal medicine 15 Surgery 16 Surgery 17 Surgery 18 Surgery 19 Pharmacology 20 Pharmacology 21 Gynaecology 22 Obstetrics 23 Obstetrics 24 Obstetrics and gynaecology 25 Pediatrics 26 Health 27 Health 28 Human sexual behavior 29 Dietary health 30 Dietary health The Ishinpō is notable for preserving some of the Taoist sexual manuals from the Han to the Tang dynasty. The twenty-eighth section of the Ishinpō contains a complete transcription of a Daoist text known as The Classic of Sunu which is a dialogue between the Dark Maiden and the Yellow Emperor, with the former providing advice on sexual practices to the latter. While the text is written in kanbun, Japanese terms are written to the side in Man'yōgana for plants, animals, and minerals.
