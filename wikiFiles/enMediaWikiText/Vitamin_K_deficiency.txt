 Vitamin K deficiency is a form of avitaminosis resulting from insufficient vitamin K<sub>1</sub> or vitamin K<sub>2</sub> or both. Vitamin K<sub>1</sub>-deficiency may occur by disturbed intestinal uptake (such as would occur in a bile duct obstruction), by therapeutic or accidental intake of a vitamin K<sub>1</sub>-antagonist such as coumadin, or, very rarely, by nutritional vitamin K<sub>1</sub> deficiency. As a result, Gla-residues are inadequately formed and the Gla-proteins are insufficiently active. Symptoms include ecchymosis, petechiae, hematomas, oozing of blood at surgical or puncture sites, stomach pains; risk of massive uncontrolled bleeding; cartilage calcification; and severe malformation of developing bone or deposition of insoluble calcium salts in the walls of arteries. In infants, it can cause some birth defects such as underdeveloped face, nose, bones, and fingers. According to a study published in the October 14, 2008 edition of PLoS Medicine, Vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (5 mg of K<sub>1</sub>/day) does not protect against age-related decreasing bone density, but may protect against fractures and cancers, in postmenopausal women taking calcium and vitamin D supplements. Menaquinone (vitamin K<sub>2</sub>), but not phylloquinone (vitamin K<sub>1</sub>), intake is associated with reduced risk of CHD mortality, all-cause mortality and severe aortic calcification. The prevalence of vitamin K deficiency varies by geographic region. For infants in the United States, vitamin K<sub>1</sub> deficiency without bleeding may occur in as many as 50% of infants younger than 5 days old. Therefore, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that 0.5 to 1.0 mg Vitamin K<sub>1</sub> be administered to all newborns shortly after birth. Postmenopausal and elderly women in Thailand have high risk of Vitamin K<sub>2</sub> deficiency, compared with the normal value of young, reproductive females.Current dosage recommendations for Vitamin K may be too low. The deposition of calcium in soft tissues, including arterial walls, is quite common, especially in those suffering from atherosclerosis, suggesting that Vitamin K deficiency is more common than previously thought.
