 <onlyinclude> This is a list of notable people who have, or had, the medical condition epilepsy. Following from that, there is a short list of people who have received a speculative, retrospective diagnosis of epilepsy. Finally there is a substantial list of people who are often wrongly believed to have had epilepsy.</onlyinclude> A possible link between epilepsy and greatness has fascinated biographers and physicians for centuries. In his Treatise on Epilepsy, the French 17th century physician Jean Taxil refers to Aristotle's "famous epileptics". This list includes Hercules, Ajax, Bellerophon, Socrates, Plato, Empedocles, Maracus of Syracuse, and the Sibyls. However, historian of medicine Owsei Temkin argues that Aristotle had in fact made a list of melancholics and had only associated Hercules with the "Sacred Disease". Taxil goes on to add his own names: Roman Emperor Caligula, Drusus (tribune of the Roman people), Muhammad, and Petrarch. More recently, many saints and other religious figures have been suspected of having had temporal lobe epilepsy. J.E. Bryant's 1953 book, Genius and Epilepsy, has a list of more than 20 people that combines the great and the mystical. Recent scholars are more skeptical. Neuropsychiatrist Peter Fenwick is amongst those who question the widespread labeling of religious figures with temporal lobe epilepsy. He believes this may "owe more to the enthusiasm of their authors than to the true scientific understanding" In a recent detailed review of the subject, neurologist John Hughes concluded that the majority of famous people alleged to have epilepsy did not in fact have this condition. This categorised chronological list contains only those people with a firm and uncontested diagnosis made while still alive. <onlyinclude> {| class=wikitable|-! style="width:17%;"| Name! style="width:13%;"| Life! style="width:65%;"| Comments! style="width:5%;"| Reference|- valign="top"| Bud Abbott| 1897–1974| The straight man in the comedy team of Abbott and Costello.

Philip K. Dick 1928–1982 A science fiction writer. One biographer suggests temporal lobe epilepsy as a possible cause of his visions, but also regards such speculation as futile and unverifiable. Many religious figures have been suspected of having had temporal lobe epilepsy. Looking for physical explanations of mystical experiences is controversial. Sudden religious conversion, together with visions, has been documented in a small number of individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy, but the association between epilepsy and intense religious feelings is rare. Aspects of the Geschwind syndrome have been identified in some religious figures, in particular – extreme religiosity and hypergraphia (excessive writing). Many neurologists strongly question the presence of a link between any personality profile and epilepsy. The presence of an entry in the following list does not indicate a scholarly consensus in favour of a diagnosis of epilepsy; merely that such a diagnosis has been suggested. Name Life Comments Reference The Priestly source of the Pentateuch c700 BC According to one researcher, the writing has a pedantic and aggressive style, shows extreme religiosity, verbosity and redundant style.

However, it is not in the temporal lobe and other researches suggest psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, or a combination. Joan of Arc 1412–1431 Experienced religious messages through voices and visions which she said others could sometimes experience simultaneously. Some researchers consider the visions to be ecstatic epileptic auras, though more recent research may implicate idiopathic partial epilepsy with auditory features. Epileptic seizures with clear auditory and visual hallucinations are very rare. This, together with the extreme length of her visions, lead some to reject epilepsy as a cause. Saint Catherine of Genoa 1447–1510 No specific details available. Saint Teresa of Ávila 1515–1582 Visions, chronic headaches, transient loss of consciousness and also a four-day coma. Saint Catherine of Ricci 1522–1590 Visual hallucinations. Loss of consciousness for 28 hours. Saint Marguerite Marie 1647–1690 No specific details available. Mme.

White 1827–1915 Severe head injury followed by three weeks of limited consciousness. Her visions involved loss of consciousness, upward eye deflection, visual hallucinations, affective changes, gestural automatisms, preservation of speech, a post-ictal-like period. Further, she meets several criteria for the Geschwind syndrome: extreme religiosity, hypergraphia (100,000 pages in 4,000 articles), repetitiveness, hypermoralism, and hyposexuality. Saint Thérèse de Lisieux 1873–1897 Seized with "strange and violent tremblings all over her body". Visual hallucinations and celestial visions. Many famous people are incorrectly recorded as having epilepsy. In some cases there is no evidence at all for a diagnosis of epilepsy. In others, the symptoms have been misinterpreted. In some, the seizures were provoked by acute illness or alcohol withdrawal, for example. The following people are often reported to have had epilepsy but there is no evidence that they had any attacks or illnesses that even resembled epilepsy.

Pythagoras 582–507 BC Aristotle 384–322 BC Hannibal 247–183 BC Carthaginian military leader. Hermann von Helmholtz 1821–1894 Agatha Christie 1890–1976 Many individuals have been mistakenly recorded as having epilepsy due to an association with someone (real or fictional) who did have epilepsy, or something similar. Name Life Comments Reference Dante Alighieri 1265–1321 In his fictional La Divina Commedia, he falls into a "dead faint". Isaac Newton 1643–1727 In 2000, a paper was published comparing Newton's psychosis with that of a patient with psychosis, who additionally happened to have generalised tonic-clonic seizures. It is possible that ambiguities in the introduction to this paper led readers to associate the epilepsy with Newton rather than the patient. Ludwig van Beethoven 1770–1827 His acquaintance Antonie Brentano had a son, Karl Joseph, who had epilepsy. Alfred Tennyson 1809–1892 Close family had epilepsy and mental illness, which led Tennyson to fear this in himself.

Patrick Dempsey born 1966 Played a boy with epilepsy in the 1986 Disney TV Movie "A Fighting Choice". He won an award from the Epilepsy Foundation for his convincing portrayal. The following people may have had one or more epileptic seizures but since the seizures were provoked, they do not result in a diagnosis of epilepsy: Name Life Comments Reference Edgar Allan Poe 1809–1849 Poe abused drugs and alcohol. If he had any seizures, they were most likely due to alcohol withdrawal. One author has suggested Poe may have had complex partial seizures. Leo Tolstoy 1828–1910 "Fits of spleen" and anguish attacks. Had seizures while dying of pneumonia. Algernon Charles Swinburne 1837–1909 Alcohol withdrawal attacks.

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky 1840–1893 Seizures in the hours before death. Possible family history of epilepsy. Franklin D. Roosevelt 1882–1945 Thought to have complex partial seizures attributable to cerebrovascular disease. Truman Capote 1924–1984 Alcohol withdrawal seizures. Richard Burton 1925–1984 Alcohol withdrawal seizures. There are many conditions that produce paroxysmal attacks or events. These events (especially in historical, non-medical literature such as biographies) are often called fits, seizures or convulsions. Those terms are not exclusive to epilepsy and such events are sometimes categorised as non-epileptic seizures. When studied in detail, the attacks were more fully described as "fits of spleen", "seized by pain", "convulsed with anguish", etc. Name Life Comments Reference Alexander the Great 356–323 BC Collapsed after taking strong medicine for pneumonia. Charles the Fat c.839–888 Commonly regarded as a sickly king, with epilepsy, who had a "fit" in Frankfurt in 873.

More recent biographical information led John Hughes, in 2005, to conclude that Flaubert had psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, and migraine. <ref name="Hughes2005" /> Guy de Maupassant 1850–1893 Mental illness and hallucinations caused by inhaling ether. <ref name="Hughes2005" /> Vincent van Gogh 1853–1890 Over 150 physicians have produced nearly 30 different diagnoses for van Gogh's illness. Henri Gastaut's posthumous diagnosis was "temporal lobe epilepsy precipitated by the use of absinthe in the presence of an early limbic lesion". This agrees with that of van Gogh's own doctor, Felix Rey, who prescribed potassium bromide. That van Gogh's personality closely matches the Geschwind syndrome is seen as further evidence by some. Not everyone agrees – a recent review by John Hughes concluded that van Gogh did not have epilepsy. He certainly was mentally ill at times and had "fainting fits" after heavy drinking. Graham Greene 1904–1991 Greene was diagnosed with epilepsy as a young man, after several episodes of loss of consciousness. His impending marriage was at risk and he considered suicide. Treatment consisted of good walks and Kepler's Malt Extract. Greene eventually distrusted the diagnosis and it is now considered likely that the episodes were fainting spells. John Berryman 1914–1972 Diagnosed with petit mal epilepsy, now reckoned to have been nervous exhaustion. Berryman suffered from depression and alcoholism. <div class="references-small" style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;"></div>
