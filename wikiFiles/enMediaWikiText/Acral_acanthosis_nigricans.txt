 Acral Acanthosis Nigricans also known as Acral Acanthotic Anomaly (AAA) - Acral acanthosis nigricans is a common and thus important variant of Acanthosis nigricans. Classical acanthosis nigricans is characterized by hyperpigmented, velvety thickening of the skin typically on the nape and sides of the neck and in the axillae and groin. It is also known as acral acanthotic anomaly, the two terms being synonymous. The former emphasizes that it is a type of acanthosis nigricans, the latter its uniqueness. It was discovered by internationally renowned dermatologist Robert A. Schwartz. Its original description in 1981 observed it as a disorder seen relatively commonly as velvety hyperpigmented plaques in dark complexioned individuals. It is often particularly prominent over the elbows, knees, knuckles and dorsal surfaces of the feet in otherwise healthy individuals with axillae and other intertriginous regions appearing normal. The etiology of acral acanthosis nigricans is unknown. Its presence does not suggest the necessary of an evaluation for the presence of internal malignancy.
