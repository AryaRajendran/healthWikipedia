 Breast enlargement supplements are frequently portrayed as being a "natural" means to increase breast size, and with the suggestion that they are free from risk. The popularity of breast enlargement supplements stems from their heavy promotion, targeted toward women. At times, testimonials by companies have been faked. Products typically contain a variety of ingredients of plant or fungal origin. The compounds claimed to be pharmacologically active are typically estrogen mimics (called xenoestrogens; specifically known as phytoestrogens in plants and mycoestrogens in fungi). Commonly used ingredients include: Although breast enlargement supplements are targeted toward women, there is inadequate scientific study whether herbal breast enlargement can be safely achieved. It is unlikely that any of the common ingredients would be efficacious. No randomized, blinded and fully controlled tests has been performed to test any breast enhancement product. Some of the active ingredients are potentially dangerous for consumption or use. Herbal products are normally sold under "generally regarded as safe" (GRAS) rules and are not approved for this indication. No non-surgical products are known to have been approved by the FDA or other medicines regulators for indications including breast enhancement. Naturally occurring compounds produced by plants and fungi can nonetheless carry serious health risks. One potential risk is an increased chance of breast cancer. Some of the ingredients included in supplements are carcinogenic, including don quai. By altering the body's hormonal levels, certain ingredients, including zearalenone, may reduce fertility. One ingredient, kava may cause liver damage over time. Black cohosh has been shown to have no estrogenic effect in vivo or in vitro. Hops contain estrogen-like compounds, called prenylflavonoids. Hops' role on fertility lacks research. The role of hops in cancer due to hormones is not fully documented. Zearalenone and its derivatives are a class of xenoestrogens associated with many herbal bust enhancement products. There have been some indications that Zearalenone can increase the size of breasts in humans, but there are no tests of efficacy or safety. Zearalenone, produced by a toxic fungus, is a mycoestrogen that stimulates the growth of breast cancer cells, increases the chance of estrogen dependent breast cancer, and may reduce fertility. Other supplements are unlikely to have been spoiled with the mould. Indirect assay tests of the product Erdic (also known as Bust out) on the uterus of rodents, by measuring the amount of estrogen present, showed no difference from the control. Another test, of a hops based product on mice showed only weak effects even for high dosages.
