 Instruments used in Microbiological sterilization and disinfection are as follows: __Forcetoc__ Instrument !! Uses Instrument sterilizers Used to sterilize instruments in absence of an autoclave Dressing drums storage of gowns, cotton, linen, etc. The microscope used for visualising minute structures including microbes. Various stains used to stain microscopic slides to get contrast Hot air oven used in sterilizing instruments for various aseptic procedures, specially if that can not be autoclaved like powders. Koch's or Arnold's steam sterilizer used for steam sterilization A pressure cooker used as a portable autoclave. Biological and chemical indicators Used to ascertain if a certain process has been completed, e.g. spores used in an autoclave are killed if autoclaving is properly done.For details, see indicators Filters: •Candle filter: used as household water filters and as filters for large particles in the laboratories. ••Diatomaceous earth filters like the Berkefeld filter -do- ••Unglazed porcelain filters like the Chamberland filter -do- •Disk filter or Seitz filter previously used as bacteriological filters •Sintered glass filter used as a good particle filter in laboratories. •Membrane filter and Syringe filter used as primary bacterial/cell filters in procedures as toxin, immunoglobulin, etc. production, where the product gets denatured on heating. •Air filter like HEPA filter, used in various laboratories and clean rooms to produce lamellar air flow. Radiation: •Gamma ray source used in sterilization of heat-labile products like plastic or rubber syringes, catheters and gloves. •X-ray source -do- •Infrared light source -do- •Ultraviolet light source -do- Inspissator used to produce culture media for bacteriology that contain egg or serum, which coagulate on heating. Tyndallizer a process of sterilization from spore bearing bacteria Water bath to heat things uniformly from all sides at a set temperature up to the boiling point of water. Needle Destroyer Burns the needle electrically either cuts the syringe manually or burns it electrically Sharps container A imperforable container for sharp wastes like needles, blades, microscope slides, broken glass, etc. Cardboard biomedical waste containers Reusable tubs || Colour coded biomedical waste bags (India) - •Yellow plastic bags for human anatomical, animal, microbiological and soiled waste. •Red disinfected container or plastic bags microbiological waste, solid waste(IV tubes, catheters, etc.) •Blue or White plastic bag or puncture proof containers sharps, disposable tubing, etc. •Black Plastic bag or puncture proof containers discarded medicines, incineration ash, chemical waste Disinfectants for cleaning Incinerators to burn biomedical wastes like removed body parts, blood, gauze, linen, etc.
