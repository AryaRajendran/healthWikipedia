 Cansema (also known as black salve) is a brand name of a popular alternative cancer treatment. The product is commonly classified as an escharoticâ€”that is, a topical paste which burns and destroys skin tissue and leaves behind a thick, black scar called an eschar. Escharotics were widely used to treat skin lesions in the early 1900s, but have since been replaced by safer and more effective treatments. Escharotics such as Cansema are currently advertised by some alternative medicine marketers as treatments for skin cancer, often with unsubstantiated testimonials and unproven claims of effectiveness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration listed Cansema as a "fake cancer cure" and warned consumers to avoid it. Cancer salves were first documented as a form of quackery in a 1955 Time article:More recent reports document the ongoing marketing of escharotics via the Internet as purported "cures" for skin cancer. Cansema and other escharotics are not recommended as treatments for skin lesions or skin cancer. The effectiveness of escharotics is unproven, and much safer and more effective alternatives exist, such as Mohs surgery. Escharotics can cause serious scarring and damage to normal skin. Their manufacture is largely unregulated, so the strength and purity of marketed products are unknown and unverified. Numerous reports in the medical literature describe serious consequences of using escharotics in place of standard treatments for skin cancer, ranging from disfigurement to preventable cancer recurrences. The website Quackwatch posted a warning against the use of escharotics in 2008. The site collected a variety of sourced documents compiling issues of patient injury from the use of escharotics.Common ingredients of black salves include zinc chloride, chapparal (or Larrea tridentata). and often bloodroot, a plant which has numerous uses in herbal medicine.The extract of bloodroot is called sanguinarine, an ammonium salt which attacks and destroys living tissue and is also classified as an escharotic. Cansema is listed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as one of 187 fake cancer cures. Cansema continues to be marketed by numerous individuals, as referenced by recent FDA Warning Letters. The FDA has taken enforcement action against illegal marketing of Cansema as a cancer cure, as in the 2004 arrest and conviction of Greg Caton. The FDA has taken an active role in the banning of these chemicals for use as a cancer cure. Typical warning letters detail the dangers of this product while also admonishing the purveyors of their obligation to comply with federal law. Summaries of recent letters are cataloged on the FDA website. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia is advising consumers against purchasing or using black salve, red salve or cansema products. The TGA has found the Australian Vaccination Network (AVN) in breach of advertising regulations, and in a separate finding the AVN's former president Meryl Dorey together with Leon Pittard of Fair Dinkum Radio were found to be in breach.
