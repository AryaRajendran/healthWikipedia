 Serum sickness in humans is a reaction to proteins in antiserum derived from a non-human animal source, occurring 4–10 days after exposure. It is a type of hypersensitivity, specifically immune complex hypersensitivity (type III). The term serum sickness–like reaction (SSLR) is occasionally used to refer to similar illnesses that arise from the introduction of certain non-protein substances. It was first characterized by Clemens von Pirquet and Béla Schick in 1906. When an antiserum is given, the human immune system can mistake the proteins present for harmful antigens. The body produces antibodies, which combine with these proteins to form immune complexes. These complexes enter walls of blood vessels and initiate an inflammatory response. They can also cause more reactions resulting in typical symptoms of serum sickness. This results in hypocomplementemia, a low C3 level in serum. Serum sickness can be developed as a result of exposure to antibodies derived from animals. These sera or antitoxins are generally administered to prevent or treat an infection or envenomation. Some of the drugs associated with serum sickness are: Allergenic extracts, hormones and vaccines can also cause serum sickness. Symptoms can take as long as 14 days after exposure to appear, and may include signs and symptoms commonly associated with allergic reactions or infections. Diagnosis is based on history given by patient, including recent medications. With discontinuation of offending agent, symptoms usually disappear within 4–5 days. Corticosteroids, Antihistamines, and analgesics are main line of treatment. The choice depends of severity of reaction. Use of plasmapheresis has also been described. Avoidance of antitoxins that may cause serum sickness is best way to prevent seum sickness. Physicians should make their patients aware of the drugs that they are allergic to. Skin testing is done for identifying individuals who may be at risk of reaction.
