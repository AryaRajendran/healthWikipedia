 Dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency is a condition involving inadequate Dopamine beta hydroxylase. A deficiency of norepinephrine and epinephrine that causes orthostatic hypotension, nasal stuffiness, and droopy eyelids (ptosis) among other symptoms. Some people refer to this as norepinephrine deficiency. It's caused by largely increased amounts of serum dopamine and release of dopamine in place of norepinephrine. It is difficult for people with this to stand still for longer than one minute. Another symptom is hypoglycemia which is thought to be caused by adrenomedullary failure and the T-wave abnormalities from failure of noradrenergic control. Also, prolactin is frequently suppressed by excessive dopamine. This can also have an impact on digestion. "Dopamine has an emetic effect and inhibitis digestive motricity". People with dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency may have a paradoxical response to NRI antidepressant medication such as Edronaxâ€”they may experience more depression, less energy, and become more sleepy.This is a form of dysautonomia but differentiated from familial dysautonomia by lack of familial dysautonomic symptoms such as loss of sense of pain and smell. Most people can be treated using L-Threo-DOPS. Some other OTC medications can be beneficial as well. Researchers of disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and migraines are very interested in studying this disorder, as the persons generally have triple fold amounts of dopamine in their system and yet are generally normal. Other medications that can bring relief include: Untreated individuals with DBH deficiency should avoid hot environments, strenuous exercise, standing still, and dehydration.
