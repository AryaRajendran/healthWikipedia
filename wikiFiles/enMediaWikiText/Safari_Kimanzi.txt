 Safari Kimanzi (or Kimanthi), best known as just "Safari" (born c. 1994) is a Kenyan who as a boy received surgery to correct disfigurement from severe burns. He was operated on by volunteers at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA) in Sydney, Australia. His case was brought to the attention of the Australian public primarily through the television series RPA which was filmed at the hospital, and covered Safari repeatedly. Many donations were raised through the "Safari Appeal". Safari lives with foster parents in Australia. Safari is from Kasaala, a small village in the Ikutha Division of Kitui District, in the Eastern Province of Kenya, a country in East Africa. The village is located by the Tsavo National Park. He was born around the year 1994. The book Let the Journey Begin: Safari's Story, written by Safari and others, was published in 2001. Safari's mother died in 2003 from snakebite. As of 2007, Safari lives with foster parents Janet Seath and Frank Scaysbrook in the town of Buttaba, in the City of Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, Australia. The couple has published the book Safari: I Won't Cry, Mother. In 2010, Seath and Scaysbrook criticised the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), a major sponsor, for not providing promised funds. ADRA had raised $180,000 in 2001, for Safari's village and for his education and care. Criticisms aired on television program A Current Affair and Sydney radio station 2GB, on 7 January. In response ADRA rejected the charges, and claimed a formal NSW state government investigation had found the complaint to be unjustified. Dr. David Pennington, the head of plastic surgery at the RPA hospital, and who led the surgical team, also rejected the charges. {{Persondata | NAME = Kimanzi, Safari | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION =| DATE OF BIRTH = 1994 | PLACE OF BIRTH =| DATE OF DEATH =| PLACE OF DEATH =}}
