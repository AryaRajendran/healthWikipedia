 JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical Association, is a weekly peer-reviewed medical journal published by the American Medical Association. Since 2011, the editor-in-chief is Howard C. Bauchner (Boston University), who succeeded Catherine D. DeAngelis, who had served since 2000. The journal was established in 1883, with Nathan Smith Davis as founding editor. The acronym JAMA was added in 1960. The journal has French and Spanish language editions. JAMA was established in 1883 by the American Medical Association and has been published continuously since then. It publishes original research, reviews, commentaries, editorials, essays, medical news, correspondence, and ancillary content (such as abstracts of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report). The journal covers all aspects of the biomedical sciences. Continuing Education Opportunities for Physicians is a semianual journal section providing lists for regional or national levels of continuing medical education (CME). JAMA has provided this information since 1937. Prior to 1955, the list was produced either quarterly or semiannually. Between 1955 and 1981, the list was available annually, as the number of CME offerings increased from 1,000 (1955) to 8,500 (1981). The AMA website states that webinars are available for CME. After the controversial firing of an editor-in-chief, George D. Lundberg, a process was put in place to ensure editorial freedom. A seven member oversight committee was created to evaluate the editor-in-chief and to help ensure editorial independence. Since its inception, the committee has met at least once a year. Presently, JAMA states that article content should be attributed to authors and not the publisher. This journal is abstracted and indexed in: According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2011 impact factor of 30.026, ranking it third out of 153 journals in the category "Medicine, General & Internal".
