 The liver produces urea in the urea cycle as a waste product of the digestion of protein. Normal human adult blood should contain between 7 to 21 mg of urea nitrogen per 100 ml (7–21 mg/dL) of blood. Individual laboratories may have different reference ranges, and this is because the procedure may vary. BUN is an indication of renal health. Normal ranges 8-20 mmol/L. If Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and blood volume decrease (hypovolemia) then BUN will increase.Other factors responsible for its increment are fever, increased catabolism, high protein diet and gastrointestinal bleeding. BUN (urea-N) is g/dL in the United States, Mexico, Italy, Austria, Germany. Elsewhere, the concentration of urea is reported as mmol/L, generally depending on the lab. To convert from mg/dL of blood urea nitrogen to mmol/L of urea, multiply by 0.357 (each molecule of urea having 2 nitrogens, each of molar mass 14g/mol) convert BUN to urea in mg/dL by using following formula: (conversion factor derived by: MW of urea = 60, MW of urea nitrogen = 14x2 => 60/28 = 2.14) factor = 1 for conversions in mmol (1 mole N2 = 2 moles N per mole of urea):
