 A nocturnist is a hospital-based physician who only works overnight. Some nocturnists are trained in internal medicine, and have experience in hospital medicine. However, there are nocturnists trained in other specialties, such as psychiatry. The main role of a nocturnist is to admit patients into the hospital from an emergency room, and to care for previously admitted inpatients through the night.
