 Phagophobia (from Greek φαγεῖν - phagein, "eat" and φόβος - phobos, "fear") is a psychogenic dysphagia, a fear of swallowing. Phagophobia is classified as a specific phobia and according to DSM-IV classification it belongs to the category of "other phobias". Phagophobia may lead to (and be confused with) fear of eating, and the subsequent malnutrition and weight loss. In milder cases a phagophobe eats only soft and liquid foods.
