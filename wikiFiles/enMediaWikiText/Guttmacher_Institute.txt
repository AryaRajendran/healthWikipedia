 The Guttmacher Institute is a non-profit organization which works to advance reproductive health including abortion rights. The institute operates in the United States and globally "through an interrelated program of social science research, policy analysis and public education." According to their mission statement, this program aims to "generate new ideas, encourage enlightened public debate, promote sound policy and program development and, ultimately, inform individual decision making." The Guttmacher Institute in 1968 was founded as the Center for Family Planning Program Development, a semi-autonomous division of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The Center was renamed in memory of Alan Frank Guttmacher, an Ob/Gyn and former president of Planned Parenthood, and the Guttmacher Institute became an independent, not-for-profit corporation in 1977. The institute has offices in both New York City and Washington, D.C. As of 2007, it has an annual revenue of $15.8 million and expenses of $11.9 million, with an asset reserve of $22.4 million. The institute produces two peer reviewed periodicals, International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, in addition to a third periodical on public policy, The Guttmacher Policy Review.
