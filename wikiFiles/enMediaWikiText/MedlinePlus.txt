In the 1990s, the Library recognized that the general public was becoming an important user group, due to the increasing availability of Internet access. This new user group needed access to reliable health information in a consumer-friendly, Web-based format. The National Library of Medicine sought to meet this need with the introduction of MedlinePlus in October 1998. MedlinePlus debuted with 22 English-language health topics. Today, it has over 800 health topics in English and Spanish and also includes links to health information in over 40 languages.
