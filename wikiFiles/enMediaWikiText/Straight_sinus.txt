 The straight sinus (also known as tentorial sinus), within the human head, is an unpaired area beneath the brain which allows blood to drain from the inferior center of the head outwards posteriorly. It drains blood from the superior cerebellar veins and inferior sagittal sinus (at the center of the brain) to the confluence of sinuses (at the back of the head by the internal occipital protuberance). See diagram (at right): labeled in the brain as "SIN. RECTUS" (for Latin: sinus rectus). The straight sinus (tentorial sinus) is situated where the falx cerebri meets the midline of tentorium cerebelli. It forms from the confluence of the inferior sagittal sinus and great cerebral vein (great vein of Galen). In cross-section it is triangular, contains a few transverse bands across its interior, and increases in size as it proceeds backward.
