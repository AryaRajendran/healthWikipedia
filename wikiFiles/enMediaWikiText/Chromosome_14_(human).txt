 rightChromosome 14 is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 14 spans about 109 million base pairs (the building material of DNA) and represents between 3 and 3.5% of the total DNA in cells. Identifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 14 likely contains between 700 and 1,300 genes. The centromere of chromosome 14 is positioned approximately at position 19.0-19.1 Mbp. The following are some of the genes located on chromosome 14: The following diseases are some of those related to genes on chromosome 14:
