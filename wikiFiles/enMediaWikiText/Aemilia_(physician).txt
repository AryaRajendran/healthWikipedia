 Aemilia Hilaria (c. 300 â€“ c. 363) was a Gallo-Roman physician. She practiced medicine, and wrote books on gynecology and obstetrics. She was called "Hilaria" due to her cheerfulness as a baby. Aemilia was born in the Roman Empire in an area near what is now Moselle, France. She continued to live in the area as an adult and became a physician there. Aemilia was the maternal aunt of Ausonius, a Gallo-Roman who became tutor to the Emperor Gratian. Ausonius wrote a series of biographical poems about his family members, including Ameilia, called Parentalia. His poem about his aunt described her as a "dedicated virgin", who rejected marriage in order to further her career. He described her as "trained in the medical arts as well as any man." He called her an honest and skilled physician, who also assisted her physician brother in his own studies. Aemilia is a featured figure on Judy Chicago's installation piece The Dinner Party, being represented as one of the 999 names on the Heritage Floor.
