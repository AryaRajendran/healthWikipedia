 Maximum inspiratory pressure (M<sub>IP</sub>) is the value representing the highest level of negative pressure a person can generate on their own during an inhalation. Represented by centimeters of water pressure (cmH2O) and measured with a manometer. Maximum inspiratory pressure is an important and noninvasive index of diaphragm strength and an independent tool for diagnosing many illnesses. Typical maximum inspiratory pressures in adult males can be estimated from the equation, M<sub>IP</sub> = 142 - (1.03 x Age) cmH<sub>2</sub>O, where age is in years.
