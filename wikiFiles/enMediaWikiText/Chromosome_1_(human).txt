 Chromosome 1 is the designation for the largest human chromosome. Humans have two copies of chromosome 1, as they do with all of the autosomes, which are the non-sex chromosomes. Chromosome 1 spans about 249 million nucleotide base pairs, which are the basic units of information for DNA. It represents about 8% of the total DNA in human cells. Identifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Chromosome 1 is currently thought to have 4,316 genes, exceeding previous predictions based on its size. It was the last completed chromosome, sequenced two decades after the beginning of the Human Genome Project. The number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is about 740,000. The following are some of the genes located on chromosome 1: According to http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/posters/chromosome/chromo01.shtml the Chromosome 1 contains 263 million base pairs There are 890 known diseases related to this chromosome. Some of these diseases are deafness, Alzheimer disease, glaucoma and breast cancer. Rearrangements and mutations of chromosome 1 are prevalent in cancer and many other diseases. Patterns of sequence variation reveal signals of recent selection in specific genes that may contribute to human fitness, and also in regions where no function is evident.The following diseases are some of those related to genes on chromosome 1 (which contains the most known genetic diseases of any human chromosome):
