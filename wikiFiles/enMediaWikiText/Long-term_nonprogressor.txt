 Long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs), less commonly called elite controllers, are rare individuals who are infected with HIV, but control the infection without antiretroviral therapy. Many of these patients have been HIV positive for 30 years without progressing to the point of needing to take medication in order not to develop AIDS. They have been the subject of a great deal of research, since an understanding of their ability to control HIV infection may lead to the development of immune therapies or a therapeutic vaccine. Long-term nonprogressors typically have viral loads under 10,000 copies RNA/ml blood, do not take antiretrovirals, and have CD4+ counts within the normal range. Most people with HIV not on medication have viral loads which are much higher. It is estimated that around 1 in 500 people with HIV are long-term nonprogressors. Without the symptoms of AIDS, many LTNP patients may not know they are infected. The clinical relevance of the classification "Long-term non-progressor" is not definitive because some patients classified in this category have gone on to develop AIDS. It is likely, however, that these patients were not true LTNP patients. Genetic traits that confer greater resistance or more robust immune response to HIV are thought to explain why LTNP patients progress to the point of needing to take medication in order not to develop AIDS more slowly than most HIV-infected people. Some LTNP are infected with a weakened or inactive form of HIV, but it is now known that many LTNP patients carry a fully virulent form of the virus. Genetic traits that may affect progression include:
