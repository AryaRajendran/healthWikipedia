 Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) can occur in a developing fetus of a pregnant woman who has contracted rubella during her first trimester. If infection occurs 0–28 days before conception, there is a 43% chance the infant will be affected. If the infection occurs 0–12 weeks after conception, there is a 51% chance the infant will be affected. If the infection occurs 13–26 weeks after conception there is a 23% chance the infant will be affected by the disease. Infants are not generally affected if rubella is contracted during the third trimester, or 26–40 weeks after conception. Problems rarely occur when rubella is contracted by the mother after 20 weeks of gestation and continues to disseminate the virus after birth. It was discovered in 1941 by Australian Norman McAllister Gregg. The classic triad for congenital rubella syndrome is: Other manifestations of CRS may include: Children who have been exposed to rubella in the womb should also be watched closely as they age for any indication of the following: Vaccination of females of childbearing age against rubella can prevent congenital rubella syndrome.Termination of pregnancy is often recommended if exposure occurs or CRS is suspected antenatally.
