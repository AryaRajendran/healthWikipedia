 A Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) is a rare, slow-growing, histologically benign intracranial neoplasm or tumor that is commonly located in the ventricular system of the choroid plexus. It may obstruct the cerebrospinal fluid flow, causing increased intracranial pressure. The tumor is neuroectodermal in origin and similar in structure to a normal choroid plexus. They may be created by epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. Internationally tumors of the choroid plexus are rare, accounting for 0.4-0.6% of all intracranial neoplasms. It most commonly affects young children under the age of 5 with a mean patient age of 5.2 years. Signs of the tumor resulting from increased intracranial pressure are present in 91% of patients, with vomiting, homonymous visual field defects and headache being the most common symptoms. Choroid plexus papillomas are benign tumors that are usually cured by surgery; malignant progression has been rarely reported.
