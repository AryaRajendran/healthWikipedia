 Epilepsy in Females with Mental Retardation (EFMR) has been identified through the incidence of female seizure sufferers in a family over several generations. The first family was reported in 1971 in the Journal of Pediatrics. The striking pattern of onset at a young age, seizure patterns, test and laboratory results, potential developmental delays or developmental regression and associated disorders, eases diagnosis. Through the identification of genetic markers, diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. Based on a study conducted by the Epilepsy Research Center at the University of Melbourne's Department of Medicine estimated in 2007 that two thirds of EFMR patients have borderline intellectual functioning or intellectual disability. There appears to be a connection to depression, autism, obsessive and aggressive behaviors and other psychiatric disorders. EFMR was first described in a family in North America in 1971 in the Journal of Pediatrics and twice in the 1990s. The syndrome in this family was characterized by the occurrence of childhood seizures. Some of the girls showed developmental regression with intellectual disabilities that ranged from mild to profound. The disorder has an unusual inheritance pattern. It is considered X-linked dominant with male carriers. Women and men with the affected gene can transmit the disease. The men expressed a normal phenotype. The disorder was shown to be linked to mutations via Xq22 microsatellite markers. Published in 2007, a study was completed of four families with 58 individuals by the Epilepsy Resource Center at the University of Melbourne. The study included CT Scan and MRI imaging, electroencephalogram (EEG) testing, neurological exams, intellectual assessment and questionnaires to identify seizure history. It was found that the EFMR seizures generally began in females when they were infants, with mean onset at 14 months. They were likely to include an accompanying fever and may include convulsions. Seizures were of various types and appeared in clusters. Many seizures of short duration occur over a period of several days. The EEG test results showed "generalized and focal epileptiform abnormalities." Obsessive and aggressive behavioral characteristics and autistim were common associated disorders. Over the course of the female patients' childhoods, intellectual development was delayed in some cases, normal and then regressive in others and in some cases there was normal intellectual development. 67% of the females had mild to profound intellectual disability (ID) or borderline intellectual functioning. Some of the patients in the study were also with Angelman syndrome, sodium channelopathies or forms of Rett syndrome. The EFMR seizures generally ended later in the girl's childhood (mean age of 12 years), yet some continued into adulthood. Men and women are carriers of the disorder, although men do not generally exhibit EFMR history such as seizures and intellectual development issues, although 5 fathers in the 4 families had obsessive and controlling tendencies. The linkage of chromosome Xq22.1 to EFMR was confirmed in all of the families. A study in Florence, Italy by Dr. Carla Marini of 116 individuals, published in 2010, found a causal relationship between the PCDH19 gene and early onset female seizures, as did Dr. N. Specchio and others in a separate 2011 study in Italy. Other recent studies, such as L.M. Dibbens's work as reported in Neurology in 2011 that found instances where patients had PCDH19 mutation, but their parents did not. They found that "gonadal mosaicism of a PCDH19 mutation in a parent is an important molecular mechanism associated with the inheritance of EFMR. A study in Denmark of 18 unrelated females was reported in 2011 in Epilepsia by Dr. Hellen Hjalrim and others. One-third of subjects who exhibited early-onset EFMR-like symptoms had the PCDH19 mutations. Four men and women had the mutation but no symptoms. Most (15/18) had tested negative for SCN1A previously. They discovered a correlation between some females with early onset seizures and EFMR, based upon the presence of PCDH19 mutations. A study in Japan of 116 individuals was reported with similar findings. Although classified as a rare disease, eleven early studies indicate that between 5% and 10% of children with febrile seizures could have the PCDH19 gene. The European Bioinformatics Institute identified 107 experiments related to 73 parts of the body to better understand the PCDH19 gene. Men and women can transmit the PCDH19 mutation, although women but not men usually exhibit symptoms. Women with a mutation have a 50% chance of having children who are carriers. Males have a 100% chance of transmitting the mutation to a daughter and 0% chance to a son. The striking pattern of onset at a young age, seizure patterns, test and laboratory results, potential developmental delays or developmental regression and associated disorders, ease diagnosis. Through the identification of the genetic markers in studied families, diagnosis of an individual can be made through genetic testing. There appears to be an association in some cases between vaccinations and seizures with patients with Dravet syndrome (DS), Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and seizures in females with mental retardation (EFMR). An Italian multicentric study of the relationship between vaccinations and seizure occurrence found that vaccines were a trigger for seizures in 25% of the studied cases, but do not appear to affect the progression of seizures over time. New vaccines that have emerged in the past 10 years have reduced the incidence of seizures following vaccination. Acellular pertussis vaccine is an example of one such vaccine. Due to its recent discovery, EFMR does not have a specific classification according to the International League Against Epilepsy. Scheffer proposed at the XXIX International Congress of Epilepsy in Rome in August 2011 that this form of epilepsy be grouped with genetic epilepsies. EFMR is thought to develop based upon a deficiency of the calcium-dependent cell-adhesion PCDH19 (protocadherin 19) gene. Its etiology and pathophysiology (cause and mechanisms by which damage occurs) are different from other epilepsies, although the symptoms are very similar to other epileptic syndromes, such as Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), Dravet syndrome with SCN1A negative, FIRES (febrile infection–related epilepsy syndrome) Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or epilepsy of unknown origin. It occurs almost exclusively in girls, has been associated with febrile seizures or following immunization in the first stage of life, normally before three years old. Vaccines can trigger (not cause) seizures, especially the vaccine for pertussis-diphtheria-tetanus, as happens with Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (Dravet Syndrome). Seizures often occur with fever and/or convulsions and manifests in episodes of cluster seizures (many seizures in a day) and onset is usually before three years of age. Reversal of acquired intellectual capability over the course of childhood is possible, generally within three years of EFMR onset. Individuals with EFMR as GEFS+ present with a range of seizure types (partial, tonic, tonic-clonic, myoclonus, absences and atonic seizures). The test is particularly indicated in girls who have had cluster seizures in series. It is also recommended for patients who are diagnosed GEFS+ and when the seizures are associated with fever, infection, experienced regression, delayed cognitive growth or behavioral problems. The test is ordered by neurologists. The diagnostic test can be done by drawing blood or saliva of the patient and their immediate family. It is analyzed in laboratories that specialize in Genetic testing. Genetic testing can aid in a firmer diagnosis and understanding of the disorder, may aid in identifying the optimal treatment plan and if positive, testing of the parents can determine if they are carriers. (See Genetic Counseling) From the University of Melbourne study, two thirds of EFMR patients have borderline intellectual functioning or intellectual disability, while one third have normal intelligence. A connection to depression, autism, obsessive and aggressive behaviors and other disorders has been observed. It is not yet clear why some people experience delayed intellectual growth and others regress with epilepsy. Currently researchers disagree, some believing that the genetic load is responsible for developmental disorders and that seizures in themselves are not capable of causing brain damage if they are not prolonged. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are used in most cases to control seizures, but severe cases express high drug resistance. Patients may respond well to treatment with levetiracetam and in cases of drug resistance, an alternative treatment is stiripentol. Galaxolona is a neurosteroid that is currently in Phase III clinical trials and may offer an alternative therapy. No specific protocol or published research specifically supports the use of these drugs. All information about drug therapy here are from the experience of experts in the last International Epilepsy Congress. At the hospital, physicians follow standard protocol for managing seizures. Cluster seizures are generally controlled by benzodiazepines such as diazepam, midolazam, lorazepam or clonazepam. The use of oxygen is recommended in the United States, but in Europe it is only recommended in cases of prolonged epileptic status. The Epilepsies Research Center and Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, are working on a molecule to cure the disease. On May 26, 2011 it patented a method of diagnosis and EFMR treatment. Parallel associations European families are sponsoring basic and applied research in an Australian team and researching in other projects with the aim of finding a drug target for epilepsy PCDH19. Until Dr. Adrian Bird´s experiment with mice, it was assumed that all encephalopathies or cognitive impairments was irreversible, but Dr. Bird showed that is not always the case. During the experiment Bird blocked MECP2 protein and males died and females developed Rett syndrome (seizures, cognitive and psychomotor problems, respiratory problems, etc.) When the researcher reversed the situation and let the MECP2 protein work properly, the mice recovered. This research revolutionized understanding regarding genetic syndromes that present with neurological impairment or intellectual disabilities. Ethical considerations affect human experimentation that do not affect mice experiments.
