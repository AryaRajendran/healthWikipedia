 Nitrobenzene is an organic compound with the chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. It is a water-insoluble pale yellow oil with an almond-like odor. It freezes to give greenish-yellow crystals. It is produced on a large scale from benzene as a precursor to aniline. In the laboratory, it is occasionally used as a solvent, especially for electrophilic reagents. Nitrobenzene is prepared by [[nitration]] of benzene with a mixture of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], [[water]], and [[nitric acid]]. This mixture is sometimes called "mixed acid." The production of nitrobenzene is one of the most dangerous processes conducted in the chemical industry because of the exothermicity of the reaction (ΔH = −117 kJ/mol).
