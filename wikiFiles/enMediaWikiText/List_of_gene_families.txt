 This is a list of gene families or gene complexes, that is sets of genes which occur across a number of different species which often serve similar biological functions. These gene families typically encode functionally related proteins, and sometimes the term gene families is a shorthand for the sets of proteins that the genes encode. They may or may not be physically adjacent on the same chromosome.
