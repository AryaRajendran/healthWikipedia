 The comprehensive metabolic panel, or chemical screen, (CMP; CPT code 80053) is a panel of 14 blood tests which serves as an initial broad medical screening tool. The CMP provides a rough check of kidney function, liver function, and electrolyte and fluid balance, but it is far from perfect. Abnormal values from a CBC may be a result of false positives and thus the CBC may need to be repeated for a patient (or replaced with a more specific test). The CMP is an expanded version of the basic metabolic panel (BMP), which does not include liver tests. A CMP (or BMP) can be ordered as part of a routine physical examination, or may be used to monitor a patient with a chronic disease, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Previous names for the panel of tests have been Chem 12, Chemistry panel, Chemistry screen, SMA 12, SMA 20 and SMAC (Sequential Multiple Analysis - Computer). The tests are performed on machines based on the AutoAnalyzer invented in 1957. <div style="float:right;border:solid 10px white;"></div>Typically, the patient fasts for ten or twelve hours before the blood is drawn for the test. The following tests are then performed: These tests help screen for a wide variety of problems. The glucose test in particular helps screen for diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes. The calcium test can indicate or monitor bone diseases or diseases of the parathyroid gland or kidneys. Calcium salts, Lithium, Thiazide diuretics, Thyroxine, and vitamin D can all increase levels and may interfere with this test. Tests of protein levels in the blood help screen for both kidney and liver disorders. Electrolyte levels and the balance among them are tightly regulated by the body. Both individual values and ratios among the values are significant; abnormalities among either can indicate problems such as an electrolyte disturbance, acid-base imbalance, or kidney dysfunction.
