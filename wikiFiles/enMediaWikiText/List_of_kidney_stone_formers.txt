 There are a number of documented cases of historical figures and distinguished members of society who were kidney stone formers. This condition is caused by nephrolithiasis, which are more commonly known as kidney stones, or urolithiasis, where the stone forms in the urinary system. These are crystal deposits that can accrete in the urinary system when certain chemical substances become concentrated in the urine. Among the symptoms associated with nephrolithiasis are intense colicky pain, nausea, fever, chills, and the reduction or blockage of urine flow. Historically, the condition of having a kidney or bladder stone was referred to as "the stone" or "the gravel". In certain cases, kidney stone formation played a pivotal role in history. Most notably, some members of the royalty and military leaders became debilitated at important moments, such as Napoleon III of France during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and Athenian commander Nicias in the disastrous Sicilian Expedition of 415–3 BCE. Despite this condition, artists such as Arthur Sullivan and Michel de Montaigne managed to produce historically distinguished works; providing an example of perseverance in the face of severe and chronic pain. The medical advances of the twentieth century have allowed patients to survive the condition, whereas in the past it may have proven debilitating or fatal (as shown by the examples below). Kidney stones can reach exceptional size. In December 2003, a kidney stone weighing 356 g (12.5 oz) was removed from the right kidney of Peter Baulman of Australia. At its widest point, the stone measured 11.86 cm (4.66 in). In 2009, a 1.1 kg (2.48 lb) stone spanning 17 cm was surgically removed from Sandor Sarkadi in Debrecen, Hungary. As of August 2006, the most kidney stones ever passed naturally was 5,704 by Canadian Donald Winfield. The largest number removed through surgery was 728, during a three hour operation upon Mangilal Jain of India, on January 27, 2004. }} Derek Bell, }} Tony Fernandez, }} Bobby Jenks, }} Whitey Kurowski, }} Bill Mazeroski, }} Tom Niedenfuer, }} Miguel Olivo, }} Jay Payton, }} Brian Roberts, }} Tim Salmon, }} Joe Saunders, }} Josh Willingham }} and Robin Yount. Fictional incidents of kidney stones have been portrayed in the media on several occasions.
