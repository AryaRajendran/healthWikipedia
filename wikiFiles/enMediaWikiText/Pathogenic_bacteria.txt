 Pathogenic bacteria are bacteria that cause bacterial infection. This article deals with human pathogenic bacteria. Although the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial, quite a few bacteria are pathogenic. One of the bacterial diseases with highest disease burden is tuberculosis, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which kills about 2 million people a year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases, such as pneumonia, which can be caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus and Pseudomonas, and foodborne illnesses, which can be caused by bacteria such as Shigella, Campylobacter, and Salmonella. Pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, and leprosy. Koch's postulates are criteria designed to establish a causal relationship between a causative microbe and a disease. Each pathogenic species has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts. Conditionally pathogenic bacteria are only pathogenic under certain conditions, such as a wound that allows for entry into the blood, or a decrease in immune function. For example, Staphylococcus or Streptococcus are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing disease, but can potentially cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis, and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death. Some species of bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as obligate intracellular parasites (e.g. Chlamydophila, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia) that are able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. Still, infections with intracellular bacteria may be asymptomatic, such as during the incubation period. An example of intracellular bacteria is Rickettsia. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Mycobacterium, Brucella, Francisella, Legionella, and Listeria can exist intracellularly, though they are facultative (not obligate) intracellular parasites. Following is a list of bacterial infections classified by location in the body: Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics, which are classified as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. For example, the antibiotics chloramphenicol and tetracyclin inhibit the bacterial ribosome but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome, so they exhibit selective toxicity. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth. Both uses may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Phage therapy can also be used to treat certain bacterial infections. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilizing the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilized to prevent infection by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection. Bacteria in food are killed by cooking to temperatures above 73 °C (163°F). Following are the genera that contain the most important human pathogenic bacteria species: Genus Important species Gram staining Shape Capsulation Bonding tendency Motility Respiration Growth medium Intra/Extracellular Bordetella Gram-negative Small coccobacilli Encapsulated singly or in pairs aerobic Regan-Lowe agar extracellular Borrelia Gram-negative, but stains poorly spirochete Long, slender, flexible, spiral- or corkscrew-shaped rods highly motile anaerobic (difficult to culture) extracellular Brucella Gram-negative Small coccobacilli Unencapsulated singly or in pairs non-motile aerobic Blood agar intracellular Campylobacter Gram-negative Curved, spiral, or S-shaped bacilli with single, polar flagellum Unencapsulated Singly characteristic darting motion microaerophilic Blood agar inhibiting other fecal flora extracellular Chlamydia and Chlamydophila (not Gram-stained) Small, round, ovoid Unencapsulated motile Facultative or strictly aerobic Obligate intracellular Clostridium Gram-positive Large, blunt-ended rods Normally encapsulated mostly motile Obligate anaerobic Anaerobic blood agar extracellular Corynebacterium Gram-positive (unevenly) Small, slender, pleomorphic rods Unencapsulated clumps looking like Chinese characters or a picket fence nonmotile Mostly facultative anaerobic Aerobically on Tinsdale agar extracellular Enterococcus Gram-positive Round to ovoid (cocci) pairs or chains Non-motile Facultative Anaerobic 6.5% NaCl, bile-esculin agar extracellular Escherichia Gram-negative Short rods (bacilli) Encapsulated and Unencapsulated Normally motile Facultative anaerobic MacConkey agar extracellular or intracellular Francisella Gram-negative Small, pleomorphic coccobacillus Encapsulated Non-motile strictly aerobic (rarely cultured) Facultative intracellular Haemophilus Gram-negative Ranging from small coccobacillus to long, slender filaments Encapsulated or Unencapsulated Non-motile Chocolate agar with hemin and NAD<sup>+</sup> extracellular Helicobacter Gram-negative Curved or spiral rods pultiple polar flagella rapid, corkscrew motility Microaerophile Medium containing antibiotics against other fecal flora extracellular Legionella Gram-negative, but stains poorly Slender rod in nature, cocobacillary in laboratory. monotrichious flagella unencapsulated motile aerobic Specialized medium facultative intracellular Leptospira Gram-negative, but stains poorly Long, very slender, flexible, spiral- or corkscrew-shaped rods Highly motile Strictly aerobic Specialized medium extracellular Listeria Gram-positive, darkly Slender, short rods diplobacilli or short chains Distinct tumbling motility in liquid medium Facultative Anaerobic enriched medium intracellular Mycobacterium (none) Long, slender rods Unencapsulated nonmotile aerobic M. tuberculosis: Lowenstein-Jensen agar M. leprae: (none) extracellular Mycoplasma (none) Plastic, pleomorphic Encapsulated singly or in pairs Mostly facultative anaerobic (rarely cultured) extracellular Neisseria Gram-negative Kidney bean-shaped Encapsulated or Unencapsulated diplococci Non-motile aerobic Thayer-Martin agar Gonococcus: facultative intracellularN. meningitidis: extracellular Pseudomonas Gram-negative rods encapsulated motile Obligate aerobic MacConkey agar extracellular Rickettsia Gram-negative, but stains poorly Small, rod-like coccobacillary Slime/microcapsule Non-motile Aerobic (rarely cultured) Obligate intracellular Salmonella Gram-negative Bacilli Encapsulated Normally motile Facultative anaerobic MacConkey agar Facultative intracellular Shigella Gram-negative rods Unencapsulated Non-motile Facultative anaerobic Hektoen agar extracellular Staphylococcus Gram-positive, darkly Round cocci Encapsulated or Unencapsulated in bunches like grapes Non-motile Facultative anaerobic enriched medium (broth and/or blood) extracellular Streptococcus Gram-positive ovoid to spherical Encapsulated or Unencapsulated pairs or chains nonmotile Facultative anaerobic blood agar extracellular Treponema Gram-negative, but stains poorly Long, slender, flexible, spiral- or corkscrew-shaped rods highly motile Aerobic none extracellular Vibrio Gram-negative Short, curved, rod-shaped with single polar flagellum Unencapsulated rapidly motile Facultative anaerobic blood- or MacConkey agar.
