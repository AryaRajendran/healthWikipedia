 Muscle tissue is one of four basic biological tissues present in animals. It is a soft tissue that composes muscles. It is formed during embryo development in a process known as myogenesis. Muscle cells (myocytes) are elongated and classified and or compatible as either striated muscle cells or smooth muscle cells depending on the presence or absence, respectively, of organized, regularly repeated arrangements of myofibrillar contractile proteins called myofilaments. Striated muscle is further classified as either skeletal or cardiac muscle. Thus, muscle tissue can be described as being one of three different types: In vertebrates, there is a third muscle tissue recognized: Cardiac and skeletal muscles are "striated" in that they contain sarcomeres and are packed into highly regular arrangements of bundles; smooth muscle has neither. While skeletal muscles are arranged in regular, parallel bundles, cardiac muscle connects at branching, irregular angles (called intercalated discs). Striated muscle contracts and relaxes in short, intense bursts, whereas smooth muscle sustains longer or even near-permanent contractions.   smooth muscle cardiac muscle skeletal muscle Anatomy         Neuromuscular junction none none present   Fibers fusiform, short (<0,4 mm) branching cylindrical, long (<15 cm)   Mitochondria few numerous many to few (by type)   Nuclei 1 1 few   Sarcomeres none present, max. length 2,6 µm present, max. length 3,7 µm   Syncytium none (independent cells) none (but functional as such) present   Sarcoplasmic reticulum little elaborated moderately elaborated highly elaborated ATPase little moderate abundant Physiology         Self-regulation spontaneous action (slow) yes (rapid) none (requires nerve stimulus)   Response to stimulus unresponsive "all-or-nothing" "all-or-nothing"   Action potential yes none yes   Arbeitsbereich Kraft/Längen-Kurve ist variabel im Anstieg der Kraft/Längen-Kurve am Maximum der Kraft/Längen-Kurve Response to stimulus           Skeletal muscle is further divided into several subtypes:
