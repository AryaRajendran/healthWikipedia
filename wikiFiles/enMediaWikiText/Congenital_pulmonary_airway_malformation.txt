 Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is a hamartomatous lesion of the lung, with an incidence of about 1 in 5,000 live births. It can be separated into five types, based on clinical and pathologic features. CPAM type 1 is the most common, with large cysts and a good prognosis. CPAM type 2 (with medium-sized cysts) often has a poor prognosis, owing to its frequent association with other significant anomalies. Other types are rare.
