 In vertebrates, the pubic bone is the ventral and anterior of the three principal bones composing either half of the pelvis. It is covered by a layer of fat, which is covered by the mons pubis. It is divisible into a body, a superior ramus and an inferior ramus. The body forms one-fifth of the acetabulum, contributing by its external surface both to the lunate surface and the acetabular fossa. Its internal surface enters into the formation of the wall of the lesser pelvis and gives origin to a portion of the obturator internus. In the female, the pubic bone is anterior to the urethral sponge. The left and right hip bones join at the pubic symphysis. The pubis is the lower limit of the suprapubic region. The clade Dinosauria is divided into the Saurischia and Ornithischia based on hip structure, including importantly that of the pubis.
