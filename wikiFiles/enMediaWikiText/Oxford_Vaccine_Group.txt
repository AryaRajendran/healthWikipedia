It was founded in 1994 by Professor Richard Moxon, was initially based at the John Radcliffe Hospital, and moved in 2003 to its current location in the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (CCVTM) at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, England. The group, led by Professor Andrew Pollard since 2001, comprises around 75 members across a number of disciplines, including consultants in paediatrics and vaccinology, clinical research fellows, research nurses, statisticians, post-doctoral laboratory scientists, research assistants and DPhil students. According to its website, OVG "works towards the goal of developing new and improved vaccines for the prevention of infection in adults and children, enhancing the understanding of immunity and studying the epidemiology of infectious diseases". OVG conducts a significant number of clinical trials on new and improved vaccines. Since 2001, it has enrolled 11,000 adults and children into clinical trials in the Thames Valley area. Recent OVG research includes: In 2011, the group launched the Vaccine Knowledge Project, funded by the Oxford Biomedical Research Centre.
