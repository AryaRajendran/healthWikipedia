 Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science is a WASC accredited, private, non-profit school located in Willowbrook, unincorporated Los Angeles County, California, United States. It was founded in 1966 in response to inadequate medical facilities within the Watts region of Los Angeles, California, USA. Later, the institution became a University and changed its name in order to reflect its new academic role. The University is named in honor of Dr. Charles R. Drew. It was associated with the former-Martin Luther King Jr./Charles R. Drew Medical Center from 1972 to 2006, and sometimes referred to as King-Drew University. The university is a Historically Black College and University and a Minority Serving Institution. The university is a member-school of Thurgood Marshall College Fund On February 27, 2010 a U.S. Navy ship was named for Dr. Charles R. Drew, who revolutionized blood banking during World War II. A replica sits in the School of Nursing Lobby. The university is best known for its medical school designed to train physicians interested in working in urban environments, and founded in the response to the 1965 Watts riots to train minority doctors who would serve the poor of the South Los Angeles area. The following other academic programs are offered: Master of Science in Nursing which offers the Family Nurse Practitioner and Entry Level Master’s curricula of study, Urban Public Health Master of Public Health, General Studies, Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Pre-Medicine, Bachelor of Science in Life Sciences, Associate of Science in Health Information Technology, and Associate of Science in Radiographic Technology On August 13, 2010, the Charles Drew University Mervyn M.

The program was granted initial approval by the California Board of Registered Nursing in June 2009. . The Western Association of Schools and Colleges granted its approval in March 2009. A Family Nurse Practitioner Master of Science was added in 2011 . In 2011, the School of Nursing was granted initial full accreditation by both the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission and the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. The following other academic programs are offered: Master of Science in Nursing which offers the Family Nurse Practitioner and Entry Level Master’s curricula of study. The School of Nursing is the fastest growing program at the University. The university had a greater increase in publications this year than any other American research institution in a time where American publications are on the decline. In 2005 the University received $34 million in research funding. A large grant for translational research was awarded to the university in 2010. The AXIS (Accelerating eXcellence In Science) is modeled after similar translational research programs at universities such as Harvard. The purpose of AXIS is to conduct clinical and translational research, especially research that is focused on health disparities. Team science activities are supported by eleven core functions: Biomedical Informatics; Community Engagement; Concierge; Clinical Resource Center; Epidemiology and Biostatistics; Evaluation; Innovations and Partnerships; Pilot Program; Regulatory; Research Education and Training; and Technology Core Laboratories. The university's HIV research and services fall under DrewCARES; the Center for AIDS Research, Education, and Service. DrewCARES' goal is to provide care and services to underserved populations to reduce health disparities in South Los Angeles and extends to Central American, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa. The CDU PAETC (Pacific AIDS Education and Training Center) offers trainings, conferences, clinical consultations, and technical assistance to clinicians treating HIV positive patients and to local clinics and health centers. The university has on-campus clinics including SPECTRUM Community Services and Research, a HIV mental health clinic with social work, case management, substance abuse counseling, support groups, and treatment advocate services. CDU also has an HIV Testing Program and an HIV Early Intervention Program (EIP). HIV medical care is given at the LA County run OASIS Clinic. Services are rendered regardless of ability to pay. In July 2007, the university passed a curriculum review by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and retaining its accreditation, announcing plans for a new four-year medical school and nursing school in partnership with the University of California. At its meeting on June 17-19, 2009 the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities acted to place the university on Probation due to it having been found to have serious issues of noncompliance with the Commission Standards. The university has maintained its accreditation throughout this process. In July 2011, the university was removed from WASC Probation. Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital closed in 2007. Both the University and associated public hospital fell into serious trouble at the outset of the 21st century. By 2006, several residency programs had to be terminated because they lost accreditation for not meeting the necessary amount of oversight, and the hospital itself was forced into a radical restructuring plan in late-2006. The restructuring caused hospital to sever its ties to the neighboring medical school and terminate support to 248 medical residents. In October 2006, the national Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education informed school officials that it planned to revoke the university's accreditation because of the hospital's upcoming loss of Medicare money; as a result the university voluntarily withdrew its accreditation. The school can seek reinstatement to relaunch its residency program in July 2008, but given the restructuring of its former teaching hospital may not be able to meet that deadline. As a response to the problems, the university reorganized and got rid of its president and dismissed nearly two-thirds of its board of trustees. On March 6, 2007, officials from the university announced that they would sue Los Angeles County for $125 million for breach of contract, claiming that the restructuring of the hospital gutted the adjacent university. In September 2009, the lawsuit was settled with an agreement under which the county would rent space to the university on favorable terms and the county and university would work together toward the reopening of MLK Hospital. In June 2007, the school began an 18-month rebranding effort aimed at preventing people from associating the school with the continuing ordeals of King-Harbor; the school criticized the hospital for leaving an old sign bearing the King/Drew name. The Drew Saturday Science Academy was created in 1990 to encourage students to excel at science and math. The program provides: The program concludes with a white coat ceremony for the students. The Drew Saturday Science Academy Oath states "I, as a student of Charles Drew University ’s Saturday Science Academy II, promise by this oath that I shall treasure what I have learned in this program and continue my quest to higher education. Despite the obstacles that I may face in the future, I shall recognize that I have the power to overcome them and become a better person. And to show appreciation to those who have taught me, I shall accept the responsibility to teach others and to share my knowledge with everyone. I shall uphold these values to the best of my ability."
