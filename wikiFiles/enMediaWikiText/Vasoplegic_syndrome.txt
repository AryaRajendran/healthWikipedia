 Vasoplegic syndrome (VPS) is a postperfusion syndrome characterized low systemic vascular resistance and a high cardiac output. Vasoplegic syndrome is defined as low systemic vascular resistance ( SVR index <1,600 dynâˆ™seg/cm5/m2 ) and high cardiac output ( cardiac index >2.5 l/min/m2 ) within the first 4 postoperative hours. VPS occurs more frequently after on pump CABG surgery verses off pump CABG surgery. Hypothermia during surgery may also increase ones risk of developing VPS post operatively. There is some evidence to support the use of methylene blue in the treatment of this condition. One case series reports a rate of 1 in 120 cases.
