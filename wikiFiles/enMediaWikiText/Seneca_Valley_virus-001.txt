 Seneca Valley Virus or Senecavirusis a replication-competent oncolytic picornavirus. SVV-001 has selective tropism for cancers with neuroendocrine features including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and several pediatric solid tumors including retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and medulloblastoma. A Phase I clinical trial of SVV-001 in adults with neuroendocrine tumors showed that SVV-001 is apparently safe to administer at doses up to 1E11 vp/kg. It has potential antineoplastic activity. The complete genome sequence of SVV-001 was competed in 2008. An infectious clone of SVV-001 was reported in 2012. Seneca Valley virus has been proposed to attack cancer stem cells. Diagnostic monoclonal antibodies have been generated against Seneca Valley virus. It has been suggested that not enough safety information is yet available. This determination was made prior to results of the phase I clinical trial being published. While the sequence of SVV proteins is most similar to cardioviruses, the non-coding internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) is most similar to those of pestviruses including classical swine fever virus. The initial isolate, SVV-001, is being developed as an anti-cancer therapeutic by virtual company Neotropix, Inc. under the name NTX-010. It is believed that SVV-001 internalizes by receptor-mediated internalization, but as yet no host receptor has been identified.
