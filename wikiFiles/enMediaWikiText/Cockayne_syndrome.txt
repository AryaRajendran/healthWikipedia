 Cockayne syndrome (also called Weber-Cockayne syndrome, or Neill-Dingwall syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive, congenital disorder characterized by growth failure, impaired development of the nervous system, abnormal sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity), and premature aging. Hearing loss and eye abnormalities (pigmentary retinopathy) are other common features, but problems with any or all of the internal organs are possible. It is associated with a group of disorders called leukodystrophies. The underlying disorder is a defect in a DNA repair mechanism. It is named after English physician Edward Alfred Cockayne (1880–1956) and English dermatologist Frederick Parkes Weber (1863–1962). Neill-Dingwall syndrome was named after Mary M. Dingwall and Catherine A. Neill. Cockayne syndrome is classified genetically as follows: Type OMIM Gene A ERCC8 B ERCC6 C none known Mutations in the ERCC6 and ERCC8 genes are the cause of Cockayne syndrome. The proteins made by these genes are involved in repairing damaged DNA via the transcription-coupled repair mechanism, particularly the DNA in active genes. If either the ERCC6 or the ERCC8 gene is altered, DNA damage is not repaired. As this damage accumulates, it can lead to malfunctioning cells or cell death. Mutations in the ERCC6 gene mutation makes up ~70% of cases. Persons with this syndrome have smaller than normal head sizes, are of short stature, their eyes appear sunken, and they have an "aged" look.
