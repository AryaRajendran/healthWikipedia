 Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) is a cognitive rehabilitation therapy developed at King's College in London designed to improve neurocognitive abilities such as attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility and planning, and executive functioning which leads to improved social functioning. CRT has been used in the treatment of schizophrenia with positive results. In studies conducted at Kings College London with adults with anorexia nervosa CRT was shown to be beneficial in treatment, and in Poland among adolescents with anorexia nervosa, in the United States clinical trials are still being conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health on adolescents age 10-17 and Stanford University in subjects over 16 as a conjunctive therapy with Cognitive behavioral therapy. Research at King's College London further explains that people with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, are considered to be cognitively inflexible with their perspectives of food. Psychologist, Kate Tchanturia aims to correct the thinking of patients with eating disorders via Cognitive Remediation Therapy simultaneously with dietary modification and therapy. CRT has also been shown to be useful in both children and adults with ADHD., as well as for cognitive deficits associated with Major depressive disorder CRT has also been used in a subset of pediatric cancer survivors who experienced cognitive impairment due to the effects of cancer or cancer treatment on cognitive functioning. Clinical trials are slated to begin in 2010 in the United States by the National Institute of Health and the National Institute of Drug Abuse on the efficacy of cognitive remediation upon the cognitive deficits associated with drug abuse. CRT is usually administered via use of a computer, with the tasks appearing on the monitor. <div style="background:#CCC;border:1px solid #666;float:right;width:20%;padding:1em;margin:0 0 1em 1em;">Green Red BluePurple Blue Purple Blue Purple RedGreen Purple Green <div align="center">Stroop Test</div>Naming the color of the first set of words is easier and quicker than the second.</div> PMID 20350183 Two back n-back task A Q R Q Z V Z D X D L P L A Q R Q Z V Z D X D L P L Alice Medalia
