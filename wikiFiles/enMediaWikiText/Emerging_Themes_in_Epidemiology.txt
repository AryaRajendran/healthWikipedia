 Emerging Themes in Epidemiology is an online open access peer-reviewed medical journal. It is managed by current doctoral students and recent PhD graduates in the United Kingdom and Canada. The journal is based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and is published by BioMed Central. The journal has three guiding principles: The journal publishes articles related to any aspect of epidemiological research and practice, focusing on novel theoretical frameworks, methodological developments, causal inference, and epistemology. It does not generally consider reports of primary research, but publishes discursive pieces that comment critically on epidemiologic research and practice. It also publishes special collections of articles with the aim of bringing attention to emerging themes in public health. The journal was launched with a series of articles on the role of epidemiology in conflict settings, in collaboration with authors from a number of academic and public health institutions, and humanitarian organizations. Since then, the journal has published articles focusing on migration and health and methods for health surveys in hard-to-reach populations. The journal’s editor-in-chief is Peter Smith (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine). The journal’s editorial board is composed of current and former doctorate students at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Imperial College London, the Health Protection Agency Centre for Infections, the Institute of Child Health (London); the Oxford Medical Research Programme (Thailand); and the Université de Montréal (Canada).
