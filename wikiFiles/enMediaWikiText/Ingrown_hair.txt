 Ingrown hair is a condition where hair curls back or grows sideways into the skin. The ingrown hair condition is seen primarily among people having curly hair. It may or may not be accompanied by an infection of the hair follicle (folliculitis) or "razor bumps" (pseudofolliculitis barbae), which vary in size. While ingrown hair most commonly appears in areas where the skin is shaved or waxed (beard, legs, pubic region), it can appear anywhere. Anything which causes the hair to be broken off unevenly with a sharp tip can cause ingrown hairs. Shaving is the leading cause, followed by waxing and tight clothing. Symptoms include rash, itching skin, hair which remains in spite of shaving, and infection and pus collecting under skin.

Prophylactic treatments include twice daily topical application of diluted glycolic acid. Applying salicylic acid solution is also a common remedy for ingrown hairs caused by waxing or shaving.
