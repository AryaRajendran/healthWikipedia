 Folliculitis (also known as "Hot Tub Rash") is the inflammation of one or more hair follicles. The condition may occur anywhere on the skin with the exception of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They may appear as red dots that come to white tips on the chest, back and arms. Most carbuncles, furuncles, and other cases of folliculitis develop from Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Folliculitis starts when hair follicles are damaged by friction from clothing, an insect bite, blockage of the follicle, shaving, or braids too tight and too close to the scalp. In most cases of folliculitis, the damaged follicles are then infected with the bacterium Staphylococcus. Iron deficiency anemia is sometimes associated with chronic cases. The folliculitis usually occurs after sitting in a hot tub that was not properly cleaned before use. Symptoms are found around the body parts that sit in the hot tubâ€”typically the legs, hips, buttocks, and surrounding areas. Symptoms are typically amplified around regions that were covered by wet clothing, such as bathing suits. Rashid R, Hymes S.Dermatol Online J. 2009 May 15;15(5):16.
