 Sticky platelet syndrome is a term used by some to describe a disorder of platelet function. It was first described by Mammen in 1983. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It has not been associated with a specific gene, and it is not recognized as an entity in OMIM. Among researchers using the term, it has been described as a coagulation disorder that can present in conjunction with protein S deficiency and Factor V Leiden. It is not currently known if sticky platelet syndrome is a distinct condition, or if it represents part of the presentation of a more well characterized coagulation disorder. SPS is diagnosed by demonstrating platelet hyperaggregability. In a lab test called aggregometry platelet stickyness is stimulated with epinephrine (EPI) and/or adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This test is not possible for patients being treated with acetylsalicylic acid until that substance has sufficiently cleared from their system. Those diagnosed are usually treated with taking a low dose (80–100 mg) Aspirin a day. Anticoagulants (e.g. Warfarin, Coumadin or Plavix) are often additionally prescribed following formation of a medically significant clot. Thrombelastography is more commonly being used to diagnose hypercoagulability and monitor anti-platelet therapy. Critics of the diagnosis complain that case evidence is spotty and lacking controlled clinical studies.
