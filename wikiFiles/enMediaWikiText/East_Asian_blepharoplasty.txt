 Asian blepharoplasty, also known as "double eyelid surgery", is a type of cosmetic surgery where the skin around the eye is reshaped (blepharoplasty). The purpose of the procedure is to create an upper eyelid with a crease (i.e. "double eyelid") from an eyelid that is naturally without a crease (a.k.a. "single eyelid"). Anatomically, there are a number of subtle differences in the upper eyelids of many Asians particularly from East, North and Central Asia, as well as many Native Americans, compared with the differences in the eyelids of other races. While there are some Asians with a double eyelid and some without, there is also a large variation in the crease position (double eyelid size) of the East Asian upper eyelid. The upper lid fold can range from 1 mm above the eyelash line to about 10 mm. Several methods can be used to create the double eyelid — including the full-incisional, partial incision and no incision methods (e.g. the DST method). Each has its advantages depending on the patient's anatomy and desires. Asian blepharoplasties have been reported to be the most common aesthetic procedure in Taiwan, South Korea and other parts of East Asia. The procedure has been reported to have some risk of complications, but is generally quite safe if done by an expert plastic surgeon. Practitioners of Asian double eyelid surgery include plastic surgeons (facial plastic and reconstructive surgeons), otolaryngologists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and ophthalmologists (oculoplastic surgeons). A procedure to remove the epicanthal fold (i.e. an epicanthoplasty) is often performed in conjunction with an Asian blepharoplasty. The procedure to alter the natural Asian "single eyelid" appearance has been a subject of controversy, and described by opponents of the procedure, such as author David Mura, as being "indoctrinated by white standards of beauty"
