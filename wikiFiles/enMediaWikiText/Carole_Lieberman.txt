 Carole Lieberman M.D. of Beverly Hills, California was born and raised in New York City. Lieberman received her Medical Degree from Belgium's Université catholique de Louvain and received her psychiatric residency training at New York University, Bellevue, where she was Chief Resident. She also studied in London at Anna Freud's Hampstead Clinic and at the Institute of Psychiatry/Maudsley Hospital. She is a diplomate of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, and a member of the clinical faculty at UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute. Lieberman worked on the research team and closely with Principal Investigator Michael S Goldstein Ph.D on the NIMH funded grant research training on mental health epidemiology which discussed in part how to use the media for public health education. Lieberman has a Masters Degree in Public Health from the University of California, Los Angeles. She was featured on a segment on CNN about a boy named Andrew, 13, who was charged with more than 120 felonies, and stated: "If Andrew were to get intensive treatment including psychotherapy and medication he could be saved, but realistically I don’t think that will happen. This kid is going to jail, and then he’s going to hell." Lieberman is the author of Bad Boys: Why We Love Them, How to Live with Them, and When to Leave Them, and more recently Bad Girls: Why Men Love Them & How Good Girls Can Learn Their Secrets. In 2006 she authored Coping With Terrorism: Dreams Interrupted published by European Atlantic Publications. {{Persondata | NAME =Lieberman, Carole | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION =US psychiatrist | DATE OF BIRTH =| PLACE OF BIRTH = New York City | DATE OF DEATH =| PLACE OF DEATH =}}
