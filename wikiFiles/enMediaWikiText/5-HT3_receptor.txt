 {{DISPLAYTITLE:5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor}} The 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor is a member of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, a superfamily that also includes the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and the inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors for GABA (both GABA<SUB>A</SUB> and GABA<sub>A</sub>-œÅ receptors) and glycine. The 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor is most closely related by homology to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor consists of 5 subunits arranged around a central ion conducting pore, which is permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium ions. Binding of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) to the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor opens the channel, which, in turn, leads to an excitatory response in neurons. The 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor differs markedly in structure and mechanism from the other 5-HT receptor subtypes, which are all G-protein-coupled. As with other ligand gated ion channels, the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor is composed of five subunits pseudo symmetrically arranged about a central ion conducting pore. These subunits are proteins encoded by the , , , , and/or genes. A functional channel may be composed of five identical 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> subunits (homopentameric) or a mixture of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> and one of the other four 5-HT<sub>3B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3D</sub>, or 5-HT<sub>3E</sub> subunits (heteropentameric). It appears that only the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> subunits form functional homopentameric channels. All other subunit subtypes must heteropentamerize with 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> subunits to form functional channels. The 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor is expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems and mediates a variety of physiological functions. On a cellular level, it has been shown that postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission in rat neocortical interneurons, amygdala, and hippocampus, and in ferret visual cortex. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are also present on presynaptic nerve terminals, where they are thought to mediate or modulate neurotransmitter release. When the receptor is activated to open the ion channel by agonists, the following effects are observed: Agonists for the receptor include: Antagonists for the receptor (sorted by their respective therapeutic application) include: Identification of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor did not take place until 1986 because of a lack of selective pharmacological tool. However, with the discovery that the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor plays a prominent role in chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced vomiting, and the concomitant development of selective 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists to suppress these side effects aroused intense interest from the pharmaceutical industry and therefore the identification of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in cell lines and native tissues quickly followed.
