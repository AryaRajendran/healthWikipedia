 Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is a condition that results in a mild impairment of the cell's ability to respond to androgens. The degree of impairment is sufficient to impair spermatogenesis and / or the development of secondary sexual characteristics at puberty in males, but does not affect genital differentiation or development. Female genital and sexual development is not significantly affected by the insensitivity to androgens; as such, MAIS is only diagnosed in males. The clinical phenotype associated with MAIS is a normal male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect and / or reduced secondary terminal hair. MAIS is one of three types of androgen insensitivity syndrome, which is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is that of a normal female, mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is that of a normal male, and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is partially, but not fully masculinized. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is the largest single entity that leads to 46,XY undermasculinization. Individuals with mild (or minimal) androgen insensitivity syndrome (grade 1 on the Quigley scale) are born phenotypically male, with fully masculinized genitalia; this category of androgen insensitivity is diagnosed when the degree of androgen insensitivity in an individual with a 46,XY karyotype is great enough to impair virilization or spermatogenesis, but is not great enough to impair normal male genital development. MAIS is the mildest and least known form of androgen insensitivity syndrome. The existence of a variant of androgen insensitivity that solely affected spermatogenesis was theoretical at first. Cases of phenotypically normal males with isolated spermatogenic defect due to AR mutation were first detected as the result of male infertility evaluations. Until then, early evidence in support of the existence of MAIS was limited to cases involving a mild defect in virilization, although some of these early cases made allowances for some degree of impairment of genital masculinization, such as hypospadias or micropenis. It is estimated that 2-3% of infertile men have AR gene mutations. Examples of MAIS phenotypes include isolated infertility (oligospermia or azoospermia), mild gynecomastia in young adulthood, decreased secondary terminal hair, high pitched voice, or minor hypospadias repair in childhood.<ref name="2002 zenteno 57" /> The external male genitalia (penis, scrotum, and urethra) are otherwise normal in individuals with MAIS.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2003 lund 79" /> Internal genitalia, including Wolffian structures (the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles) and the prostate, is also normal, although the bitesticular volume of infertile men (both with and without MAIS) is diminished <ref name="2006 ferlin 65" />; male infertility is associated with reduced bitesticular volume, varicocele, retractile testes, low ejaculate volume, male accessory gland infections (MAGI), and mumps orchitis.<ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /> The incidence of these features in infertile men with MAIS is similar to that of infertile men without MAIS.<ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /> MAIS is not associated with Müllerian remnants. Kennedy disease, also known as spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is a severe neurodegenerative syndrome that is associated with a particular mutation of the androgen receptor's polyglutamine tract called a trinucleotide repeat expansion.<ref name="2001 casella 58" /><ref name="2002 dejager 87" /> SBMA results when the length of the polyglutamine tract exceeds 40 repetitions.<ref name="1991 la spada 352" /> Although technically a variant of MAIS, SBMA's presentation is not typical of androgen insensitivity; symptoms do not occur until adulthood and include neuromuscular defects as well as signs of androgen inaction.<ref name="2001 casella 58" /> Neuromuscular symptoms include progressive proximal muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations. Symptoms of androgen insensitivity experienced by men with SBMA are also progressive <ref name="2001 casella 58" /> and include testicular atrophy, severe oligospermia or azoospermia, gynecomastia, and feminized skin changes <ref name="1983 arbizu 59" /> despite elevated androgen levels.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> Disease onset, which usually affects the proximal musculature first, occurs in the third to fifth decades of life, and is often preceded by muscular cramps on exertion, tremor of the hands, and elevated muscle creatine kinase.<ref name="1998 choong 21" /> SBMA is often misdiagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease).<ref name="2002 dejager 87" /> The symptoms of SBMA are thought to be brought about by two simultaneous pathways involving the toxic misfolding of proteins and loss of AR functionality.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> The polyglutamine tract in affected pedigrees tends to increase in length over generations, a phenomenon known as "anticipation",<ref name="1992 biancalana 1" /> leading to an increase in the severity of the disease as well as a decrease in the age of onset for each subsequent generation of a family affected by SBMA.<ref name="2001 casella 58" /> All forms of androgen insensitivity are associated with infertility, though exceptions have been reported for both the mild and partial forms.<ref name="2002 giwercman 87" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /><ref name="2002 chu 87" /><ref name="2005 menakaya 25" /><ref name="2000 giwercman 85" /> Lifespan is not thought to be affected by AIS.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> The androgen receptor gene contains two polymorphic trinucleotide microsatellites in exon 1.<ref name="2008 galani 7" /> The first microsatellite (nearest the 5' end) contains 8 <ref name="1999 kooy 85" /> to 60 <ref name="2002 dejager 87" /><ref name="1998 choong 21" /> repetitions of the glutamine codon "CAG" and is thus known as the polyglutamine tract.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> The second microsatellite contains 4 <ref name="2010 audi 95" /> to 31 <ref name="1997 lumbroso 101" /> repetitions of the glycine codon "GGC" and is known as the polyglycine tract.<ref name="1999 gottlieb 89" /> The average number of repetitions varies by ethnicity, with Caucasians exhibiting an average of 21 CAG repeats, and Blacks 18.<ref name="1992 edwards 12" /> Disease states are associated with extremes in polyglutamine tract length; prostate cancer,<ref name="2001 casella 58" /> hepatocellular carcinoma,<ref name="2007 yeh 120" /> and mental retardation <ref name="1999 kooy 85" /> are associated with too few repetitions, while spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is associated with a CAG repetition length of 40 or more.<ref name="1991 la spada 352" /> Some studies indicate that the length of the polyglutamine tract is inversely correlated with transcriptional activity in the AR protein, and that longer polyglutamine tracts may be associated with infertility <ref name="2003 casella 169" /><ref name="1999 dowsing 354" /><ref name="1997 tut 82" /> and undermasculinized genitalia.<ref name="2000 lim 9" /> However, other studies have indicated that no such correlation exists.<ref name="2000 hiort 85" /><ref name="2002 kukuvitis 25" /><ref name="2001 von eckardstein 86" /><ref name="2002 rajpert-de meyts 359" /><ref name="1999 hiort 354" /><ref name="2001 muroya 7" /> A comprehensive meta-analysis of the subject published in 2007 supports the existence of the correlation, and concluded that these discrepancies could be resolved when sample size and study design are taken into account.<ref name="2007 davis-dao 92" /> Longer polyglycine tract lengths have also been associated with genital masculinization defects in some,<ref name="2007 radpour 28" /><ref name="2004 aschim 89" /> but not all,<ref name="2006 rajender 27" /> studies. MAIS is only diagnosed in normal phenotypic males, and is not typically investigated except in cases of male infertility.<ref name="2008 oakes 21" /> MAIS has a mild presentation that often goes unnoticed and untreated <ref name="1989 pinsky 32" />; even with semenological, clinical and laboratory data, it can be difficult to distinguish between men with and without MAIS, and thus a diagnosis of MAIS is not usually made without confirmation of an AR gene mutation.<ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /> The androgen sensitivity index (ASI), defined as the product of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (T), is frequently raised in individuals with all forms of AIS, including MAIS, although many individuals with MAIS have an ASI in the normal range.<ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /> Testosterone levels may be elevated despite normal levels of luteinizing hormone.<ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /><ref name="1988 grino 66" /><ref name="2002 zenteno 57" /> Conversion of testosterone (T) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) may be impaired, although to a lesser extent than is seen in 5α-reductase deficiency.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> A high ASI in a normal phenotypic male,<ref name="2000 hiort 85" /> especially when combined with azoospermia or oligospermia,<ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /> decreased secondary terminal hair,<ref name="2002 dejager 87" /> and/or impaired conversion of T to DHT, <ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> can be indicative of MAIS, and may warrant genetic testing. Due to its mild presentation, MAIS often goes unnoticed and untreated.<ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /> Management of MAIS is currently limited to symptomatic management; methods to correct a malfunctioning androgen receptor protein that result from an AR gene mutation are not currently available. Treatment includes surgical correction of mild gynecomastia, minor hypospadias repair, and testosterone supplementation.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /><ref name="1994 yong 344" /> Supraphysiological doses of testosterone have been shown to correct diminished secondary sexual characteristics in men with MAIS,<ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /> as well as to reverse infertility due to low sperm count.<ref name="1994 yong 344" /><ref name="2006 hughes 91" /> As is the case with PAIS, men with MAIS will experience side effects from androgen therapy (such as the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis) at a higher dosage than unaffected men. Careful monitoring is required to ensure the safety and efficacy of treatment.<ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /><ref name="1998 weidemann 83" /><ref name="1997 tincello 46" /> Regular breast <ref name="1998 weidemann 83" /> and prostate <ref name="2006 nieschlag 65" /> examinations may be necessary due to comorbid association with breast and prostate cancers.
