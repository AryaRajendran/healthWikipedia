 The extensor digiti minimi (extensor digiti quinti proprius) is a slender muscle of the forearm, placed on the ulnar side of the Extensor digitorum communis, with which it is generally connected. It arises from the common Extensor tendon by a thin tendinous slip, from the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. Its tendon runs through a compartment of the dorsal carpal ligament behind the distal radio-ulnar joint, then divides into two as it crosses the hand, and finally joins the expansion of the Extensor digitorum communis tendon on the dorsum of the first phalanx of the little finger. The extensor digiti minimi originates from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, or the outer edge of the elbow if the palm is facing up, in the anatomical position. It runs along the back of the back of the arm to the wrist and past the wrist to the proximal phalanx V, or the bone between the knuckle and first bend of the finger of the little finger. The extensor digiti minimi is a two joint muscle. It acts as an extensor in both joints. It extends the wrist, which means it moves the back of the hand toward the back of the forarm. It also extends the little finger, which means it straightens the little finger from a fist. An additional fibrous slip from the lateral epicondyle; the tendon of insertion may not divide or may send a slip to the ring finger. Absence of muscle rare; fusion of the belly with the Extensor digitorum communis not uncommon. Variations to the 5th extensor compartment, which the extensor digiti minimi runs through, may cause tenosynovitis and can limit the use of the extensor digiti minimi. Extensor digiti minimi can also be bifurcated, which means split, at many different points in the muscle. File:Slide13TTTT.JPG| Extensor digiti minimi muscleFile:Slide1MAM.JPG|Muscles of hand.
