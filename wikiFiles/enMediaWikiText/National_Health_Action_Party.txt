 The National Health Action Party (NHA) is a political party in England. Founded by former MP Dr Richard Taylor and cancer specialist and chair of the NHS Consultants Association Dr Clive Peedell in May 2012, the party seeks to campaign against changes to the English National Health Service. The party also intends to follow the recommendations of the Health Select Committee's 2009/10 reports, and campaign on deprivation, housing, and public health. The party supports the Dilnot report's recommendations on social care, and believes the Francis report has failed to address key problems, such as whistleblower protection and the effect of NHS reforms. The party intends to fight in a number of constituencies at the next general election, with the aim of replacing MPs who favoured the Health and Social Care Bill as well as having significant influence in the event of a hung parliament. The party plans a social media campaign and attended the Netroots conference in June 2012. The party was formally launched on 15 November 2012 with a press conference at Methodist Central Hall Westminster. Peedell said that the party aims to win 50 seats at the next general election, and was seen as putting pressure on the Labour Party to "repeal the NHS bill".
