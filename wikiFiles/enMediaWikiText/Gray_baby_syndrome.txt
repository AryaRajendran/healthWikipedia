 Gray baby syndrome (also termed Gray or Grey syndrome) is a rare but serious side effect that occurs in newborn infants (especially premature babies) following the intravenous administration of the antimicrobial chloramphenicol. Two pathophysiologic mechanisms are thought to play a role in the development of gray baby syndrome after exposure to the anti-microbial drug chloramphenicol. This condition is due to a lack of glucuronidation reactions occurring in the baby, thus leading to an accumulation of toxic chloramphenicol metabolites. : Toxic levels of chloramphenicol after 2â€“9 days result in: Chloramphenicol therapy is discontinued immediately; exchange transfusion may be required to remove the drug. Sometimes, phenobarbital (UGT induction) is used. The condition can be prevented by using chloramphenicol at the recommended doses and monitoring blood levels, or alternatively, third generation cephalosporins can be effectively substituted for the drug, without the associated toxicity.
