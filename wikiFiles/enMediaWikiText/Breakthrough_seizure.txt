 A breakthrough seizure is an epileptic seizure that occurs despite the use of anticonvulsants that have otherwise successfully prevented seizures in the patient. Breakthrough seizures may be more dangerous than non-breakthrough seizures because are unexpected by the patient, who may have considered himself or herself free from seizures and therefore, not take any precautions. Breakthrough seizures are more likely given the intensity and number of triggers. Often when a breakthrough seizure occurs in a person whose seizures have always been well controlled, there is a new underlying cause to the seizure. Causes of a breakthrough seizure include: Rates of breakthrough seizures vary. Studies have shown the rates of breakthrough seizures ranging from 11â€“37%. The treatment for a breakthrough seizure involves measuring the level of the anticonvulsant in the patient's system, and may include increasing the dosage of the existing medication, adding another medication in addition to the existing one, or altogether switching medications. One who suffers a breakthrough seizure when he or she is not known to have them may require hospitalization for a period of time for observation.
