 The New York University School of Medicine is one of the graduate schools of New York University. Founded in 1841 as the University Medical College, the NYU School of Medicine is one of the foremost medical schools in the United States, ranking 21st in research according to [[U.S. News & World Report]]. The School of Medicine is part of NYU Langone Medical Center, named after Kenneth Langone, the investment banker and financial backer of the Home Depot. It is located at 550 First Avenue in New York City. The School of Medicine has 1,177 full-time faculty and 3,091 part-time faculty. Additionally, there are 104 endowed professorships, 1,078 residents/fellows, 68 M.D./Ph.D. candidates and 400 postdoctoral fellows . The NYU Medical Center is home to the School of Medicine, the Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, and the Charles C. Harris Skin & Cancer Pavilion, considered one of the most prestigious dermatology institutes in the United States. In 2012-13, NYU Langone Medical Center was recognized on the U.S. News & World Report "Best Hospitals Honor Roll," ranking 11th among the top hospitals in the nation with 13 nationally ranked specialties including cancer, cardiology & heart surgery, neurology & neurosurgery, orthopedics, diabetes & endocrinology, nephrology, geriatrics, gastroenterology, ear, nose & throat, rehabilitation, pulmonology, rheumatology, and urology. New York University School of Medicine has recently implemented the curriculum for the 21st century. The new curriculum consists of 18 months of basic science and two and a half years of clinical training. Students take the USMLE Step 1 exam after the clerkship year (with the exception of MD/PhD students, who take it before starting their PhD work). This allows students additional time to take electives, conduct research, or go on away rotations. Other features of the curriculum include NYU3T (a joint program with the New York University College of Nursing) and PLACE (Patient-Based Longitudinal Ambulatory Care Experience). The NYU School of Medicine also offers several 5-year joint degree programs, some of which can be optionally completed in 4 years.: Since 1964, NYU School of Medicine has offered MD/PhD dual degree training through the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). Admission to NYU School of Medicine is one of the most selective in the country. For the Class of 2016, NYU received 8,351 applications and interviewed 968 applicants for a class of 158 medical students. The matriculating class had an average GPA of 3.84 and an average MCAT score of 34Q. The main NYU Langone Medical Center campus is located at the East River waterfront at 1st Ave. between 30th and 34th street. It hosts the NYU School of Medicine, Tisch Hospital and the Howard A. Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine. Other NYU Langone Medical Center facilities across the city include the Hospital for Joint Diseases Orthopaedic Institute, the NYU Cancer Center on 34th Street, and Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn. NYU Langone Medical Center also has a long-standing affiliation with the Bellevue Hospital, NYU's principal teaching hospital, of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and with the Manhattan Veteran's Affairs Hospital. Most recently, the NYU School of Medicine opened a new emergency simulation center at Bellevue Hospital in a joint effort with the City University of New York. Medical students, nurses, EMTs, and other medical staff will be able to practice and refine their skills on state-of-the-art mannequins, as well as actors playing standardized patients. Research facilities include the Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences and the Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine. New York University College of Medicine was established in 1841. The medical school merged with Bellevue Medical College in 1898 to form the University and Bellevue Hospital Medical College. The present name was adopted in 1960. The NYU School of Medicine is home to many key advancements in medical education. In 1854, human dissection in New York was legalized due to efforts of the faculty. In 1884, the Carnegie Laboratory, the first facility in the U.S. devoted to teaching and research in bacteriology and pathology, was established at NYU. In 1932, the first department of forensic medicine in the U.S. was established at NYU. In 1941, NYU opened the first department of physical medicine and rehabilitation in the U.S. The Institute and Department of Environmental Medicine were established in 1964. In 1980, NYU professor Saul Krugman, M.D., developed the first vaccine against hepatitis B. In 1866, NYU professors produced a report for the Council of Hygiene and Public Health which led to establishment of New York City's Health Department. The same year, NYU opened the first outpatient clinic in the United States. In 1872, NYU Professor Steven Smith founded the American Public Health Association. In 1899, NYU graduate Walter Reed discovered the mosquito transmission of yellow fever. The 1993 construction of the Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine is the largest building project in history of NYU. During World War II, NYU College of Medicine was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. In 1998, the Mount Sinai-NYU Health System was established when the NYU Medical System merged with Mount Sinai Hospitals. The joint organization included Mount Sinai Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital of Queens, Tisch Hospital, Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, Hospital for Joint Diseases Orthopaedic Institute, NYU Downtown Hospital, and Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The merger made NYU the only private university in the country with two medical schools. The union dissolved in 2003 while confronting a shared debt of $665.6 million, but NYU continued to award Mount Sinai's degrees. In 2010, however, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine was accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and became an independent degree-granting institution without a university affiliation for the first time in its history. 1841: The New York University College of Medicine opens, ten years after the founding of the university.
