 Weber's syndrome (superior alternating hemiplegia) is a form of stroke characterized by the presence of an oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia. This lesion is usually unilateral and affects several structures in the midbrain including: Structure damaged Effect substantia nigra contralateral parkinsonism because its dopaminergic projections to the basal ganglia innervate the ipsilateral hemisphere motor field, leading to a movement disorder of the contralateral body. corticospinal fibers contralateral hemiparesis and typical upper motor neuron findings. It is contralateral because it occurs before the decussation in the medulla. corticobulbar tract difficulty with contralateral lower facial muscles and hypoglossal nerve functions oculomotor nerve fibers ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy with a drooping eyelid and fixed wide pupil pointed down and out. This leads to diplopia It is caused by midbrain infarction as a result of occlusion of the paramedian branches of the posterior cerebral artery or of basilar bifurcation perforating arteries. It carries the name of Sir Hermann David Weber, a German-born physician working in London, who described the condition in 1863. It is unrelated to Sturge-Weber syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome.
