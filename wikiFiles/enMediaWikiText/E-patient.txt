 An e-patient (also known as Internet patient, or Internet-savvy patient) is a health consumer who uses the Internet to gather information about a medical condition of particular interest to them, and who use electronic communication tools (including Web 2.0 tools) in coping with medical conditions. The term encompasses both those who seek online guidance for their own ailments and the friends and family members (e-Caregivers) who go online on their behalf. e-Patients report two effects of their online health research: "better health information and services, and different (but not always better) relationships with their doctors." As use of the term e-Patient has evolved, there has been less emphasis on Internet access and technology, and a contention that the "e" in "e-patient" stands for "empowered, engaged, equipped, enabled." e-Patients are increasingly active in their care and are demonstrating the power of the Participatory Medicine or Health 2.0 / Medicine 2.0. model of care. They are equipped, enabled, empowered, engaged, equals, emancipated and experts. Based on the current state of knowledge on the impact of e-patients on the healthcare system and the quality of care received: The proportion of e-patients in selected patient populations seem to be highest in the US and Canada. European countries seem to lag.
