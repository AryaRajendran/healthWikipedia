 For a more comprehensive overview of Array CGH techniques and applications refer to Comparative genomic hybridization#Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization. Array-comparative genomic hybridization (also CMA, Chromosomal microarray analysis, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization, array CGH, a-CGH, aCGH) is a technique to detect genomic copy number variations at a higher resolution level than chromosome-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). It can be used to create a virtual karyotype. DNA from a test sample and normal reference sample are labelled differentially, using different fluorophores, and hybridized to several thousand probes. The probes are derived from most of the known genes and non-coding regions of the genome, printed on a glass slide. The fluorescence intensity of the test and of the reference DNA is then measured, to calculate the ratio between them and subsequently the copy number changes for a particular location in the genome. Using this method, copy number changes at a level of 5â€“10 kilobases of DNA sequences can be detected. , even high-resolution CGH (HR-CGH) arrays are accurate to detect structural variations (SV) at resolution of 200 bp. This method allows one to identify new recurrent chromosome changes such as microdeletions and duplications in human conditions such as cancer and birth defects due to chromosome aberrations. There are several requirements that are dependent on the application of aCGH:
