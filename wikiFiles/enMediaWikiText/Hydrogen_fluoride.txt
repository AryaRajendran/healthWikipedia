 Hydrogen fluoride is a chemical compound with the formula HF. This colorless gas is the principal industrial source of fluorine, often in the aqueous form as hydrofluoric acid, and thus is the precursor to many important compounds including pharmaceuticals and polymers (e.g. Teflon). HF is widely used in the petrochemical industry and is a component of many superacids. Hydrogen fluoride boils just below room temperature whereas the other hydrogen halides condense at much lower temperatures. Unlike the other hydrogen halides, HF is lighter than air and diffuses relatively quickly through porous substances. Hydrogen fluoride is a highly dangerous gas, forming corrosive and penetrating hydrofluoric acid upon contact with tissue. The gas can also cause blindness by rapid destruction of the corneas. <br clear = left/>Near or above room temperature, HF is a colorless gas. Below , HF forms orthorhombic crystals, consisting of zig-zag chains of HF molecules. The HF molecules, with a short H–F bond of 95 pm, are linked to neighboring molecules by intermolecular H–F distances of 155 pm. Liquid HF also consists of chains of HF molecules, but the chains are shorter, consisting on average of only five or six molecules. The higher boiling point of HF relative to analogous species, such as HCl, is attributed to hydrogen bonding between HF molecules, as indicated by the existence of chains even in the liquid state. The acidity of hydrofluoric acid solutions vary with concentration owing to hydrogen-bond interactions of the fluoride ion. Dilute solutions are weakly acidic with an acid ionization constant K<sub>a</sub> = 6.6 (or pK<sub>a</sub> = 3.18), in contrast to corresponding solutions of the other hydrogen halides which are strong acids. Concentrated solutions of hydrogen fluoride are much more strongly acid than implied by this value, as shown by measurements of the Hammett acidity function H<sub>0</sub> (or “effective pH”). For 100%, HF has an H<sub>0</sub>, estimated to be between −10.2 and −11, which is comparable to the value −12 for sulfuric acid. In thermodynamic terms, HF solutions are highly non-ideal, with the activity of HF increasing much more rapidly than its concentration. The weak acidity in dilute solution is sometimes attributed to the high H—F bond strength, which combines with the high dissolution enthalpy of HF to outweigh the more negative enthalpy of hydration of the fluoride ion. However, Giguère and Turrell have shown by infrared spectroscopy that the predominant solute species is the hydrogen-bonded ion-pair [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>•F<sup>−</sup>], which suggests that the ionization can be described as a double equilibrium: The first equilibrium to the right and the second to the left, meaning that HF is extensively dissociated, but that the tight ion pairs reduce the thermodynamic activity coefficient of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, so that the solution is effectively less acidic. In concentrated solution, the additional HF causes the ion pair to dissociate with formation of the hydrogen-bonded hydrogen difluoride ion. The increase in free H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> due to this reaction accounts for the rapid increase in acidity, while fluoride ions are stabilized (and become less basic) by strong hydrogen bonding to HF to form HF<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>. This interaction between the acid and its own conjugate base is an example of homoconjugation. At the limit of 100% liquid HF, there is autoionization that forms an extremely acidic solution (H0 = −11). The acidity of anhydrous HF can be increased even further by the addition of Lewis acids such as SbF<sub>5</sub>, which can reduce H<sub>0</sub> to −21. Hydrogen fluoride is produced as by the action of sulfuric acid on pure grades of the mineral fluorite and also as a side-product of the extraction of the fertilizer precursor phosphoric acid from various minerals. See also hydrofluoric acid. The anhydrous compound hydrogen fluoride is more commonly used than its aqueous solution, hydrofluoric acid. HF serves as a catalyst in alkylation processes in oil refineries. A component of high-octane gasoline called "alkylate" is generated in Alkylation units that combine C3 and C4 olefins and isobutane to generate gasoline. HF is a reactive solvent in the electrochemical fluorination of organic compounds. In this approach, HF is oxidized in the presence of a hydrocarbon and the fluorine replaces C–H bonds with C–F bonds. Perfluorinated carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids are produced in this way. Hydrogen fluoride is an important catalyst used in the majority of the installed linear alkyl benzene production in the world. The process involves dehydrogenation of n-paraffins to olefins, and subsequent reaction with benzene using HF as catalyst. Elemental fluorine, F<sub>2</sub>, is prepared by electrolysis of a solution of HF and potassium bifluoride. The potassium bifluoride is needed because anhydrous hydrogen fluoride does not conduct electricity. Several million kilograms of F<sub>2</sub> are produced annually. Acyl chlorides or acid anhydrides react with hydrogen fluoride to give acyl fluorides. HF is often used in palynology to remove silicate minerals, for extraction of dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs and chitinozoans. 1,1-Difluoroethane is produced by the mercury-catalyzed addition of hydrogen fluoride to acetylene: The intermediate in this process is vinyl fluoride, the monomeric percursor to polyvinyl fluoride. Upon contact with moisture, including tissue, hydrogen fluoride immediately converts to hydrofluoric acid, which is highly corrosive and toxic, and requires immediate medical attention upon exposure.
