 The Revised Trauma Score (RTS) is a physiologic scoring system, designed for use in based on the initial vital signs of a patient. A lower score indicates a higher severity of injury. The Revised Trauma Score is made up of a three categories: Glasgow Coma Scale, Systolic blood pressure, and respiratory rate. The score range is 0-12. In START triage, a patient with an RTS score of 12 is labeled delayed, 11 is urgent , and 10-3 is immediate. Those who have an RTS below 3 are declared dead and should not receive certain care because they are highly unlikely to survive without a significant amount of resources. The score is as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale GCS Points 15-13 4 12-9 3 8-6 2 5-4 1 3 0 Systolic Pressure SBP Points >89||4 76-89 3 50-75 2 1-49 1 0 0 Respiratory Rate RR Points 10-29 4 >29||3 6-9 2 1-5 1 0 0
