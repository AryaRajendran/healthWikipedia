 Ventouse is a vacuum device used to assist the delivery of a baby when the second stage of labour has not progressed adequately. It is an alternative to a forceps delivery and caesarean section. It cannot be used when the baby is in the breech position or for premature births. This technique is also called vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery or vacuum extraction (VE). The use of VE is generally safe, but it can occasionally have negative effects on either the mother and the child. The woman is placed in the lithotomy position and assists throughout the process by pushing. A suction cup is placed onto the head of the baby and the suction draws the skin from the scalp into the cup. Correct placement of the cup directly over the flexion point, about 3Â cm anterior from the occipital (posterior) fontanelle, is critical to the success of a VE. Ventouse devices have handles to allow for traction. When the baby's head is delivered, the device is detached, allowing the accoucheur and the mother to complete the delivery of the baby. For proper use of the ventouse, the maternal cervix has to be fully dilated, the head engaged in the birth canal, and the head position known. If the ventouse attempt fails, it may be necessary to deliver the infant by forceps or caesarean section. There are several indications to use a ventouse to aid delivery:
