 The International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) is a domain specific extension of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems for tumor diseases. This classification is widely used by cancer registries. It is currently in its third revision (ICD-O-3). ICD-10 includes a list of morphology codes. They stem from ICD-O second edition (ICD-O-2) that was valid at the time of publication. The classification has two axes: topography and morphology The morphology axis is for the morphology of the tumor. This axis has particular importance because the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine ("SNOMED") has adopted the ICD-O classification of morphology. SNOMED has been changing continuously, and several different versions of SNOMED are in use. Accordingly, mapping of ICD-O codes to SNOMED requires careful assessment of whether entities are indeed true matches. (8000–8009) Not otherwise specified (8010–8790) Epithelial (8800–9370) Connective tissue (9380–9589) Nervous system (9590–9999) Hematologic (Leukemias, Lymphomas and related disorders) -- Lymphoid leukemias, and related conditions -- Myeloid leukemias, and related conditions -- Other The topography axis is for the topographical codes of the tumor's site. It is standardized with the C section of ICD-10 There were no changes in the topography axis between ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3. See List of ICD-10 codes#(C00–C97) Malignant Neoplasms for examples.
