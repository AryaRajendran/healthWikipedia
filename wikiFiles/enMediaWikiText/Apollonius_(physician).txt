 Apollonius was the name of several physicians in the time of Ancient Greece and Rome: Another physician of this name, who is mentioned by Apuleius, as having been bitten by a mad dog, must (if he ever really existed) have lived in the 2nd century AD. The name occurs in several ancient authors, belonging to one or more physicians, without any distinguishing epithet.
