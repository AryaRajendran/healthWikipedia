 This table gives an overview of the pathology seen in myocardial infarction by time after obstruction. For the first ~30 minutes no change at all can be seen by gross examination or by light microscopy in histopathology. However, in electron microscopy relaxed myofibrils, as well as glycogen loss and mitochondrial swelling can be seen. Time !! Gross examination !! Histopathology (light microscopy) 0 - 0.5 hours None None 0.5 – 4 hours None 4 – 12 hours 12 – 24 hours 1 – 3 days 3 – 7 days 7 – 10 days 10 – 34 days 2 – 8 weeks More than 2 months Completed scarring Dense collagenous scar formed If not else specified in boxes, then reference is nr Once scarring is completed, there is yet no common method of telling the actual age of the infarct, since e.g. a scar that is four months old looks identical to a scar that is ten years old.
