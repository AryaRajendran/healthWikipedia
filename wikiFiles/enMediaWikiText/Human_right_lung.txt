 The human right lung is divided into three lobes (as opposed to two lobes on the left), superior, middle, and inferior, by two interlobular fissures: The middle lobe, the smallest lobe of the right lung, is wedge-shaped, and includes the part of the anterior border and the anterior part of the base of the lung. (There is no middle lobe on the left lung, though there is a lingula.) The superior and inferior lobes are similar to their counterparts on the left lung. The right lung has a higher volume, total capacity and weight, than that of the left lung. This is despite being 5cm shorter due to the diaphragm rising higher on the right side to accommodate the liver. The right lung is also broader than the left, owing to the inclination of the heart to the left side. On the mediastinal surface, immediately above the hilum, is an arched furrow which accommodates the azygos vein; while running superiorly, and then arching laterally some little distance below the apex, is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and right innominate vein; behind this, and proximal to the apex, is a furrow for the innominate artery. Behind the hilum and the attachment of the pulmonary ligament is a vertical groove for the esophagus; this groove becomes less distinct below, owing to the inclination of the lower part of the esophagus to the left of the middle line. In front and to the right of the lower part of the esophageal groove is a deep concavity for the extrapericardiac portion of the thoracic part of the inferior vena cava.
