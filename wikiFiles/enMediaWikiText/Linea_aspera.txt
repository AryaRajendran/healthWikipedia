 The linea aspera (L. rough line) is a ridge of roughened surface on the posterior aspect of the femur, to which are attached muscles and intermuscular septum. Its margins diverge above and below. The linea aspera is a prominent longitudinal ridge or crest, on the middle third of the bone, presenting a medial and a lateral lip, and a narrow rough, intermediate line. It is an important insertion point for the adductors and the intermuscular septa that divides the thigh into three compartments. The tension generated by muscle attached to the bones is responsible for the formation of the ridges. Above, the linea aspera is prolonged by three ridges. Below, the linea aspera is prolonged into two ridges, enclosing between them a triangular area, the popliteal surface, upon which the popliteal artery rests. The linea aspera is perforated a little below its center by the nutrient canal, which is directed obliquely upward.
