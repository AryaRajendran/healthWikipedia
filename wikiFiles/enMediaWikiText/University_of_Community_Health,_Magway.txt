 The University of Community Health, Magway (UCH) (, ) is a public university located in Magway, Myanmar. The university offers a four-year Bachelor of Community Health (B.Comm.H.) degree program. The graduates are allowed to practice as health assistants, many of whom are the main providers of primary health care in rural Myanmar where access to regular physicians is difficult. UCH was founded as the Health Assistant Training School in 1951 in Yangon to provide health care to rural population. The school was moved a few kilometers north to Insein in 1963, and then to Hlegu in 1968. In 1989, the school came under the purview of the Ministry of Health. The school became the Institute of Community Health in 1991, and became a university in 1995 and began offering a four-year bachelor's degree program. In 1999, the military government moved the school out of Yangon Division to Upper Myanmar. UCH is located on a 41.4-hectare campus at Htonpauk, about 14.5 km north of Magway, and 3.2 km off the Magway-Natmauk Road. Each school year lasts ten months from January to October. Students are required to take written and oral exams at the end of each year. First year students are required to interact with the community by meeting the patients from nearby villages. Third year students are required to make field trips to nearby villages and provide seminars on such health education topics as the natural history of diseases, environmental sanitation, the dangers of smoking/alcohol, rodent control, etc. The seminars are organized by the departments of Health Education, Community Health and Environmental Health. The students then visit a local Rural Health Center (RHC) to learn the operations of an RHC.
