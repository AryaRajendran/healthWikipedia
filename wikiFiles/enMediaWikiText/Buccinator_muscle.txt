 The buccinator () is a thin quadrilateral muscle, occupying the interval between the maxilla and the mandible at the side of the face. Its purpose is to pull back the angle of the mouth and to flatten the cheek area, which aids in holding the cheek to the teeth during chewing. It aids whistling and smiling, and in neonates it is used to suckle. It arises from the outer surfaces of the alveolar processes of the maxilla and mandible, corresponding to the three pairs of molar teeth; and behind, from the anterior border of the pterygomandibular raph√© which separates it from the constrictor pharyngis superior. The fibers converge toward the angle of the mouth, where the central fibers intersect each other, those from below being continuous with the upper segment of the orbicularis oris, and those from above with the lower segment; the upper and lower fibers are continued forward into the corresponding lip without decussation. Motor innervation is from the buccal branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII).
