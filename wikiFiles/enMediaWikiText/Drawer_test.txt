 The drawer test is a test used by physicians to detect rupture of the cruciate ligaments in the knee. The patient should be supine with the hips flexed to 45 degrees, the knees flexed to 90 degrees and the feet flat on table. The examiner sits on the patient's feet and grasps the patient's tibia and pulls it forward (anterior drawer test) or backward (posterior drawer test). If the tibia pulls forward or backward more than normal, the test is considered positive. Excessive displacement of the tibia anteriorly indicates that the ACL is likely torn, whereas excessive posterior displacement of the tibia indicates that the PCL is likely torn. The Lachman test is a variation on this test in which the knee is in thirty degrees flexion.
