 Rupture of membranes (ROM) or amniorrhexis is a term used during pregnancy to describe a rupture of the amniotic sac. Normally, it occurs spontaneously at full term either during or at the beginning of labor. Rupture of the membranes is known colloquially as "breaking the water." A premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is a rupture of the amnion that occurs prior to the onset of labor. When the amniotic sac ruptures, production of prostaglandins increases and the cushioning between the fetus and uterus is decreased, both of which processes increase the frequency and intensity of contractions. On occasion, with the rupture of membranes, particularly if the head is not engaged, the umbilical cord may prolapse. A cord prolapse is an obstetrical emergency, as the descending head may block fetal-placental circulation. Once the membranes are ruptured, bacteria may ascend and could lead to amnionitis and fetal infection. Detection of rupture of membranes mainly include:
