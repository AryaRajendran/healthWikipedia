 The serum-ascites albumin gradient or gap (SAAG) is a calculation used in medicine to help determine the cause of ascites. The SAAG may be a better discriminant than the older method of classifying ascites fluid as a transudate versus exudate. The formula is as follows: Ideally, the two values should be measured at the same time. This phenomenon is the result of Starling's forces between the fluid of the circulatory system and ascitic fluid. Under normal circumstances the SAAG is < 1.1 because serum oncotic pressure (pulling fluid back into circulation) is exactly counterbalanced by the serum hydrostatic pressure (which pushes fluid out of the circulatory system). This balance is disturbed in certain diseases (such as the Budd-Chiari syndrome, heart failure, or liver cirrhosis) that increase the hydrostatic pressure in the circulatory system. The increase in hydrostatic pressure causes more fluid to leave the circulation into the peritoneal space (ascites). The SAAG subsequently increases because there is more free fluid leaving the circulation, diluting the albumin in the ascitic fluid. The albumin does not move across membrane spaces easily because it is a large molecule. A high gradient (> 1.1 g/dL) indicates the ascites is due to portal hypertension with 97% accuracy. This is due to increased hydrostatic pressure within the blood vessels of the hepatic portal system, which in turn forces water into the peritoneal cavity but leaves proteins such as albumin within the vasculature. Important causes of high SAAG ascites (> 1.1 g/dL) include: A low gradient (< 1.1 g/dL ) indicates causes of ascites not associated with increased portal pressure such as tuberculosis, pancreatitis, nephrotic syndrome and various types of peritoneal cancer.
