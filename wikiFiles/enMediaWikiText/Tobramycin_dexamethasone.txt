 Tobramycin/dexamethasone (INNs, trade name Tobradex) is a prescription medication in the form of eye drops and eye ointment, marketed by Alcon. The active ingredients are tobramycin 0.3% (an antibiotic) and dexamethasone 0.1% (a corticosteroid). It is prescribed for a wide spectrum of bacterial eye infections. Tobradex can also be used to clear or contract styes that are also found in the eye. It is prescribed for the treatment of pink eye in combination with bacterial infections. Because it contains a steroid, careful use with gradual reduction of doses is required. It is strongly contraindicated with herpetic and other viral eye infections. Other contraindications include fungal and mycobacterial infections because tobramycin is inactive against those, and the corticoid acts as an immunosuppressive agent, preventing the body's immune system from dealing with the infection. The drops are also contraindicated in patients with corneal lesions. Similarly to other corticosteroid eye drops, side effects include hypersensitivity and, especially after long-term use, secondary eye infections, cataract (clouding of the eye lens) and increased intraocular pressure, leading to glaucoma. Consequently, the drug should not be applied longer than 24 days. Anticholinergic eye drops potentiate the risk of increased intraocular pressure. Systemic aminoglycoside antibiotics increase toxicity for ears, nerves and kidney.
