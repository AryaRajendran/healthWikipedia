 Hyperammonemia (or hyperammonaemia) is a metabolic disturbance characterised by an excess of ammonia in the blood. It is a dangerous condition that may lead to encephalopathy and death. It may be primary or secondary. Ammonia is a substance that contains nitrogen. It is a product of the catabolism of protein. It is converted to the less toxic substance urea prior to excretion in urine by the kidneys. The metabolic pathways that synthesize urea are located first in the mitochondria and then into the cytosol. The process is known as the urea cycle, which comprises several enzymes acting in sequence. The following list includes such examples: Treatment centers on limiting intake of ammonia and increasing its excretion. Dietary protein (a source of ammonium) is restricted and caloric intake is provided by glucose and fat. Intravenous sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate are pharmacologic agents commonly used as adjunctive therapy to treat hyperammonemia in patients with urea cycle enzyme deficiencies. Sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate can serve as alternatives to urea for the excretion of waste nitrogen. Phenylacetate conjugates with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys. Similarly, sodium benzoate reduces ammonia content in the blood by conjugating with glycine to form hippuric acid, which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys. A preparation containing sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate is available under the trade name Ammonul.Acidification of the intestinal lumen using lactulose can decrease ammonia levels by protonating ammonia and trapping it in the stool. This is a treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment of severe hyperammonemia (serum ammonia levels greater than 1000 Î¼mol/L) should begin with hemodialysis if it is otherwise medically appropriate and tolerated. Hyperammonemia is one of the metabolic derangements that contribute to hepatic encephalopathy.
