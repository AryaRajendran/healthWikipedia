 In human anatomy, the hepatic veins are the blood vessels that drain de-oxygenated blood from the liver and blood cleaned by the liver (from the stomach, pancreas, small intestine and colon) into the inferior vena cava. They arise from the substance of the liver, more specifically the central vein of the liver lobule.None of the hepatic veins have valves. They can be differentiated into two groups, the upper group and lower group. Occlusion of the hepatic veins is known as Budd-Chiari syndrome. File:Slide7cccc.JPG|Hepatic vein
