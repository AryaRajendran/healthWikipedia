 A Triage Tag is a tool first responders and medical personnel use during a mass casualty incident. With the aide of the triage tags, the first-arriving personnel are able to effectively and efficiently distribute the limited resources and provide the necessary immediate care for the victims until more help arrives. Triage tags were first introduced by Baron Dominique Jean Larrey, a French surgeon in Napoleon’s army. Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) is a strategy that the first responders and medical personnel employ to evaluate the severity of injury of each victim as quickly as possible and tag the victims in about 30–60 seconds. The triage tags are placed near the head and are used to better separate the victims so that when more help arrives, the patients are easily recognizable for the extra help to ascertain the most dire cases. A triage tag is two-sided, but the actual layout of the sections vary between and within countries and between governmental agencies. It is now common to use triage tags to allow first responders to have a better handle of the victims during a triage. There is no universal agreement in the design of triage tags, so each authority has implemented their own version to meet their needs. The example Triage Tag shown in this article is the All Risk(R) Triage Tag manufactured by Disaster Management Systems (DMS) located in Pomona, California. This triage tag is manufactured using synthetic paper to enable decontamination. It is the standard tag of several U.S. states including Florida and California. A military version using the terms "EXPECTANT" instead of "MORGUE" and "MINIMAL" rather than "MINOR" is also available. The design of a triage tag could be as simple as the METTAG MT-137, which the military and many governmental agencies use. Another popular Triage Tag is the Smart Tag which allows casualties to be re-triaged without having to replace the tag. It has been adopted as the standard triage tag for New York, Connecticut, Indiana, Illinois, North Carolina, Philadelphia, Boston and Nevada. Typically, the basic sections of a triage tag may include: |style="background:black; color:white;" | Black|style="background:black; color:white;" |Expectant/Morgue || Pain medication only until death|-|style="background:red; color:white;" | Red|style="background:red; color:white;"|Immediate || Life threatening injuries|-|style="background:yellow; color:black;" | Yellow|style="background:yellow; color:black;"|Delayed || Non-life threatening injuries|-|style="background:green; color:white;" | Green|style="background:green; color:white;"|Minimal/Minor || Minor injuries|} Other features may include: A benefit in using the triage tag, besides the fact of improving traffic flow and increasing distributed care among injured patients is during the collection of data. The fill-in slots on the triage tags do not need to be filled out all at once. Information can be obtained and added onto the triage tag throughout the triage. There are cases which a patient’s medical condition changes while still in triage, medical personnel would just tag the patient again with the updated information and label the tags sequentially. The other option is to use a tag which can be altered and where the priority can go up or down. This eliminates the need to re-tag the patient.
