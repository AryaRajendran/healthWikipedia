 STUMP stands for stromal tumor of undetermined malignant potential. They are atypical smooth muscle tumors with low mitotic activity. the Bell criteria were developed to help categorize them by the degree of atypia, the mitotic figures, and necrosis. Evaluation of the mitotic figures in a STUMP requires evaluation of 3 specific criteria Coagulative tumor cell necrosis is common in clinically malignant smooth muscle cell tumors. It consists of an abrupt transition between necrotic cells and preserved cells. Ghost nuclei from necrotic cells are often see, but inflammatory cells are uncommon. Hyalinizing necrosis is more common in leiomyomas. It consists of a zone of hyalinized collagen between dead cells and preserved cells, commonly eosinophilic. If dead nuclei present, they are uniform and the chromatin is often. Necrosis secondary to ulceration in submucous leiomyomas features acute inflammatory cells and a peripheral reparative process, whereas ghost outlines of nuclei are usually inconspicuous or absent.
