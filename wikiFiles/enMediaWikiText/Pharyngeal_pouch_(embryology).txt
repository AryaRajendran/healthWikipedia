 In the development of vertebrate animals, pharyngeal or branchial pouches form on the endodermal side between the branchial arches, and pharyngeal grooves (or clefts) form the lateral ectodermal surface of the neck region to separate the arches. The pouches line up with the clefts, and these thin segments become gills in fish. The endoderm lines the future auditory tube (Pharyngotympanic " Eustachian " tube), middle ear, mastoid antrum, and inner layer of the tympanic membrane. Derivatives include:
