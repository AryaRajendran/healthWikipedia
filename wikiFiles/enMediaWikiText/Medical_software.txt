 The word medical software is an undefined term which can designate any software item or system used within a medical context (e.g. medical devices that monitor or control patients are predominantly controlled by software). Medical devices are frequently regulated and must comply with local and regional laws. In the United States (US), as of the mid-1980s, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has increased its involvement in reviewing the development of medical device software, due to patient overdoses caused by coding errors in a radiation therapy device (Therac-25). The FDA is now focused on regulatory oversight in the medical device software development process and system-level testing. Between 1995 and 2005, IEC 62304 became the benchmark standard for the development of medical software in both the EU and the US. Due to the broad scope covered by this term, manifold classifications can be proposed for various medical software, based for instance on their technical nature (embedded in a device or standalone), on their level of safety (from the most trivial to the most safety-critical ones), or on their primarily function (treatment, education, diagnostics, data management). Manifold examples can be found in the links below.
