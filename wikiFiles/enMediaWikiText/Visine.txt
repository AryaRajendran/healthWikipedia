 Visine is a brand of eye drops produced by [[Johnson & Johnson]]. Johnson & Johnson acquired Visine, along with Pfizer's entire consumer healthcare portfolio, in December 2006. In some countries it is called Vispring. The active ingredients in the original Visine formulation are potassium chloride and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride which is a vasoconstrictor, and therefore constricts the eye's superficial blood vessels to "get the red out", as claimed in Johnson & Johnson's advertising [1]. Visine is administered topically with 1 to 2 drops applied to the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily [2]. A common urban legend is that a few drops of Visine in an unsuspecting victim's drink will cause a harmless bout of diarrhea. This will not produce diarrhea, but oral administration of Visine can induce dangerous side effects related to Visine's ingredient tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride such as: Pfizer recommends that anyone ingesting Visine get medical attention or contact a poison control center immediately. Currently, Visine is formulated in several varieties: VISINE A.C. - Astringent/Redness Reliever Eye Drops (Tetrahydrozoline HCl 0.05%, Zinc sulfate 0.25%) VISINE FOR CONTACTS - For Silicone Hydrogel and Hydrophilic lenses VISINE L.R.
