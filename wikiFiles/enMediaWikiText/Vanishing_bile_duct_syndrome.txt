 Vanishing bile duct syndrome is a loose collection of diseases which leads to the injury to hepatic bile ducts and eventual ductopenia. In fetal and neonatal life the ductal plates are remodeled. The malformations can be atretic or fibrocystic. Bile duct injury and loss can result from autoimmune destruction. T cells recognize biliary epithelial cell antigens causing injury and eventual atresia. The presentation is dependant upon the underlying etiology. The course can be rapid or chronic. Treatment is dependent upon the underlying etiology. Treatment is supportive as it is not possible to induce regrowth of lost ducts.
