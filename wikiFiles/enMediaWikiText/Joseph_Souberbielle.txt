 Joseph Souberbielle (18 March 1754, Pontacq â€“ 10 July 1846, Paris) was a French surgeon. He was a relative of Jean Baseilhac (1703-1781), a surgeon who was a major influence to Souberbielle's career. He moved to Paris in 1774, where he was student of Pierre-Joseph Desault (1738-1795). Afterwards, he worked as a military physician, subsequently serving as chief surgeon for the victors of the Bastille (1789). In 1793 he was a juror of the Revolutionary Tribunal. Known for his work in lithotomy, especially using the suprapubic method. It is believed that he performed over 1200 suprapubic operations for removal of calculi during his career. As did Jean Baseilhac, he advocated use of a caustic paste containing arsenic for cauterization of cancers. The mixture found particular use in treatment of facial ulcers. {{Persondata | NAME = Souberbielle, Joseph | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = French surgeon| DATE OF BIRTH = 1754 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = 1846 | PLACE OF DEATH = }}
