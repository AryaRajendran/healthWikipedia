 Chromosome 17 is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 17 spans more than 81 million base pairs (the building material of DNA) and represents between 2.5 and 3% of the total DNA in cells. Identifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 17 likely contains between 1,200 and 1,500 genes. It also contains the Homeobox B gene cluster. The following are some of the genes located on chromosome 17: The following diseases are related to genes on chromosome 17:
