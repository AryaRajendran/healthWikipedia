 A vaginal septum is a congenital partition within the vagina; such a septum could be either longitudinal or transverse. A longitudinal vaginal septum develops during embryogenesis when there is an incomplete fusion of the lower parts of the two mullerian ducts. As a result, there is a double vagina. There may be associated duplications of the more cranial parts of the mullerian derivatives, a double cervix, and either a uterine septum or uterus didelphys (double uterus). The person with a longitudinal vaginal septum may be asymptomatic and not aware of the condition. If dyspareunia is a problem a simple resection of the septum could be performed. A transverse septum can form during embryogenesis when the mullerian ducts fuse improperly to the urogenital sinus. A complete transverse will block menstrual flow and is a cause of primary amenorrhea. The accumulation of menstrual debris behind the septum is termed cryptomenorrhea. Some transverse septa are incomplete and may lead to dyspareunia or obstruction in labor. A surgical incision will relieve the situation.
