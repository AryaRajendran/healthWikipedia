He attended parochial schools for his primary and secondary education, and then enrolled at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison (UW) in 1970. Stieg earned a B.S. degree in Zoology from UW in 1974. Philip pursued graduate studies in neuroanatomy & neuroscience at Albany Medical College/Union University, and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1980. He then attended medical school at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, completing his M.D. degree in 1983. Stieg was a resident in general surgery and neurosurgery at the University of Texas-Southwestern Medical School & Parkland Memorial Hospital, under the direction of Duke Samson and Hunt Batjer.

Stieg joined the faculty of the Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Children's Hospital of Boston in Boston, MA in 1989, after completion of his postgraduate training. He developed research and clinical interests in cerebral protection and restorative function, neural transplantation, neuronal regeneration after stroke, cerebrovascular surgery, and surgery of the skull base. His investigative studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms of injury in the central nervous system after trauma, as well as mechanisms of cell-membrane transport and their implications after traumatic brain injury. In November 2000, Stieg was named Professor & Chair of the Department of Neurosurgery at Cornell-Weill Medical College and New York-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City.
