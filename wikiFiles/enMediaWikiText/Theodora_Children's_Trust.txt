 Theodora Children's Trust is a British charity which helps children recover from operations and illness. Founded in 1994. The charity sends Giggle Doctors to work in collaboration with hospital staff in order to bring fun and laughter to children in hospital. The hospitals involved in the programme receive weekly visits from "Giggle Doctors". The Giggle Doctors use their skills to involve each patient as much as possible, ensuring that the child is not only a spectator but can participate in the magic and the activities. The Giggle Doctors also involve the families and the medical staff in these sessions. In April 1994, the charity introduced two Giggle Doctors to Gt Ormond Street Hospital. Today, the charity makes life better for 60,000 children in hospitals and residential care throughout the UK.
