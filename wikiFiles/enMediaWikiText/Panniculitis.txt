 Panniculitis is a group of diseases whose hallmark is inflammation of subcutaneous adipose tissue (the fatty layer under the skin - panniculus adiposus). Symptoms include tender skin nodules, and systemic signs such as weight loss and fatigue. Restated, an inflammatory disorder primarily localized in the subcutaneous fat is termed a "panniculitis," a group of disorders that may be challenging both for the clinician and the dermatopathologist. It can occur in any fatty tissue (cutaneous or visceral) and is often diagnosed on the basis of a deep skin biopsy, and can be further classified by histological characteristics based on the location of the inflammatory cells (within fatty lobules or in the septa which separate them) and on the presence or absence of vasculitis. There are thus four main histological subtypes: Panniculitis can also be classified based on the presence or absence of systemic symptoms: Lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy (the loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue) can occur in any of these conditions.
