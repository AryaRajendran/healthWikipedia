 Transnasal esophagoscopy (TNE) is a technique for screening for esophageal cancer and other disorders. TNE has been used by otolaryngologists since 2000 as a diagnostic tool to detect globus, dysphagia, laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), and gastroesophageal reï¬‚ux disease (GERD). TNE may also be useful in detecting Barrett's, but there is incongruence between TNE findings and biopsy results. Experts in the field suggest that TNE may replace radiographic imaging of the esophagus in otolaryngology patients with reflux, globus, and dysphagia. Transnasal esophagoscopy is an office based procedure in which the patient is anesthetized locally in the nose and sometimes the oropharynx. The scope is advanced into the ipsilateral pyriform sinus and through the esophageal inlet to the stomach, where the esophagus can be examined, with special attention paid to the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. An advantage of TNE over other more invasive cancer screening methods that require conscious sedation is that it can be performed using topical anesthesia alone with the patient sitting upright in an exam chair unencumbered by cardiac monitoring equipment.
