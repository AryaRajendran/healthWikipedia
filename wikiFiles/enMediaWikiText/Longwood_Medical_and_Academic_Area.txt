 The Longwood Medical and Academic Area (also known as Longwood Medical Area, LMA, or simply Longwood) is a medical campus in Boston.Centered on Longwood Avenue as it runs from Huntington Avenue to The Riverway, LMA straddles the Fenway-Kenmore and Mission Hill neighborhoods.It is most strongly associated with the Harvard Medical School and other medical facilities such as Harvard's teaching hospitals,but prominent non-Harvard and non-medical institutions are located there as well, such as museums, colleges and research centers. LMA is served by two rail stations at opposite ends of Longwood Avenue:"Longwood" (on the MBTA Green Line's "D" branch) and"Longwood Medical Area" (on the "E" branch).Several public bus routes serve the area, andshuttles (generally for affiliated personnel only) connect with destinations such as the Cambridge campuses of Harvard and MIT.
