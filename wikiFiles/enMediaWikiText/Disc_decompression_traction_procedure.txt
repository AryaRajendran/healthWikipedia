 Disc Decompression Traction Procedures are used by healthcare professionals specializing in therapeutic procedures that facilitate healing of bio-mechanical abnormalities of the musculoskelatal system of the human body. Intervertebral discs are commonly treated for abnormal function due to displacement of the nucleus pulposus, the gelatinous center that acts as a ball-bearing joint and shock absorber. The surrounding annulus fibrosus, rubberband-like layers of fibro-elastic tissue, maintains a grip of the central nucleus pulposus. Spinal disc herniation is treated in a variety of ways, from exercise therapy or manipulation to surgery. Recent development of Decompression Traction Equipment has led to a higher success rate of disc healing than previous treatment options. The decompression traction procedure relieves pressure that builds up on the discs and nerves by drawing areas of herniated disc back into place. This is accomplished by creating negative pressure within the disc, referred to as negative intra-discal pressure, creating a vacuum to draw the bulging and herniated disc material back into the disc space and relieve pressure. This process allows the stretched or torn annulus fibrosus tissue fibers to heal and tighten due to the slack created by the decompression traction therapy. Many research articles point out the positive effects of spinal disc decompression therapy. This type of therapy is valuable for varying degrees of disc compromise. Discs that have full herniations to those that are small protrusions. Many different devices and brands are available for treatment of decompressing the disc, despite what any one practitioner may say all of them do basically the same thing. The only major difference may be the cost of the treatment and if any warmup exercise is done. The warmup is the most vital part of the therapy as it warms up the muscles to prepare them to stretch.
