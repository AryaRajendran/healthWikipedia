 A urinalysis (UA), also known as routine and microscopy (R&M;), is an array of tests performed on urine, and one of the most common methods of medical diagnosis. The word is a portmanteau of the words urine and analysis. The target parameters that can be measured or quantified in urinalysis include many substances and cells, as well as other properties, such as specific gravity. A part of a urinalysis can be performed by using urine test strips, in which the test results can be read as color changes. Another method is light microscopy of urine samples. In addition to the substances mentioned in tables below, other tests include a description of color and appearance. Target !! Lower limit !! Upper limit !! Unit !! Comments !!

In turn citing: 100 || 250 || mg / 24 hours || Phosphate (P) – per day n/a || 38 || mmol / 24 h || is the hyperexcretion of phosphate in the urine. This condition is divided into primary and secondary types. Primary hypophosphatemia is characterized by direct excess excretion of phosphate by the kidneys, as from primary renal dysfunction, and also the direct action of many classes of diuretics on the kidneys. Additionally, secondary causes, including both types of hyperparathyroidism, cause hyperexcretion of phosphate in the urine. || A sodium-related parameter is fractional sodium excretion, which is the percentage of the sodium filtered by the kidney which is excreted in the urine. It is a useful parameter in acute renal failure and oliguria, with a value below 1% indicating a prerenal disease and a value above 3% indicating acute tubular necrosis or other kidney damage. Target !! Lower limit !! Upper limit !! Unit !! Comments Protein 0 trace amounts/ 20 || mg/dl || Proteins may be measured with the Albustix test. Since proteins are very large molecules (macromolecules), they are not normally present in measurable amounts in the glomerular filtrate or in the urine. The detection of protein in urine, called proteinuria, may indicate the permeability of the glomerulus is abnormally increased. This may be caused by renal infections or by other diseases that have secondarily affected the kidneys, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, jaundice, or hyperthyroidism. Human chorionic gonadotropin hCG – 50 Target !! Lower limit !! Upper limit !! Unit !! Comments Red blood cells (RBCs) / erythrocytes 0 2 – 3 per High Power Field (HPF) May be present as intact RBCs, which indicate bleeding. Even trace amount of blood is enough to give the entire urine sample a red/pink hue, and it is difficult to judge the amount of bleeding from a gross examination. Hematuria may be due to a generalized bleeding diathesis or a urinary tract-specific problem (trauma, stone, infection, malignancy, etc.) or artefact of catheterization in case the sample is taken from a collection bag, in which case a fresh urine sample should be sent for a repeat test. If the RBCs are of renal or glomerular origin (due to glomerulonephritis), the RBCs incur mechanical damage during the glomerular passage, and then osmotic damage along the tubules, so get dysmorphic features. The dysmorphic RBCs in urine which are most characteristic of glomerular origin are called "G1 cells", which are doughnut-shaped rings with protruding round blebs sometimes looking like Mickey Mouse (with ears). Painless hematuria of nonglomerular origin may be a sign of urinary tract malignancy, which may warrant a more thorough cytological investigation. RBC casts n/a 0 / negative White blood cells (WBCs) / leukocytes / (pus cells) 0 2 / negative – 10 per µl or mm<sup>3</sup> "Significant pyuria" at greater than or equal to 10 leucocytes per microlitre (µl) or cubic millimeter (mm<sup>3</sup>) "Blood" / (actually hemoglobin) || n/a || 0 / negative || dip-stick qualitative scale of 0 to 4+|| Hemoglobinuria is suggestive of in vivo hemolysis, but must be distinguished from hematuria. In case of hemoglobinuria, a urine dipstick shows presence of blood, but no RBCs are seen on microscopic examination. If hematuria is followed by artefactual ex vivo or in vitro hemolysis in the collected urine, then the dipstick test also will be positive for hemoglobin and will be difficult to interpret. The urine color may also be red due to excretion of reddish pigments or drugs. Target !! Lower limit !! Upper limit !! Unit !! Comments Glucose n/a || 0 / negative || || Glucose can be measured with Benedict's test. Although glucose is easily filtered in the glomerulus, it is not present in the urine because all of the glucose filtered is normally reabsorbed from the renal tubules back into the blood. Presence of glucose in the urine is called glucosuria. Ketone bodies n/a || 0 / negative || || With carbohydrate deprivation, such as starvation or high-protein diets, the body relies increasingly on the metabolism of fats for energy. This pattern is also seen in people with diabetes mellitus, when a lack of the hormone insulin prevents the body cells from using the large amounts of glucose available in the blood. This happens because insulin is necessary for the transport of glucose from the blood into the body cells. The metabolism of fat proceeds in a series of steps. First, triglycerides are hydrolyzed to fatty acids and glycerol. Second, the fatty acids are hydrolyzed into smaller intermediate compounds (acetoacetic acid, betahydroxybutyric acid, and acetone). Thirdly, the intermediate products are used in aerobic cellular respiration. When the production of the intermediate products of fatty acid metabolism (collectively known as ketone bodies) exceeds the ability of the body to metabolize these compounds, they accumulate in the blood and some end up in the urine (ketonuria). Bilirubin n/a || 0 / negative || || The fixed phagocytic cells of the spleen and bone marrow destroy old red blood cells and convert the heme groups of hemoglobin to the pigment bilirubin. The bilirubin is secreted into the blood and carried to the liver, where it is bonded to (conjugated with) glucuronic acid, a derivative of glucose. Some of the conjugated bilirubin is secreted into the blood and the rest is excreted in the bile as bile pigment that passes into the small intestine. The blood normally contains a small amount of free and conjugated bilirubin. An abnormally high level of blood bilirubin may result from an increased rate of red blood cell destruction, liver damage (as in hepatitis and cirrhosis), and obstruction of the common bile duct as with gallstones. An increase in blood bilirubin results in jaundice, a condition characterized by a brownish-yellow pigmentation of the skin and of the sclera of the eyes.

Comments Urine specific gravity 1.003 1.030 no unit This test detects the ion concentration of urine. Small amounts of protein or ketoacidosis tend to elevate the urine's specific gravity (SG). This value is measured using a urinometer and indicates hydration or dehydration. If the SG is under 1.010, the patient is hydrated Osmolality 400 n/a mOsm/kg pH 5 7 Bacterial cultures by urination – by bladder catheterisation – 100 When doctors order a urinalysis, they will request either a routine urinalysis or a routine and microscopy (R&M;) urinalysis, with the difference being a routine urinalysis does not include microscopy or culture. A urine test strip can quantify: The numbers and types of cells and/or material such as urinary casts can yield a great detail of information and may suggest a specific diagnosis.
