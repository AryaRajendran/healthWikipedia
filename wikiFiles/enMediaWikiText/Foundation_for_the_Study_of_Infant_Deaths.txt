 The Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths (FSID) is British charitable organisation aiming to prevent unexpected deaths in infancy and promote infant health. FSID funds research, supports families whose babies have died suddenly and unexpectedly, disseminates information on infant health, baby care and sudden infant deaths to health professionals and the general public, and works with professionals to improve investigations when a baby dies. FSID operates throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland. As well as the team in head office there are also eight Regional Development Officers who actively promote FSID's campaigns across the country. Over a third of a century ago – in 1971 – a meeting was convened in Cambridge as a result of one grandmother's search to find out why her baby grandson had died suddenly and unexpectedly. This gathering led to the founding of the world's first organisation devoted to research, information and support in the field of infant deaths. Since FSID teamed up with the Department of Heath to launch the campaign to reduce the risk of cot death in 1991, the UK cot death rate has fallen by 75%, and has been hailed one of the most successful public health campaigns ever, estimated to have saved more than 20,000 lives. FSID has gone on to become one of the world's leading authorities on cot death, the UK's largest funder of medical research into sudden infant death, the main source of support for bereaved families and a major information provider. In 2012, British Independent Record label, Audio Antihero, released a benefit compilation album titled Some.Alternate.Universe to raise money for FSID. The album featured artists like Jeffrey Lewis, Nosferatu D2, Jonah Matranga, Benjamin Shaw, Eddie Argos (Art Brut), Jack Hayter (Hefner), Still Corners, Fighting Kites, Johnny Foreigner, Paul Hawkins & The Awkward Silences.
