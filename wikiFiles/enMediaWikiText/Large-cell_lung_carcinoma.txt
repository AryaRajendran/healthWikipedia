 Large-cell lung carcinoma (LCLC) is a heterogeneous group of undifferentiated malignant neoplasms originating from transformed epithelial cells in the lung. [[File:Pie chart of lung cancers.svg|thumb|260px|Pie chart showing incidence of large-cell lung cancer (shown in green at upper left) as compared to other lung cancer types, with fractions of smokers versus non-smokers shown for each type. In most series, LCLC's comprise between 5% and 10% of all lung cancers. According to the Nurses' Health Study, the risk of large cell lung carcinoma increases with a previous history of tobacco smoking, with a previous smoking duration of 30 to 40 years giving a relative risk of approximately 2.3 compared to never-smokers, and a duration of more than 40 years giving a relative risk of approximately 3.6. LCLC is, in effect, a "diagnosis of exclusion", in that the tumor cells lack light microscopic characteristics that would classify the neoplasm as a small-cell carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or other more specific histologic type of lung cancer. LCLC is differentiated from small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) primarily by the larger size of the anaplastic cells, a higher cytoplasmic-to-nuclear size ratio, and a lack of "salt-and-pepper" chromatin. The newest revisions of the World Health Organization Histological Typing of Lung Cancer schema include several variants of LCLC, including (a) basaloid, (b) clear cell, (c) lymphoepithelioma-like, (d) rhabdoid phenotype, and (e) large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. In addition, a "subvariant", called "combined large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma", or c-LCNEC, is recognized under the new system. To be designated a c-LCNEC, the tumor must contain at least 10% LCNEC cells, in combination with at least 10% of other forms of NSCLC. One clinically significant subtype is "large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma", which is believed to derive from neuroendocrine cells. Patients typically present with a non-productive cough and weight loss.
