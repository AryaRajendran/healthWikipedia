 The World Health Organization has traditionally classified death according to the primary type of disease or injury. However, causes of death may also be classified in terms of preventable risk factors—such as smoking, unhealthy diet, and sexual behavior—which contribute to a number of different diseases. Such risk factors are usually not recorded directly on death certificates. It is estimated that of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes. In industrialized nations the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%. Thus, albeit indirectly, biological aging (senescence) is by far the leading cause of death. Whether senescence as a biological process itself can be slowed down, halted or even reversed, is a subject of current scientific speculation and research. Leading causes of preventable death worldwide as of the year 2001, according to researchers working with the Disease Control Priorities Network (DCPN) and the World Health Organization (WHO). (The WHO's 2008 statistics show very similar trends.) Cause Number of deaths resulting (millions per year) Hypertension 7.8 Smoking tobacco 5.0 Malnutrition 3.8 Sexually transmitted diseases 3.0 Poor diet 2.8 Overweight and obesity 2.5 Physical inactivity 2.0 Alcohol 1.9 Indoor air pollution from solid fuels 1.8 Unsafe water and poor sanitation 1.6 In 2001, on average 29 000 children died of preventable causes each day (that is, about 20 deaths per minute). The authors provide the context: Annual number of deaths in the United States and causes Cause !! Number !! Percent of total !! Notes Smoking tobacco 435,000 18.1% Being overweight and obesity 111,909 4.6% There was considerable debate about the differences in the numbers of obesity-related diseases. The numbers reported in the referenced article have been found to be the most accurate. Alcohol 85,000 3.5% Infectious diseases 75,000 3.1% Toxic agents including toxins, particulates and radon 55,000 2.3% Preventable medical errors in hospitals 44,000 to 98,000 Traffic collisions 43,000 1.8% Firearms deaths 29,000 1.2% Sexually transmitted infections 20,000 0.8% Drug abuse 17,000 0.7% Various injuries are the leading cause of death in children 9 – 18 years of age. The top five worldwide unintentional injuries in children are as follows: Cause Number of deaths resulting Traffic collision 260,000 per year Drowning 175,000 per year Burns 96,000 per year Falls 47,000 per year Toxins 45,000 per year
