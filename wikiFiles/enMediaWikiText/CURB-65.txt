 CURB65 Symptom !! Points Confusion 1 Urea>7mmol/l ||1 Respiratory rate>30 ||1 SBP<90mmHg, DBP<60mmHg||1 Age>=65 ||1 CURB-65, also known as the CURB criteria, is a clinical prediction rule that has been validated for predicting mortality in community-acquired pneumonia and infection of any site. The CURB-65 is based on the earlier CURB score and is recommended by the British Thoracic Society for the assessment of severity of pneumonia. The score is an acronym for each of the risk factors measured. Each risk factor scores one point, for a maximum score of 5: The risk of death at 30 days increases as the score increases: The CURB-65 has been compared to the pneumonia severity index in predicting mortality from pneumonia. It was shown that the PSI has a higher discriminatory power for short-term mortality, and thus is more accurate for low risk patients than the CURB-65 or its predecessor, the CURB score. It is used as a means of deciding the action that is needed to be taken for that patient. Patients with any type of infection (half of the patients had pneumonia), the risk of death increases as the score increases:
