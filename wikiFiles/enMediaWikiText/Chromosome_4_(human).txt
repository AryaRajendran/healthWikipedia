 125px|rightChromosome 4 is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 4 spans more than 186 million base pairs (the building material of DNA) and represents between 6 and 6.5 percent of the total DNA in cells. The chromosome is ~191 megabases in length. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes reported varies. 757 protein encoding genes have been identified on this chromosome to date. 211 (27.9%) of these coding sequences currently do not have any experimental evidence at the protein level. 271 appear to be membrane proteins. 54 have been classified as cancer associated proteins. A consortium has been established to study chromosome 4. The following are some of the genes located on chromosome 4: The following are some of the diseases related to genes located on chromosome 4:
