 The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) is a global initiative to bring together professional organizations in reducing mortality from sepsis. The purpose of the SSC is to create an international collaborative effort to improve the treatment of sepsis and reduce the high mortality rate associated with the condition. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement have teamed up to achieve a 25 percent reduction in sepsis mortality by 2009. Mortality associated with severe sepsis remains high at 30-50%. When shock is present, mortality is reported to be even higher at around 50-60%. Approximately 1400 people die from sepsis each day throughout the world. In the U.S. there are approximately 750,000 new sepsis cases each year, with at least 210,000 fatalities and this is reported to be same throughout Europe. As medicine becomes more advanced, with invasive procedures and immunosuppression, the incidence of sepsis is likely to increase even more. This is done using a six-pronged approach: Using bundles in health care simplifies the complex processes of the care of patients with severe sepsis. A bundle is a selected set of elements of care distilled from evidence-based practice guidelines that, when implemented as a group, have an effect on outcomes beyond implementing the individual elements alone. Each hospital's sepsis protocol may be customized, but it must meet the standards created by the bundle. The first 6 hour SSC Resuscitation Bundle includes: Further management is centered around Early Goal Directed Therapy (EGDT). Resuscitation Goals are: The 24 hour SSC Management Bundle includes:
