 A biobank is a physical place which stores biobank specimens. These samples are stored so that researchers can use them in experiments. This page contains a list of biobanks. Biobanks can be classified in several ways. Some examples of how they can be classified is by their controlling entity (government, commercial enterprise, or private research institution), by their geographical location, or by what sorts of samples they collect. Biobanks may be classified by purpose or design. Disease-oriented biobanks usually have a hospital affiliation through which they collect samples representing a variety of diseases, perhaps to look for biomarkers affiliated with disease. Population-based biobanks need need no particular hospital affiliation because they samples from large numbers of all kinds of people, perhaps to look for biomarkers for disease susceptibility in a general population.
