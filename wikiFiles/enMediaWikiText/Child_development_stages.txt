 Child development stages describe theoretical milestones of child development, some of which asserted as nativist theories. This article puts forward a general model based on the most widely accepted developmental stages. However, it is important to understand that there is wide variation in terms of what is considered "normal," driven by a wide variety of genetic, cognitive, physical, family, cultural, nutritional, educational, and environmental factors. Many children will reach some or most of these milestones at different times from the norm. Kids grow up and develop at different rates. {| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"|+Developmental Milestones Age !! Average length/height (cm) !! Length growth !! Average weight !! Weight gain !!
