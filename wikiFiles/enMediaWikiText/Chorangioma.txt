 A chorangioma is a non-neoplastic, hamartoma-like growth in the placenta consisting of blood vessels. Large chorangiomas are diagnosed by ultrasound or MRI, and confirmed by histologic examination of the placenta. Histologically, chorangioma consist of abundant vascular channels and may be cellular. Most chorangiomas are not clinically significant, i.e. they do not have an adverse effect on placental function. The significance of a chorangioma is determined by its size and whether it is found together with other chorangiomas. Chorangiomas are significant if multiple or "large", i.e. greater than 4 cm or 5 cm. Small chorangiomas are not treated. Large chorangioma can be treated several ways, including chemical ablation and laser coagulation.
