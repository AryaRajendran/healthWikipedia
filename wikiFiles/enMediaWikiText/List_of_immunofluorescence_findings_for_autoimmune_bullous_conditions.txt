 Several cutaneous conditions can be diagnosed with the aid of immunofluorescence studies. Cutaneous conditions with positive direct or indirect immunofluorescence when using salt-split skin include: Antibody isotype(s) and location of antibody deposition in immunofluorescence studies using salt-split skin for autoimmune bullous conditions targeting the basement membrane zone of the human integumentary system Condition !! Antibody isotype(s) deposited !! Localization of antibody with use of salt-split skin Antiepilegrin cicatricial pemphigoid IgG Dermal Bullous lupus erythematosus Dermal Bullous pemphigoid IgG Epidermal Cicatricial pemphigoid IgG Epidermal Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita IgG Dermal Linear IgA bullous dermatosis IgA Epidermal Orf-induced immunobullous disease IgG Dermal Pemphigoid gestationis IgG Epidermal For several subtypes of pemphigus a variety of substrates are used for indirect immunofluorescence: Substrates used in indirect immunofluorescence studies for the different pemphigus variants Pemphigus variant !! Substrate Pemphigus foliaceous Guinea pig esophagus Pemphigus vulgaris Monkey esophagus IgA pemphigus Cultured skin Paraneoplastic pemphigus Rat bladder
