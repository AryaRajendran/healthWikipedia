 Failure to thrive (FTT) or weight faltering used in both pediatric and adult medicine, as well as veterinary medicine (where it is also referred to as ill thrift) indicates insufficient weight gain or inappropriate weight loss. When not more precisely defined, the term refers to pediatric patients. In MeSH, the term is assumed to refer to an infant or child. In children, it is usually defined in terms of weight, and can be evaluated either by a low weight for the child's age, or by a low rate of increase in the weight. As used by pediatricians, it covers poor physical growth of any cause and does not imply abnormal intellectual, social, or emotional development, although of course it can subsequently be a cause of such pathologies. The term has been used in different ways, and different objective standards have been defined. Many definitions use the 5th percentile as a cutoff. Traditionally, causes of FTT have been divided into endogenous and exogenous causes. Initial investigation should consider physical causes, calorie intake and psychosocial assessment. Recently the term "faltering growth" has become a popular replacement for "failure to thrive", which in the minds of some represents a more euphemistic term. The term "failure to thrive" is also applied to geriatrics, or more generally in adult medicine. In adult medicine, failure to thrive is a descriptive, non-specific term that encompasses "not doing well": e.g.,Â malaise, weight loss, poor self-care that can be seen in elderly individuals.
