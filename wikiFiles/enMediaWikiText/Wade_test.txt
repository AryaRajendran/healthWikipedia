 The Wade test is a neurological test performed by surgeons and neurologists, to determine whether a patient is left cortical hemisphere dominant or right cortical hemisphere dominant. Most individuals (about 95% of the time) who are right handed are left cortical hemisphere dominant, while about 10% of individuals who are left handed, are right cortical hemisphere dominant. The dominance refers to the cortex where often propositional language centers such as Broca's area located in pars opercularis and pars triangularis of the frontal lobe responsible for generation of speech, Wernicke's area located in superior temporal gyrus, responsible for comprehension of speech, and other motor and somatosensory areas are located. The dominant hemisphere is therefore responsible for language, and comprehension of speech. The test involves injection of sodium amobarbital (Amytal), an anesthetic into the patient's carotid artery on the suspected dominant side, and then evaluating patient for speech and language comprehension. Any form of aphasia (difficulty in speech) whether non-fluent, fluent, or conduction would indicate that the side into which Amytal was injected was in fact the dominant cerebral cortex. Since Wade test in essence, mimics a temporary lesion of the dominant cortex, other side effects such as astereognosis, Gerstmann syndrome, alexia, agraphia, tactile agnosia (bimanual astereognosis), ideomotor apraxia, and ideational apraxia is possible. The test is used during neurosurgical and presurgical epilepsy evaluations to localize areas of language and memory that are important for normal functioning. Such a test can help determine if more presurgical tests are needed, whether a person is a suitable candidate for surgery, and the possible outcome or risk of a surgery at the area.
