 A renal cyst is a fluid collection in the kidney. There are several types based on the Bosniak classification. The majority are benign, simple cysts that can be monitored and not intervened upon. However, some are cancerous or are suspicious for cancer and are commonly removed in a surgical procedure called nephrectomy. Numerous renal cysts are seen in the cystic kidney diseases, which include polycystic kidney disease and medullary sponge kidney. Up to 27% of individuals greater than 50 years of age may have simple renal cysts that cause no symptoms. Renal cysts are classified as either malignant or benign using the Bosniak Classification System. The system was created by Dr. Morton Bosniak, a faculty member at the NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. The Bosniak classification categorizes renal cysts into five groups.
