 Tic disorders are defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) based on type (motor or phonic) and duration of tics (sudden, rapid, nonrhythmic, stereotyped). Tic disorders are defined similarly by the World Health Organization (ICD-10 codes). Tic disorders are classified as follows: Tic disorders onset in childhood (before the age of 18), and are not due to the effects of medication or another medical condition. DSM-IV-TR diagnosis codes for the tic disorders are: ICD10 diagnosis codes are: A large, community-based study suggested that over 19% of school-age children have tic disorders; the children with tic disorders in that study were usually undiagnosed. As many as 1 in 100 people may experience some form of tic disorder, usually before the onset of puberty. Tourette syndrome is the more severe expression of a spectrum of tic disorders, which are thought to be due to the same genetic vulnerability. Nevertheless, most cases of Tourette syndrome are not severe. Although a significant amount of investigative work indicates genetic linkage of the various tic disorders, further study is needed to confirm the relationship. Treatment of tic disorders, although not usually necessary, is similar to treatment of Tourette syndrome. Tics should be distinguished from other causes of tourettism.
