 Number needed to vaccinate (NNV) is a metric used in the evaluation of vaccines, and in the determination of vaccination policy. It is a specific application of the number needed to treat metric (NNT) that incorporates the implications of herd immunity. In order to determine a NNV, it is necessary to identify a specific population and a defined endpoint, because these can vary: For example, one study reported a number needed to vaccinate of 5206 for invasive pneumococcal disease. Still, despite the limitations, the NNV can serve as a useful resource. For example, it can be used to report the results of computer simulations of varying vaccination strategies.
