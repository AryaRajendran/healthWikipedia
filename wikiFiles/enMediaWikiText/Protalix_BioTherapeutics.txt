 Protalix BioTherapeutics is an Israeli pharmaceutical company whose plant-based enzyme, taliglucerase alfa, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Gaucher disease. Protalix BioTherapeutics was established in 1993. It was founded by Yoseph Shaaltiel, who received his Ph.D. in Plant Biochemistry from the Weizmann Institute in Israel and served in the Biology Department of the Israel Defense Forces' Biological and Chemical Center. One of the earliest and largest investors in the company was Phillip Frost. In its early days Protalix operated out of a warehouse in the town of Qiryat Shemona in northern Israel. Protalix entered into a partnership agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 2006 for the development of two proteins and in 2009 signed a collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of its taliglucerase alfa treatment. Also in 2009, Protalix reported that [[Frost & Sullivan]] presented the company with its 2009 European Orphan DiseasesMarket Product Innovation of the Year Award. In 2011 Protalix announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the company's manufacturing facility in Carmiel.

This merger was completed on December 31, 2006, and is notable as one of the largest reverse mergers executed, valuing the joint entity at almost $1 Billion.
