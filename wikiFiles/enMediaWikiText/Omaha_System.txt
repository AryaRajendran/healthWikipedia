 The Omaha System is a standardized health care terminology consisting of an assessment component (Problem Classification Scheme), an intervention component (Intervention Scheme), and an outcomes component (Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes). Approximately 11,000 interdisciplinary practitioners, educators, and researchers use Omaha System for structured clinical documentation and analysis of secondary data. Omaha System users from Japan, Estonia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Wales, Canada, The Netherlands, and the United States have presented at international Omaha System conferences. The Omaha System is integrated into the National Library of Medicineâ€™s Metathesaurus, CINAHL, ABC Codes, NIDSEC, Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC), and SNOMED CT. It is registered (recognized) by Health Level Seven (HL7), and is congruent with the reference terminology model for the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It is being mapped to the International Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP). The Omaha system is a reliable nursing documentation tool for outcome and quality of care measurement for clients with mental illness. The Omaha System is a tool that can be used as a strategy to introduce and incorporate evidence-based practice in the undergraduate nursing clinical experience.
