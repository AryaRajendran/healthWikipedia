 The Divers Alert Network (DAN) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization devoted to assisting divers in need. The DAN Research department conducts significant medical research on recreational scuba diving safety. Supported by donations, grants, and membership dues, DAN's studies are revealing important information that will benefit the entire diving community and improve Recreational diving safety worldwide. The DAN Medicine Department makes it easy for divers worldwide to find answers to their diving medical questions. In 1977, Undersea Medical Society (later the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society) introduced the concept of a national organization (to replace LEO-FAST at Brooks Air Force Base, directed by Colonel Jefferson Davis, M.D.) where one telephone call from anywhere could connect the caller to a diving medicine specialist 24 hours a day. Dr. Peter B. Bennett received a two-year grant from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in September 1980 to form the "National Diving Accident Network" at the Frank G. Hall Hyperbaric Center at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. In 1981, DAN published "Underwater Diving Accident Manual". The Hyperbaric Center received 305 calls for information and assistance. DAN implemented a medical/safety advisory telephone line (919-684-2948) to handle questions from recreational divers with non-emergency questions in 1982. This change was followed by a name change from "Diving Accident Network" to "Divers Alert Network" and hosted the first annual Diving Accident and Hyperbaric Treatment CME course at the Duke University Medical Center. In 1984, federal grant monies were decreased (50 percent in 1982 and then by 25 percent in 1983) and support now comes exclusively from divers and the diving industry. In 1985 DAN started their 'sponsor program' for clubs, stores and corporations, they then in 1987 pioneered an insurance program in and with the introduction this program, the membership numbers doubled to 32,000 in 1988. The IRS granted DAN its 501(c)(3) non-profit status in 1990. The organization continues to be associated with Duke University Medical Center but moved its offices from the Frank G. Hall Labs to off campus office space. The Flying After Diving research trials begin in 1991. Also in 1991 DAN introduces it first training course 'Oxygen First aid Training Program and DAN Travel Assist. International DAN - known as IDAN - began to meet at Duke University. IDAN members include: DAN Europe, DAN Japan, and DAN Asia Pacific. DAN is awarded the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society's Craig Hoffman Diving Safety Award in June 1992 for its significant contributions to the health and safety of recreational divers. This marked the first time the prestigious award is presented to a group and not to an individual. In Sept 1992 the first DAN Instructor Training Workshop is brought about alongside Oxygen First Aid Training program being introduced to Europe. 1993 see DAN open their own insurance company 'Accident General Insurance'. Oxygen First Aid Training is now being taught in Australia, by 1996 it is being taught in 7 continents. DAN start to introduce other diving related 1st aid Training courses - 'O2 1st aid for aquatic emergencies' (1998), 'Remote Oxygen (REMo2) (1999), Hazardous Marine Life Injuries (2000), Automatic External Difibrulation (AED) (2001) and Advanced Oxygen Provide (2002.DAN moved to its new, permanent headquarters, the Peter B. Bennett Center. Dr. Bennett received the 2002 Diving Equipment and Marketing Association (DEMA) Reaching Out Award for his contribution to the dive industry and the Carolinas' Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2002 award for contributions to business in the life sciences. He announced his retirement as DAN President effective June 30, 2003 After Dr. Bennett resigned as DAN President and CEO, DAN Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Dan Orr, MS was named acting president and CEO. DAN established the Peter B. Bennett Research Fund, within the Endowment Fund to support research initiatives, enhancing dive safety far into the future. In 2004, Michael D. Curley, Ph.D. was named DAN President and CEO. In 2006, Dr. Curley stepped down and Mr. Orr was named as the DAN President and CEO. In February 2009, DAN launched a web site for their bi-monthly magazine "Alert Diver Online".
