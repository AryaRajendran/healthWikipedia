 AA amyloidosis is a form of amyloidosis, i.e. a disease characterized by the abnormal deposition of fibers of insoluble protein in the extracellular space of various tissues and organs. In AA amyloidosis, the deposited protein is serum amyloid A protein (SAA), an acute-phase protein which is normally soluble and whose plasma concentration is highest during inflammation. AA amyloidosis is therefore a complication of a number of inflammatory diseases and infections, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, chronic osteomyelitis, and the inheritable condition called familial Mediterranean fever. It can also be caused by Hodgkin's lymphoma and renal cell carcinoma. The SAA protein is mainly deposited in the liver, spleen and kidney, and AA amyloidosis can lead to nephrotic syndrome.<ref name=> Kiacta - (eprodisate disodium) is currently being evaluated as a protector of renal function in AA amyloidosis.
