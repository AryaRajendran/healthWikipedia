 A coronal plane (also known as the frontal plane) is any vertical plane that divides the body into ventral and dorsal (belly and back) sections. It is one of the planes of the body used to describe the location of body parts in relation to each other. For a human, the mid-coronal plane would transect a standing body into two halves (front and back, or anterior and posterior) in an imaginary line that cuts through both shoulders. The term is derived from Latin corona (“‘garland, crown’”), from Ancient Greek κορώνη (korōnē), “‘garland, wreath’”). The coronal plane is an example of a longitudinal plane, because it is perpendicular to the transverse plane.
