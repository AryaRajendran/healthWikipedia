 Goitrogens are substances that suppress the function of the thyroid gland by interfering with iodine uptake, which can, as a result, cause an enlargement of the thyroid, i.e., a goiter. Chemicals that have been shown to have goitrogenic effects include: Certain raw foods (cooking partially inactivates the goitrogens, except in the cases of soy and millet) have been identified as lightly goitrogenic. These foods include: Thyroid hyperplasia has been demonstrated in mice: Despite being generally a stimulant, caffeine acts on thyroid function as a suppressant. Indeed some studies on rats suggest that excess caffeine in conjunction with a lack of iodine may promote the formation of thyroid cancers. Some foods and drinks have an opposite effect on the thyroid gland; that is, they stimulate thyroid function rather than suppressing it, examples being avocado and saturated fat.
