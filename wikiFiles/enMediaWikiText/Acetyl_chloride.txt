 Acetyl chloride, CH<sub>3</sub>COCl, also known as ethanoyl chloride or acyl chloride, is an acid chloride derived from acetic acid. It belongs to the class of organic compounds called acyl halides. It is a colorless liquid. The usual method involves the reaction of acetic acid with standard inorganic chlorodehydrating agents, such as by using PCl<sub>3</sub>, PCl<sub>5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, or SOCl<sub>2</sub>. However, this usually gives acetyl chloride which is contaminated by phosphorus or sulfur impurities, which may interfere with the organic reactions. It is produced by the reaction of hydrogen chloride with acetic anhydride: HCl impurities can be removed by distilling the crude product from dimethylaniline or by degassing the mixture by a stream of argon. It may also be synthesized from the catalytic carbonylation of methyl chloride. Heating dichloroacetic chloride with acetic acid also gives acetyl chloride in 70% yield. Acetyl chloride is not expected to exist in nature, because contact with water would hydrolyze it into acetic acid and hydrogen chloride. In fact, if handled in open air it releases white "smoke" resulting from hydrolysis due to the moisture in the air. The smoke is actually small droplets of hydrochloric acid formed by hydrolysis. It is a chemical for acetylation in the synthesis or derivatization of organic compounds. Examples of acetylation reactions include acylation processes such as esterification (see below) and the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Frequently such acylations are carried out in the presence of a base such as pyridine, triethylamine, or DMAP, which act as catalysts to help promote the reaction and as bases neutralize the resulting HCl. Such reactions will often proceed via ketene. Acetylation is the introduction of an acetyl group via acylation using a reactant such as acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride. An acetyl group is an acyl group having the formula For further information on the types of chemical reactions compounds such as acetyl chloride can undergo, see acyl halide.
