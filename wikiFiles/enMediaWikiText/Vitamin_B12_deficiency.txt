 {{DISPLAYTITLE:Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency}} Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency or hypocobalaminemia is a low blood level of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. It can cause permanent damage to nervous tissue if left untreated longer than 6 months. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> itself was discovered through investigation of pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disease that destroys parietal cells in the stomach that secrete intrinsic factor. Pernicious anemia, if left untreated, is usually fatal within three years. Once identified, however, the condition can be treated successfully and with relative ease, although it cannot be cured and ongoing treatment is required. Humans obtain almost all of their vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from dietary means. Pernicious anemia is usually the result of insufficient secretion of intrinsic factor within the stomach. Other more subtle types of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency have been elucidated, including the biochemical effects, over the course of time in significant numbers. The results of the Framingham Offspring Study indicate that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency may be more common than was previously believed. Deficiency is most significantly linked to improper absorption rather than low consumption, as many who consume high amounts of B<sub>12</sub> may still experience deficiency. The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in the body is between two and five mg in adults. Approximately 50% is stored in the liver, but approximately 0.1% is lost each day, due to secretions into the gut—not all of the vitamin in the gut is reabsorbed. While bile is the main vehicle for B<sub>12</sub> excretion, most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in bile is recycled via enterohepatic circulation. Due to the extreme efficiency of this mechanism, the liver can store three to five years worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> under normal conditions and functioning. However, the rate at which B<sub>12</sub> levels may change when dietary intake is low depends on the balance between several variables: Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency has the following pathomorphology, signs, and symptoms: Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes particular changes to the metabolism of 2 clinically relevant substances in humans: Methionine is activated to S-adenosyl methionine, which aids in purine and thymidine synthesis, myelin production, protein/neurotransmitters/fatty acid/phospholipid production and DNA methylation. 5-Methyl tetrahydrofolate provides a methyl group, which is released to the reaction with homocysteine, resulting in methionine. This reaction requires cobalamin as a cofactor. The creation of 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate is an irreversible reaction. If B<sub>12</sub> is absent, the forward reaction of homocysteine to methionine does not occur, and the replenishment of tetrahydrofolate stops. Because B<sub>12</sub> and folate are involved in the metabolism of homocysteine, hyperhomocysteinuria is a non-specific marker of deficiency. Methylmalonic acid is used as a more specific test of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. A spongiform state of neural tissue along with edema of fibers and deficiency of tissue. The myelin decays, along with axial fiber. In later phases, fibric sclerosis of nervous tissues occurs. Those changes apply to dorsal parts of the spinal cord and to pyramidal tracts in lateral cords. The pathophysiologic state of the spinal cord is called subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord. In the brain itself, changes are less severe: They occur as small sources of nervous fibers decay and accumulation of astrocytes, usually subcortically located, and also round hemorrhages with a torus of glial cells. Pathological changes can be noticed as well in the posterior roots of the cord and, to lesser extent, in peripheral nerves. The main syndrome of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is Biermer's disease (pernicious anemia). It is characterized by a triad of symptoms: Each of those symptoms can occur either alone or along with others. The neurological complex, defined as myelosis funicularis, consists of the following symptoms: Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency can cause severe and irreversible damage, especially to the brain and nervous system. These symptoms of neuronal damage may not reverse after correction of hematological abnormalities, and the chance of complete reversal decreases with the length of time the neurological symptoms have been present. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency symptoms also include shortness of breath and increased pallor. At levels only slightly lower than normal, a range of symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and poor memory may be experienced. However, these symptoms by themselves are too nonspecific to diagnose deficiency of the vitamin. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency can also cause symptoms of mania and psychosis, fatigue, memory impairment, irritability, depression and personality changes.<ref name="imajvitaminb12"> In infants symptoms include irritability, failure to thrive, apathy, anorexia, and developmental regression. A number of diseases not classically thought to be caused by B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are epidemiologically associated with it, raising questions of whether B<sub>12</sub> status is an independent risk-factor, or a partial causal agent in these states. None of these causal connections have been proved, and all are under active investigation. B<sub>12</sub> status may be associated with the onset and cause of Alzheimer's disease. Some studies have found no relationship, while several recent studies indicate a relationship between B<sub>12</sub>, homocysteine, and Alzheimer's. B<sub>12</sub> status is routinely measured at the time of Alzheimer's diagnosis, and there is some indication that ongoing measurements may be useful to detect the development of a severe deficiency. In addition to checking serum B<sub>12</sub>, checking the levels of other compounds (particularly methylmalonic acid) may be necessary to accurately detect a deficiency state, because serum levels do not necessarily correlate with efficient utilization of B<sub>12</sub>. A relationship between clinical depression levels and deficient B<sub>12</sub> blood levels in elderly people is documented in the literature. Serum B<sub>12</sub> levels are often low in B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, but if other features of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are present with normal B<sub>12</sub> then further investigation is warranted. One possible explanation for normal B<sub>12</sub> levels in B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is antibody interference in people with high titres of intrinsic factor antibody.Some researchers propose that the current standard norms of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels are too low.In Japan, the lowest acceptable level for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in blood has been raised from about 200 pg/mL (145 pM) to 550 pg/mL (400 pM). Serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub> tests results are in pg/mL (picograms/millilitre) or pmol/L (picomoles/litre). The laboratory reference ranges for these units are similar, since the molecular weight of B<sub>12</sub> is approximately 1000, the difference between mL and L. Thus: 550 pg/mL = 400 pmol/L. Serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels are considered more reliable indicators of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency than the concentration of B<sub>12</sub> in blood. The levels of these substances are high in B<sub>12</sub> deficiency and can be helpful if the diagnosis is unclear. Approximately 10% of patients with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels between 200–400pg/l will have a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency on the basis of elevated levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. Routine monitoring of methylmalonic acid levels in urine is an option for people who may not be getting enough dietary B<sub>12</sub>, as a rise in methylmalonic acid levels may be an early indication of deficiency. If nervous system damage is suspected, B<sub>12</sub> analysis in cerebrospinal fluid is possible, though such an invasive test should be considered only if blood testing is inconclusive. The Schilling test has been largely supplanted by tests for antiparietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. B<sub>12</sub> can be supplemented in healthy subjects by oral pill; sublingual pill, liquid, or strip; intranasal spray; transdermal patch or by injection. B<sub>12</sub> is available singly or in combination with other supplements. B<sub>12</sub> supplements are available in forms including cyanocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin (sometimes called "cobamamide" or "dibencozide"). Oral treatments involve giving 250 µg to 1 mg of B<sub>12</sub> daily. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can be given as intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of hydroxycobalamin, methylcobalamin, or cyanocobalamin. Body stores (in the liver) are partly repleted with half a dozen injections in the first couple of weeks (full repletion of liver stores requires about 20 injections) and then maintenance with monthly injections throughout the life of the patient. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can also be easily self-administered by injection by the patient, using the same fine-gauge needles and syringes used for self-administration of insulin. B<sub>12</sub> has traditionally been given parenterally (by injection) to ensure absorption. However, oral replacement is now an accepted route, as it has become increasingly appreciated that sufficient quantities of B<sub>12</sub> are absorbed when large doses are given. This absorption does not rely on the presence of intrinsic factor or an intact ileum. Generally 1 to 2 mg daily is required as a large dose. By contrast, the typical Western diet contains 5–7 µg of B<sub>12</sub> (Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Daily Value ). It has been appreciated since the 1960s that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in adults resulting from malabsorption (including loss of intrinsic factor) can be treated with oral B<sub>12</sub> supplements when given in sufficient doses. When given in oral doses ranging from 0.1–2 mg daily, B<sub>12</sub> can be absorbed in a pathway that does not require an intact ileum or intrinsic factor. In two studies, oral treatment with 2 mg per day was as effective as monthly 1 mg injections. Hypokalemia, an excessively low potassium level in the blood, is anecdotally reported as a complication of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> repletion after deficiency. Excessive quantities of potassium are used by newly growing and dividing hematopoietic cells, depleting circulating stores of the mineral. Research has established the effectiveness of other routes of B<sub>12</sub> administration, primarily intranasal and sublingual dosing, but neither has been proven to be superior to oral dosing; recommendations are based on a consumers individual circumstances. The sublingual route, in which B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed under the tongue, is manufactured in a variety of forms, such as lozenges, pills, and lollipops. A 2003 study found no significant difference in absorption for serum levels from oral vs. sublingual delivery of 500 µg (micrograms) of cobalamin, although the study measured only serum levels as opposed to tissue levels, which is more reflective of B<sub>12</sub> levels. Sublingual methods of replacement may be effective only because of the typically high doses (500 micrograms), which are swallowed, not because of placement of the tablet. As noted below, such very high doses of oral B<sub>12</sub> may be effective as treatments, even if gastro-intestinal tract absorption is impaired by gastric atrophy (pernicious anemia). Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can be found in large quantities in animal products, including meat, poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, and dairy products; and the consumption of these products is the most longstanding method by which human beings have taken vitamin B<sub>12</sub> into their systems. Bioavailability of B<sub>12</sub> in eggs is low (<9%) compared to other animal food sources. B<sub>12</sub> vitamin levels in different dietary sources are listed by the recommended dietary allowance per 100g serving of a particular food source. Some animal foods that have high vitamin B<sub>12</sub> content per 100g serving (% in RDA) are as follows:Mackerel 317%,Herring 312%,Salmon 302%,Liverwurst Sausage 224%,Crab 192%,Tuna 181%,Goose Liver 157%,Emu Steak 156%,Bluefish 104,Beef (lean fat part) 103%,New England Clam Chowder 80%,Lobster 67%,Lamb (shoulder part) 62%,Swiss Cheese 56%,Manhattan Clam Chowder 55%,Chicken eggs 33%. Since B<sub>12</sub> is produced by bacteria, it is possible that it can be obtained in some bacterially fermented foods such as traditional Korean foods. However, this has not yet be rigorously proven. Certain makers of kombucha cultured tea, such as GT's Kombucha, list vitamin B<sub>12</sub> as naturally present in their product. One brand purports to contain 20 percent of the Daily Value of B<sub>12</sub> in a single bottle, making kombucha a potential "high" food source of B<sub>12</sub>. Because kombucha is produced by a symbiosis between yeast and bacteria, the possibility that kombucha contains B<sub>12</sub> does not contradict current knowledge. But no scientific studies have yet been published confirming the fact, nor whether the B<sub>12</sub> in kombucha is the biologically active B<sub>12</sub>. A Japanese fermented black tea known as Batabata-cha has been found to contain biologically active B<sub>12</sub>. Unlike kombucha which is made by fermenting already prepared tea, Batabata-cha is fermented while still in the tea leaf state. Unconventional natural sources of B<sub>12</sub> also exist, but their utility as food sources of B<sub>12</sub> are doubtful. For example, plants pulled from the ground and not washed scrupulously may contain remnants of B<sub>12</sub> from the bacteria present in the surrounding soil. B<sub>12</sub> is also found in lakes if the water has not been sanitized. Certain insects such as termites contain B<sub>12</sub> produced by their gut bacteria, in a way analogous to ruminant animals. The human intestinal tract itself may contain B<sub>12</sub> producing bacteria in the small intestine, but it is unclear whether sufficient amounts of the vitamin could be produced to meet nutritional needs. Foods fortified with B<sub>12</sub> are also sources of the vitamin although they cannot be regarded as true food sources of B<sub>12</sub> since the vitamin is added in supplement form, from commercial bacterial production sources, such as cyanocobalamin. Examples of B<sub>12</sub>-fortified foods include fortified breakfast cereals, fortified soy products, fortified energy bars, and fortified nutritional yeast. The UK Vegan Society, the Vegetarian Resource Group, and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, among others, deny that non-animal food sources of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are reliable and recommend that every vegan who is not supplementing consume B<sub>12</sub>-fortified foods. Not all of these may contain labeled amounts of vitamin activity. Supplemental B<sub>12</sub> added to beverages in one study was found to degrade to contain varying levels of pseudovitamin-B<sub>12</sub>. One report has found B<sub>12</sub> analogues present in varying amounts in some multivitamins. So-called pseudovitamin-B<sub>12</sub> refers to B<sub>12</sub>-like analogues that are biologically inactive in humans and yet found to be present alongside B<sub>12</sub> in humans, many food sources (including animals), and possibly supplements and fortified foods. In most cyanobacterium, including Spirulina, and some algae, such as dried Asakusa-nori (Porphyra tenera), pseudovitamin-B12 is found to predominate. The UK Vegan Society, the Vegetarian Resource Group, and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, among others, recommend that vegans either consistently eat B<sub>12</sub>-fortified foods or take a daily or weekly B<sub>12</sub> supplement to meet the recommended intake. It is important for vegans, who possess limited food sources of B<sub>12</sub>, and anyone else wishing to obtain B<sub>12</sub> from food sources other than animals, to consume foods that contain little or no pseudovitamin-B<sub>12</sub> and are high in biologically active B<sub>12</sub>. However, there have been no significant human trials of sufficient size to demonstrate enzymatic activity of B<sub>12</sub> from nonbacterial sources, such as Chlorella and edible sea algae (seaweeds, such as lavers), although chemically some of these sources have been reported to contain B<sub>12</sub> that seems chemically identical to active vitamin. However, among these sources, only fresh sea algea such as Susabi-nori (Porphyra yezoensis) have been reported to demonstrated vitamin B<sub>12</sub> activity in B<sub>12</sub> deficient rats. This has yet to be demonstrated for Chlorella, and no study in rats of any algal B<sub>12</sub> source has yet to be confirmed by a second independent study. The possibility of algae-derived active forms of B<sub>12</sub> presently remains an active topic of research, with no results that have yet reached consensus in the nutritional community. A study in the year 2000 indicates that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is far more widespread than formerly believed. The study found that 39 percent of studied group of 3,000 had low values. This study at Tufts University used the B<sub>12</sub> concentration 258 pmol/l (= 350 pg/mL) as a criterion of "low level". However, a recent research has found that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency may occur at a much higher B<sub>12</sub> concentration (500–600 pg/mL). On this basis Mitsuyama and Kogoh proposed 550 pg/mL, and Tiggelen et al. proposed 600 pg/mL. Against this background, there are reasons to believe that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is present in a far greater proportion of the population than 39% as reported by Tufts University. In the developing world the deficiency is very widespread, with significant levels of deficiency in Africa, India, and South and Central America. This is theorized to be due to low intakes of animal products, particularly among the poor, though data from WHO publications on world food consumption point to a large deficiency of poor populations in consuming adequate amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables, which carry B<sub>12</sub> from bacteria in the soil they are grown in, so this is likely a primary cause as well, since vitamin B<sub>12</sub> does not originate from animal sources and can be obtained without consuming animal products. B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is more common in the elderly. This is because B<sub>12</sub> absorption decreases greatly in the presence of atrophic gastritis, which is common in the elderly. A 1982 American study found that among 83 volunteer subjects, 92% of the vegans, 64% of the lactovegetarians, 47% of the lacto-ovovegetarians, and 20% of the semivegetarians had serum B<sub>12</sub> levels less than 200 pg/ml. "However," the researchers said, "their complete blood count values did not deviate greatly from those found for nonvegetarians, even though some had been vegans or lactovegetarians for over 10 years. Macrocytosis among the vegetarians was minimal; none had a mean corpuscular volume greater than 103 fl." The 2000 Tufts University study found no correlation between eating meat and differences in B<sub>12</sub> serum levels. The National Institutes of Health has found that "Large amounts of folic acid can mask the damaging effects of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency by correcting the megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency without correcting the neurological damage that also occurs", there are also indications that "high serum folate levels might not only mask vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, but could also exacerbate the anemia and worsen the cognitive symptoms associated with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency". Due to the fact that in the United States legislation has required enriched flour to contain folic acid to reduce cases of fetal neural-tube defects, consumers may be ingesting more than they realize. To counter the masking effect of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency the NIH recommends "folic acid intake from fortified food and supplements should not exceed 1,000 mcg daily in healthy adults." Most importantly, B<sub>12</sub> deficiency needs to be treated with B<sub>12</sub> repletion. Limiting folic acid will not counter the irrevocable neurological damage that is caused by untreated B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.
