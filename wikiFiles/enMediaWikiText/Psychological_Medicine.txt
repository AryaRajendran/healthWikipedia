 Psychological Medicine is a peer-reviewed medical journal in the field of psychiatry and related aspects of psychology and basic sciences. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2010 impact factor of 6.159. The journal was established by Michael Shepherd in 1969 and he remained its editor until 1993. It is interesting to note that Shepherd favoured the term "Psychological Medicine" over "Psychiatry" and he attached great importance to the title which he resurrected from the "Journal of Psychological Medicine", first conceived by Forbes Winslow. He defined psychological medicine as including not only to psychiatry, but also to the study of abnormal behaviour. He concentrated on original high-quality works across the wide spectrum of both psychiatry and its allied disciplines. Shepherd contributed extensively himself, investing much time and care towards the journal's success. According to his successor, Psychological Medicine was to become perhaps Shepherd's greatest and most enduring creation set in an already highly distinguished academic and research career.
