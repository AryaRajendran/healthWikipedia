 The United States experienced the beginnings of a pandemic of a novel strain of the Influenza A/H1N1 virus, commonly referred to as "swine flu", in the spring of 2009. The earliest reported cases in the US began appearing in late March 2009 in California, then spreading to infect people in Texas, New York, and other states by mid-April. Early cases were associated with recent travel to Mexico; many were students who had traveled to Mexico for Spring Break. This spread continued across the country's population and by the end of May there were approximately 0 confirmed cases throughout all 50 states. On April 28, 2009, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first official US death of swine flu, a 23-month-old toddler from Mexico who died on April 27 while visiting Texas.By June 24, 132 deaths had been attributed to the virus.As of January 11, 2010, at least 13,837 deaths were attributed to the virus worldwide, and at least 2290 deaths in the US were confirmed to be due to the virus. The CDC suspects, however, that the total number of deaths in the US is much higher than the official total, as some deaths probably went unconfirmed. On May 2, 2009, the Alabama Department of Public Health confirmed the first case of H1N1 (swine flu) in Madison, Alabama, one of two probable cases previously identified at an elementary school in Madison. As a result, all public schools and most private schools and daycare centers in Madison County, Alabama, including the cities of Huntsville and Madison, closed for two days. After meeting with the state public health officer on May 3, 2009, all Madison city elementary schools were to be closed through May 13, 2009, but were reopened after the CDC updated its guidance to schools. As of December 5, 2009, the Alabama Department of Public Health reports 2453 confirmed and 36 deaths from swine flu. As of January 9, 2010, Alabama was the only US state reporting widespread A/H1N1 flu activity. On May 10, 2009, the Alaska state Division of Public Health reported the state's first probable case of swine flu in a crew member of a Royal Caribbean cruise ship traveling in Alaska waters. On May 12, they confirmed that the woman had been infected with swine flu but they do not consider it to be Alaska's first case because she became ill before entering state waters. As of December 5, 460 cases of swine flu and 11 deaths were confirmed in Alaska.On July 27, Alaska health officials confirmed the first H1N1-related death. As of October 31, the Arizona Department of Health Services had reported a total of 6,302 confirmed cases of H1N1 infection since April 2009, with at least one case reported in each of the state's 15 counties. 786 of the cases had resulted in hospitalization of the patient, and 81 deaths were associated with H1N1 infection in that period of time. Of the H1N1 associated deaths reported in the state, 72% suffered an underlying medical condition (asthma, lung or heart conditions, cancer, metabolic disorders, pregnancy, immunosuppressive disorders, neurologic diseases or other chronic diseases) at the time of death. On April 28, the first cases of H1N1 influenza infection in Arizona were confirmed in four school-aged patients in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The schools attended by the patients were immediately closed following recommendations from the CDC; after only 3 days, however, local authorities reopened the schools, stating that the H1N1 flu appeared to be no more deadly than the seasonal flu. School closures in the area have since been eliminated in favor of simply sending the infected children home, resulting in slightly elevated absence rates statewide. The first death in the state due to H1N1 swine flu complications was reported by the Maricopa County Department of Public Health on May 14.As of January 15, Arizona has reported 142 deaths due to confirmed A/H1N1 influenza,including at least 2 in 2010 alone. As of July 16, 2009, the Arkansas Department of Health has reported 51 confirmed cases of swine flu. Four of the cases were from Camp Robinson, a US Army National Guard base located in North Little Rock in Pulaski County. Deaths by county:<div style="-moz-column-count:3;-webkit-column-count:3; column-count:3;"> </div> The first two cases detected in the US were two children living in San Diego County and Imperial County (a county in which 18% of their residents are not U.S. citizens),who became ill on March 28 and 30 respectively. A CDC alert concerning these two isolated cases was reported in the media on April 21. As of April 24 eight human cases were known in the US, including six in Southern California. The patients have recovered. The acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said that preliminary tests on seven out of fourteen samples from patients in Mexico had matched the virus found in the US, which experts say is a new strain of swine flu. None of the US patients had any contact with pigs, leading CDC officials to believe that human-to-human transmission has been occurring. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the state of California activated the Joint Emergency Operations Center of the Department of Public Health, and are coordinating with the California Emergency Management Agency, the CDC, and the Mexican government. They have additionally stepped up other preparations to lessen the flu's threat. On April 28, Gov. Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency which allows the state to deploy additional resources to the Department of Public Health and more quickly and easily purchase equipment and materials. St. Mels Catholic School in Fair Oaks was closed after Sacramento County Health Department notified the school that a 7th grade student who reportedly recently returned from a family vacation in Mexico tested positive for an unidentified strain of Influenzavirus A. On April 27, CDC officials confirmed that the student tested positive for swine flu. In Marin County, a grandmother and her 20-month-old granddaughter have been confirmed to have the flu. By April 28, the CDC had confirmed 10 cases of swine flu in California. California State University, Long Beach reported on April 29 that a student had returned a "probable positive" test result for swine influenza. The student showed symptoms on Sunday April 26 and went to the campus health services office the following day. The test results were received by the school on April 28 and distributed to all students and faculty. The affected student had not attended any classes since falling ill and has an apparently mild case of the disease that does not appear life threatening. Three high schools in Riverside County were closed April 29 after two teenage girls, from Corona and Indio respectively, were confirmed to have contracted the virus. Branham High School in San Jose was closed that day for a week after one teenage girl was confirmed to be a probable case. Rucker Elementary School in Gilroy is set to be closed on Friday, May 1 after at least one student was being tested after exhibiting flu-like symptoms. Three students at the Grizzly Youth Academy in San Luis Obispo are confirmed cases of swine influenza. As many as 73 students are exhibiting flu-like symptoms at The Academy and are assumed to have the virus. All are being isolated. The Academy is set to stay open. On May 3, 2009, parent of students attending King Middle School in Berkeley were notified that their school would be closed down due to a swine flu outbreak involving students at the school. Days later, other schools were closed down because of students or staff exhibiting flu-like symptoms; for example, Sunnyside Elementary School and Woodville Elementary School, both in Tulare County. On June 1, 2009, the first two deaths were confirmed, one by a middle-aged man in San Bernardino County, and another one by a middle-aged woman in Los Angeles County. A third death was confirmed on June 4, when a nine-year-old girl from Contra Costa County died. They were followed by an Orange County man's death on June 8 and a middle-aged man's death in Alameda County on June 9. As of June 9, there were 973 confirmed cases, 266 probable cases, and five deaths caused by the H1N1 flu. On June 10, another middle-aged man died in Alameda County, thus making it the third death in the San Francisco Bay Area. On July 1, a woman who had been hospitalized in Marin County died of swine flu. As of July 23, 2009, 2,655 cases and 61 deaths in California had been confirmed. A list of hospitalizations and deaths can be viewed at the California Department of Health Website. As of mid-September 2009, California had 2655 cases and 152 deaths.As of January 15, at least 479 California residents had died from confirmed H1N1 infection. On April 30 two cases of the flu virus were confirmed in the state of Colorado. The confirmed cases were a woman from Arapahoe County who recently returned from a cruise to Mexico and a Denver International Airport baggage handler. Two more H1N1 influenza cases were confirmed on May 2, both in Jefferson County, Colorado. One case is a middle school student, which has caused the school he attends to close for a week. The tally increased to seven on May 4 when The University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) confirmed three of its students contracted the virus. There were 171 cases reported in Colorado as of July 18.On July 29, 2009 Colorado reported its first A(H1N1) swine flu death in El Paso County of a woman in her forties. On April 28, it was announced that there were suspected cases of swine flu in three Connecticut towns.

On September 29, 2009, The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare confirmed that a Canyon County man in his 50s, with an already existing medical condition, died from the H1N1 virus, by which time 488 cases had been confirmed. By late October the H1N1 vaccine was available for high-risk groups for whom H&W; set up clinics and distribution centers in, among other places, defunct big box stores. By December 10, 2009, there had been 812 laboratory-confirmed cases, 381 influenza-related hospitalizations (most of them of children under ten), and 18 deaths. Furthermore, the vaccine became readily available to the general public under 65. By December 30, 2009 the state had 824 laboratory-confirmed cases since September 1, and the virus had contributed to the deaths of 20 people. By January 23, 2010 despite at least 23 Idaho deaths and 385 hospitalizations and the widespread availabilityof the H1N1 vaccine, only 10% to 15% of the populace of Ada County had been inoculated, prompting concern amongst public health officials. The state's first probable case of swine flu was reported on Wednesday, April 29. An elementary school in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood, on the city's Far North Side, was closed because a 12-year-old student was presumed to have the disease. The student reportedly was recovering at home. By April 30, over 40 probable cases had been identified by state and local health officials. In addition to 16 cases in the city of Chicago, and 11 in surrounding Cook County, cases were reported in Kane, Lake, DuPage, McHenry, and Will counties. Several schools in the affected areas were temporarily closed. Many other flu cases happened during or even before the launch of the alert were then confirmed, principally in the urban area of Chicago. By May 20, the following 17 counties had confirmed cases: Boone, Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Franklin, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Knox, Lake, McDonough, McHenry, Ogle, Sangamon, Will, Williamson, and Winnebago. Total confirmed cases in Illinois were 794, up from 707 the previous day. Cases in Illinois throughout May 2009 continued to climb and by May 31, 2009 the published CDC numbers had reached 1002 confirmed cases with 2 deaths. A third confirmed death – the first outside of the Chicago metropolitan area – was reported by state health authorities on May 28, 2009 but this was not reflected in the CDC official numbers by the end of the month. A total of 3,366 cases and 17 deaths have been confirmed in Illinois as of July 24.As of January 2010,a total of 2931 hospitalizations due to confirmed A/H1N1 infection and a total of 97 confirmed deaths due to H1N1 have been reported in Illinois. On April 28, an unidentified Notre Dame student was confirmed as the first case of swine flu in this state. The patient had not recently traveled to Mexico or been in contact with anyone who has traveled to Mexico. The student was in voluntarily quarantine, and was doing well, according to Judy Monroe, Indiana's state health commissioner. Two other cases in the state which occurred in two Indianapolis elementary schools were confirmed by the CDC shortly thereafter. Additional cases later surfaced in the counties of Hendricks, Lake, Marion, Putnam, St. Joseph, and Tippecanoe. On July 10, 2009, a young teenager died of Swine Flu, this was the first death in Indiana because of this disease. As of July 24, the CDC has reported 291 cases of swine flu.As of February 2010, there have been at least 38 confirmed deaths due to A/H1N1 infection. Also, since September 1, there have been at least 468 confirmed cases of H1N1 in Indiana. On April 29, two probable case of swine flu were reported in Des Moines County and Clinton County. One was a woman from California, the other one was a man from Mexico. On May 3, another case was found in Marshall County causing schools to close. On the week of February 28, 2009, a three year old caught the swine flu due to close contact with ill pigs, but not the same dangerous strain that came from Mexico. In early May, cases climbed up to 43. A few were in Polk County, where Des Moines is. As of July 24, 165 cases have been reported by the CDC. In Iowa City's Iowa City High School, there were over 400 students absent on Oct. 7 with suspected H1N1. The recent homecoming dance is credited with causing this. The school's 9-day absence limit is also believed to have influenced this, restricting sick students from going home if they have already been absent 9 days. The school has refused to close despite protests from parents, teachers and students alike. On October 9, 32% of all students were absent out of over 1,600. The school has continued to stay open despite advisement by the Johnson County Health Department even as more and more of the student population falls ill. There are serious concerns of students passing along the virus to the community, creating a large local outbreak. As of October 15 the school is still open. Health officials in Kansas announced April 25 that two new cases of swine flu had been confirmed in Dickinson County, after both were isolated. The week prior, one patient had traveled to Mexico by plane to attend a professional conference; both he and his wife experienced minor influenza symptoms. As of July 24, 2009 there were 213 confirmed cases of swine flu in Kansas, 101 in adults and 112 in children. However, in Wyandotte and Johnson counties the state had instructed that only hospitalized patients needed to be tested so the numbers were quite possibly higher. By June 30, 2009 there were 129 confirmed swine flu cases in Kansas.As of January 9,26 people have died of infection with H1N1,including a healthy 52 year old man with no underlying health problems that would place him at higher risk for A/H1N1 infection.also,a 6 year old Kansas boy and 27 year old Kansas woman, have also died from infection with H1N1,reinforcing the fact that young,healthy people can die from infection with A/H1N1,and that vaccination is recommended even for those without preexisting medical problems. A Warren County woman who had recently visited Mexico tested positive for the virus April 30. After returning to Kentucky from Mexico, she traveled to Georgia where she was hospitalized. Health officials from both states announced this as the first confirmed case in their states, however the CDC listed the case in Kentucky. In Jefferson County, Meyzeek Middle school has three cases of H1N1 Influenza. This initially started from a staff member, but spread to students. As of July 21, there are a total of 232 swine flu cases confirmed by The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. Up from 114 reported on May 28. As of January 2010, 1,973 confirmed cases of H1N1 have been reported,and 43 H1N1 deaths have been confirmed, in Louisiana. On April 29, three cases of H1N1 (swine flu) were confirmed in Maine, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control. The three adults, two from Kennebec County and one from York County, were reported to be recovering at home. Dr. Dora Anne Mills, former director of Maine CDC, said on April 28 that at least 12 suspected cases were being tested. Late on April 29, Maine Governor John Baldacci declared a "civil emergency" and ordered a school and daycare facility in York County to close for seven days. As of July 22, there have been 282 cases confirmed throughout Maine. As of November 26, 1562 confirmed cases, 97 hospitalized cases, and 9 deaths have been reported in Maine. Also, 172 schools have reported outbreaks of H1N1 since May, according to Dr. Dora Anne Mills and the Maine CDC. On December 2, 2009, it was announced that H1N1 has killed 2 more Mainers, bringing the death toll to 11. As of December 17, 2009, the Maine CDC states that although 203 Mainers have now been hospitalized and the death toll has risen to 17 in Maine, H1N1 flu activity is decreasing in Maine, and vaccine availability is increasing rapidly, so all Mainers can now get the vaccine. Dr. Dora Anne Mills reminded Mainers that 150 Mainers die every year from regular influenza. As of December 24, 2009, Maine was one of the only 7 states reporting widespread influenza activity, though Maine's influenza activity was declining as well. As of January 7, 2010, H1N1 activity has decreased from widespread to regional for the first time since October 17, 2009. Although H1N1 activity in Maine has declined for the time being, H1N1 continues to circulate in Maine. H1N1 could return later this year, so it is still very important to get vaccinated against A/H1N1 influenza, Dr. Dora Anne Mills says. So far, 18 deaths, 225 hospitalizations, and 2220 cases have been confirmed. As of January 14, the CDC states just 3 more patients required hospital care due to H1N1 disease, no new deaths occurred, and only 6 new cases were confirmed. However, one outbreak in a long term care facility was confirmed. As of January 28, H1N1 activity has decreased significantly, with the CDC classifying current influenza activity as sporadic. No new cases of A/H1N1 influenza were confirmed between January 21 and January 28. However, as of February 4, the Maine CDC reports that influenza activity has increased enough for the state to be again classified as having regional influenza activity, and that one person had died of confirmed A/H1N1 infection over the previous week, bringing the number of confirmed deaths from A/H1N1 to 19 in the state. By May 1, 2009, eleven probable cases had been identified in Maryland, in Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Charles, Prince George's, and Montgomery Counties. One of these cases, that of a high school student in Rockville, resulted in the closing of Rockville High School, the first Maryland school closing due to the outbreak. On May 1, three other schools in the state were closed. As of May 5, Rockville High School has reopened. Takoma Park Middle School also began to take action due to a student catching swine flu. Four of Maryland's probable cases were confirmed on May 4, including two adults and one child in Baltimore County as well as one young child in Anne Arundel county. There are 4 cases of swine flu in Worcester County Public Schools in Maryland.In Washington County in Northeast Maryland there were lots of cases of the Swine Flu almost causing to close down 4 Schools. As of Fall 2009, there have been 954 confirmed cases in Maryland. In late September 2009 a 13-year-old Baltimore resident became the first minor to die from swine flu in Maryland. As of December 2, oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 was confirmed in Maryland. As of January 12, 2010, 43 confirmed deaths from H1N1 have been reported, and at least 969 patients have been hospitalized with A/H1N1 virus infection in Maryland. There are 1,398 confirmed cases in Massachusetts, 172 of which have led to hospitalizations. The first death from swine flu in Massachusetts occurred on June 14, 2009 when a 30-year-old Boston woman died. Eleven deaths have been confirmed as being caused by the H1N1 virus in total. On April 29, a 34-year-old woman from Livingston County was Michigan's first reported case of swine flu. As of June 13, Michigan reports 655 confirmed flu cases, and as of July 23, nine deaths. The health department has since stopped reporting cases but continues to update deaths. The first death in Michigan was of a 53-year-old woman who lived in Warren and had other under-lying health problems. The second Michigan death occurred in Roscommon County. As of August 10, 2009, ten deaths have been reported in Michigan due to the H1N1 virus. Michigan has stopped keeping a running tally of confirmed cases. On October 28, 2009 157 schools in Michigan were closed due to the swine flu. On April 30, 2009, the Minnesota Department of Health announced that the first case of "H1N1 novel influenza virus" in the state was confirmed by the CDC. The infected individual is an unidentified resident of Cold Spring, Minnesota. Two schools in the affected city will remain closed until May 6, 2009. On May 4, 2009 the second case of H1N1 was confirmed in Minnesota by the Minnesota Department of Health. The case was reported in a teen boy attending a Minneapolis Public School. A Minneapolis five year old girl had succumbed to the flu during the week of June 8. As of July 23, 684 cases and three deaths have been reported.As of January 13,2 more people died of confirmed A/H1N1 influenza,increasing the number of confirmed deathsfrom H1N1 to 55 in the state.However,H1N1 influenza activity is currently low in Minnesota,with only one school outbreak reported in the first week of 2010. In Missouri, Gov. Jay Nixon announced in a written statement that a probable case had been discovered in a Platte County man, and that a sample had been sent to the CDC for confirmation.

On June 11, 2009, a teenager from New Bloomfield (11 miles north of the Jefferson City) in Callaway County became the 50th confirmed case of H1N1 in Missouri. On June 20, 2009, about 20 to 30 campers at a Lake of the Ozarks summer camp in Morgan County reported having mild flu-like symptoms, of which two cases were confirmed to be H1N1. The camp was closed down for a week. Another summer camp in Stone County near Branson reported at least 15 campers who have tested positive for the flu in preliminary tests on June 24. The preliminary results were possibly sent to a lab in neighboring Taney County as local reporters attempted to dispute or deny that any flu cases were reported in Taney County by going as far as to cite that the Taney County Health Department found zero cases of the flu. Official results from the DHSS confirm the camp had five campers with H1N1, but that all the campers were from out of state. Reports from Adair, Buchanan, and Jefferson County were added on June 25 to DHSS's list of confirmed cases, bringing the count to 58 cases. These reports may be based on where people with H1N1 are from rather than where it was located in relation to the H1N1 cases reported at summer camps. The youngest case of H1N1 was confirmed by DHSS in Cole County on June 25, 2009. An infant was reported with having Flu-like symptoms which was confirmed by DHSS.

The Mississippi State Department of Health continues to monitor and investigate human cases of a new type of influenza, H1N1 swine influenza (also known as "novel H1N1 influenza") now present in Mississippi. Symptoms of swine flu in humans are similar to those of seasonal flu, causing fever, respiratory symptoms and body aches. H1N1 swine flu has contributed to a number of deaths nationwide, principally in those with pre-existing health conditions. 898 Mississippi cases of H1N1 swine flu have been identified and 7 deaths since May 15. Mississippians are advised to continue to exercise protective hygiene to avoid illness.As January 25,14 Mississippians have died of the H1N1 flu,and more than 635 cases have been confirmed.
