 Bone Medical is a small Perth-based biopharmaceutical company aiming to develop medicines for bone and joint disease. Located in Technology Park (Bentley), Perth, it focuses on orally administered preparations for treatment of osteoporosis and arthritis. Since July 2007, its non-executive independent director has been Prof. Peter Brooks. , the company was utilising technologies under licence from Proxima Concepts Ltd of Jersey, Channel Islands, in two clinical-trial projects aimed at improving administration of hormone replacement. One explores use of oral calcitonin for treatment of bone disease including osteoporosis; the other explores oral administration of parathyroid hormone, a controlling agent for the maintenance of normal calcium levels in the blood. Substitution of the latter for injected parathyroid hormone would potentially enhance accessibility and patient acceptance.
