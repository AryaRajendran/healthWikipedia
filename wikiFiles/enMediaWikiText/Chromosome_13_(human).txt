 Chromosome 13 is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 13 spans about 114 million base pairs (the building material of DNA) and represents between 3.5 and 4% of the total DNA in cells. Identifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the number of genes varies. Chromosome 13 likely contains between 300 and 700 genes. The following are some of the genes located on chromosome 13: The following diseases are some of those related to genes on chromosome 13: The following conditions are caused by changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 13:
