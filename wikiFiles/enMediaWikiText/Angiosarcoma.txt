 Angiosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm (cancer) of endothelial-type cells that line vessel walls. This may be in reference to blood (hemangiosarcoma) or lymphatic vessels (lymphangiosarcoma). Its origin typically readily permits metastases to distant sites. Most tumors of visceral blood and lymphatic vessel walls are malignant. Hemangiosarcomas and lymphangiosarcomas of the skin are not common. Angiosarcoma of the liver, a rare fatal tumor, has been seen in workers intensively exposed to the gas vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) for prolonged periods while working in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymerization plants. It has also been associated with individuals exposed to arsenic-containing insecticides and Thorotrast. In canines, however, angiosarcoma is relatively common, especially in larger breeds such as golden retrievers and labrador retrievers.
