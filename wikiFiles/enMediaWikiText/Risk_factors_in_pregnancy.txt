 Factors increasing the risk (to either the woman, the fetus/es, or both) of pregnancy beyond the normal level of risk may be present in a woman's medical profile either before she becomes pregnant or during the pregnancy. These pre-existing factors may relate to physical and/or mental health, and/or to social issues, or a combination. Some common factors include: Pre-existing disorders and/or congenital defects can increase the usual risks involved in pregnancy. In such circumstances, women who wish to continue with a pregnancy require extra medical care, often from an interdisciplinary team. Such a team might include (besides an obstetrician) a specialist in the disorder and other practitioners (for example, maternal-fetal specialists, nutritionists, etc.). These conditions include: Some disorders and conditions can mean that pregnancy is considered high-risk (about 6-8% of pregnancies in the USA) and in extreme cases may be contraindicated. High-risk pregnancies are the main focus of doctors specialising in maternal-fetal medicine. Serious pre-existing disorders which can reduce a woman's physical ability to survive pregnancy include a range of congenital defects (that is, conditions with which the woman herself was born, for example, those of the heart or reproductive organs, some of which are listed above) and diseases acquired at any time during the woman's life. A Dutch 2010 research showed that "low-risk" pregnancy in the Netherlands may actually carry a higher risk of perinatal death than a "high-risk" pregnancy. A medical news report observed, "Under the Dutch system of obstetric care, women with low-risk pregnancies are supervised by a midwife in primary care, with the choice of a home or hospital delivery, whereas those with potential complicating factors are supervised by an obstetrician throughout their pregnancy and given a hospital delivery".
