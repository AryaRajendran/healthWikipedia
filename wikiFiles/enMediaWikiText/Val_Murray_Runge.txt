 Val Murray Runge, MD (born August 28, 1956) is a Professor of radiology and the Editor-in-Chief of Investigative Radiology . Prof. Runge was one of the early researchers to investigate the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . He is an internationally-known clinician and researcher in the field of MRI, with expertise in intravenous contrast media and imaging techniques. Prof. Runge was born in Austin, Texas and attended Stanford University obtaining a bachelor of science degree in 1978 with honors. He subsequently received his MD from Stanford University School of Medicine in 1982. Following completion of a Diagnostic Radiology residency at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Runge was appointed as assistant professor and chief of service of magnetic resonance at Tufts University School of Medicine in 1986. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1988. In 1990 he was appointed Professor of Diagnostic Radiology and Biomedical Engineering, Director of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy Center, and the Rosenbaum Endowed Chair of Diagnostic Radiology, at the University of Kentucky Medical Center in Lexington. In 2002, Prof. Runge was appointed the Robert and Alma Moreton Centennial Chair in Radiology, [[Scott & White Memorial Hospital]], and Professor of Radiology at the [[Texas A&M; Health Science Center]]. In 2010 he was appointed theJohn Sealy Distinguished Chair and Professor of Radiology at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. In 2001, he received an additional appointment as a visiting professor at Tongji Medical College in Wuhan, China. Prof. Runge is currently on sabbatical. Prof. Runge is an early pioneer in MRI, known for his work in 1982-4, demonstrating publicly for the first time the potential as well as early diagnostic utility of intravenous contrast media in MRI, specifically the gadolinium chelates . He is an author of more than 200 peer-reviewed papers published in the scientific literature . He is also the editor for fourteen medical textbooks , with several of these translated into other languages, including German , Chinese, Polish and Turkish. He has given more than 600 scientific and invited presentations at national and international meetings and medical schools across North America, Europe, Australia, Japan, Korea and China over the past 25 years. Prof. Runge holds a U.S. patent (#4615879), together with Jeffrey A. Clanton, for particulate NMR contrast agents <ref name="clinical-mri">http://www.clinical-mri.com/DrRunge.html. Prof. Runge has been Editor-in-Chief since 1994 of Investigative Radiology, a peer-reviewed PubMed research journal . He has also been an editorial board member for the Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Topics in Magnetic Resonance Imaging since the inception of both journals. Prof. Runge remains active in research and development of MRI contrast agents and advanced MRI imaging techniques. Prof. Runge maintains an educational website for which international experts in MRI provide their insights on imaging techniques and strategies. Prof. Runge has developed a reputation within the radiology community for fostering diversity and establishing international collaboration. To date, Prof. Runge has worked with scholars from Asia , South America , and throughout Europe. In 2011, Prof. Runge received the Harry Fisher Medal for Excellence in Contrast Media Research from the Contrast Media Research Society . The recipient of this award is chosen from the field of academic and industry scientists by a panel of peers as the most significant contributor to the advance of contrast media research, and is given in recognition of overall contribution to science related to contrast media. Other academic honors include the Executive Council Award from the American Roentgen Ray Society (for research in MR and multiple sclerosis), the Dyke Memorial Awardfrom the American Society of Neuroradiology (for MR contrast media research), and aMagna Cum Laude Award (for the best scientific exhibit) from the Radiological Society of North America. He is a diplomat of the American Board of Radiology (1986) and is listed inthe 2009-2013 editions of Whoâ€™s Who in America. Prof. Runge has two daughters and currently resides in Galveston, Texas.
