 Embarrassing Bodies (formerly Embarrassing Illnesses) is a British television programme broadcast by Channel 4 and made by Maverick Television since 2007. In 2011, an hour long live show was introduced, "Embarrassing Bodies: Live from the Clinic", which makes use of Skype technology. Various spin-offs have been produced in relation to the programme to target different patients, such as Embarrassing Fat Bodies and Embarrassing Teenage Bodies. The show has a strong multiplatform presence on web and mobile. The main objective of the programme is to aid people who have a wide range of ailments that they are "too embarrassed" to show to their doctor. The programme can also help viewers self-diagnose at home without attending a doctor's appointment. As well as showing patients' visits to the doctor, the possible effects of certain people's occupations, such as cyclists or football players, are also shown. The programme's success has attracted large numbers of people to its website. Channel 4 has already worked with Kew Gardens on a database for natural plant remedies and medicines, and that was an online element of the Medicine Men series. The database invites contributions to the public and will eventually be turned over to Kew as a national, public resource. The programme is narrated by Ashley Jensen. Actor Nick Thomas-Webster and Big Brother 8 contestant Shabnam Paryani featured as patients in the first series. Series 1 was named Embarrassing Illnesses, Series 2 was named Embarrassing Teenage Bodies, Series 3, 4 and 5 were named Embarrassing Bodies, and a one-off episode, "Embarrassing Old Bodies", was broadcast in January 2010. A new series, Embarrassing Bodies: Kids, was shown in April 2010. The sixth series of Embarrassing Bodies started on 28 January 2011. In an interview with Digital Spy, Dawn Harper explained that the programme will save a large number of lives and will definitely encourage people to see their GP more often. Season 1 EB has won two Bafta awards: EB was nominated for the 2013 National Television Award for Factual Entertainment. In May 2011, a spin-off series, Embarrassing Bodies: Live From The Clinic (titled "Diagnosis Live From The Clinic" in pre-publicity and the first episode) launched, enabling viewers to appear via webcams and Skype.
