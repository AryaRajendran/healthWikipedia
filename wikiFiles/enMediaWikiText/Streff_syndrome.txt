 Streff syndrome is a vision condition primarily exhibited by children under periods of visual or emotional stress. Frequently patients will have reduced stereopsis, large accommodative lag on dynamic retinoscopy, and a reduced visual field (tubular or spiral field). Streff Syndrome was first described in 1962 by an optometrist, Dr. John Streff as Non-malingering syndrome. In 1962, Dr. Streff and Dr. Richard Apell expanded the concept to add early adaptive syndrome as a precursor to Streff syndrome. Dr. Streff believed the visual changes were induced by stress from reading. There is dispute on the taxonomy of functional vision defects. Some research indicates that Streff syndrome may be caused by a dysfunction in the magnocellular pathway of the retinal ganglion cells. These cells are only 10% of the retinal nerve cells and register motion detection. Early Adaptive Syndrome Most optometrists agree that Streff syndrome is a generalized reduction in visual performance that is not caused by disease. The poor visual performance is strictly psychological, and treatments are usually to provide the patient with low powered reading glasses. The "relaxing" nature of reading glasses is believed to, over time, teach the stressed visual system to "calm down, relax", and visual performance usually returns to normal. Patients may also benefit from appropriate psychological therapy or medications.
