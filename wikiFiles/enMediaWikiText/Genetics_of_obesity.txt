 Like many other medical conditions, obesity is the result of an interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Polymorphisms in various genes controlling appetite and metabolism predispose to obesity under certain dietary conditions. The percentage of obesity that can be attributed to genetics varies widely, depending on the population examined, from 6% to 85%. As of 2006, more than 41 sites on the human genome have been linked to the development of obesity when a favorable environment is present. Although genetic deficiencies are currently considered rare, variations in these genes may predispose to common obesity. Many candidate genes are highly expressed in the central nervous system. Several additional loci have been identified. Also, several quantitative trait loci for BMI have been identified. Confirmed and hypothesized associations include: Condition OMIM Locus Notes leptin deficiency 7q31.3 leptin receptor deficiency 1p31 prohormone convertase-1 deficiency 5q15-q21 proopiomelanocortin deficiency 2p23.3 melanocortin-4 receptor polymorphism (MC4R) 18q22 7q32.3 near D7S1804 13q14 near D13S257 6q23-q25 near D6S1009, GATA184A08, D6S2436, and D6S305 11q24 near D11S1998, D11S4464, and D11S912 16p13 near ATA41E04 20pter-p11.2 near D20S482 INSIG2 2q14.1 FTO 16q12.2 Adults who were homozygous for a particular FTO allele weighed about 3 kilograms more and had a 1.6-fold greater rate of obesity than those who had not inherited this trait. This association disappeared, though, when those with FTO polymorphisms participated in moderately intensive physical activity equivalent to three to four hours of brisk walking. TMEM18 2p25.3 GNPDA2 4p13 NEGR1 1p31.1 BDNF 11p13 KCTD15 19q13.12 SH2B1 16p11.2 MTCH2 11p11.2 PCSK1 5q15-q21 NPC1 18q11-q12 Some studies have focused upon inheritance patterns without focusing upon specific genes. One study found that 80% of the offspring of two obese parents were obese, in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight. The thrifty gene hypothesis postulates that due to dietary scarcity during human evolution people are prone to obesity. Their ability to take advantage of rare periods of abundance by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability, and individuals with greater adipose reserves would be more likely survive famine. This tendency to store fat, however, would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies. This is the presumed reason that Pima Indians, who evolved in a desert ecosystem, developed some of the highest rates of obesity when exposed to a Western lifestyle. Numerous studies of laboratory rodents provide strong evidence that genetics plays an important role in obesity. Obesity is also a major feature in several syndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Cohen syndrome, Ayazi syndrome, and MOMO syndrome. (The term "non-syndromic obesity" is sometimes used to exclude these conditions.) In people with early-onset severe obesity (defined by an onset before 10Â years of age and body mass index over three standard deviations above normal), 7% harbor a single locus mutation. Related:
