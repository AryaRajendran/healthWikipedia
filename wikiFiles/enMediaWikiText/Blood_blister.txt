 A blood blister is a type of blister that forms when subdermal tissues and blood vessels are damaged without piercing the skin. It consists of a pool of lymph, blood and other body fluids trapped beneath the skin. If punctured, it suppurates a dark fluid. Sometimes the fluids are cut off from the rest of the body and dry up, leaving behind dead cell material inside the blister with a texture like putty. Some blood blisters can be extremely painful due to bruising where the blister occurred. There are also blood blister-like aneurysms as these are known to be located in the supraclinoid internal carotid artery and "have been recognized as having unique pathological and clinical features. Common areas that suffer from blood blisters include the hands and feet. When the cause is abrasion, moleskin can be used to prevent blood blisters from forming. Blood blisters are commonly caused by accidents in which the skin is pinched by a tool, mechanism, or heavy weight without protective gear. Blood blisters can also arise from forcible human contact, including grappling. Blood blisters also may occur with constant rubbing back and forth. Because of this, baseball pitchers often contract blood blisters on the fingers. They also form as a result of frostbite. There are several methods of healing blood blisters, including elevation of the wound, application of a cold pack, and application of padded dressings or splints. "Blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs) are among the most hazardous cerebrovascular aneurysms to treat; microsurgical treatment of these small, wide-necked, and exceptionally fragile aneurysms place patients at significant risk of morbidity or mortality"
