 Elyn R. Saks is Associate Dean and Orrin B. Evans Professor of Law, Psychology, and Psychiatry and the Behavioral Sciences at the University of Southern California Gould Law School and an expert in mental health law. Saks suffers from schizophrenia and has written about her experience with the illness in her autobiography, The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness published by Hyperion Books, 2007. Dr. Saks is in training as a psychoanalyst in Southern California. Saks says "there's a tremendous need to implode the myths of mental illness, to put a face on it, to show people that a diagnosis does not have to lead to a painful and oblique life." In recent years, researchers have begun talking about mental health care in the same way addiction specialists speak of recovery — the lifelong journey of self-treatment and discipline that guides substance abuse programs. The idea remains controversial: managing a severe mental illness is more complicated than simply avoiding certain behaviors. Approaches include "medication (usually), therapy (often), a measure of good luck (always) — and, most of all, the inner strength to manage one's demons, if not banish them." That strength can come from any number of places, these former patients say: love, forgiveness, faith in God, a lifelong friendship. Saks says "we who struggle with these disorders can lead full, happy, productive lives, if we have the right resources." In June 2012, Saks gave a TED talk advocating for compassion toward people with mental illness. Saks has been researching high-functioning people with schizophrenia in Los Angeles, who suffer from "mild delusions or hallucinatory behavior". They are successful technicians, and medical, legal and business professionals. Many are studying toward college or graduate degrees. {{Persondata | NAME = Saks, Elyn | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American legal scholar | DATE OF BIRTH =| PLACE OF BIRTH =| DATE OF DEATH =| PLACE OF DEATH =}}
