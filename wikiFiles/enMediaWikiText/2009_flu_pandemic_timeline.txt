 This article covers the chronology of the 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. Flag icons denote the first announcements of confirmed cases by the respective nation-states, their first deaths (and other major events such as their first intergenerational cases, cases of zoonosis, and the start of national vaccination campaigns), and relevant sessions and announcements of the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union (and its agency the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control),and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Unless otherwise noted, references to terms like S-OIV, H1N1 and such, all refer to this new A(H1N1) strain and not to sundry other strains of H1N1 which are endemic in humans, birds and pigs. Take note that the date of the first confirmations of the disease or any event in a country may be before or after the date of the events in local time because of the International Dateline. MexicoIn La Gloria, Veracruz 60% of the town's population is sickened by a respiratory illness of unknown provenance. The government of Mexico believes it to be caused by h3n2 influenza, though at least one patient in La Gloria tested positive for A/H1N1. Two babies died in the outbreak but both were buried without testing. United States In the ninth week of its routine influenza surveillance, the CDC reports on FluView that thirty-five states have reported widespread influenza activity, and 14 states have reported regional activity, but that although the rate of activity was high, that the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I;) was below the epidemic threshold. United States The CDC reports on the 10th week of FluView that thirty states reported widespread influenza activity and 18 states reported regional activity. MexicoEarliest known onset of a case that is later to be confirmed as Swine-Origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection. United States CDC FluView, Week 11: Widespread influenza activity in twenty-four states; regional activity in 19. Influenza activity continues to decrease. United StatesEarliest known onset of a USA case later confirmed as swine flu, that of a nine-year-old girl residing in Imperial County, California. Thirteen states reported widespread influenza activity and 19 reported regional activity on the CDC's FluView, Week 12. United StatesA sample is collected from a nine-year-old female patient which is later confirmed to contain the novel virus strain (genetically sequenced as A/California/05/2009(H1N1)). United StatesOnset of illness for a ten-year-old boy residing in San Diego County, California; his case is eventually the first to be confirmed as swine flu in the USA . United StatesA nasopharyngeal swab is collected from a ten-year-old male patient in San Diego County, later confirmed as containing the novel virus and the first organism of that strain to be completely sequenced (A/California/04/2009(H1N1)). MexicoIn La Gloria, Veracruz, a four-year-old boy falls ill at the end of the outbreak. Only his sample, which was eventually sent abroad, tested positive for A(H1N1). Veracruz officials state that there were no plans to exhume the bodies of two infants who died in the outbreak. United States CDC FluView, Week 13: Widespread influenza activity in four states, regional activity in 18. European UnionThe media monitoring website MedISys reports on a Mexican article about the epidemiological alert. MexicoPublic health authorities begin investigating unusual cases of pneumonia. 400 people had reportedly sought treatment for pneumonia/influenza-like illness (ILI) in La Gloria the preceding week. United StatesBiosurveillance firm Veratect reports the unusual respiratory illness in Mexico. Veratect publishes the alert "La Gloria: 'Strange' Respiratory Affects 60% of Local Population; Three Pediatric Deaths May be Associated with the Outbreak." United States CDC FluView, Week 14: Widespread influenza activity in one state; regional activity in 14. MexicoThe General Directorate of Epidemiology (DGE) reports the outbreak of an ILI in a small community in Veracruz to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which is the Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO). Furthermore, a 39-year-old woman dies of severe viral pneumonia in the city of San Luis Potosí; this is later believed to be the earliest known fatality related to the outbreak. MexicoFirst death in Oaxaca due to what would later be identified as swine flu. United StatesThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is advised of a ten-year-old boy with a respiratory illness in San Diego County, California. Test results revealed an Influenza A virus but were negative for standard human strains. The San Diego County Health Department is notified. United StatesThe CDC receives its first sample from California (from the ten-year-old boy in San Diego County), and identifies the virus as a strain of swine influenza A(H1N1). MexicoAuthorities notify the PAHO of the atypical pneumonia. United StatesVeratect publishes the alert "Atypical Pneumonia Cases Reported at Hospital" regarding the Oaxaca cases. MexicoA case of atypical pneumonia in Oaxaca prompts enhanced national surveillance. A field investigation is started.Mexico contacts Canada to request more specialized testing. United StatesThe CDC receives a second sample from Southern California (taken from the nine-year-old girl in Imperial County), and again identifies the virus as a strain of swine influenza A(H1N1). The California Department of Public Health is notified. MexicoMexico sends 14 mucus samples to the CDC and dispatches health teams hospitals to look for patients showing severe influenza- or pneumonia-like symptoms. United States CDC FluView, Week 15: "Nine states reported regional activity; 17 states reported local influenza activity; the District of Columbia and 22 states reported sporadic influenza activity; and two states reported no influenza activity. Seven human infections with swine influenza A (H1N1) virus have been confirmed." This is the first mention of A(H1N1) in FluView. United StatesVeratect advises the CDC of the Mexican events.The CDC is already investigating the California and Texas cases. United StatesThe CDC alerts physicians to a similar novel strain of swine influenza A(H1N1) in two cases from Southern California in an Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Early Release on its website. Local investigations, including investigations in Texas, are already underway, and overall surveillance is enhanced. The Associated Press covers the alert, the first mention of the A(H1N1) outbreak in English-language news media. CanadaCanada receives the samples from Mexico for testing. MexicoThe Public Health Agency of Canada confirms Mexico cases of swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) infection.Genetic sequence analysis reveals that the Mexican patients were infected with the same S-OIV strain detected in two California children.The PAHO is informed that a cluster in Mexico of severe respiratory illnesses has been laboratory-confirmed as S-OIV infection. The WHO issues its first Disease Outbreak Notice on the matter, confirming the infection of a number of people in Mexico and the United States by "Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses… not… previously detected in pigs or humans." MexicoThe Minister of Health confirms the Mexican cases of human infection by swine influenza and states that it believes that some of these cases had resulted in death.Health authorities implement public health measures for all airport passengers and the vaccination of health care workers with seasonal influenza vaccine. United StatesThe CDC tells a press conference that seven of the 14 Mexican samples contained the same virus strain as the known in California and Texas, and that indications suggested that containment in the USA was "not very likely".The novel strain had already been reported on the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report website. WHO Under the International Health Regulations (IHR), the newly convened Emergency Committee meets for the first time, resulting in the WHO Director-General declaring a formal "public health emergency of international concern". The PAHO Vaccination Week In The Americas starts.The 2009 Week was planned to emphasize the vaccination of entire families, and health worker immunization.

The CDC also notes that almost all isolates of H1N1 remain sensitive to oseltamivir.<ref name="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly" /> "The proportion of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) was 2.3% which is at the national baseline of 2.3%." US First case of canine zoonosis confirmed. The 13-year-old dog from New York state was believed to have contracted the virus from his owner. US H1N1 is discovered at two North Carolina pig farms, making it the 10th state to identify the virus in animals. The swine caught the disease from infected workers and recovered after becoming moderately ill. Argentina An Argentine study published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that "Pediatric 2009 H1N1 influenza was associated with pediatric death rates that were 10 times the rates for seasonal influenza than in previous years," and that the elevated risk for pregnant women extends for as long as two weeks after they give birth. US CDC FluView Week 51: Influenza activity decreases slightly, although the proportion of deaths attributed to P&I; remained above the epidemic threshold. "Four states reported geographically widespread influenza activity, 13 states reported regional influenza activity, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 19 states reported local influenza activity, Guam and 13 states reported sporadic influenza activity, and one state reported no influenza activity, the U.S. Virgin Islands did not report." WHO At least 12,220 deaths globally are formally confirmed. (By contrast, the WHO estimates that the seasonal flu kills from 250,000 to 300,000 people around the world each year.) Overall, the activity of the H1N1 pandemic has peaked. Nepal First death confirmed, that of a woman who suffered major organ failure. WHO In Geneva Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of the WHO, remarks in the context of the H5N1 bird flu virus that "The fact that the long overdue influenza pandemic is so moderate in its impact is probably the best health news of the decade" but that "No, the world is not ready for a pandemic to be caused by H5N1." Given that H1N1 could still mutate, however, the WHO shall continue to monitor the pandemic for six months to a year. She also said that it would take at least two years before a true death total is established. (Approximately 11,500 people are believed to have died in more than 200 countries.) A study published in the NEJM finds that "household contacts less than 18 years of age were twice as susceptible to an acute respiratory illness as were those 19 to 50 years of age, whereas contacts older than 50 years were less susceptible." A joint US-UK study shows that children are twice as likely as adults to catch H1N1. United States CDC FluView Week 52: The proportion of deaths attributed to P&I; falls below the epidemic threshold. No influenza activity is reported in Nebraska. "One state reported geographically widespread influenza activity, 12 states reported regional influenza activity, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and 17 states reported local influenza activity, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, 19 states reported sporadic influenza activity, and one state reported no influenza activity."

Mauritania First case confirmed. United States The weekly report released by the CDC states that H1N1 activity has either remained stable or decreased over the past week in nine out of the ten regions of the United States. Furthermore, the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza, which technically remains above the epidemic threshold, has declined over the past week. Senegal First case confirmed United States According to the CDC, only three states have reported regional influenza activity: Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Niger First case confirmed<ref name="afro.who.int" /> United States According to the CDC, only four states have reported regional influenza activity: Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.

United States According to the CDC, only three states have reported regional influenza activity: Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. United States According to the CDC, only three states have reported regional influenza activity: Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Cuba Mass vaccination begins. United States The CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report states that inoculation rates varied, with the highest rates in New England and the lowest in the South. (E.g., roughly 39% of the population of Rhode Island is immunized vis-à-vis 13% that of Mississippi.) Among children Georgia had the lowest vaccination rate, with 21%; the state currently has the highest level of H1N1 flu activity. US According to the CDC, only three states have reported regional influenza activity: Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Cambodia Mass vaccinations begin. US According to the CDC, only three states have reported regional influenza activity: Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Guinea First case confirmed. WHO An external panel advises against winding down the pandemic alert level until experts have tracked the southern hemisphere's traditional autumn and winter flu season. Accusations of undue influence from the pharmaceutical industry were also addressed. US According to the CDC, no states have reported either widespread or regional influenza activity, and four have reported local activity: Hawaii, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan states that "It is still premature and too early for us to say we have come to an end of the pandemic influenza worldwide. It would be prudent and appropriate... to continue to monitor the evolution of this pandemic for the next six to 12 months," i.e. possibly into 2011. She also remarked that although the United States, Britain and Canada have passed through a second wave of H1N1, outbreaks in India, Egypt and elsewhere are intensifying, and reiterates that countries remain ill-prepared for a bird flu (H5N1) pandemic. More than 200 countries have now been affected by H1N1 with almost 12,000 confirmed deaths worldwide, although the vast majority of those infected recovered without special treatment. Philippines Mass vaccinations begin. US Only one state -Hawaii- reports local flu activity, and 28 states report no flu activity. WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan states at the U.N.'s World Health Assembly that "We are just plain lucky ... This has been the case with the A/ H1N1 influenza pandemic... The virus did not mutate to a more lethal form. Cases of resistance to oseltamivir remained few and isolated. The vaccine closely matched circulating viruses and showed an excellent safety record," Chan said. "Emergency wards and intensive care units were often strained, few health systems were overwhelmed ... Schools closed, but borders remained open, and disruptions to travel and trade were far less severe than feared," she told delegates from the agency's 193 member states. "Had things gone wrong in any of these areas, we would have a very different agenda before us today," she added." US Researchers discover the mutation which had enabled the pandemic. WHO Margaret Chan officially declares the H1N1 pandemic over as countries are now seeing a mix of H1N1, H3N2, and B viruses, with some populaces displaying community-level immunity to H1N1 of 20% to 40%. Nevertheless WHO urged health officials worldwide to prepare for the possibility that a new strain of flu will emerge in the near future. "Pandemics are unpredictable and prone to deliver surprises," Dr. Chan noted.
