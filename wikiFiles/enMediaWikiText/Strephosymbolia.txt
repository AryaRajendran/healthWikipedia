 Strephosymbolia was first coined in 1925 by Samuel Orton as being an answer to the implications the term word blindness makes. and help Specifically this new word was created to make a distinction between itself and word-blindness, but no reasons are given for what these distinctions arise from, or what exactly strephosymbolia means other than “a descriptive name for the whole group of children who show unusual difficulty in learning to read.” This definition was subsequently changed in 1937 to specify that as a condition, it creates difficulty in seeing the ends of written words in unfamiliar languages, especially those in which the letters look similar to each other such as b-d, m-n, and p-q.
