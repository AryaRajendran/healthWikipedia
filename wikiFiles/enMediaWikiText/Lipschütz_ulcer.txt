 Lipschütz ulcer or ulcus vulvae acutum () is a rare disease characterized by painful genital ulcers, fever, and lymphadenopathy, occurring most commonly in adolescents and young women (particularly virgins). It is not a sexually transmitted disease, and is often misdiagnosed, sometimes as a symptom of Behçet's disease. Lipschütz ulcer is named after Benjamin Lipschütz, who first described it in 1912. The etiology is still unknown, although it has been associated with several infectious causes, including paratyphoid fever, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus infection. The most common presentation is a single large, deep ulcer (although several smaller ulcers may occur) in the internal surface of one or both labia minora. The labia majora may be affected, as may the vagina and urethra. The ulcer develops very quickly, and is usually preceded by sudden onset of fever and malaise. Treatment is symptomatic, and usually of little value; in most cases, the ulcer heals spontaneously within four to six weeks, leaving scars. Topical analgesics and anesthetics, as well as topical application of disinfectants/astringents such as potassium permanganate (in sitz baths), is commonly used. In severe cases, a combination of systemic glucocorticoids and broad-spectrum antibiotics has been recommended. The disease was first described in October 1912 by Galician-born Austrian dermatologist and microbiologist Benjamin Lipschütz, who published a series of four cases in girls aged 14 to 17. He initially ascribed the ulcer to infection with "Bacillus crassus" (Lactobacillus acidophilus).
