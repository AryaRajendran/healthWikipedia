 This page lists the reported and registered HIV/AIDS cases by reporting region. This may be a country or subdivision, for some large nations national statistics are complicated and rare. This list is only documented cases, not for estimated cases. Estimated cases can vary wildly by source and year, and often are significantly higher than reported cases. In nations where reporting is poor, much of the population may go untested, and much of the reported deaths may be improperly attributed to opportunistic infections rather than AIDS, therefore, higher statistics here do not indicate one region is harder hit by HIV/AIDS than another, rather the government acknowledgement and action to document cases of an epidemic. Some of the hardest hit nations, especially in Africa and Asia, have very poor reporting, and thus low or no statistics here. US CDC has begun reporting AIDS related deaths but HIV cases is not uniform among states. Reporting of cases and deaths may be delayed by years in many nations, masking epidemics. According to World AIDS Day 2011 estimates, some 30 million have died, 64 million have been infected since the epidemic began. COLOR CODE: Countries/regions in light blue have latest year HIV cases exceeding 10% of cumulative total, deep blue exceeding 20%, and pink exceeding 30%. These colors suggest an outbreak or insufficient reporting. If HIV estimates are correct, government efforts to report are still hugely inadequate, only 1 in 4 hiv cases have ever been reported globally, and 1 in 13 deaths.(using this list as reference) Country/Region Documented Cases HIV(Cumulative) Documented Deaths(Cumulative) HIV cases past 12 mo. before reported date Figures as of** World (sum of all regions) 16,545,209* 2,348,393* 3,383,500 of which 3,140,000 eligible ARV (2010) plus 2010 deaths , 1,400,000 enrolled ART 282,578 (2010 only) 2,021,181 of which 359,181 enrolled ARV(2010), 1,662,000 on ART waiting list - 1,529,031 (ever registered for ART) 80,956 ('08 to '11) 1,148,117 666,347 and dependent areas 1,132,836(2009, AIDS only) 601,415(2008) 947,000 of which 347,000 enrolled ARV, with 600,000 waiting (2012) N/A || 60,000 (jan-oct 2010) || dec 2012 742,575 125,557 608,230* (AIDS only) 241,469 (Dec 2010) (does not include Hong Kong SAR Macau SAR) 578,121 (492,121 living, Oct 2012) 86,000(2011) 569,056 (356,056 ART enrolled, 3/12, 213,000 planned for '13) || N/A || 128,980 (2010) || Dec 2010 540,000 on ARV N/A || N/A || Aug 2012 350,000 ART enrolled N/A || N/A || Dec 2012 260,100 53,800 254,471 2006-Dec 2009 241,236 ever on ART New York State, 245,304 116,651 218,023 27,547 California, 206,401 93,799 181,810 (148,130 AIDS+33,680 HIV) 5,121 114,766 19,912 107,122 on ART currently N/A || || 2010 Texas, 104,209 40,590 97,500+ N/A || N/A || Dec 2009 93,827 14,804 92,251 7,293 78,654 (AIDS only) 51,000 76,383 - New Jersey, 73,289 38,573 67,442 13,635 64,729 N/A || 4,250 || Dec 2008 Georgia, 48,637 16,860 43,199*** N/A || 3,952 || Dec 2010 40,144 N/A || 2,918 || Dec 2010 37,315 (on ARV) N/A || || 2009 38,678 6,767 37,537 N/A || || Dec 2007 32,087 N/A || N/A || Dec 2009 Virginia, 30,434 9,779 30,153 N/A || 765 || Dec 2007 29,330 N/A || 1,200 || Mar 2011 28,851 N/A || 894 || Dec 2007 27,000 N/A || 1052 (7 mo) || Jul 2011 26,978 N/A || 10,846 || Dec 2011 21,138 on ART N/A || 5,179 (2007) || Dec 2009 21,810 N/A || 4,041 || Dec 2009 N/A || 18,082 (2008 only) || 22,541 || Dec 2008 24,539 N/A || 3267 (10 mo) || Oct 2012<ref name="unodp">UNODP:Central Asia Fact Sheet 23,406 N/A || 1196 || Dec 2010 23,081 2,443 (8-09) 19,435 N/A || "nearly 100%" || Dec 2008 20,667 1,584 18,348 N/A || N/A || Jun 2010 17,266 N/A || 1,969 (2010) || Feb 2011 N/A || 18,082 (2008 only) || 22,541 || Dec 2008 16,334 District of Columbia, 15,120 N/A || 2,682 (24 mo) || Dec 2008 18,599 N/A || 995 || Dec 2010 16,000 N/A || 992 || Dec 2012 14,438 N/A || 2,884 || Dec 2010 12,221 353 12,315(dec 2011) 67(sep 09) 11,994 2,063 11,547 4,000+ 11,204 917 10,996 1,767 10,452 N/A || 513 (10 mo) || Oct 2010 10,436 (Oct 2010) 938 Apr 2008 Papua, 9,447 382 8,935 N/A || 486 || Dec 2010<ref name="Barents">BarentsObserver:HIV on the rise in Murmansk 8,377 N/A || 315 || 2012 end 7,756 960 7,656 1364 Phuket, 6,648 (citizens only) 1,767 Volta Region, 6,289* N/A || 3,309(10 mo) || Oct 2009 5,872 N/A || 275 || Dec 2011 5,783 N/A || 513 || dec 2012 5,599 441 Dec 2008 5,319 N/A || N/A || Sep 2010 5,224 N/A || 912 || Dec 2011 5,306 1,493 Zaire Province, 5,094 N/A || 150 (3 mo) || Mar 2009 4,888 N/A || 274 || Dec 2010 4,842 1250 on ART (2009) 1038(2009) Cabinda, 4,813 N/A || 903(10 mo) || Oct 2009 4,700 731 (Apr 2013) 4,627 N/A || 258 || Dec 2010 3,873 N/A || N/A || Dec 2010 3,667 N/A || 493 || Dec 2012 Brong-Ahafo Region, Ghana N/A || N/A || 3,746 || Dec 2008 3,735 (living) N/A || N/A || Dec 2008 3,071 - Northern Region (Ghana), 3,100+ N/A || 900 (6 mo) || Jun 2009 2,909 387 DKI Jakarta, 2,828 761 2,554 1071 Niger State, N/A || N/A || 2304 || Dec 2009 2533 325 2060 living N/A || 160 || Dec 2012 Santa Cruz Department, 1,959 N/A || N/A || Jul 2008 Netherlands Antilles 1,812 N/A || 90 || Dec 2007 1,655 N/A || 35(3 mo) || Mar 2009 1,675 178 1,463 180 1,231 N/A || 90 || Jun 2008 1,272 N/A || 163 || Dec 2010 Maluku, 962 N/A || N/A || Dec 2009 [ || 712 || 90 || 69 || Dec 2009 636 147 (10 mo) 556 N/A || N/A || Dec 2008 482 N/A || 62 || Dec 2012 Macau, 427 N/A || 21(Dec 07) || Dec 2007/Dec 09 231 N/A || N/A || Dec 2008 217 43 117 N/A || N/A || Apr 2009 61 8 56 N/A || 11 || Dec 2009
