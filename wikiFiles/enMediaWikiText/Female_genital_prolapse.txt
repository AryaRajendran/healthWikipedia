 Female genital prolapse (or vaginal prolapse) is characterized by a portion of the vaginal canal protruding (prolapsing) from the opening of the vagina. The condition usually occurs when the pelvic floor collapses as a result of childbirth. They are graded either via the Baden-Walker System or the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) System. Baden-Walker System for the Evaluation of Pelvic Organ Prolapse on Physical Examination Grade !! posterior urethral descent, lowest part other sites 0 normal position for each respective site 1 descent halfway to the hymen 2 descent to the hymen 3 descent halfway past the hymen 4 maximum possible descent for each site Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System (POP-Q) Stage !! description 0 No prolapse anterior and posterior points are all -3 cm, and C or D is between -TVL and -(TVL-2) cm. 1 The criteria for stage 0 are not met, and the most distal prolapse is more than 1 cm above the level of the hymen (less than -1 cm). 2 The most distal prolapse if between 1 cm above and 1 cm below the hymen (at least one point is -1, 0, or +1). 3 The most distal prolapse is more than 1 cm below the hymen but no further than 2 cm less than TVL. 4 Represents complete procidentia or vault eversion Vaginal prolapses are treated according to the severity of symptoms. They can be treated: Genital prolapse occurs in about 316Â million women worldwide as of 2010 (9.3% of all females).
