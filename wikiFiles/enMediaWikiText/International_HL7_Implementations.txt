 International HL7 implementations is a collection of known implementations of the HL7 Interoperability standard. These do not necessarily refer to cross-border health information systems. HL7 Australia is the local affiliate of the international HL7 organisation and is an open, volunteer-based, not-for-profit organisation that supports the needs of HL7 users in Australia. It is the accredited national affiliate of HL7.org and has local responsibility for a range of core activities including the distribution and licensing of HL7 standards materials, education and participation in international HL7 standards development.

The HL7 New Zealand website outlines the following commitments. The user group shall be established on the following basic principles: Functions of HL7 New Zealand Prince Edward Island, a province within Canada is the only instance of a province-wide attempt at implementing the HL7 interoperability standard. It has been standards compliant with the following characteristics of HL7: The main user of HL7 in Mexico is the Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS). IMSS have been developing V3 messaging for three years and currently have 19 active messages across 9 domains with a further 24 messages currently in development. They are using a modified version of Veteran’s VISTA in combination with middleware which transforms from VISTA’s native V2 messages to V3 and vice versa.There is also a joint project in progress to develop an HL7 Gateway with Microsoft. It is envisaged that this project will enable systems to exchange HL7 messages with IMSS without concerning themselves with HL7 translation.HL7 Mexico has also been working to make government agencies such as the Ministry of Health aware of the importance of HL7 in exchanging healthcare information.As well as improving external links, HL7 Mexico has also been working to improve its internal processes and encourage new membership across the board. The HL7 standards development organisation is based in America and oversees the development of the HL7 standard. HL7 current work programme includes: China has so far tested HL7 messaging standards in order to ensure interoperability. In the Guangdong province, government has gone as far as to mandate that developers of health information systems utilize the HL7 standard to transfer patient clinical information. The Chinese Hospital Management Association (CHIMA) manages the role of the Basic Data Set Standards project, of which its working groups have accomplished 1976 data items, some of which reference the HL7 standard. HL7 India is an independent, non-profit-distributing, membership based organization that exists to encourage the adoption of standards for healthcare information communication within India. The objective of HL7 India is to support the development, promotion and implementation of HL7 standards and specifications in a way which addresses the concerns of healthcare organizations, health professionals and healthcare software suppliers in India.

Purpose of the HL7 Sweden In Turkey, the HL7 affiliate operates as an autonomous subgroup of the Turkish Medical Informatics Association (TURKMIA). Affiliate members are admitted once they have passed certain prerequisite studies. HL7 Turkey has been focusing a good deal of effort in the past year on raising the country’s awareness of HL7, with the result that HL7 is (unofficially) the standard for Turkish healthcare informatics projects.HL7 Turkey has worked closely with the Turkish Ministry of Health IT Department in order to insure that the following areas would benefit from the HL7 standard: HL7 UK is the UK affiliate organisation to HL7, and was set up in January 2000. The mission of HL7 UK is entirely complementary with that of the parent HL7 organisation: HL7 UK sets out to: HL7 UK seeks to identify HL7 standards that are applicable to UK healthcare without change and those that require adaptations or national implementation guidelines to meet UK requirements. Where UK adaptations, profiles or guidelines are required, HL7 UK proposes solutions that meet the need for consistent national implementation, while avoiding unnecessary divergence from HL7 standards. To this end, HL7 UK feeds back national requirements and proposed solutions to its parent body. HL7 version 2 is used by almost all Swiss hospitals.
