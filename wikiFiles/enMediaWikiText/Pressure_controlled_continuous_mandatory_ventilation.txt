 Pressure Controlled Continuous Mandatory Ventilation (PC-CMV) is any [[mode of mechanical ventilation]] with preset inspiratory pressure and inspiratory time. Every breath is mandatory (ie, patient or machine triggered and machine cycled). ==Pressure control== PCV â€” Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) also Pressure Control (PC) is a controlled mode of ventilation. The ventilator delivers a flow to maintain the preset pressure at a preset [[respiratory rate]] over a preset inspiratory time. The pressure is constant during the inspiratory time and the flow is decelerating. If for any reason pressure decreases during isnpiration, the flow from the ventilator will immediately increase to maintain the set inspiratory pressure. Pressure Controlled Continuous Mandatory Ventilation is any [[mode of mechanical ventilation]] with preset inspiratory pressure and inspiratory time. Every breath is mandatory (ie, patient or machine trigged and machine cycled). ==See also== *[[Modes of mechanical ventilation]] *[[Volume Controlled Continuous Mandatory Ventilation]] *[[Volume Controlled Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation]] *[[Pressure Controlled Continuous Mandatory Ventilation]] *[[Pressure Controlled Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation]] *[[Continuous Spontaneous Ventilation]] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Template:Mechanical ventilation}} [[Category:Respiratory therapy]] [[Category:Emergency medicine]] [[Category:Intensive care medicine]] [[Category:Emergency medical services]] [[Category:Respiratory system procedures]] [[Category:Mechanical ventilation]]
