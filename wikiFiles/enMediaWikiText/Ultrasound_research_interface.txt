 An ultrasound research interface (URI) is a software tool loaded onto a diagnostic clinical ultrasound device which provides functionality beyond typical clinical modes of operation. Before an ultrasound image can be displayed to the user, it must undergo a series of transformations, typically referred to as the ultrasound processing chain. As data moves through the processing chain, it may be desirable to acquire it at certain intervals, so it can be processed offline for research purposes. A set of processing parameters sent to the ultrasound device control how the processing chain performs its operations. It may also be desirable to change these processing parameters to achieve different imaging results. A clinical ultrasound user only has access to the ultrasound data in its final processed form, referred to as a B-Mode image. The format of the images are typically in the DICOM file format. The clinical user also has limited access to the processing parameters that can be modified; for reasons of device usability, and so the device cannot be put into a state that renders itself inoperable. The URI provides a means to step beyond the limits of the clinical usage, and allow researchers to acquire data from certain points in the processing chain, as well as change a larger set of processing parameters. A typical digital ultrasound processing chain for B-Mode imaging may look as follows: Multiple signals processed in this way are lined up together and interpolated and rasterized into readable image. A URI may provide data access at many different stages of the processing chain, these include: Where many diagnostic ultrasound devices have Doppler imaging modes for measuring blood flow, the URI may also provide access to Doppler related signal data, which can include: A URI may include many different tools for enabling the researcher to make better use of the device and the data captured, some of these tools include: Ultimedical Ultrasound RF data device
