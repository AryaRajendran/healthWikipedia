 Salpingitis isthmica nodosa, also known as diverticulosis of the Fallopian tube, is nodular thickening of the narrow part of the uterine tube, due to inflammation. It is abbreviated SIN. SIN is associated with infertility and ectopic pregnancy, and may present as either. It is characterized by nodular thickening of the tunica muscularis of the narrow (isthmic) portion of the Fallopian tube. In severe cases, it leads to complete obliteration of the tubal lumen. It is uncommonly bilateral. It is diagnosed with hysterosalpingography.
