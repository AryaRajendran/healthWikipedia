 Pigeon toe (also known as metatarsus varus, metatarsus adductus, in-toe gait, intoeing or false clubfoot) is a condition which causes the toes to point inward when walking. It is most common in infants and children under two years of age and, when not the result of simple muscle weakness, normally arises from one of three underlying conditions, a twisted shin bone, an excessive anteversion (femoral head is more than 15Â° from the angle of torsion) resulting in the twisting of the thigh bone when the front part of a person's foot is turned in. Severe cases are considered a form of clubfoot. Most of these conditions are self-correcting during childhood. In the worst cases surgery may be needed. Most of the time this involves lengthening the achilles tendon. Less severe treatment options for pigeon toe include keeping a child from crossing his or her legs, use of corrective shoes and casting of the foot and lower legs, which is normally done before the child reaches 12 months of age or older. If the pigeon toe is mild and close to the center, treatment may not be necessary. Ballet has been used as a treatment for mild cases. Dance exercises can help to bend the legs outward.
