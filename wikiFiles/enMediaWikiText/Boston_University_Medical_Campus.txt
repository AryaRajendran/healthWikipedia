 The Boston University Medical Campus (BUMC) is one of the two campuses of Boston University, the other being the Charles River Campus. The campus is situated in the South End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. In conjunction with the Charles River Campus, BUMC provides the Boston University Shuttle (BUS) to transport students, staff, and faculty between campuses. The current provost of BUMC is Karen H. Antman. The BUMC Public Safety Department employees about 90 public safety officers who are charged with ensuring the safety and security of all patients, staff, students, and visitors within and around the medical center grounds. Public Safety officers provide motorist assistance, lost and found, and night escort service for the campus. Although not a police department, many of the officers have arrest powers either as Boston special officers or sworn Massachusetts State special police officers. Officers on campus respond to high-stress and emergency situations on a daily basis and make frequent arrests of violators within and around the campus. The public safety department conducts investigations for violations of University and/or Hospital policies and procedures, and suspected criminal acts. This department is a separate entity than the Boston University Police Department.
