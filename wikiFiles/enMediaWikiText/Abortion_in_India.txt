 Abortion in India has been legal since 1971. The Indian Penal Code, which was enacted in 1860 and was written in accordance with British law at the time of is creation, declared induced abortion as illegal. Induced abortion was defined as purposely "causing miscarriage",. Abortion practitioners would either be incarcerated for up to three years, fined, or both; women undergoing abortions could be imprisoned for up to seven years and also be charged an additional fine. The only exception was when abortion was induced in order to save the life of the woman. Despite the fact that this passage in the penal code was changed in Great Britain in 1967, India did not change it until 1971. Countless women died attempting illegal abortions as a result of the penal code, and it was a combination of this and the growing population that made the country reconsider its initial stance. In 1964, the Central Family Planning Board of the Government of India met and formed a committee designed to examine the subject of abortion from medical, legal, social, and moral standpoints. The Abortion Study Committee, lead by the then Health Minister of the state of Maharashtra Mr. Shantilal Shah, spent the next two years studying the issue, and submitted a report with its suggestions in December 1966. This report considered the penal code to be too restrictive and recommended that the law's qualifications should be relaxed; many of these suggestions were included in the subsequent Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act. As per India’s abortion laws only qualified doctors under stipulated conditions can perform abortion on a woman in an approved clinic or hospital. The Indian abortion laws fall under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, which was enacted by the Indian Parliament in the year 1971. The MTP Act came into effect from April 1, 1972 and was once amended in 1975. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act of India clearly states the conditions under which a pregnancy can be ended or aborted, the persons who are qualified to conduct the abortion and the place of implementation. Some of these qualifications are as follows: The length of the pregnancy must not exceed twenty weeks in order to qualify for an abortion. At the time the Act was passed, people feared the overcrowding of hospitals and an increase in promiscuity in teenagers, young adults, and young widows. Sex-selective abortions favoring males was also a concern.

[Para 22 & 29]. According to the Consortium on National Consensus for Medical Abortion in India, every year an average of about 11 million abortions take place annually and around 20,000 women die every year due to abortion related complications. Most abortion-related maternal deaths are attributable to illegal abortions.In the following table Number of abortions reported includes legal reported induced abortions.

Any woman coming to a health facility seeking termination of pregnancy the following aspects have to be assessed and found appropriate: Abortion in India can be done till 20 weeks of pregnancy. But an opinion of a second doctor is necessary between weeks 12 and 20. Only registered medical practitioners as prescribed by the MTP Act are authorized to prescribe mifepristone with misoprostol for medical abortion (Definition 2(d) of section 2 and MTP rule 3).Mifepristone with misoprostol for termination of early pregnancy not exceeding seven weeks, may be prescribed by a registered medical practitioner as prescribed under section 2 (d) and rule 3, having access to a place approved by the Government under section 4 (b) and rule (1), for surgical and emergency back-up when such a back-up is indicated.This may include primary health care-clinic or hospital-based set-up.

These include the cases in which
