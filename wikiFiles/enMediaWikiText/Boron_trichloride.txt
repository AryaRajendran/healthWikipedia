 Boron trichloride is the inorganic compound with the formula BCl<sub>3</sub>. This colorless gas is a valuable reagent in organic synthesis. It is highly reactive toward water. Boron reacts with halogens to give the corresponding trihalides. Boron trichloride is, however, produced industrially by direct chlorination of boron oxide and carbon at 500 °C. The carbothermal synthesis is analogous to the Kroll process for the conversion of titanium dioxide to titanium tetrachloride. In the laboratory BF<sub>3</sub> reacted with AlCl<sub>3</sub> gives BCl<sub>3</sub> via halogen exchange. BCl<sub>3</sub> is a trigonal planar molecule like the other boron trihalides, and has a bond length of 175pm. A degree of π-bonding has been proposed to explain the short B− Cl distance although there is some debate as to its extent. It does not dimerize, although NMR studies of mixtures of boron trihalides shows the presence of mixed halides. The absence of dimerisation contrasts with the tendencies of AlCl<sub>3</sub> and GaCl<sub>3</sub>, which form dimers or polymers with 4 or 6 coordinate metal centres. BCl<sub>3</sub> hydrolyzes readily to give boric acid: Alcohols behave analogously giving the borate esters, e.g. trimethyl borate.As a strong Lewis acid, BCl<sub>3</sub> i forms adducts with tertiary amines, phosphines, ethers, thioethers, and halide ions. For example, BCl<sub>3</sub> · S(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (CAS# 5523-19-3) is often employed as a conveniently handled source of BCl<sub>3</sub> because this solid (m.p. 88-90 °C) releases BCl<sub>3</sub>: The mixed aryl and alkyl boron chlorides are also of known. Phenylboron dichloride is commercially available. Such species can be prepared by the redistribution reaction of BCl<sub>3</sub> with organotin reagents: Reduction of BCl<sub>3</sub> to elemental boron is conducted commercially (see below). In the laboratory, when boron trichloride can be converted to diboron tetrachloride but heating with copper metal: B<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> can also be prepared in this way. Colourless diboron tetrachloride (m.p. -93 °C) is a planar molecule in the solid, (similar to dinitrogen tetroxide, but in the gas phase the structure is staggered. It decomposes at room temperatures to give a series of monochlorides having the general formula (BCl)<sub>n</sub>, in which n may be 8, 9, 10, or 11. The compounds with formulas B<sub>8</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub> and B<sub>9</sub>Cl<sub>9</sub> are known to contain closed cages of boron atoms. Boron trichloride is a starting material for the production of elemental boron. It is also used in the refining of aluminium, magnesium, zinc, and copper alloys to remove nitrides, carbides, and oxides from molten metal. It has been used as a soldering flux for alloys of aluminium, iron, zinc, tungsten, and monel. Aluminum castings can be improved by treating the melt with boron trichloride vapors. In the manufacture of electrical resistors, a uniform and lasting adhesive carbon film can be put over a ceramic base using BCl<sub>3</sub>. It has been used in the field of high energy fuels and rocket propellants as a source of boron to raise BTU value. BCl<sub>3</sub> is also used in plasma etching in semiconductor manufacturing. This gas etches metal oxides by formation of a volatile BOCl<sub>x</sub> compounds. BCl<sub>3</sub> is used as a reagent in the synthesis of organic compounds. Like the corresponding bromide, it cleaves C-O bonds in ethers. BCl<sub>3</sub> is an aggressive reagent that can form hydrogen chloride upon exposure to moisture or alcohols. The dimethyl sulfide adduct BCl<sub>3</sub>SMe<sub>2</sub>), which is a solid, is much safer to use, when possible, but H<sub>2</sub>O will destroy the BCl<sub>3</sub> portion while leaving dimethyl sulfide in solution. <div class="references-small">
