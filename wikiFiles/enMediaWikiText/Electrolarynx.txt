 An electrolarynx, sometimes referred to as a "throat back", is a medical device about the size of a small electric razor used to produce clearer speech by those who have lost their original voicebox, usually due to cancer of the larynx. The most common device is a handheld, battery operated device placed under the mandible which produces vibrations and allow speech. Earlier non-electric devices were called mechanical larynxes. Along with developing esophageal voice, robotic voice or undergoing a surgical procedure, the electrolarynx serves as a mode of speech recovery for laryngectomy patients. Initially, the pneumatic mechanical larynx was developed in the 1920s by Western Electric, which did not run on electricity, and was flawed in that it produced a weak voice. Electrolarynxes were introduced in the 1940s, at a time when esophageal voice was being promoted as the best course in speech recovery; however, since that technique is difficult to master, the electrolarynx became quite popular. Since then, many medical procedures, such as the tracheo-oesophageal puncture, were created to enable speech without continued dependence on a handheld device. The use of an electrolarynx can cause some social issues including difficulty ordering a drink in a noisy pub, and, when answering a telephone, the caller responds "Is this a computer that I'm speaking to?"
