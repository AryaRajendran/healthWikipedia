 A gallop rhythm refers to a (usually abnormal) rhythm of the heart on auscultation. It includes three or four sounds, thus resembling the sounds of a gallop. The normal heart rhythm contains two audible heart sounds called S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> that give the well-known "lub-dub" rhythm; they are caused by the closing of valves in the heart. A gallop rhythm contains another sound, called S<sub>3</sub> or S<sub>4</sub>, dependent upon where in the cycle this added sound comes. It can also contain both of these sounds forming a quadruple gallop, and in situations of very fast heart rate can produce a summation gallop where S<sub>3</sub> and S<sub>4</sub> occur so close as to be indistinguishable. Gallop rhythms may be heard in young or athletic people, but may also be a sign of serious cardiac problems like heart failure as well as pulmonary edema.
