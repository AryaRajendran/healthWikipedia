 Usual, customary and reasonable (UCR) was an American method of generating health care prices, described as "more or less whatever doctors decided to charge." According to Steven Schroeder, Wilbur Cohen inserted UCR into the Social Security Act of 1965 "in an unsuccessful attempt to placate the American Medical Association." Under this system, physician services were largely considered to be misvalued, with evaluation and management services being undervalued and procedures overvalued. Third-party payers (public and private health insurance) advocated for an improved model instead of the UCR fees that led to "some egregious distortions". In the mid 1980s, U.S. health care "payments for doing procedures had far outstripped payments for diagnosis". For example, "doctors who spent an hour making a complex and lifesaving diagnosis were paid forty dollars; for spending an hour doing a colonoscopy and excising a polyp, they received more than six hundred dollars". Costs for cataract surgery, which could be as high as $6,000 in 1985, "grew to consume 4% of Medicare's budget". And despite technology that reduced the time required for the surgery by a factor of 4 to 6, costs did not decrease. The term is also used by lawyers for setting a reasonable retainer agreement.
