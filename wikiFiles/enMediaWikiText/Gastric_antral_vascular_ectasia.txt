 Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is an uncommon cause of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding or iron deficiency anemia. The condition is associated with dilated small blood vessels in the antrum, or the last part of the stomach. The dilated vessels result in intestinal bleeding. It is also called watermelon stomach because streaky long red areas that are present in the stomach may resemble the markings on watermelon. The condition was first discovered in 1952, and reported in the literature in 1953. Watermelon disease was first diagnosed by Wheeler et al. in 1979, and definitively described in four living patients by Jabbari et al. only in 1984. As of 2011, the etiology and pathogenesis are still not known. However, there are several competing hypotheses as to various etiologies. Most patients who are eventually diagnosed with watermelon stomach come to a physician complaining of anemia and blood loss. Sometimes, a patient may come to the medical doctor because he or she notices blood in the stools — either melena (black and tarry stools) and/or hematochezia (maroon stools). GAVE results in intestinal bleeding similar to duodenal ulcers and portal hypertension. The GI bleeding can result in anemia, as well as occult blood in the stool. It is often overlooked, but can be more common in elderly patients. It has been seen in patients as young as 38 years of age. Watermelon stomach has a different etiology and has a differential diagnosis from portal hypertension. In fact, cirrhosis and portal hypertension may be missing in a patient with GAVE. The differential diagnosis is important because treatments are different. .]]GAVE is usually diagnosed definitively by means of an endoscopic biopsy. The tell-tale watermelon stripes show up during the endoscopy. Surgical exploration of the abdomen may be needed to diagnose some cases, especially if the liver or other organs are involved. GAVE is characterized by dilated capillaries in the lamina propria with fibrin thrombi. The main histomorphologic differential diagnosis is portal hypertension, which is often apparent from clinical findings. Research in 2010 has shown that anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies may be used as a risk marker for GAVE in systemic sclerosis patients. The average age of diagnosis for GAVE is 73 years of age for females, and 68 for males. Women are about twice as often diagnosed with gastric antral vascular ectasia than men. 71% of all cases of GAVE are diagnosed in females. Patients in their thirties have been found to have GAVE.<ref name="Unusual" /> It becomes more common in women in their eighties, rising to 4% of all such gastrointestinal conditions.<ref name="ablation" /> 5.7% of all sclerosis patients (and 25% of those who had a certain anti-RNA marker) have GAVE.<ref name="risk" /> The literature, from 1953 through 2010, often cited that the etiology or pathogenesis of watermelon disease are unknown.<ref name="Chronic" /><ref name="Unusual" /><ref name="Argon" /> Gender has some relationship to the etiology. 65% of patients with both cirrhosis and GAVE are male, but a total of 30% have both conditions.<ref name="rare" /> The causal connection between cirrhosis and GAVE has not been proven.<ref name="Unusual" /> A connective tissue disease has been suspected in some cases.<ref name="Argon" /> Autoimmunity may have something to do with it, as 25% of all sclerosis patients who had a certain anti-RNA marker have GAVE.<ref name="risk" /> RNA autoimmunity has been suspected as a cause or marker since at least 1996.<ref name="RNA" /> One theory current since the 1990s focuses on a history of prolapse of the stomach into the small intestine.<ref name="rare" /><ref name="Chronic" /> Gastrin levels may indicate a hormonal connection.<ref name="Unusual" /> This may be due to a "vasoactive intestinal peptide and 5-hydroxy-tryptamine…".<ref name="rare" /> It is also possible that infection by H. pylori can cause it. GAVE is associated with a number of conditions, including portal hypertension, chronic renal failure, and collagen vascular diseases.<ref name="Antrectomy" /><ref name="ablation" /> Watermelon stomach also occurs particularly with scleroderma,<ref name="Antrectomy" /> and especially the subtype known as systemic sclerosis.<ref name="Antrectomy" /><ref name="risk" /> A full 5.7% of persons with sclerosis have GAVE, and 25% of all sclerosis patients who had a certain anti-RNA marker have GAVE.<ref name="risk" /> In fact: The endoscopic appearance of GAVE is similar to portal hypertensive gastropathy, but is not the same condition, and may be concurrent with cirrhosis of the liver.<ref name="Antrectomy" /><ref name="Unusual" /><ref name="Portal" /> 30% of all patients have cirrhosis associated with GAVE.<ref name="rare" /><ref name="Unusual" /> Sjögren's syndrome has been associated with at least one patient.

Treatments for GAVE have proliferated in recent years. GAVE is treated commonly by means of an endoscope, including argon plasma coagulation and electrocautery.<ref name="Unusual" /><ref name="Argon" /><ref name="relapse" /> Since endoscopy with argon photocoagulation is "usually effective", surgery is "usually not required."<ref name="Argon" /> Coagulation therapy is well-tolerated but "tends to induce oozing and bleeding."<ref name="Argon" /> "Endoscopy with thermal ablation" is favored medical treatment because of its low side effects and low mortality, but is "rarely curative."<ref name="Unusual" /> Other medical treatments have been tried and include estrogen and progesterone therapy,<ref name="relapse" /> and anti-fibrinolytic drugs such as tranexamic acid. Corticostreoids are effective, but are "limited by their side effects."<ref name="Argon" /> Cryotherapy ablation is another possibility, which has been used for esophageal cancer, and Barrett's esophagus. While used successfully for both esophageal dysplasia and neoplasia, it has not yet been reported for the treatment of GAVE. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved such cryotherapy only for esophagus cancer and Barrett's with dysplasia.<ref name="News" /> A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS or TIPSS) procedure is used to treat portal hypertension when that is present as an associated condition. Unfortunately, the TIPSS, which has been used for similar conditions, may cause or exacerbate hepatic encephalopathy. TIPSS-related encephalopathy occurs in about 30% of cases, with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of encephalopathy, higher age, female sex, and liver disease due to causes other than alcohol. The patient, with his or her physician and family, must balance out a reduction in bleeding caused by TIPS with the significant risk of encephalopathy.<ref name="Khan" /><ref name="Saab" /><ref name="Sundaram" /> Various shunts have been shown in a meta-study of 22 studies to be effective treatment to reduce bleeding, yet none have any demonstrated survival advantage.<ref name="Khan" /> If there is cirrhosis of the liver that has progressed to liver failure, then lactulose may be prescribed for hepatic encephalopathy, especially for Type C encephalopathy with diabetes.<ref name="Sundaram" /> Also, "antibiotics such as neomycin, metronidazole, and rifaximin" may be used effectively to treat the encephalopathy by removing nitrogen-producing bacteria from the gut.<ref name="Sundaram" /> Paracentesis, a medical procedure involving needle drainage of fluid from a body cavity, may be used to remove fluid from the peritoneal cavity in the abdomen for such cases.<ref name="Saab" /> This procedure uses a large needle, similar to the better-known amniocentesis. Surgery, consisting of excision of part of the lower stomach, also called antrectomy, is another option.<ref name="Unusual" /><ref name="cirrhotic" /> Antrectomy is "the resection, or surgical removal, of a part of the stomach known as the antrum." Laparoscopic surgery is possible in some cases, and as of 2003, was a "novel approach to treating watermelon stomach." A treatment used sometimes is endoscopic band ligation. In 2010, a team of Japanese surgeons performed a "novel endoscopic ablation of gastric antral vascular ectasia." The experimental procedure resulted in "no complications."<ref name="ablation" /> Relapse is possible, even after treatment by argon plasma coagulation and progesterone. In such cases of relapse, surgery may be the only option; in one case that involved "Endoscopic mucosal resection". Antrectomy or other surgery is used as a last resort for GAVE.<ref name="Antrectomy" /><ref name="rare" /><ref name="Unusual" /><ref name="Argon" /><ref name="Portal" /><ref name="ablation" /><ref name="cirrhotic" /><ref name="resection" /> The risks of surgery should be considered.<ref name="Argon" /><ref name="resection" /> It is said that "surgery is the only cure" for GAVE.<ref name="rare" />
