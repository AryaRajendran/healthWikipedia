 Fordyce's spots (not to be confused with Angiokeratoma of Fordyce (also known as "Angiokeratoma of the scrotum and vulva")) are small, painless, raised, pale, red or white spots or bumps 1 to 3Â mm in diameter that may appear on the scrotum, shaft of the penis or on the labia, as well as the inner surface (retromolar mucosa) and vermilion border of the lips of the face. They are common in men and women of all ages. They are named after an American dermatologist, John Addison Fordyce. On the foreskin they are called Tyson's glands, not to be confused with hirsuties coronae glandis.The spots are a form of ectopic sebaceous gland: normally, sebaceous glands are only found in association with a hair follicle. They are not known to be associated with any disease or illness and are of cosmetic concern only. They are not infectious and are a natural occurrence on the body. Men with this condition sometimes consult with a dermatologist because they are worried they may have a sexually transmitted disease (especially genital warts) or some form of cancer. Vaporising laser treatments such as CO<sub>2</sub> laser or electro desiccation have been used with some success in diminishing the appearance of this condition if they are of cosmetic concern, despite the fact that most doctors consider this a normal physiological phenomenon and advise against treatment. Success varies per patient, but some have found relief from pulsed dye Lasers, a laser normally used to treat sebaceous gland hyperplasia, which is similar to Fordyce spots. Treatment with pulsed dye lasers is expensive, but may be less likely to scar than other methods. Recently a Professor of plastic surgery in Germany, Professor Norbert Pallua, based in Aachen has pioneered a new method of Fordyce Spot treatment using micro-punch excision. Good cosmetic results were achieved and no recurrence of the Fordyce spots has been reported in 23 patients treated.
