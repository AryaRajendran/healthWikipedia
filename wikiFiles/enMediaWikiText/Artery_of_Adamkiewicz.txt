 In human anatomy, the Artery of Adamkiewicz is the largest anterior segmental medullary artery. It has several other names, including: It typically arises from a left posterior intercostal artery, which branches from the aorta, and supplies the lower two thirds of the spinal cord via the anterior spinal artery. The spinal cord vasculature has a complex and highly variable anatomy.In a study of approximately 70 people that examined the spinal cord's blood supply it was found that: In 75% of people, the artery of Adamkiewicz originates on the left side of the aorta between the T8 and L1 vertebral segments. In an extensive literature review, recognition of the AKA using CT and/or MR was achieved in 466 of 555 cases (83.96%)and in 384 (83.3%) cases the AKA originated from a left intercostal artery. "Great radicular artery of Adamkiewiczâ€¦ provides the major blood supply to the lumbar and sacral cord." When damaged or obstructed, it can result in anterior spinal artery syndrome, with loss of urinary and fecal continence and impaired motor function of the legs; sensory function is often preserved to a degree. It is important to identify the location of the artery when treating a thoracic aortic aneurysm or a thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm. Its location can be identified with computed tomographic angiography. It is named for Albert Wojciech Adamkiewicz.
