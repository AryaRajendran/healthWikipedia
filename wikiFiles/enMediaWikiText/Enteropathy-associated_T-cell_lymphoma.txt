 Enteropathy-Associated T-cell Lymphoma (EATL), also enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma (ETTL), is a type of T-cell lymphoma that affects the small intestine. It is the most common primary gastrointestinal T-cell lymphoma, arising from the T cells that are found between the cells that line the small intestinal (brush border cells or small intestinal epithelial cells). These cancerous T-cells are a consequence of prolonged, untreated coeliac disease in genetically susceptible individuals. EATL is most frequent in Europe, where it represents 9.4% of all Peripheral T cell lymphomas. Association with celiac disease is consistently demonstrated in only 30% of patients. The global incidence of this lymphoma is rare, being about 0.5 to 1 per million. EATL can be classified as an extranodal Peripheral T Cell lymphoma, category it shares with Hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma, and Panniculitic T Cell lymphoma. It can be further classified in type I and II EATL. Enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is environmentally induced as a result of the consumption of Triticeae glutens (e.g. wheat gluten). In gluten-sensitive individuals with EATL, 68% are homozygotes of the DQB1 subtype at the HLA-DQB1 locus . (See Coeliac Disease, HLA-DQ, HLA DR3-DQ2) A DQ isoform that appears to be responsible for EATL in the overwhelming number of cases is highly effective at presenting a proteolytically protected region of α2-gliadin to T-cells, constant over-stimulation of T-cell eventually results in neoplastic growth. EATL typically appears after the 4th decade of life, within 3 years of coeliac disease diagnosis or in undiagnosed coeliacs. In treated coeliacs, EATL may be preceded by refractory coeliac disease 1(RCD1) or, prominently, refractory celiac disease 2 (RCD2), in which EATL is a frequent outcome Refractory coeliac disease is no longer favorably responsive to wheat-gluten abstinence. Beyond the RCD1 stage, many drugs are not effective, and undetected coeliac disease leading to de novo EATL generally has a poor outcome. The genetic association with celiac disease and HLA loci defines type I EATL. Type II doesn´t show these associations and frequently presents with bulky disease. Early recognition of coeliac disease, particularly with a focus on DQ2 homozygotes and in affected family members, is the only effective prevention, though bone marrow transplant was suggested as a treatment during early RCD2. Bone marrow involvement is rare in this disease. EATL has mainly been treated with CHOP and CHOP-like regimens, the exposure to anthracycline drugs being a favorable prognostic factors. According to the Peripheral T cell lymphoma project, median overall survival is 10 months, while median failure free survival is only 6 months. The international prognostic index is not useful in defining prognosis in this entity, but Peripheral Index for T cell lymphoma is. Among the most influential prognostic factors is bulky disease, defined by a tumor mass >5cm.
