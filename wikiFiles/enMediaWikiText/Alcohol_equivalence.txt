This is approximately "a 330ml can of beer or a 100ml glass of table wine or a 30ml glass of straight spirits". In the UK, one standard drink or "unit" of alcohol is defined as 10ml or 8g of pure alcohol. This equals one 25ml single measure of spirits,(ABV 40%), or a third of a pint of beer (ABV 5-6%), or half a standard (175ml) glass of red wine (ABV 12%).
