 Hemoscrotum (or haemoscrotum in British English) is a condition in which blood accumulates inside the scrotum. Hemoscrotum can follow trauma (such as a straddle injury) or can be a complication of surgery. It cais often accompanied by testicular pain. It has been reported in patients with hemophilia and following catheterization of the femoral artery. If the diagnosis is not clinically evident, transillumination (with a penlight against the scrotum) will show a non-translucent fluid inside the scrotum. Ultrasound imaging may also be useful in confirming the diagnosis. In severe or non-resolving cases, surgical incision and drainage may be required. To prevent recurrence following surgical drainage, a drain may be left at the surgical site.
