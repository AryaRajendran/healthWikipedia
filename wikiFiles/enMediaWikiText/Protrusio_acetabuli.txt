 Protrusio acetabuli is an uncommon defect of the acetabulum. The acetabulum is the socket that receives the femoral head to make the hip joint. The hip bone of the pelvic bone/girdle is composed of three bones, the ilium, the ischium and the pubis. In protrusio deformity, there is medial displacement of the femoral head in that the medial aspect of the femoral cortex is medial to the ilioischial line. The socket is too deep and may protrude into the pelvis. Protrusio acetabuli is divided into two types, primary and secondary. Causes include: Protrusio acetabuli may also be thought of as unilateral or bilateral. (Source Dahnert's Radiology) In addition, protrusio acetabuli may be present bilaterally in Paget's disease, Marfan syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and osteomalacia; The protrusio may progress until the femoral neck impinges against the pelvis. Arthroscopic surgery (or open joint surgery) is an effective treatment. Joint replacement surgery may be necessary in the case of severe pain or substantial joint restriction.Prominent trabeculae. * Normal sacro-iliac joints and symphysis pubis.
