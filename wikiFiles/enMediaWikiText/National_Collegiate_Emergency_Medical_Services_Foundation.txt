 The National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation (NCEMSF) is a non-profit organization founded to promote and advocate for campus based emergency medical services. The organization was founded in 1993 with the goal of facilitating the exchange of information amongst collegiate EMS agencies. In 1994, NCEMSF held its first annual conference, which have since become a cornerstone of the organization. In the early 1990s, with the widespread use of computers linked via the precursor to the Internet, e-mail communication among campus emergency responders was commonplace. For readers of the emergency services Usenet group (misc.emerg-services) and its related e-mail list (EMERG-L), there was occasionally a thread about campus-related EMS. But frequently, discussions on the topic of campus EMS were shunned as inappropriate or obscure. As a result, the campus EMS groups that existed were isolated since there was no good forum where they could openly communicate with each other. In 1993, in response to a need for information exchange among campus EMS groups, the National Collegiate EMS Foundation (NCEMSF) was established. A loosely associated nationwide group of campus responders was formally brought together by Jon Diorio of Georgetown University (Washington, DC) and others. Filling a niche, NCEMSF quickly grew. In April 1994 NCEMSF held its first conference at Georgetown University. Representatives from over twenty campus EMS organizations spent the weekend of April 8-10 learning about EMS, meeting each other, and having a great time. Annual conferences every year since 1994 have been a cornerstone of NCEMSF. Providing the networking and information exchange among campus emergency responders remains one of our main goals. Since 1994, the NCEMSF has held a yearly conference hosted by a member college or university.
