 A cardiac fibroma is a rare benign tumor of the heart that occurs primarily in children. It is most commonly located in the interventricular septum or left ventricular wall. Symptoms depend on the size of the tumor, its location relative to the conduction system, and whether it obstructs blood flow. Symptomatic cardiac fibromas may be treated by surgical resection.
