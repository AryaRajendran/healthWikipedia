 .]]Intravascular lymphoma, also referred to as angiotropic large cell lymphoma, intralymphatic lymphomatosis, intravascular lymphomatosis, and "Malignant angioendotheliomatosis", is a condition that may present with variable symptoms, includingvarious cutaneous morphologies (that are often very subtle and non-specific), and CNS symptoms. Most intravascular lymphomas are of the B-cell lineage. Intravascular lymphoma is a condition that may present with non-specific symptoms and, thus, may be difficult to diagnose in a timely manner. Presentations may include non-specific cutaneous lesions, and/or CNS involvement. The diagnosis is established by the examination of tissue under the microscope (i.e. biopsy or autopsy). Intravascular lymphomas have a large cell morphology, i.e. the malignant cells are two or more times the size of a normal lymphocyte, and typically have a prominent nucleolus. It used to be known as malignant angioendotheliomatosis, as it was once thought to arise from the endothelium.
