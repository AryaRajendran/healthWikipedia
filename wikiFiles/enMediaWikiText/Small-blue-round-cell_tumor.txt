 In histopathology, a small-, round-, blue-cell tumor (abbreviated SRBCT), also known as a small-blue-round-cell tumour (SBRCT) or a small-round-cell tumour (SRCT), is any one of a group of malignant neoplasms that have a characteristic appearance under the microscope, i.e. consisting of small round cells that stain blue on routine [[H&E; stain]]ed sections. These tumors are more typically seen in children than adults. They typically represent undifferentiated cells. The predominance of blue staining is due the fact that the cells consist predominantly of nucleus, thus they have scant cytoplasm. Tumors that belong to this group are: Endometrial stromal condensation may mimic a small-blue-round-cell tumour.
