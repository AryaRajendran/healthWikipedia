 Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) or erythroblastopenia refers to a type of anemia affecting the precursors to red blood cells but not to white blood cells. In PRCA, the bone marrow ceases to produce red blood cells. The condition has been first described by Paul Kaznelson in 1922. Causes include: PRCA is considered an autoimmune disease as it will respond to immunosuppressant treatment such as ciclosporin in many patients, though this approach is not without risk. It has also been shown to respond to treatments with Rituxan and Tacrolimus.
