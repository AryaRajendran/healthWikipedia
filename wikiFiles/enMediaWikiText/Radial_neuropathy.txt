 Radial neuropathy (or radial mononeuropathy) is a type of mononeuropathy which results from acute trauma to the radial nerve that extends the length of the arm. It is known as transient paresthesia when sensation is temporarily abnormal. There are a number of colloquial terms used to describe radial nerve injuries, which are usually dependent on the causation factor: Symptoms vary depending on the severity and location of the trauma; however, common symptoms include wrist drop (the inability to extend the wrist upward when the hand is palm down); numbness of the back of the hand and wrist; and inability to voluntarily straighten the fingers. Loss of extension is due to paralysis of the posterior compartment of forearm muscles; although the arm extensors are also innervated by the radial nerve, their innervation is usually spared. There are many ways to acquire radial nerve palsy. The term Saturday Night Palsy refers to an injury to the radial nerve in the spiral groove of the humerus caused while sleeping in a position that would under normal circumstances cause discomfort. It can occur when a person falls asleep while heavily medicated and/or under the influence of alcohol with the underside of the arm compressed by a bar edge, bench, chair back, or like object. Sleeping with the head resting on the arm can also cause radial nerve palsy. Breaking the humerus and deep puncture wounds can also cause the condition. Posterior interosseus palsy is distinguished from radial nerve palsy by the preservation of wrist extension. Radial neuropathy is not necessarily permanent. Peripheral nerve regeneration is an imperfect and slow process, and full restoration of ability may take months, years, or may never occur.
