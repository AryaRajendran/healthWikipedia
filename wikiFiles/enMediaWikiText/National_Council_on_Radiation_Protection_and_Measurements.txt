 The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP), formerly the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and before that the U.S. Advisory Committee on X-Ray and Radium Protection (ACXRP), is a U.S. organization. It has a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code, but this does not imply it has any sort of oversight or supervision from Congress; it is not a government entity. WR Ney (1964 to 1997)WM Beckner (1997 to 2004)DA Schauer (2004 to present) In 2012, a year after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, John Boice, professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and President Nominee of the NCRP, said that "the exposures to the population are very, very low”, adding “As such, there is no opportunity to conduct epidemiological studies that have any chance of detecting excess [cancer] risk. The doses are just too low.”
