 Max Joseph Oertel (March 20, 1835 - July 17, 1897) was a German physician. He developed a system for the correction of respiratory troubles, and invented the laryngeal stroboscope. Oertel was a native of Dillingen. In 1863 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Munich, where he spent the following four years as assistant to Karl von Pfeufer (1806-1869). In 1867 he received his habilitation, attaining a professorship at Munich in 1876. He is credited with being the first physician to use a laryngeal stroboscope for examination of the larynx. He combined a stroboscopic lamp with a laryngeal mirror in order to study "vocal movements" in different registers. Application of the strobe light allowed him to view the vibrating vocal cords in slow motion, thus enabling detailed views of the larynx in an open or closed position. Oertel was the author of a number of written works on cardiac, circulatory and obesity disorders, and was an early advocate of the "terrain cure", a set of therapeutic exercises that involved graduated hiking and climbing. Oertel made contributions to the study of diphtheria by reproducing the disease in laboratory rabbits. {{Persondata | NAME = Oertel, Max Joseph | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION = German physician| DATE OF BIRTH = March 20, 1835| PLACE OF BIRTH = Dillingen| DATE OF DEATH = July 17, 1897 | PLACE OF DEATH =}}
