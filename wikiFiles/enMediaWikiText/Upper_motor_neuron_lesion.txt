 An upper motor neuron lesion (also known as pyramidal insufficiency) is a lesion of the neural pathway above the anterior horn cell of the spinal cord or motor nuclei of the cranial nerves. This is in contrast to a lower motor neuron lesion, which affects nerve fibers traveling from the anterior horn of the spinal cord to the relevant muscle(s). Upper motor neuron lesions occur in conditions affecting motor neurons in the brain or spinal cord such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and cerebral palsy. Changes in muscle performance can be broadly described as the Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome. These changes vary depending on the site and the extent of the lesion, and may include: These are the neural tracts which descend in the spinal cord, in the lateral columns, carrying signals for voluntary movement of skeletal muscle. These nerve fibers usually originate in the primary motor cortex, pass via the corona radiata to gather in the internal capsule before crossing over to the opposite side (decussation) in the medullary pyramids and proceeding down the spinal cord to meet lower motor neurons in the anterior horn.
