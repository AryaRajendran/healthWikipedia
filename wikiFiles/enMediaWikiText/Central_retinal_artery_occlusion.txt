 Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a disease of the eye where the flow of blood through the central retinal artery is blocked (occluded). There are several different causes or etiologies of this occlusion, the most common is carotid artery atherosclerosis. The patient with central retinal artery occlusion will present with sudden acute, painless loss of vision in one eye. Physical exam will show a cherry red spot. The ophthalmic artery branches off into the central retinal artery which travels with the optic nerve until it enters the eye. This central retinal artery provides nutrients to the retina of the eye, more specifically the inner retina and the surface of the optic nerve. Risk factors for CRAO are: being between 60 and 65 years of age, being over the age of 40, male gender, hypertension, caucasian, smoking and diabetes mellitus. The most common etiology for CRAO is carotid artery atherosclerosis. In patients of 70 years of age and older, and giant cell arteritis is more likely to be the cause than in younger patients. Other causes can include dissecting aneurysms and arterial spasms. No good therapy currently exists and several of the various treatments available are often questionable. Some existing treatments include ocular massage, anterior chamber paracentesis and inhalation therapy. With time the artery can recapitalize and the edema can clear. However, visual loss is permanent. Irreversible damage to neural tissue occurs after only 90 minutes. Two thirds of patients experience 20/400 vision while only one in six will experience 20/40 vision or better.
