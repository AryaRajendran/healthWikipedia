 [[Image:Syphilis world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|450px|Age-standardized death from syphilis per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.]]Syphilis is believed to have infected people in 1999 with greater than 90% of cases in the developing world. It affects between 700,000 and 1.6 million pregnancies a year resulting in spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and congenital syphilis. In Sub-Saharan Africa syphilis contributes to approximately 20% of perinatal deaths. In the developed world, syphilis infections were in decline until the 1980s and 1990s due to widespread use of antibiotics. Since the year 2000, rates of syphilis have been increasing in the US, UK, Australia and Europe primarily among men who have sex with men. This is attributed to unsafe sexual practices. Increased rates among heterosexuals have occurred in China and Russia since the 1990s. Syphilis increases the risk of HIV transmission by two to five times and co-infection is common (30–60% in a number of urban centers). Untreated it has a mortality of 8% to 58% with a greater death rate in males. The symptoms of syphilis have become less severe over the 19th and 20th century in part due to widespread availability of effective treatment and partly due to decreasing virulence of the spirochete. With early treatment few complications result. In China rates of syphilis have increased from the 1990s to the 2010s. This occurred after a successful campaign to reduce rates was carried out in the 1950s. Rates of diagnosis are higher in urban coastal areas. This may be due to sexual practices or better diagnosis in these areas. Rates of syphilis in 2000–2005 among low risk groups such as women without children and unmarried people were about 0.3–0.6% while rates among high risk groups such as drug users and MSM were about 7–15%. Rates are greatest among men who have sex with men and sex workers. The increase has been attributed to a number of factors including: migration from rural communities to urban environments, increased numbers of unmarried men, limited screening for disease, partners not always getting notification, and the fact that high risk groups frequently do not seek health care. In Europe rates of syphilis are higher in eastern and southern countries than in western ones. Rates of congenital syphilis have decreased between the 1980 and 2000s due to better access to prenatal care. In the United States rates of syphilis have increased among men between 2000 and 2007. Rates are currently six times greater in men than women and seven times greater in African Americans than Caucasians. More than 60% of cases are in men who have sex with men. It occurs most commonly in those between 15-40 years of age. In the United States, rates of syphilis as of 2007 were six times greater in men than women while they were nearly equal in 1997. Rates are also greater in African Americans and Hispanics than in Caucasians.
