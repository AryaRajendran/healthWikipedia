 The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, usually just FIGO ("fee'go") as the acronym of its French name Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique, is a worldwide NGO organisation representing obstetricians and gynaecologists in over one hundred territories. It was founded on 26 July 1954 in Geneva, Switzerland as an organisation representing 42 national societies. Membership is currently composed of 124 professional societies of obstetricians and gynaecologists worldwide. The headquarters of FIGO was initially located at Geneva, Switzerland. The FIGO Secretariat is located at London. The aim of FIGO is to "promote the well-being of women and to raise the standard of practice in obstetrics and gynaecology". It is financed by dues of member societies, grants, and educational activities. FIGO's work covers many aspects of obstetrics and gynaecology such as oncology, STDs/AIDS, perinatal health, education, safe motherhood, the pathology of the breast, medical terminology, social activities on women's health, new technology and ethics. Major publications include- FIGO conducts a triennial meeting, the "World Congress of Obstetrics and Gynaecology".. In addition the society sponsors fellowships, lectures, provides reports about women’s health, and offers grants. Importantly through international committees consensus guidelines are achieved about evaluation and treatment of gynaecological and obstetrical disorders. Thus the FIGO staging system for gynaecological malignancy is generally accepted.
