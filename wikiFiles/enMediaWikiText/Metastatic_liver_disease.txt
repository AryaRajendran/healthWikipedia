 A liver metastasis is a malignant tumor in the liver that has spread from another organ affected by cancer. The liver is a common site for metastatic disease because it is rich, dual blood supply (the liver receives blood via the hepatic artery and portal vein), which is 20 times more common than primary ones. In 50% of all cases of primary tumor is gastrointestinal tract, other common sites include the breast, ovaries, bronchus and kidney. Tumor emboli entering the sinusoids through the liver blood supply appear to be physically obstructed by the Kupffer cells, but if tumor emboli are larger, they tend to become lodged in the portal venous branches. For most patients no effective treatment exists --- because both lobes usually involved --- making surgical resection impossible. Younger patients with metastases from colorectal cancer, confined to one lobe of liver and up to 4 in number, may be treated by partial hepatectomy. In selected cases, chemotherapy may be given systematically or via hepatic artery. In some tumors, notably arising from the colon and rectum, apparently solitary metastases/metastases to one or other lobes --- may be resected. Careful search for other metastases is required, including local recurrence of original primary tumor (e.g.:colonoscopy) and dissemination elsewhere (e.g.:CT of thorax) --- 5 year survival rates of 30-40% have been reported following resection
