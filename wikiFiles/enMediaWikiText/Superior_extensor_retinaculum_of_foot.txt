 The superior extensor retinaculum of the foot (transverse crural ligament) of the ankle is the upper part of the anterior annular ligament. The transverse crural ligament binds down the tendons of Extensor digitorum longus, Extensor hallucis longus, Peron√¶us tertius, and Tibialis anterior as they descend on the front of the tibia and fibula; under it are found also the anterior tibial vessels and deep peroneal nerve. It is found on the lateral side of the lower leg, attached laterally to the lower end of the fibula, and medially to the tibia; above it is continuous with the fascia of the leg.
