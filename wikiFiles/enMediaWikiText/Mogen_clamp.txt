 The Mogen clamp, one of the three most common circumcision devices, was invented by Rabbi Harry Bronstein in 1954. It has two flat blades that open approximately 3 mm. The name "Mogen clamp" is a general term for a style of clamp; there are several different manufacturers of specific models. Rabbi Harry Bronstein, a mohel from Brooklyn, invented the Mogen clamp in 1954. The name "Mogen" was derived from the Hebrew word מגן (magen), which means shield. Bronstein hoped to standardize circumcision equipment for mohels and doctors. Medical literature reports that the Mogen clamp is (probably) the third most popular circumcision clamp (after Plastibell and Gomco) used by medical practitioners in hospitals. The hospital circumcision procedure with the Mogen clamp is as follows: The hospital procedure usually takes three to four minutes and is virtually bloodless. A 1984 study of 313 circumcisions using the Mogen clamp states "Circumcision using the Mogen clamp is a simple quick, and safe procedure." The study showed that the "complication rate was low (1.6%)." If the Mogen clamp is placed inappropriately, or is otherwise used in a way outside the manufacturer's specifications, injury to or removal of a portion of the glans penis is possible; several cases of this occurring have been reported. A Massachusetts lawsuit regarding a circumcision performed using Mogen Circumcision Instruments' clamp resulted in a $7.5 million judgement against Mogen Circumcision Instruments of New York in 2007. This judgment caused Mogen to go into default. In a case in which 85% of a child's glans penis was accidentally amputated, and could not be reattached, a lawsuit was filed against Miltex Inc., Miltex Inc.'s parent company Integra Life Sciences Holding Corp., and the doctor who performed the circumcision. Miltex Inc. and Integra Life Sciences Holding Corp. were ordered to pay the child and his mother $4.6 million. The lawsuit against the doctor was dismissed.
