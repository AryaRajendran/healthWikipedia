 Miodrag Stojković () (born on July 5, 1964 in Leskovac, Serbia, then Yugoslavia) is a Serbian researcher in genetics with the Institute of Human Genetics at Newcastle University. He holds a PhD from the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich. As of January 2006, he is serving as a Deputy Director and Head of Cellular Reprogramming Laboratory, Centro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe, Valencia, Spain. According to the TIME magazine, Stojković caused a controversy when he tried to create human embryos by injecting a patient's own DNA into an egg from which the genetic material has been removed. He then hopes to harvest stem cells—which can develop into almost any organ—and coax them to produce insulin in diabetics. The research could lead to cure of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and heart diseases.[1] In a German TV show "Menschen bei Maischberger " (ARD;6/6/2006) he claimed that due to stem cell therapy paraplegic patients will be able to walk in the upcoming three years. {{Persondata | NAME = Stojkovic, Miodrag | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Serbian geneticist| DATE OF BIRTH = July 5, 1964 | PLACE OF BIRTH =| DATE OF DEATH =| PLACE OF DEATH =}}
