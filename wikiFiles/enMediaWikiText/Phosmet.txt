 Phosmet is a phthalimide-derived, non-systemic, organophosphate insecticide used on plants and animals. It is mainly used on apple trees for control of codling moth, though it is also used on a wide range of fruit crops, ornamentals, and vines for the control of aphids, suckers, mites, and fruit flies. Phosmet is on the US Emergency Planning List of Extremely Hazardous Substances. It is highly toxic to bees. Mark Purdey has made the controversial suggestion that phosmet may have played a key role in the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). A 2010 study found that each 10-fold increase in urinary concentration of organophosphate metabolites was associated with a 55% to 72% increase in the odds of ADHD in children.
