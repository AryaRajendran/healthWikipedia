 A supernumerary nipple (also known as a third nipple, triple nipple, accessory nipple, polythelia or the related condition: polymastia) is an additional nipple occurring in mammals, including humans. Often mistaken for moles, supernumerary nipples are diagnosed at a rate of 1 in 18 males and 1 in approximately 50 female humans. The nipples appear along the two vertical "milk lines", which start in the armpit on each side, run down through the typical nipples and end at the groin. They are classified into eight levels of completeness from a simple patch of hair to a milk-bearing breast in miniature. type glandular tissue nipple Polythelia refers to the presence of an additional nipple alone while polymastia denotes the much rarer presence of additional mammary glands. Although usually presenting on the milk line, pseudomamma can appear as far away as the foot. A possible relationship with mitral valve prolapse has been proposed. According to Ainsley Newson of Times Online, Romans regarded a third nipple a sign of reinforced femininity while in Salem, an extra nipple was held to be indicative that the woman concerned was a witch; the nipple being used to suckle the devil. The same source asserts that Anne Boleyn (one of the wives of Henry VIII) also fell victim of such belief.
