 CSF glucose or glycorrhachia is a measurement used to determine the levels of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid. It can be useful in distinguishing among causes of meningitis. It is more likely to be decreased in bacterial meningitis than in viral meningitis. Normal CSF glucose is between 45 and 80Â mg/dl. <div style="float:right;border:solid 10px white;"></div>
