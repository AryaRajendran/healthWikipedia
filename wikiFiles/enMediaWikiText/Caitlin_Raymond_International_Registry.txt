The officers of CRIR are Gary Lapidas, Robert Feldmann, and Francis Smith and the organization's directors are John Budd, Brian Carroll, Frederick Crocker, William Kelleher, Gary Lapidas, John O'Brien, and William Sullivan. The registry became the target of criticism when it was discovered that the UMass lab was billing the insurance of potential donors as much as $4336 per screening. (Most labs charge about $100 for similar screening.) CRIR has also been criticized for spending up to $60,000 a week to hire models with blue wigs and high heels to lure donors and for paying its top executive, Joanne Raymond, over $200,000 in annual salary and benefits. The registry reported revenues of over $5 million during the same period. CRIR and UMass are currently under investigation by the attorneys general of New Hampshire and Massachusetts. New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have laws requiring insurers to pay for bone marrow screening.
