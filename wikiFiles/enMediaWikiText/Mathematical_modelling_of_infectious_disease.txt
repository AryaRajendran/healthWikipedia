 Mathematical models can project how infectious diseases progress to show the likely outcome of an epidemic and help inform public health interventions. Models use some basic assumptions and mathematics to find parameters for various infectious diseases and use those parameters to calculate the effects of possible interventions, like mass vaccination programmes. Early pioneers in infectious disease modelling were William Hamer and Ronald Ross, who in the early twentieth century applied the law of mass action to explain epidemic behaviour. Lowell Reed and Wade Hampton Frost developed the Reed-Frost epidemic model to describe the relationship between susceptible, infected and immune individuals in a population. Models are only as good as the assumptions on which they are based. If a model makes predictions which are out of line with observed results and the mathematics is correct, the initial assumptions must change to make the model useful. An infectious disease is said to be endemic when it can be sustained in a population without the need for external inputs. This means that, on average, each infected person is infecting exactly one other person (any more and the number of people infected will grow exponentially and there will be an epidemic, any less and the disease will die out). In mathematical terms, that is: <math>\ {R_0} \times {S} = {1}.</math> The basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>) of the disease, assuming everyone is susceptible, multiplied by the proportion of the population that is actually susceptible (S) must be one (since those who are not susceptible do not feature in our calculations as they cannot contract the disease). Notice that this relation means that for a disease to be in the endemic steady state, the higher the basic reproduction number, the lower the proportion of the population susceptible must be, and vice versa. The first assumption (above) lets us say that everyone in the population lives to age L and then dies. If the average age of infection is A, then on average individuals younger than A are susceptible and those older than A are immune (or infectious). Thus the proportion of the population that is susceptible is given by: <math>{S} = \frac {A} {L}.</math> But the mathematical definition of the endemic steady state can be rearranged to give: <math>{S} = \frac {1} {R_0}.</math> Therefore, since things equal to the same thing are equal to each other: <math>\frac {1} {R_0} = \frac {A} {L} \Rightarrow {R_0} = \frac {L} {A}.</math> This provides a simple way to estimate the parameter R<sub>0</sub> using easily available data. For a population with an exponential age distribution, <math>{R_0} = {1} + \frac {L} {A}.</math> This allows for the basic reproduction number of a disease given A and L in either type of population distribution. Mathematical models need to integrate the increasing volume of data being generated on host-pathogen interactions. Many theoretical studies of the population dynamics, structure and evolution of infectious diseases of plants and animals, including humans, are concerned with this problem. Research topics include: If the proportion of the population that is immune exceeds the herd immunity level for the disease, then the disease can no longer persist in the population. Thus, if this level can be exceeded by vaccination, the disease can be eliminated. An example of this being successfully achieved worldwide is the global eradication of smallpox, with the last wild case in 1977. The WHO is carrying out a similar vaccination campaign to eradicate polio. The herd immunity level will be denoted q. Recall that, for a stable state: <math>\ {R_0} \cdot {S} = {1}.</math> S will be (1 − q), since q is the proportion of the population that is immune and q + S must equal one (since in this simplified model, everyone is either susceptible or immune). Then: <math> \ {R_0} \cdot ({1}-{q}) = {1}, </math><math> {1}-{q} = \frac {1} {R_0}, </math><math> {q} = {1} - \frac {1} {R_0}. </math> Remember that this is the threshold level. If the proportion of immune individuals exceeds this level due to a mass vaccination programme, the disease will die out. We have just calculated the critical immunisation threshold (denoted q<sub>c</sub>). It is the minimum proportion of the population that must be immunised at birth (or close to birth) in order for the infection to die out in the population. <math> {q_c} = {1} - \frac {1} {R_0} </math> If the vaccine used is insufficiently effective or the required coverage cannot be reached (for example due to popular resistance), the programme may fail to exceed q<sub>c</sub>. Such a programme can, however, disturb the balance of the infection without eliminating it, often causing unforeseen problems. Suppose that a proportion of the population q (where q < q<sub>c</sub>) is immunised at birth against an infection with R<sub>0</sub>>1. The vaccination programme changes R<sub>0</sub> to R<sub>q</sub> where <math>\ {R_q} = {R_0}{({1}-{q})}</math> This change occurs simply because there are now fewer susceptibles in the population who can be infected. R<sub>q</sub> is simply R<sub>0</sub> minus those that would normally be infected but that cannot be now since they are immune. As a consequence of this lower basic reproduction number, the average age of infection A will also change to some new value A<sub>q</sub> in those who have been left unvaccinated. Recall the relation that linked R<sub>0</sub>, A and L. Assuming that life expectancy has not changed, now: <math>\ {R_q} = \frac {L} {A_q},</math><math>\ {A_q} = \frac {L} {R_q} = \frac {L} {{R_0}({1}-{q})}.</math> But R<sub>0</sub> = L/A so: <math>\ {A_q} = \frac {L} {({L}/{A})({1}-{q})} = \frac {AL} {{L}({1}-{q})} = \frac {A} {{1}-{q}}.</math> Thus the vaccination programme will raise the average age of infection, another mathematical justification for a result that might have been intuitively obvious. Unvaccinated individuals now experience a reduced force of infection due to the presence of the vaccinated group. However, it is important to consider this effect when vaccinating against diseases that are more severe in older people. A vaccination programme against such a disease that does not exceed q<sub>c</sub> may cause more deaths and complications than there were before the programme was brought into force as individuals will be catching the disease later in life. These unforeseen outcomes of a vaccination programme are called perverse effects. If a vaccination programme causes the proportion of immune individuals in a population to exceed the critical threshold for a significant length of time, transmission of the infectious disease in that population will stop. This is known as elimination of the infection and is different from eradication.
