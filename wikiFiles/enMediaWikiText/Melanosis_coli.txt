 Melanosis coli, also pseudomelanosis coli, is a disorder of pigmentation of the wall of the colon, often identified at the time of colonoscopy. It is benign, and may have no significant correlation with disease. The brown pigment is lipofuscin in macrophages, not melanin. The most common cause of melanosis coli is the extended use of laxatives, and commonly anthraquinone containing laxatives such as Senna and other plant glycosides. However, other causes are identified, including an increase in colonic epithelial apoptosis. Endoscopically, the mucosa may show a brownish discoloration in a moire pattern. On biopsy, melanosis coli shows characteristic pigment-laden macrophages within the mucosa on PAS staining. The histologic differential diagnosis of mucosal pigmentation is: lipofuscin (melanosis coli), hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and melanin (rare). No adverse effects or consequences of melanosis coli have been identified. The condition is unrelated to true melanoses, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and smoker's melanosis. Peutz-Jegher syndrome causes pigmentation of the skin and mucous surfaces with melanin, and polyps in the digestive tract. Pseudomelanoses of other parts of the gastrointestinal tract have also been reported, and are of unclear relevance. Patients with colostomies can have melanosis involving the stoma, which is also of no significance.
