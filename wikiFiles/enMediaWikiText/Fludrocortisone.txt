 Fludrocortisone (also called 9α-fluorocortisol or 9α-fluorohydrocortisone) is a synthetic corticosteroid with moderate glucocorticoid potency and much greater mineralocorticoid potency. The brand name in the U.S. and Canada is Florinef. Fludrocortisone has been used in the treatment of cerebral salt wasting. It is used primarily to replace the missing hormone aldosterone in various forms of adrenal insufficiency such as Addison's disease and the classic salt wasting (21-hydroxylase deficiency) form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Fludrocortisone is the first line of treatment for orthostatic intolerance and Postural Tachycardia Syndrome as well. Fludrocortisone is also a confirmation test for diagnosing Conns Syndrome (aldosterone producing-adrenal adenoma), the fludrocortisone suppression test. Loading the patient with fludrocortisone would suppress serum aldosterone level in a normal patient, whereas the level will not be altered in a Conns patient. Its effects on increasing Na+ levels, and therefore blood volume, make it useful as an off label treatment for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) Fludrocortisone is available in 0.1 mg tablets. Typical daily doses for mineralocorticoid replacement are between 0.05 mg - 0.2 mg. Renin plasma, sodium, and potassium is checked through blood tests in order to verify that the correct dosage is reached. Chemically, fludrocortisone is identical to cortisol except for the substitution of fluorine in place of one hydrogen. Fluorine is a good bioisostere for hydrogen because it is similar in size. The major difference is in its electronegativity.
