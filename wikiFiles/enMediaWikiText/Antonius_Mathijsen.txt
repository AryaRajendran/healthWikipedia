 Antonius Mathijsen (November 4, 1805â€“June 15, 1878) was a Dutch army surgeon who first used plaster of paris to fixate broken bones. Antonius Mathijsen was born November 4, 1805 to a village physician in Budel, a Dutch town on the Belgian border. He was educated at hospitals in Maastricht, Brussels and the army medical school in Utrecht. He received his commission as medical officer 3d class in the Royal Netherlands Army in 1828. In 1838 he participated in the 10 day war of Belgian Revolution. While working at military hospital Haarlem Mathijsen in 1851 first used plaster of paris as a bandage. He discovered that a bandage soaked in water and plaster of paris hardened within a few minutes and thus made a good fixation for broken bones. He published his findings in a Dutch medical magazine Repertorium in February 1852. He retired from the army in 1868 as first medical officer first class (Lieutenant Colonel). Mathijsen died June 15, 1878, aged 72, in Hamont. Memorial monuments are located in both Budel and Hamont. The last Dutch army hospital in Utrecht was named after Dr Mathijsen until the army hospital merged with the navy hospital in the early 1990s. {{Persondata | NAME = Mathijsen, Antonius | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION =| DATE OF BIRTH = 1805 | PLACE OF BIRTH =| DATE OF DEATH = 1878 | PLACE OF DEATH =}}
