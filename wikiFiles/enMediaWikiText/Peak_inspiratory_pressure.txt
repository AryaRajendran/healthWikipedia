 Peak inspiratory pressure (P<sub>IP</sub>) is the highest level of pressure applied to the lungs during inhalation. In mechanical ventilation the number reflects a positive pressure in centimeters of water pressure (cmH<sub>2</sub>O). In normal breathing, it may sometimes be referred to as the maximal inspiratory pressure (M<sub>IPO</sub>), which is a negative value.
