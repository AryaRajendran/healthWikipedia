 Dyskinesia is a movement disorder which consists of adverse effects including diminished voluntary movements and the presence of involuntary movements, similar to tics or chorea. Dyskinesia can be anything from a slight tremor of the hands to uncontrollable movement of, most commonly, the upper body but can also be seen in the lower extremities. Discoordination can also occur internally especially with the respiratory muscles and it often goes unrecognized. Dyskinesia is a symptom of several medical disorders and is distinguished by the underlying cause. Acute dystonia is a cerebral type of palsy. Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is evident in patients with Parkinson's disease who have been on levodopa for prolonged periods of time. LID commonly first appears in the foot, on the most affected side of the body. There are three main types that can be classified on the basis of their course and clinical presentation following an oral dose of L-dopa: Late onset dyskinesia, also known as tardive dyskinesia, occurs after treatment with an antipsychotic drug such as haloperidol (Haldol) or amoxapine (Asendin). The symptoms include tremors and writhing movements of the body and limbs and abnormal movements in the face, mouth, and tongue, including involuntary lip smacking, repetitive pouting of the lips, and tongue protrusions. Rabbit syndrome is another type of chronic dyskinesia, while orofacial dyskinesia may be related to persistent replication of Herpes Simplex Virus type-1 (Gonzales GR, 1992) Two other types, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and biliary dyskinesia, are caused by specific kinds of ineffective movement of the body, and are not movement disorders.Spastic thrusting of hip area can occur in sodemytopic Parkinson's.
