 The Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance is an organisation providing emergency medical services through the provision of a helicopter air ambulance covering the two counties of Surrey and Sussex in the South East of England, United Kingdom. The helicopter is funded by the Kent Air Ambulance Trust (under the operating names of the Surrey Air Ambulance and Sussex Air Ambulance), which is a registered charity, raising money from public and private donations in excess of Â£3.4m every year between Kent, Sussex and Surrey. The service went into operation on 08 June 1997, covering the two counties of Sussex and Surrey. The trust currently operates one MD-902 "NOTAR" helicopter, G-KSSH, from Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey, which became operational in December 2007, and can fly at nearly 150 miles per hour, making the outer reaches of both counties accessible in minutes. This aircraft was previously operated as G-WMID by the West Midlands Police. The service supplements the existing air ambulance service provided Sussex Police Air Operations Unit, the helicopter run jointly by Sussex Police and South East Coast Ambulance Service. The operation also has a rapid response Mercedes car for the crew to use in the event that the helicopter is grounded for any reason. This vehicle was donated in May 2009 by Sussex Police, having formerly been one of their traffic patrol vehicles. The Trust's mission statement is: "relieve sick and injured people in South East England and surrounding areas by providing a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) and Air Ambulance Service for the benefit of the community". The trust provides air ambulance cover for the entire county, in association with the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who provide the paramedics that fly with the trust on secondment. The trust receives no funding from any government body, instead relying on voluntary donations to meet its running costs.
