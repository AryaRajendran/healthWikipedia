 Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF), is a device that enables a user of the device to speak into a microphone and then hear his or her voice in headphones a fraction of a second later. Some DAF devices are hardware; DAF computer software is also available. DAF usage (with a 175 millisecond delay) has been shown to induce mental stress. Electronic fluency devices use delayed auditory feedback and have been used as a technique to aid with stuttering. Delayed auditory feedback devices are used for example in speech perception experiments, in order to demonstrate the importance of auditory feedback in speech perception as well as in speech production (see e.g. Perkell et al. 1997). Delayed auditory feedback has been used with a directional microphone and speaker to create a device intended to silence an individual speaker using the mental stress induced in people unused to the effect. There are now also different mobile apps available that use DAF in phone calls.
