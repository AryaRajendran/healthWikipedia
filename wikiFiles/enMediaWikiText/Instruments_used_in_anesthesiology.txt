 Following is a list of instruments used in the practice of anesthesia: {| class="wikitable"! Instrument !! Uses|-| Continuous-flow anesthetic machine || used to provide a measured and continuous supply of gases (oxygen, nitrous oxide, etc.), mixed with a required concentration of anesthetic vapor to the patient at a required pressure and rate; vide link|-| Anesthetic vaporizers || vaporizes the anesthetic|-| Oxygen mask || to deliver oxygen or to administer aerosolized or gaseous drugs|-| Nasal oxygen set || to deliver oxygen|-| Guedel airways || hard part of the airway maintenance that connects the mouth part to the pharyngeal part|-| Suction catheter || Suction catheters used to remove secretions from the mouth, oropharynx, trachea and bronchii|-| Peripheral venous catheter || |-| Water & sand weight bag || |-| Artificial resuscitator (Bag valve mask) || manual ventilation|-| Bain circuit || respiratory maintenance circuit|-| Laryngoscope || used to view larynx including the vocal cords, the glottis, etc.|-| Endotracheal tube || a tube introduced into the patient's trachea to maintain a patient to ensure that air reaches the lungs for respiration|-| Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) || a less painful but less useful alternative to an endotracheal tube|-| Tracheostomy tube || it is a metal or plastic tube used to keep an artificial opening in front of the neck into the trachea open to act as an alternative pathway for respiration; vide tracheostomy|-| Endoscopes || to look inside the esophagus, stomach, upper intestines, bile duct, larynx, trachea, bronchi-through the mouth|-| Eschmann stylet or Gum elastic bougie || a flexible device introduced through the mouth during some intubation procedures; if the stylet is in the trachea, while passing in, gives a sensation of bumps and then finally stops going in at a point, it indicates that it was gliding over tracheal rings and has stopped at one of the bronchi (the patient may even cough during this time); if it goes into the esophagus, it will not bump and neither will it stop going in; used to judge where the endotracheal tube has gone in|-| Filters || air filters - to filter out dust particles or certain gases from the gas being given to the patient|-| Needles || for injections, infusions, etc.|-| Tuohy needle || for epidural catheter insertion|-| Lumbar puncture needle / Epidural anesthesia set / Spinal needle || used for puncturing into the spine (or cisterns or fontanelles of a new born) for cerebro-spinal fluid aspiration or for injection drugs, specially anesthetics in spinal blocks, epidurals, etc.|-| Epidural catheter || used to pass drugs into the epidural space|-| Syringe || to inject drugs; larger ones can be used with mucus suckers|-| Mucus sucker || to aspirate any fluid specially mucus from the respiratory passage|-| Variable performance devices || |-| Fixed performance devices || |}NON-KINK CATHTER MOUNT Catheter mounts are of great use in anaesthesia to add that’extra length’ to breathing system when needed.The Non-Kink catheter mount is a modification to the standard catheter mounts used in anaesthesia. Catheter mounts made of plane rubber tubing kink when bent, while those made of corrugated rubber tubing kinked when twisted. This causes a great deal of inconvenience during anaesthesia for neurosurgery and other operations performed on the head and neck. To overcome this difficulty, Dr.A.K Jamil (Anaesthetist,Manchester) designed the catheter mount which he named ;Non-kink catheter mount. He dismantled an ordinary catheter mount and discarded the rubber tube. A No.9 plain endotracheal tube was cut to the required length, covered with the armour of a flexible bath shower and connected to the distal and proximal pieces. The armour was then welded at both ends. The armour prevents kinking during flexion in different planes. The catheter mount may be twisted by about 180 without any change in performance. It has been tried in practice with satisfactory results. General anesthesia does not require the anesthetic machine, tested daily, as basic equipment. Anesthesia machines may differ in appearance, size and degree of sophistication but generally speaking, they consist of sections for: It is imperative that essential medical pipeline gas supply, e.g. oxygen, nitrous oxide and air, are secured firmly to the machine, and readily available without any obstructions, defects or pressure leaks. They should also be checked in between cases, ensuring that the breathing apparatus and breathing circuit are fully patent, for the safe anesthesia of patients. Major manufacturers of anesthetic machines are General Electric (GE), Larsen & Toubro Limited, Draeger and MAQUET.
