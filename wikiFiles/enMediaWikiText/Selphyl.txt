 The "platelet-rich fibrin matrix" (PRFM) method, marketed in the United States as Selphyl and also known as the vampire filler or vampire facelift, is a process in cosmetic surgery. It is a way of extracting platelets from the patient's own blood and using them as a dermal filler – that is, as a substance injected under the skin of the face to fill out wrinkles so as to provide a more youthful appearance. Selphyl is used in outpatient procedures that, , costs about $900 to $1,500 in the U.S. and takes less than half an hour. Blood is drawn from the patient's arm and spun in a centrifuge to separate out the platelets, which are then injected back under the patient's facial skin. It can also be combined with other fillers such as Juvéderm, and a procedure using this combination has been trademarked as "vampire facelift"." Selphyl is available on the U.S. market since 2009. It was developed and is marketed by the Aesthetic Factors corporation. The platelet extraction centrifuge used by Selphyl was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002 as part of a blood collection system, "Fibrinet", for use by orthopedic doctors to speed tissue repair. platelets extracted in this centrifuge have not been cleared or approved by the FDA for facial rejuvenation. Nonetheless, Selphyl has been described as a "FDA approved dermal filler" in YouTube videos and trade publications. The efficacy of Selphyl is contested. , according to a New York Times report, it is attested by several plastic surgeons who use it but remains unproven by research. Phil Haeck, the president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, dismissed the procedure as "creepy", "a gimmick" and as "antiquated as bloodletting". In contrast, a February 2011 studyby Anthony P. Sclafani, a paid consultant for the manufacturer of Selphyl, concluded that "PRFM treatment is a well-tolerated, excellent choice for use in the face".
