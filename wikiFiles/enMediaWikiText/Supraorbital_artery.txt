 The supraorbital artery is an artery of the head. It springs from the ophthalmic artery as that vessel is crossing over to the medial side of the optic nerve. It passes upward on the medial borders of the superior rectus muscle and levator palpebrae superioris, meeting the supraorbital nerve accompanies it between the roof of the orbit and levator palpebrae superioris to the supraorbital notch. When passing through the supraorbital notch it divides into a superficial and a deep branch. Its terminal branches anastomose with branches of the supratrochlear artery and the superficial temporal arteries. This artery supplies the levator palpebrae superioris, the diploÃ« of the frontal bone, the frontal sinus, the upper eyelid, and the skin of the forehead and the scalp. This artery may be absent in 10% to 20% of individuals. <div class="references-small"></div>
