 Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) is the fraction or percentage of oxygen in the space being measured. Medical patients experiencing difficulty breathing are provided with oxygen-enriched air, which means a higher-than-atmospheric FiO<sub>2</sub>. Natural air includes 20.9% oxygen, which is equivalent to FiO<sub>2</sub> of 0.21. Oxygen-enriched air has a higher FiO<sub>2</sub> than 0.21, up to 1.00, which means 100% oxygen. FiO<sub>2</sub> is typically maintained below 0.5 even with mechanical ventilation, to avoid oxygen toxicity. Often used in medicine the FiO<sub>2</sub> is used to represent the percentage of oxygen participating in gas-exchange. If the barometric pressure changes, the FiO<sub>2</sub> may remain constant while the partial pressure of oxygen changes with the change in barometric pressure. P<sub>A</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>E</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and P<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are the partial pressures of oxygen in alveolar, expired, and inspired gas, respectively, and VD/VT is the ratio of physiologic dead space over tidal volume. In medicine the FiO<sub>2</sub> is the assumed percentage of oxygen concentration participating in gas exchange in the alveoli. The ratio between partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) and FiO<sub>2</sub> is used as an indicator of hypoxemia per the American-European Consensus Conference on lung injury. A high FiO<sub>2</sub> has been shown to alter the ratio of PaO2/FiO<sub>2</sub>. The ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen, sometimes called the Carrico index, is a comparison between the oxygen level in the blood and the oxygen concentration that is breathed. This helps to determine the degree of any problems with how the lungs transfer oxygen to the blood. A sample of arterial blood is collected for this test. A PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 200 mmHg is necessary for the diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. A PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 250 mmHg is one of the minor criteria for severe community acquired pneumonia (i.e., possible indication for inpatient treatment). A PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 333 mmHg is one of the variables in the SMART-COP risk score for intensive respiratory or vasopressor support in community-acquired pneumonia. The alveolar air equation is the following formula, used to calculate the partial pressure of alveolar gas:
