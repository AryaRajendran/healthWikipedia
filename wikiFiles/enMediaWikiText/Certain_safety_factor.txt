 The Certain Safety Factor is the ratio of the lethal dose to 1% of population to the effective dose to 99% of the population (LD1/ED99). This is a better safety index than the LD<sub>50</sub> for materials that have both desirable and undesirable effects, because it factors in the ends of the spectrum where doses may be necessary to produce a response in one person but can, at the same dose, be lethal in another. <math>\mbox{Certain safety factor} = \frac{\mathrm{LD}_{1}}{\mathrm{ED}_{99}}</math> http://www.courses.vcu.edu/ptxed/m2/faqs_damaj.htm
