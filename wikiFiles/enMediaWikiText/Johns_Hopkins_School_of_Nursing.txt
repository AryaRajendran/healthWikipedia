The school's mission is to provide leadership to improve health care and advance the nursing profession through education, research, practice, and service. The founder Johns Hopkins' desire for a training school for female nurses was formally stated in a posthumous 1873 instruction letter to the board of trustees of the Johns Hopkins institutions. The School of Nursing in conjunction with the Johns Hopkins Hospital was eventually founded in 1889 after in depth consultation with Florence Nightingale on its planning, organization, structure and curriculum. The Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing is located on the Johns Hopkins University East Baltimore campus along with the Bloomberg School of Public Health, School of Medicine, and the Johns Hopkins Hospital. It is one of the few campuses in the world where highly ranked schools of nursing, medicine, and public health are adjacent to one another and within steps of a top-ranked hospital. The School of Nursing offers a variety of programs from accelerated bachelor's degree to Master's, DNP and PhD programs, online options, post-degree opportunities, and nursing prerequisites.
