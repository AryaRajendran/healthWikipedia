 Toxaphene is an insecticide. It is a mixture of closely related substances whose use is now banned in most of the world due to concerns of toxicity. Toxaphene is a mixture of approximately 200 organic compounds, formed by the chlorination of camphene (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>) to an overall chlorine content of 67-69% by weight. The bulk of the compounds (mostly chlorobornanes, chlorocamphenes, and other bicyclic chloroorganic compounds) found in toxaphene have chemical formulas ranging from C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>11</sub>Cl<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub>, with a mean formula of C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>. The formula weights of these compounds range from 308 to 551 grams/mole; the theoretical mean formula has a value of 414 grams/mole. Toxaphene is usually seen as a yellow to amber waxy solid. It is volatile enough to be transported for long distances through the atmosphere. When inhaled or ingested, sufficient quantities of toxaphene can damage the lungs, nervous system, and kidneys, and may cause death. It is classified as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen. Toxaphene was used as an insecticide. In the U.S., it was chiefly used in the cotton and soybean growing areas in the southeastern region. It was used to treat mange in cattle in California in the 1970s, although there were reports of cattle deaths following spraying with toxaphene. In 1982, it was banned for most uses, and in 1990 it was banned for all uses in the United States. It belongs to the so-called "dirty dozen", a list of very toxic substances, eleven of which were outlawed in May 2004 when the Stockholm Convention went into effect.
