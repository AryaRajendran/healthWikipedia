 The ABCD<sup>2</sup> score is a clinical score to determine the risk for stroke within the first two days following a transient ischemic attack (TIA, a condition in which temporary brain dysfunction results from oxygen shortage in the brain).The score has recently been proposed to be equally useful to predict the risk of recurrent stroke during the first hours following TIA or minor stroke. The ABCD<sup>2</sup> score is based on five parameters: age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of TIA, and presence of diabetes.Each item is scored and the results are added to a result ranging between zero and seven. The ABCD<sup>2</sup> score is a modified version of the ABCD score (which covers the same parameters but without diabetes). ABCD<sup> !! Age !! Blood Pressure !! Clinical Features !! Duration !! Diabetes 0 points <60 years || normal || other than those specified || less than 10 minutes || no diabetes 1 points ≥60 years raised (blood pressure ≥140/90) || speech disturbance without weakness || 10 to 59 minutes || diabetes present 2 points unilateral (one-sided) weakness The risk for stroke can be estimated from the ABCD<sup>2</sup> score as follows:
