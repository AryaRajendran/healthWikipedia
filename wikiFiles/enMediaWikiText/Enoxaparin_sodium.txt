 Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin marketed under the trade names Lovenox, Xaparin and Clexane, among others. It is an anticoagulant used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and is given as a subcutaneous injection (by a health care provider or the patient). Its use is evolving in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Enoxaparin is manufactured by Sanofi and is derived from the intestinal mucosa of pigs. Generic versions are available from Amphastar Pharmaceuticals and Sandoz. Enoxaparin binds to and accelerates the activity of antithrombin III. By activating antithrombin III, enoxaparin preferentially potentiates the inhibition of coagulation factors Xa and IIa. The anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin can be directly correlated to its ability to inhibit factor Xa. Factor Xa catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, so enoxaparin's inhibition of this process results in decreased thrombin and ultimately the prevention of fibrin clot formation. Enoxaparin is an FDA pregnancy category B drug, and is not expected to harm an unborn baby. Enoxaparin does not cross the placenta. In animal models, there was no evidence of teratogenic effects or fetotoxicity due to enoxaparin.Pregnancy alone can raise a woman's risk of life threatening thromboembolic event. Enoxaparin can be used during all stages of pregnancy, however it should be closely monitored by a physician. Protamine is less effective at reversing enoxaparin compared to heparin, with a maximum neutralisation of approximately 60% of the anti-factor Xa effect. 100 mg/mL concentration 150 mg/mL concentration Annual sales approx $3.17 billion.
