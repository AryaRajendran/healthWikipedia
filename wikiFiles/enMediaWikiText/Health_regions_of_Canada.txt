 Health regions, also called health authorities, are a governance model used by Canada's provincial governments to administer and/or deliver public health care to all Canadians. Health care is designated a provincial responsibility under the separation of powers in Canada's federal system. Most health regions or health authorities are organized along geographic boundaries, however, some are organized along operational lines.
