 Danubian endemic familial nephropathy (DEFN), also called Balkan endemic nephropathy, is a form of interstitial nephritis. It was first identified in the 1920s among several small, discrete communities along the Danube River and its major tributaries, in the modern countries of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria. The first official publication was made by the Bulgarian nephrologist Dr. Yoto Tanchev and his team in 1956 in the Bulgarian Journal Savremenna Medizina, a priority generally acknowledged by the international nephrological community. Their study was based on a wide screening of inhabitants of the villages around the town of Vratsa, Bulgaria. Their contribution to the study of this unusual endemic disease of the kidneys consisted in the description of symptoms which were not typical for the common chronic nephritis, i.e., incidence only in adults (no children affected), lack of high blood pressure, xanthochromia of palms and soles (Tanchev's sign), early hypochromic anemia, a lack of proteinuria, and slow progression of kidney failure. A striking feature of the disease is its very localized occurrence. There are approximately ten small areas where it occurs, all of them more or less rural, but nothing seems to connect those areas, other than the occurrence of this illness. Tanchev and colleagues suggested the condition was a disease sui generis. Their initial hypothesis for the etiology was possible intoxication with heavy metals, because the villages affected were supplied with water coming from the nearby karst-type Vratsa Mountain. The first name of the disease was "Vratsa nephritis". Later, following descriptions of similar ailments in Yugoslavia and Romania, the condition became known as Balkan endemic nephropathy. The etiology for DEFN is not certain but chronic exposure to dietary aristolochic acid is known to be a major risk for DEFN and other related disorders. In the Balkan region, dietary aristolochic acid exposure may come from Aristolochia clematitis, or European birthwort, a plant native to the endemic region, and its seeds may comingle with wheat used for bread. This theory has recently gained further support through research by Arthur P. Grollman, cancer biologist and the director of Stony Brook University's chemical biology lab in New York, and Bojan Jelaković, an associate professor at the Zagreb University School of Medicine. Aristolochic acid-containing herbal remedies, typically associated with traditional Chinese medicine, are associated with a related—possibly identical—condition known as "Chinese herbs nephropathy". Exposure to aristolochic acid is associated with a high incidence of uroepithelial tumorigenesis.
