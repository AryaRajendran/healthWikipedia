 A Bartholin's cyst is formed when a Bartholin's gland is blocked, causing a fluid-filled cyst to develop. A Bartholin's cyst is not an infection, although it can be caused by an infection, inflammation, or physical blockage (mucus or other impediment) to the Bartholin's ducts (tubes which lead from the glands to the vulva). If infection sets in, the result is a Bartholin's abscess. If the infection is severe or repeated, a surgical procedure known as marsupialization may be required to stop further recurrences. Bartholin's cysts are most likely to occur in women of child-bearing age although when they occur in women over 40, sometimes the doctor will recommend a biopsy just to be sure there are no cancer cells present, even though cancer of the Bartholin's gland is extremely rare. A Bartholin's cyst can grow from the size of a pea to the size of an egg. Cysts are not sexually transmitted. There is no known reason for their development and infection is rare. However, even with an abscess, a bacterial infection or STD is not the cause. The treatment can depend on one or more of these factors: the size of the cyst, how painful it is, if it is infected, and the patient's age. In some cases, a small cyst can simply be observed over time to see if it grows. In other cases, the doctor can perform a minor procedure in the office, in which a small tube (a catheter) is inserted into the cyst and inflated to keep it in place. The catheter stays in place for 2 to 4 weeks, draining the fluid and causing a normal gland opening to form, after which the catheter is removed. The catheters do not generally impede normal activity, but sexual intercourse is generally abstained from while the catheter is in place. Cysts may also be opened permanently, a method called marsupialization, in which an opening to the gland is formed with stitches which hold the secretion channel open. The cysts are not life-threatening, but can be quite painful and can even make walking difficult. New cysts cannot absolutely be prevented from forming; however, surgical or laser removal of a cyst makes it less likely that a new one will form at the same site. However, those with a cyst are more likely than someone else to get one in the future. They can recur every few years or more frequently. There is not presently a generally agreed-upon explanation in the medical field for the cause of these cysts, nor agreement upon what can be done to help prevent them. Many women who have marsupialization done find that the recurrences may slow, but do not actually stop. If the cyst is infected, it may break open and start to heal on its own after 3 to 4 days. Nonprescription pain medication such as ibuprofen relieve pain, and sitz bath may increase comfort. Warm compresses can speed healing. Disposable chemical heating pads, such as those used inside gloves to keep hands warm, can be worn inside clothing and last for several hours, providing long-lasting relief. If a Bartholin gland abscess comes back several times, the gland and duct can be surgically removed.
