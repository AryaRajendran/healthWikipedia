 Circulating auto-antibodies in the human body can target normal parts of the skin leading to disease. This is a list of antigens in the skin that may become targets of circulating auto-antibodies leading to the various types of pemphigoid. Target antigens for the different pemphigoid variants Pemphigoid variant !! Antibody isotype !! Antigen !! Molecular weight (KDa) Bullous pemphigoid IgG, IgE NC16A terminal of BPAG2BPAG1 Herpes gestationis IgG1 NC16A terminal of BPAG2BPAG1 Cicatricial pemphigoid C-terminal of BPAG2 Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid Integrin beta-4 subunit Antiepiligrin cicatricial pemphigoid Laminin 5 (Epiligrin, Laminin 332) Linear IgA bullous dermatosis LAD1 portion of BPAG2Collagen type VII Protein 105 pemphigoid Protein in lower lamina lucida Of note, there are also several other diseases that are caused by auto-antibodies that target the same anatomic area of the skin which is termed the basement membrane zone. These diseases include: Target antigens for the different autoimmune bullous conditions targeting the basement membrane zone of the human integumentary system, excluding pemphigoid Disease !! Antibody isotype !! Antigen !! Molecular weight (KDa) Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita Collagen type VII Bullous lupus erythematosus Collagen type VII Lichen planus pemphigoides BPAG2
