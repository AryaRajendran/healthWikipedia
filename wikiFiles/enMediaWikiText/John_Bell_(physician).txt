 Sir John Irving Bell, FRS, FMedSci (born 1 July 1952) is a Canadian immunologist and geneticist who resides in the UK. From 2006 to 2011, he was President of the Academy of Medical Sciences, and since 2002 has held the Regius Chair of Medicine at Oxford University, UK. Bell was born in Edmonton, Canada, where his parents worked in haematology and pharmacy. He graduated from the University of Alberta in 1975, and then studied medicine on a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford University. In 1982, he took up a position as Clinical Fellow in Immunology with Hugh McDevitt at Stanford University, California, USA, where he worked on histocompatibility antigens and autoimmune disease. In 1987 Bell returned to Oxford as a Wellcome Trust Senior Clinical Fellow, and joined the Institute of Molecular Medicine, founded by David Weatherall. In 1992 he succeeded Weatherall as the Nuffield Professor of Clinical Medicine and, in 2002, became the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, also after Weatherall. In 1994, Bell was one of the founders of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at Oxford University. He is a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. Bell has been a non-executive director of Roche since 2001. He serves on the scientific advisory board of Roche Palo Alto (from 1998), and formerly served on that of AstraZeneca (1997–2000). He was the founding director of three biotechnology companies. According to the Roche Finance report of 2011 Bell was paid €322 450 in 2011 for his non-executive director role Controversially he has failed to use his role in Roche to make available the results of unpublished studies on Tamiflu to researchers. This has led some to ask "What do Roche and its shareholders expect for this level of involvement and remuneration?" His charity positions include chairing the board of trustees of the Oxford Health Alliance and the science committee of the UK Biobank. Bell's research has identified genes involved in susceptibility to diabetes mellitus type 1 and rheumatoid arthritis. His work has been important in elucidating the interactions on the surface of the T cell involved in immune activation. He has also worked on the biomedical applications of high-throughput genomic technologies, including structural genomics and ENU mutagenesis. Bell was awarded an honorary D.Sc. by the University of Alberta in 2003. He was President of the Academy of Medical Sciences from 2006-2011. In 2008, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and was knighted for services to medicine in the New Year Honours of that year. {{Persondata | NAME = Bell, John Irving | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION =| DATE OF BIRTH = 1 July 1952 | PLACE OF BIRTH =| DATE OF DEATH =| PLACE OF DEATH =}}
