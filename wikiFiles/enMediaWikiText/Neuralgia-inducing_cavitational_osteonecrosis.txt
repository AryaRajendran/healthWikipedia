 Neuralgia-inducing cavitational osteonecrosis (NICO) refers to presence of cavitations in jaw bones (mandible and/or maxilla) in conjunction with chronic facial neuralgia. The concept implies direct and causal relationship between the bone pathology (cavitations) and pain itself. Pain in this setting is commonly described as atypical facial neuralgia and is chronic in nature. Cavitations represent areas of necrotic (dead) bone. The cause of NICO is allegedly avascular osteonecrosis (AO) (also known as ischemic osteonecrosis). This bone ischemia would result from a chronic low-grade infection, or, in more modern versions of the theory, susceptibility to thrombosis. The suggested treatment for NICO involves oral surgery consisting of decortication and debridement of bone via curettage to remove dead bone tissue. In 1996, the Research and Scientific Affairs Committee of the American Association of Endodontists prepared the following statement to address issues raised by some endodontic patients: NICO remains a controversial diagnostic entity. The opponents argue that the concept can currently not be accepted because precise diagnostic criteria are lacking and there is no supporting scientific evidence that does not suffer from methodological flaws. It has been rejected as quackery by some but not all dentists and maxillofacial surgeons.
