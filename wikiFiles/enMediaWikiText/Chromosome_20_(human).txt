 Chromosome 20 is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 20 spans around 63 million base pairs (the building material of DNA) and represents between 2 and 2.5 percent of the total DNA in cells. Chromosome 20 was fully sequenced in 2001 and contained 59,187,298 base pairs representing 99.4% of the euchromatic DNA. Identifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 20 contains over 900 genes. New discoveries have recently linked this chromosome to the increasing susceptibility to male-pattern baldness. The following are some of the genes located on chromosome 20: The following diseases are some of those related to genes on chromosome 20:
