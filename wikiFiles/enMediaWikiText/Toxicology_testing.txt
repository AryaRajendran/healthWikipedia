 Toxicology testing, also known as safety testing, or toxicity testing, is conducted to determine the degree to which a substance can damage a living or non-living organisms. It is often conducted by researchers to comply with governing regulations. Some toxicology testing is chemical testing while some others use animals in the laboratory studies. Contract animal testing facilities such as Huntingdon Life Sciences and Inveresk Research International conduct a variety of tests on behalf of customers, including the manufacturer of medicines and household products. Around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests. In the UK, one-fifth of animal experiments are toxicology tests. The tests are conducted without anesthesia, since drugs can change test results. The tests examine finished products such as pesticides, medications, food additives such as artificial sweeteners, packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients. The substances are applied to the skin or eyes; injected intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or placing them in the animals' food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal. At one time, Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories conducted more than one-third of toxicology testing in the United States. In the United States, toxicology tests are subject to Good Laboratory Practice guidelines and other Food and Drug Administration laws.
