The first unit of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps began in 1937, when Professor Conor O'Malley, a Galway Doctor was asked by the Marquis McSweeney, the then Chancellor of the Irish Association to recruit members to form an Ambulance Corps, aimed initially for Connaught only. Thirteen men were recruited by Professor O'Malley: six sixth year students from St. Josephs College "the Bish", Secondary School; four members from C.Y.M.S., Galway ; two Scout Masters; and one "lay" member. These thirteen members were the founder members of the ambulance corps in Galway . The new recruits were enrolled on a series of First Aid lectures, given by Professor O'Malley in the X-Ray Department of the Central Hospital . The bandaging was taught by Theatre Sister Mary Shaughnessy. Examinations in First Aid were held in January1938, and all were successful. In February 1938 First Aid services were requested for a National League match in Castlebar. The duties were allocated in Alphabetical Order- "Burke" and "Coogan" were first on duty. The first Officer in Charge of the Galway Unit was Sgt. Timothy Murphy. A second unit was set up in 1939 in Kilkenny. Since then the Corps has grown in strength providing first aid cover for many major sporting and cultural events and concerts. Today, the ambulance corps is committed to providing services in a Christian, caring and non-discriminatory environment, to "Our Lords, the poor and the sick".
