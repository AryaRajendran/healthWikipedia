 Stomatology is the branch of medicine and dentistry relating to the mouth and mouth disease. It was practiced by physicians as a medical specialty in the early 20th century in the United States but these concerns are now largely handled by dentists. The specialty is defined within Europe under Directive 2001/19/EC. In Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account, concentration camp survivor Dr. Miklós Nyiszli (who served on Dr. Josef Mengele's medical kommando) describes the "tooth-pulling kommando". These teams of eight, all "fine stomatologists and dental surgeons" equipped "in one hand with a lever, and in the other a pair of pliers for extracting teeth", worked in the crematoria. Stationed in front of the ovens, their job was to pry open the mouths of prisoners who had been gassed and extract, or break off, "all gold teeth, as well as any gold bridgework and fillings". be-x-old:Стаматалёгія
