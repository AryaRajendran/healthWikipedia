 Nasal septal abscess is a condition of the nasal septum in which there is a collection of pus between the mucoperichondrium and septal cartilage. A nasal septal abscess is frequently a result of a secondary bacterial infection of a nasal septal hematoma. Individuals with this condition may also have fever, general malaise and nasal pain, including enderness over the dorsum of the nose. A bilateral persistant nasal obstruction may also be present. Potential complications of a nasal septal abscess include cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis, septal perforation, or saddle deformity due to cartilage necrosis. Treatment for a nasal septal abscess is similar to that of other bacterial infections. Aggressive broad spectrum antibiotics may be used after the infected area has been drained of fluids.
