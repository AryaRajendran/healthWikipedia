 A Rathke's cleft cyst is a benign growth found on the pituitary gland in the brain, specifically a fluid-filled cyst in the posterior portion of the anterior pituitary gland. It occurs when the Rathke's pouch does not develop properly, and ranges in size from 2 to 40mm in diameter. Asymptomatic cysts are common, detected during autopsies of 2 to 26 percent of individuals who have died of unrelated causes. Females are twice as likely as males to have a cyst. Symptomatic cysts can trigger visual disturbances, pituitary dysfunction and headaches. Close to half of symptomatic individuals have a visual disturbance, with less common symptoms including diabetes insipidus, amenorrhoea, and galactorrhea. The treatment of choice for symptomatic cysts is drainage and taking a biopsy. Radical excision is more dangerous, because it damages surrounding brain structures, and can cause more bleeding. The first Rathke's cleft cyst recognized was found during an autopsy in 1913.
