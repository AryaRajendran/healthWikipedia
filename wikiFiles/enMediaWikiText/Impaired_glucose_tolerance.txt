 Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a pre-diabetic state of hyperglycemia that is associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of cardiovascular pathology. IGT may precede type 2 diabetes mellitus by many years. IGT is also a risk factor for mortality. According to the criteria of the World Health Organization and the American Diabetes Association, impaired glucose tolerance is defined as: From 10 to 15 percent of adults in the United States have impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose. The risk of progression to diabetes and development of cardiovascular disease is greater than for impaired fasting glucose. Although some drugs can delay the onset of diabetes, lifestyle modifications play a greater role in the prevention of diabetes. Patients identified as having an IGT should exercise regularly, lose 5 to 7 percent of body weight, and limit intake of (at least) sugar and highly processed carbohydrates.America is known to have a higher percentage of diabetes due to the average intake of sugar and high carbohydrate food consumed by the general population.
