 John Ira Hochman (born 1946) is an American forensic psychiatrist and surgeon who has written about the psychology of "cults", abuse and false memory syndrome. Hochman has been practicing medicine since 1970. Hochman is Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, UCLA. He has testified in over 100 depositions, and 90 trials and arbitration since 1980. Hochman analyzed Mark Fuhrman, one of the detectives involved in the O. J. Simpson murder case. He was hired by the Los Angeles Police Department to interview Fuhrman in 1981, and the defense later filed his report in the Simpson case. Hochman had concluded that Fuhrman may have been trying to exaggerate his problems in order to qualify for a disability pension. Hochman was also consulted during a 2004 lawsuit involving Michael Jackson, and assisted the defense during the case. In a different case in 2006, Hochman examined Heather Tallchief, an armored car thief, and determined that she had been subjected to undue influence from Roberto Solis, after Tallchief claimed she had been brainwashed. Hochman has been quoted in the media as an expert on cults. When asked why there is a prevalence of cults in California, he responded: "If you're going have a cult you might as well come where the weather's nice." After a mass suicide incident, Hochman was interviewed by CNN on the inherent characteristics of a cult leader. {{Persondata | NAME =Hochman, John | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION =| DATE OF BIRTH = 1946| PLACE OF BIRTH =United States | DATE OF DEATH =| PLACE OF DEATH =}}
