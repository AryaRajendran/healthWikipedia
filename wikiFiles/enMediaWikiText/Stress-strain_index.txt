 The stress–strain index (SSI), of a bone, is a surrogate measure of bone strength determined from a cross-sectional scan by QCT or pQCT (radiological scan). The stress–strain index is used to compare the structural parameters determined by analysis of QCT/pQCT cross-sectional scans to the results of three point bending test. It is calculated using the following formula: <math>SSI = \sum_{i=0}^n {{r_i^2 a ({{CD} \over {ND}})} \over {r_{max}}}</math> Where: It was developed by the manufacturer of a peripheral quantitative CT (pQCT) scanner, and is considered to be by some an improvement over the information provided by calculating the area moments of inertia and polar moments of inertia.
