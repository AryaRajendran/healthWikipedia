Speaking in an interview with Frontier Psychiatrist, Iain McGilchrist, author of The Master and His Emissary, a book about the world views of the two hemispheres of the brain, stated: "What I began to see – and it was John Cutting's work on the right hemisphere that set me thinking – was that the difference lay not in what they do, but how they do it." {{Persondata |NAME = Cutting, John Charles|ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Cutting, John (pen name)|SHORT DESCRIPTION = British psychiatrist, writer |DATE OF BIRTH = |PLACE OF BIRTH = Aberdeen, Scotland, UK |DATE OF DEATH = |PLACE OF DEATH = }}
