 Puppy pregnancy syndrome is a psychosomatic illness in humans brought on by mass hysteria. The syndrome is localised to remote regions of India, though it has been reported in villages throughout the country and has been reported by tens of thousands of individuals. It has been noted that it is far more prevalent in areas with little access to education. People suffering from this condition believe that shortly after being bitten by a dog, puppies are conceived within their abdomen. This is said to be especially likely if the dog is sexually excited at the time of the attack. Victims are said to bark like dogs, and have reported being able to see the puppies inside them when looking at water, or hear them growling in their abdomen. It is believed that the victims will eventually die â€“ especially men, who will give birth to their puppies through the penis. Witch doctors offer oral cures which they claim will dissolve the puppies, allowing them to pass through the digestive system and be excreted "without the knowledge of the patient". Doctors in India have tried to educate the public about the dangers of believing in this condition. Most sufferers are referred to psychiatric services, but in rare instances patients fail to take anti-rabies medication in time, thinking that they have puppy pregnancy syndrome and thus the witch doctor's medicine will cure them. This is further compounded by witch doctors stating that their medicine will fail if sufferers seek conventional treatment. Psychiatrists believe that the syndrome meets the criteria for a culture-bound disorder.
