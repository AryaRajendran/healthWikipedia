 Richard N. Ash is an American physician trained as a traditional medical internist specializing in integrative medicine, a WOR (AM) radio talk show host and author. Ash took steroid medications for two and a half years to treat his inflammatory arthritis. After consulting with scientists at the NIH and through his own personal research, he decided that his problems stemmed from over acidification in his body along with food and chemical sensitivity. At the Ash Center, he applies the same principles that helped him restore his own health by focusing on improving defensive and repair mechanisms through the use of the innovative technologies in integrative alternative medicine together with using pharmaceutical-grade vitamins and nutrients to create a state of alkalinity, overall health and well being. {{Persondata | NAME = Ash, Richard | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION =| DATE OF BIRTH =| PLACE OF BIRTH =| DATE OF DEATH =| PLACE OF DEATH =}}
