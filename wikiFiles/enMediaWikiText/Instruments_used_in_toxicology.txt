 Instruments used specially in Toxicology are as follows:__Forcetoc__ Instrument !! Uses Instruments used in Internal medicine to help treat and diagnose the toxin clinically Syringe and needles aspiration and collection of blood for chemical analysis Catheter used to collect urine for chemical analysis Enema set to passively evacuate the rectum of faeces Lumbar puncture needle used for puncturing into the spine (or cisterns or fontanelles of a new born) for cerebro-spinal fluid aspiration or for injection drugs, specially anesthetics in spinal blocks, epidurals, etc Ryle's tube or Nasogastric tube used for nasogastric suction of ingested toxins (or at times introduction of food or drugs). vide link Electrocardiography machine (ECG) to read and trace the electrical activity of the heart Blood gas analyzer used to analyze and quantify the amount of various toxic gases within blood like Carbon monoxide Electroencephalography (EEG) to read and trace the electrical activity of the brain Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) apparatus vide link Ophthalmoscope to note the intra-ocular signs or effects of toxins Endoscope to look inside the oesophagus, stomach, upper intestines, bile duct, larynx, trachea, bronchi-through the mouth Ultracentrifuge used to separate particles dispersed in a liquid according to their molecular mass and aid in recognition Electrophoresis apparatus used to detect and classify serum proteins or proteins from any other source. Also used for DNA separation. Chemical laboratory apparatus for Chemical tests Chromatography: One of the basic modern "chemical examination" of body fluids and viscera •Gas Chromatography or Gas Liquid Chromatography(GLC) -do- •Planar Chromatography -do- •Paper Chromatography -do- •Thin layer chromatography -do- •Affinity chromatography -do- •Ion exchange chromatography -do- •Size exclusion chromatography -do- •Countercurrent chromatography -do- •Countercurrent chromatography -do- Setup for Radioimmunoassay or RIA previously it was widely used to detect various things in bold fluids like proteins (natural, infective, those produced by the body in reaction to disease, cancer related), tumor markers, hormones, viruses (hepatitis, HIV, etc), etc. Setup for Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) presently it is widely used to detect various things in bold fluids like proteins (natural, infective, those produced by the body in reaction to disease, cancer related), tumor markers, hormones, viruses (hepatitis, HIV, etc), etc. It has replaced RIA
