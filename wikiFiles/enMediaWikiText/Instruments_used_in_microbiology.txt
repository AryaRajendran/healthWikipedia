 Instruments used specially in microbiology are as follows: __Forcetoc__ autoclave used for sterilization of glass ware and media {| class="wikitable"|-! Instrument !! Uses|-| Incubator || used for bacterial or fungal cultures|-| brittany || a process of sterilization from spore-bearing bacteria|-| Vaccine bath || used to heat vaccine containing medium gently (to around 45-55 degrees Celsius) during vaccine production|-| Thermal cycler || used to amplify segments of DNA via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process.|-| Inoculation loop: || used to inoculate test samples into culture media for bacterial or fungal cultures, antibiograms, etc.|-| •Nichrome wire loop || used to inoculate test samples into culture media for bacterial or fungal cultures, antibiograms, etc.; reheated by flaming to red hot before use|-| •Platinum wire loop || used to inoculate test samples into culture media for bacterial or fungal cultures, antibiograms, etc.; reheated by flaming to red hot before use|-| •Sterile loops || used to inoculate test samples into culture media for bacterial or fungal cultures, antibiograms, etc.; not heated before use—these are disposable presteriliised|-| Petri dish/agar plate || to act as a supporting container to hold the culture medium in|-| McIntosh and Filde's anaerobic jar || production of anaerobic conditions for organisms that die in the presence of even little oxygen (anaerobiosis), e.g. tetanus bacteria|-| Gas-pak || releases gases to remove oxygen from a closed container, usually for anaerobiosis|-| Vacuum pump || to draw out the air from any closed chamber before pumping back CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> or N<sub>2</sub>, usually for anaerobiosis|-| Durham's tube || used to detect gas production in sugar fermentation media; the tube is placed in an inverted fashion so that gases produces get trapped in it and do not float away to the surface|-| Bijou bottle || a cylindrical small glass bottle with a screw cap used as a culture medium holder|-| Blood collection bottle || to collect blood by venipuncture |-| Castaneda's medium / Castaneda's bottle || used for simultaneous solid and liquid cultures in one bottle|-| Universal container || a cylindrical small glass bottle with a screw cap used as a culture medium holder|-| Flat medical bottle or McCartney's bottle || for simultaneous solid and liquid cultures.|-|Tuberculin syringe || as a normal syringe or to perform Mantoux test|-| Desiccator || to dry things|-| Pre-sterilized disposable container || specimen collection|-| Pre-sterilized disposable syringe / auto-destruct syringes || specimen collection|-| Pre-sterilized disposable swabs / NIH swab / postnasal swab || specimen collection|-| VDRL rotator || for VDRL test|-| Serological test slides like those for ASO, VDRL, rheumatoid factor || vide links|-| Lovibond comparator || a type of a colorimeter|-| Microtitre plates || for ELISA|-| Haemagglutination plate || for viral culture detection|-| Latex agglutination tiles || for serological analysis|-| Cragie tube || see link|-| Tissue culture bottles || to grow or keep alive cells or tissue from a living organism, e.g. stem cells|-| Candle jar || historically used for anaerobiosis; a lit candle was placed in as air-tight jar such that when it went out it would be because it used up all the available oxygen|}Centrifuge toseperate suparnatent & palleteAs well as those "used in microbiological sterilization and disinfection" (see relevant section).
