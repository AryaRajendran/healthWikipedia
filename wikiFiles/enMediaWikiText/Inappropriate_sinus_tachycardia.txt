 Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia (IST) is a rare type of cardiac arrhythmia, within the category of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). IST may be caused by the sinus node itself having an abnormal structure or function, or it may be part of a problem called dysautonomia, a disturbance and/or failure of the autonomic nervous system. Research into the mechanism and etiology (cause) of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia is ongoing. The mechanism and primary etiology of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia has not been fully elucidated. An autoimmune mechanism has been suggested as several studies have detected autoantibodies that activate beta adrenoreceptors in a portion of patients. The mechanism of the arrhythmia primarily involves the sinus node and peri-nodal tissue and does not require the AV node for maintenance. Treatments in the form of pharmacological therapy or catheter ablation are available, although it is currently difficult to treat successfully. Symptoms reported by patients vary in frequency and severity. Symptoms associated with IST include: No formal diagnostic criteria exist. A diagnosis of Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is primarily one of exclusion and the following may be observed: IST has been treated both pharmacologically and invasively, with varying degrees of success. Some types of medication tried by cardiologists and other physicians include: beta blockers, selective sinus node If channel inhibitors (ivabradine), calcium channel blockers and antiarrhythmic agents. Some SSRI drugs are also occasionally tried and also treatments more commonly used to treat postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome such as fludrocortisone. This approach is very much "trial-and-error". Patients with IST are often intolerant to beta blockers. A new selective sinus node inhibitor ivabradine is also being used to treat IST. Invasive treatments include forms of catheter ablation such as sinus node modification (selective ablation of the sinus node), complete sinus node ablation (with associated implantation of a permanent artificial pacemaker) and AV node ablation in very resistant cases (creation of iatrogenic complete heart block, necessitating implantation of a permanent artificial pacemaker).
