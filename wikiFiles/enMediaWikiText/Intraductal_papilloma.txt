 Intraductal papillomas of the breast are relatively common lesions with an incidence of approximately 2-3% in humans. They are the most common cause of bloody nipple discharge in women age 20-40 and generally do not show up on mammography due to their small size, so the next step in treatment would be a galactogram to guide the subsequent biopsy. The masses are often too small to be palpated or felt. A galactogram is therefore necessary to rule out the lesion. Excision is sometimes performed.
