 XPB (Xeroderma Pigmentosum B) is an ATP dependent human DNA helicase that is a part of the TFIIH transcription factor complex. The 3D structure of the archeael homologue of XPB has been solved by X-ray crystallography by Dr. John Tainer and his group at The Scripps Research Institute. XPB plays a significant role in normal basal transcription, transcription coupled repair (TCR), and nucleotide excision repair (NER). Purified XPB has been shown to unwind DNA with 3’-5’polarity. Mutations in XPB and other related complementation groups, XPA-XPG, leads to a number of genetic disorders such as Xeroderma Pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, and Trichothiodystrophy. XPB has been shown to interact with XPC, BCR gene, ERCC2, P53, GTF2H2, GTF2H1, GTF2H5, Cyclin-dependent kinase 7, PSMC5 and GTF2H4.
