 The goblet cell carcinoid, abbreviated GCC and also known as crypt cell carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumour with goblet cell differentiation, is a rare biphasic gastrointestinal tract tumour that consists of a neuroendocrine component and a conventional carcinoma. GCCs may present as appendicitis. .]]GCCs are diagnosed by pathology. They have a characteristic biphasic appearance which includes (1) goblet cell-like cells, and (2) neuroendocrine-type nuclear chromatin (stippled chromatin). GCCs have an aggressive course vis-a-vis other appendiceal neuroendocrine tumours. GCCs are treated with surgery.
