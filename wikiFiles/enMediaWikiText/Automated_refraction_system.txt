 An automated refraction system is a group of ophthalmic devices used during an eye examination to aid in the determination of a person's refractive error and prescription for glasses or contact lenses. The standard components of an automated refraction system are: Automated refraction systems currently on the market vary in features, level of automation, ease of use, training required and documentation. Some systems contain automatic detection and compensation of common refraction issues such as accommodation and "over-minusing". An automated refraction is quick and painless. Some advantages of automated refraction systems vs. manual refraction equipment are:
