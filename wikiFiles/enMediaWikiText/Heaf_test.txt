 The Heaf test, a diagnostic skin test, is performed to determine whether or not a child has been exposed to tuberculosis. Also known as the Sterneedle test, it is administered by a Heaf gun (trademarked "Sterneedle") which is a spring-loaded instrument with six needles arranged in a circular formation. Patients who exhibit a negative reaction to the test may be offered BCG vaccination. The test is named after F. R. G. Heaf. Until 2005, the test was used in the United Kingdom to determine if the BCG vaccine was needed; the Mantoux test is now used instead. The Heaf test was preferred in the UK, because the Heaf test was thought to be easier to interpret, with less variability between observers, and less training was required to administer and read the test. The test was withdrawn because manufacturers could not be found for tuberculin or Heaf guns. The Heaf test is used to test for tuberculosis in adolescents aged around 13â€“14. A Heaf gun is used to inject multiple samples of testing serum under the skin at once. The needle points are dipped in tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) and pricked into the skin.A Heaf gun with disposable single-use heads is recommended. The gun injects PPD equivalent to 100,000 units per ml to the skin over the flexor surface of the left forearm in a circular pattern of six. The test is read between two and seven days later. The injection must not be into sites containing superficial veins. The reading of the Heaf test is defined by a scale: Grades 1 and 2 may be the result of previous BCG or avian tuberculosis. Children who have a grade 3 or 4 reaction require X-ray and follow-up. For interpretation of the test, see Tuberculosis diagnosis. The equivalent Mantoux test positive levels done with 10 TU (0.1 mL 100 TU/mL, 1:1000) are The Mantoux test is preferred in the United States for the diagnosis of tuberculosis; multiple puncture tests, such as the Heaf test and Tine test, are not recommended.
