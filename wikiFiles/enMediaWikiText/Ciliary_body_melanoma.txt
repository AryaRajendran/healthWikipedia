 Ciliary Body Melanoma is a type of cancer arising from the coloured part (uvea) of the eye. About 12% of uveal melanoma arise from the ciliary body. It occurs most commonly in the sixth decade. The tumour is usually diagnosed by clinical examination with a slit-lamp utilising a triple mirror contact lens. Ultrasonography and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) are also sometimes helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Enucleation (surgical removal of the eye) is the treatment of choice for large ciliary body melanomas. Small or medium sized tumors may be treated by an iridocyclectomy. Radiotherapy may be appropriate in selected cases.
