 In nephrology, vascular access steal syndrome or Dialysis-associated Steal Syndrome (DASS), also known less precisely as steal syndrome, refers to vascular insufficiency resulting from an arteriovenous fistula or synthetic vascular graft-AV fistula). DASS occurs in about 1% of AV fistulas and 2.7-8% of PTFE grafts. The fistula flow can be restricted through banding, or modulated through surgical revision. If the above methods fail, the fistula is ligated, and a new fistula is created in a more proximal location in the same limb, or in the contralateral limb.
