 The mylohyoid muscle is a muscle running from the mandible to the hyoid bone, forming the floor of the oral cavity. It is named for its two attachments, with the prefix "mylo" coming from the Greek word for "molar". These muscles are mesodermal in origin. The mylohyoid muscle is derived from the first pharyngeal arch. The mylohyoid muscle is flat and triangular, and is situated immediately above the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. It forms, with its fellow of the opposite side, a muscular floor for the cavity of the mouth. Each submandibular gland is divided into superficial and deep lobes, which are separated by the mylohyoid muscle. It arises from the whole length of the mylohyoid line of the mandible, extending from the symphysis in front to the last molar tooth behind. The posterior fibers pass inferomedially to insert into the body of the hyoid bone. It thus belongs to the suprahyoid muscles. The middle and anterior fibers are inserted into a median fibrous raphé extending from the symphysis menti to the hyoid bone, where they joint at an angle with the fibers of the opposite muscle. This median raphé is sometimes absent; the fibers of the two muscles are then continuous. Along with the anterior belly of the digastric muscle, the mylohyoid muscle is innervated by the mylohyoid nerve, a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve, which is a branch of the mandibular nerve V3, a division of the trigeminal nerve also known as cranial nerve V. The mylohyoid depresses the mandible and elevates the hyoid, the floor of the oral cavity, and the tongue. This is particularly important during swallowing and speaking. It may be united to or replaced by the anterior belly of the digastric muscle; accessory slips to other hyoid muscles are frequent.
