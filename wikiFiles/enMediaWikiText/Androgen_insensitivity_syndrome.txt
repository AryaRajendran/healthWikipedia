 Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition that results in the partial or complete inability of the cell to respond to androgens. The unresponsiveness of the cell to the presence of androgenic hormones can impair or prevent the masculinization of male genitalia in the developing fetus, as well as the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty, but does not significantly impair female genital or sexual development. As such, the insensitivity to androgens is clinically significant only when it occurs in genetic males (i.e. individuals with a Y-chromosome, or more specifically, an SRY gene). Clinical phenotypes in these individuals range from a normal male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect or reduced secondary terminal hair, to a full female habitus, despite the presence of a Y-chromosome. AIS is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal female; mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal male, and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are partially, but not fully, masculinized. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is the largest single entity that leads to 46,XY undermasculinized genitalia. AIS is broken down into three classes based on phenotype: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), and mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS). A supplemental system of phenotypic grading that uses seven classes instead of the traditional three was proposed by pediatric endocrinologist Charmian A. Quigley et al. in 1995. The first six grades of the scale, grades 1 through 6, are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization; grade 1 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully masculinized, grade 6 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully feminized, and grades 2 through 5 quantify four degrees of decreasingly masculinized genitalia that lie in the interim. Grade 7 is indistinguishable from grade 6 until puberty, and is thereafter differentiated by the presence of secondary terminal hair; grade 6 is indicated when secondary terminal hair is present, whereas grade 7 is indicated when it is absent. The Quigley scale can be used in conjunction with the traditional three classes of AIS to provide additional information regarding the degree of genital masculinization, and is particularly useful when the diagnosis is PAIS. The human androgen receptor (AR) is a protein encoded by a gene located on the proximal long arm of the X chromosome (locus Xq11-Xq12). The protein coding region consists of approximately 2,757 nucleotides (919 codons) spanning eight exons, designated 1-8 or A-H. Introns vary in size between 0.7 and 26 kb. Like other nuclear receptors, the androgen receptor protein consists of several functional domains: the transactivation domain (also called the transcription-regulation domain or the amino / NH2-terminal domain), the DNA-binding domain, the hinge region, and the steroid-binding domain (also called the carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain).<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" /> The transactivation domain is encoded by exon 1, and makes up more than half of the AR protein.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> Exons 2 and 3 encode the DNA-binding domain, while the 5' portion of exon 4 encodes the hinge region.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> The remainder of exon 4 through exon 8 encodes the ligand binding domain.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> The androgen receptor gene contains two polymorphic trinucleotide microsatellites in exon 1.<ref name="2008 galani 7" /> The first microsatellite (nearest the 5' end) contains 8 <ref name="1999 kooy 85" /> to 60 <ref name="2002 dejager 87" /><ref name="1998 choong 21" /> repetitions of the glutamine codon "CAG" and is thus known as the polyglutamine tract.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> The second microsatellite contains 4 <ref name="2010 audi 95" /> to 31 <ref name="1997 lumbroso 101" /> repetitions of the glycine codon "GGC" and is known as the polyglycine tract.<ref name="1999 gottlieb 89" /> The average number of repetitions varies by ethnicity, with Caucasians exhibiting an average of 21 CAG repeats, and Blacks 18.<ref name="1992 edwards 12" /> In men, disease states are associated with extremes in polyglutamine tract length; prostate cancer,<ref name="2001 casella 58" /> hepatocellular carcinoma,<ref name="2007 yeh 120" /> and mental retardation <ref name="1999 kooy 85" /> are associated with too few repetitions, while spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is associated with a CAG repetition length of 40 or more.<ref name="1991 la spada 352" /> Some studies indicate that the length of the polyglutamine tract is inversely correlated with transcriptional activity in the AR protein, and that longer polyglutamine tracts may be associated with male infertility <ref name="2003 casella 169" /><ref name="1999 dowsing 354" /><ref name="1997 tut 82" /> and undermasculinized genitalia in men.<ref name="2000 lim 9" /> However, other studies have indicated that no such correlation exists.<ref name="2000 hiort 85" /><ref name="2002 kukuvitis 25" /><ref name="2001 von eckardstein 86" /><ref name="2002 rajpert-de meyts 359" /><ref name="1999 hiort 354" /><ref name="2001 muroya 7" /> A comprehensive meta-analysis of the subject published in 2007 supports the existence of the correlation, and concluded that these discrepancies could be resolved when sample size and study design are taken into account.<ref name="2007 davis-dao 92" /> Some studies suggest that longer polyglycine tract lengths are also associated with genital masculinization defects in men.<ref name="2007 radpour 28" /><ref name="2004 aschim 89" /> Other studies find no such association.<ref name="2006 rajender 27" /> As of 2010, over 400 AR mutations have been reported in the AR mutation database, and the number continues to grow.<ref name="2008 galani 7" /> Inheritance is typically maternal and follows an X-linked recessive pattern;<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2001 gottlieb 17" /> individuals with a 46,XY karyotype will always express the mutant gene since they only have one X chromosome, whereas 46,XX carriers will be minimally affected. 30% of the time, the AR mutation is a spontaneous result, and is not inherited.<ref name="2010 ozulker 24" /> Such de novo mutations are the result of a germ cell mutation or germ cell mosaicism in the gonads of one of the parents, or a mutation in the fertilized egg itself.<ref name="2005 kohler 90" /> In one study,<ref name="1998 hiort 132" /> it was found that 3 out of 8 de novo mutations occurred in the post-zygotic stage, leading to the estimate that up to one third of de novo mutations result in somatic mosaicism.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> It is worthwhile to note that not every mutation of the AR gene results in androgen insensitivity; one particular mutation occurs in 8 to 14 percent of genetic males,<ref name="1992 batch 1" /><ref name="1994 hiort 153" /><ref name="1996 lu 49" /><ref name="1993 macke 53" /> and is thought to adversely affect only a small number of individuals when other genetic factors are present.<ref name="1999 gottlieb 14" /> Some individuals with CAIS or PAIS do not have any AR mutations despite clinical, hormonal, and histological features sufficient to warrant an AIS diagnosis; up to 5% of women with CAIS do not have an AR mutation,<ref name="2008 galani 7" /> as well as between 27% <ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2003 melo 88" /> and 72% <ref name="2000 ahmed 85" /> of individuals with PAIS. In one patient, it was shown that the underlying cause for presumptive PAIS was a mutant steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) protein.<ref name="2007 coutant 92" /> In another patient, it was shown that CAIS was the result of a deficit in the transmission of a transactivating signal from the N-terminal region of the normal androgen receptor to the basal transcription machinery of the cell.<ref name="2000 adachi 343" /> It was suggested that a coactivator protein interacting with the activation function 1 (AF-1) transactivation domain of the androgen receptor was deficient in this patient.<ref name="2000 adachi 343" /> The signal disruption could not be corrected by supplementation with any coactivators known at the time, nor was the absent coactivator protein characterized, which left some in the field unconvinced that a mutant coactivator would explain the mechanism of androgen resistance in CAIS or PAIS patients with a normal AR gene.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> Depending on the mutation, a person with a (46,XY karyotype) and AIS can have either a male (MAIS) or female (CAIS) phenotype,<ref name="1999 ghadessy 103" /> or may have genitalia that is only partially masculinized (PAIS).<ref name="2003 giwercman 61" /> The gonads are testes regardless of phenotype due to the influence of the Y-chromosome.<ref name="2006 achermann" /><ref name="1995 simpson" /> A 46,XY female thus does not have ovaries or a uterus,<ref name="1996 brinkmann 61" /> and can neither contribute an egg towards conception nor gestate a child. Several case studies of fertile 46,XY males with androgen insensitivity have been published,<ref name="2002 giwercman 87" /><ref name="1989 pinsky 32" /><ref name="1988 grino 66" /><ref name="1994 tsukada 79" /><ref name="2000 giwercman 85" /> although this group is thought to be a minority.<ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" /> Additionally, some infertile males with MAIS have been able to conceive children after increasing their sperm count through the use of supplementary testosterone.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1994 yong 344" /> A genetic male conceived by a man with androgen insensitivity would not receive his father's X chromosome, and thus would neither inherit nor carry the gene for the syndrome. A genetic female conceived in such a way would receive her father's X chromosome, and would thus become a carrier. Genetic females (46,XX karyotype) have two X chromosomes, and thus have two AR genes. A mutation in one (but not both) of the AR genes results in a minimally affected, fertile, female carrier. Some carriers have been noted to have slightly reduced body hair, delayed puberty, and / or tall stature, presumably due to skewed X-inactivation.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2002 giwercman 87" /> A female carrier will pass the affected AR gene to her children 50% of the time. If the affected child is a genetic female, she too will be a carrier. An affected 46,XY child will have androgen insensitivity syndrome. A genetic female with mutations in both AR genes could theoretically result from the union of a fertile man with androgen insensitivity and a female carrier of the gene, or from de novo mutation. However, given the scarcity of fertile androgen insensitive men and low incidence of AR mutation, the chances of this occurrence is small. The phenotype of such an individual is a matter of speculation; as of 2010, no such documented case has been published. Individuals with partial androgen insensitivity, unlike those with the complete or mild forms, present at birth with ambiguous genitalia, and the decision to raise the child as male or female is often not obvious.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2005 kohler 90" /><ref name="2006 bouvattier 91" /> Unfortunately, it is often the case that little information regarding phenotype can be gleaned from precise knowledge of the AR mutation itself; it is well established that the same AR mutation may cause significant variation in the degree of masculinization in different individuals, even among members of the same family.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2001 gottlieb 17" /><ref name="2003 giwercman 61" /><ref name="2001 boehmer 86" /><ref name="1997 evans 76" /><ref name="1987 perez-palacios 27" /><ref name="1997 radmayr 158" /><ref name="2005 deeb 63" /><ref name="1996 rodien 81" /><ref name="1998 nordenskjold 11" /> Exactly what causes this variation is not entirely understood, although factors contributing to it could include the lengths of the polyglutamine and polyglycine tracts,<ref name="2006 werner 91" /> sensitivity to and variations in the intrauterine endocrine milieu,<ref name="2003 giwercman 61" /> the effect of coregulatory proteins that are active in Sertoli cells,<ref name="1999 gottlieb 89" /><ref name="2002 zenteno 57" /> somatic mosaicism,<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> expression of the 5RD2 gene in genital skin fibroblasts,<ref name="2001 boehmer 86" /> reduced AR transcription and translation from factors other than mutations in the AR coding region,<ref name="2005 holterhus 83" /> an unidentified coactivator protein,<ref name="2000 adachi 343" /> enzyme deficiencies such as 21-hydroxylase deficiency,<ref name="2002 giwercman 87" /> or other genetic variations such as a mutant steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) protein.<ref name="2007 coutant 92" /> The degree of variation, however, does not appear to be constant across all AR mutations, and is much more extreme in some.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2002 giwercman 87" /><ref name="1999 gottlieb 14" /><ref name="2003 giwercman 61" /> Missense mutations that result in a single amino acid substitution are known to produce the most phenotypic diversity.<ref name="2008 galani 7" /> The effects that androgens have on the human body --- virilization, masculinization, anabolism, etc. --- are not brought about by androgens themselves, but rather are the result of androgens bound to androgen receptors; the androgen receptor mediates the effects of androgens in the human body.<ref name="1998 wang 83" /> Likewise, under normal circumstances, the androgen receptor itself is inactive in the cell until androgen binding occurs.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> The following series of steps illustrates how androgens and the androgen receptor work together to produce androgenic effects:<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" /><ref name="1998 choong 21" /><ref name="2005 taneja 280" /><ref name="2002 heinlein 23" /> <ol style="list-style-type:decimal"> </ol> In this way, androgens bound to androgen receptors regulate the expression of target genes, and thus produce androgenic effects. It is theoretically possible for certain mutant androgen receptors to function without androgens; in vitro studies have demonstrated that a mutant androgen receptor protein can induce transcription in the absence of androgen if its steroid binding domain is deleted.<ref name="1991 jenster 5" /><ref name="1991 simental 266" /> Conversely, the steroid-binding domain may act to repress the AR transactivation domain, perhaps due to the AR's unliganded conformation.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> Human embryos develop similarly for the first six weeks, regardless of genetic sex (46,XX or 46,XY karyotype); the only way to tell the difference between 46,XX or 46,XY embryos during this time period is to look for Barr bodies or a Y-chromosome.<ref name="2006 jones" /> The gonads begin as bulges of tissue called the genital ridges at the back of the abdominal cavity, near the midline. By the fifth week, the genital ridges differentiate into an outer cortex and an inner medulla, and are called indifferent gonads.<ref name="2006 jones" /> By the sixth week, the indifferent gonads begin to differentiate according to genetic sex. If the karyotype is 46,XY, testes develop due to the influence of the Y chromosome’s SRY gene.<ref name="2006 achermann" /><ref name="1995 simpson" /> This process does not require the presence of androgen, nor a functional androgen receptor.<ref name="2006 achermann" /><ref name="1995 simpson" /> Until approximately the seventh week of development, the embryo has indifferent sex accessory ducts, which consist of two pairs of ducts: the Müllerian ducts and the Wolffian ducts.<ref name="2006 jones" /> The testes secrete anti-Müllerian hormone around this time to suppress the development of the Müllerian ducts, and cause their degeneration.<ref name="2006 jones" /> Without this anti-Müllerian hormone, the Müllerian ducts develop into the female internal genitalia (uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and upper vaginal barrel).<ref name="2006 jones" /> Unlike the Müllerian ducts, the Wolffian ducts will not continue to develop by default.<ref name="2003 yong 9" /> In the presence of testosterone and functional androgen receptors, the Wolffian ducts develop into the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles.<ref name="2006 jones" /> If the testes fail to secrete testosterone, or the androgen receptors do not function properly, the Wolffian ducts degenerate.<ref name="2004 hannema 89" /> Masculinization of the external genitalia (the penis, penile urethra, and scrotum), as well as the prostate, are dependent on the androgen dihydrotestosterone.<ref name="2008 oakes 21" /><ref name="1999 roy 55" /><ref name="1999 kokontis 55" /><ref name="2009 rajender 91" /> Testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme.<ref name="2006 sobel 91" /> If this enzyme is absent or deficient, then dihydrotestosterone will not be created, and the external male genitalia will not develop properly.<ref name="2008 oakes 21" /><ref name="1999 roy 55" /><ref name="1999 kokontis 55" /><ref name="2009 rajender 91" /><ref name="2006 sobel 91" /> As is the case with the internal male genitalia, a functional androgen receptor is needed in order for dihydrotestosterone to regulate the transcription of target genes involved in development.<ref name="1998 wang 83" /> Mutations in the androgen receptor gene can cause problems with any of the steps involved in androgenization, from the synthesis of the androgen receptor protein itself, through the transcriptional ability of the dimerized, androgen-AR complex.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> AIS can result if even one of these steps is significantly disrupted, as each step is required in order for androgens to successfully activate the AR and regulate gene expression.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> Exactly which steps a particular mutation will impair can be predicted, to some extent, by identifying the area of the AR in which the mutation resides. This predictive ability is primarily retrospective in origin; the different functional domains of the AR gene have been elucidated by analyzing the effects of specific mutations in different regions of the AR.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> For example, mutations in the steroid binding domain have been known to affect androgen binding affinity or retention, mutations in the hinge region have been known to affect nuclear translocation, mutations in the DNA-binding domain have been known to affect dimerization and binding to target DNA, and mutations in the transactivation domain have been known to affect target gene transcription regulation.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="2003 yong 9" /> Unfortunately, even when the affected functional domain is known, it is difficult to predict the phenotypical consequences of a particular mutation (see Correlation of genotype and phenotype). Some mutations can adversely impact more than one functional domain. For example, a mutation in one functional domain can have deleterious effects on another by altering the way in which the domains interact.<ref name="2003 yong 9" /> A single mutation can affect all downstream functional domains if a premature stop codon or framing error results; such a mutation can result in a completely unusable (or unsynthesizable) androgen receptor protein.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> The steroid binding domain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of a premature stop codon or framing error, since it occurs at the end of the gene, and its information is thus more likely to be truncated or misinterpreted than other functional domains.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> Other, more complex relationships have been observed as a consequence of mutated AR; some mutations associated with male phenotypes have been linked to male breast cancer, prostate cancer, or in the case of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, disease of the central nervous system.<ref name="2003 lund 79" /><ref name="2001 casella 58" /><ref name="1992 wooster 2" /><ref name="1996 evans 28" /><ref name="1993 lobaccaro 2" /> The form of breast cancer that is seen in some men with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome is caused by a mutation in the AR's DNA-binding domain.<ref name="1992 wooster 2" /><ref name="1993 lobaccaro 2" /> It has been hypothesized that this mutation causes a disturbance of the AR's target gene interaction that allows it to act at certain additional targets, possibly in conjunction with the estrogen receptor protein, to cause cancerous growth.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> The etiology of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) demonstrates that even the mutant AR protein itself can result in pathology. The trinucleotide repeat expansion of the polyglutamine tract of the AR gene that is associated with SBMA results in the synthesis of a misfolded AR protein that the cell fails to properly proteolyze and disperse.<ref name="1999 stenoien 8" /> These misfolded AR proteins form aggregates in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus.<ref name="1999 stenoien 8" /> Over the course of 30 to 50 years, these aggregates accumulate and have a cytotoxic effect, eventually resulting in the neurodegenerative symptoms associated with SBMA.<ref name="1999 stenoien 8" /> The phenotypes that result from the insensitivity to androgens are not unique to AIS, and thus the diagnosis of AIS requires thorough exclusion of other causes.<ref name="1999 ahmed 80" /><ref name="1987 perez-palacios 27" /> Clinical findings indicative of AIS include the presence of a short vagina <ref name="2007 ismail-pratt 22" /> or undermasculinized genitalia,<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1997 evans 76" /><ref name="2008 oakes 21" /> partial or complete regression of Müllerian structures,<ref name="2009 nichols 91" /> bilateral nondysplastic testes,<ref name="2006 hannema 208" /> and impaired spermatogenesis and / or virilization.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2003 lund 79" /> Laboratory findings include a 46,XY karyotype <ref name="2008 galani 7" /> and normal or elevated postpubertal testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol levels.<ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="1999 ahmed 80" /> The androgen binding activity of genital skin fibroblasts is typically diminished,<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="1996 weidemann 45" /> although exceptions have been reported.<ref name="2008 deeb 93" /> Conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone may be impaired.<ref name="1995 quigley 16" /> The diagnosis of AIS is confirmed if androgen receptor gene sequencing reveals a mutation, although not all individuals with AIS (particularly PAIS) will have an AR mutation (see Other Causes).<ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2003 melo 88" /><ref name="2000 ahmed 85" /> Each of the three types of AIS --- complete, partial, and mild --- has a different list of differential diagnoses to consider.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> Depending on the form of AIS that is suspected, the list of differentials can include:<ref name="2006 achermann" /><ref name="1995 simpson" /><ref name="2010 quint 53" /><ref name="2008 hughes 22" /><ref name="2002 kim 15" /> <ol style="list-style-type:disc"> </ol> Management of AIS is currently limited to symptomatic management; methods to correct a malfunctioning androgen receptor protein that result from an AR gene mutation are not currently available.

Estimates for the incidence of androgen insensitivity syndrome are based on a relatively small population size, and thus are known to be imprecise.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> CAIS is estimated to occur in 1 out of every 20,400 46,XY births.<ref name="2006 banksboll 71" /> A nationwide survey in The Netherlands based on patients with genetic confirmation of the diagnosis estimates that the minimal incidence of CAIS is 1 in 99,000.<ref name="2001 boehmer 86" /> The incidence of PAIS is estimated to be 1 in 130,000.<ref name="2010 mazen 73" /> Due to its subtle presentation, MAIS is not typically investigated except in the case of male infertility,<ref name="2008 oakes 21" /> and thus its true prevalence is unknown.<ref name="2008 galani 7" /> Recorded descriptions of the effects of androgen insensitivity syndrome date back for hundreds of years, although significant understanding of its underlying histopathology would not occur until the 1950s.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> The taxonomy and nomenclature associated with androgen insensitivity went through a significant evolution that paralleled this understanding. <ol style="list-style-type:disc"> </ol> The first descriptions of the effects of androgen insensitivity appeared in the medical literature as individual case reports or as part of a comprehensive description of intersex physicalities. In 1839, Scottish obstetrician Sir James Young Simpson published one such description <ref name="1839 simpson" /> in an exhaustive study of intersexuality that has been credited with advancing the medical community's understanding of the subject.<ref name="2007 king" /> Simpson's system of taxonomy, however, was far from the first; taxonomies / descriptions for the classification of intersexuality were developed by Italian physician and physicist Fortuné Affaitati in 1549,<ref name="1549 affaitati" /><ref name="1820 panckoucke 1" /> French surgeon Ambroise Paré in 1573,<ref name="2007 king" /><ref name="1573 pare" /> French physician and sexology pioneer Nicolas Venette in 1687 (under the pseudonym Vénitien Salocini),<ref name="1687 venette" /><ref name="1718 jacob" /> and French Zoologist Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire in 1832.<ref name="1832 st. hilaire" /> All five of the aforementioned authors used the colloquial term "hermaphrodite" as the foundation of their taxonomies, although Simpson himself questioned the propriety of the word in his publication.<ref name="1839 simpson" /> Use of the word "hermaphrodite" in the medical literature has persisted to this day,<ref name="2009 dorsey 73" /><ref name="2007 verkauskas 177" /> although its propriety is still in question. An alternative system of nomenclature has been recently suggested,<ref name="2006 hughes 91" /> but the subject of exactly which word or words should be used in its place still one of much debate.<ref name="2008 hughes 22" /><ref name="2007 simmonds 92" /><ref name="2010 zannoni 29" /><ref name="2008 federer 38" /><ref name="2007 reis 50" /> "Pseudohermaphroditism" has, until very recently,<ref name="2006 hughes 91" /> been the term used in the medical literature to describe the condition of an individual whose gonads and karyotype do not match the external genitalia in the gender binary sense. For example, 46,XY individuals who have a female phenotype, but also have testes instead of ovaries --- a group that includes all individuals with complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS), as well as some individuals with partial androgen insensitivity (PAIS) --- are classified as having "male pseudohermaphroditism," while individuals with both an ovary and a testis (or at least one ovotestis) are classified as having "true hermaphroditism.".<ref name="2007 verkauskas 177" /><ref name="2006 hughes 91" /> Usage of the word in the medical literature predates the discovery of the chromosome, and thus its definition has not always taken karyotype into account when determining an individual's sex. Previous definitions of "pseudohermaphroditism" relied on perceived inconsistencies between the internal and external organs; the "true" sex of an individual was determined by the internal organs, and the external organs determined the "perceived" sex of an individual.<ref name="1839 simpson" /><ref name="1832 st. hilaire" /> German-Swiss pathologist Edwin Klebs is sometimes noted for using the word "pseudohermaphroditism" in his taxonomy of intersexuality in 1876,<ref name="1876 klebs" /> although the word is clearly not his invention as is sometimes reported; the history of the word "pseudohermaphrodite," and the corresponding desire to separate "true" hermaphrodites from "false," "spurious," or "pseudo" hermaphrodites, dates back to at least 1709, when Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch used it in a publication describing a subject with testes and a mostly female phenotype.<ref name="1709 ruysch 8" /> "Pseudohermaphrodite" also appeared in the Acta Eruditorum later that same year, in a review of Ruysch's work.<ref name="1709 mencke 28" /> There is also evidence that the word was already being used by the German and French medical community long before Klebs used it; German physiologist Johannes Peter Müller equated "pseudohermaphroditism" with a sub-class of hermaphroditism from St. Hilaire's taxonomy in a publication dated 1834,<ref name="1834 muller" /> and by the 1840s "pseudo-hermaphroditism" was appearing in several French and German publications, including dictionaries.<ref name="1843 academie francaise" /><ref name="1840 ritter von raimann 22" /><ref name="1815 bertuch" /><ref name="1859 peschier" /> In 1953, American gynecologist John Morris provided the first full description of what he called "testicular feminization syndrome" based on 82 cases compiled from the medical literature, including 2 of his own patients.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1995 quigley 16" /><ref name="1953 morris 65" /> The term "testicular feminization" was coined to reflect Morris' observation that the testicles in these patients produced a hormone that had a feminizing effect on the body, a phenomenon that is now understood to be due to the inaction of androgens, and subsequent aromatization of testosterone into estrogen.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> A few years before Morris published his landmark paper, Lawson Wilkins had shown through his own experiments that unresponsiveness of the target cell to the action of androgenic hormones was a cause of "male pseudohermaphroditism".<ref name="1987 perez-palacios 27" /><ref name="1950 wilkins" /> Wilkins' work, which clearly demonstrated the lack of a therapeutic effect when 46,XY women were treated with androgens, caused a gradual shift in nomenclature from "testicular feminization" to "androgen resistance".<ref name="2008 oakes 21" /> A distinct name has been given to many of the various presentations of androgen insensitivity syndrome, such as Reifenstein syndrome (1947),<ref name="1947 reifenstein 3" /> Goldberg-Maxwell syndrome (1948),<ref name="1948 goldberg 8" /> Morris' syndrome (1953),<ref name="1953 morris 65" /> Gilbert-Dreyfus syndrome (1957),<ref name="1957 gilbert-dreyfus 18" /> Lub's syndrome (1959),<ref name="1959 lubs 19" /> "incomplete testicular feminization" (1963),<ref name="1963 morris 87" /> Rosewater syndrome (1965),<ref name="1965 rosewater 63" /> and Aiman's syndrome (1979).<ref name="1979 aiman 300" /> Since it was not understood that these different presentations were all caused by the same set of mutations in the androgen receptor gene, a unique name was given to each new combination of symptoms, resulting in a complicated stratification of seemingly disparate disorders.<ref name="1987 perez-palacios 27" /><ref name="2008 simpson" /> Over the last 60 years, as reports of strikingly different phenotypes were reported to occur even among members of the same family, and as steady progress was made towards the understanding of the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AIS, it has been demonstrated that these disorders are different phenotypic expressions of one syndrome caused by molecular defects in the androgen receptor gene.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" /><ref name="1987 perez-palacios 27" /><ref name="2008 simpson" /> Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is now the accepted terminology for the syndromes resulting from unresponsiveness of the target cell to the action of androgenic hormones.<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /> AIS is broken down into three classes based on phenotype: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), and mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS).<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2008 galani 7" /><ref name="2008 zuccarello 68" /><ref name="2006 ferlin 65" /><ref name="2009 stouffs 15" /><ref name="2010 ozulker 24" /><ref name="2007 davis-dao 92" /><ref name="2005 kawate 90" /><ref name="2005 gottlieb 10" /> CAIS encompasses the phenotypes previously described by "testicular feminization," Morris' syndrome, and Goldberg-Maxwell syndrome;<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="2004 hester 16" /> PAIS includes Reifenstein syndrome, Gilbert-Dreyfus syndrome, Lub's syndrome, "incomplete testicular feminization," and Rosewater syndrome;<ref name="2008 simpson" /><ref name="1999 mcphaul 69" /><ref name="2000 miller" /> and MAIS includes Aiman's syndrome.<ref name="2002 sultan 20" /> The more virilized phenotypes of AIS have sometimes been described as "undervirilized male syndrome," "infertile male syndrome," "undervirilized fertile male syndrome," etc., before evidence was reported that these conditions were caused by mutations in the androgen receptor gene.<ref name="1994 tsukada 79" /> These diagnoses were used to describe a variety of mild defects in virilization; as a result, the phenotypes of some men that have been diagnosed as such are better described by PAIS (e.g. micropenis, hypospadias and undescended testes), while others are better described by MAIS (e.g. isolated infertility or gynecomastia).<ref name="2006 hughes 20" /><ref name="1994 tsukada 79" /><ref name="2000 giwercman 85" /><ref name="2000 miller" /><ref name="2002 chu 87" /><ref name="1997 mesched 3" /> The 1991 novel Ring (later adopted into English "The Ring" series) describes that the central antagonist Sadako as having this syndrome. In Season 2 Episode 13 "Skin Deep" of House, the main patient's testicular cancer is mistaken for an ovary due to the patient's undiscovered AIS.
