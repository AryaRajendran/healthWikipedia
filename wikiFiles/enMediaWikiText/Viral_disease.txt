 These are tables of the clinically most important viruses. A vast number of viruses cause infectious diseases, but these are the major ones. Basic structural characteristics, such as genome type, virion shape and replication site, generally share the same features among virus species within the same family. There are currently 21 families of viruses known to cause disease in humans. There are five double stranded DNA families: three are non enveloped (Adenoviruses, Papillomavirus and Polyomavirus) and two are enveloped (Herpesvirus and Poxvirus). All the non enveloped families have icosahedral nucleocapsids. There is one family of partly double stranded DNA viruses: the Hepadnaviridae. These viruses are enveloped. There is one family of single stranded DNA viruses that infect humans: the Parvoviridae. These viruses are non enveloped. There are seven positive single stranded RNA families: three non enveloped (Astrovirus, Calicivirus and Picornavirus) and four enveloped (Coronovirus, Flavivirus, Retrovirus and Togavirus). All the non enveloped families have icosahedral nucleocapsids. There are six negative single stranded RNA families: Arenavirus, Bunyavirus, Filovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Paramyxovirus and Rhabdovirus. All are enveloped with helical nucleocapsids. There is one family with a double stranded RNA genome: the Reoviridae. There are two additional viruses (Hepatitis D and Hepatitis E) which have not yet been assigned to a family but are clearly distinct from the other families infecting humans. There is one family and one genus of viruses known to infect humans that have not been associated with disease: the family Anelloviridae and the genus Dependovirus. Both of these taxa are non enveloped single stranded DNA viruses. Among the human infecting families there are a number of rules that may assist physicians and medical microbiologists/virologists. As a rule DNA viruses replicate within the nucleus while RNA viruses replicate within the cytoplasm. Exceptions are known to this rule: poxviruses (DNA viruses) replicate within the cytoplasm and orthomyxoviruses and hepatitis D virus (RNA viruses) replicate within the nucleus. Four families have segmented genomes: Bunyavirus, Orthomyxovirus, Arenavirus and Reovirus (acronym BOAR). All are RNA viruses. Three families are transmitted almost exclusively by arthropods: Bunyavirus, Flavivirus and Togavirus. Some Reoviruses are transmitted from arthropod vectors as well. All are RNA viruses. Only one family of enveloped viruses causes gastroenteritis (Coronaviridae). All other viruses associated with gastroenteritis are non enveloped.

If this association can be confirmed it is the first known case of disease caused by a virus previously considered pathogenic only to plants. Folding@home is a distributed computing project which is researching how viruses pass through the cell membrane in the hopes of finding treatments which can prevent viral infection. The project is powered by volunteers who have donated spare CPU/GPU computing resources.
