 Gilda's Club (named in tribute to comic actress Gilda Radner, who died of ovarian cancer in 1989), is a community organization for people living with cancer, their families and friends. Local chapters provide meeting places where men, women and children living with cancer and their families and friends join with others to build emotional and social support as a supplement to medical care. Free of charge and nonprofit, Gilda's Club chapters offer support and networking groups, lectures, workshops and social events in a nonresidential, homelike setting. It is now known as the Cancer Support Community. Gilda's Club was founded by Joanna Bull, Radner's cancer psychotherapist during the time she had cancer; Radner's husband, Gene Wilder; and broadcaster Joel Siegel. Radner's story can be read in her book, It's Always Something. The organization took its former name from Radner's comment that cancer gave her "membership to an elite club I'd rather not belong to". In July 2009, Gilda’s Club Worldwide merged with The Wellness Community, another established cancer support organization to create the Cancer Support Community (CSC). As of 2012, there were over 20 active local affiliates of Gilda’s Club. Although some local affiliates of Gilda’s Club and The Wellness community have retained their names, many affiliates have adopted the name Cancer Support Community following the merger.
