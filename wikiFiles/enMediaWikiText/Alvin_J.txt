 The Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine is a cancer treatment, research and education institution with four locations in the St. Louis area. Siteman is the only cancer center in Missouri and within 240 miles of St. Louis to be designated a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Siteman is also the only area member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit alliance of 21 cancer centers dedicated to improving the quality and effectiveness of cancer care. In 2012, Siteman was named a top 10 U.S. cancer center by [[U.S. News & World Report]]. The recognition is part of the overall ranking of its parent institutions, Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University, which are No. 6 on the news magazine’s 2012 “Best Hospitals” list. Washington University School of Medicine is also ranked No. 6 on the U.S. News & World Report "Best Medical Schools" list. In 2011, Siteman treated more than 8,500 newly diagnosed cancer patients and every year provides continuing care to about 40,000 people, making it one of the largest cancer centers in the United States. Siteman’s main facility is at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis’ Central West End neighborhood. Three other St. Louis-area sites offer specialized cancer care in community hospital locations: Barnes-Jewish West County Hospital in Creve Coeur, Missouri, Barnes-Jewish St. Peters Hospital in St. Peters, Missouri and Siteman Cancer Center-South County in south St. Louis County, Missouri. In 1999, Alvin J. and Ruth Siteman committed $35 million to the development of the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. The commitment was the largest gift ever received by Barnes-Jewish and Washington University in support of cancer research, patient care and services, education and community outreach, Timothy Eberlein, M.D., has been director of the center since its inception. John DiPersio, M.D., Ph.D., is deputy director. In 2001, the NCI designated Siteman as a Cancer Center, which signaled that the institution had demonstrated significant scope and quality in its cancer research programs. The designation came with $850,000 per year in federal research grants. The NCI named Siteman a Comprehensive Cancer Center in 2005, recognizing its broad-based research, outreach and education activities, and awarded the center a five-year, $21 million support grant. The NCI renewed the designation in 2010 and awarded another five-year grant, totaling $23 million. The grants fund programs and specialized services that promote multidisciplinary research, as well as shared scientific resources and seed awards that enable investigators to develop and pursue new research opportunities. Alvin J. Siteman announced in 2010 that he would donate $1 million annually to an endowment fund at the center to advance cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment programs that might not receive federal funding. More than 350 Washington University research scientists and physicians provide inpatient and outpatient care at Siteman. The center also offers patient and family support services, including discussion and education groups. Scientists and physicians affiliated with Siteman hold more than $160 million in cancer research and related training grants. The results of basic laboratory research are rapidly incorporated into treatment advances. This process is enhanced by patient access to more than 240 therapeutic clinical studies, including many collaborative efforts with other leading cancer centers throughout the country. Researchers affiliated with Siteman and/or Washington University School of Medicine have pioneered important advances in cancer research, prevention, education and treatment.
