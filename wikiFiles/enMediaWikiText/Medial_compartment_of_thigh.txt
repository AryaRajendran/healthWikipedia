 The medial fascial compartment of thigh contains the hip adductors. The obturator nerve is the primary nerve supplying this compartment. The muscles in the compartment are: The obturator externus muscle is sometimes considered part of this group, and sometimes excluded. (Spatially, it is it in this location, but functionally, it is more similar to the other lateral rotator group muscles). The pectineus is sometimes included in this group, and sometimes excluded. (It has the same function as the others in this group, but different innervation.)
