 Alloimmunity is an immune response to foreign antigens (alloantigens) from members of the same species. The body attacks especially transplanted tissue and even the fetus in some cases. Alloimmune response results in graft rejection which is manifested as deterioration or complete loss of its function.Alloimmunity is caused by the difference between products of highly polymorphic genes, primarily genes of MHC complex, of the donor and graft recipient. These products are recognized by T-lymphocytes and other mononuclear leukocytes which infiltrate the graft and damage it. CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes along with other mononuclear leukocytes (their exact function regarding the topic is not known) participate in the rejection. B-lymphocytes, NK cells and cytokines also play a role in it. <big>B-lymphocytes</big> Humoral (antibody-mediated) type of rejection is caused by recipient’s B-lymphocytes which produce alloantibodies against donor MHC class I and II molecules. These alloantibodies can activate the complement – this leads to target cell lysis. Alternatively, donor cells are coated with alloantibodies that initiate phagocytosis through Fc receptors of mononuclear leukocytes. Mechanism of humoral rejection is relevant for hyperacute, accelerated and chronic rejection.Alloimmunity can be also regulated by neonatal B cells. <big>Cytokines</big> Cytokine microenvironment where CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes recognize alloantigens significantly influences polarization of the immune response. <big>NK cells</big> NK cells can also directly target the transplanted tissue. It depends on the balance of activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors and on their ligands expressed by the graft. Receptors of KIR (Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor) family bind concrete MHC class I molecules. If the graft has these ligands on its surface, NK cell cannot be activated (KIR receptors provide inhibitory signal). So if these ligands are missing, there is no inhibitory signal and NK cell becomes activated. It recognizes target cells by “missing-self strategy” and induces their apoptosis by enzymes perforin and granzymes released from its cytotoxic granules. Alloreactive NK cells also secrete proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α to increase expression of MHC molecules and costimulatory receptors on the surface of APCs (antigen-presenting cells). This promotes APC maturation which leads to amplification of T-cell alloreactivity by means of direct and also indirect pathway of alloantigen recognition (as described below). NK cells are able to kill Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T-lymphocytes as well and shift the immune response from graft tolerance toward its rejection. Besides the ability of NK cells to influence APC maturation and T cell development, they can probably reduce or even prevent alloimmune response to transplanted tissue – either by killing the recipient’s APCs or by anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and TGF-β secretion. However it is important to note that NK cell sub-populations differ in alloreactivity rate and in their immunomodulatory potential.Concerning immunosuppressive drugs, the effects on NK cells are milder in comparison to T cells. <big>T-lymphocytes</big> Alloantigen recognition Alloantigen on APC surface can be recognized by recipient’s T-lymphocytes through two different pathways: Activation of T-lymphocytes T-lymphocytes are fully activated under two conditions: Alloimmune response can be enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines and by CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes that are responsible for APC maturation and IL-2 production. IL-2 is crucial for memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell development. These cells may represent a serious problem after the transplantation. As the effect of being exposed to various infections in the past, antigen-specific T-lymphocytes have developed in patient’s body. Part of them is kept in organism as memory cells and these cells could be a reason for “cross-reactivity” – immune response against unrelated but similar graft alloantigens. This immune response is called secondary and is faster, more efficient and more robust. Transplanted tissue is accepted by immunocompetent recipient if it is functional in the absence of immunosuppressive drugs and without histologic signs of rejection. Host can accept another graft from the same donor but reject graft from different donor. Graft acceptance depends on the balance of proinflammatory Th1, Th17 lymphocytes and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells. This is influenced by cytokine microenvironment, as mentioned before, where CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes are activated and also by inflammation level (because pathogens invading organism activate the immune system to various degrees and causing proinflammatory cytokine secretion, therefore they support the rejection). Immunosuppressive drugs are used to suppress the immune response, but the effect is not specific. Therefore organism can be affected by the infection or cancer much more easily. The goal of the future therapies is to suppress the alloimmune response specifically to prevent these risks.The tolerance could be achieved by elimination of most or all alloreactive T cells and by influencing alloreactive effector-regulatory T-lymphocytes ratio in favor of regulatory cells which could inhibit alloreactive effector cells. Another method would be based on costimulatory signal blockade during alloreactive T-lymphocytes activation.
