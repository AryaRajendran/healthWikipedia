 Visceroptosis (or enteroptosis) is a prolapse or a sinking of the abdominal viscera (internal organs) below their natural position. Any or all of the organs may be displaced downward. When the intestines are involved, the condition is known as enteroptosis; when the stomach is found below its normal position, the term gastroptosis is used. The disease exists in all degrees of severity and may give rise to no symptoms whatsoever. Generally, however, there is loss of appetite, heartburn, nervous dyspepsia, constipation, or diarrhea, abdominal distention, headache, vertigo, emaciation, and loss of sleep. Any or all of these symptoms may be present. The condition is brought about by loss of muscular tone, particularly of the abdominal muscles, intestinal autointoxication, with relaxation of the ligaments which hold the viscera in place. In women, tight lacing has been held to be a frequent cause. The symptoms may be alleviated by supporting the organs with a properly applied bandage, or other similar device. Rest in bed, attention to diet, hygiene, exercise, and general muscular upbuilding will cure the majority of cases. In others operation may become necessary. Visceroptosis is a known risk factor for the development of Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome. Visceroptosis is also called splanchnoptosis, abdominal ptosis, and Glénard's disease, after a French physician Frantz Glénard (1848–1920).
