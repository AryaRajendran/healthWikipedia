 RUB A535 (also known as Antiphlogistine) is a rubefacient introduced in 1919 and manufactured by Church and Dwight in Canada. While relatively unknown outside of Canada (it is not sold in the US), it is indeed a popular product for the treatment of tough muscle pain, arthritic pains, rheumatic pains, bursitis, lumbago, etc. Church and Dwight claim that (on their website) nearly all the research, development and production of RUB A535 was and still is done in Canada. Patients who are allergic to salicylates (ASA based drugs, such as Aspirin ), or who are taking anticoagulant medications should avoid the use of the product. It is also recommended to not use it more than 3-4 times a day. The active ingredients in RUB A535 are camphor, eucalyptus oil, menthol, and methyl salicylate. Currently, RUB A535 has been released in a variety of products: [[Category:Church & Dwight brands]]
