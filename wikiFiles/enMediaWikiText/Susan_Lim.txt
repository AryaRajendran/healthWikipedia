 Susan Lim is a Singaporean surgeon who performed the first successful liver transplant in Singapore in 1990. Lim was born in Singapore and was educated at Singapore Chinese Girls' School and Raffles Institution. In 1974 she was awarded a scholarship under the Colombo Plan to study medicine at Monash University in Australia. In 2003 Lim started the biotechnology company Stem Cell Technologies. The following year she became a Fellow of Trinity College (University of Melbourne). She is the youngest and first Singaporean to receive this honor. Lim established the Indiapore Trust with her husband Deepak Sharma and her friend Satpal Khattar. The trust issued $50,000 to the Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund, which assists struggling parents to meet their children's school expenses. The trust has also donated a science laboratory to Raffles Junior College and provided scholarships to underprivileged children in Singapore and India. Lim sits on the Global Advisory Council of the International Society for Stem Cell Research. In April 2011 she gave a presentation at TED on Transplanting Cells, Not Organs. In October 2011 Lim was included in The University of Newcastle's book 100 Women, which celebrates the achievements of 100 remarkable and inspirational women, both in Australia and globally. In February 2011 the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) presented a case to the Ministry of Health, in which Lim was accused of overcharging one of her patients. In August 2012 Lim was convicted, issued a 3-year suspension from practicing, and fined. The patient was a member of the royal family of Brunei and Lim was required to submit a written promise not to overcharge in the future. Lim appealed her sentence and was allowed to continue practicing, pending the outcome of the appeal. {{Persondata | NAME = Lim, Susan | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION =| DATE OF BIRTH =| PLACE OF BIRTH = Singapore | DATE OF DEATH =| PLACE OF DEATH =| CHILDREN = 3 (1 son and 2 daughters, from former marriage)}}
