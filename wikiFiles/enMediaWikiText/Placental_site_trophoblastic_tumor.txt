 Placental site trophoblastic tumor is a form of gestational trophoblastic disease, which is thought to arise from intermediate trophoblast. It may secrete human placental lactogen (human chorionic somatomammotropin), and result in a false-positive pregnancy test. Placental Site Trophoblastic Tumor is a monophasic neoplasm of the implantation site intermediate trophoblast, and usually a benign lesion, which comprises less than 2% of all gestational trophoblastic proliferations. Preceding conditions include molar pregnancy(5%). Compared to choriocarcinoma or invasive mole, hemorrhage is less conspicuous and serum Î²-HCG level is low, making early diagnosis difficult. Immunohistochemistry: Often stains with hPL, keratin, Mel-CAM, EGFR. Prognosis : 10~20% of cases metastase leading to death. Treatment : Because chemotherapy is ineffective; the patient should undergo hysterectomy.
