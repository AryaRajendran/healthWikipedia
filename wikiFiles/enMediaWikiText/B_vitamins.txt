 B vitamins are a group of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism. The B vitamins were once thought to be a single vitamin, referred to as vitamin B (much as people refer to vitamin C). Later research showed that they are chemically distinct vitamins that often coexist in the same foods. In general, supplements containing all eight are referred to as a vitamin B complex. Individual B vitamin supplements are referred to by the specific name of each vitamin (e.g., B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> etc.). Vitamin !! Name !! Structure!! Molecular Function Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> Thiamine Vitamin B<sub>2</sub> Riboflavin Vitamin B<sub>3</sub> Niacin Vitamin B<sub>5</sub> Pantothenic acid Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Pyridoxine Vitamin B<sub>7</sub> Biotin Vitamin B<sub>9</sub> Folic Acid Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> Cobalamin Several named vitamin deficiency diseases may result from the lack of sufficient B-vitamins. Deficiencies of other B vitamins result in symptoms that are not part of a named deficiency disease. Vitamin Name Deficiency effects Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> thiamine Deficiency causes beriberi. Symptoms of this disease of the nervous system include weight loss, emotional disturbances, Wernicke's encephalopathy (impaired sensory perception), weakness and pain in the limbs, periods of irregular heartbeat, and edema (swelling of bodily tissues). Heart failure and death may occur in advanced cases. Chronic thiamine deficiency can also cause Korsakoff's syndrome, an irreversible psychosis characterized by amnesia and confabulation. - Vitamin B<sub>2</sub> riboflavin Deficiency causes ariboflavinosis. Symptoms may include cheilosis (cracks in the lips), high sensitivity to sunlight, angular cheilitis, glossitis (inflammation of the tongue), seborrheic dermatitis or pseudo-syphilis (particularly affecting the scrotum or labia majora and the mouth), pharyngitis (sore throat), hyperemia, and edema of the pharyngeal and oral mucosa. - Vitamin B<sub>3</sub> niacin Deficiency, along with a deficiency of tryptophan causes pellagra. Symptoms include aggression, dermatitis, insomnia, weakness, mental confusion, and diarrhea. In advanced cases, pellagra may lead to dementia and death (the 3(+1) Ds: dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and death). - Vitamin B<sub>5</sub> pantothenic acid Deficiency can result in acne and paresthesia, although it is uncommon. - Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> pyridoxine Deficiency may lead to microcytic anemia (because pyridoxyl phosphate is the cofactor for heme synthesis), depression, dermatitis, high blood pressure (hypertension), water retention, and elevated levels of homocysteine. - Vitamin B<sub>7</sub> biotin Deficiency does not typically cause symptoms in adults but may lead to impaired growth and neurological disorders in infants. Multiple carboxylase deficiency, an inborn error of metabolism, can lead to biotin deficiency even when dietary biotin intake is normal. - Vitamin B<sub>9</sub> folic acid Deficiency results in a macrocytic anemia, and elevated levels of homocysteine. Deficiency in pregnant women can lead to birth defects. Supplementation is often recommended during pregnancy. Researchers have shown that folic acid might also slow the insidious effects of age on the brain. - Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> cobalamin Deficiency results in a macrocytic anemia, elevated homocysteine, peripheral neuropathy, memory loss and other cognitive deficits. It is most likely to occur among elderly people, as absorption through the gut declines with age the autoimmune disease pernicious anemia is another common cause. It can also cause symptoms of mania and psychosis. In rare extreme cases, paralysis can result. Because water-soluble B vitamins are eliminated in the urine, taking large doses of certain B vitamins may produce transient effects. {| class="wikitable"|-| Vitamin || Name || Tolerable Upper Intake Level || Harmful effects || No known toxicity from oral intake. There are some reports of anaphylaxis caused by high-dose thiamine injections into the vein or muscle. However, the doses were greater than the quantity humans can physically absorb from oral intake. || Intake of more than 1000 mg/day is associated with peripheral sensory neuropathy; other effects are unconfirmed: dermatological lesions [causal association is unlikely]; B<sub>6</sub> dependency in newborns [causal association is also unlikely]. || Masks B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, which can lead to permanent neurological damage || Acne-like rash [causality is not conclusively established]. B vitamins are found in whole unprocessed foods. Processed carbohydrates such as sugar and white flour tend to have lower B vitamin than their unprocessed counterparts. For this reason, it is required by law in the United States (and many other countries) that the B vitamins thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and folic acid be added back to white flour after processing. This is sometimes called "Enriched Flour" on food labels. B vitamins are particularly concentrated in meat such as turkey, tuna and liver. Good sources for B vitamins include kombucha, whole grains, potatoes, bananas, lentils, chili peppers, tempeh, beans, nutritional yeast, brewer's yeast, and molasses. Although the yeast used to make beer results in beers being a source of B vitamins, their bioavailability ranges from poor to negative as drinking ethanol inhibits absorption of thiamine (B<sub>1</sub>), riboflavin (B<sub>2</sub>), niacin (B<sub>3</sub>), biotin (B<sub>7</sub>), and folic acid (B<sub>9</sub>). In addition, each of the preceding studies further emphasizes that elevated consumption of beer and other ethanol-based drinks results in a net deficit of those B vitamins and the health risks associated with such deficiencies. The B<sub>12</sub> vitamin is of note because it is not available from plant products, making B<sub>12</sub> deficiency a legitimate concern for vegans. Manufacturers of plant-based foods will sometimes report B<sub>12</sub> content, leading to confusion about what sources yield B<sub>12</sub>. The confusion arises because the standard US Pharmacopeia (USP) method for measuring the B<sub>12</sub> content does not measure the B<sub>12</sub> directly. Instead, it measures a bacterial response to the food. Chemical variants of the B<sub>12</sub> vitamin found in plant sources are active for bacteria, but cannot be used by the human body. This same phenomenon can cause significant over-reporting of B<sub>12</sub> content in other types of foods as well. Another popular means of increasing one's vitamin B intake is through the use of dietary supplements. B vitamins are also commonly added to energy drinks, many of which have been marketed with large amounts of B vitamins with claims that this will cause the consumer to "sail through your day without feeling jittery or tense." Some nutritionists have been critical of these claims, pointing out for instance that while B vitamins do "help unlock the energy in foods," most Americans acquire the necessary amounts easily in their diets. Because they are soluble in water, excess B vitamins (such as may be ingested via supplements) are generally readily excreted, although individual absorption, use and metabolism may vary…" The elderly and athletes may need to supplement their intake of B<sub>12</sub> and other B vitamins due to problems in absorption and increased needs for energy production. In cases of severe deficiency B vitamins, especially B<sub>12</sub>, may also be delivered by injection to reverse deficiencies. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetics may also be advised to supplement thiamine based on high prevalence of low plasma thiamine concentration and increased thiamine clearance associated with diabetes. Also, Vitamin B<sub>9</sub> (folic acid) deficiency in early embryo development has been linked to neural tube defects. Thus, women planning to become pregnant are usually encouraged to increase daily dietary folic acid intake and/or take a supplement. Many of the following substances have been referred to as vitamins as they were once believed to be vitamins. They are no longer considered as such, and the numbers that were assigned to them now form the "gaps" in the true series of B-complex vitamins described above (e.g., there is no vitamin B<sub>4</sub>). Some of them, though not essential to humans, are essential in the diets of other organisms; others have no known nutritional value and may even be toxic under certain conditions.
