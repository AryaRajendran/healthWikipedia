 QRISK2 (the most recent version of QRISK) is a prediction algorithm for cardiovascular disease (CVD) that uses traditional risk factors (age, systolic blood pressure, smoking status and ratio of total serum cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) together with body mass index, ethnicity, measures of deprivation, family history, chronic kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, diabetes and antihypertensive treatment. A QRISK over 20 (20% risk of CVD event over the next ten years) indicates that primary prevention with lipid lowering therapy (such as statins) should be initiated. In the UK, current NICE guidelines urge research on the use of www.qrisk.org as a possible alternative to the more widely used Framingham risk score. The algorithm has subsequently been validated by an independent team using an external dataset. The results were published in the BMJ and demonstrated that QRISK performed better than Framingham [1]. www.qrisk.org is updated annually to reflect changes in populations, data quality and national guidelines (such as a change in age range over which cardiovascular risk should be assessed). The inclusion of ethnicity and deprivation in the QRISK2 algorithm is designed to help prevent widening health inequalities. The QIntervention website combines www.qrisk.org with a similar risk prediction tool (www.qdiabetes.org) to calculate risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. www.qintervention.org also allows clinicians to assess 'what if' scenarios i.e. how risk might change with modification of risk factors such as weight loss, stopping smoking, use of statins and better blood pressure control. QRISK has also been developed further to estimate individualised lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Other risk clinical prediction tools developed from the QResearch database include www.qfracture.orgwww.qkidney.orgwww.qthrombosis.orgwww.qcancer.orgwww.qdiabetes.org <div style="font-size:90%;"></div>
