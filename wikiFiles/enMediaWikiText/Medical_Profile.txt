 The Medical Profile (or ) is the system of numbers the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) uses to indicate the medical suitability of a person in order to serve in various positions in the IDF. The profiles range between 21 (which dismisses the subject from serving in the IDF automatically) and 97 (which allows the subject to apply to every unit in the IDF). A profile of 64 and under makes it impossible to serve as a combatant. The profile is determined for the first time after passing the screening process for military service in the recruitment office, and may vary during the entire military service (regular and reserve), after events that change the state of health of the soldier. Sometimes it could go down only for a while, due to a temporal deterioration of the health of the soldier (for example, after an injury).
