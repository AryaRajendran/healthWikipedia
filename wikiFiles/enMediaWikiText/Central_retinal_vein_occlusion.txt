 The central retinal vein is the venous equivalent of the central retinal artery and, like that blood vessel, it can suffer from occlusion (central retinal vein occlusion, also CRV), similar to that seen in ocular ischemic syndrome. Since the central retinal artery and vein are the sole source of blood supply and drainage for the retina, such occlusion can lead to severe damage to the retina and blindness, due to ischemia (restriction in blood supply) and edema (swelling). It can also cause glaucoma. Nonischemic CRVO is the milder form of the disease. It may progress to the more severe ischemic type. Treatment consists of Anti-VEGF drugs like Lucentis or intravitreal steroid implant (Ozurdex) and Pan-Retinal Laser Photocoagulation usually. Underlying conditions also require treatment. Non-Ischemic CRVO has better visual prognosis than Ischemic CRVO. Central retinal vein occlusion results in 100 day glaucoma.
