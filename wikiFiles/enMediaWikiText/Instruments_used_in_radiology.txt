 Instruments used specially in radiology are as follows:__Forcetoc__ Instrument !! Uses Ultrasonography machine uses ultrasound to produce images from within the body X-ray uses X-rays to produce images of structures within the body Contrast media for X-rays to provide a high contrast image of the details of the viscera under study Echocardiography machine sonography of the heart is done here to know its function and state Computer axial tomography scan (CT Scan)/(CAT Scan) || to visualize the interior of the body in slices (traditionally showing horizontal slices); vide link Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alias Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) high strength (0.15 to 1.5 teslas) are used to excite protons that produce the record results (like CT scan). It can show particular tissues more clearly than CT. Linear accelerator used in radiotherapy for cancer Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) vide link Positron emission tomography (PET Scan) vide link Radio-isotope scan or nuclear scintigraphy These radioactive compounds are administered so that specific tissues take them up. The amount and anatomical detail of the uptake produces the scan result. SPECT scan vide link Interventional radiology minimally invasive surgeries under radiological imaging, e.g. angioplasty, TIPS.
