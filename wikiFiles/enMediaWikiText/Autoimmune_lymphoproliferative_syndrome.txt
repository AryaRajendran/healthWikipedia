 Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a form of lymphoproliferative disorder (LPDs). It affects lymphocyte apoptosis. It is a RASopathy. Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome is a rare disorder of abnormal lymphocyte survival caused by defective Fas mediated apoptosis. Normally, after infectious insult, the immune system down-regulates by increasing Fas expression on activated B and T lymphocytes and Fas-ligand on activated T lymphocytes. Fas and Fas-ligand interact to trigger the caspase cascade, leading to cell apoptosis. Patients with ALPS have a defect in this apoptotic pathway, leading to chronic non-malignant lymphoproliferation, autoimmune disease, and secondary cancers. This condition is usually caused by mutations in the FAS gene. Rarely cases due to mutations in other genes including the FAS ligand gene have been reported. Lymphoproliferation: The most common clinical manifestation of ALPS is lymphoproliferation, affecting 100% of patients. Autoimmune disease: The second most common clinical manifestation and one that most often requires treatment. Old nomenclature Revised nomenclature (2010) Old criteria New criteria
