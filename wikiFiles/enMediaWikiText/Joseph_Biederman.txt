In 2007, Biederman was ranked as the second highest producer of high-impact papers in psychiatry overall throughout the world with 235 papers cited a total of 7048 times over the past 10 years as determined by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). The same organization ranked Biederman at #1 in terms of total citations to his papers published on ADD/ADHD in the past decade. Biederman was the recipient of the 1998 NAMI Exemplary Psychiatrist award paid for by big pharma.

In 2008, Congress investigated charges that Biederman earned consulting fees of at least $1.6 million dollars over eight years from pharmaceutical companies, but did not report much of this income to university officials. [[Johnson & Johnson]] gave more than $700,000 to a research center that was headed by Biederman from 2002 to 2005, and some of its research was about Risperdal, the company's antipsychotic drug. Biederman responded saying that the money did not influence him and that he did not promote a specific diagnosis or treatment. In 2011, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School disciplined three psychiatrists, including Biederman, for violating conflict of interest polices. {{Persondata | NAME = Biederman, Joseph | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION =| DATE OF BIRTH =| PLACE OF BIRTH =| DATE OF DEATH =| PLACE OF DEATH =}}
