His main research interests are children who seem to remember previous lives, and prenatal and birth memories. He is the author of Life Before Life: A Scientific Investigation of Children’s Memories of Previous Lives, which presents an overview of over 40 years of reincarnation research at the Division of Perceptual Studies. Tucker, a board-certified child psychiatrist, worked for several years on this research with Ian Stevenson before taking over upon Stevenson’s retirement in 2002. Tucker has also appeared in print as well as broadcast media<ref name=adler>The Charles Adler Show CJOB/68. June 2009 talking about his work. His investigation of the case of Cameron Macaulay was featured in the Channel 5 documentary Extraordinary People - The Boy Who Lived Before. Tucker attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a BA Degree in psychology and a medical degree. He is currently Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences, and in addition to conducting research, he is the medical director of the University of Virginia Child & Family Psychiatry Clinic. He lives in Charlottesville, VA with his wife, Christine McDowell Tucker, a clinical psychologist, and has presented at academic and public conferences.Tucker felt unfulfilled by his work in child psychiatry, but was open to the possibility that humans are more than their physical bodies and wished to investigate the matter further. Though raised as a Southern Baptist, Tucker does not subscribe to any particular religion, and claims to be skeptical about reincarnation,but sees it as providing the best explanation for phenomena associated with the strongest cases investigated to date. After reading Ian Stevenson's work Tucker became intrigued by children’s reported past-life memories and by the prospect of studying them. While Ian Stevenson focused on cases in Asia, Tucker has studied American children. Tucker reports that in about 70% of the cases of children claiming to remember past lives the deceased died from an unnatural cause, suggesting that traumatic death may be linked to the hypothesized survival of personality. He further indicates that the time between death and apparent rebirth is, on average, 16 months, and that unusual birthmarks might match fatal wounds suffered by the deceased. Tucker has developed the Strength Of Case Scale (SOCS), which evaluates what Tucker sees as four aspects of potential cases of reincarnation; "(1) whether it involves birthmarks/defects that correspond to the supposed previous life; (2) the strength of the statements about the previous life; (3) the relevant behaviours as they relate to the previous life; and (4) an evaluation of the possibility of a connection between the child reporting a previous life and the supposed previous life". Although critics have argued there is no physical explanation for the survival of personality, Tucker suggests that quantum mechanics may offer a mechanism by which memories and emotions could carry over from one life to another. He argues that since the act of observation collapses wave equations, consciousness may not be merely a by-product of the physical brain but rather a separate entity in the universe that impinges on the physical. Tucker argues that viewing consciousness as a fundamental, non-physical, part of the universe makes it possible to conceive of it continuing to exist after the death of the physical brain. He provides the analogy of a television set and the television transmission; the television is required to decode the signal, but it does not create the signal. In a similar way the brain may be required for consciousness to express itself, but may not be the source of consciousness. On the other hand Susan Huelga, a lecturer in quantum mechanics at the University Of Hertfordshire, notes that brain dynamics are highly complex, and she finds that there is no more evidence that quantum mechanics is relevant in this field than that it is relevant regarding whether or not God exists. Since taking over the research into claimed past life memories from Ian Stevenson in 2002, Tucker has been interviewed about reincarnation in print and broadcast media in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. In 2006, Tucker investigated the case of Cameron Macaulay as part of the Channel 5 Documentary Extraordinary People: The Boy Who Lived Before. Tucker’s investigation took him firstly to Glasgow to interview the six-year-old and his mother Norma about Cameron’s reported recollections of life on the isle of Barra in the Outer Hebrides, around 200 miles from the family’s home in Glasgow. Tucker then accompanied the family as they traveled to Barra in an attempt to verify Cameron’s statements about life on the island. The documentary also briefly covered another of Tucker’s cases: that of Gus Taylor from the American Midwest, who reportedly claimed from around the age of 18-months to be his own grandfather returned to the family. In addition to speaking of a previous life, Tucker notes that both boys speak of falling through a ‘porthole’ or ‘hole’ from one life to the next. In 2009, he was interviewed on Larry King Live about the cases he has studied. {{Persondata | NAME = Tucker, Jim | ALTERNATIVE NAMES =| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American psychiatrist | DATE OF BIRTH =| PLACE OF BIRTH =| DATE OF DEATH =| PLACE OF DEATH =}}
