 A stretcher is a medical device used for short-term carrying of patients who require medical care. Stretchers are primarily used in acute out-of-hospital care situations by EMS, military, and Search and rescue personnel. Stretchers can be equipped with a variable height lower frame containing wheels, tracks, or skids to allow the stretcher to be moved more easily. A simple stretcher does not have such a frame and therefore needs to be carried by two or more people. Despite these differences, their essential function remains the same. They can often be referred to as a cot, litter, gurney, bed or cart Stretchers have been used since antiquity, on battlefields and in emergency situations, where wheeled vehicles are hindered by rough terrain. In their simplest form, they generally consisted of a canvas sling with long edges sewn to themselves to form pockets through with wooden poles could be slid. This form was common with militaries right through the middle of the 20th century, and in disaster situations, where rapid triage and movement of patients based on severity of injuries is critical, they are still used by emergency response providers. Many stretcher are referred to as "gurneys". The name gurney comes from its similarity to a horse-drawn cab patented in the U.S. in 1883 by J. Theodore Gurney. Some manufacturers have begun to offer hybrid devices that combine the functionality of a stretcher, a recliner chair, and a treatment or procedural table into one device.
