 Respiratory failure (also known as hypoxia) is inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system, with the result that levels of arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide or both cannot be maintained within their normal ranges. A drop in blood oxygenation is known as hypoxemia; a rise in arterial carbon dioxide levels is called hypercapnia. The normal reference values are: oxygen PaO<sub>2</sub> greater than , and carbon dioxide PaCO<sub>2</sub> less than . Classification into type I or type II relates to the absence or presence of hypercapnia respectively. Type 1 respiratory failure is defined as hypoxia without hypercapnia, and indeed the P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> may be normal or low. It is typically caused by a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch; the volume of air flowing in and out of the lungs is not matched with the flow of blood to the lungs. The basic defect in type 1 respiratory failure is failure of oxygenation characterized by: |P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || low (< )|-| P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> || normal or low (<)|-| P<sub>A-a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || increased|} This type of respiratory failure is caused by conditions that affect oxygenation such as: The basic defect in type 2 respiratory failure is characterized by: |P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || decreased (< )|-| P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> || increased (> )|-| P<sub>A-a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> || normal|-|pH || decreased|} Type 2 respiratory failure is caused by inadequate ventilation; both oxygen and carbon dioxide are affected. Defined as the build up of carbon dioxide levels (P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) that has been generated by the body. The underlying causes include: Emergency treatment follows the principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Treatment of the underlying cause is required. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in severe respiratory failure ( PaO2 less than 50 mmHg ) required. Respiratory stimulants such as doxapram may be used, and if the respiratory failure resulted from an overdose of sedative drugs such as opioids or benzodiazepines, then the appropriate antidote such as naloxone or flumazenil will be given.
