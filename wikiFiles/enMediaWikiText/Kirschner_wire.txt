 Kirschner wires or K-wires or pins are sterilized, sharpened, smooth stainless steel pins. Introduced in 1909 by Martin Kirschner, the wires are now widely used in orthopaedics and other types of medical and veterinary surgery. They come in different sizes and are used to hold bone fragments together (pin fixation) or to provide an anchor for skeletal traction. The pins are often driven into the bone through the skin (percutaneous pin fixation) using a power or hand drill. They also form part of the Ilizarov apparatus. Threaded K-wires are manufactured. They are used in situations where backing out of the pin is undesirable but they are weaker."Denham Pins" are strong stout wires with a threaded portion in the middle. They are used for skeletal traction with the threads engaging the bone.
