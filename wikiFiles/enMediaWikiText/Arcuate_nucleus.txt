 The arcuate nucleus (or infundibular nucleus) is an aggregation of neurons in the mediobasal hypothalamus, adjacent to the third ventricle and the median eminence. The arcuate nucleus includes several important populations of neurons, including: neuroendocrine neurons, centrally-projecting neurons, and others. The arcuate nucleus also contains a population of specialized ependymal cells, called tanycytes.
