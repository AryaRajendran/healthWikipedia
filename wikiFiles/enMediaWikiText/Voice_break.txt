 A voice break, voice change, or voice mutation commonly refers to the deepening of the voice associated with puberty. Before puberty, boys and girls have roughly the same vocal pitch, but during puberty the male voice develops a deeper pitch. Girls' voices usually only deepen by a couple of tones and the change may be difficult to detect. A similar effect is a voice crack in which a person's voice suddenly and unintentionally enters a higher register (usually falsetto) for a brief period of time. This may be caused by singing at a pitch outside of the person's vocal range, stress, emotional tension, or the physical changes associated with puberty. The puberty-associated cracks are only temporary and generally reduce in frequency as a child reaches maturity. Under the influence of androgens, the voice box, or larynx, grows in both sexes. This growth is far more prominent in boys than in girls and causes the voice to drop and deepen during puberty. Along with the larynx, the vocal folds (vocal chords) grow significantly longer and become thicker. In addition, the facial bones begin to grow. Cavities in the sinuses, the nose, and the back of the throat grow bigger, creating more space within the head to allow the voice to resonate. Cartilage within the facial area can move into as many as 170 different positions. The glottis narrows, controlling the flow of air, which causes the vocal folds to vibrate and create sound. Most of the voice change begins around age 12 or 13. Full adult pitch is attained at an average age of 15 years. It usually precedes the development of significant facial hair by several months to years. Occasionally, voice change is accompanied by unsteadiness of vocalization in the early stages of untrained voices. Due to the drop in pitch to the vocal range people may unintentionally speak in head voice using pitches which were formally chest voice. In Europe, when women were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church, they received little chance for professional voice training, resulting in a shortage of trained woman sopranos to sing in opera. Promising boys were castrated to prevent their voices breaking at puberty and to allow them to keep their treble voice. As their voices deteriorated over time, they moved from being opera soloists back into church choirs, which was usually the only job available to them. The first documents mentioning castrati are Italian church records from the 1550s. Mozart's Exultate Jubilate, Allegri's Miserere and other famous pieces from this period now sung by sopranos and countertenors were written for castrati. Two alto arias of Handel's Messiah were rewritten by Handel for the castrato Gaetano Guadagni. Other famous castrati include Farinelli, Senesino, Carestini, and Caffarelli. Acclaimed composer Joseph Haydn was choirboy in his youth and would have been castrated had he not incurred the wrath of his choirmaster and been expelled. The last castrato was Alessandro Moreschi (1858â€“1922) who served in the Sistine Chapel Choir. In the late 19th century, the Roman Catholic Church, which had always considered castration to be mutilation of the body and therefore a severe sin, officially condemned the production of castrati.
