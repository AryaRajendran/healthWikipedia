 Red blood cell indices are blood tests that provide information about the hemoglobin content and size of red blood cells. Abnormal values indicate the presence of anemia and which type of anemia it is. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is the average size of a red blood cell and is calculated by dividing the hematocrit (Hct) by the red blood cell count. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is the average amount of hemoglobin (Hb) per red blood cell and is calculated by dividing the hemoglobin by the red blood cell count. Ã— Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is the average concentration of hemoglobin per red blood cell and is calculated by dividing the hemoglobin by the hematocrit.
