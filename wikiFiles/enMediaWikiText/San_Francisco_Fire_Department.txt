 The San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) provides fire and emergency medical services to the City and County of San Francisco, California. The San Francisco Fire Department, along with the San Francisco Police Department and San Francisco Sheriff's Department, serves an estimated population of 1.4 million people (which includes the approximately 850,000 citizens residing in the of San Francisco (including Treasure Island, Yerba Buena Island and the Presidio of San Francisco), the daytime-commuter population, and the thousands of other visitors, tourists, and others present in the city every day) with approximately 1,700 firefighting and emergency medical field personnel. The department responds to, on average, approximately 73,000 emergency calls annually, with over 80% being emergency medical calls. Volunteer companies were first formed in the city in 1850, and a paid staff established in 1866. In 1906, the department was considered on a par with those of the larger cities on the East Coast, but found itself reduced to fighting the fire of 1906 in the quake aftermath with axes and shovels, as most of the city's water mains were broken and cisterns drained. Fire Chief Dennis Sullivan was killed in his home by a falling chimney early in the disaster.
