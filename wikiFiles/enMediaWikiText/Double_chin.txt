 A double chin is a layer of subcutaneous fat around the neck that sags down and creates a wrinkle, making the owner appear to have a second chin. It is most common on people who are elderly or obese. A person of average weight can bear a double chin as well, depending on their bone structure, amount of loose skin, and amount of fat cells in that region. It is more visible when the bottom jaw is lowered or the head is tilted down. A cosmetic surgeon can remove the fat pad under the chin and shorten the muscles under the jaw to remove the double chin. This procedure involves a small horizontal cut under the double chin to remove the fat beneath the skin. Afterwards, a vertical incision between the layers of the neck and jaw muscle is made. The edges are sewn together to shorten, and therefore tighten, the muscle layer. As with any surgery, complications may arise. Such surgery is a relatively painless and moderately priced procedure.
