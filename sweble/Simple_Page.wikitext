A '''zygote''' is the [[fertilization|fertilized]] [[cell]] that will grow into a baby animal. When a [[female]]'s [[ovum]] and a [[male]]'s [[sperm]] cell [[fertilization|join]], the cell that results is called the zygote. The zygote then multiplies, and grows into an [[embryo]].  So, a zygote is formed from the union of two gametes, and is the first stage in a organism's development. Zygotes are produced by fertilization between two [[haploid]] cells, the ovum and the sperm cells, which make a [[diploid]] cell. Diploid cells have copies of both parents' [[chromosomes]] and [[DNA]].

Some animals keep the zygote in their bodies until it is a full-grown baby. The time between the forming of the zygote and the baby's [[birth]] is called [[pregnancy]]. Other animals do not keep the zygote in their bodies, but lay an [[egg (biology)|egg]]. The zygote grows inside the egg until it is ready and a [[larva]] or baby animal hatches.
